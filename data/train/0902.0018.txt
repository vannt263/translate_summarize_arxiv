    "over the past few years , there has been a marked and still increasing interest in the geometrical and mechanical properties of developable cones or d - cones , illustrated in figure  [ dcone ] .",
    "the d - cone offers an especially simple example of focusing of mechanical stress in a thin elastic sheet owing to the interplay of bending and stretching energy deformation .",
    "several puzzles regarding the scaling of this focusing remain unresolved@xcite .",
    "chief among these is the observed vanishing of mean curvature at the supporting rim of the d - cone .",
    "this paper investigates the possible role of the gauss - bonnet theorem in explaining this vanishing phenomenon .     against a cylindrical container with force @xmath0 .",
    "it has side length @xmath1 , container radius @xmath2 , deflection @xmath3 and thickness @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lattice spacing .",
    "@xmath6 is one boundary of the 60 degree sector opposite to the buckled region .",
    "gaussian curvatures are integrated over the shaded region in sec .",
    "the cylinder is represented by a circular potential shown in sec .",
    "ii.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    .",
    "the slope of the fitted line is -0.092 .",
    "bottom : the residual plot of difference between the data points and the fitted line .",
    "this plot clearly shows that radial curvatures are not zero , especially near the rim where @xmath7.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in principle the shape of a d - cone , including the focusing phenomena noted above , may be found by solving the von krmn equations describing large deformations of thin plates@xcite .",
    "cerda and mahadevan@xcite analyzed the geometry of a single d - cone formed by pushing a thin elastic circular sheet into a cylindrical frame by applying a centered transverse force directed along the axis of the cylinder , in the limit of pure bending .",
    "they obtained the shape of the d - cone by minimizing the bending energy and showed that the aperture angle of the buckled part has a universal value of 139 degrees and that the sheet exerts a concentrated point force to the frame at the two take - off points where the sheet bends away from the frame .",
    "this finding was confirmed by liang and witten@xcite .",
    "these authors@xcite also uncovered a striking spontaneous curvature cancellation phenomenon as noted above .",
    "though the ideal shape of a d - cone has zero radial curvature @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined as radial and angular components in the material coordinate system , the real shape must have nonzero radial curvature at the rim , demonstrated in figure [ kink ] .",
    "the localized force requires an outward radial curvature of the surface so that the surface elements at the frame may maintain equilibrium .",
    "as the thickness of the elastic sheet goes to zero , they found that within the numerical accuracy , the radial curvature @xmath11 and the azimuthal curvature @xmath12 are equal and opposite at the rim , so that the mean curvature virtually vanishes there .",
    "though it arises from mechanical equilibrium , the phenomenon is purely geometric : it does not involve material parameters@xcite .",
    "the von krmn equations must be able to account for the cancellation effect , but this has not been done yet .",
    "any outward radial curvature @xmath11 combined with the inward azimuthal curvature @xmath12 necessarily creates a nonzero gaussian curvature @xmath13 .",
    "the vanishing of mean curvature @xmath14 means that @xmath15 at the rim approaches a nonzero constant as the thickness of the sheet goes to zero .",
    "this contrasts with the overall behavior of thin sheets , which approach the isometric , developable shape for which it must go to zero .",
    "the vanishing mean curvature at the rim amounts to a nonlocal geometrical constraint .",
    "it is nonlocal because it depends on the overall geometry of the sheet .",
    "the curvature does not vanish when one modifies this geometry by cutting the sheet radially or by replacing the flat sheet by a cone@xcite .",
    "the effect also depends on the nonlocal forcing at the vertex .",
    "given the importance of nonlocal geometry , it is natural to look for a connection with the main known geometric constraint on curvature : namely the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "this theorem states that@xcite the integral of gaussian curvature over a region @xmath16 of a surface is related to the integral of the geodesic curvature @xmath17 over the boundary of that region through @xmath18 .",
    "the geodesic curvature for a point on a curve lying on a surface is defined as the curvature of the orthogonal projection of the curve onto the tangent plane to the surface at the point .",
    "as noted below , there is an exact counterpart of the theorem for polyhedral surfaces .",
    "the gauss - bonnet theorem implies that any region of net negative gaussian curvature , such as the d - cone rim , must be compensated by a region of positive curvature elsewhere in the surface or a change in the boundary integral .",
    "our aim in this paper is to determine where the rim curvature is actually compensated .",
    "since the vanishing mean curvature is the result of global forces in the sheet , it would be natural to find that the rim gaussian curvature is compensated by positive gaussian curvature concentrated in the core region .",
    "such nonlocal compensation arises , for example , if one pushes a stretched membrane such as a drum head at an interior point . here",
    "positive gaussian curvature appears at the forcing point . under",
    "weak deformation , as one moves away from the forcing point , the deformation becomes conical , with no gaussian curvature .",
    "the compensating negative gaussian curvature appears only at the constrained boundary of the membrane  the same place where the point force is compensated .",
    "it is natural to expect analogous behavior for the d - cone .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     these gauss - bonnet integrals are expected to be influenced by the elastic thickness @xmath19 of the sheet . as this thickness goes to zero relative to the size @xmath20 of the container , the sheet approaches the isometric state in which the energy penalty for stretching becomes arbitrarily large . in this limit",
    "the gaussian curvature must approach zero at almost every point , since gaussian curvature entails stretching@xcite .",
    "thus the negative contribution to the gauss - bonnet integral near the rim must go to zero .",
    "although this negative contribution becomes small , it must nevertheless be compensated somewhere on the surface .",
    "the compensation could occur far from the rim or close to it .",
    "we may investigate this question by evaluating the integral of @xmath21 in a band near the rim . if the nagative region near the rim is nearly compensated by a positive region within the band , then @xmath22 .",
    "if instead the compensation occurs largely outside the band , then @xmath23 remains finite as the thickness goes to zero .",
    "our numerical study reported below finds that the rim gaussian curvature is compensated locally , not globally .",
    "there is a narrow annulus near the rim where the gauss - bonnet integral nearly vanishes , due to nearly cancelling positive and negative contributions .",
    "there is an analogous local region around the core .",
    "the locality appears to increase for decreasing membrane thickness .",
    "our methods allow us to confirm the vanishing - mean - curvature phenomenon in a new way , using the gaussian curvatures .",
    "the numerical models we used are presented in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe our numerical findings in detail . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss limitations and implications of our findings .",
    "we model an elastic sheet by a triangular lattice of springs of un - stretched length @xmath24 and spring constant @xmath25 after seung and nelson@xcite . bending rigidity",
    "is introduced by assigning an energy of @xmath26 to every pair of adjacent triangles with normals @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "when strains are small compared to unity and radii of curvature are large compared to the lattice spacing @xmath5 , this model is equivalent to an elastic sheet of thickness @xmath29 made of an isotropic , homogeneous material with bending modulus @xmath30 , young s modulus @xmath31 and poisson s ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath5 is set to be 1 .",
    "the shape of the sheet in our simulation is a regular hexagon of side length @xmath33 .",
    "the typical value of @xmath33 is @xmath34 , as indicated in figure [ dcone ] .    to obtain a single d - cone shape , we need to simulate the constraining container rim and pushing force .",
    "the rim lies in the @xmath35 plane and is described by equation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the radius of the container .",
    "the deflection of the sheet is defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the distance by which the center of the sheet has been pushed into the container .",
    "a d - cone with deflection @xmath40 touches the container at distance @xmath41 away from the apex . for each d - cone , we define a constant @xmath42 as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the azimuthal curvature @xmath12 of a cone with opening angle @xmath45 at @xmath46 . in a real d - cone , @xmath42 is slightly different from the square of the azimuthal curvature at the rim due to lattice effect and the finite thickness @xmath47 of the sheet .",
    "@xmath42 should approach @xmath48 at the rim as @xmath47 goes to zero . pushing in the center of the sheet",
    "is accomplished by introducing a repulsive potential of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50^{-1}$ ] , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the coordinates of the lattice point in the center , @xmath54 is a constant of order @xmath55 and @xmath0 is the magnitude of the pushing force .",
    "@xmath56 is introduced to make sure that when the sheet is being pushed the lattice point in the center does not stray away from the axis of the cylindrical container , i.e. @xmath57 . the constraining rim is implemented by a potential of the form @xmath58 ^ 4 $ ] , where @xmath59 is a constant and the summation is over all lattice points with coordinates @xmath60 .",
    "the value of @xmath59 is choosen so that the shortest distance between the lattice points and the rim is close to one lattice spacing .",
    "the conjugate gradient algorithm@xcite is used to minimize the total elastic and potential energy of the system as a function of the coordinates of all lattice points .",
    "this lattice model behaves like a continuum material provided that the curvatures are everywhere sufficiently small compared to @xmath61 .",
    "this restricts the values of deflection @xmath40 of d - cone to be below 0.25@xcite .",
    "@xmath40 is between 0.09 and 0.15 in our simulations .",
    "there are two ways to determine the curvatures .",
    "one way , denoted as scheme 1 , is to obtain the curvature tensor from each triangle in the sheet .",
    "once the curvature tensor is known , gaussian curvature and mean curvature are the determinant and average of the diagonal elements of the tensor , respectively .",
    "for this scheme to work , we have to take the curvature tensor to be constant across each triangle .",
    "we calculate it following @xcite using the relative heights of the six vertices of the three triangles that share a side with the given triangle .",
    "gaussian curvatures can also be obtained by using the angular deficit scheme@xcite based on the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "the angular deficit scheme approximates the gaussian curvature of a smooth surface @xmath62 from the angular deficit of an inscribed polyhedral surface .",
    "the angular deficit of a vertex of a polyhedron is the amount by which the sum of the angles of the faces at the vertex falls short of @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 be a vertex of a polyhedral surface and let its nearest neighbors to be @xmath65 in clockwise direction . in triangle @xmath66 ,",
    "let @xmath67 denote the angle at @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "the angular deficit at @xmath64 is defined as @xmath70 . in our equilateral triangular lattice model , if a vertex @xmath64 is not on the edge of the polyhedral surface , then @xmath71 , and the angular deficit and the gaussian curvature @xmath21 of the smooth surface @xmath72 at @xmath64 satisfy : @xmath73 in the limit of small lattice spacing@xcite . since",
    "angular deficits can be easily calculated in our triangular lattice model , this is a convenient way to evaluate gaussian curvatures . for a vertex @xmath64 on the edge , @xmath74 .",
    "the angular deficit at @xmath64 is @xmath75 where we restrict the angles to those subtending the sheet .",
    "after this adjustment , the sum of the angular deficits over all the vertices on the sheet is equivalent to the sum of angular deficits over all the triangles and should be exactly zero . in our simulation , the magnitude of this sum is on the order of @xmath76 , which is consistent with zero given our numerical round - off errors .",
    "equation ( [ angular_curvature ] ) can be seen as the counterpart of the gauss - bonnet theorem on smooth surface for polyhedral surfaces . in the polyhedral case ,",
    "the gaussian curvature of the surface is concentrated on the vertices .",
    "it is zero on faces and edges . by approximating the polyhedron by a sequence of smooth surfaces , one verifies that @xmath21",
    "consists of @xmath77-function contribution at each vertex @xmath78 each being equal to its angular deficit : @xmath79\\delta ^2 ( \\vec{r}-\\vec{r}_j ) $ ] .",
    "this special case of gaussian - bonnet theorem states that the sum of the angular deficits over all the vertices of a polyhedron is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the euler characteristic of the polyhedron .",
    "for example , if a polyhedron is homeomorphic to a sphere , then its euler characteristic @xmath82 and the total angular deficits of all its vertices is @xmath83 .",
    "so equation ( [ angular_curvature ] ) simply states that in our regular triangular lattice , the gaussian curvature of a smooth surface can be approximated by the normalized gaussian curvature of the discrete lattice .",
    "there is great temptation to generalize this to other kinds of lattices , but it is only true when the geometry of the lattices is precisely controlled@xcite .",
    "these two schemes of obtaining the gaussian curvature give consistent values everywhere on the d - cone except in the core region where the high curvatures invalidate the smoothness assumption of scheme 1 .",
    "all gaussian curvatures presented in subsequent sections are those of our polyhedral surface determined by the angular deficit scheme , the robustness and accuracy of which has been tested extensively@xcite .",
    "numerically , figure  [ radial1 ] shows the gaussian curvature profiles along a radial line @xmath6 that is @xmath84 away from the symmetrical axis of the buckled region as indicated in figure [ dcone ] .",
    "negative gaussian curvatures are observed around @xmath85 in the material coordinate , where the sheet touches the confining rim , just as stated in the introduction .",
    "this negative gaussian curvature decays as one moves inward or outward from the rim , but the decay is not monotonic .",
    "it first goes to zero and then turns positive before approaching zero again .",
    "as expected , gaussian curvatures change very dramatically in the core region .     within each band",
    "@xmath86 as a function of @xmath78 , where @xmath78 represents the material distance from band @xmath86 to the center of the d - cone.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the existence of two regions with positive gaussian curvatures around the contact region seems to indicate that the negative gaussian curvatures in the contact region is compensated locally . to test this , on the d - cone with thickness @xmath4 we integrate the gaussian curvature over a band within the unbuckled region shown as the shaded region in figure [ dcone ] .",
    "the results are as follows : @xmath87 these integrals of the gaussian curvature are two orders of magnitude smaller than the integrals of the absolute value of the gaussian curvature , which means that the negative gaussian curvature at the rim is effectively compensated by the positive gaussian curvature close to the rim , i.e. , the gaussian curvature is compensated locally .    by comparing the radial profiles of the gaussian curvature in figure  [ radial1 ]",
    ", one would notice that the negative gaussian curvature at the rim decays to zero within a shorter distance on the thinner d - cone .",
    "also , on the thinner d - cone the range of two regions of positive gaussian curvature is correspondingly smaller .",
    "this suggests that the locality of the gaussian curvature compensation increases as the thickness of the d - cone decreases .",
    "the local compensation of gaussian curvature applies not only to the unbuckled region , but also to the whole d - cone .",
    "we divide a d - cone into circular bands with each band @xmath86 containing lattice points that satisfy @xmath88 , where @xmath9 is the material distance from the lattice point to the center of the d - cone . then within each band @xmath78",
    ", we integrate the gaussian curvature and denote the integral as @xmath89 .",
    "this @xmath89 is plotted against @xmath78 in figure  [ whole ] . from figure  [ whole ]",
    "we can roughly decompose the d - cone to 3 major regions , the core region with @xmath90 , the rim region with @xmath91 and the edge region with @xmath92 where the integrals are primarily contributed by the buckled region .     at the rim as a function of the thickness of the sheet @xmath47 .",
    "gaussian curvatures at rim points were inferred from interpolation .",
    "these interpolated @xmath93 values were then averaged over the contacting rim.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in the core region , we have @xmath94 and in the rim region , @xmath95 these integrals of the gaussian curvature are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the integrals of the absolute value of the gaussian curvature in both the core and the rim regions , which again suggests that overall the gaussian curvature is compensated locally .    through gaussian curvatures , we can confirm the vanishing - mean - curvature phenomenon .",
    "the vanishing of mean curvature @xmath96 means that the gaussian curvature @xmath21 remains equal to @xmath48 .",
    "since , as stated in sec .",
    "ii , @xmath48 at the rim approaches the constant @xmath42 as the thickness @xmath47 of the sheet goes to zero , the vanishing of the mean curvature would further imply that at the limit @xmath97 , @xmath98 at the rim . in figure [ kvsh ] , there is a clear trend that @xmath99 approaches @xmath100 as @xmath47 goes to zero .",
    "if an external normal point force is applied to an elastic membrane , positive gaussian curvature is necessarily created at the forcing point . in general this",
    "must be compensated by a region of negative gaussian curvature elsewhere in the membrane , owing to the gauss - bonnet theorem . for the case of the d - cone lattice considered here",
    "the content of the theorem is quite precise : the angular deficits defined above must sum to zero .",
    "thus any deficit due to an external force must be exactly compensated elsewhere in the sheet .",
    "this compensation may occur close to the applied force or far from it , depending on the case .",
    "the size of the compensating region can depend on the magnitude of the applied force , the forces at distant boundaries and the elastic thickness of the membrane .",
    "similarly the degree of compensation falls off with distance from the source in a way that depends on the case .",
    "the nature of compensation for weak point forces is tractable using the linearized von krmn equations .",
    "our interest here is the case of the d - cone , where puzzling nonlinear and nonlocal effects like the vanishing of mean curvature at the supporting rim are seen .",
    "as explained above , this vanishing appears to require nonlocal interaction between the rim region and the rest of the system .",
    "any nonlocal compensation of gaussian curvature would provide a potential mechanism for this nonlocal interaction .",
    "however , our numerical analysis shows that the rim gaussian curvature is almost entirely compensated close to the rim .",
    "indeed , the compensation appears to become more local as the elastic thickness of the membrane is reduced .",
    "similar locality appears in the compensation for the central point force .",
    "thus we have found nothing to suggest a coupling of the central region to the rim via the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "our findings here are modest and limited .",
    "we have only explored one structure : the d - cone , although the locality of compensation is of general interest and relevance .",
    "clearly many variants of the d - cone could be studied , as well as many other cases of point forces on curved and strained membranes .",
    "we expect that the increased locality we observed with decreasing thickness obeys some form of scaling behavior , but we have not attempted to determine it numerically or analytically . in order to demonstrate such scaling , any numerical measurement would need to have a finite element scheme with much more dynamic range than the one used here .",
    "the puzzle of vanishing mean curvature at the rim of a d - cone is as open as ever after this study .",
    "our work in preparation investigates the generality of this curvature cancellation and explores simplifying assumptions to enable understanding .",
    "the authors would like to thank konstantin turitsyn and enrique cerda for enlightening discussions .",
