    "when we have a system of a d3-brane and an anti - d3-brane , its dynamics is well described by the effective field theory of a complex tachyon field and u(1)@xmath0u(1 ) gauge fields  @xcite . while the d3 and @xmath4 approach each other from apart , the universe undergoes an inflationary era due to the gravitational effect  @xcite . when the d - brane coincides with the @xmath4-brane , the system reaches the top of the tachyon potential and the main inflation ends",

    "we analyze the df - string solutions with the linearly - divergent @xmath36 and the logarithmically - divergent @xmath36 separately in what follows .    * ( i ) * : if we examine carefully the coupled differential equations ( [ teq])([ceq ] ) , the leading asymptotic behavior of the tachyon amplitude is either linearly - growing or logarithmically - growing",
    ". first , we consider the linearly - growing case .",
    "the subleading term of the tachyon amplitude is decreasing exponentially @xmath186 where @xmath119 and @xmath117 are undetermined constants which are governed by the behavior near the origin . for the gauge field @xmath55 , we consider small @xmath187 at the asymptotic region , @xmath188 substituting this into the equation for the gauge field , we obtain a linear equation , @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 . if we identify @xmath187 as a one - dimensional position of a hypothetical particle , eq .",

    "( ii ) * : lastly let us discuss logarithmic @xmath36-solution of the local df - string . for sufficiently large @xmath110 , the leading logarithmic term has the same coefficient with the global df - string ( [ logsolt ] ) , but the subleading term does not contain logarithmic term ; @xmath206 as we observed in the global string case , the first subleading term of @xmath85 in ( [ loer ] ) is governed only by the leading term of the tachyon amplitude in ( [ logsolt ] ) . therefore",
    ", the expansion for the logarithmic @xmath36-solution is the same for the local string . if we try to get the asymptotic solution of the gauge field @xmath55 similarly to the case of linearly - growing solution ( [ ctn ] )",
    ", the linearized equation for @xmath187 is @xmath207 we find a solution which decreases rapidly to zero , @xmath208 where @xmath209 is an integration constant which is to be set by the boundary conditions at the asymptotic . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the gauge field @xmath55 ( the dashed line ) reaches its boundary value @xmath210 rapidly and the tachyon amplitude @xmath36 ( the solid line ) grows logarithmically .",
    "due to the mixture of slowly - growing and rapidly - growing functional behaviors for single numerical analysis , the results of numerical work need further improvement for this logarithmic case .",
    "this rapidly - decreasing behavior of the gauge field @xmath55 affects that of the u(1 ) current ( [ jth ] ) , but does not appear in the radial pressure ( [ tr ] ) up to the leading order , @xmath211 similar to @xmath85 , all the components of the energy - momentum tensor and the @xmath48-component of the electric flux density for the local df - string have the same functional forms with those of the corresponding components of the global df - string up to the second order terms .",
    "therefore , the leading energy density of the local df - string for the logarithmically - growing tachyon amplitude shares that of the local df - string for the linearly - growing tachyon amplitude and that of the global strings .",
    "it means that the discussion on the energy of the global df - strings can also be applied to that of the local df - strings ; the role of the gauge field @xmath55 in localizing the energy of the string is negligible , which is very different from that in the case of nielsen - olesen vortex - string in the abelian - higgs model .    due to the gauge field @xmath55 ,",

    "the system of d3@xmath4 with fundamental strings has been considered in the coincidence limit of a brane and an anti - brane . in the scheme of effective field theory ,",

    "( see the circles in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . )",
    "introduction of the radial dbi electric field coupled nonminimally to the tachyon is indispensable to obtain a thick d - string , which implies that background fundamental strings live in an extra - dimension with a fluid form and end at each vortex - string origin .",

    "this confined electric flux density tells us that the stringy object of interest carries a fundamental string charge density , so we find it a df - string ( or a @xmath167-string ) .",
    "lastly the nonvanishing gauge field coupled minimally to the tachyon replaces the global df - string by a local df - string carrying a quantized magnetic flux density as a d1 charge density .    now that we have global and local , d- and df - strings as soliton solutions in the context of effective field theory  @xcite , the future tasks to construct a viable cosmic superstring become more tractable",
    ". dynamical issues  @xcite involve ( i ) head - on collision of two d - vortices for checking the intercommuting ( reconnecting ) property of two d - strings , ( ii ) collision of two df - strings leading to a tree structure composed of a pair of trilinear vertices , which is to form a cosmic df - string network  @xcite , and ( iii ) the stability of long macroscopic d- and df - strings .    on cosmological aspects , we would gravitate the obtained static stringy defects and see the resultant spacetime structure .",
    "this may provide a basis to tackle the possibility of observing its effect astrophysically including viable density fluctuations and quintessence  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of time - dependence is also important to understand how the d- and df - strings are generated , and whether or not they survive during the inflationary era induced by the separation of d3 and @xmath4 . to lower the scale from the fundamental string scale to a scale to pass observational tests such as the cosmic microwave background , the pulsar timing , and the gravitational radiation , it is also intriguing to take into account the d- and df - strings obtained in the background of various string ( inspired ) models  @xcite .",
