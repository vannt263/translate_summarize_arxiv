    "the low - lying negative parity states observed in actinides and in heaviest known ba , ce , nd and sm isotopes are definitely related to reflection ",
    "asymmetric shapes @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches to treat collective motion leading to reflection  asymmetric deformations .",
    "one of them is based on the concept of a nuclear mean field which has a static octupole deformation or is characterized by large amplitudes of reflection ",
    "asymmetric vibrations around the equilibrium shape @xcite . in this approach",
    "the parity splitting is explained by octupole deformation .",
    "another approach @xcite is based on the assumption that the reflection ",
    "asymmetric shape is a consequence of alpha  clustering in nuclei @xcite . in the algebraic model @xcite the corresponding wave functions of the ground and excited states consist of components without and with dipole bosons ( in addition to the quadrupole bosons ) , which are related to mononucleus and alpha ",
    "cluster components , respectively .",
    "the variant of algebraic model including the octupole bosons in addition to the dipole bosons has been applied in @xcite to the description of the low - lying negative parity states in actinides . in @xcite a cluster configuration with a lighter cluster heavier than @xmath0he",
    "was used in order to describe the properties of the low  lying positive and negative parity states . in both models @xcite and @xcite the relative distance between the centers of mass of clusters at fixed mass asymmetry is the main collective coordinate for the description of the alternating parity bands .",
    "nuclear cluster effects are mostly pronounced in the light even ",
    "even @xmath1 nuclei with alpha  particle as the natural building block .",
    "there is a nice relationship between alpha  cluster description and deformed shell model @xcite .",
    "it is known from nilsson  strutinsky type calculations for light nuclei that nuclear configurations corresponding to the minima of the potential energy contain particular symmetries which are related to certain cluster structures @xcite . by using antisymmetrized molecular dynamics",
    "approach @xcite , the formation and dissolution of clusters in light nuclei , like @xmath2ne and @xmath3 mg , are described .",
    "the idea of clusterization applied to heavy nuclei does not contradict the mean field approach .",
    "the coexistence of the clustering and of the mean field aspects is a unique feature of nuclear many body system .",
    "the problem of existence of a cluster structure in a ground state of heavy nuclei has attracted much attention , especially , because of the experimentally observed cluster decay @xcite .",
    "the available experimental and theoretical results provide the evidence for existence of fission modes created by the clustering of the fissioning nuclei @xcite .",
    "indications of clusterization of highly deformed nuclei are demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is a development of the cluster  type model which provides not only a qualitative but also a quantitative explanation of the properties of alternating parity bands .",
    "the description of the excitation spectra , @xmath4transition probabilities ( @xmath5=1,2,3 ) and the angular momentum dependence of the parity splitting @xcite are the main subjects of this paper .",
    "our model is based on the assumption that the reflection ",
    "asymmetric shapes are produced by the collective motion of the nuclear system in the mass asymmetry coordinate @xcite .",
    "the values of the odd multipolarity transitional moments ( dipole and octupole ) are strongly correlated with the mass asymmetry deformation of nucleus . in general , the value of the quadrupole moment is related to the degree of the quadrupole correlations ( deformation ) in nucleus . however , the collective motion in the mass asymmetry degree of freedom simultaneously creates a deformation with even and odd multipolarities .",
    "therefore , the calculations of @xmath4transition moments are of interest in the proposed model .",
    "the single particle degrees of freedom are not taken explicitly into consideration since our aim is to show that the suggested cluster model gives a good quantitative explanation of the observed properties of the low  lying negative parity states .",
    "if it is so , this model can serve as a good ground for development of an extended model with additional degrees of freedom .",
    "it should be noted that the first results of calculations of the alternating parity spectra for a few actinides within the cluster model are already presented in the letter @xcite . besides ra , th and u isotopes , in the present paper we present the results of calculations of the energies of alternating parity bands in @xmath6pu , @xmath7ba , @xmath8ce , and @xmath8nd .",
    "the electromagnetic transitions are described in this paper with the cluster model for many nuclei and the spin dependence of the intrinsic quadrupole transition moment is predicted for @xmath9u .",
    "simple analytical expressions obtained for the parity splitting and the spectra of alternating parity bands are useful for the estimations .",
    "the dependence of alpha  clusterization in actinides on the angular momentum is shown for the first time .",
    "dinuclear systems consisting of a heavy cluster @xmath10 and a light cluster @xmath11 were first introduced to explain data on deep inelastic and fusion reactions with heavy ions @xcite .",
    "the mass asymmetry coordinate @xmath12 , defined as @xmath13 , ( @xmath14=1 if @xmath11=0 and @xmath15 ) , which describes a partition of nucleons between the nuclei forming the dinuclear system and the distance @xmath16 between the centers of clusters are used as relevant collective variables @xcite .",
    "the wave function in @xmath12 can be thought as a superposition of different cluster  type configurations including the mononucleus configuration with @xmath14=1 , which are realized with certain probabilities .",
    "the relative contribution of each cluster component in the total wave function is determined by the collective hamiltonian described below .",
    "our calculations have shown that in the considered cases the dinuclear configuration with an alpha cluster ( @xmath17 ) has a potential energy which is close or even smaller than the energy of the mononucleus at @xmath18 @xcite . since the energies of configurations with a light cluster heavier than an @xmath19particle increase rapidly with decreasing @xmath14 , we restrict our investigations to configurations with light clusters not heavier than li ( @xmath20 ) , i.e. to cluster configurations near @xmath18 .    the hamiltonian describing the dynamics in @xmath12 has the following form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the effective mass and @xmath23 is the potential . in order to calculate the dependence of parity splitting on the angular momentum and the electric dipole , quadrupole and octupole transition moments we search for solutions of the stationary schrdinger equation describing the dynamics in @xmath12 : @xmath24 the eigenfunctions @xmath25 of this hamiltonian have a well defined parity with respect to the reflection @xmath26 . before we come to the results of eq .",
    "( [ schr_eq ] ) , we discuss the calculation of the potential @xmath27 , the mass parameter @xmath28 and the moments of inertia @xmath29 appearing in @xmath30 .",
    "the potential @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ ham_eq ] ) is taken as a dinuclear potential energy for @xmath31 @xmath32 here , the internuclear distance @xmath33 is the touching distance between the clusters and is set to be equal to the value corresponding to the minimum of the potential in @xmath16 for a given @xmath12 .",
    "the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( which are negative ) are the experimental binding energies of the clusters forming the dinuclear system at a given mass asymmetry @xmath12 , and @xmath36 is the binding energy of the mononucleus .",

    "it is given as @xmath38 with the coulomb potential @xmath39 , the centrifugal potential @xmath40 and the nuclear interaction @xmath41 .",
    "in the realization of the cluster model developed in this paper , where overlap of clusters is much smaller than in the model of @xcite , the choice of the relevant cluster configuration follows the minimum of the total potential energy of the system with a cluster ",
    "cluster interaction taken additionally into consideration . as the result",
    "we describe the same nuclear properties as in @xcite with configurations of clusters having larger mass asymmetry and a smaller overlap .",
    "the potential @xmath37 and the moment of inertia @xmath42 ) are calculated for special cluster configurations only , namely for the mononucleus ( @xmath14=1 ) and for the two cluster configurations with the @xmath19 and li - clusters as light clusters , respectively .",
    "these calculated points are used later to interpolate the potential smoothly by a polynomial .",
    "the energies of the li - cluster configurations are about 15 mev larger than the binding energies of the mononuclei considered . therefore , for small excitations",
    "only oscillations in @xmath12 are of interest which lie in the vicinity of @xmath14=1 , i.e. only cluster configurations up to li - clusters need to be considered .",
    "the potential @xmath41 is obtained with a double folding procedure with the ground state nuclear densities of the clusters .",
    "antisymmetrization between the nucleons belonging to different clusters is regarded by a density dependence of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon force which gives a repulsive core in the cluster ",

    "the parameters of the nucleon - nucleon interaction are fixed in nuclear structure calculations @xcite .",
    "other details are presented in @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that the potential energy has a minimum at @xmath43=@xmath44 in @xmath45ra and @xmath46th isotopes . in order to demonstrate the dependence of the potential on the neutron number",
    ", we present in fig .  1 calculated values of @xmath47 of configurations with an @xmath19 - cluster taking the long chain of ba isotopes as an example .",
    "in the neutron deficient isotopes @xmath48 is smaller than zero and an @xmath19-clusterization is more likely .",
    "when the neutron number approaches the magic value of 82 , the nucleus becomes stiffer with respect to vibrations in @xmath12 and @xmath48 is larger than zero .",
    "the appearance of two neutrons above shell closure is in favor for an @xmath19 - clusterization . in this case",
    "@xmath48 drops much and again becomes smaller than zero .",
    "further addition of neutrons increases the nuclear stiffness with respect to @xmath12 vibrations .      the calculation of the moment of inertia @xmath49 needed to determine the potential energy at @xmath50 has been described in @xcite . for completeness , we repeat in this subsection the most important information . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the highly deformed states are well described as cluster systems and their moments of inertia are about 85@xmath51 of the rigid - body limit . following this ,",
    "we assume that the moment of inertia of the cluster configurations with @xmath19 and li as light clusters can be expressed as @xmath52 here , @xmath53 are the rigid body moments of inertia for the clusters of the dinuclear system , @xmath54=0.85 @xcite for all considered nuclei and @xmath55 is the nucleon mass .",
    "it should be noted that the angular momentum is treated in this paper as the sum of the angular momentum of the collective rotation of the heavy cluster and of the orbital momentum of the relative motion of the two clusters .",
    "single particle effects , like alignment of the single particle angular momentum in the heavy cluster , are presently disregarded .",
    "for @xmath18 , the value of the moment of inertia is not known from the data because the experimental moment of inertia is a mean value between the moment of inertia of the mononucleus ( @xmath14=1 ) and the ones of the cluster configurations arising due to the oscillations in @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the rigid body moment of inertia of the mononucleus with @xmath58 nucleons calculated with deformation parameters from @xcite and @xmath59 is a scaling parameter which is fixed by the energy of the first 2@xmath60 or other positive parity state , for example 6@xmath60 .",
    "the chosen values of @xmath59 vary in the interval @xmath61 .",
    "so , in our calculations there is a free parameter @xmath59 .",
    "however , this parameter is used to describe the rotational energies averaged over the parity and not the parity splitting studied in this paper .",
    "the method of the calculation of the inertia coefficient @xmath28 used in this paper is given in @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath28 is a smooth function of the mass number @xmath58 . as a consequence ,",
    "we take nearly the same value of @xmath28=20 @xmath62 @xmath63 for almost all considered actinide nuclei with a variation of 10@xmath51 . however , for @xmath64th and @xmath65ra we varied @xmath28 in the range @xmath28=(10 - 20)@xmath66 @xmath63 to obtain the correct value of @xmath67 .",
    "these variations of @xmath28 lead to better results for light ra isotopes than those in @xcite , where the obtained values of the parity splitting at the beginning of the alternating parity band are smaller than the experimental ones . using a smooth mass dependence of @xmath22",
    "@xcite we get @xmath22=4.5@xmath68 @xmath63 in the ba , ce and nd region .",
    "however , better results we obtain for @xmath22=3@xmath68 @xmath63 .    for very asymmetric dinuclear systems , we can use simple analytical expressions to establish a connection between the relative distance and mass asymmetry coordinates on one side and the multipole expansion coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath70 on the other side @xcite @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the spherical equivalent radius of the corresponding compound nucleus .",

    "then the mass parameters for @xmath70 and @xmath12-variables are related as @xmath76 if we take the value of @xmath77 mev@xmath78 known from the literature @xcite , then @xmath799.3 @xmath8010@xmath81 @xmath63 .",
    "this value is compatible with the one used in our calculations .",
    "solving the eigenvalue equation ( [ schr_eq ] ) , we obtain the wave functions of the positive and negative parity states for different values of the quantum number @xmath82 of angular momentum .",
    "these wave functions are used then to calculate transition matrix elements of the electric multipole operators by integration over @xmath12 .",
    "the electric multipole operators for a system of a dinuclear shape have been calculated @xcite by using the following expression @xmath83 for slightly overlapping clusters when the intercluster distance @xmath84 is about or larger than the sum of the radii of clusters @xmath85 , the nuclear charge density @xmath86 can be taken as a sum of the cluster charge densities @xmath87 using ( [ multipole2 ] ) and assuming axial symmetry of the nuclear shape , we obtain @xcite the following expressions for the intrinsic electric multipole moments @xmath88 where the charge quadrupole moments of clusters @xmath89 are calculated with respect to their centers of mass .",
    "effective charges for electric dipole and octupole transitions are used in our calculations in order to take the coupling of the mass  asymmetry mode to the higher  lying giant dipole and octupole excitations @xcite effectively into account , which are not present in the model .    the charge to mass ratios @xmath90 and @xmath91 are functions of @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath43=1 ( mononucleus ) this ratio takes the values 0.30.4 for the nuclei considered in the paper . for the @xmath19particle this ratio is equal to 0.5 .",
    "the results for the electric dipole moment are sensitive to the dependence of @xmath92/@xmath58 on @xmath12 . in the calculations we parameterize the @xmath93 ratio in the following way . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath91 for the light cluster takes the same value as for the mononucleus . for a smaller value of @xmath43",
    ", we set it equal to 0.5 as for the @xmath19cluster .",
    "as was mentioned in sect .",
    "ii.b , our consideration can be restricted to cluster configurations near @xmath43=1 .",
    "then it is convenient to substitute the coordinate @xmath12 by the following variable @xmath95 and to use the following smooth parameterization @xmath96 of the potential @xmath23 from eq .",

    "the largest deviations of the calculated values from the experimental ones are found at low spins in some of the considered nuclei .",
    "a good description of the experimental data , especially of the variation of the parity splitting with @xmath58 at low @xmath82 and of the value of the critical angular momentum at which the parity splitting disappears , means that the dependence of the potential energy on @xmath12 and @xmath82 for the considered nuclei is described correctly by the proposed cluster model .",
    "the used value of the inertia coefficient @xmath22 is also important .    of course , other effects related to degrees of freedom , which are not included in the model , like the alignment of the single particle momenta or interaction with other negative parity bands with different @xmath118 quantum number can contribute as well",
    "however , a general agreement between the experimental data and the results of calculations shows that the simple cluster model used in this paper gives a firm ground for the consideration of the alternating parity bands .",

    "this renormalization takes into account a coupling of the mass  asymmetry mode to the giant dipole resonance in a dinuclear system . in the case of the quadrupole transitions",
    "we did not renormalized the charge @xmath146 although an effective charge of 1.35 @xmath147 describes the data for actinides better as it is seen from the results of calculations . for octupole transitions",

    "the octupole transition operator is not exhausted by the term produced by the low  frequency octupole degree of freedom and includes also a contribution of the high  frequency octupole modes .",
    "for this reason for the octupole transitions the effect of the coupling of the low ",

    "the same is true for the reduced matrix elements of the electric quadrupole and octupole operators ( figs .",
    "5,6 and 8,9 ) .",
    "10 illustrates the angular momentum dependence of the calculated intrinsic transition quadrupole moment .",
    "it is interesting that the cluster model shows an increase of the quadrupole moment with angular momentum in the transitional nucleus @xmath122ra and a constant dependence in the well deformed isotope @xmath9u .",
    "staggering shown in fig .  10 for both @xmath122ra and @xmath9u nuclei",

    "this cluster configuration has larger quadrupole and octupole deformations .",
    "the calculated results for the e3reduced matrix elements in @xmath156nd exceed the experimental data for transitions to the ground band @xcite .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "the experimental e3 matrix elements connecting the negative parity states of @xmath156nd to the @xmath157 band are unexpectedly large , about 70@xmath51 of the matrix elements within the ground band @xcite .",
    "this shows a considerable fractionation of the e3 strength among the @xmath118=0 bands . in our model the @xmath157 degree of freedom",
    "is absent and all the e3 strength is concentrated in the transitions to the ground band . the nucleus @xmath156nd is transitional in its collective properties between spherical and deformed nuclei and the @xmath157 anharmonicity is quite large .",
    "this explains a fractionation of the e3 strength between the ground and the @xmath157 bands .",
    "the summed e3 strength for @xmath156nd corresponds to the intrinsic transitional octupole moment of @xmath158 @xmath159 ( instead of @xmath160 @xmath159 for the transitions in the ground band ) which agrees with the calculated value .",
    "we suggest a cluster interpretation of the properties of the alternating parity bands in heavy nuclei assuming collective oscillations in mass asymmetry degree of freedom .",
    "the existing experimental data on the angular momentum dependence of parity splitting and on multipole transition moments are quite well reproduced .",
    "this supports the idea that cluster type states exist in heavy nuclei .",
    "the characteristics of the hamiltonian used in the calculations were determined by investigating a completely different phenomenon , namely , heavy ion reactions at low energies . due to this fact , a predictive power of the suggested model is quite high . the proposed analytical expression ( [ spectr_eq ] ) for @xmath161",
    "can be applied to estimate the position of the low  lying states which are not yet measured .",
