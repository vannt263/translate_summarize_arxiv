    "a linear collider with both beams polarized will be an excellent tool not only to discover supersymmetric particles but also to determine the underlying susy model .",
    "associated neutralino production @xmath2 could be the first kinematically accessible process that may allow a discrimination between the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its nonminimal extensions .",
    "polarization of both beams will clearly facilitate this challenging task .",
    "an extensive analysis of polarization and spin effects in neutralino production and subsequent decay including the complete spin correlations in the mssm has been performed in @xcite .",
    "this study also includes extended susy models : the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) with an additional higgs singlet superfield and an @xmath1  inspired model with a higgs singlet and a new @xmath3 gauge boson .",
    "significant differences between the mssm and susy models with gauge singlets arise by the neutralino singlet components which do not couple to ( scalar ) fermions and standard gauge bosons . within a special scenario , where the masses of the light neutralinos were fixed in the three susy models and",
    "the lightest neutralino had a large singlino component in the extended models , the cross sections for neutralino production at an @xmath4 linear collider with polarized beams have been discussed in @xcite , and complete different polarization asymmetries have been found .",
    "now the study of the polarization effects is extended to a large region of the parameter space where the lightest neutralino is mainly a singlino . comparing the longitudinally polarized cross sections we identify the parameter regions where polarization effects may help to specify nonminimal supersymmetric models .",
    "of course for an exact determination of the susy parameters and discrimination between susy models a precise analysis also of the decay characteristics is indispensable . for a special scenario",
    "this was done in @xcite , the extension to the whole parameter space is planned .    in the following sections 2 and 3 we introduce the considered susy models and show the unpolarized cross section for the neutralino production .",
    "crucial for the understanding of the polarization effects are the couplings of the left and right selectrons to the produced neutralinos that will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "a comprehensive comparison of the longitudinally polarized cross sections in the mssm and the extended models in section 5 concludes our contribution .",
    "we shortly present the parameters and the neutralino sectors of the supersymmetric models . in the mssm the neutralino sector depends on the gaugino mass parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath8 and the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we assume the gut - relation @xmath10 and scan over the @xmath11-@xmath8 plane with fixed @xmath12 .",
    "the longitudinally polarized cross sections for neutralino production are compared with two extended susy models .",
    "the nmssm is the simplest extension of the mssm by a higgs singlet field with vacuum expectation value @xmath13 and hypercharge @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the masses and couplings of the five neutralinos depend on @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 and the trilinear couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the superpotential . within the nmssm ,",
    "a light singlino - like neutralino can not be experimentally excluded by lep @xcite . in order to obtain a light singlino - like neutralino @xmath18 we choose in the following @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 . then nearly independently of the other parameters the @xmath18 has singlino character and a mass between about 9 and 28 gev while the masses and mixings of the heavier neutralinos correspond to the mssm with @xmath21 .",
    "models with additional u(1 ) factors in the gauge group are a further extension of the mssm beyond the nmssm",
    ". they can be motivated by superstring theory @xcite and imply an @xmath1  group as effective gut group , which is broken to an effective low energy gauge group of rank 5 with one additional @xmath22 factor .",
    "this @xmath1  model contains one new gauge boson @xmath23 and an extended higgs sector with one singlet superfield with vacuum expectation value @xmath13 as in the nmssm @xcite . to respect the experimental mass bounds of new gauge bosons  @xcite the vacuum expectation value of the singlet",
    "must be larger than 1  tev .",
    "the extended neutralino sector in the @xmath1  model contains six neutralinos , one @xmath24 gaugino and one singlino @xmath25 in addition to the mssm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 neutralino mass matrix depends on six parameters : the @xmath27 , u(1)@xmath28 and @xmath22 gaugino mass parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath29 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 and the trilinear coupling @xmath16 in the superpotential . with the gut relation @xmath30 between the u(1 ) gaugino mass parameters the four lighter neutralinos always have mssm - like character if the mssm parameter @xmath8 is identified with @xmath31 @xcite , and the two heaviest neutralinos have large @xmath24 and @xmath25 components . assuming @xmath32 , however",
    ", the lightest neutralino can be a nearly pure singlino @xcite .",
    "then @xmath33 have mssm - like character and the @xmath34 has a mass @xmath35 .",
    "such scenarios where the spectrum of the lighter neutralinos is similar to the nmssm will be discussed in the following .",
    "table  [ scentab ] gives an overview over the described fixed parameters , while the remaining parameters @xmath6 and @xmath8 ( or @xmath31 ) were scanned in the region @xmath36 gev , @xmath37 gev observing the experimental bounds from the unsuccessful chargino and neutralino search at lep2 @xcite .",

    "in this section we address the question if a neutralino with a dominant singlino component can be directly produced with a sufficient cross section at a linear collider .",

    "note the discontinuities ( bold lines ) for both positive and negative @xmath8 where @xmath45 and therefore the mixing character of @xmath46 changes @xcite .    in the nmssm with a light singlino - dominated neutralino @xmath40 the unpolarized cross section ( fig .",
    "[ nmssm](a ) ) is significantly smaller since the singlino component does not couple to the @xmath47 boson and the selectrons .",
    "it is only the small contribution from the other components of @xmath18 that accounts for the cross section .",
    "nevertheless one gets even for a neutralino with a singlino component larger than 90% production cross sections up to 30  fb which are expected to be clearly visible at a high luminosity linear collider ( @xmath48fb ) @xcite .",
    "the use of polarized beams can still enhance these cross sections as we discuss in the following sections .    in the @xmath1  model we explicitly study the dependence of the unpolarized cross sections on the parameter @xmath29 in figs .",

    "polarization configurations with both beams polarized in the same direction or only one beam polarized are always smaller .",
    "the following remarks apply to all models : if the gaugino - character of @xmath40 and @xmath80 is not too small ( which is the case in the mssm for @xmath81 ) @xmath77 dominates if the gaugino - coupling of the left selectron is larger than that of the right one , @xmath82 , and the mass difference between the selectrons is rather small .",
    "analogously for @xmath83 , @xmath76 turns out to be the dominating cross section .",

    "@xcite .",
    "if the gaugino components of the produced neutralinos can be neglected , the ratio of the neutralino - selectron - electron couplings plays no role and the asymmetry in the mssm and nmssm @xmath85 depends only on the electron-@xmath47 couplings @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "so @xmath77 is generally largest in the mssm higgsino region @xmath88 , whereas in the nmssm the gaugino components of @xmath80 always cause @xmath89 for @xmath90 gev . in the @xmath1  model formula  ( [ asyhiggs ] ) becomes more complicated due to @xmath23 exchange .    because of @xmath91 in the nmssm and in the @xmath1  model with @xmath49 tev @xmath76 dominates in the whole parameter space . in the @xmath1  model with positive @xmath29 both cases @xmath72 and @xmath92 occur .",

    "the form of the respective parameter regions crucially depends on the value of @xmath29 ( compare figs .",
    "[ e6plus](b ) and [ e6plus35](b ) ) and is only approximately given by the contours @xmath93 because here the higgsino character of @xmath40 is always rather large .    in all models the cross sections for both beams polarized are more than two times larger than the unpolarized cross sections in a large fraction of the parameter space .",
    "to describe this fact we define the ratio @xmath94 in the mssm for @xmath75 ( gaugino - region ) one nearly always obtains @xmath95 or @xmath96 in the respective regions . in the nmssm and the @xmath1  model with negative @xmath29 it is always @xmath97 and even @xmath98 ( nmssm ) or @xmath99 ( @xmath1  model ) in a large fraction of parameter space . and",
    "also for positive @xmath29 @xmath100 or @xmath101 holds in large parameter regions .",
