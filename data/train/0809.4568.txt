    "electron correlation is important for electronic properties in wide variety of materials , where it causes drastic change in physical properties in strongly correlated electron systems with small change in electron / hole doping or an external field .",
    "standard electronic structure calculations are now based on the density - functional theory ( dft ) and have progressed greatly the understanding of electronic structures in condensed matters . the polarization function in dft",
    "is derived by the linear response theory of homogeneous / inhomogeneous electron gas , where the electron - electron correlation is calculated with the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) and effects of static screening are included .",
    "however , the results could not be free from self - interaction , especially in the local ( spin-)density approximation ( l(s)da ) .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , gw approximation ( gwa ) does not suffer from the problem of the self - interaction and can include effects of dynamical screening in the framework of many - body perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite moreover , one can estimate the screened coulomb interaction from the first principles . with a recent progress in computational algorithm and computer facilities",
    ", gwa can be applied now to realistic materials .",
    "gwa is the first term approximation of the many - body perturbation series and the self - energy is replaced by the lowest order term of the perturbation expansion .",
    "gwa for realistic condensed matters is formulated usually with the lsda hamiltonian as an unperturbed one without self - consistent calculation of the one - body green s function @xmath4 and the lsda exchange - correlation potential is subtracted later from the resultant gwa self - energy .",
    "the gwa self - energy is then given as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the unperturbed green s function .",
    "@xmath7 is the dynamically screened coulomb interaction with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bare coulomb interaction and @xmath10 is the lowest order irreducible polarization function @xmath11 .",
    "one possible way is that the quasi - particle energy is determined self - consistently in the lowest gwa equation with @xmath10 , which is called the  eigenvalue - only ( e - only ) self - consistency \" .",
    "@xcite in fact , the e - only self - consistent approach may be good enough if lsda would give reasonably good starting wave functions , though it may not be always the case .",
    "the self - consistent calculation of @xmath4 in gwa may be another approach , but that without the vertex correction leads to unphysical structure of spectra , e.g. , too wide band width and disappearance of plasmon satellite , and violation of the @xmath12-sum rule , though it ensures conservation of particle number and energy and then an accurate total energy .",
    "@xcite other trials of partially self - consistent treatment of gwa , named  the quasiparticle self - consistent \" gwa ,  @xcite have been proposed to improve the quasiparticle band structure .",
    "the essence of these methodologies is in how to obtain localized wave functions in transition - metal oxides",
    ".    another possibility would be the establishment of a methodology to start with some unperturbed hamiltonian which gives localized wave functions or correct eigen - energies . in the present work ,",
    "we propose a methodology of gwa , starting with wave functions of the lsda+u method ,  @xcite in order to have localized wave functions and apply it to several transition - metal oxides , mno , nio and v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "[ u+gwa ] , the present methodology , named u+gwa , is explained briefly .",
    "section [ nio - mno ] is devoted to the application to antiferromagnetic insulators ( afi ) mno and nio .",
    "two systems are very typical : the electronic structure of mno can be obtained by gwa and , on the contrary , that of nio by u+gwa .",
    "the physical reason for this choice is discussed .",
    "the method of unique choice of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath13 is analyzed in details .",
    "we show that the starting wave functions by lsda are satisfactory in mno and are largely improved in nio by lsda+u with a proper value of @xmath13 .",
    "the present u+gwa is then applied to afi v@xmath0o@xmath1 in sec .",
    "summary and conclusion are given in sec .",
    "[ u+gwa ]      we will present here a theoretical method of gwa with wave functions obtained by the lsda+u method ,  @xcite and we apply this method to nio , mno , and v@xmath0o@xmath1 in the proceeding sections .",
    "present calculation is based on the linear muffin - tin orbital method with the atomic sphere approximation ( lmto - asa ) ( ref .  ) and also the lsda+u method with coulomb interactions of rotational invariance .",
    "@xcite the lsda+u method has shown a reasonable success for many d- and f - electron systems in the broad feature of electronic structure .",
    "since the lsda+u method is a kind of the static limit of gwa , it could be a good starting approximation of gwa .",
    "@xcite the energy gap becomes larger in lsda+u and the polarization becomes smaller because of the energy denominator in the rpa polarization function .",
    "moreover , wave functions of the lsda+u method are more localized than those by lsda because of strong on - site coulomb interaction and , therefore , can be more preferable for materials with strong electron - electron correlation .",
    "once we start from the lsda+u hamiltonian , the exchange - correlation potential and the hubbard terms of coulomb interaction should be subtracted from the gwa self - energy as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the exchange - correlation potential and @xmath16 is the potential correction derived from the hubbard term in the lsda+u method .",
    "@xcite this we call lsda+u+gwa or u+gwa . in the present formulation , once we set @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the last term in eq .",

    "the choice of @xmath13 will be discussed further in sec .",
    "[ choice_of_u ] .",
    "our criterion for the value @xmath13 in u+gwa is that the off - diagonal elements of the self - energy become negligibly small , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ legitimacy ] . the exchange interaction @xmath24",
    "is set to be the value of the constrained lsda calculation .",

    "the number of product bases used in @xmath28 is reduced from 10,728 to 1,584 .",
    "the two crystal structures , monoclinic and corundum structures , do not cause any significant difference in the electronic structures in lsda and lsda+u calculations for both paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "then , we use the corundum structure throughout the present work .",
    "the gwa results of v@xmath0o@xmath1 , starting from lsda , give rise to a metallic antiferromagnetic ground state , completely different from the experimental situation .",
    "both in lsda and in lsda+u , the d - bands of majority spin are partially filled and those of minority spin are empty . though the screening effects in gwa must be large , the polarization function is too large due to small energy denominator , similarly to nio .",
    "therefore , we start calculations with lsda+u to prepare improved wave functions and polarization function and adopt u+gwa with the e - only self - consistency .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath24 are set as 2.6  ev and 0.9  ev , respectively .",

    "the valence band just below the fermi energy is mostly of e@xmath34 with small mixing of a@xmath35 orbitals and the lowest conduction band is of a@xmath35 character .",
    "the ground - state configuration is , then , e@xmath37e@xmath37 of majority spins @xmath38 and the e@xmath39 band of minority spin @xmath40 locates at higher energies by about @xmath41  ev . the unoccupied a@xmath35 band of majority spin is lifted up at the midway between majority- and minority - spin e@xmath34 bands . with an assumption of vanishing hybridization gap ,",

    "this result of the energy difference is in good agreement with the calculated one of about 1.5@xmath472  ev .",
    "we should note that the gap between majority - spin e@xmath34 and minority - spin e@xmath34 band is not the hund splitting , but is given by the difference in the coulomb interaction ( the coulomb gap ) ; @xmath48 which can nicely explain the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : greenfn - v2o3 ] .",
    "the position of the minority spin a@xmath35 band locates below that of the minority spin e@xmath34 band which is estimated as @xmath49    the observed v 3d spectrum in paramagnetic metallic phase shows a two - peak structure .",
    "@xcite the prominent peak at @xmath50 of the width of 0.5  ev in metallic phase disappears in insulator phase , corresponding to opening the gap , and the broader peak with a width of 2  ev does not change much among antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic insulator phases .",
    "the observed v d - bands in insulator phases are the lower hubbard band and may correspond to the occupied u+gwa bands .",
    "but the present calculated one has a significantly narrower width of about 0.7  ev .",
    "in fact , the t@xmath35 single - electron level locates at @xmath51 below the lowest @xmath52 level and would appear between the calculated e@xmath53e@xmath53 and o 2p - bands .",
    "therefore , we believe that the observed broad occupied v d - bands originate from the mixture of e@xmath53e@xmath53 and e@xmath34 states . the screened coulomb interaction can be calculated in gwa and u+gwa .",
    "exchange interactions in v@xmath0o@xmath1 can be calculated also in the framework of lsda+u and @xmath54 ( ferromagnetic ) , @xmath55 ( antiferromagnetic ) and @xmath56 ( ferromagnetic ) for the first , second and third nearest neighbor pairs , which are consistent with observed spin alignment .",
    "the spin magnetic moment is evaluated to be 1.9  @xmath57 .",
    "the vanadium trivalent ion is a system with electrons less than half and , therefore , the spin - orbit interaction is negative .",
    "the resultant orbital contribution to the magnetic moment should be negative .",
    "this is also consistent with experimental observations of the total magnetic moment .      in the paramagnetic case ,",
    "the electronic structure calculated by lda+u method is quite different from that in antiferromagnetic case , e.g. , metallic and large bonding - antibonding splitting of a@xmath35 orbital which causes the majority configuration to be a@xmath35e@xmath34 . with a larger value of @xmath13",
    ", the a@xmath35 band can move to higher energy region but , even if @xmath58  ev , the a@xmath35 band overlaps still with occupied e@xmath34 band .    the total electron - electron interaction energy can be evaluated as @xmath59 in the case of paramagnetic metallic configuration @xmath60 where we assume that two - electrons occupy the non - degenerate a@xmath35 and doubly degenerate e@xmath34 bands with spin degeneracy without the hubbard gap .",
    "similarly we can get the energy @xmath61 in the case of paramagnetic metallic configuration @xmath62 , assuming that the a@xmath35 band is lifted up and is left empty . on the contrary , if we have the hubbard gap of e@xmath34 bands and a@xmath35 band is empty , then we have a paramagnetic insulator configuration e@xmath63e@xmath64 and the total electron - electron interaction energy can be estimated as @xmath65 .",
    "we can compare the energies of two configurations where two electrons occupy e@xmath34 orbitals , the energy difference is @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the latter configuration @xmath67 should be realized .",
    "however , the gwa and u+gwa could not create the hubbard gap in paramagnetic phase and does not give a realistic feature of electronic structure in paramagnetic phase , both insulating and metallic phases .",
    "this is a possible explanation consistent with lda+dmft .",
    "@xcite in the antiferromagnetic case , the situation changes very easily because the spin polarization can open the coulomb gap as we have seen",
    ". then the crystal field splitting makes the a@xmath35 band appears in the insulating gap .",
    "in summary , we proposed gwa method starting from the lsda+u calculation , named u+gwa , with energy - only self - consistent calculation .",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction parameter is determined so that the off - diagonal elements of the self - energy become small and we start gwa with more localized wave functions or a wider band gap .",
