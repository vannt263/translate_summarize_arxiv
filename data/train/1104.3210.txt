    "liouville theory plays a pivotal role in several fields both at the classical @xcite and quantum level @xcite .",
    "liouville action provides the faddeev - popov determinant in two dimensional gravity @xcite and it gives the complete hamiltonian structure of @xmath1-dimensional gravity coupled with particles @xcite .",
    "it appears also in the soliton solutions to the gauged non linear schroedinger equation on the plane @xcite .",
    "liouville field has been suggested to play the role of a fifth dimension in the ads - cft treatment of qcd @xcite .",
    "recently a renewed interest has developed due to a conjecture @xcite that liouville theory on a riemann surface of genus @xmath2 is related to a certain class of @xmath3 , @xmath4-dimensional gauge theories and the conjecture has been supported by extensive tests on genus @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite and proven in a class of cases @xcite .    in the topology of the sphere important results regarding the four point conformal correlation functions have been obtained in @xcite and their relation to the one point function on the torus suggested in @xcite and proven in @xcite .",
    "we recall that the classical solution provides the starting point for the semiclassical expansion and that such semiclassical expansion was used to confirm the first few terms of the bootstrap solution on the sphere , pseudosphere and disk topologies and also to give some results on higher point functions when one source is weak @xcite .",
    "the simplest situation is given by the topology of the sphere for which many results are available both at the classical and quantum level .",
    "the torus topology is intrinsically more complicated that the sphere .",
    "for example the one point function on the torus appears to be of comparable complexity as the four point function on the sphere @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite liouville theory on the torus was examined in the simpler situation in which the distribution of charges is invariant under reflection @xmath7 .",
    "as the map given by the weierstrass function @xmath8 is invariant under reflection it turns out that one can map the problem on the riemann sphere , where well developed techniques exist along with several results . in the symmetric situation , periodicity , which is the fundamental constraint ,",
    "is obtained by imposing monodromicity in @xmath9 .",
    "in fact monodromic behavior in @xmath9 at the singular points points @xmath10 ( see @xcite and section [ thetorus ] of the present paper ) combined with reflection symmetry is equivalent to the periodicity constraint along the non collapsible cycles which in the general case is much more difficult requirement to implement .    in @xcite the exact solution for the one point function on the square",
    "was given and several problems which can be dealt with perturbation technique solved .",
    "in the present paper we deal with the problem in full generality i.e. when the distribution of charges is not necessarily invariant under reflections ; to do this the shall need the full description of the torus as a double sheet cut - plane and we shall need the notion @xcite of differential equation on a riemann surface . as discussed in @xcite the differential equation which solves the liouville equation in the case of the torus contains even in the simplest case of the one point function a parameter , the heun parameter which does not appear in the case of the sphere topology with three sources .",
    "such parameter , along with an other weight parameter has to be determined by imposing monodromicity on the two sheet cut plane or equivalently by imposing the periodic boundary conditions . in the case of the square and of the rhombus with opening angle @xmath0",
    "such parameter turns out to be zero and the problem is reduced to an hypergeometric equation ( see appendix b ) ; on the other hand the exact non perturbative determination of the heun parameter in the general case to our knowledge in not an accomplished task @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section [ general ] we display the mathematical framework of the formulation of differential equations on a riemann surface .    in section [ thetorus ]",
    "we show with a group theory argument how the heun parameter along with the weight parameter @xmath11 give the necessary and sufficient degrees of freedom to satisfy all the monodromy requirements .",
    "then in section [ additionweak ] we solve the problem of the addition of a small charge when the solution for a single ( non necessarily small ) charge is given , as it is the case of the square and of the rhombus with opening angle @xmath0 .",
    "the treatment however is completely general .    as a by product we obtain is section [ greenfunction ] the expression by quadratures of the exact green function on the background generated by an arbitrary charge .",
    "the expression holds also for the general torus ; the only difference is that while for the square and the rhombus of opening angle @xmath0 we know the expression of the unperturbed solution , for the generic torus such unperturbed solutions are not known in terms of usual functions .    in order to display the workings of the technique discussed in sections [ general ] and [ thetorus ] , in appendix",
    "a we give the perturbative determination of the conformal factor for a weak source in the general case i.e. when the source is not symmetric wrt to the position of the kinematical singularities @xmath12 which arise in the transition from the global covering variable to the coordinates @xmath13 which provide a one - to - one description of the torus .    in appendix b for completeness",
    "we report the solution for the square given in @xcite and we also add the solution in terms of hypergeometric functions for the rhombus of opening angle @xmath0 .",
    "the deformation technique developed in @xcite can be applied to both of these cases .",
    "we give here the elements of the theory of differential equations on a riemann surface . for more details see e.g. @xcite . a surface with the topology of the sphere",
    "can be mapped on the compactified plane where the usual theory of linear differential equations apply ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to extend the concept of differential equation to a riemann surface",
    "it is useful to rewrite the second order differential equation @xmath14 in the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17    and we have denoted in eq.([secondorderde ] ) by a prime the differentiation wrt @xmath18 . for",
    "well known topological reasons when the manifold has genus @xmath6 or higher we have no global coordinate at our disposal and thus we must use more than one chart with analytic transition functions .    it is useful to consider @xmath19 as a differential of the fractionary order @xmath20 , i.e. in the change from the variable @xmath18 to the variable @xmath21 we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 one easily finds , denoting with a dot the derivative wrt @xmath21 @xmath24 and @xmath25 obeys @xmath26 the usual transformation of a connection gives @xmath27 with @xmath28 the term @xmath29 is the schwarzian derivative of the transformation @xmath30 it is of interest to notice that the assumed nature ( [ minusonehalfdiff ] ) of the solutions @xmath19 of eq.([secondorderde ] ) , which leaves the wronskian of two solutions unchanged , makes the well known expression @xcite for the conformal factor in terms of two independent solutions of the differential equation ( [ secondorderde ] ) @xmath31 ^ 2}\\ ] ] a differential of order @xmath32 as required for an area element @xmath33 one can extend the concept of fuchsian differential equation to differential equations on a riemann surface provided the term @xmath34 or better the @xmath35 component of the connection @xmath36 is a meromorphic function on the riemann surface i.e. @xcite the ratio of two polynomials of the same order in the homogeneous coordinates describing the surface .",
    "the torus is described by the cubic curve in euclidean coordinates @xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38 or in homogeneous coordinates @xmath39    to the liouville equation @xmath40 there corresponds the differential equation in @xmath9 given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 a meromorphic function on the torus with second order poles at @xmath10 due to the presence of the schwarz derivative in ( [ gammatransform ] ) and a second order pole at @xmath43 @xmath44\\frac{1}{w }   + \\frac{\\beta_t(w+w_t)}{2(u - t)w}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\beta_1}{2(u - e_1)}+\\frac{\\beta_2}{2(u - e_2)}+\\frac{\\beta_3}{2(u - e_3)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath45 appearing in the residue of the double pole at @xmath43 is given by @xmath46 . due to the factor",
    "@xmath47 the pole is present only on the first sheet .",
    "the term @xmath48 is necessary to assure that @xmath49 does not show an irregular singularity at infinity .",
    "the @xmath50 are the accessory parameters",
    ". the above structure can be trivially generalized to any finite number of sources .",
    "obviously we could place the source at @xmath51 simplifying the structure of @xmath49 as was done in @xcite but in the perspective of the general non symmetric situation ( see e.g. section [ additionweak ] ) we work here in full generality .",
    "the first two lines in the expression of @xmath49 is simply the contribution of the schwarzian derivative for the transition from the covering variable @xmath52 to the variable @xmath9 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath49 in the local covering variable at infinity @xmath53 , with @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 regularity of @xmath56 at @xmath57 i.e. absence of charges at @xmath58 implies @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 and thus at the end we have one free accessory parameter , say @xmath62 which has to be used to satisfy the monodromies at @xmath63 and along the two fundamental non contractible cycles .",
    "we want to show at the non perturbative level how one free accessory parameter is sufficient for the purpose .",
    "let @xmath64 and @xmath65 be two independent solutions of @xmath66 of wronskian @xmath67 .",
    "we must find combinations @xmath68 such that @xmath69 type , which corresponds to six real degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition we notice that the monodromy of ( [ standardform ] ) is unchanged under an @xmath70 transformation which corresponds to three real degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the @xmath71 provide effectively only three real degrees of freedom to which we have to add the real and imaginary part of @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath72 real degrees of freedom .",
    "we shall have to satisfy the monodromy condition at all singularities @xmath63 , @xmath73 and along the two fundamental non contractible cycles @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath70 nature of the transformation @xmath77 .",
    "finally we use the remaining two real degrees of freedom ( the real and imaginary part of @xmath62 ) to impose @xmath78        this is not enough to give the @xmath70 nature of the transformation @xmath79 .",
    "however from the contour shown in fig.1 , obtained by deforming a loop around @xmath80 , the following relation holds @xmath81 being @xmath82 the elliptic transformation around @xmath80 .",
    "the reason is that the monodromy transformations around each of the singular points @xmath83 and @xmath58 is simply @xmath84 , because the indices at those points are @xmath85 in @xmath86 and @xmath87 at @xmath88 and a turn in the local covering variable corresponds to a double turn in @xmath86 and in @xmath9 at infinity .",
    "now the following simple theorem holds : if in eq.([nonpertcycle ] ) @xmath89 and eq.([offdiagonal2 ] ) is satisfied and @xmath82 is elliptic , then @xmath90 and as a consequence also @xmath91 .",
    "in fact after eqs.([mc1],[offdiagonal2 ] ) are satisfied the matrices @xmath77 and @xmath79 take the form @xmath92 @xmath93    the positive number @xmath94 is fixed by the elliptic nature of the product ( [ nonpertcycle ] ) i.e. @xmath95 with @xmath96 eq.([traceconstraint ] ) has the discrete solution @xmath97 . in general @xmath98",
    "is not the only solution of eq.([traceconstraint ] ) .",
    "the results of picard @xcite which apply also to topologies other than the sphere , assure us that the values of the free parameters which realizes the monodromy are unique and thus @xmath97 is the only solution which realizes all the monodromies . in the next section",
    "we shall apply a perturbative version of this theorem to the addition of weak sources .",
    "in the present section we shall apply perturbation theory to give in terms of quadratures the two point conformal factor when one source is arbitrary and the second small .",
    "a similar problem was solved in @xcite in the simpler situation of the perturbation provided by two weak symmetrical sources and which could be treated with methods of the sphere topology . here",
    "instead being the situation non symmetrical we have to exploit in full the two sheet representation of the torus given by the cubic ( [ cubic ] ) .",
    "we shall keep the treatment at full generality ; we recall that in two instances ( the square , and the rhombus of opening angle @xmath0 as given in appendix b ) the exact solution is known and thus we shall for a perturbation of these situations have a solution in terms of quadratures .",
    "the same formulas apply starting from the general non perturbative one point function with the difference that in this case the unperturbed functions are given by the solution of the heun equation , at a special value of the heun parameter for which we do not possess an explicit formula .",
    "the equation to be solved is @xmath99 where @xmath49 , describing a source of arbitrary strength at the origin @xmath58 i.e. @xmath88 , is given by @xcite @xmath100 with the non perturbative heun parameter @xmath101 fixed to the value which provides the monodromic one point solution on the torus .",
    "we know the exact value of such a parameter only for the special cases of the square and the rhombus with opening angle @xmath0 where @xmath102 for symmetry reasons .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath103 and @xmath104 the two unperturbed solutions , with real wronskian @xmath67 , which realize the monodromic conformal factor @xmath105 ^ 2}~.\\ ] ] the perturbation @xmath34 is given by @xmath106\\frac{1}{w } + \\frac{\\beta_t(w+w_t)}{2(u - t)w}+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\beta_1}{2(u - e_1)}+\\frac{\\beta_2}{2(u - e_2)}+\\frac{\\beta_3}{2(u - e_3)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it describes the additional weak source at @xmath63 .",
    "we had to allow in ( [ smallq ] ) for a new accessory parameter @xmath107 at @xmath108 and the @xmath109 are the @xmath110 changes of the accessory parameters at @xmath111 of eq.([qterm ] ) .",
    "again they are subject to two fuchs relations which are imposed by the condition that the behavior of @xmath112 at @xmath88 remains unchanged , i.e. the source at the origin @xmath58 ( @xmath88 ) remains unchanged .",
    "they are @xmath59 @xmath113 the analogue of eq.([thirdfuchs ] ) here is absent as now the origin is a singular regular point .",
    "thus we are left with two free accessory parameters , say @xmath107 and @xmath62 .",
    "the perturbed solutions are given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 with @xmath116 and the @xmath110 constants @xmath117 correspond to the addition of the unperturbed solutions and they satisfy @xmath118 to leave the wronskian unchanged . as we have already discussed in section [ thetorus ] if one factors the @xmath70 transformations the @xmath117 provide only three real degrees of freedom .",
    "we shall first examine the monodromy at the new singularity @xmath63 .",
    "taking into account that the integrands of @xmath119 contain a first and second order pole at @xmath108 whose residues are @xmath120 we have that the change of such integrals under a tour around @xmath63 is @xmath121 the monodromy matrix of @xmath122 and @xmath123 at @xmath63 is given by @xmath124 monodromy at @xmath63 requires @xmath125 it is worth noticing that the @xmath107 is fixed independently of all the other parameters .",
    "as the transformation at @xmath63 is elliptic i.e. @xmath126 real , the condition ( [ tcondition ] ) is sufficient to assure that the transformation belongs to @xmath70 . on the other hand @xmath127",
    "can be explicitly proven using the expression of @xmath128 as follows .",
    "eq.([tcondition ] ) tells us that @xmath129 which , being @xmath126 and @xmath67 real gives @xmath130 i.e. @xmath127 .",
    "we add now a remark which will be essential in the following development . if we consider a contour @xmath131 , see fig.2 , which embraces both the origin and the weak singularity at @xmath63 the resulting monodromy is elliptic .",
    "more precisely the product of the perturbation @xmath132 of the original unperturbed elliptic transformation @xmath133 at @xmath58 and the @xmath70 monodromy near the identity at @xmath134 is elliptic .",
    "in fact @xmath135 is still elliptic because the source at the origin is unchanged and ellipticity tells us that @xmath136 and the elliptic @xmath70 monodromy @xmath137 near the identity can be written as @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 all of order @xmath110 .",
    "their product @xmath143 has the diagonal elements @xmath144 with trace real and by continuity , of modulus less than 2 .",
    "thus @xmath145 is elliptic .",
    "we can now deform the contour @xmath131 which embraces the origin @xmath58 and @xmath80 as shown in fig.2 .",
    "around the singular points @xmath73 we have @xmath146 due to the cancellation of the @xmath147 contributions given by the integrals @xmath119 . in the local covering variable @xmath148",
    "we have @xmath149 so that for a tour around the singularity i.e. @xmath150 we have @xmath151 and @xmath152 and thus the monodromy matrices at @xmath12 are all @xmath84 .",
    "thus we have @xmath153 we can now repeat the argument given in section [ thetorus ] to conclude that the imposition of the @xmath70 nature of @xmath154 and the relation @xmath155 is sufficient to assure the @xmath70 nature of transformations @xmath156 . as a consequence @xmath157 and",
    "being already @xmath158 we have also @xmath159 .",
    "we come now to the determination of the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath117 . the perturbed @xmath161 is @xmath162 with @xmath163 we denote with @xmath25 and @xmath164 the solutions computed at the same point on the torus but reached through a cycle @xmath165 @xmath166 we have for the unperturbed problem @xmath167 and for the perturbed one @xmath168 with @xmath169 we have @xmath170 and thus @xmath171 giving the constancy of @xmath172 .",
    "writing @xmath173 , for the cycle @xmath74 the relation @xmath174 gives @xmath175",
    "the @xmath176 are of the form @xmath177 @xmath178 we see that only the combinations @xmath179 appear in such relation .",
    "this , as discussed in section [ thetorus ] , is due to the remnant @xmath70 invariance of the monodromy conditions .",
    "thus the previous is a system of two linear non homogeneous equation in @xmath141 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , @xmath183 .",
    "the condition @xmath184 gives @xmath185 explicitely @xmath186=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is one inhomogeneous linear equation .    to this",
    "we must add the relation @xmath187 which reads @xmath188 which is an other system of two linear inhomogeneous equations .",
    "the equality of the real parts of ( [ rec111 ] ) and ( [ rec112 ] ) and the vanishing of the imaginary part of ( [ rec111 ] ) and ( [ rec112 ] ) and ( [ modulus1 ] ) provide a linear inhomogeneous system of four equations in the unknown @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",
    "the outcome substituted into ( [ rec111 ] ) provides @xmath141 .",
    "taking the derivative wrt @xmath126 of the equation @xmath189 satisfied by the @xmath190 we computed in the previous section we obtain the exact green function on the one - point background .",
    "in fact we have @xmath191 @xmath192 can be simply computed by taking the derivative of @xmath193 obtained in the previous section from @xmath122 and @xmath123 , as the logarithm of the jacobian appearing in the transition from @xmath190 to @xmath193 does not depend on @xmath126 .",

    "in this paper we have extended the treatment of a previous paper @xcite to the general case in which the distribution of charges is not symmetric under reflections with respect to the origin . in this case",
    "one has to apply the concept of differential equation on a riemann surface and in particular the concept of fuchsian differential equation on a riemann surface . as in @xcite new accessory parameters",
    "appear which have to be fixed by imposing the monodromic behavior of the solution .",
    "this is a more difficult task than in the symmetric case where sphere topology techniques could be applied .",
    "we gave a general group theoretic argument to prove that the heun parameter and the weight factor are sufficient to satisfy all the monodromies . to give a concrete illustration of the procedure , in appendix a we work out explicitely a perturbative case .",
    "then in section [ additionweak ] we deal with the problem of the addition of a weak source to the solution of the one point function .",
    "the procedure is completely general even if we know the explicit form of the solution only in the cases of the square and of the rhombus of opening angle @xmath0 which are reported in appendix b. this is due to the fact that in these cases for symmetry reasons the heun parameter @xmath101 vanishes . as a byproduct",
    "we also obtain the exact expression in terms of quadratures of the green function on the background of one source of arbitrary strength .",
    "the results can be used to develop the quantum semiclassical expansion as done for the pseudosphere , sphere and disk topologies in @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we summarize the general perturbative treatment of the one point function on the torus when the source is not symmetrical with respect to the kinematical singularities @xmath10 and which requires explicitely the two sheet representation of the torus .",

    "<S> we extend the previous treatment of liouville theory on the torus , to the general case in which the distribution of charges is not necessarily symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the concept of fuchsian differential equation on riemann surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we show through a group theoretic argument that the heun parameter and a weight constant are sufficient to satisfy all monodromy conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply the technique of differential equation on a riemann surface to the two point function on the torus in which one source is arbitrary and the other small . as a byproduct we give in terms of quadratures the exact green function on the square and on the rhombus with opening angle @xmath0 in the background of the field generated by an arbitrary charge .    </S>",
