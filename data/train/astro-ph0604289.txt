    "galaxy clusters are unique , high - density regions in the universe and are therefore important testbeds for theories of galaxy formation and evolution . within the last decade , significant amounts of observational resources have been invested in finding clusters to @xmath11 1 using x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite techniques .",
    "simultaneously , surveys which employ the lyman - break technique have begun to uncover a population of vigorously star - forming proto - cluster regions at @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "tantalizingly , the crucial stages in cluster galaxy evolution , where star - forming lyman-@xmath13 galaxies transform into the quiescent early - type population seen at @xmath11 1 @xcite appear to occur in the hard to access redshift range @xmath0 , the `` cluster desert '' .",
    "currently , there are fewer than 15 spectroscopically - confirmed clusters at @xmath6 ( with the highest - redshift being @xmath14 ; @xcite )",
    "the cluster red - sequence ( crs ) technique requires imaging in only two filters which span the @xmath15 break feature in early types , and is a well - tested and observationally efficient method for detecting clusters @xcite .",
    "the crs algorithm selects clusters by using the fact that the cluster galaxy population is dominated by ellipticals and that they lie along a linear relation in the color - magnitude plane .",
    "if two filters that span the rest - frame @xmath15 break are used to construct the color - magnitude diagram , cluster ellipticals are always the brightest , reddest galaxies at a given redshift , and therefore provide significant contrast with the field .",
    "the original technique was first developed by gladders & yee and is being used very successfully to target clusters in the @xmath16 range where the blue - red @xmath17 filter combination spans the @xmath15 break .",
    "1 shows the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an early type at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "also shown are the portions of the sed sampled by the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and [ 3.6 ] passbands . at @xmath24 ,",
    "the 4000 - break is shifted into the infrared ( ir ) . to carry out a cluster survey at @xmath6 requires deep ir observations over a large area - observations that are very difficult to obtain from the ground .",
    "the only deep , large area ( tens of square degrees ) ir dataset currently available ( or indeed available for the foreseeable future ) is the spitzer swire legacy survey .",
    "the swire survey is comprised of six fields , and is well - suited to searching for high redshift clusters . four fields ( 34.2 deg@xmath3 ) are accessible from the north , and two fields ( 14.8 deg@xmath3 ) from the south ( totalling 49 deg@xmath3 ) .",
    "rich clusters are very rare so it is important to search over as large an area as possible .",
    "we expect to find only about 30 _ rich _ clusters ( abell class 1 ) in the _ entire _ swire survey .    our collaboration , sparcs ( the _ _ sp__itzer _ _ a__daptation of the _ _ r__ed - sequence _ _",
    "c__luster _ _ s__urvey ) has developed an ir adaptation of the two - filter cluster red - sequence technique which utilizes irac s @xmath4 channel as the `` red '' filter @xcite .",
    "a good choice of `` blue '' filter ( better than e.g. , @xmath25 or @xmath21 ) , is the @xmath22 filter .",
    "this is because @xmath22 samples blueward of rest - frame @xmath15 at @xmath26 , and yet becomes only as blue as rest - frame @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "2 shows red - sequence models constructed using the code of @xcite , assuming a galaxy undergoing a burst of star - formation at @xmath29 and evolving passively thereafter .",
    "based on these models , we can detect @xmath30  early types to @xmath31 .    to date",
    ", we have combined 6 deg@xmath3 of megacam @xmath1 and swire [ 3.6 ] data in the xmm - lss field , and detected about 70 moderately - rich clusters at @xmath32 .",
    "3  &  4 show examples of clusters at @xmath33 . we are currently extending this analysis to the remaining swire fields .",
    "by searching for clusters over 50 deg@xmath3 , our aim is to detect a _ representative _ sample of clusters at @xmath34",
    ". this will allow the study of cluster galaxy evolution over a range of cluster richnesses and redshifts .",
    "we plan to measure the ir luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the mid - ir dust - obscured star - formation rate ( using the swire @xmath35 data ) , the red - sequence , and the relative color distribution . in particular , the evolution of the color distribution will allow us to study the star - formation properties of the cluster galaxies as a function of mass and redshift and understand how the star - forming proto - cluster regions at @xmath36 connect to the quiescent clusters at @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , by measuring the evolution of both the ir luminosity function and the slope , scatter and color of the red - sequence to higher redshift than previous studies , we hope to put precise constraints on the epoch when stellar mass is assembled in cluster galaxies @xcite .    our goal is to release our cluster catalogs to the community as soon as possible , so that this sample can serve as a basis for numerous other science projects which require follow - up observations ( e.g. mass determination , enrichment history ) .",
    "this work is based in part on archival data obtained with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa .",
    "this work was also based on observations obtained with megaprime / megacam , a joint project of cfht and cea / dapnia , at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the national research council ( nrc ) of canada , the institut national des science de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) of france , and the university of hawaii .",
    "this work is based in part on data products produced at terapix and the canadian astronomy data centre as part of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey , a collaborative project of nrc and cnrs .",
