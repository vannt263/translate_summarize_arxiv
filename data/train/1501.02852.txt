    "the entanglement entropy , as a tool to detect and classify quantum phase transitions , has been playing an important role in the last fifteen years ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in one dimension , where most of the critical quantum chains are conformal invariant , the entanglement entropy provides a powerful tool to detect , as well to calculate , the central charge @xmath11 of the underlying cft .",
    "for example , for quantum chains , the ground - state entanglement entropy of a subsystem formed by contiguous @xmath7 sites of an infinite system , with respect to the complementary subsystem has the leading behavior @xmath12 if the system is critical or @xmath13 , when the system is noncritical with correlation length @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "although there are plenty of proposals to measure this quantity in the lab @xcite the actual experiments were out of reach so far . strictly speaking",
    "the central charge of quantum spin chains has never been measured experimentally .",
    "recently other quantities , that are also dependent of the central charge has been proposed @xcite . among these proposals interesting measures that , from the numerical point of view , are also efficient in detecting the phase transitions as well as the universality class of critical behavior , are the shannon and rnyi mutual informations @xcite ( see also the related works @xcite ) .",
    "the rnyi mutual information ( the exact definition will be given in the next section ) has a parameter @xmath5 that recovers the shannon mutual information at the value @xmath15 .",
    "the results derived in @xcite indicate that the shannon and rnyi mutual informations of the ground state of quantum spin chains , when expressed in some special local basis , similarly as happens with the shannon and rnyi entanglement entropy , show a logarithmic behavior with the subsystem s size whose coefficient depends on the central charge .",
    "recently additional new results concerning the shannon and rnyi mutual information in quantum systems were obtained , see @xcite .",
    "there are also studies of the mutual information in classical two dimensional spin systems @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the shannon and rnyi mutual informations studied in the above papers , as will be defined in the next section , are basis dependent quantities .",
    "it is important to distinguish them from the more known basis independent quantity , namely , the von neumann mutual information . for recent developments on the calculation of the von neumann mutual information in thermal equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems",
    "see @xcite .",
    "most of the results regarding the shannon and the rnyi mutual information , except for the case of harmonic chains , are based on numerical analysis , especially for systems with central charge not equal to one .",
    "one of the main problems in a possible analytical derivation comes from the presence of a discontinuity at @xmath15 of the rnyi mutual information .",
    "this discontinuity prevents the use of the replica trick , which is normally a necessary step for the analytical derivation of the shannon mutual information .    in this paper",
    "we will consider , for many different quantum chains , another version of the mutual information , which is also parametrized by a parameter @xmath5 that reduces at @xmath15 to the shannon mutual information .",
    "the motivation for our calculations is two fold .",
    "firstly this definition is more appropriate from the point of view of a measure of shared information among parts of a system , since it has the expected properties .",
    "this will be discussed in the appendix .",
    "secondly , this quantity does not show any discontinuity at @xmath15 , so it might be a good starting point for the analytical calculation of the shannon mutual information with some sort of analytical continuation of the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "from now on we will call this new quantity generalized mutual information .    having the above motivations in mind we firstly calculated numerically ( using exact diagonalization ) the generalized mutual information for several critical quantum spin chains .",
    "we considered models with @xmath1 symmetries like the @xmath16-state potts modes for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the z(4 ) ashkin - teller model and the @xmath1 parafermionic models with @xmath19 .",
    "we then calculated the generalized mutual information for quantum critical harmonic chains ( discrete version of klein - gordon field theory ) and also for quantum spin chains with @xmath4 symmetry like the xxz and the spin-1 fateev - zamolodchikov quantum chains .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we will present the essential definitions of the shannon and rnyi mutual informations as well as generalized mutual information . in section three",
    "we will present the numerical results of the generalized mutual information for many different critical quantum spin chains .",
    "finally in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "consider the normalized ground state eigenfunction of a quantum spin chain hamiltonian @xmath20 , expressed in a particular local basis @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the eigenvalues of some local operators defined on the lattice sites .",
    "the rnyi entropy is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the probability of finding the system in the particular configuration given by @xmath25 .",
    "the limit @xmath26 gives us the shannon entropy @xmath27 .",
    "since we are considering only local basis it is always possible to decompose the configurations as a combination of the configurations inside and outside of the subregions as @xmath28 .",
    "one can define the marginal probabilities as @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we studied the naive definition of the rnyi mutual information : @xmath31 from now on instead of using @xmath32 we will use just @xmath33 .",
    "the known results of the rnyi mutual informations of quantum critical chains are obtained by using the definition ( [ renyi2 ] ) . for special basis , usually the ones where part of the hamiltonian is diagonal ( see @xcite ) , the definition ( [ renyi2 ] ) for the rnyi mutual information gives us a logarithmic behavior with the subsystem size , for arbitrary values of @xmath5 . however , as observed numerically for several quantum chains ( see @xcite ) , it shows a discontinuity at @xmath15 , that forbids the use of large-@xmath5 analysis to obtain the most interesting case where @xmath15 , namely the standard shannon mutual information .",
    "although the definition ( [ renyi2 ] ) has its own uses it is not the one which normally has been considered in information sciences .",
    "for example @xmath34 for @xmath35 is not necessarily a positive function , a property that we naturally expect to be hold for the mutual informations . in this paper",
    "we consider a definition that is common in information sciences @xcite .",
    "the generalized mutual information with the desired properties , as a measure of shared information ( see appendix ) , is defined as @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as before , are the probabilities that the subsystems are independently in the configurations @xmath39 and @xmath40 that forms the configuration @xmath25 that occurs with probability @xmath33 .",
    "hereafter @xmath6 will represent the size of the whole system and @xmath7 and @xmath8 the sizes of the subsystems . with this new notation",
    "one can write @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "this definition of the generalized mutual information comes from the natural extension of the relative entropy to the rnyi case and measures the distance of the full distribution from the product of two independent distributions . in the limit @xmath43",
    "one easily recovers the shannon mutual information @xmath44 , where @xmath27 is the standard shannon entropy .",
    "one of the important properties of @xmath0 , that is not shared by @xmath34 , is its nondecreasing behavior as a function of @xmath5 ( see appendix ) .",
    "our calculations for a set of distinct quantum spin chains will be done numerically , since up to our knowledge an analytical method to consider these quantum chains is still missing .",
    "in this section we will numerically calculate the ground - state generalized mutual information of two series of critical quantum spin chains with slightly different structure . in the first part we will calculate the generalized mutual information for systems with discrete symmetries such as the @xmath16-state potts models with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the ashkin - teller model and the parafermionic @xmath1-quantum spin chain @xcite for the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in the second part we will calculate the generalized mutual information for systems with @xmath4 symmetry such as the klein - gordon field theory , the xxz model and the fateev - zamolodchikov model with different values of their anisotropy parameters .",
    "in this subsection we will study the generalized mutual information of the ground state of different critical spin chains with @xmath1 discrete symmetries .",

    "for this reason we discuss them together . the critical @xmath16-state potts model in a periodic lattice",
    "is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath51    where @xmath49 and @xmath52 are @xmath53 matrices satisfying the following @xmath1 algebra : @xmath54=[s_i , s_j]=[s_i , r_j]=0 $ ] for @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "the model is critical and conformal invariant for @xmath65 with the central charge @xmath66 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that at @xmath67 we recover the @xmath64 potts model and at @xmath68 the model is equivalent to two decoupled ising models .    in the paper",
    "@xcite we already showed that the shannon and rnyi mutual informations , as defined in ( [ renyi2 ] ) , are basis dependent . in other words",
    "one can get quite distinct different finite - size scaling behaviors by considering different basis .",
    "surprisingly in some particular basis , that we called conformal basis , the results shows some universality .",
    "for example , the results for the @xmath16-state potts model and for the ashkin - teller model in the basis where the matrices @xmath52 or the matrices @xmath49 are diagonal are the same , and follow the asymptotic behavior @xmath69 with @xmath70 we should mention that in @xcite , based on numerical results , it was claimed that for @xmath15 the coefficient @xmath71 might not be exactly equal to the central charge .",
    "as it was discussed in @xcite it is quite likely that @xmath34 is not a continuous function around @xmath15 and so any attempt to do the replica trick using this definition of rnyi mutual information will be useless .",
    "this makes the analytical calculation a challenge .",
    "this is an additional reason to examine the behavior of @xmath0 , besides being the correct extension , from the point of view of a measure of shared information . having this in mind we calculated the @xmath0 for @xmath17 and @xmath64 potts chains and for the ashkin - teller model in the @xmath61 and the @xmath50 basis .",
    "we found that in some regimes of variation of the parameter @xmath5 one can fit the data nicely to @xmath72 being @xmath10 a monotonically nondecreasing function of @xmath5 , consistent with what we expect for the mutual information , since it is a good measure of shared information ( see the appendix ) .",

    "most of our analysis was purely numerical due to the absence , at the moment , of suitable analytical methods to treat this problem .",
    "we considered several integrable quantum spin chains .",
    "these quantum chains either have a @xmath1 symmetry ( like the @xmath16-state potts model with @xmath17 and 4 , the ashkin - teller model , and the @xmath1-parafermionic model with @xmath45 and 8) or a @xmath4 symmetry ( xxz quantum chain and the spin-1 fateev - zamolodchikov model ) .",
    "we also considered the discrete version of the klein - gordon field theory given by a set of coupled harmonic oscillators . in this case",
    "we have a continuum hilbert space .",
    "we observed that by expressing the ground - state wavefunctions in general basis the obtained results are distinct .",

    "our results indicate that @xmath80 , for @xmath158 , also depends on the anisotropy @xmath73 of the model . on the other hand the models with continuum symmetry showed a similar behavior only for @xmath157 .",
    "for @xmath158 we have strong evidences that most probably the generalized mutual information is not defined .",
    "it is quite interesting that in these cases one can understand most of the results by just studying simple short - range coupled harmonic oscillators .    in order to conclude we should mention that an analytical approach for the shannon entropy or the shannon mutual information ( @xmath181 or @xmath182 in ( [ renyi2 ] ) and ( [ renyi new ] ) ) is a theoretical challenge .",
    "the analytical methods to treat this kind of problem normally use some sort of analytical continuation , in the parameter @xmath5 , like the usual replica trick .",
    "the results we present showing the continuity of @xmath0 around @xmath15 , differently from what happens with @xmath34 , indicate that @xmath0 is probably more appropriate for an analytical treatment .    _",

    "in this appendix we review the definitions of the relative entropy and its generalization : the rnyi divergence .",
    "the relative entropy is defined as the expectation of the difference between the logarithm of the two distribution of probabilities @xmath183 and @xmath184 , from the point of view of the distribution @xmath183 , i. e. , @xmath185 it can be considered as a measure of the difference between the two distributions @xmath183 and @xmath184 . although it is not a symmetric quantity it helps us to define the mutual information of the subsets @xmath186 ans @xmath187 of the system as follows @xmath188 in words , the mutual information between two parts of a system is just the relative entropy between the distribution probability for the whole system and the product of the probability distributions of the different parts .",
    "it tells how much the different parts are correlated .",
    "the natural generalization of the relative entropy is the rnyi divergence and can be defined ( see @xcite for example ) , as @xmath189 it has the following properties : for @xmath190 we have @xmath191 and if @xmath192 then we have @xmath193 .",
    "the especial case @xmath26 gives the usual relative entropy .",
    "we also define the @xmath85 case by : @xmath194 it is worth mentioning that using the above definition @xmath195 is not zero except when for all @xmath196 s for which @xmath197 also @xmath198 holds .      comparing ( [ renyi divergence ] ) with ( [ mutual information from relative entropy ] ) and ( [ relative entropy ] )",
    "the natural definition of the generalized mutual information is @xmath199",
    "the above definition is different from @xmath200 , as given by ( [ renyi2 ] ) , and has been frequently used in different areas of information science .    99 l. amico , r .",
