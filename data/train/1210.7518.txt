    "one of the most intriguing results of general relativity ( gr ) is the uniqueness theorem for the stationary bh solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it implies that in gr all uncharged bh solutions are described by the kerr metric and , therefore , uniquely determined by mass @xmath2 and spin @xmath3 .",
    "astrophysical bhs are believed to be the result of a gravitational collapse , during which all the properties of the progenitor , apart from mass and spin , are radiated away by gravitational radiation ( price 1972a , b ) .",
    "the outer spacetime of an astrophysical bh should therefore ( to a very good approximation ) be described by the kerr metric . since the kerr metric has a maximum spin at which it still exhibits an event horizon , penrose s cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc ) within gr ( penrose 1979 ) requires the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath4 to satisfy @xmath5 a measured value for @xmath4 that exceeds 1 would pose a serious problem for our understanding of spacetime , since this would indicate that either gr is wrong or that a region may be visible to the outside universe , where our present understanding of gravity and spacetime breaks down .    as a result of the no - hair theorem ,",
    "all higher multipole moments ( @xmath6 ) of the gravitational field of an astrophysical bh can be expressed as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( hansen 1974 ) . in particular ,",
    "the dimensionless quadrupole moment @xmath7 satisfies the relation @xmath8 a measurement of the quadrupole moment , in combination with a mass and a spin measurement , would therefore identify the bh as a kerr bh and provide a test of the no - hair theorem for bhs .",
    "concerning possible formation scenarios of psr - bh systems , a detailed discussion is presented in @xcite and @xcite . for the following ,",
    "it is only important to notice that there are several formation scenarios that lead to a psr - bh system with a recycled psr .      the most precise mass measurements for stars ( other than the sun ) come from psr timing observations ( lorimer & kramer 2005 , weisberg   2010 ) . those are achieved in binary psr systems , where in addition to the keplerian parameters one can determine a set of post - keplerian ( pk ) parameters that describe the relativistic correction in the orbital motion and signal propagation . in gr ( and many alternative theories of gravity )",
    "the pk parameters are functions of the keplerian parameters and the two _ a priori _ unknown masses of the system , which can be determined once two pk parameters have been obtained ( lorimer & kramer 2005 ) . in a psr - bh system",
    "the observation of pk parameters will allow the determination of the bh mass with unprecedented precision .",

    "note that @xmath10 is expected to have a significant contribution from the frame - dragging caused by the rotation of the bh , and can _ a priori _ not be used in the mass determination . for a comparison ,",
    "the three stars mark the precision obtained in the hulse - taylor pulsar ( top to bottom : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 ; @xcite).,width=316 ]      it has been shown by @xcite that the lense - thirring precession of the orbit , caused by the relativistic spin - orbit coupling , between the orbital angular momentum and the bh spin , is the best way to measure the magnitude and direction of the bh spin .",
    "once the second time derivatives of the longitude of periastron and the projected semi - major axis become observable in the timing data , the spin can be determined .",

    "@xmath14 denotes the bh mass .",
    "[ fig : spin],width=316 ]      in order to perform a test of the no - hair theorem , it would be necessary to measure the quadrupole moment of the bh . as already argued by @xcite ,",
    "such a measurement has to be based on the periodic features in the orbital motion , caused by the unique structure of the gravitational potential associated with the quadrupole moment .",
    "our simulations , presented in @xcite and @xcite show , that only for a very massive bh ( @xmath15 ) and very tight orbits ( @xmath16 one can hope to measure the quadrupole signature in the data , provided one has the superb timing precision of the ska .",
    "we consider it as not very likely , that such a system can be found in nature , in particular since such a system would have a very short lifetime in the order of a few myr .",
    "according to the previous section , a system consisting of a radio psr and a stellar mass bh will most likely not allow the determination of the bh quadrupole moment to test the no - hair theorem .",
    "since the quadrupole moment becomes more important for more massive bhs , one wishes to find a psr in orbit around the most massive bh in our galaxy , sgr  a@xmath1 in the galactic center ( @xmath17 ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ghez  2008 , gillessen  2009 ) ) . finding and timing a psr in orbit around sgr  a@xmath1 comes with certain challenges , which are discussed in more details in @xcite , eatough  ( this proceedings ) and references therein . in short ,",
    "it is more likely to detect a young psr with a rotational period @xmath18 0.5s , which then would give us a timing precision in the order of @xmath18 0.1 to 1ms .",
    "all this requires observational frequencies @xmath19ghz .",
    "furthermore , one would also have to worry about perturbations by other masses in the immediate vicinity of sgr  a@xmath1 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* liu  2012 ) , and references therein ) . in the results presented here",
    "we assume a clean orbit and a weekly time - of - arrival measurement with 0.1ms uncertainty . as we will see , this is already sufficient , to go all the way to the no - hair theorem test , i.e.   measuring the mass @xmath2 , spin @xmath3 and quadrupole moment @xmath20 of sgr  a@xmath1 with sufficient precision .",
    "for the precision that can be obtained in determining the mass of sgr  a@xmath1 from pk parameters , the psr can be seen as a test mass in orbit around sgr  a@xmath1 . in this case",
    "the measurement of one pk parameter is sufficient",
    ". a fractional precision of @xmath21 , or even better , should be easily possible with a psr in a @xmath22 1yr orbit ( liu  2012 ) .",
    "such a precision is not only key to extract the lense - thirring contribution to the peri - center precession @xmath10 , it would also allow , in combination with astrometric observations of the s - stars , to determine the distance to the galactic center @xmath23 , since , unlike the astrometric mass , the mass measurement from psr timing is not affected by an uncertainty in @xmath23.as infrared astrometry , an uncertainty of just a few pc could be reached . ]      although there is clear indication that sgr  a@xmath1 rotates , its actual rate of rotation is still not well determined , and a rather large range in the estimates of @xmath4 can be found in the literature ( see references in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* liu  2012 ) ) , which is a result of the uncertainty in the underlying model assumptions .",
    "a psr would , in the absence of any major external perturbations , give direct access to the dragging of inertial frames in the vicinity of sgr  a@xmath1 .",
    "like in the case of stellar mass bhs , the ( additional ) precession of a psr orbit due to the frame dragging ( lense  thirring precession ) is the most promising effect to determine the direction and magnitude of the bh spin .",
    "@xcite have used extensive mock data simulations to show , that for orbits below an orbital period of 0.5 years , where external perturbations are likely to be negligible , the spin parameter @xmath4 could be measured with a precision of @xmath24 to @xmath25 , or even better in case of very short orbital periods ( @xmath26yr ) and/or high eccentricities ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this would be a test of the frame dragging caused by a super - massive bh and , like in section  [ sec : bh_spin ] , a test of the ccc inequality @xmath13 .      for a bh , with a given spin parameter @xmath4 , the quadrupole moment grows very fast with increasing mass ( @xmath28 .",
    "for this reason , even for rather wide orbits of several 10au the quadrupole moment of sgr  a@xmath1 is expected to give rise to measurable effects in the orbital motion .",
    "the calculations in @xcite clearly show , that the observable amplitudes of the `` quadrupole effect '' , for an orbit of a few 0.1yr , are of order of several milli - seconds , and should allow a better than 1% test of the no - hair theorem .",
    "in contrast to an astrometric no - hair theorem test ( will 2008 ) , only one star ( here the psr ) is needed and the orbital eccentricity can be considerably less extreme ( see fig .  10 in ( * ? ? ? * liu  2012 ) ) .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen the potential to probe the properties of gravity with a psr in orbit around a bh . but even for gravity theories that predict the same properties for a bh as gr , a psr - bh system would be an excellent probe , that can be superior to all present binary psr experiments .",
    "an important class of gravity theories where this is the case , as pointed out by @xcite , are scalar - tensor theories .",
    "scalar - tensor gravity , in which gravity is mediated by a tensor field @xmath29 and by a massless scalar field @xmath30 , are well motivated and physically consistent alternatives to gr , that have been studied extensively ( see @xcite ) . in the scalar - tensor gravity , investigated in detail in @xcite ,",
    "the orbital motion of a binary system depends , besides the einstein masses @xmath31 , @xmath32 on the effective coupling constants @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and their scalar - field derivatives @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the asymptotic value of @xmath30 at spatial infinity . in a psr - bh system , we have @xmath37 ( and consequently @xmath38 ) because of the no - scalar - hair theorems , which considerably simplifies the equations for the pk parameters given in @xcite . of particular interest here is the leading term in the gravitational wave damping ( dipolar radiation ) of the orbital period @xmath39 , that is simply @xmath40 for a given equation - of - state , the effective scalar coupling of the psr , @xmath41 , depends on the two fundamental coupling parameters of the theory , @xmath42 ( linear ) and @xmath43 ( quadratic ) , and the mass of the psr , which we assume to be the canonical value of 1.4@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite have conducted extensive mock data simulations for different types of telescopes and different orbital parameters to demonstrate the superb capabilities of a psr - bh binary to constrain scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "figure  [ fig : st ] presents some of these results . as can be seen there , in particular with future radio telescopes a psr - bh system would provide an extremely sensitive test for the presence of a scalar degree of freedom in the gravitational interaction .",
