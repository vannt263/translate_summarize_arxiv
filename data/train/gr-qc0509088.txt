    "as presented above , the solution ( [ line ] ) together with ( [ efe1])([efe4 ] ) admits singularities at @xmath126 and @xmath127 . the first singularity is avoided by noting that the life of the star is usually taken to start at @xmath128 and end at @xmath129 .",

    "for early times ( large negative values of @xmath7 in which we only take real roots ) @xmath131 and so the expression does not evaluate to zero regardless of the sign taken .",

    "et al_@xcite for a further discussion of this approach . ) .",
    "it is a simple matter@xcite to match ( [ core ] ) to ( [ line ] ) at some inner boundary @xmath104 . since ( [ core ] ) is not singular at @xmath132 , this singularity is avoided .    to make a more realistic comparison of the relaxation times ,",
