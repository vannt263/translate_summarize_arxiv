    "in recent years an exotic fluid known as chaplygin gas has well described the reason behind the current observation of cosmic acceleration .",
    "it was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas satisfies an equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the pressure , @xmath2 is a positive constant and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 corresponds to standard chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "this equation of state describes an universe evolving from a non - relativistic matter dominated one to a cosmological constant dominated one @xcite .",
    "the equation of state for the chaplygin gas actually comes from the string nambu - goto action in the light - cone coordinate @xcite .",
    "the idea of this exotic fluid was later used widely @xcite mainly to find a solution to the coincidence problem in cosmology .",
    "the isotropic quantum cosmological models with chaplygin gas have been studied very recently @xcite .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas is also studied in a modified gravity approach @xcite and the geometrical explanation for the generalized chaplygin gas gives the deceleration parameter and the age of the universe which are consistent with observation @xcite .",
    "here we shall study the quantum dynamics of a spatially flat frw model with chaplygin gas and a dimensionless scalar field coupled to the metric .",
    "this formulation was first classically studied by sez and ballester @xcite and there a satisfactory answer to the missing - matter problem in cosmology is given .",
    "recently the quantum description of this sez - ballester theory in a generalized form is studied @xcite . in our case",
    "we take a polynomial coupling of the form @xmath5 to the metric .",
    "we then apply schutz s formalism of a perfect fluid @xcite , which was extensively used in some recent publications @xcite to the chaplygin gas . with the canonical methods @xcite we get the super hamiltonian .",
    "we studied the classical dynamics of the system and found that the remaining matter degree of freedom can play the role of time .",
    "canonical quantization of the super hamiltonian gives us the schrdinger - wheeler - dewitt(swdw ) equation .",
    "then we linearly superpose the wave functions of the swdw equation to construct the wave packet . in the next step",
    "we recovered the classical solutions using the many - world and ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the expression for action in this spatially flat quantum frw model with generalized chaplygin gas can be written as @xmath6 + 2\\int_{\\partial   m}d^3x\\sqrt{h}\\ , h_{ab}\\ , k^{ab } + \\int_md^4x\\sqrt{-g}\\,\\ , p_c\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the induced metric over three dimensional spatial hypersurface which is the boundary @xmath8 of the four dimensional manifold m and @xmath9 is the extrinsic curvature.here units are so chosen that @xmath10 is equal to one.@xmath11 is the pressure for generalized chaplygin gas . here",
    "@xmath12 is an arbitrary function of a scalar field which is coupled to the metric .",
    "the first term(with @xmath13 only ) and the third term were first obtained in @xcite .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas satisfies the equation of state @xmath14 here @xmath2 is a positive constant and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath15 represents the standard chaplygin gas.in schutz s formalism @xcite the fluid s four velocity can be expressed in terms of three potentials @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( here we are studying spatially flat frw model so other potentials are absent in this model because of its symmetry ) , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the specific enthalpy , @xmath18 is the specific entropy , @xmath16 and @xmath17 have no direct physical meaning.the four velocity also satisfy the normalization condition @xmath21 the metric for the spatially flat frw model is @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the lapse function and @xmath24 the scale factor . if we study the thermodynamics of a perfect fluid @xcite we can see that @xmath20 and @xmath18 satisfy these thermodynamic relations @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are temperature and particle number density respectively.we can use schutz s mechanism with these thermodynamic relations to evaluate the third term of the action .",

    "let us now write the super hamiltonian for the minisuperspace of this frw model and that is @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analytical solution of the schrdinger - wheeler - dewitt equation formed from this super hamiltonian is very hard to find.so some meaningful approximation can be made for the last term .",
    "for the early universe scenario we can assume @xmath47 and using this @xcite we can expand the expression of the last term of equation ( [ sh ] ) .",
    "@xmath48.\\ ] ] up to the leading order , the super - hamiltonian takes the form @xmath49.\\ ] ] the canonical transformation @xmath50 would further allow us to simplify the super hamiltonian and finally @xmath51.\\ ] ] here @xmath52 is the only canonical variable associated with matter .",
    "now if we can relate any of the canonical variables with time , we can have a well defined hilbert space structure .",
    "let us now study the classical dynamics governed by the super hamiltonian .",
    "the hamilton s equation of motion are @xmath53,\\\\\\\\ \\dot{\\phi}=\\{\\phi,{\\cal h}\\}=\\frac{n}{2f(\\phi)a^3}p_{\\phi},\\\\\\\\ \\dot{p_{\\phi}}=\\{p_{\\phi},{\\cal h}\\}=n\\frac{p_{\\phi}^2}{4a^3}\\frac{f'(\\phi)}{f(\\phi)^2},\\\\\\\\ \\dot{t}=\\{t,{\\cal h}\\}=n,\\\\\\\\ \\dot{p_t}=\\{p_t,{\\cal h}\\}=0 , \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the constraint @xmath54 .",
    "actually @xmath55 acts as a lagrange multiplier for the system .",
    "if we see the last two equations of ( [ he ] ) we can see that if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 .",
    "so @xmath58 may play the role of cosmic time if we choose the gauge @xmath56 .",
    "also @xmath59(a constant ) from the last equation .",
    "so now with @xmath56 and @xmath59 the third and fourth equation of ( [ he ] ) gives @xmath60 which on integration yields @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an integration constant .",
    "the constraint @xmath54 can be written in terms of canonical co - ordinates with the help of equation ( [ he ] ) @xmath63 with equation ( [ c ] ) and equation ( [ ct ] ) we can solve for the scale factor and it is @xmath64^{\\frac{1}{3}},\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is an integration constant and we can set it to @xmath66 to satisfy @xmath67 .",
    "we will now consider the case @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants and @xmath71 ( actually @xmath72 give us good results for all values of @xmath70 ) . with this and using equation ( [ c ] ) and equation ( [ sf ] )",
    "we get @xmath73\\right\\}^{\\frac{2}{m+2}},\\ ] ]    [ field ]    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      using the many - world interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite we can calculate the expectation value of the scale factor @xmath30 and the field @xmath31 . using equation ( [ sa ] ) and equation ( [ wpf ] )",
    "one can calculate the expectation value of the scale factor @xmath74 straightforward calculation gives @xmath75^{\\frac{1}{3}}.\\ ] ] similarly we can calculate the expectation value for the field @xmath31 . in this case @xmath76 which on integration yields @xmath77 ^ 2d\\phi}{\\int_{\\phi=-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\phi^{\\frac{-2m-3}{2}}\\left[j_{\\frac{2m+5}{m+2}}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{m+2}\\phi^{\\frac{m+2}{2}}\\right)\\right]^2d\\phi}=\\mbox{constant}.\\ ] ] from equation ( [ at ] ) we can see that the expectation value of the scale factor do not vanish at @xmath78 .",
    "so it represents a bouncing non - singular universe and may behave like a dust dominated classical universe at later times . from equation ( [ phit ] ) we see that the expectation value of @xmath31 is independent of time .",
    "it agrees well with the interpretation from equation ( [ fit ] ) and with equation ( [ phia ] ) ( which says that @xmath31 catches a constant value for large values of time and scale factor ) and the behaviour of @xmath79 as shown in figure @xmath80 .",
    "let us now evaluate the expression for the scale factor @xmath30 and the field @xmath31 using ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics . in this formalism",
    "the wave function @xmath81 is written in the form @xmath82 and the conjugate momenta corresponding to the variable @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 portraying the wave function of equation ( [ wpf ] ) in the form of equation ( [ a1 ] ) we find @xmath85 so with equation ( [ a2 ] ) @xmath86 from equation ( [ aphi ] ) with our previously chosen gauge @xmath56 and with equation ( [ a4 ] ) we get @xmath87^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ ] ] and @xmath88 @xmath89 is an integration constant . here",
    "also the scale factor is not zero for @xmath78 , so represents a non - singular bouncing universe and @xmath31 is independent of time .",
    "so the many - world interpretation and the ontological interpretation give us the same behaviour for the scale factor and the field .",
    "but in general both these interpretations may not predict the same behaviour of the variables(seen in anisotropic cosmological models @xcite ) .",
    "here we have studied a flat minisuperspace frw cosmological model with chaplygin gas and a scalar field coupled to the metric .",
    "schutz s mechanism has allowed us to obtain the schrdinger - wheeler - dewitt ( swdw ) equation for this minisuperspace in our early universe .",
    "the chaplygin gas gave us the only remaining matter degree of freedom which finally played the role of cosmic time .",
    "we have constructed a well behaved wave packet from the linear superposition of the wave function of the swdw equation . while solving the swdw equation we did not bother about the factor ordering of the position and momentum operators present in the equation and it is seen that the behaviour of the constructed wave packet remains same for other factor orderings .",
    "most interestingly we observe two peaks in the wave function , which could be interpreted as , that our universe might have evolved from one of those peaks(analogous to states in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "but the choice completely depends upon the initial conditions imposed on the field .",
    "here we have observed that the wave packet propagates in the direction of the scale factor with time but the value of the field remained constant .",
    "we have calculated the time evolution of the expectation value of the scale factor and the field using the many - world interpretation of quantum mechanics and found that a bouncing and non - singular universe .",
    "the divergence of the field is also seen at big bang which assumes a constant value at later times .",
    "we have also calculated the time evolution of the scale factor and the field using ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics and found the same results .",
