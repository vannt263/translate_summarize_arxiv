    "the last decade has seen the emergence of the study of large - scale complex networks such as the web graph consisting of web pages and the links between them , the friendship network on facebook , and networks of interacting proteins in a cell .",
    "several new random graph models were proposed for such networks , and existing models were modified in order to fit the data gathered from these real - life networks .",
    "see the books  @xcite for surveys of such models . a recent trend in stochastic graph modelling is the study of _ geometric graph models_. in geometric graph models , vertices are embedded in a metric space , and the formation of edges is influenced by the relative position of the vertices in this space .",
    "geometric graph models have found applications in modelling wireless networks ( see @xcite ) , and in modelling the web graph and other complex networks ( @xcite ) . in real - world networks ,",
    "the underlying metric space is a representation of the hidden reality  that leads to the formation of edges .",
    "thus , for the world wide web , web pages are embedded in a high dimensional _",
    "topic space _ , where pages that are positioned close together in the space contain similar content .",
    "the graph model we study is a variation on the _ random geometric graph _ , where vertices are chosen at random according to a given probability distribution from a given metric space , and two vertices are adjacent if the distance between the two vertices is no larger than some fixed real number .",
    "random geometric graphs have been studied extensively in their own right ( see , for example , @xcite and the book @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of stochastic graph models usually focusses on asymptotic results , which hold for cases where the number of vertices is sufficiently large .",

    "the infinite limit is a well - known tool for studying scientific models , and it can help to recognize large - scale structure and long - term behaviour ( see @xcite ) . in this paper , we study the infinite limit of a geometric graph model that is a geometric extension of the classic random graph model @xmath8 .",
    "one of the most studied examples of an infinite limit graph arising from a stochastic model is the infinite random graph .",
