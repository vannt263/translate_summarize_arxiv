    "we consider an anisotropic metal close to half filling with a clearly defined most - conducting axis in @xmath2-direction .",
    "it is assumed that two well defined fermi sheets perpendicular to this axis exist ( see fig .",
    "[ figfs ] ) .",
    "the curvature of those sheets is not required to be extremely small , for our argument it is sufficient it is less than e.g. a quarter of the width of the brillouin zone ( i.e. within the shaded area of fig .",
    "[ figfs ] ) .",
    "we consider a rather arbitrary lattice , assuming only the existence of a translation vector @xmath3 of the underlying lattice in x - direction .",
    "umklapp processes lead to a decay of any macroscopic momentum .",
    "for example , close to @xmath4 filling a low - energy umklapp processes ( type ii in fig .  [ figfs ] ) with",
    "a momentum transfer @xmath5 relaxes the momentum in @xmath2 direction , where @xmath6 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "however , a pseudo momentum @xmath7 can be defined , which is conserved by two - particle scattering processes close to the fermi surface as we will show in the following @xmath8.\\label{definep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pseudo momentum @xmath9 is measured with respect to the line @xmath10 ( dashed line in fig .  [ figfs ] ) . here , we concentrate on systems close to half filling  for a quasi 1d system close to a different commensurate filling , other pseudo - momenta are more relevant @xcite",
    ".    to check to what extent @xmath7 is conserved , we calculate the commutator of @xmath7 with a generic 2-particle scattering term :    @xmath11   [ { \\tilde{p}_x},h_2]&=&\\sum_{{\\mbox{1 .",

    "it is easy to check , that all those terms on the right - hand side of ( [ comm ] ) vanish if all four momenta are in the shaded region of fig ,  [ figfs ] , i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . for `` forward scattering '' processes of type i in fig ,  [ figfs ] , @xmath17 ,",
    "both momentum @xmath18 and pseudo momentum @xmath7 are conserved as for all 4 momenta have the same sign .",
    "while `` umklapp '' processes of type ii pick up a lattice momentum @xmath5 , this is exactly compensated by the fact that two electrons are moving from the right to the left fermi surface due to the term @xmath19 g_{1x}/4 $ ] in the definition of @xmath9 ( [ definep ] ) and @xmath7 is again conserved .",
    "the pseudo momentum can only decay by high - energy processes far from the fermi surface , e.g. iii in fig .",
    "[ figfs ] . in a two - particle scattering event ( e.g. in 2nd order perturbation theory )",
    "such a scattering process is exponentially suppressed even at moderate temperatures .    in high orders of perturbation theory ,",
    "however , low - energy contribution can result from these high - energy processes due to virtual excitations . or to put it in the language of renormalization group : @xmath20-particle interactions are generated .",
    "will they relax @xmath7 ? from the definition of the pseudo momentum",
    "it is clear that @xmath7 is conserved modulo @xmath21 .",
    "therefore any @xmath20-particle scattering event will change @xmath7 by a multiple of @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , a relaxation of @xmath7 is not possible if all @xmath22 pseudo momenta @xmath23 involved in the scattering process are smaller than @xmath24 . at low @xmath25",
    ", a decay of @xmath7 by @xmath20-particle collision can only happen for @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the maximal distance of the fermi surface from the plane @xmath28 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figfs ] ) . at sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "the broadening of the fermi - surface and the thermal excitation of states with higher energy will favor decay channels of the pseudo momentum with smaller @xmath20 ( this effect can crudely be described by adding @xmath29 to @xmath27 in ( [ minn ] ) ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the decay - rate @xmath30 of @xmath7 at low @xmath25 in the fermi liquid regime is determined by the usual phase - space arguments : a particle of energy @xmath31 decays in @xmath32 particle and hole excitation , one of the energies is fixed by energy conservation , the remaining @xmath33 energies each have a phase - space of order @xmath34 and therefore @xmath35 where the integer @xmath20 is the smallest value consistent with ( [ minn ] ) .",
    "the prefactor in ( [ gammap ] ) depends in a rather delicate way on the strength and range of the interaction , the screening and the band - curvature .",
    "note , that a _ local _ @xmath20-particle interaction will give no contribution for @xmath36 due to the pauli - principle .",
    "therefore the scattering rate is strongly suppressed for weakly coupled chains with well - screened interactions .",
    "furthermore , additional logarithmic temperature dependences of the scattering vertices are expected even in the fermi - liquid regime as it is well known from fermi liquid theory .",
    "we want to stress that the analysis given above is valid for interactions of arbitrary strength as long as a fermi liquid description is possible ( for strong interaction , one should , however , consider the pseudo momentum of quasi - particles which slightly differs from the pseudo momentum of the bare electrons , defined above ) .",
    "in the preceding section we have established that the pseudo momentum @xmath7 will decay very slowly in a quasi one - dimensional metal .",
    "how does this influence the optical conductivity @xmath37 ?",
    "we will argue in the following , that the pseudo momentum conservation leads to well defined peak in the optical conductivity at zero frequency and we will show how its weight can be calculated reliably . furthermore , the @xmath25-dependence of the dc - conductivity is primarily given by the decay rate of @xmath7 ( [ gammap ] ) at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "we will first try to derive our results using rather simple hand - waving arguments which will be substantiated by some rigorous results derived many years ago @xcite .",
    "we consider the following gedankenexperiment : at time @xmath38 we prepare a state with a finite current @xmath39 . as the current",
    "is not conserved , it will decay rather fast by two - particle collisions ( @xmath40 at low @xmath25 ) .",
    "typically , the initial state with finite current will also have a finite pseudo momentum @xmath41 which will decay much slower than the current ; @xmath42 .",
    "the important point is now to realize that any state with finite pseudo momentum will typically carry a finite current @xmath43 .",
    "accordingly , a finite fraction of @xmath44 will not decay with the fast rate @xmath45 but with the much smaller rate @xmath30 as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figjdecay ] .",
    "how large is the fraction of the current which decays slowly ? to answer this question , we have to consider two separate questions : first , how large is @xmath46 , and second , how much current does a state with finite @xmath7 carry ? at",
    "@xmath38 one obtains in linear response theory the ratio of the expectation values of the operators @xmath47 in terms of the corresponding susceptibilities ( defined as usual ) . to answer the second question",
    ", we consider a situation where a field conjugated to @xmath7 is applied and find in analogy to the argument above @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we expect ( we will discuss later under what condition this statement is rigorously true ) that the low - energy peak in the optical conductivity carries a fraction @xmath49 of the total weight @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "note , that due to the cauchy - schwartz inequality the relative weight @xmath52 is always smaller than 1 as it has to be . for lower and lower temperature",
    "the peak in @xmath37 gets sharper . according to ( [ druderel ] ) ,",
    "the total weight of the peak is @xmath53 @xmath54 should not be confused with the zero - temperature drude weight as we have not included frequencies of the order of the short - time decay rate @xmath40 in the definition of its weight .",
    "it is obvious that the weight of the low - frequency peak in @xmath37 ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ figjdecay ] ) can rigorously be extracted only in the limit @xmath55 , i.e. in a situation where @xmath7 is exactly conserved and @xmath54 is really a finite - temperature drude weight .",
    "in this situation , mazur @xcite has derived long ago an exact inequality for certain correlation functions which in our context reads @xmath56 it is valid if all @xmath57 are conserved and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the importance of mazur s inequality has been recently emphasized by zotos _",
    "@xcite ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , suzuki @xcite showed that the inequality in ( [ mazurinequ ] ) can be replaced by an equality if the sum includes _ all _ conservation laws ! if therefore @xmath7 is the _ only _ ( approximately ) conserved quantity in the system with a finite overlap to the current @xmath60 ( i.e. if @xmath7 is the slowest `` current - like '' mode in the system and @xmath30 the smallest decay rate ) then ( [ drude ] ) is exact as was tested numerically for a simple model in @xcite .",
    "@xmath61 can easily be calculated at low @xmath25 within fermi liquid theory following standard text books @xcite .",
    "the result will in general depend on the details of the momentum dependence of the effective interactions and the band - structure .",
    "we assume a quasi 1d system with a fermi velocity @xmath62 parallel to the most conducting axis and  for simplicity ",
    "completely local interactions characterized by two fermi liquid parameter @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the spin - singlet channel to describe the interactions of two density excitations @xmath65 on the same fermi sheet or on different sheets , respectively . with @xmath66 , the relative weight of the low frequency peak in the optical conductivity for low @xmath25 is given by @xmath67 @xmath68 is defined as an average over the fermi sheet , for example @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the x - component of the fermi momentum on the right fermi sheet .",
    "note that due to luttinger s theorem @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the deviation of the electron - density from half filling .",
    "if the interactions are sufficiently weak so that no phase transition is induced , the low - frequency weight @xmath54 vanishes close to half filling with @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the renormalized fermi energy .",
    "we expect that the low - frequency weight @xmath54 decreases with increasing temperature , mainly due to the thermal broadening of @xmath75 .",
    "leading finite-@xmath25 corrections to ( [ drudefl ] ) or ( [ drudeflhalf ] ) are of order @xmath76 .",
    "the physics of approximate conservation laws and their influence on transport discussed in the previous section is even more important for exactly one - dimensional systems .    surprisingly , little",
    "is known about the conductivity @xmath77 of an ideal one - dimensional wire in the presence of umklapp scattering induced by a periodic potential . for a long time , there has not even an agreement whether @xmath0 is finite or infinite at @xmath78 for generic systems @xcite .",
    "for example , t. giamarchi @xcite found a finite conductivity for @xmath78 within a certain perturbation theory .",
    "however , using a luther - emery transformation of the dominant umklapp process , he concluded that the conductivity is actually infinite @xcite .",
    "furthermore , castella , zotos and others @xcite were able to calculate the drude weight for a number of exactly solvable , integrable lattice models and they also found an infinite conductivity for @xmath78 . from our discussion in [ conduct.section",
    "] this is not too surprising as any integrable model is characterized by an infinite number of conservation laws  this point of view has been emphasized by zotos _",
    "@xcite , who proposed to use ( [ mazurinequ ] ) to obtain an estimate for the drude weight in these models . on general grounds ,",
    "however , one would expect a finite conductivity in any _ generic _ lattice model .",
    "most of the above discussed discrepancies can be resolved from an analysis of the approximate conservation laws of the appropriate low - energy theories as has been realized recently by the author and n. andrei @xcite . within a certain hydrodynamic theory of the approximately conserved quantities ,",
    "the main characteristics of the optical conductivity can be calculated reliably .",
    "the topology of the fermi surface of a @xmath79 metal determines its low - energy excitations .",

    "[ umklapp.fig ] ) .",
    "we shall include in the fields momentum modes extending to the edge of the brillouin zone , usually omitted in treatments that concentrate on physics very close to the fermi - surface .",

    "we wrote the bosonized @xcite version of the hamiltonian . here",
    "@xmath88 , @xmath89 are the spin and charge velocities , and the interactions determine the luttinger parameters @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the high energy processes are captured in the subsequent terms which are formally irrelevant at low energies ( we consider only systems away from a mott transition , i.e. away from half filling ) . some of them , however , determine the low - frequency behavior of the conductivity at any finite @xmath25 , since they induce the decay of the conserved modes of @xmath83 ( they are `` dangerously irrelevant '' ) .",
    "we classify these irrelevant terms with the help of two operators which will play the central role in our discussion .",
    "the first one is the translation operator @xmath94 of the right- and left - moving fields , the second one , @xmath95 , is the difference of the number of right- and left - moving electrons , and is up to @xmath85 , the charge current of @xmath83 : @xmath96 \\\\ \\label{j0 } j_0&=&n_r - n_l= \\sum_{\\sigma } \\int dx   \\left [ \\psi_{r \\sigma}^\\dagger \\psi_{r\\sigma}-\\psi_{l\\sigma}^\\dagger \\psi_{l\\sigma } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the linear combination @xmath97 can be identified with the total momentum of the full hamiltonian @xmath98 .",
    "we proceed to the classification of the formally irrelevant terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "this classification allows us to select all those terms ( actually few in number ) that determine the current dynamics .",
    "@xmath99 includes all terms in @xmath100 which commute with both @xmath94 and @xmath101 , such as corrections due to the finite band curvature , due to finite - range interactions and similar terms .",
    "we will not need their explicit form .",
    "the umklapp terms @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) convert @xmath104 right - movers to left - movers ( and vice versa ) picking up lattice momentum @xmath105 , and do not commute with either @xmath94 or @xmath101 ( see fig .",
    "[ umklapp.fig ] ) .",
    "leading terms are of the form , @xmath106 with momentum transfer @xmath107 .",
    "the important step is to realize that certain pseudo momenta , @xmath108 , defined as linear combinations of @xmath101 and @xmath94 @xmath109 are approximately conserved . for @xmath110 , @xmath111 is nothing but the usual momentum , for @xmath112 we recover the pseudo momentum discussed in section  [ pseudofermiliquid ] .    if the hamiltonian includes only a _",
    "single _ type of umklapp process @xmath113 , then the pseudo momentum is _ exactly _ conserved @xmath114=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] even in the presence of band - curvature and similar terms .",
    "therefore we can expect an infinite conductivity in such a model .",
    "at least two independent umklapp terms are required to lead to a complete decay of the current and a finite conductivity ( an exception are exactly commensurate systems , see @xcite ) .    in any generic lattice model ,",
    "certainly all types of umklapp processes are present or are `` generated '' in the language of renormalization group .",
    "it is clear that in such a situation , the strongest umklapp process will not determine the @xmath25 dependence of the dc - conductivity as the associated conservation law prohibits the decay of the current .",
    "instead , the second strongest umklapp determines the decay rate of the current as we have argued in section  [ conduct.section ] . as",
    "the second strongest umklapp process is typically far from the fermi surface , the conductivity can be very large .",

    "@xcite is based on the memory matrix formalism @xcite . for a certain classical model of charge excitations of a weakly doped mott insulator",
    "these effects have been calculated numerically in @xcite .",
    "these numerical calculations have served as a test for the analytical methods used in @xcite .",
    "if one analyses various scattering processes in ( quasi ) one - dimensional materials , one realizes that many of them can be characterized by approximate conservation laws .",
    "we argued above , that umklapp scattering @xmath119 conserves pseudo - momentum but also scattering from low - energy phonons or slowly varying potential fluctuations are characterized by well - known conserved quantities as is shown in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the consequences can be that e.g. in a situation with very strong umklapp scattering the @xmath25 dependence of the conductivity is determined by phonons , while in a regime where phonons dominate , the power - laws associated to umklapp processes show up in @xmath77 .",
    ".[t1 ] scattering processes and the associated conservation laws [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this analysis applies both to one- and quasi one - dimensional materials independent of whether the system is better described by a luttinger liquid , a fermi liquid or something else ( however , the @xmath25 dependence of @xmath0 will be very different ) .",
    "generically , the low - energy behavior of exactly one - dimensional systems is characterized by an integrable fixed - point hamiltonian with an _ infinite _ number of conservation laws .",
    "it is therefore important to analyze whether these more complicated conservation laws influence measurable quantities like the conductivity for _ generic _ models . for incommensurate systems it is easy to check that at low temperature it is sufficient to keep track of the pseudo - momentum conservation as the decay rate of the relevant @xmath120 is exponentially small in temperature while other more complicated quantities decay with algebraically small rates",
    "the situation is more complicated for an exactly commensurate filling as @xmath121 vanishes with exponential precision if @xmath122 @xcite . in this situation",
    "one has to analyze in more detail the influence of other approximate conservation laws .",
    "preliminary results suggest that for 1d mott insulators with a gap @xmath123 , and for temperatures @xmath124 , more complicated conservation laws of the associated fixed point hamiltonian ( the sine - gordon model in this case ) are indeed important .",
    "this implies , that the optical conductivity will develop a well defined low - frequency peak as sketched in fig .",
    "[ figjdecay ] associated to slowly decaying modes which have their origin in the structure of conservation laws of the sine - gordon model .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed various approximate conservation laws which determine the low - frequency conductivity of clean ( quasi ) one - dimensional materials . for a large class of situations ,",
    "the dominant scattering process leads not to a decay of the current due to the presence of a slowly decaying mode .",
    "in this situation the second strongest scattering process determines the dc - conductivity .",
    "the most important signature of this type of physics is a well - defined low frequency peak in the optical conductivity as is shown schematically in fig .",
