    "technical discussions of the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) sensitivity often focus on its effective sensitivity to gravitational waves in a given band ; nevertheless , the ligo projects goal is to enable a new kind of astronomy  gravitational wave astronomy  and explore the fundamental physics of gravity .",
    "the gravitational waves accessible to ligo are of astronomical origin , arise in regimes of strong , dynamical gravity , and carry with them an imprint of their origin and gravity s character in that regime . from detection",
    "we aim to learn about the fundamental physics of gravity and the astronomical character of the sources , and we build ligo in service of that goal .    exploiting this new observational perspective to explore",
    "the universe is a long - term goal , toward which ligo s initial instrumentation is but a first step . to fully develop",
    "this new observational perspective will require detectors of increasing sensitivity and detectors that explore different spectral bands .",
    "nevertheless , the first generation ligo instrumentation is sensitive enough that even non - detection  in the form of an upper limit  is also informative . in this brief article",
    "i describe in quantitative terms some of the science we can hope to do with first and future generation ligo instrumentation : it short , the `` science reach '' of the detector we are building and the ones we hope to build .",
    "strong gravitational wave sources have characteristics that make them weak electromagnetic observations , and _ vice versa . _",
    "an immediate consequence is that we generally know very little about the most intriguing gravitational wave sources . in choosing the source science that i discuss below , i ve",
    "deliberately taken a conservative approach and focused my attention where speculation can be minimized .",
    "i ve also chosen to stay `` close to the detector '' : i.e. , to focus on the science that comes from direct detection or upper limits , as opposed to interpretation of observations in terms of detailed astrophysical models .",
    "still , we must remember that `` [ i]n the field of observation , chance favors the prepared mind '' @xcite : historically , the opening of a new spectrum to observation has lead to the revision of theoretical models , the development of new ideas , and , frequently , major serendipitous discoveries .",
    "ligo is also a reach into the unknown and it is there the most exciting prospects lay .",
    "a familiarity with the anticipated noise character of the initial and advanced ligo designs is critical to an appreciation of their sensitivity to different sources of gravitational radiation ; for that background i refer the reader to peter fritschel s contribution to this volume . in the remainder of this article",
    "i discuss first compact binary inspiral , focusing on the effective volume of space that ligo can survey for these sources , second on the limits that ligo can place the crustal deformation of young pulsars , thirdly on the energy density in a stochastic gravitational wave background , fourthly on the limits that can be placed on the gravitational radiation that might accompany @xmath0-ray bursts , and lastly on the limits that can be placed on the energy radiated in a stellar core - collapse supernova .",
    "most ligo stories begin with compact binary inspiral . binary systems consisting of neutron stars or stellar mass black holes decay owing to the emission of gravitational radiation . during the last few moments in the life of these binary systems the gravitational radiation , emitted at twice the orbital frequency ,",
    "races through the ligo band before the binary components collide and coalesce into a final black hole ( or , perhaps , another , more massive neutron star supported against collapse by its angular momentum ) .",
    "the detailed character of the radiation emitted during this _ inspiral _ phase is generally accessible to theoretical calculation and , correspondingly , has been studied in great detail ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as inspiral proceeds the binary system becomes more compact and , correspondingly , more relativistic and less accessible to a perturbative , post - newtonian treatment .",
    "ultimately , there is a `` last orbit '' before the two components plunge toward each other and coalesce .",
    "whether the transition from inspiral to plunge is due to a dynamical instability , a secular instability , or simply dissipative forces ( e.g. , radiation reaction ) is an open question , as is the detailed character of the radiation during plunge and coalescence .    for black holes",
    ", coalescence represents the ultimate expression of dynamical , strong field gravity .",
    "it is certainly also accompanied by a burst of radiation @xcite ; however , that burst is extremely difficult to model : the spacetime is dynamical , the fields are strong and the structure of the binary components plays an important role .",
    "_ coalescence _",
    "( which we take to include the plunge from inspiral ) has been a long - term goal of numerical relativity , and recent results suggest that the radiation emitted during this phase alone may be as greater as 1% or more of the systems rest mass @xcite .",
    "lastly , the final remnant of the coalescence will be strongly perturbed from equilibrium and will shed that perturbation , in part through gravitational radiation . this _ ring down _ phase is , by definition , perturbative and the waveform well understood ( even if it is not particularly well structured ) .",
    "the inspiral , coalescence and ring down are consecutive parts of the signature of an inspiraling compact binary system .",
    "a complete search for compact binary inspiral will look for all three components and not single out any given component , ignoring the rest .",
    "nevertheless , the inspiral waveform is better understood , will appear in the ligo detectors at an earlier time , and carry more information about the system , then the signals arising from coalescence or ring down .",
    "in the ligo detectors the inspiral of a binary neutron star system deposits most all of its contribution to the signal - to - noise as the orbital frequency increases from approximately 20  s@xmath1 to about 100  s@xmath1 over approximately 20  s @xcite immediately preceding the coalescence ; additionally , the inspiral waveform carries information about the system s component masses , redshift and luminosity distance @xcite .    for the purpose of comparing the science reach of alternative detectors , then",
    ", we will focus on just the radiation associated with the inspiral of two @xmath2 neutron stars or black holes . assuming that we use matched filtering to detect the inspiral radiation , and that we are contending only with gaussian detector noise",
    ", a false alarm rate of @xmath3 corresponds to a signal - to - noise threshold of approximately @xmath4 for detection . with this criteria we can calculate the observed rate of binary inspiral @xmath5 given the rate density ( on a per co - moving time , co - moving volume , basis ) @xmath6 of inspiraling binary systems and taking into account the anisotropic radiation pattern of the sources and antenna pattern of the detectors .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 we _ define _ to be an _ effective _ volume surveyed by the detector , which we characterize by an effective radius , @xmath8 : @xmath9    lrrr & ns / ns&ns/10 m@xmath10 bh&10 m@xmath10 bh/10 m@xmath10bh +   + @xmath11single ifo&14  mpc&30  mpc&72  mpc + @xmath11three ifo&21  mpc&44  mpc&104  mpc +   + @xmath11single ifo&200  mpc&420  mpc&620  mpc + @xmath11three ifo&350  mpc&740  mpc&1.0  gpc    table [ tbl : cbi ] gives the effective radius @xmath8 for the ligo initial and ( as of this writing ) advanced detector concepts . over the volume surveyed by initial ligo only the most optimistic scenarios give a reasonable event rate for ns / ns binary inspiral ; however , advanced ligo should observe many inspirals , of different types , per year ( see kalogera , this proceedings ) .",
    "an interesting note is that , in terms of the expected binary inspiral detection rate , it is more likely that a ns / ns inspiral will be detected in 3  h of advanced ligo operations than in 1  y of initial ligo operations !",
    "shortly after their formation , rapidly rotating neutron stars develop a solid crust . as they evolve , they gain angular momentum through accretion , lose it through radiation , and see it redistributed between the fluid interior and the solid crust . through these processes , as well as",
    "crust fracturing and the neutron star equivalent of `` continental drift '' @xcite , neutron stars cease being axisymmetric and will radiate periodic gravitational waves with an amplitude proportional to the crust strain .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the stars period and the degree of non - axisymmetry .",
    "if the star is rotating about a principal axis of its moment of inertia the radiation period will be twice the rotational period and its amplitude proportional to the the difference between the moment of inertia of the other two principal axes .",
    "theoretical prejudice regarding the maximum sustainable crust stress bound this difference to less than or of order @xmath12 : _",
    "i.e , _ something less than one part in @xmath13 of the moment of inertia itself @xcite . of less than or of order @xmath14 for these stars",
    "; however , owing to their great age and past history the crust of these stars has been heavily annealed .",
    "thus , this limit is not likely representative of young neutron stars . ]",
    "gravitational wave observations over an extended period will , in principle , be able to bound the _ actual _ strain in nearby pulsars to an order of magnitude greater than this theoretical bound .",
    "to describe the ligo detector s science reach in the context of periodic signals , we ask what limit can be placed on triaxiality parameter @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) for a pulsar , rotating about the principal axis with moment of @xmath17 .",
    "this limit will depend on the pulsar period , detector noise at the gravitational wave period ( half the pulsar period ) , the distance to the pulsar , and the pulsar s declination .",
    "for the purpose of assessing the science reach , focus attention on a source at a distance of 10  kpc and average over the source declination .",
    "figure [ fig : pulsar ] shows the science reach of the initial and advanced ligo detectors .",
    "three curves are shown : the solid curve shows the reach of the initial ligo detector , which is clearly in a position to place interesting , but not challenging , upper limits on pulsars with frequencies @xmath18  hz .",
    "the dashed curve shows the reach of the advanced ligo detector , operating in a broadband mode tuned to maximize the detector s reach for binary inspiral ( as described in the previous section ) .",
    "=    finally , the dash - dot curve shows the science reach for an advanced detector whose optical configuration has been tuned to maximize the its sensitivity at the indicated frequency .",
    "here we go beyond what is proposed for the next generation ligo detectors .",
    "that detector will be tunable ; however , the ability to reach the limit shown depends on choices made in the mirror coatings , which are different if one optimizes for , say , 500  hz to 1  khz frequencies as opposed to 100  hz to 500  hz , and also the quality of the optical components .",
    "the dash - dot curve is the envelope of best possible behavior : i.e. , limited at each frequency by the thermal noise of the proposed , advanced detector .",
    "the actual proposed advanced detector , optimized for detection at a particular frequency , will have a science reach bounded from below by the dash - dot curve and above by the dashed curve . particularly for pulsars closer than the galactic center",
    ", the advanced ligo sensitivity gives us the ability to place challenging upper limits on the crustal deformation in younger pulsars .",
    "@xmath0-ray bursts are sudden , intense flashes of @xmath0-rays lasting anywhere from a fraction of a second to hundreds of seconds . the burst sources are confirmed through observations to be at cosmological distances and involve power outputs of @xmath19@xmath20  erg / s , which is comparable to the total conversion of the sun s rest - mass to @xmath0-rays over the course of a few seconds or to the emission over the same period of as much energy as our entire galaxy radiates in 100  y. this is a far larger luminosity than that of any other known astronomical source @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of @xmath0-ray bursts are not yet well identified and there is good reason to believe they may be a heterogeneous population @xcite .",
    "two classes of progenitors are currently favored : neutron star binary coalescence or hypernovae or collapsars @xcite .",
    "all models converge on the formation of a several solar mass black hole , surrounded by a debris torus whose accretion provides the energy necessary to power the @xmath0-ray burst . the @xmath0-ray burst itself arises as a result of either internal shocks @xcite ( owing to velocity variations ) in the outgoing fireball and/or the formation of forward and reverse shocks when the expanding fireball impacts on , e.g. , the interstellar medium .",
    "the violent formation of a black hole will almost certainly involve a gravitational wave burst .",
    "the qualitative character of that burst will likely depend on the progenitor : e.g. , the spectrum and timescale of the burst arising from a hypernova , or collapsar , or the coalescence of a compact binary will all likely be different .",
    "the interval between the gravitational and @xmath0-ray bursts will depend on whether the @xmath0-ray burst is formed via internal shocks ( timescales on order @xmath21  s ) or the formation of a blast wave and reverse shock as the fireball impacts on an external medium ( timescales on order @xmath22  s ) .",
    "correspondingly , observations of correlated gravitational and @xmath0-ray bursts can _ i ) _ test the general model of @xmath0-ray burst sources ( i.e. , the formation of a several @xmath23 black hole ) , _ ii ) _ potentially distinguish between different progenitors ( e.g. , hypernovae , collapsar or compact binary coalescence ) , _ iii ) _ determine whether the @xmath0-rays are produced via internal or external shocks ( via the interval between the @xmath0-ray and gravitational wave burst ) .",
    "since grbs occur at cosmological distances the signal - to - noise ratio  ( snr ) of any individual gwb will likely be insufficient for direct detection in either the initial or advanced ligo detectors .",
    "nevertheless , it will still be possible to detect a",
    "_ statistical association _ between gravitational wave and @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "if gwbs are associated with grbs , the correlated output of two gw detectors will be different in the moments immediately preceding a grb ( _ on - source _ ) than at other times not associated with a grb ( _ off - source _ ) .",
    "( while we focus on @xmath0-ray bursts here , any plausible class of astronomical events can serve as a trigger . ) a statistically significant difference between on- and off - source cross - correlations would support a gwb / grb association and represent a detection of gravitational waves by the detector pair .",
    "we can measure this difference using student s @xmath24-test without requiring any foreknowledge of the signal waveform , source or source population ( though with such a model the effectiveness of the test can be improved ) .",
    "the measured difference can be used to establish a confidence interval ( ci ) or upper limit ( ul ) on the rms amplitude of gwbs associated with grbs .",
    "the ci / ul , in turn , constrains any model for model for grb / gwb pairs @xcite . the 95% confidence upper limit @xmath25 we can set on the strength of the gravitational waves associated with @xmath0-ray bursts , is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the delay between the gravitational wave and @xmath0-ray burst ( 0.1  s for the internal shock model ) , and",
    "@xmath28 is the number of @xmath0-ray bursts observed ( 1000 bursts will involve about three years of observations with , e.g. , swift ) .",
    "the advanced ligo bound described above corresponds to the conversion of @xmath29 to gravitational waves at @xmath30 .",
    "a stochastic gravitational wave signal , in a single detector , is indistinguishable from detector noise .",
    "it is only when we have two or more independent detectors that we can begin to distinguish between detector noise and a stochastic signal : the stochastic signal , arising as a superposition of plane waves from different directions , will appear as correlated noise in pairs of detectors , with the correlation rolling off for wavelengths greater than half the distance between the detectors @xcite . for the ligo detector - pair the correlation of the two detectors to a stochastic signal has a null at approximately 64  hz and a second null at approximately twice that frequency . beyond that second null",
    "there is very little power in the correlated response of the detector pair to the incident stochastic signal .",
    "it is convenient to characterize the strength of a stochastic background by its energy density in a logarithmic frequency band , relative to the closure density of the universe @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy density in gravitational waves .    when considering sources of detectable stochastic gravitational radiation it is conventional to consider signals of primordial origin : e.g. , radiation arising during an inflationary epoch or from the decay of a cosmic string network ( see @xcite for an excellent review ) .",
    "primordial nucleosynthesis places a bound on the contribution to @xmath34 from these primordial sources of @xmath35 : a larger @xmath34 would lead to a significantly larger he@xmath36 abundance than is observed .",
    "this bound is weak compared to the theoretical predictions on the size of these backgrounds : @xmath37 for inflation and @xmath38 for a cosmic string network .",
    "it is important to note , however , that _ the nucleosynthesis bound does not address gravitational waves produced after nucleosynthesis , _ and there are a number of mechanisms capable of producing significant stochastic gravitational waves at late times . as important , these mechanisms are not exotic ones : they are as simple as the confusion limit of discrete but unresolved conventional astronomical sources of gravitational waves : e.g. , core - collapse supernovae , binaries or binary inspiral , or coalescence , etc .. stochastic sources like these are certainly important for the lisa detector  hz by the radiation from unresolved close white dwarf binaries and other galactic binary systems @xcite . ] @xcite and they may also be for the ligo detector : it all depends on the unknown event rate and luminosity of the individual sources .",
    "to assess the science reach of the ligo detector pair to a stochastic gravitational wave background , we ask what upper limit we can expect to place on @xmath34 _ today _ , based on the observed correlation in the two ligo detectors .",
    "focusing on an observation involving @xmath39  y of data and insisting on a 99% confidence , we find @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hubble constant in units of 100  km / s / mpc .",
    "thus , the initial ligo detectors can improve on the existing in - band limit on a primordial background by a factor of approximately 3 , and set a completely new limit on a background from the confusion limit of more conventional astronomical sources .",
    "the proposed advanced ligo will be able to improve on these bounds by a factor of just over 1000 , challenging some of the more optimistic proposals for a stochastic background from conventional sources @xcite .",
    "as a final example , consider the gravitational waves that arise from the collapse of the stellar core in , e.g. , a type ii supernovae explosion .",
    "the gravitational radiation signature of this source is very uncertain : different plausible models for the progenitor give very different gravitational radiation waveforms @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the different bursts are more similar : the burst is roughly white to a khz , with the energy falling very rapidly at high frequencies . without assuming a waveform for the gravitational wave burst we can compare the cross - correlation of the ligo detector outputs at the expected time of the gravitational wave burst with its value at other times , not associated with a supernova .",
    "the difference of the actual cross - correlation from its mean value can be interpreted , in this model , as a measure of the mean - square @xmath41 averaged over the detectors band . from the distance to the supernova ( and , again , assuming that the spectrum of @xmath41 is white to 1  khz ) we can convert this mean - square amplitude into a measure of the fraction of the stellar cores rest mass ( assumed to be @xmath42 ) converted into gravitational waves .",
    "that efficiency @xmath15 we take to be the `` science reach '' of the detectors for radiation from core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the limit we can place on @xmath43 in the band , and thus on @xmath15 , is better the better we know when the core collapse took place .",
    "if the core - collapse is galactic then we expect to be able to detect the neutrinos directly , allowing us to fix the time of the core collapse to under a second ; on the other hand , if the supernova is extragalactic , then we will have to rely on a backward extrapolation of the light curve , which will allow us to fix the time of the collapse to within an hour . for a supernova at a distance of 55  kpc ( the large magellanic cloud ) ,",
    "the 95% upper limit we can place on @xmath15 is @xmath44    galactic supernova occur at the rate of approximately 1 per 30  y. at the distance of the center of the virgo cluster  15  mpc  the rate is on order 3  y@xmath1 . at this distance",
    "the advanced ligo can place an upper bound of @xmath45 on the efficiency : a physical upper bound ( i.e. , one less than 100% )",
    ".    theoretical prejudice  which , on this source , has revised itself by several orders of magnitude many times over the past three decades  currently estimates the efficiency at @xmath46@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these estimates are based on two - dimensional calculations and focus only on the earliest parts of the collapse . as such",
    "they exclude the radiation that might be associated with axisymmetries in the collapse or in the rapid convective overturn of the hot proto - neutron star , both of which may be significant sources of gravitational radiation . thus , while ligo observations do nt approach these theoretical prejudices , they are nevertheless important for the challenge they make to the prejudice .",
    "i like to say that the initial ligo detectors bound the possible . in the case of binary inspiral",
    "they challenge some of the most optimistic scenarios for the rate density of compact binary neutron star and black hole systems ; they set meaningful upper limits on the crustal deformation of nearby , young neutron stars ; they improve the in - band limits on the strength of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background and set a first bound on the background strength owing to the confusion limit of more conventional astronomical sources ; and , in the event of a galactic supernova while ligo is `` on the air '' , will set a physically meaningful upper limit on the efficiency with which core collapse supernovae produce gravitational waves .    the proposed advanced ligo challenges theory .",
    "it will survey a volume of space that all but assures it should see several ns / ns binary inspirals per year and also establish the rate density of ns / bh and bh / bh binary systems .",
    "it will measure , or further improve the upper limit on , the deformation of the crust of nearby neutron stars ; improve the limits on the stochastic background signal by three orders of magnitude beyond initial ligo ; may well explore the @xmath0-ray burst model ; and place physical bounds on the supernova efficiency .",
