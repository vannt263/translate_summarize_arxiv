    "stark shifts induced by the lattice laser for both clock states exactly cancel  @xcite .    one indicator of clock performance is provided by the allan deviation characterizing the fractional frequency instability @xmath6 . for a signal - to - noise ratio given by the fundamental quantum projection noise",
    ", the instability can be written as : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the resonance quality factor defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the transition frequency and @xmath11 is the linewidth .",
    "@xmath12 is the total number of particles measured in a coherent time period of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the total averaging time .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , atoms with the highest quality factors @xmath8 are preferred for a new generation of time and frequency standards .    the highest @xmath8 s are currently obtained for a narrow transition in the optical domain  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the highly forbidden @xmath15 transitions in divalent atoms offer excellent possibilities for attaining a new level of precision and accuracy for time - keeping .",
    "one of the most promising candidates is @xmath16sr for which @xmath17 1.2 mhz  @xcite , yielding a potential @xmath18 . in a recent paper  @xcite , a systematic uncertainty evaluation for a neutral sr optical atomic standard",
    "was reported at the 10@xmath19 fractional level , surpassing the best evaluations of cs fountain primary standards . the dominant systematic frequency correction and uncertainty in that work arose from the room temperature blackbody radiation ( bbr ) . the fractional frequency shift , @xmath20 , caused by the bbr is proportional to the differential static polarizability of the two clock states . for the @xmath21 transition in sr ,",
    "the bbr shift was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite to be equal to 55.0(7)@xmath22 .",
    "the 1% uncertainty for the bbr shift originates mostly from insufficient knowledge of the static polarizability of the @xmath23 state , with the most accurate calculation provided in  @xcite . to further improve the sr accuracy ,",
    "it is clear that better understanding of the sr properties is needed to give a more accurate determination of the bbr shift .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to outline a clear path to achieve this goal . to improve the clock accuracy significantly , it is equally important that a well - characterized homogeneous bbr environment surrounds the sr atoms in future experiments .",
    "the improvement of the sr clock accuracy requires a more accurate determination of the differential static polarizability of the @xmath24 and @xmath3 states .",
    "note that the static polarizability of the ground @xmath25 state is known at a sufficiently low uncertainty @xmath26 0.1%  @xcite .",
    "this low uncertainty is made possible by a good knowledge of the matrix element @xmath27  @xcite , where the intermediate state @xmath28 contributes to the polarizability of the @xmath29 state at the dominant level of 97% .",
    "consequently , the outstanding challenge is to reduce the uncertainty of the polarizability of the @xmath5 state to a similar level .",
    "even sophisticated modern relativistic methods of atomic calculations can not provide such accuracy .",
    "for this reason , a solution to this problem must combine theoretical and experimental approaches .",
    "we show that four specific intermediate states have a combined contribution to the total static polarizability of the @xmath3 state at the level of 90% .",
    "when the contributions from these four states are determined from experimental data at 0.1% accuracy and the contributions of all other discrete and continuum states are known at the level of 1 - 2% from calculations , then the final 0.1% uncertainty for the polarizability of the @xmath30 state will be achieved .",
    "this strategy is the focus of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly describe the method of calculations .",
    "in particular , we discuss the construction of basis sets and solving the multiparticle schrdinger equation . in section",
    "iii we discuss the blackbody radiation effect and present the results of calculations for the low - lying energy levels , a.c .",
    "polarizabilities , transition rates , and oscillator strengths , and we analyze the results obtained .",
    "section iv contains concluding remarks .",
    "atomic units ( @xmath31 = 1 ) are used throughout the paper .",
    "the most complex problem in precise atomic calculations is associated with the necessity to account for three types of electron correlations , i.  e. , valence - valence , core - valence , and core - core correlations .",
    "the former are usually too strong to be treated perturbatively , while the other two types of correlations can not be treated effectively with non - perturbative techniques , such as the multi - configurational hartree - fock method  @xcite or the configuration interaction ( ci ) method  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to combine the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) with one of the non - perturbative methods . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested to use mbpt in order to construct an effective hamiltonian for valence electrons .",
    "after that , the multiparticle schrdinger equation for valence electrons is solved within the ci framework .",
    "doing so allows us to find the low - lying energy levels .",
    "following the earlier works , we refer to this approach as the ci+mbpt formalism .    in order to calculate other atomic observables",
    ", one has to construct the corresponding effective operators for valence electrons @xcite",
    ". these operators effectively account for the core - valence and core - core correlations . in particular , to obtain an effective electric - dipole operator , we solve random - phase approximation ( rpa ) equations , thus summing a certain sequence of many - body diagrams to all orders of mbpt  @xcite .",
    "the rpa describes shielding of an externally applied field by core electrons .",
    "small corrections due to , for instance , normalization and structural radiation are omitted .    in the ci+mbpt approach ,",
    "the energies and wave functions are determined from the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath32 where the effective hamiltonian is defined as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the hamiltonian in the frozen core approximation and @xmath35 is the energy - dependent correction , which takes into account virtual core excitations .",
    "the operator @xmath35 completely accounts for the second - order perturbation theory over residual coulomb interaction .",
    "determination of the second - order corrections requires calculation of one- and two - electron diagrams .",
    "the one - electron diagrams describe an attraction of a valence electron by a ( self)-induced core polarization .",
    "the two - electron diagrams are specific for atoms with several valence electrons .",
    "the number of the two - electron diagrams is very large and their calculations are extremely time - consuming . in the higher orders the calculation of two - electron diagrams becomes practically impossible .",
    "hence , it is more promising to account for the high - orders of the mbpt indirectly .",
    "one of such methods was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that a proper choice of the optimum initial approximation for the effective hamiltonian can substantially improve the agreement between calculated and experimental spectra of many - electron atom .",

    "if the sum of these four contributions are determined experimentally with an accuracy @xmath260.1% and the contributions of all the rest of the discrete and continuum states are known at the level of 1 - 2% from calculations , the overall polarizability of the @xmath54 state can be determined with the accuracy @xmath260.1%",
    ".    experimental determination of the four dominant contributions may be accomplished directly from lifetime or transition rate measurements .",
    "however , the lifetime data should be accompanied by high accuracy branching ratio measurements .",
    "alternatively , we could measure single channel decay directly to the @xmath55 state .",
    "in addition , it is possible to constrain the four contributions using other spectroscopic data such as the magic wavelength @xmath56 and the light shift at 698 nm , which will naturally be measured and confirmed by a number of future clock experiments . at both wavelength regions the same four states",
    "dominate the polarizability as in the static case .",
    "the general strategy would be to use spectroscopic data to constrain the most dominant contribution for that specific case .",
    "since the @xmath50 state dominates the four critical contributions to the static polarizability , and has less contribution to the dynamic polarizability at wavelengths of interest ( see table  [ ind_contrib ] ) , it would thus be maximally beneficial to measure this contribution directly with an oscillator strength measurement between @xmath55 and @xmath57 . doing so avoids upscaling of the uncertainty via error propagation .",
    "the high accuracy experimental measurement for the @xmath52 state  @xcite can be further improved by monitoring its decay to @xmath55 directly .",
    "then , combining the measurements of @xmath56 and the light shift at 698 nm would allow us to constrain contributions from both @xmath58 and @xmath53 , permitting constraining @xmath59 at the level of @xmath60 .    the magic wavelength , @xmath61 , could in principle also aid the constraint",
