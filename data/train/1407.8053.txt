    "observations strongly support the inflationary paradigm @xcite , and , in particular , they appear to be in agreement with the simplest single field slow - roll inflationary predictions .",
    "however , we are ignorant on what the correct model of inflation is .",
    "a severe obstacle for inflation is to preserve the flatness of the inflaton potential against radiative corrections .",
    "this problem is particularly pressing in models that produce a large gravity wave background , as the flatness needs to be preserved for a large interval of field values @xcite . a well studied way to address",
    "this problem is to impose a shift symmetry broken in a controllable way , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "the use of symmetries is at the basis of the effective field theory of inflation @xcite . as in all effective field theories ,",
    "one constructs the most general operators of a given order that are compatible with a given symmetry , and one studies their phenomenological implications , with the goal of determining or constraining the coefficients of these operators from the data . in the vast majority of the models , the operators under consideration are invariant under spatial transformations - as suggested by the homogeneity and isotropy of the inflationary background - while the invariance under time translation is slightly broken ( compatible with the controllable small breaking of the shift symmetry in the concrete uv realizations that adopt this symmetry ) .",
    "an exception to this is the model of _ solid inflation _",
    "@xcite , in which three scalar fields @xmath4 , that individually break isotropy , are combined to produce a homogeneous and isotropic expansion .",
    "the scalars are imposed to have orthonormal vevs : @xmath5    such a model was first proposed in @xcite under the name of _ elastic inflation _ , and its properties and its phenomenology have been studied in more details in @xcite .",
    "the reason for the name chosen in @xcite is that this model can also be understood as a basic effective field theory for a solid . at zeroth order ,",
    "the properties of a solid are determined by the positions of its fundamental cells .",
    "such positions can be determined by the three scalars @xmath6 , whose vevs give the coordinates at the time @xmath7 of the cell that at time @xmath8 was at position @xmath9 .",
    "the vevs ( [ solid - bck ] ) then describe a solid at rest . in the inflationary application of @xcite",
    "they describe a solid at rest in comoving coordinates . to make the vevs ( [ solid - bck ] ) compatible with homogeneity and isotropy , ref .",
    "@xcite imposes that the lagrangian of solid inflation is only function of so(3 ) invariant combinations of @xmath10 therefore a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background is achieved by ( i ) imposing so(3 ) invariance of the theory under rotations @xmath11 , and ( ii ) tuning the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the three scalars to be orthonormal . with these minimal sets of assumptions , solid inflation is a very simple effective scalar field theory of inflation for which flrw invariance is obtained from a combination of space dependent sources , and for which therefore isotropy is not a fundamental symmetry . due to its peculiar symmetry breaking , solid inflation has some key phenomenological consequences that differ from those of standard scalar field models of inflation .",
    "one such consequences is a nontrivial angular dependence in the squeezed limit of the three point functions ( the bispectrum ) @xcite , which is not present in standard scalar field models .",
    "the squeezed bispectrum is characterized by one momentum , say @xmath12 , much smaller than the other two ( @xmath13 ) in the correlator .",
    "the corresponding mode leaves the horizon before the other two , and it modulates their power spectrum .",
    "the directionality of @xmath12 imprints an angular dependence to this modulation .",
    "however , in standard scalar field models this angular dependence is proportional to the gradient of the @xmath12 mode , and goes to zero in the @xmath14 limit @xmath15 @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath16 operators in solid inflation have a directionality dependence inherited by ( [ solid - bck ] ) , which persists also in the squeezed limit .",
    "such dependence has been studied and confronted with the data in @xcite .",
    "another peculiarity of solid inflation is that it can support a prolonged period of anisotropic inflation @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the medium of solid inflation is a very unconventional solid ( as compared to those that we ordinarily interact with ) , as it is nearly unaffected by the huge inflationary expansion .",
    "to sustain inflation , its energy density had to be nearly constant over the inflationary @xmath17 volume increase .",
    "this can be enforced by a suitable choice of the lagrangian .",
    "once this is done , stability and gaussianity of the primordial perturbations then require that this medium is very insensitive to any deformation @xcite ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ ng - c2 ] ) ) .",
    "this is the fundamental reason why , contrary to the generic inflationary expectation @xcite , this medium is unable to quickly erase a background anisotropy @xcite .",
    "in fact it is possible ( and , probably , likely @xcite ) that the medium of solid inflation is unable to quickly lead to isotropy and homogeneity starting from generic initial conditions .",
    "if this is the case , it is possible that solid inflation does not lead to a solution of the isotropy and homogeneity problem . following the classical background evolution only ( as done in @xcite )",
    "one obtains that isotropy is reached in @xmath18 e - folds ( where @xmath19 is the standard slow - roll parameter ) , contrary to the @xmath20 e - folds of the standard models .",
    "this leads to the question of whether quantum effects oppose this slow classical isotropization ( and , more in general , homogenization ) , and , possibly , prevail over it .",
    "the present investigation aims to study this issue .",
    "these two peculiar properties ( namely , the nonstandard squeezed bispectrum and the slow isotropization ) had previously been encountered in models with vector fields during inflation . it is well known that in the standard u(1 ) invariant case , @xmath21 , vector fields are not excited by the background expansion , and , if produced by something else , they rapidly decay . to contrast this ,",
    "a number of models broke the u(1 ) symmetry in different ways , showing that this can allowed for a long - lived vector vev @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry introduces an additional polarization that turned out to be a ghost for all these models @xcite .",
    "a more successful alternative is to modify the kinetic term while preserving the u(1 ) invariance .",
    "this can be done for instance by multiplying the standard kinetic term by a function of the inflation , @xmath22 .",
    "a suitable choice of this function can result in ( nearly ) constant magnetic @xcite or electric @xcite vev of the vector field .",
    "this second choice can support anisotropic inflation .",
    "the same function also produces frozen scale and ( nearly ) scale invariant vector perturbations outside the horizon .",
    "these perturbations imprint an anisotropy to the power spectrum ( ps ) @xcite and give rise to a bispectrum that , analogously to that of solid inflation , has a nontrivial angular dependence in the squeezed limit , where it is peaked @xcite .",
    "in all these studies the vector vev is taken as an arbitrary initial condition , with the exception of @xcite .",
    "this last work estimated the value of the vev that can be expected in a given inflationary realization .",
    "this quantity is related to the infra - red ( ir ) modes of the vector field .",
    "these are the modes that left the horizon between an early moment during inflation ( we conventionally denote this moment as the beginning of inflation ) and the moment in which the large scales cmb modes left the horizon .",
    "to our knowledge , the first work that studied the effect of the vector ir modes is ref .",
    "@xcite , which showed that if the vector field has a red spectrum , the energy in these ir modes becomes comparable to that of the inflaton , so that their backreaction strongly affects the inflaton dynamics @xcite ( and , typically , suppress the magnetic field production to an unobservable level ) .",
    "it is implicit in @xcite that the ir modes , despite being of wavelength larger than our hubble patch , have a physical influence on the background dynamics .",
    "each ir mode is observed in our patch as a classical homogeneous quantity .",
    "observations can only be affected by the sum of these modes , and this sum is indistinguishable from a spatially constant vev .",
    "consider for instance a very light scalar field in a de - sitter ( ds ) geometry .",
    "as well known @xcite ( and as we review below ) , the variance of this field grows with time as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the expansion rate , and @xmath25 is the number of e - folds .",
    "modes that leave the horizon during these @xmath26 e - folds contribute to this variance , and the @xmath27 proportionality is typical of the stochastic addition of these modes ( a `` random walk '' sum ) . if @xmath28 at the initial time , and if we could observe a large number of realizations of these @xmath26 e - folds of expansion , and plot the distribution of @xmath29 obtained in these realizations , we would obtain a gaussian curve with zero mean and with the above variance .",
    "if , as it is the case , we can observe only one realization of these @xmath26 e - folds , then @xmath30 should be treated as a classical stochastic variable drawn from such gaussian distribution .",
    "it is possible that , by mere chance , the ir modes added up to a very typical value in our patch ( even a value very close to zero ) .",
    "however , we should expect @xmath31 while very different values are exponentially improbable .",
    "if anisotropic sources are present , and if the model is constructed in such a way that these sources have a scale invariant spectrum , then their individual vevs break isotropy .",
    "each component of a vector field will in this case be a classical quantity obtained from a gaussian distribution of variance @xmath32 .",
    "as a consequence , if this model is realized in nature , the vector during inflation will develop a vev in our hubble patch that breaks isotropy .",
    "@xcite showed that , in the @xmath33 , the expected vev developed with @xmath34 e - folds of inflation is enough to lead to unacceptable violation of statistical isotropy @xcite , if @xmath35 is chosen so to produce a scale invariant vector spectrum .",
    "one could even start with a triplet of vectors , and arrange their vevs to be initially orthonormal @xcite .",
    "this orthonormality will be preserved by the classical equations of motion , if the theory is symmetric under the exchange of these three vectors .",
    "there is however no reason why quantum fluctuations should respect this .",
    "each field fluctuates on his own , and the value of @xmath36 for each field ( @xmath37 ) should be understood as originating from three _ different _ drawing from the _ same statistical distribution_. in shorts , the theory is symmetric and isotropic , but any one given realization of the theory in which quantum effects are relevant is not .",
    "a breaking of isotropy from ir effects should be expected also in solid inflation .",
    "even if the theory is so(3 ) invariant in field space , and the vevs ( [ solid - bck ] ) are imposed at the start , the ir modes will in general add up to values that break the orhonormality of the three vevs .",
    "the goal of the present investigation is to quantify this effect . specifically , we point out the similarities with the effects of the ir modes within the @xmath38 inflation models and then we compute the random walk sum of the various individual ir modes . using the solution of the anisotropic background found in  @xcite for the evolution of each ir mode in the super - horizon regime , we are able to compute the resulting level of background anisotropy , and the consequent statistical isotropy breaking in the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations .",
    "the breaking in the power spectrum is proportional to the background anisotropy , with a proportionality coefficient related to the amplitude of the squeezed bispectrum in the model @xcite .",
    "if this bispectrum is closed to its observational limit , so that one of the most characteristic predictions of the model can be observed perhaps already in the next planck release , we obtain that the ir modes generated in about @xmath39 e - folds of inflation can lead to violation of statistical anisotropy in excess to the current observational limit @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : solid - review ] we review the model of solid inflation @xcite , its bispectrum @xcite , and its bianchi - i solution @xcite . in section [ sec : ir ] we compute the ir perturbations of the three fields @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : smallv ] we show that the contribution to the ir modes from vector perturbations is subdominant w.r.t to the scalar ( longitudinal ) ones . in section [ sec : aniso ] and in sec .",
    "[ cmb ] we quantify the corresponding breaking of statistical isotropy studying its dependence on the parameters of the model . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we comment and interpret our final results .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the lagrangian of solid inflation is function of so(3 ) invariant combinations of the @xmath40 elements defined in ( [ b - ij ] ) .",
    "this guarantees that the vevs ( [ solid - bck ] ) are compatible with the flrw background @xmath41 only three such independent combinations exist , that in @xcite are chosen to be @xmath42 denoting the action of solid inflation as @xmath43 \\right\\ } \\ ; ,   \\label{action}\\ ] ] one obtains , on the background configuration ( [ solid - bck ] ) and ( [ frw ] ) , the energy density and pressure @xmath44 where the suffix on @xmath45 denotes functional derivative ( we see that both @xmath46 are required ) . to have inflation , one requires @xmath47    we note that @xmath48 are normalized in such a way that only @xmath49 depends on the volume factor of the universe .",
    "the slow roll condition ( [ epsilon ] ) can be understood as the requirement that the solid is extremely intensity of volume deformations .",
    "the fact that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are insensitive to the volume immediately explains why derivatives of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not enter in the expression for the pressure , and are unconstrained by the slow roll requirement .",
    "nonetheless also these derivatives are constrained . at zeroth order in slow roll , and in the deep sub - horizon regime ,",
    "the sound speed of the scalar ( l = longitudinal ) and vector ( t = transverse ) perturbations of the solid are given by @xmath52 so that the requirements @xmath53 translate into @xmath54 and therefore @xmath55 .",
    "a further study of the perturbations in this model shows that the individual @xmath56 and @xmath57 derivatives also need to be small .",
    "this can be seen from the study of non - gaussianity ( ng ) in the model .",
    "as we remarked in the introduction , the bispectrum @xmath58 of solid inflation is enhanced in the squeezed limit , where it shows a nontrivial angular dependence .",
    "it is convenient to use the parametrization for the bispectrum introduced in @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the comoving momenta of the modes in the correlator , @xmath61 are the legendre polynomials , @xmath62 is the ps , and finally @xmath63 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath60 and @xmath64 .",
    "only @xcite in the squeezed limit .",
    "higher order terms are a signature of sources that break isotropy @xcite , as was first obtained in presence of vector fields @xcite , and later in solid inflation @xcite . ] solid inflation gives @xcite @xmath65 where the numerical value is the planck limit @xcite .",
    "we therefore see that all @xmath66 need to be @xmath67 .",
    "therefore the medium of solid inflation needs to respond very weakly to any geometry deformation . starting from this observation , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the model allows for a prolonged anisotropic inflationary expansion , at odds with standard inflationary models , in which any initial anisotropy is erased within a few hubble times @xcite . for simplicity , ref .",
    "@xcite considered a bianchi - i universe with planar symmetry in the @xmath68 directions : @xmath69 \\ , ,   \\label{bianchi - i}\\ ] ] and showed that the anisotropy evolves as @xmath70 where @xmath71 are integration constants .",
    "while the first mode exhibits the typical fast decrease of the anisotropy , the decrease of the second mode is suppressed by the slow roll parameter @xmath19 , so that any initial anisotropy can survive for @xmath18 e - folds during inflation .    while ref .",
    "@xcite studied the background evolution starting from an anisotropic initial condition ( @xmath72 ) , in the next sections we study how the anisotropy is developed by the generation of long wavelength modes during inflation .",
    "in the @xmath73 mechanism , the kinetic term of the vector field is multiplied by an ad - hoc function of the inflaton field @xmath74 , appropriately chosen so to allow for a constant electric or magnetic component of the vector field ( see @xcite for a general discussion ) .",
    "this also result in scale invariant and constant vector perturbations @xmath75 at super - horizon scales . even in absence of any other coupling , the same @xmath73 operator responsible for the constant background @xmath76 also gives rise to a coupling @xmath77 , which imprints statistical anisotropy in the inflation perturbations @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , even if one choses initial conditions such that @xmath78 at some given moment during inflation , the long wavelength modes of the vector fields generated during inflation add up ( in a stochastic way ) to a coherent classical background , that is completely indistinguishable from a homogeneous field @xmath76 by modes on much smaller scales .",
    "therefore the vector field unavoidably generates background anisotropy , and statistical anisotropy of the primordial perturbations .",
    "we now show that the role played by the vector vev in the @xmath73 mechanism is here played by a difference in the background gradients of the three fields .    in the original solid inflation paper @xcite , the classical background configuration ( [ solid - bck ] )",
    "is assumed .",
    "we assume that the scalar fields profile agrees with ( [ solid - bck ] ) at some early time @xmath79 during inflation , that we conventionally denote as the start of inflation .",
    "we denote by @xmath80 the number of e - folds of inflationary expansion from this moment to the end of inflation . in general , this quantity is greater than ( and , possibly , much greater than ) the number of e - folds before the end of inflation at which the large scale cmb modes left the horizon . we denote this latter quantity as @xmath81 , with the standard expectation that @xmath82 .",
    "we denote as ir modes the modes of @xmath83 that leave the horizon in the `` initial '' @xmath84 e - folds of inflation .",
    "these modes are seen as a classical homogeneous background by modes of cmb and smaller scales , and , for all purposes , are indistinguishable from a homogeneous background in our hubble patch .",
    "these modes have already become classical by the time the cmb modes are produced , and should be added up with ( [ solid - bck ] ) to provide the background on which the cmb modes are produced .  ) at @xmath85 .",
    "if present , these modes will in general increase the anisotropy with respect to the amount that we compute here .",
    "therefore , our result is in general a lower bound estimate for the amount of anisotropy that should be expected after @xmath86 e - folds of inflation . ]    to compute this ir contribution , we decompose the perturbations as in @xcite : @xmath87 and we adopt the @xmath88 convention for the fourier transform .",
    "the mode @xmath89 in ( [ solid - perts ] ) is a scalar perturbation .",
    "scalar perturbations are customarily characterized by the gauge invariant variable @xmath90 , that represents the curvature perturbations on uniform density hypersurfaces . in spatially flat gauge ( @xmath91 ) , the longitudinal mode @xmath89 is related to @xmath90 by @xcite : @xmath92    the modes @xmath93 in ( [ solid - perts ] ) are vector perturbations , and they are transverse . we decompose them in two polarizations : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath97 factor has been inserted in ( [ vector - deco ] ) since the modes @xmath98 are those with a ( nearly ) scale invariant power spectrum .",
    "we define the ps as usual : @xmath99 under the assumption that @xmath100 coincides with the observed cosmological perturbations , we write @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the planck pivot scale , while we use the central values @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite in the our estimates below .",
    "the ps of the vector modes is related to the scalar one by @xcite @xmath105 where we recall that @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the sound speed of the scalar and vector modes , respectively , see eqs .",
    "( [ cl - ct ] ) .",
    "the perturbations ( [ solid - perts ] ) modify the field profiles ( [ solid - bck ] ) into @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the comoving momentum of the modes that left the horizon at @xmath79 ( in our convention , they are the modes leaving the horizon @xmath80 e - folds before the end of inflation ) , while @xmath110 is the comoving momentum of the large scales cmb modes ( those leaving the horizon @xmath81 e - folds before the end of inflation ) .",
    "as we already discussed , for what concerns observations within our hubble patch , the classical inflationary scalar field background is not given by ( [ solid - bck ] ) but rather by the vev of @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the sum of ir modes . by the time the cmb modes are produced , these ir modes have left the horizon and have become classical . if we could observe many realization of the first @xmath84 e - folds of inflation , and compute the distribution of the ir modes in all these realizations , we would observe a ( nearly ) gaussian distribution with the variance related to the ps ( [ ps ] ) .",
    "however , we observe only one realization of the first @xmath84 e - folds of inflation , and therefore @xmath112 needs to be treated as a stochastic classical quantity , drawn by this ( nearly ) gaussian distribution .",
    "in general , the ir contribution in ( [ classical ] ) leads to statistical anisotropy .",
    "for this reason , we need to assume that it is small ( the goal of this study is to quantify this contribution , and to study under which conditions it is indeed sufficiently small ) . under this assumption",
    ", we can taylor expand the sum ( [ classical ] ) as : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a given point in the universe ( say , our current location ) .",
    "we recall that the scalar fields enter in the lagrangian of solid inflation in the form @xmath115 .",
    "so , the quantity @xmath116 in ( [ taylor ] ) is unphysical and we disregard it .",
    "the linear and quadratic terms are instead physical , and they are given by @xmath117    it is instructive to compare this to the ir contribution to the classical profile from the ir modes in the case of standard scalar field inflation .",
    "recall that in this case , in spatially flat gauge , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the zero mode . keeping into account the ir contribution to the classical profile",
    "gives @xmath120 which we also taylor expand @xmath121 resulting in @xmath122    as discussed above , the operators @xmath123 are classical stochastic variables drawn by ( nearly ) gaussian distributions with zero mean and variance given by @xmath124    in this discussion we disregard the small departure from scale invariance , namely we set @xmath125 in ( [ ps - param ] ) ( the effect of @xmath126 will be properly taken into account in the following sections ) .",
    "then , from the standard result @xmath127 we obtain @xmath128    once inserted in ( [ taylor - standard ] ) , the first line in ( [ t0-t1-stnd ] ) reproduces the well known result @xcite that the variance of the scalar field grows linearly during inflation ( as the different ir modes add randomly to each other , their sum grows in the typical `` random walk '' manner ) @xmath129 the second line in ( [ t0-t1-stnd ] ) shows instead that the scalar field gradient is typically negligible , as it leads to a difference @xmath130 in our observable patch .",
    "this is negligible if @xmath131 , which we assume to be the case .    despite relevant for the background evolution during inflation ( particularly in the self - reproducing regime , in which the quantum diffusion ( [ variance - stnd ] ) can even dominate over the classical evolution @xcite ) for a single homogeneous scalar field",
    "the quantity @xmath132 can not be observationally distinguished from the zero mode value @xmath119 , and indeed @xmath119 can simply be rescaled to include the ir contribution in our observable patch .",
    "apart from the numerical coefficients , the different behavior with time of the two operators in ( [ t0-t1-stnd ] ) simply follows from the momentum - dependence of the integrands in ( [ t0-t1-stnd - integral ] ) . by comparing ( [ theta-12 ] ) with ( [ theta-12-stnd ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath133 in solid inflation scales as @xmath132 , while @xmath134 in solid inflation scales as @xmath135 .",
    "we therefore see that the quadratic terms in ( [ taylor ] ) are negligible , while the linear terms can potentially be relevant .",
    "contrary to the standard case of a single homogeneous scalar field , these terms lead to violation of statistical isotropy ( compare the situation of a homogeneous scalar field and a homogeneous vector field in a given region .",
    "the homogeneous scalar field is simply a number , while a homogeneous vector points in a given direction and breaks isotropy ; consider for instance the case of a constant electric field in a parallel - plate capacitor ) .",
    "we quantify this effect in the next section .",

    "for this reason , in our estimates we disregard the contribution from the vector modes to the ir sum .    with only the scalar contribution included , @xmath142 is symmetric in @xmath143 .",
    "as a consequence @xmath144 can be diagonalized with a simultaneous rotation of the fields and of the spatial coordinates . therefore ,",
    "as long as the vector modes and higher order terms in the taylor expansion are disregarded , we can write , without loss of generality @xmath145 which are the expressions that we use in the following computations .",
    "we assume that the scalar field vevs are given by ( [ solid - bck ] ) and that the background is isotropic at the `` initial '' time of inflation @xmath79 .",
    "every time interval @xmath146 , some modes of @xmath83 leave the horizon and become classical .",

    "since we know that the final anisotropy needs to be small ) these contributions simply add up independently , so we can focus on the contribution of the anisotropy from each individual mode , and then add up .",

    "their contribution to the anisotropy is negligible from the contribution that originates from @xmath83 , and that we now compute .    to simplify this computation , from now on we assume a so(2 ) symmetry between the @xmath154 and @xmath155 direction , and set @xmath156 .",
    "this assumption is not correct , since , as we remarked , the quantum fluctuations of the the different fields do not respect any symmetry .",
    "we do so only for computational simplicity , and to be able to use the results of @xcite , where such a symmetry was also imposed .",
    "this will result in a lower bound estimate for the overall anisotropy ( since we are artificially setting to zero some of its components ) .",

    "as much as the fluctuations of the individual vector fields break ( [ vector - bck ] ) in any one given realization of the @xmath38 mechanism , the fluctuations of the individual scalar fields of solid inflation break the isotropic vev configuration ( [ solid - bck ] ) . in this work , we have quantified the expected level of statistical anisotropy due to this breaking in the solid inflation model .",

    "the squeezed bispectrum is a measure of how a large wavelength mode can influence the power spectrum at shorter scales .",
    "the dependence of @xmath226 on it is due to the fact that the anisotropy of the power spectrum can be understood @xcite as the modulation of the two point function of the cmb perturbations from the much larger ir modes that produce the background anisotropy @xmath168 .",
    "therefore it is possible that , even if the ir sum provides a large background anisotropy , the effect in the power spectrum is small if the parameters of the model result is a small non - gaussianity . on the other hand , for the model",
    "not be simply an interesting mathematical construction one should hope that we will be able to detect the peculiar shape to its bispectrum .",
    "therefore , if the non - gaussianity in the model is closed to its maximal allowed region , the solid curves in figure [ fig : fig1 ] provide a good estimate on the expected statistical anisotropy in the model .",
    "we see that a nontrivial region of the parameter space of the model predicts a level of anisotropy above the observational limit @xcite .",
