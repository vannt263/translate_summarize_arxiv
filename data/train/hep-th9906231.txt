    "the concept of locally anisotropic strings and of the nonlinear @xmath0model had already been advanced in some works @xcite .",
    "there has been given the substantial body of conceptual motivation and necessary geometrical language adopted to develop the locally anisotropic ( super)strings @xcite , and their extensions to superstrings @xcite .",
    "the diversity of results formulated and obtained in locally anisotropic physics @xcite provoked and justified a special interest for modelling of nonlinear @xmath0model on spaces with local anisotropy .",
    "as the nonlinear geometry considered sometimes inadequate or rather inappropriate for the easily accepted standard mathematical tools to explain physical phenomena , physicists always remain  unhappy  that the diverse nature of the phenomenon considered is somewhat straiten out by isotropic and/or linear approximations .",
    "a physicist always wants that linear isotropic mathematical tool applied to describe a phenomena keep the model flexible enough to consider possible intrusions deviations , interferences , interactions and corrections .",
    "it has been a predominant practice that intrinsically desired flexibility is introduced or accounted for with the help of some external to the initial mathematical tool of model assumptions or approximations .",
    "it does though make happy the physicist , however demonstrating after all , how innovative the human intelligence is , yet leaves one with the sense of self - inconsistency of the theory itself .",
    "the proposed example demonstrates how the nonlinear geometry - spaces with nonlinear connection or spaces with local anisotropy , spaces that evidently will make happy any physicist to modulate a phenomena , once he / she has an appropriate mathematical tool to work with , allows the generalization of the non - linear @xmath0model .",
    "the explicitly constructed model on locally anisotropic spaces gives not just necessarily locally anisotropic corrections , but is manifestly renormalizable and consistent with the standard previously obtained results of nonlinear @xmath0model and what is important essentially widens the horizon of modelling string theories .",
    "the rich nature of the fiber - base structures allows , apart from construction of strict physically friendly results , hypothetical interpretation of the fiber - base objects , as for instance the interaction gauge like fields .",
    "this objects serve also simultaneously as some additional terms - calculated explicitly in this work - for the standard nonlinear @xmath0model .",
    "the fiber - base objects , reasonably judged , may lead to some further developments of string theory as for , instance the consistent explication of the string interactions .",
    "the above suggested ideas may justifiably present certain interest for physicists .",
    "the article is structured sa follows : first goes a brief introduction into locally anisotropic geometry and objects ; than the equations of motion and tensor of energy - momentum of locally anisotropic strings is considered ; follows the accommodation of the standard background field method ; later the effective action order extension and locally anisotropic counterterms discussed widely ; the article finalizes conclusions and discussions of the obtained results .",
