    "relativistic models built with hadronic degrees of freedom have been very successful in describing different properties of nuclei and hadrons at low and intermediate energies ( for comprehensive reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in some of these models ,",
    "the hadronic lagrangian has symmetries which are inspired by the underlying qcd theory .",
    "this allows one to have fewer parameters , thereby reducing ambiguities in the hadronic models .",
    "one of the first models which incorporated the @xmath7 symmetry was the gauged linear @xmath8 model ( glsm ) developed in ref .",
    "this model was an extension of the linear @xmath8 model and included , in addition to the pion and scalar meson , the vector @xmath9 and axial - vector @xmath10  mesons as gauge bosons of the local @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "the local symmetry was explicitly broken by the vector - meson mass terms , and spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) by the scalar field led to the mass splitting between the @xmath9 and @xmath11 this model was elaborated in @xcite , where the current - field identities were established .",
    "later the model was applied @xcite in a description of the meson properties . because of some difficulties additional terms are often included .",
    "these terms break further the local symmetry and introduce additional parameters , which allow for a better description of the meson observables @xcite .",
    "the qhd - ii model , which respects the local @xmath12 isospin symmetry , was developed in refs .",
    "it was extended in ref .",
    "@xcite by adding the chiral @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "this model , called qhd - iii , is a chiral invariant theory based on the local symmetry @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons are included as the gauge bosons which are initially massless .",
    "the masses are generated through ssb and the higgs mechanism .",
    "the lagrangian of qhd - iii includes the lagrangian of glsm and the lagrangian of the higgs fields .",
    "the need for the latter sector of the model was clearly explained in ref .",
    "@xcite : the higgs mechanism in glsm with local symmetry leads to the disappearance of the pion which plays the role of a would - be goldstone boson giving its degree of freedom to the massive @xmath10 meson . therefore the higgs sector serves to generate the masses of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons and to preserve the pion as a physical degree of freedom .",
    "due to the local gauge symmetry the model is renormalizable and does not require the introduction of cut - off parameters .",
    "it is also parity conserving by construction .",
    "a subtle aspect of qhd - iii ( but also of glsm and other hadronic models including the axial - vector meson ) is the presence of a bilinear term mixing the @xmath10 and pion fields .",
    "this considerably complicates the interpretation of the physical particles in the theory as well as calculations with this lagrangian .",
    "one way to get rid of the mixing was considered in @xcite and later used in other papers @xcite .",
    "it consists of a re - definition of the @xmath10 field and subsequent wave - function renormalization of the pion field .",
    "the final lagrangian takes a complicated form with strongly momentum - dependent vertices .",
    "this has undesirable implications in low - energy meson phenomenology . as examples",
    ", we mention the vanishing of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 vertices at some values of the invariant masses of the @xmath10 and @xmath19 , and the difficulties with the @xmath20 vertex @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite , instead of re - defining the fields , preferred to sum the self - energy generated by the  @xmath21 mixing to all orders .",
    "an alternative method in the framework of qhd - iii was recently suggested in @xcite .",
    "this method exploits the freedom in choosing the gauge due to the local gauge invariance .",
    "originally @xcite the so - called unitary gauge was chosen from the beginning , and the two massless isovector goldstone bosons ( we will call them @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) were  gauged away  .",
    "this choice leads to the above - mentioned complication with the mixing .",
    "note that the pseudoscalar boson @xmath23 has the same quantum numbers @xmath24 as the pion @xmath25 originating from glsm sector .",
    "therefore the physical pion field can be chosen as a linear combination of @xmath23 and @xmath25 , while the orthogonal combination is decoupled in the unitary gauge  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian then takes a simpler form , without complicated momentum - dependent vertices .    in the present paper",
    "we apply this new representation of qhd - iii in the calculation of some meson properties .",
    "first , we include the electromagnetic ( em ) interaction in this model .",
    "this is done via an extension of the symmetry of qhd - iii to the local @xmath26 group .",
    "we use an arbitrary gauge where all eight higgs fields are initially present . the em interaction in both sectors of the model",
    "is obtained .",
    "after an appropriate diagonalization of the @xmath23 and @xmath27 fields and fixing the gauge along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the em interaction in terms of the physical pion field .",
    "the final lagrangian includes the minimal em interaction , as well as the ( nonminimal ) em interaction with the intrinsic magnetic moment of the @xmath16 and @xmath15 mesons .",
    "we then study the strong and em decays of the vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "some of the decays can be calculated on the  tree - graph \" level , while others require a calculation beyond the tree level .",
    "in particular , we calculate the width of the following decays : @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 we also address the issue of the width of the scalar @xmath8 meson , in view of the interest @xcite in this subject .",
    "the matrix elements for the above decays are given directly by the corresponding vertices in the lagrangian . in order to calculate the decays @xmath31 and @xmath32 we need to include loop diagrams .",
    "in particular , the @xmath33 process is described by a large number of one - loop diagrams , which can be grouped according to the intermediate state in the diagram .",
    "the diagrams where only vector or axial vector mesons in the loop are present are not yet included in this exploratory study .",
    "all matrix elements of the em processes turn out to be finite , due to a cancellation of divergencies between different amplitudes .",
    "the fulfillment of em gauge invariance serves as a check of the calculation .",
    "the decay widths of these processes are listed in the pdg reviews , and we compare the model predictions with experimental values .    to determine the parameters of the model we fix the strong - coupling constant @xmath34 from the @xmath35 decay .",
    "all other parameters are strongly correlated , once the masses of the particles are taken equal to their experimental values .",
    "only the mass @xmath36  of the @xmath8 meson and the mass @xmath37 of the higgs particles remain unconstrained .",
    "the mass @xmath37 is taken to infinity in the calculation .",
    "as an additional test of the model we calculate the low - energy parameters for @xmath38 scattering . because of some unusual features of the model , such as the presence of higgs mesons and a suppression of the @xmath39 interaction , it is not _ a priori _ clear whether the model can reasonably describe the experiment .",
    "the scattering lengths and effective ranges for the @xmath40 and @xmath41waves are calculated on the tree level and compared with the data and other approaches .",

    "this mechanism of cancellation is similar to that in the linear sigma model , in which the amplitude given by the @xmath8 exchange and the @xmath359 vertex does not diverge in the limit @xmath361 , but rather takes the value dictated by the soft - pion amplitude @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath72 exchange and the associated @xmath359 term at low energies is small .    the pion interaction with hadrons in the model",

    "we included a form factor in the @xmath369 vertex , similarly to what is often done in phenomenological models .",
    "this is one of the effects which contribute beyond the tree level . in this way",
    "the @xmath9 contribution is reduced and the agreement is improved , but other higher - order corrections need to be consistently taken into account before definite conclusions can be drawn .    in this paper we focused on the meson properties and left out the nucleon sector .",
