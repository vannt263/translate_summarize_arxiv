    "quantum walk ( qw ) , which is a generalization of the classical random walk , has attracted a great deal of attention from the scientific community .",

    "interestingly , we note that the marginal distributions on even and odd numbered networks are nearly the same and there is only one peak at @xmath69 .",
    "this feature differs from the case on ordered networks where there are two peaks ( @xmath69 and @xmath65 ) for even @xmath3 and only one peak ( @xmath69 ) for odd @xmath3 .",
    "the two peak marginal distribution on regular even - numbered networks is a consequence of the symmetry of the network topology .",

    "the phase space quasi - probability of wigner function shows various patterns . in the long time",

    "such striped patterns are related to the specific network size @xmath3 and connectivity parameter @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , if the network size @xmath3 is an even number , we find an asymmetric quasi - probability and transition probability between the node and its opposite node .",
