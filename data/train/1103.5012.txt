    "self - seeding schemes have been studied to reduce the bandwidth of sase x - ray fel @xcite - @xcite . in general , a self - seeded fel consists of two undulators with an monochromator located between them .",
    "the first undulator operates in the high gain linear regime starting from the shot noise in the electron beam .",
    "after the first undulator , the output radiation passes through the monochromator , which reduces the bandwidth to the desired value , smaller than the fel bandwidth .",
    "while the radiation is sent through the monochromator , the electron beam passes through a bypass , which removes the electron microbunching introduced in the first undulator and compensates for the path delay created during the passage in the monochromator . at the entrance of the second undulator ,",
    "the monochromatic radiation pulse is recombined with the electron beam , and amplified up to saturation .",
    "the radiation power at the entrance of the second undulator is dominant over the equivalent shot noise power , so that the bandwidth of the input signal is smaller than the bandwidth of fel amplifier .",
    "the self - seeding scheme proposed for the vuv and soft x - ray region makes use of a grating monochromator @xcite .",
    "the presence of such monochromator introduces a path delay with respect to the straight path , which has to be compensated with the introduction of a bypass of the length of about @xmath3 m for the case of the lcls - ii @xcite .",
    "this requires relevant modifications of the baseline .",
    "we recently proposed to use a new method of monochromatization exploiting a single crystal in bragg - transmission geometry for self - seeding in the hard x - ray range @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a great advantage of such transmission geometry method is that it introduces no path - delay of x - rays in the monochromator , thus avoiding the need for a long electron bypass .",
    "all vuv and soft x - ray monochromators operate in the frequency domain as bandpass filters . in this paper",
    "we propose , instead , a new method of monochromatization based on the use a cell containing resonantly absorbing gas in the transmission direction .",
    "such cell works , in analogy with the single - crystal monochromator method for the hard x - ray , as a bandstop filter . then , such problems as extra path - delay of radiation pulse , heat loading and monochromator alignment are solved .",
    "the proposed setup is extremely simple , and composed of two simple elements : a gas cell and a short magnetic chicane , fig .",
    "[ sx5 ] . as for the hard x - ray case ,",
    "the magnetic chicane accomplishes three tasks .",
    "it creates an offset for gas cell installation , it removes the electron micro bunching produced in the first undulator , and it acts as a delay line for the electron bunch .",
    "thus , using a cell with rare gas installed within a short magnetic chicane in the baseline soft x - ray undulator as a bandstop filter , it is possible to decrease the bandwidth of the vuv radiation down to the fourier limit .",
    "we will show that the proposed technique can be implemented in the soft x - ray region , exploiting the tunable - gap soft x - ray baseline undulator .",
    "we propose to first perform monochromatization at @xmath4 nm with the help of the gas - cell monochromator , and subsequently amplify the radiation in the first part the of output undulator .",
    "the amplification process can be stopped at some position well before the fel reaches saturation , where the electron beam gets considerable bunching at the 2nd , 3rd and 4th harmonic of the coherent radiation .",
    "the undulator downstream that position can then be tuned to the harmonic frequency to amplify the radiation further to saturation , fig .",
    "[ sx5 ] .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed study for applying the self - seeding scheme with gas monochromator to the lcls - ii setup , in order to generate narrow bandwidth , soft x - ray radiation in the proposed soft x - ray beam line .",
    "the tentative design for the proposed technique at lcls - ii allows to generate fully coherent radiation at a wavelength of about @xmath5 nm . we focus on the conceptual design , on the technical implementation and on the expected performances of the self - seeding scheme using the gas monochromator .",
    "in this section we illustrate more in detail our novel method of monochromatization , based on the use of a cell containing resonantly absorbing gas .",
    "as already said , this technique takes advantage of the transmission geometry , where no extra path - delay for the radiation pulse is present .",
    "the principle of the new method of monochromatization is very simple and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sx3 ] and fig .",
    "an incident sase pulse coming from the first undulator impinges on the gas cell . when the spectral contents of the incoming sase beam satisfies the photo - absorption resonance condition of the gas , the gas cell actually operates as a bandstop filter for the transmitted vuv sase radiation pulse , see fig .",
    "[ sx4 ] .    obviously , if we use a bandstop filter there is no monochromatization in the frequency domain .",
    "however , the temporal waveform of the transmitted radiation pulse shows a long monochromatic wake .",
    "the duration of this wake is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the absorption line in the transmittance spectrum .",
    "it is then possible to reach a bandwidth limited seed signal by exploiting a temporal windowing technique , as indicated in fig .",
    "since we deal with a high - gain parametric amplifier where the properties of the active medium , i.e. electron beam , depend on time , the temporal windowing concept can be practically implemented in a simple way by delaying the electron bunch at the position where the frequency spectrum of the transmitted pulse experiences a strong temporal separation . in other words , the magnetic chicane in fig .",
    "[ sx5 ] shifts the electron bunch on top of the monochromatic wake created by the bandstop filter . by this , it is possible to seed the electron bunch with radiation pulse characterized by bandwidth much narrower than the natural fel bandwidth .",
    "the concept is similar to that developed in @xcite-@xcite for the hard x - ray case .",
    "however , in the proposed scheme no optical elements are used , and problems with alignment or heat loading do not exist at all . while the radiation is sent through the gas cell , the electron beam passes through the magnetic chicane , which accomplishes three tasks by itself : it creates an offset for the gas cell installation , it removes the electron micro bunching produced in the first ( sase ) undulator and , as already said , it acts as a delay line for the implementation of the temporal windowing .    for the vuv wavelength range , a momentum compaction factor @xmath6 in the order of @xmath7 m is sufficient to remove the microbunching in the electron beam . as a result ,",
    "the choice of the strength of the magnetic chicane only depends on the delay that we need to introduce between electrons and radiation . in our case , this amounts to @xmath7 m , see fig .",
    "such delay is small enough to be generated by a short @xmath8 m long chicane to be installed in place of a single undulator module at a facility like the lcls - ii .",
    "such chicane is , however , strong enough to create a sufficiently large transverse offset of @xmath9 cm for installing the gas cell .",
    "in this article we will take advantage of autoionizing resonances in rare gases .",
    "we consider he , ne and ar as possible choices , presenting cross sections and tables of line parameters .",
    "additionally we will discuss about doppler broadening as an effect , which can be accounted for in this most general level of description .",
    "the phenomenon of autoionization is well - known in literature ( see for example textbooks like @xcite , @xcite and references therein , just as examples of reviews ) . let us consider the helium atom as a case study .",
    "the interaction with a soft x - ray electromagnetic pulse has the effect of ionizing the atom .",
    "a first ionization threshold , where the remaining electron in the ion is found in the state with principal quantum number @xmath10 , is found at @xmath11 ev , while a second ionization threshold with @xmath12 is found at @xmath13 ev .",
    "therefore , after interaction with a photon with energy between these two thresholds , one finds the helium ion in the ground state @xmath14 , and a free electron with kinetic energy equal to the photon energy diminished of @xmath11 ev .",
    "this single open channel can be reached either directly or via decay of a doubly excited state , called autoionizing state .",
    "a set of autoionizing states can be excited at different energies .",
    "if the photon energy increase between @xmath13 ev to @xmath15 ev , not only the previously discussed open channel is possible .",
    "in fact , above the second ionization threshold a second open channel is present , characterized by the helium ion with the bound electron with @xmath12 ( @xmath16 state ) , and free electron energy equal to the photon energy diminished by @xmath13 ev . in this photon energy range",
    "we have a set of autoionizing resonances , which interfere with two open channels ( @xmath14 or @xmath16 ) .",
    "more in general , as the photon energy increases below the double ionization threshold at @xmath17 ev , other channels corresponding to the helium ion with higher numbers of @xmath18 ( @xmath18th ionization threshold ) can be reached .",
    "the autoionizing @xmath19 state corresponds to a double electronic excitation where the two electron principal numbers become @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 .",
    "each choice of @xmath23 corresponds to a set of rydberg series .",
    "dipole transitions allow @xmath24 series of @xmath25 autoionizing @xmath19 states .",
    "these series of resonances admit as a limiting energy the @xmath18th ionization threshold corresponding to the an excited state with quantum number @xmath18 for the @xmath26 ion .",
    "since for a given choice @xmath18 series admits the @xmath18th ionization threshold as a limit , this means that any autoionizing @xmath19 state decays to the @xmath26 state with quantum number @xmath27 .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the series of autoionizing resonances converging to the @xmath28 levels of helium ion .",
    "this means that we have @xmath29 rydberg series , all converging to the second ionization threshold , corresponding to @xmath13 ev .",
    "these three series all begin with the two helium electrons characterized by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which corresponds to an energy of @xmath32 ev .",
    "there are three possible choices for the @xmath33 quantum numbers : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "however , the levels of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 wave functions are nearly degenerate , and the doubly - excited states are better described in terms of constructive and destructive superpositions of these wave functions , finally yielding the three rydberg series : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath36 . since these three series converge ( but no reach ) the second ionization threshold , all the correspondent doubly excited states @xmath19 decay to an helium ion in the ground state . out of these three series ,",
    "only the first @xmath39 will be of interest to us , as the others are too weak .      as we just said , autoionizing resonances results from the decay of doubly excited rydberg states of @xmath19 into the continuum , i.e. @xmath40 . since the continuum can also be reached by direct photoionization , both paths add coherently , giving rise to an interference .",
    "this interference is related with the typical fano line shape for the cross - section as a function of energy @xcite .",
    "a more detailed physical explanation of the entire process of interaction of the fel beam with the gas is given in section [ six ] and [ seven ] .",
    "here we limit to report the cross section for these series , which can be modeled by the expression @xcite    @xmath41    where the energy - dependent background cross - section expressed in megabarn ( @xmath42 ) is given by    @xmath43    with @xmath44 the radiation wavelength in angstrom units , while the reduced energy @xmath45 is defined as    @xmath46    the asymmetry index @xmath47 , the energy of the @xmath48th resonance @xmath49 , the resonance width @xmath50 , have been the subject of several calculations .",

    "the tentative design for the gas monochromator self - seeding technique at the lcls - ii aims at generating fully coherent radiation at about @xmath5 nm . the main parameters for the nominal 5 nm case are listed in table [ tt2 ] in the next section .",

    "it should be noted that the resonance line is about two orders of magnitude narrower ( @xmath57 ) compared with the sase bandwidth ( @xmath58 ) , while the maximum cross section reaches about @xmath59 mb . as a result , attenuation takes place mainly due to the background cross - section , of about @xmath60 mb . recalling that @xmath61 mb is @xmath62 @xmath63 one can confirm the validity of the perturbation theory approach used to calculate the overall transmission function of the gas cell . ] in fig .",

    "these parameters lead to the suppression of the beam modulation by a factor of about @xmath74 .",
