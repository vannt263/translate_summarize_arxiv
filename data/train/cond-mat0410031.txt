    ", coarsening occurs through the irreversible annihilation of domain walls , and the mean domain size grows as @xmath11 .",
    "the coarsening process is equivalent to the diffusion - limited single - species annihilation reaction @xmath12 , where @xmath13 particles represent domain walls .",
    "although no simple particle model can be constructed for kawasaki ( spin - exchange ) dynamics due to the nearest - wall correlations introduced by the conservation principle , qualitatively similar coarsening dynamics kinetics ( but with a different domain - growth law , @xmath14 ) have been observed for spin - exchange .",
    "results have been obtained for the case of non - conserved glauber dynamics for the growth law governing the asymptotic increase of the average domain length @xmath15 and recently even an exact expression for the ` persistence ' exponent @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this exponent regulates the asymptotic decay , @xmath16 , of the persistence probability , which is the probability that a spin has never flipped ( or , equivalently , the fraction of spins which have not flipped ) up to time @xmath7 .",
    "it is a new dynamical exponent , not related to the domain - growth exponent @xcite .    for conserved kawasaki dynamics much less",
    "it has been shown that the average domain length grows algebraically with time as @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 , a consequence of the @xmath19 dependence that emerges at low temperature , from the underlying spin - exchange processes , for the effective diffusion constant of a domain of length @xmath20 .",
    "cornell and bray @xcite have demonstrated that this size - dependence vanishes in the presence of an external driving force .",
    "a calculation of the domain density , @xmath21 , gave @xmath22 as expected for size - independent dynamics .",
    "we will present a similar calculation for the unbiased kawasaki model to obtain an expression for the density which we compare with data from numerical simulations .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "no analytical treatment of the persistence probability exists in the literature for the kawasaki problem .",
    "the only numerical simulation of the system appears to be @xcite where the value of the exponent is measured as @xmath23 .",
    "we have repeated this study for a larger sample of initial configurations to obtain a similar value of @xmath5 , and have also simulated the same system with the general domain - diffusion law @xmath24 for a range of negative , integer @xmath2 .",
    "these models are not realisations of spin - exchange but are nonetheless perfectly legitimate in the domain description and are furthermore closely related to irreversible cluster - cluster aggregation ( dlca ) , another conserved system .",
    "we will show that our numerical values for the dynamic exponent @xmath9 in this generalised kawasaki model match the expression obtained by helen et al .",
    "@xcite for dlca , i.e.   @xmath25 , in the range that we examined .",
    "interestingly , the broken symmetry in cluster - cluster aggregation between the ` filled ' and ` empty ' phases appears to have no effect on the rate of domain growth .",
    "it does , on the other hand , lead to differences between @xmath26 ( where the superscript @xmath27 indicates cluster - cluster aggregation ) and our own numerical data which yield , for @xmath28 , lower limits on @xmath29 in the symmetric spin system .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we examine kawasaki spin - exchange by reducing the dynamics to domain diffusion in a suitable time - frame , and use a scaling hypothesis for the size distribution of domains at time @xmath7 , @xmath30 , to calculate an expression for the domain density in this regime . in section [ persprob ] we present data from simulations of this model which indicate that the persistence exponent @xmath31 .",
    "section [ aggg ] introduces the other conserved system that will concern us , irreversible cluster - cluster aggregation , and contains a comparative treatment of both systems as well as systems with characteristics intermediate between these two models .",
    "we begin by introducing cluster - cluster aggregation and a few useful known results through which the correspondence between kawasaki domain diffusion and aggregation cluster diffusion will be assessed , and continue with an examination of the various exponents for weak ( sec.[gamma1 ] ) and strong ( sec.[gamma2 ] ) size - dependence of the cluster ( or domain ) diffusion constant .",
    "unfortunately , a straightforward reduction to a particle reaction - diffusion system , such as is the case for glauber dynamics and the single - species annihilation process , is not possible for conserved dynamics .",
    "exact mapping is retrieved in the infinite temperature limit , where the walls behave like branching - annihilating fixed particles @xcite , but is rather complicated to follow at any finite @xmath32 . in the low - temperature limit of interest here ,",
    "the simplest description of kawasaki dynamics is in terms of domain diffusion @xcite which we describe briefly below .",
    "the three spin processes that we wish to encapsulate in our higher - level description are :    1 .   @xmath33 ( spin diffusion ) 2 .",
    "@xmath34 ( spin capture ) 3 .",
    "@xmath35 ( spin emission )    where it is clear that capture is just the reverse of emission and hence @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the corresponding rates differ by factors of order @xmath38 so , in the limit @xmath39 , the time - scales for diffusion and emission are widely separated , with capture occurring instantaneously .",
    "implementing spin - exchange dynamics in this way on a ferromagnetic lattice from a random initial configuration leads initially to spin diffusion , followed by the capture of all available isolated spins until the latter disappear from the system .",
    "the rate of capture decays exponentially with time and contributes little towards coarsening , whatever the size - distribution of domains at @xmath40 .",
    "thereafter , the system becomes trapped in a metastable state whose lifetime is extremely long and diverges to infinity at zero temperature @xcite . at any finite temperature",
    ", the metastability can only be broken once a rare splitting event occurs to provide a new isolated spin and even then the system refreezes quickly once the issued spin is absorbed .",
    "spins produced in this way behave like random walkers , initially at @xmath41 , surrounded by two absorbing boundaries at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for a spin emitted into domain of length @xmath20 . the spin is eventually captured by either of the boundaries with probabilities @xmath44 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "absorption at @xmath43 results in the domain , across which the spin has diffused , being moved by one step whereas absorption at the other boundary returns the system to its original configuration .",
    "the combined rate for one step of the domain is @xmath45 and it is this overall motion of the domain that facilitates coarsening close to @xmath46 @xcite .    if @xmath47 is the physical time , in order to observe coarsening in the limit @xmath48 , we must let @xmath49 , while keeping @xmath50 fixed , and consider domain diffusion in rescaled time @xmath51 . in this time variable , the rate of spin emission becomes of order unity , that of domain hops @xmath52 , where @xmath20 is a typical domain size , and coarsening proceeds via domain annihilation induced by the diffusive dynamics of the domains .",
    "the complete set of microscopic spin processes has been reduced to a size - dependent domain diffusion model in time @xmath7 .",
    "certain inconsistencies arise from this size - dependence for @xmath53 , but these ` end - effects ' are negligible as far as the late - time dynamics is concerned ( as is the early - time single - spin regime , which occurs instantaneously in terms of the time variable @xmath7 ) . following the introduction of this coarse - grained model , we calculate the domain density @xmath21 , and conclude the section with a discussion of the persistence probability @xmath54 .",
    "we focus first on the time evolution of the domain density by calculating @xmath21 , the total number of domains per site at time @xmath7 .",
    "the distribution of domain sizes , @xmath20 , at time @xmath7 is given by @xmath30 , the number of domains of size @xmath20 per lattice site .",
    "we expect that asymptotically the latter will be characterised by a single dynamical length scale , the average domain length @xmath55 .",
    "the scaling hypothesis for @xmath56 is : @xmath57 where the form of the prefactor is fixed by magnetisation conservation , since @xmath58 must remain constant .",
    "the @xmath20-dependence of the distribution at small @xmath20 is a measure of the availability of domains near the @xmath59 boundary and dictates the rate of domain extinction .",
    "more precisely , a domain disappears when it has length @xmath60 .",
    "therefore @xmath61 in the continuum limit .",
    "since this rate must be finite , it follows that @xmath62 for @xmath63 . a plot of @xmath64 against @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the mean domain size , confirms the linear small - argument behaviour ( fig.[sc ] ) whereas the same data plotted in the form @xmath67 versus @xmath68 ( fig.[sc2 ] ) shows that the analytic form @xmath69 provides a very good description of the data .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the discussion to the case of non - zero magnetisation per spin @xmath70 .",
    "then the positive ( @xmath71 ) and negative ( @xmath72 ) domains will have different distribution functions @xmath73 .",
    "numerical studies confirm that the form ( [ gaussian ] ) provides a good fit to the data for @xmath71 and @xmath72 separately , but with different scale lengths @xmath74 .",
    "this suggests the scaling forms @xmath75 where @xmath76 is defined such that @xmath77 , and all normalisation factors have been combined in the constants @xmath78 .     against the scaled length @xmath79 from numerical simulations .",
    "both the linear small-@xmath79 and gaussian large-@xmath79 behaviour are reproduced . ]",
    "plotted instead as @xmath80 versus @xmath68 ]    returning to the rate of decay of n(t ) we can write , in the general case , @xmath81 in the above expression we have used the fact that the rate for the elimination of @xmath71 and @xmath72 domains with @xmath60 is given by the mean rate at which @xmath72 and @xmath71 domains diffuse , i.e.   @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "the extra factor of 2 comes from the fact that the elimination of a domain reduces the number of domains by 2 ( since the domains neighbouring the eliminated domains merge ) . for an exact result",
    ", these averages should be taken only over domains adjacent to domains of size @xmath60 . in order to make further progress , we relax this condition and take the average over all domains of a given size .",
    "we are therefore neglecting correlations between domain sizes .",
    "the required averages @xmath84 are given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath21 is the total number of domains per lattice site .",
    "the latter is obtained by adding the contributions @xmath87 and @xmath88 from @xmath71 and @xmath72 domains respectively : @xmath89 where the last equality follows from the condition @xmath90 for all @xmath7 , and holds for all values of the conserved quantity @xmath70 defined as the fraction of spins which have the value @xmath91 ( i.e.  the magnetisation per site is @xmath92 ) .",
    "this quantity satisfies @xmath93 and @xmath94    using eqs .",
    "( [ avll]),([nn ] ) , ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ mmu ] ) we can express @xmath84 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath70 and the integrals @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . putting these into eq .",
    "( [ dndt ] ) and integrating yields the following expression for the domain density : @xmath99 it remains to determine the constants @xmath97 . from the definition of the average domain lengths we find : @xmath100 for the assumed gaussian scaling function @xmath101 , the required integrals give @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the result @xmath105 fixes @xmath106 , giving @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the final expression for n(t ) becomes : @xmath109    , for different volume fractions , @xmath70 , of the @xmath71 phase .",
    "the continuous curves show the analytical prediction given by eqn .",
    "( reffinal ) . ]    in figure [ figmu ] we have plotted eq.([final ] ) for different values of @xmath70 together with numerical data from simulations described in the following subsection .",
    "the agreement is good even at early times , verifying the fast collapse to scaling observed in figure [ sc ] .",
    "note that in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) we used the scaling form ( [ scaling ] ) for all times @xmath7 , not just late times .",
    "this may account for the small discrepancies between theory and data evident at early times in figure [ figmu ] .",
    "it is also evident that the data points lie slightly above the corresponding continuous curves at late times .",
    "nevertheless , the generally good fit of eq.([final ] ) to the data , over a wide range of @xmath70 and with no adjustable parameters , provides good evidence that the assumptions made in its derivation are either correct or at least very good approximations .",
    "principal among these assumptions are the gaussian form taken for the scaling function @xmath76 ( to derive explicit expressions for @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) , the assumption that this scaling function is the same for both domain types , and the neglect of correlations between domain sizes .",
    "to probe the quality of the fit more closely , we extract the amplitude @xmath113 in the asymptotic behaviour @xmath114 for large @xmath7 . for @xmath115 , we find @xmath116 , whereas the analytic form ( [ final ] ) gives @xmath117 , a 7.5% discrepancy .",
    "ben - naim and krapivsky @xcite have given an alternative treatment of the domain - size distribution , making only the assumption that the domain sizes are uncorrelated .",
    "this leads to a slightly better value , 0.415 , for @xmath113 .",
    "however , no results were given for other values of @xmath70 in ref .",
    "our data show that the calculated @xmath113 is smaller than the measured one by about 7.5% for @xmath118 and 0.1 , and by about 5% for @xmath119 .      for the numerical simulations we adopted the domain description of the spin problem , since it is the most appropriate for @xmath120 .",
    "we worked on 1d lattices of size @xmath121 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "all samples were prepared by randomly assigning spins to the @xmath122 sites , although the system can be prepared in any other homogeneous initial state .",
    "the early - time form of the domain size - distribution is irrelevant to the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "updating the persistence probability @xmath54 means tracking the fraction of spins that have not flipped or , equivalently , the fraction of sites that have not been visited by a domain wall up to @xmath7 .",
    "on average , we expect each of the @xmath123 domains to attempt to move by spin emission once per unit time in agreement with the rescaled rates , so a simple monte - carlo algorithm would be to select a domain at random , move it with probability @xmath19 in either direction , where @xmath20 is the its length , and increment time by @xmath124 irrespective of whether or not the domain is moved .",
    "this is indeed the method used in @xcite to infer the value of the persistence exponent , @xmath23 .",
    "unfortunately this algorithm suffers from severe slowing - down in the scaling limit , where the average domain length @xmath66 is much larger than unity and most hopping attempts are unsuccessful .",
    "we worked with a modified version of the domain algorithm which does not exhibit such problems by ensuring that a move is accepted at each computational step .",
    "a normalized vector is constructed for the @xmath123 domains , whose @xmath125 element , @xmath126 , is the probability that domain @xmath127 experiences a hop at time @xmath7 .",
    "for any _ given _ hop this probability is size - dependent only .",
    "incrementing time by @xmath128 , the average time between _ successful _ moves , we end up with the same diffusion rate as in the simpler algorithm .",
    "we avoid , however , the problematic behaviour relating to the inefficiency of the @xmath19 trial .",
    "the disadvantage here is the calculation of the vector @xmath129 at early times , which does result in the simpler algorithm being faster in this regime , but this is a small price to pay .",
    "we show in section [ gamma2 ] that slow convergence to a scaling state in systems with diffusion rates @xmath130 with @xmath131 reinforces the need for the new algorithm .    in figure [ g-1 ]",
    "we present a log - log plot of the persistence probability against time , averaged over 94 realisations . the effective exponent @xmath132 , plotted against @xmath133 in the inset of fig .",
    "refg-1 , seems to saturate at value @xmath134 , the spread around this value beyond @xmath135 being primarily due to poor statistics resulting from the small number of persistent sites remaining at this timescale .",
    "we note that , since @xmath136 is larger than the domain - growth exponent ( @xmath137 ) , the typical distance between persistent sites , @xmath138 , grows faster than the domain length , @xmath139 .",
    "clusters of non - persistent sites , of typical length @xmath138 , grow by the motion of the domain walls at their boundaries .",
    "these motions are uncorrelated since the separation , @xmath138 , of the relevant walls is much larger than the domain scale .",
    "the statistical independence of persistence - destroying processes suggests further that the distribution function , @xmath140 , of the size @xmath141 of non - persistence intervals should decay exponentially , @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the mean size of a non - persistent interval @xcite .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the glauber model , in which the persistence length , @xmath144 , is smaller than the domain scale , @xmath145 , and @xmath140 has a nontrivial form @xcite .    .",
    "the local slope @xmath146 is also given in the inset . ]",
    "in this section we compare the coarsening dynamics of the kawasaki model to that of aggregation models . how would the coarsening properties be modified in the kawasaki ferromagnet for choices of the diffusion exponent @xmath2 other than @xmath1 in @xmath147 ?",
    "furthermore , is the amplitude ratio @xmath148 of the diffusion constants of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 domains relevant to the persistence probability and , if so , will a distinction between ` up ' and ` down ' persistence be necessary ?",
    "we discuss these points with the aid of results from irreversible cluster - cluster aggregation and extensive numerical simulations of modified versions of the kawasaki system . for the rest of the paper we shall use ` kawasaki ' to denote a more flexible model where we allow @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "it must be pointed out , that both @xmath151 and particularly @xmath152 are robust features of kawasaki dynamics , which follow directly from the elementary spin processes .",
    "this follows most strongly from the symmetric nature of the emission process where both an ` up ' and a ` down ' spin are emitted during a single event and consequently @xmath153 is unavoidable .",
    "although it is not possible to reconcile these rules with spin - exchange at the microscopic level , changes in the diffusion exponent and the ratio of amplitudes are easily accommodated in the domain description that we have employed so far .",
    "irreversible cluster aggregation is closely related to kawasaki dynamics .",
    "it , too , involves the separation of a two - phase mixture through domain diffusion and leads to conservation of its respective order parameter , in this case the total mass @xmath154 .",
    "clusters , defined as intervals of consecutive occupied sites , move randomly and coalesce irreversibly on impact , whilst the ` empty ' phase through which the clusters diffuse is immobile ( reversible aggregation scenarios , including various fragmentation mechanisms or monomer ` chipping ' @xcite , can actually result in effective diffusion of the empty phase , and hence partly restore the dynamic equivalence ) .",
    "consequently , this model corresponds to the @xmath155 ` kawasaki ' system .",
    "the diffusion rate for a cluster of length @xmath20 is @xmath156 but we shall concentrate on @xmath157 and particularly on @xmath158 , which correspond to artificial but instructive realizations of domain diffusion on the ising lattice .    due to the broken mobility symmetry between the",
    "` filled ' ( cluster ) and ` empty ' phases , a distinction should be made between the persistence properties of initially occupied sites and initially empty ones .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath159 to denote the persistence probability of empty sites and @xmath160 that of occupied sites with similar notation applying to the corresponding exponents .",
    "only @xmath161 is universal whereas @xmath162 depends strongly on the volume fraction @xmath70 of the ` filled ' phase , which of course remains constant throughout the coarsening process .     to @xmath163 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "the asymptotic slopes are -0.117,-0.136,-0.162,-0.197,-0.248 and -0.332 respectively , in reasonable agreement with the prediction @xmath164 . ]    for negative @xmath2 the exponents governing the algebraic decay of the cluster density and empty persistence probability have been calculated @xcite to be @xmath25 and @xmath165 for the dlca model .",
    "the dependence of the dynamic exponent on @xmath2 is readily obtainable from scaling alone @xcite , an approach whose validity extends to ` kawasaki ' dynamics in view of sec.[domden ] .",
    "if the domain scale is @xmath20 , the time required to develop this scale is @xmath166 , whence @xmath167 . for the empty - site persistence , i.e.   the probability that an initially empty site has not been covered by a cluster up to time @xmath7 , helen et al .",
    "used @xmath168 as a mean - field representation of the cluster kinetics to get @xmath169 , which is known to be exact for @xmath10 .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the persistence of the ` filled ' phase also decays algebraically with a non - universal exponent @xmath170 and that @xmath171 in the half - filled case , @xmath115 , for all @xmath2 .     in logarithmic time , for 3 values of @xmath2 . ]",
    "agreement with simulations of the zero - magnetisation ` kawasaki ' model is very good for the form of the dynamic exponent in the regime @xmath172 ( fig.[wg ] ) . the time required to reach the asymptotic value seems independent of the diffusion exponent @xmath2 ( fig.[twg ] ) , so that all @xmath29 saturate within the numerical window .",
    "the data suggest that domain growth is identical for the limiting cases @xmath155 ( aggregation ) and @xmath153 ( kawasaki ) .",
    "we believe this to be the case in the whole range @xmath173 , given eq.([dndt ] ) and simulations indicating no systematic change in @xmath174 for constant but unequal diffusion coefficients ( fig.[thph0 ] ) .    . we have chosen @xmath175 .",
    "the upper and lower data sets give the persistence and growth exponents , @xmath5 and @xmath9 , respectively ; @xmath176 refers to the persistence of the whole lattice and is obtained from the sum of the two constituent probabilities .",
    "the values of the exponents are consistent with @xmath177 and @xmath178 . ]",
    "let us examine size - independent diffusion ( @xmath10 ) first .",
    "the empty - site persistence probability for @xmath155 reduces to the survival probability of a stationary point surrounded by two random walkers  the near edges of the two domains surrounding the point ( fig.[prpr](a ) ) .",
    "this survival probability is given by the product of the survival probability due to each walker and therefore decays asymptotically as @xmath179 .",
    "similarly , we can interpret filled - site persistence as the survival probability of a random walker with receding boundaries ( fig.[prpr](b ) ) .",
    "the persistent site carries the diffusion of the domain in which it lies , while the edges expand away from it due to domain collisions . for any other @xmath180 the survival of the persistent site involves a mixture of both processes ( fig.[prpr](c ) ) .",
    "although the exact kinetics of individual walls in fig.[prpr](c ) remain unknown , hints as to their form have emerged in many contexts . in a study of annihilating random walks on the infinite half - line @xcite it was shown from numerical measurements that the probability density of the outermost particle is asymmetric . in that case too the trajectory of the outermost walker is a combination of diffusion and directed jumps resulting from particle annihilation , similarly to kawasaki walls .",
    "the probability density curve was found to decay like @xmath181 in the direction of the free interface , but like @xmath182 on the side of the filled lattice , a behaviour which seems to suggest a regime where the diffusion exponential dominates and one where the annihilation exponential does .",
    "this appears reasonable on the basis that the contribution of these irregular hops is super - diffusive , characterised by the domain length distribution from which the jumps are drawn . in studies of the @xmath12 reaction",
    ", this component has indeed been shown to exhibit an exponential form of the kind @xmath183@xcite . unfortunately",
    ", our calculation on a naive convolution of the two components has turned out an overestimate of the persistence exponent in the case where the persistent site is stationary and the probability can be expressed as the product of the two individual capture probabilities , suggesting that correlations between the diffusion and annihilation processes can not be neglected .",
    "as far as numerical simulations of the size - independent system are concerned , we have found that within the accuracy of the statistics , no systematic shift in the values of the exponents takes place in the transition from irreversible aggregation to symmetric diffusion .",
    "it should be noted that the data in fig.[thph0 ] consistently fall slightly above the predicted value @xmath184 . since the exponent is known to be 1 in the limiting cases @xmath153 and @xmath155",
    "@xcite it may be that the numerics have not yet reached the true asymptotic value . nevertheless , even considering this small discrepancy along all values of @xmath180 , @xmath10 remains the only case for which the values of all four exponents match in the limits @xmath155 and @xmath153 .",
    "for kawasaki dynamics ( @xmath185 ) , which we discussed in sec.[persprob ] , a deviation of @xmath5 from @xmath186 is visible and begins to grow as we reduce the diffusion exponent further ( see , sec.[gamma2 ] ) .",
    "the inset in figure [ g-1 ] indicates that @xmath5 saturates asymptotically above the @xmath187 aggregation value , our calculations favouring @xmath188 .      in this parameter range , the aggregation and ` kawasaki ' results for the persistence exponent clearly disagree .",
    "our simulations did not reach , in most cases , the asymptotic regime ( fig.[tpall ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , they demonstrate that the exponents invariably exceed the aggregation prediction @xmath190 .",
    "the very slow convergence we observe has , in fact , also arisen in other studies of aggregation - fragmentation models @xcite , a class to which the ` kawasaki ' model can be shown to relate .",
    "it was noted there , in numerical estimates of the cluster mass distribution function , that for @xmath191 simulations failed to approach a scaling state in the time available .",
    "our own efforts led us in many cases to final configurations where the average domain size was comparable to the lattice size .",
    "we think that for the algorithm employed , good scaling - state statistics would require unfeasibly long runs .",
    "we found no obvious way in which to improve further the performance of the routine which is still limited by the update of the probability vector @xmath192 , although this penalty becomes less relevant at late times .",
    "unfortunately , lattice renormalisation techniques ( such as the one in @xcite ) which have proven successful in other circumstances can not be used in this case as they lead to local violations of the conservation principle .",
    "it is also clear that the collapse onto a single curve encountered in figure [ twg ] at large @xmath7 is absent for the persistence exponent .",
    "this much slower approach to asymptotic behaviour for @xmath5 than for @xmath9 is also consistent with the statement made in sec.[persprob ] that non - persistent intervals and domain lengths have different scaling characteristics .     for @xmath153 ` kawasaki ' systems with negative @xmath2 .",
    "the horizontal lines mark the values @xmath193 predicted for @xmath155 . ]    despite these complications , lower limits for @xmath29 are set by the data , and imply faster - than-@xmath193 decay for @xmath194 in the symmetric system .",
    "this is perhaps surprising in view of the results in the previous subsection , where such a deviation from the @xmath155 behaviour is absent .",
    "we do not know of any argument for the @xmath10 system to constitute a special case , but it is tempting to conjecture that the deviation of @xmath5 from @xmath193 observed for all @xmath131 is monotonic in the intermediate regime @xmath195 .",
    "in this paper we considered an integrated analysis of two - phase conserved systems in one dimension based on two examples : irreversible cluster - cluster aggregation , where only one of the phases is allowed to diffuse , and kawasaki dynamics , where both phases diffuse at the same rate . in terms of the ratio of diffusion amplitudes @xmath180 , the algebraic domain growth at late times has been established as identical in the these two limits , with the ` kawasaki ' dynamic exponent @xmath9 matching the prediction @xmath196 whatever the form of size - dependence assumed for the diffusion rate . in the case of size - independent diffusion , we have also found that this equivalence holds for all other intermediate values of @xmath180 , as was expected given the restrictions on scaling imposed by the conservation principle , i.e.   that the order parameter should remain constant throughout coarsening .",
    "the robustness of this behaviour has been confirmed in a variety of aggregation systems @xcite .    by contrast , in the critical @xmath115 limit considered , changes in the relative mobility of the two phases lead to different persistence characteristics .",
    "the transition from irreversible aggregation to symmetric diffusion is accompanied by severe slowing - down in the convergence rate of the effective persistence exponent to its asymptotic value as well as a distinct shift from the simple @xmath26 result for all negative @xmath2 .",
    "we have been able to show that the disagreement , which is at zero @xmath2 absent in the whole range @xmath197 , always leads to faster persistence decay for the symmetric system , with numerical data indicating a possible lower bound for the exponent at @xmath198 @xmath199 .",
    "apart from the slow convergence to asymptotic behaviour which hinders any definitive results as far as the value of @xmath5 in the symmetric limit is concerned , it is also possible that , for size - dependent cluster dynamics and finite values of @xmath180 , @xmath54 deviates from the simple power - law behaviour observed in irreversible aggregation . in this latter case",
    ", it seems that the filled persistence ( the persistence of the mobile phase ) is non - universal and decays as a power - law only for @xmath115 @xcite . since single - site persistence for @xmath200 involves a mixture of both the empty- and filled - site behaviour , it is possible that the resulting probability is also non - universal .",
    "a further prospect which must be considered is the possibility of inferring @xmath5 in the more strongly size - dependent systems from the scaling properties of the size - distribution of non - persistent sites .",
    "the general characteristics of this scaling are dictated by the fact that @xmath201 , which constrains the tail of the non - persistent interval size - distribution to a known form @xcite .",
    "hints of this behaviour have been suggested by our results for the probability @xmath54 , since the regularity encountered in the collapse of the growth exponent onto the aggregation result for different @xmath2 is lost in plots of @xmath5 . instead , a very slow saturation of the local persistence exponent has been observed extending , in all cases but @xmath185 , well beyond @xmath202 .",
