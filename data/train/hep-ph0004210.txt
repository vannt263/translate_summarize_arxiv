    "the soft - breaking terms in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) need to have a very special form for the model to be viable .",
    "generic mass matrices for the squarks and sleptons lead to unacceptably rapid flavor - changing and lepton - number - violating processes .",
    "similarly , the tri - linear soft - breaking breaking a - terms also require fine tuning for the mssm to agree with experiment .",
    "it is important to explore models which naturally solve the flavor fine - tuning problem .",
    "the rates for flavor - changing processes induced by the soft masses are proportional to the ratios of the off - diagonal mass squares to the diagonal ones . in order to make such ratios",
    "small one needs to minimize the off - diagonal terms or increase the flavor - preserving masses .",
    "examples of natural scenarios are gauge mediation @xcite and anomaly mediation @xcite , which produce diagonal mass matrices due to the universality of the gauge coupling , and effective supersymmetry  @xcite , which postulates large soft masses for the first two generations , for which the experimental constraints are most stringent .",
    "the popular minimal supergravity  @xcite model does not contain a solution to the flavor problem , instead one simply assumes that the higher - dimensional operators which produce the scalar masses are flavor preserving .",
    "it has been noticed that in `` gaugino - dominated '' models the flavor problem is less severe  @xcite .",
    "if at a high scale gaugino masses are larger than other soft parameters at that scale , then at low energies the soft masses consist of large flavor - conserving masses with smaller flavor - violating components .",
    "this is because the renormalization group running induces ( positive ! ) universal soft scalar masses proportional to the gaugino masses .",
    "the generated scalar masses are flavor universal because couplings to gauginos are generation - independent .",
    "the most appealing gaugino - dominated scenarios have no soft masses for squarks and sleptons and no a - terms at a high scale @xmath0 .",
    "since at the high scale there are no masses and no a - terms , the only sources of flavor violation are the yukawa matrices , thus the supersymmetric flavor problem is solved by a `` super - gim '' mechanism  @xcite .",
    "gaugino domination also alleviates the supersymmetric cp problem because the only sources for new phases are the gaugino masses , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "two phases can be rotated away by field re - definitions , leaving only one possible new phase .",
    "for the special case @xmath3 the supersymmetric cp problem is solved automatically .",
    "in fact , the special boundary conditions with vanishing superpartner masses and a - terms are theoretically well motivated .",
    "they arise , for example , in no - scale supergravity  @xcite or in the recently constructed higher - dimensional `` gaugino mediation '' models  @xcite . in gaugino mediation the mssm matter fields",
    "are confined to a brane in higher dimensions .",
    "supersymmetry is assumed to break on a distant parallel brane .",
    "extra dimensional locality forbids direct couplings between the two branes and thereby suppresses all soft masses which involve mssm matter fields ( squark and slepton masses , a - terms ) .",
    "gauge fields and gauginos propagate in the bulk and couple directly to supersymmetry breaking , allowing for the generation of gaugino masses .",
    "extra - dimensional locality only forbids scalar masses at energies large compared to the compactification scale @xmath0 . at long distances",
    "the theory is four - dimensional and masses are generated from renormalization as usual .",
    "the compactification scale in gaugino mediation corresponds to a free parameter .",
    "gauge coupling unification motivates us to choose @xmath4 , and an upper limit on @xmath0 is given by the length scale at which nature becomes non - local , presumably the string scale or planck scale . in no - scale",
    "supergravity the scale @xmath0 at which soft scalar masses vanish is related to the string scale . in the following",
    "we will treat @xmath0 as a free parameter subject to the constraint @xmath5 , and refer to the boundary condition of vanishing scalar masses and a terms as gaugino mediation .",
    "clearly this scenario is very appealing and it is crucial to ask if it is phenomenologically viable . for the particular choice of @xmath6 one finds that the stau is the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) which is problematic because the calculated relic abundance of stable staus exceeds experimental limits by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this observation is often conceived as a failure of no - scale models and has motivated construction of models with new fields at intermediate scales to modify the renormalization group equations . in this paper",
    "we repeat the analysis for general @xmath7 and find the good news that the problematic stau - lsp is very special to @xmath8 . for compactification scales",
    "slightly higher than @xmath9 the stau mass gets a large new contribution from running in the unified theory above @xmath9 which lifts its mass above the mass of the bino .",
    "this results in a very satisfying cosmological picture with a bino - lsp .",
    "usually , the renormalization above the gut scale is ignored ( see , however , refs .",
    "there are two seemingly good reasons for this negligence , we find that both are invalid .",
    "the first reason given is that @xmath10 is negligibly small compared to @xmath11 .",
    "however , we find that the smallness of the logarithm is compensated for by much larger group theory factors which arise in gut theories .",
    "in particular , the right - handed sleptons receive only very small contributions from running below the gut scale because they carry only hypercharge , but above @xmath9 they are unified into a much larger representation with large corresponding group theory factors .",
    "the second reason is that the renormalization group equations above @xmath9 are necessarily model - dependent .",
    "obviously , guts have more fields than just the mssm multiplets and the adjoint field needed to break the gut symmetry to the standard model gauge group .",
    "for example , there must be additional multiplets that guarantee the splitting of the doublet and triplet higgs fields .",
    "all such new gut - scale fields appear with model - dependent susy couplings .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply that the running of all soft parameters above the gut scale is model dependent .",
    "as we will demonstrate in gaugino mediation most of the soft masses decouple from the unknown physics and many predictions can be made in a model - independent fashion .    in the next two sections we describe the renormalization group analysis above ( section  [ abovegut ] ) and below ( section  [ belowgut ] ) @xmath9 in detail .",
    "we find that the number of model - independent predictions that can be obtained is related to the form of the boundary conditions at @xmath0 .",
    "general gaugino mediation boundary conditions allow arbitrary soft higgs masses  @xcite , a b - term and gaugino masses at the scale @xmath0 .",
    "we show that in this case the spectrum of the first two generations and the ratios of gaugino masses can be predicted .",
    "when only @xmath12 and @xmath2 are non - zero at @xmath0 one can also predict third generation scalar masses . finally , when @xmath2 is also set to zero one obtains the boundary conditions of minimal gaugino mediation  @xcite . in this case",
    "the entire superpartner spectrum can be predicted in terms of just two parameters : @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the renormalization of soft mass parameters above the grand unification scale , which we take to be @xmath13 gev .",
    "we first briefly summarize the situation in a general susy - gut with soft masses and then turn to gaugino dominated scenarios such as gaugino mediation or no - scale supergravity .",
    "we assume that there is a direct coupling of supersymmetry breaking to the gauginos . then the ( one - loop )",
    "`` anomaly mediation '' @xcite contributions to superpartner masses are always negligible .",
    "a realistic gut theory requires a number of new fields above the gut scale for breaking the gut symmetry , splitting the higgs doublets and triplets , and possibly also for generating flavor .",
    "there exists a large number of different proposals for addressing all these problems , but unfortunately present day experiments do not allow us to single out a unique `` gut standard model '' .",
    "not knowing the exact spectrum and couplings above the gut scale makes it impossible to perform a reliable renormalization group calculation of all superpartner masses above the gut scale",
    ". a conservative approach would then be to parameterize our ignorance by assuming general non - universal but gut - symmetric superpartner masses at @xmath9 . to simplify and to avoid conflicts with experimental bounds on",
    "flavor violation one often assumes that the soft parameters are approximately flavor symmetric .",
    "this approximation can be poor for third generation scalar masses which can be significantly modified because of the large yukawa couplings .",
    "however , the first and second generation yukawa couplings are presumably small also above @xmath9 and can therefore be neglected in the running .",
    "then the one - loop renormalization of the soft scalar masses for the first and second generation depends only on the unified gauge coupling and is flavor - universal .",
    "it is therefore possible to compute the running of these soft masses and one can make predictions if they are known at some high scale .",
    "the results of this running are well - known @xcite .      in gaugino - dominated scenarios the situation is different . in gaugino domination",
    "one assumes that the scalar masses as well as the tri - linear soft terms vanish at some high scale @xmath0 , and their low - energy values are generated from the renormalization group .",
    "thus at the scale @xmath7 the non - vanishing mass parameters are the universal gaugino mass @xmath12 and the supersymmetry preserving and violating higgs mass parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , one could also have soft masses for the higgs fields , but for the time being let us assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are zero at @xmath0 .    as we will see below",
    ", @xmath1 does not enter any renormalization group equation for the soft terms neither above nor below @xmath9 .",
    "since we do not have a physical principle which tells us the value of @xmath1 at the high scale , this means that there is no need to run the value of @xmath1 . in the phenomenological analysis",
    "we simply work with its low - energy value .",
    "@xmath2 also does not enter any renormalization group equations .",

    "<S> we compute the superpartner masses in a class of models with gaugino mediation ( or no - scale ) boundary conditions at a scale between the gut and planck scales . </S>",
    "<S> these models are compelling because they are simple , solve the supersymmetric flavor and cp problems , satisfy all constraints from colliders and cosmology , and predict the superpartner masses in terms of very few parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis includes the renormalization group evolution of the soft - breaking terms above the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the running above the gut scale is largely model independent and find that a phenomenologically viable spectrum is obtained .    </S>",
