    "one of the greatest successes of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( ) has been the characterization of the sources creating the 0.58 kev cosmic background ( cxrb ) , and the deepest  surveys form a central part of this effort .",
    "the two deepest  surveys , the  deep field - north and   deep field - south ( and , jointly cdfs ; see @xcite for a review ) , have each detected hundreds of sources over @xmath15  arcmin@xmath16 areas with enormous multiwavelength observational investments .",
    "they have measured the highest sky density of accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) to date and have also enabled novel x - ray studies of starburst and normal galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies , large - scale structures in the distant universe , and galactic stars .    as part of an effort to create still deeper surveys",
    ", we proposed for substantial additional exposure on the during   cycle  9 .",
    "the has superb and improving coverage at optical , infrared , and radio wavelengths ; it will continue to be a premiere multiwavelength deep - survey field for the coming decades as additional large facilities are deployed in the southern hemisphere .",
    "furthermore , owing to the 1  ms of  exposure already available ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g02 ) , the is a natural field to observe more sensitively .",
    "although our proposal was not approved in the peer review , subsequently 1  ms of director s discretionary time was allocated for deeper observations .",
    "the allocated observations were successfully executed in 2007 september , october and november , raising the exposure to @xmath17  ms and improving its sensitivity to be comparable to that of the ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a03 ) .",
    "additional sky coverage at such flux levels is critically important as it substantially improves the statistical sample sizes of the faintest x - ray sources and also allows a basic assessment of the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "furthermore , approximately doubling the exposure on previously detected sources substantially improves the constraints on their positions , spectral properties , and variability properties .    in this paper",
    ", we present up - to - date  source catalogs and data products derived from the full @xmath17  ms data set along with details of the observations , data processing , and technical analysis .",
    "detailed subsequent investigations and scientific interpretation of the new sources will be presented in future papers , e.g. , studies of heavily obscured and compton - thick active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , high - redshift agns , agn spectra and variability , starburst and normal galaxies , and clusters and groups of galaxies . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations and data reduction , and in  3 we present the main and supplementary point source catalogs and describe the methods used to create these catalogs . in  4 we estimate the background and sensitivity across the survey region .",
    "we also present basic number - count results for point sources in  5 .",
    "we summarize in  6 .",

    "the consists of 23 separate observations described in table  [ tbl - obs ] . the @xmath21  ms catalogs for the first 11 observations taken between 1999 october 14 and 2000 december 23 were presented in g02 and a03 .",
    "note that observation 581 ( 1999 october 14 ) was excluded from the data reduction and is not listed in table  [ tbl - obs ] due to telemetry saturation and other problems . the second @xmath21  ms exposure consisted of 12 observations taken between 2007 september 20 and 2007 november 4 .",
    "the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer imaging array ( acis - i ; @xcite ) was used for all of the  observations .",
    "the acis - i is composed of four @xmath22 pixel ccds ( ccds ) , covering a field of view of @xmath23 ( @xmath7285 arcmin@xmath16 ) , and the pixel size of the ccds is @xmath7@xmath24 .",
    "the focal - plane temperature was @xmath25c for observations",
    "1431 - 0 and 1431 - 1 , and @xmath26c for the others .",
    "the 12 new observations were taken in very faint mode to improve the screening of background events and thus increase the sensitivity of acis in detecting faint sources @xcite .",
    "the background light curves for all 23 observations were inspected using event browser in the tools for acis real - time analysis ( tara ; @xcite ) software package . aside from a mild flare during observation 1431 - 0 ( factor of @xmath27 increase for @xmath28  ks ) , all data sets are free from significant flaring , and the background is stable within @xmath720% of typical quiescent _ chandra _ values . after filtering on good - time intervals and removing the one mild flare , we are left with 1.911  ms of total exposure time for the 23 observations .    because of the differences in pointings and roll angles for the individual exposures , the total region covered by the entire is 435.6 arcmin@xmath29 , considerably larger than the acis - i field of view .",

    "chandra _ point spread function ( psf ) , and to apply a modified bad - pixel file as detailed below .    one important deviation from the standard _",
    "chandra _ reduction procedure outlined by",
    "the cxc is implementation of a stripped - down bad - pixel file .",
    "we note that the standard bad - pixel file supplied with all _ chandra _ data currently excludes @xmath7 67% of the total effective area on front - illuminated devices ( e.g. , acis - i ) .",
    "a large fraction of the bad - pixel locations identified in this file , however , appear to be flagged solely because they show a few extra events ( per ms ) almost exclusively below 0.50.7 kev .",
    "good events with energies above 0.7  kev that fall on these bad pixels are likely to be perfectly acceptable for source searching , as well as for photometry and spectral analysis albeit with a few mild caveats regarding misinterpretation . rather than reject all events falling on such columns , we instead adopted a procedure to only exclude events below a row - dependent energy of 0.50.7 kev .",
    "ms data set .",
    "we found that such `` hot '' soft columns were not clearly seen in any individual observations .",
    "the upper energy bound appears to vary as a function of distance from the readout edge of the front - illuminated ccds , such that rows closest to the readout edge only have extra events below @xmath70.5  kev , while those furthest away have extra events extending up to @xmath70.7  kev . ] to this end , we generated a stripped - down bad - pixel file , only selecting obvious bad columns and pixels above 1  kev ; this excluded @xmath32 of the total effective area on front - illuminated devices .",
    "once the entire @xmath0  ms data set was combined , we isolated `` hot '' soft columns as those where the total number of events with energies below 0.7  kev was 5@xmath33 or more above the mean .",
    "we then rejected any events in those columns that fell below a row - dependent 0.50.7  kev ; this removed 1% of all events .    through inspection of the data in ccd",
    "coordinates , we additionally discovered that the cxc - preferred ciao tool acis_run_hotpix failed to flag a substantial number of obvious cosmic - ray afterglows ( @xmath34100200 per observation , depending on exposure length ) , elevating the overall background and , in egregious cases , leaving afterglows to be mistaken as real sources .",
    "this problem appeared to be worse for faint mode data , presumably because the additional @xmath35 screening applied in very faint mode rejects the strongest afterglows @xcite .",
    "to remedy this situation , we reverted to using the more stringent acis_detect_afterglow algorithm on all of our data .",
    "notably , none of our sources has a count rate high enough that acis_detect_afterglow would reject true source counts , which we verified by inspection of events flagged by this routine .",
    "even acis_detect_afterglow failed to reject all afterglows , and thus we created custom software to remove many remaining faint afterglows from the data . working in ccd coordinates , we removed additional faint afterglows with three or more total counts occuring within 20  s ( or equivalently 6 consecutive frames ) .",
    "in total , we removed 229 total events associated with afterglows . in all cases , we inspected the data set and found that such flagged events were isolated and not associated with apparent legitimate x - ray sources .",
    "the production of the point - source catalogs largely followed the procedure described in  3 of a03 .",
    "the main differences in the catalog - production procedure used here are the following :    1 .",
    "our main  catalog includes sources detected by running wavdetect @xcite at a false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath36 , less conservative than the 10@xmath37 value adopted by a03 .",
    "even with this revised threshold , we expect the fraction of false sources to be small ; see  3.2 for details .",
    "additional sensitivity can be obtained by merging the @xmath38  ks extended  deep field - south (; @xcite , hereafter l05 ) with the @xmath0  ms .",
    "an additional 86 sources were detected with this approach .",
    "these sources are presented in a supplementary catalog described in  3.3.2 .",
    "we registered the observations in the following manner .",
    "wavdetect was run on each individual cleaned image to generate an initial source list .",
    "centroid positions for each detected source were determined using the reduction tool acis extract ( ae ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were registered to a common astrometric frame by matching x - ray centroid positions to optical sources detected in deep @xmath10-band images taken with the wide field imager ( wfi ) of the mpg/ eso telescope at la silla ( see  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the matching was performed using the ciao tools reproject_aspect and wcs_update adopting a 3@xmath39 matching radius and a residual rejection limit of 06 ; 50100 sources were typically used in each observation for the final astrometric solution .",
    "the tool wcs_update applied linear translations ranging from 005 to 034 , rotations ranging from @xmath40 to 0009 , and scale stretches ranging from 0.999563 to 1.000714 ; individual registrations are accurate to @xmath703 .",
    "all of the observations were then reprojected to the frame of observation 2406 , since this data set required the smallest translation to align it with the optical astrometric frame .",
    "we constructed images using the standard  grade set (  grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) for three standard bands : ( full band ; fb ) , ( soft band ; sb ) , and ( hard band ; hb ) .",
    "figure  [ fbimg ] shows the full - band raw image .",
    "exposure maps in the three standard bands were created following the basic procedure outlined in  3.2 of @xcite and were normalized to the effective exposures of a source located at the average aim point .",
    "briefly , this procedure takes into account the effects of vignetting , gaps between the ccds , bad - column filtering , bad - pixel filtering , and the spatially dependent degradation in quantum efficiency due to contamination on the acis optical - blocking filters .",
    "a photon index of @xmath41 was assumed in creating the exposure maps , which is approximately the slope of the background in the band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show the full - band exposure map in figure  [ fbemap ] . using the full - band exposure map ,",
    "we calculated the survey solid angle as a function of the minimum full - band effective exposure ; the result is plotted in figure  [ emapcum ] .",
    "approximately 56% and 42% of the field has a full - band effective exposure greater than 1  ms and 1.5  ms , respectively , with a maximum effective exposure of @xmath42  ms ( note this is slightly smaller than the 1.911  ms total exposure since the aim points of all the  observations were not exactly the same ) .",
    "the survey solid angles are comparable to those of the @xmath0  ms ( a03 ; dashed curve in fig .  [ emapcum ] ) .",
    "adaptively smoothed images were created using the ciao tool csmooth on the raw images .",
    "exposure - corrected smoothed images were then constructed following  3.3 of @xcite .",
    "we show in figure  [ clrimg ] a color composite of the exposure - corrected smoothed images in the 0.52.0 kev ( _ red _ ) , 24 kev ( _ green _ ) , and 48 kev ( _ blue _ ) bands .",
    "source searching was performed using only the raw images , while many of the detected sources are shown more clearly in the adaptively smoothed images .",
    "point - source detection was performed in each of the three standard bands with wavdetect using a `` @xmath43  sequence '' of wavelet scales ( i.e. ,  1 , @xmath43 , 2 , @xmath44 , 4 , @xmath45 , 8 , @xmath46 , and 16 pixels ) . the criterion for source detection is that a source must be found with a given false - positive probability threshold in at least one of the three standard bands . for the main  source catalog discussed in  3.3.1 , the false - positive probability threshold in each band was set to @xmath47 .",
    "if we conservatively consider the three images searched to be independent , @xmath718 false detections are expected in the main  source catalog for the case of a uniform background .",
    "however , this false - source estimate is conservative , since a single pixel usually should not be considered a source - detection cell , particularly at large off - axis angles ( wavdetect suppresses fluctuations on scales smaller than the psf ) . as quantified in  3.4.1 of a03 ,",
    "the number of false - sources is likely times less than our conservative estimate .",
    "we also provide additional source - significance information by running wavdetect using false - positive probability thresholds of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these results are presented in @xmath503.3.1 , which can be utilized to perform more conservative source screening if desired .",
    "the source lists resulting from the wavdetect runs discussed in  3.2 with false - positive probability threshold of @xmath47 were merged to create the main point - source catalog presented in table  [ tbl - mcat ] , which consists of 462 point sources .",
    "whenever possible , we have quoted the position determined in the full band ; when a source is not detected in the full band , we used , in order of priority , the soft - band position or hard - band position . for cross - band matching , we used a matching radius of @xmath51 for sources within @xmath52 of the average aim point and @xmath53 for larger off - axis angles .",
    "these matching radii were chosen by inspecting histograms showing the number of matches obtained as a function of angular separation ( e.g. , see  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the mismatch probability is @xmath54 over the entire field .",
    "a few mismatches near the edge of the field were removed through visual inspections .",
    "we improved the wavdetect source positions using the centroid and matched - filter positions generated with ae .",
    "the centroid is simply the mean position of all events within the ae extraction region , while the matched - filter position is the position found by correlating the full - band image in the vicinity of each source with a combined psf .",
    "the combined psf is produced by combining the `` library '' psf of a source for each observation , weighted by the number of detected counts .",
    "this technique takes into account the fact that , due to the complex psf at large off - axis angles , the x - ray source position is not always located at the peak of the x - ray emission .",
    "the wavdetect , centroid , and matched - filter techniques provide comparable accuracy on - axis , while the matched - filter technique performs better off - axis .",
    "we chose the matched - filter positions as our default , and then visually inspected each source . when the adopted position appeared to deviate from the apparent center of the source by more than 01 , we modified the position manually such that it was visually consistent with the apparent center .",
    "we refined the absolute source positions by matching the sources in the main  catalog to the wfi @xmath10-band optical sources ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "there are @xmath55 optical sources across the field , which have accurate positions with positional error @xmath56 .",
    "we selected relatively bright optical sources with ab magnitudes @xmath57 ( @xmath58 sources ) , and matched them to the sources using a 2@xmath595 matching radius .",
    "there are eight cases where one source has two optical counterparts .",
    "the @xmath10-band magnitudes of the two counterparts differ by less than one in all cases , and thus we selected the closer one as the most - probable counterpart .",
    "we also visually inspected the optical counterparts and , for purposes of positional checking , only keep those sources that are point - like or slightly extended ; ten extended sources were removed . under these criteria ,",
    "229 sources have bright optical counterparts .",
    "we estimated the expected number of false matches by manually shifting the source coordinates in right ascension and declination by @xmath60 ( both positive and negative shifts ) and recorrelating with the optical sources . on average ,",
    "the number of false matches is @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , and the median offset of these false matches is @xmath71@xmath5971 . by comparing the and optical source positions",
    ", we found small shift and plate - scale corrections .",
    "these corrections have been applied to the positions of all the sources in the main and supplementary catalogs , resulting in small ( @xmath63 ) astrometric shifts .",
    "we investigated the accuracy of the source positions using these 229 detected bright optical sources .",
    "figure  [ dpos ] shows the positional offset between the sources and their optical counterparts as a function of the off - axis angle .",
    "the median offset is @xmath70@xmath5936 .",
    "however , there are clear off - axis angle and source - count dependencies .",
    "the off - axis angle dependence is due to the degradation of the  psf at large off - axis angles , while the count dependence is due to the difficulty of finding the centroid of a faint source .",
    "simulations have shown that the offsets of wavdetect positions appear to increase exponentially with off - axis angle and decrease with the number of source counts in a power - law form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on figure  [ dpos ] and taking into account the probability of false matches , we derived an empirical relation for the positional uncertainties of the sources in our sample , which is @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the positional uncertainty in arcseconds , @xmath66 the off - axis angle in arcminutes , and @xmath67 the source counts in the energy band where the source position was determined .",
    "we set an upper limit of 2000 on @xmath67 as the positional accuracy does not improve significantly beyond that level .",
    "positional uncertainties for @xmath68 , 200 , and 2000 are shown in figure  [ dpos ] .",
    "the stated positional uncertainties are for the @xmath69 confidence level , and are smaller than the wavdetect positional errors , especially at large off - axis angles , because of our positional refinement described above .",
    "a few sources in figure  [ dpos ] have unexpectedly large positional offsets ; they could be false matches .",
    "counts and a positional offset of @xmath70 in figure  [ dpos ] is source `` 289 '' in the main  catalog ( see table  2 ) .",
    "this source does not have any optical counterpart after adopting a more appropriate matching radius , as shown in the catalog .",
    "] there is also the possibility that a few of them are off - nuclear sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ poshist ] shows the distributions of the positional offsets in four bins of different x - ray positional uncertainties , as well as the expected numbers of false matches assuming a uniform spatial distribution of the @xmath57 optical sources .",

    "the total background includes contributions from the unresolved cosmic background , particle background , and instrumental background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for our analyses we are only interested in the total background and do not distinguish between these different components .",
    "the mean background count rates are @xmath149@xmath150 higher compared to the @xmath0  ms ( a03 ) or the @xmath8  ks ( l05 ) , which are reasonable variations given the variability of the particle and instrumental background components over the past several years .",
    "the faintest sources in the main  catalog have @xmath28 counts in the soft band and @xmath151 counts in the hard band ( see table  [ tbldet ] ) . for a @xmath152  1.4 power law with galactic absorption ,",
    "the corresponding soft - band and hard - band fluxes at the average aim point are @xmath153  and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "this provides an estimate of the ultimate sensitivity of this survey .",
    "however , these numbers are only relevant for a small area close to the average aim point . to determine the sensitivity across the field it is necessary to take into account the broadening of the psf with off - axis angle , as well as changes in the effective exposure and background rate across the field .",
    "following l05 , we estimated the sensitivity across the field by employing a poisson model , the resulting relation can be approximately represented by    @xmath155    where @xmath156 is the required number of counts for detection , and @xmath157 is the number of background counts in a source cell ; @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 are fitting constants . for the sensitivity calculations here , we measured the number of background counts @xmath157 in the background maps using an aperture size of 70% of the psf encircled - energy radius .",
    "the 70% encircled - energy radius was chosen as a compromise between having too few source counts and too many background counts .    following equation ( [ eqsen ] ) , we constructed sensitivity maps using the background and exposure maps , assuming a @xmath152  1.4 power - law model with galactic absorption .",
    "since we do not filter out detected sources with our sensitivity maps , a small fraction of sources have fluxes slightly below these sensitivity limits ( 4 sources in the full band , 14 sources in the soft band , and 7 sources in the hard band ) .",
    "the full - band sensitivity map is shown in figure  [ senmap ] , and in figure  [ senhist ] we show plots of solid angle versus flux limit for the full , soft , and hard bands . the @xmath71  arcmin@xmath16 region at the average aim point has soft - band and hard - band sensitivity limits of @xmath3  and @xmath4 , respectively .",

    ", we took a similar approach to the one in @xcite and created 200 monte carlo simulated observations in both the soft and hard bands .",
    "we added simulated sources at random positions to the background maps described in  4 .",
    "the fluxes of these simulated sources were drawn randomly from the total number - count models of @xcite between @xmath163 and @xmath164  in the soft band and @xmath165 and @xmath164  in the hard band .",
    "these fluxes were converted to photon counts using the exposure maps and a photon index of @xmath41 .",
    "statistical errors were added to the counts to account for the effect of eddington bias .",
    "finally , counts for each simulated source were added to the background map following a psf probability distribution function derived from the combined model psf of the nearest real x - ray source in the main catalog .",
    "these model psfs were produced using ae .",
    "source searching and photometry were performed on the simulated images using the same method as that used to produce the main catalog . a completeness correction factor ( @xmath166 )",
    "was estimated by comparing the number of simulated input sources with the number of simulated detected sources as a function of detected counts . a flux recovery correction factor ( @xmath10 )",
    "was calculated by comparing the simulated input counts with simulated measured counts .",
    "the correction factors are position- and count - dependent . for each of the 462 x - ray sources in the main catalog",
    ", we determined the two correction factors based on a sample of simulated sources within @xmath167 of the source position and having similar exposure times .",
    "sources close to the edge of the survey field are not well sampled , and thus we calculated cumulative number counts using only the 428 x - ray sources that are located within @xmath168 of the average aim point .",
    "the completeness and flux recovery corrections remain close to unity above @xmath3450100 counts . below this point , s varying psf size and spatially dependent vignetting begin to affect source detection and photometry .",
    "we set our minimum flux levels to @xmath169  in the soft band and @xmath170  in the hard band .",
    "these limits were chosen since at lower fluxes there are less than 1015 additional sources contributing to the number counts , and thus the number counts at fainter levels have large uncertainties .",
    "the cumulative number of sources , @xmath162 , brighter than a given flux , @xmath171 , weighted by the appropriate aerial coverage , is @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the maximum solid angle for which a source with flux , @xmath174 , could be detected .",
    "each flux @xmath171 has been corrected for flux bias assuming @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the original flux quoted in the main catalog .",
    "the maximum solid angles were computed using the inner @xmath168 radius regions of the sensitivity maps .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath73 errors for the cumulative distributions following gehrels ( 1986 ) .",

    "soft - band number counts mainly comes from the difference in the count - rate  to  flux conversion factor used in these two surveys .",
    "was used to calculate fluxes in @xcite , while in this survey , the photon index was estimated for each source separately and so was the count - rate  to  flux conversion factor ( see  3.3.1 ) .",
