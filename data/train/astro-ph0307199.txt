    "in an attempt to account for the coplanar nature of the orbits of all known solar - system planets , laplace ( 1796 ) postulated that they were formed in a common disk around the protosun .",
    "today , the detection of protostellar disks around most young t - tauri stars ( prosser _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) is a strong evidence that the laplace nebula hypothesis is universally applicable .",
    "the recent discovery of planets around at least 10% of nearby solar - type stars ( marcy _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) suggests that their formation may be a robust process .",
    "conventional cosmogonical scenarios are based on the assumption that heavy elements in gas - phase condensed to form grains which then coagulated into planetesimals and grew into protoplanetary cores which can accrete , at least in some regions of the disk , massive gaseous envelopes around themselves ( pollack _ et al .",
    "the coexistence of gas and solid ice has been detected in some protostellar disks ( thi _ et al .",
    "in fact , protostellar disks are most conspicuous in their continuum radiation associated with the re - processing of stellar light by the grains ( adams , lada , & shu 1987 ) .",
    "the apparent wavelength dependence in the thickness of the disk dust layer has been interpreted as evidence of grain growth ( throop _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , dalessio _ et al . _ , 2001 , clarke _",
    "et al . _ , 2003 ) and settling ( shuping _ et al . _ , 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath0m - to - cm continuum radiation signatures of the dust are observed to fade on the timescale of a few myr ( beckwith , 1999 , haisch _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , signaling the depletion of grains in this size range .",
    "this suggests that heavy elements initially contained in this size range are either evaporated , ejected to large distance , accreted onto the host stars , or have coagulated into larger particles .",
    "the first possibility is constrained by the concurrent decline in the co - gas ( zuckerman _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) whereas the last possibility is directly relevant to the process of planet formation",
    ".    theoretical analysis suggests a very strong constraint on the growth of @xmath0m - size grains into km - size planetesimals .",
    "indeed , the orbital evolution of the particles is determined by both the gravity of the central star and the drag of the disk gas . in the absence of turbulence",
    ", the disk gas attains a dynamical equilibrium between gravity , pressure , and centrifugal forces with zero velocity in both radial and normal - to - the - disk directions and a slightly sub - keplerian velocity in the azimuthal direction .",
    "particles in the disk undergo both sedimentation toward the mid - plane and inward drift in the radial direction ( whipple 1972 , weidenschilling 1977 ) . in a minimum mass nebula ( hayashi _",
    "_ 1985 ) , the resulting orbital decay timescale at 1au ( for instance ) is smallest for m - size particles ( adachi _ et al .",
    "_ 1976 ) , and is then less than about @xmath1 yr .",
    "unless the growth of planetesimals across this `` most vulnerable size '' can occur faster than their orbital decay , there would be no residual planetesimals left to provide the building blocks of planets .",
    "one possible channel of rapid grain growth is through sedimentation into a sufficiently thin , gravitationally unstable disk ( goldreich & ward 1973 ) .",
    "the critical thickness for gravitational instability of such disks is less than @xmath2 of their radii and the characteristic size of the resulting fragment is @xmath3 a few km .",
    "however , even a modest amount of turbulence can provide adequate stirring to prevent the sedimentation of grains into such a thin unstable layer ( weidenschilling 1984 , supulver & lin 2000 ) . though turbulence is likely to occur in a magnetized disk ( balbus & hawley , 1990 ) through magneto - rotational instability",
    ", this mechanism could well fail in regions of the disk where the ionization fraction is too small . in these regions only , the following alternative mechanism for turbulence has been proposed .    in a laminar disk ,",
    "the sedimentation of dust toward the disk s mid - plane leads to a local concentration of massive particles ; these particles entrain the gas to a near - keplerian velocity through drag , thereby introducing a shear layer between the dust - dominated mid - plane and the rest of the disk gas ( weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) .",
    "such a flow pattern in the disk has the potential to cause the onset of a shearing instability ( sekiya 1998 , youdin & shu 2002 ) .",
    "however , the stability analysis used by these authors for such flow is based on a single - fluid approximation in which the dust particles are assumed to be well - coupled to the gas .",
    "since the concentration of the dust particles not only causes the shear but also a stabilizing density stratification , the flow of dust and gas should be treated separately . in a companion paper ( garaud _",
    "_ in preparation ) , we will carry out a two - component stability analysis of the disk s dust layer .    such a study is greatly simplified by the treatment of the particles as a separate fluid rather than a collection of particles .",
    "it is with this goal in mind that we now present a system of averaged equations for the evolution of a collection of dust particles in the form of moments of the boltzmann equation .",
    "this prescription could also in principle be applied for the studies of dust particles evolution due to coagulation , sublimation , condensation ( supulver & lin 2000 ) and under their interaction with embedded planets ( wyatt _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) and stellar radiation ( takeuchi & artymowicz 2001 , klahr & lin 2001 , takeuchi & lin 2002 ) .    for the present calculation",
    ", we assume the particles are collisionless and indestructible spheres in a gaseous laminar disk with no embedded planets and negligible stellar radiation . in this paper",
    ", we also neglect the feedback of the particles drag on the motion of the gas . in  2 , we recall the general gas drag laws and their effects on particle trajectories in a protoplanetary accretion disk . in  3 , and  4",
    "we solve for individual particles orbits , and derive the complementary set of dynamical equations for a collection of particles in the form of low - order moments of the boltzmann equation ( boltzmann , 1872 ) . in  3 ,",
    "we focus only on small particles , which have sizes smaller than the mean - free - path of the gas molecules , whereas in  4 , we develop analogous equations for particles with sizes larger than the mean - free - path of gas .",
    "these initial calculations are purely analytic ; in order to perform them , we need to assume separation of the radial and normal - to - the - disk variables , as well as a constant background gas density . in  5 , we check the validity of these assumptions with a complete numerical calculation of the particles orbits in a simple - to - use model for the gas nebula .",
    "we compare both the results for individual orbits and for the moments ( typically , the average velocity and average velocity dispersion ) obtained from the boltzmann averaging procedure .",
    "we also consider the spatial and temporal evolution of a given size - distribution of particles in  6 and show that particles with a narrow selected size - range sediment most rapidly toward the mid - plane .",
    "finally in  7 , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall the effect of gas drag and gravitational forces on individual particle trajectories .      in dust - particle number - density regimes where particle collisions are negligible , the trajectory of a particle is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 denote derivatives of @xmath6 with respect to time , @xmath7 is the position vector of the particle , @xmath8 is the externally imposed gravitational potential , @xmath9 is the mass of the particle and @xmath10 is the drag force between the particle and the gas .",
    "the amplitude of the drag force depends on the size of the particle @xmath11 compared to the mean free path of the gas @xmath12 and one typically distinguishes two regimes , @xmath13 ( epstein regime ) and @xmath14 ( stokes regime ) .    in the small particle limit , _",
    "i.e. _ the epstein regime , the drag is caused by the thermal agitation of the gas and is proportional to the velocity of the particle relative to the gas : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gas velocity , @xmath17 is the local density of the gas , @xmath18 is the local sound speed and @xmath19 is the solid ( i.e. internal ) density of the particle . in a standard solar nebula ,",
    "this formula is typically valid up to decimeter - sized particles at 1 au .    in the other limit",
    ", large particles see the gas as a fluid , and experience a drag force through the laminar or turbulent wake that they create as they move through the gas .",
    "this is the stokes regime .",
    "whipple ( 1972 ) reported that the drag force on a sphere is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the norm of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the particle reynolds number of the flow ( @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the molecular viscosity of the gas ) .",
    "experimental results suggest that the drag coefficient @xmath26 varies like @xmath27 this prescription ensures a smooth transition between the epstein regime and the stokes regime for intermediate particle sizes ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "note that in the stokes regime ( for @xmath29 ) , the amplitude of the drag force depends on the total velocity of the particle with respect to the gas , and not simply its component parallel to the particle s velocity .",
    "this expresses the fact that a strong wake caused by the particles motion in one direction also affects even the slightest motion in another perpendicular direction .",
    "as particles undergo gas drag , they lose angular momentum which causes them to drift slowly inwards . for particles",
    "strongly coupled to the gas ( i.e. very small particles ) , this drift is slowed down by the support provided by the gas pressure itself . for weakly coupled particles ( i.e. very large particles ) ,",
    "the angular - momentum loss is very small and the drift is equally slow ( see the next section ) .",
    "there exists an intermediate regime , however , where orbital decay can occur very rapidly .",
    "weidenschilling ( 1977 ) carried out a first quantitative study of the effect of the gas drag on particles of various sizes , and determined the inward drift velocity as a function of particle size .",
    "he found that the maximal drift occurs for particles for which the typical stopping timescale @xmath30 is of order of the orbital timescale @xmath31 , and decays very quickly for particles much larger , or much smaller than that .",
    "as a result , unless the particle is of intermediate size , there will be a marked separation between the dynamical timescale and the orbital decay timescale .",
    "moreover , there is also a marked separation between radial and vertical length scales ; indeed , numerical integration of the orbits of particles in a gaseous disk shows that the typical radial drift velocity is of the same order ( in the case of small particles ) or much smaller ( in the case of large particles ) than the vertical settling velocity ( see section [ sec : numint_traj ] ) .",
    "hence in a thin disk the particles settle to the mid - plane with very little radial excursion , then undergo radial decay within a very thin dust layer . for this reason it is justified to assume that the vertical motion of particles is more or less independent of their radial motion ( although not of their radial _ position _ ) , and that their radial motion occurs mostly at @xmath32 . since weidenschilling ( 1977 ) has already derived an analytical description of the particles motion in the radial direction , we shall concentrate on the problem of vertical settling .",
    "a short derivation of the case of radial and azimuthal motion of the particles in a gas disk is presented in the appendix for completeness .",
    "from the previous sections , we infer the vertical equation of motion of a small dust - particle in the epstein regime : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the height above the disk . in a central potential ,",
    "the gravitational force close to the mid - plane can be rewritten as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the keplerian angular velocity at the radius considered .",
    "we re - normalize the time variable to the orbital timescale @xmath37 at the radial position considered , and the distances to astronomical units ( au ) ; we deduce the non - dimensional equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 . in terms of this normalization",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath0 in this regime is typically much larger than unity , which means that the stopping time @xmath40 is much smaller than the orbital time .",
    "the solution to equation ( [ eq : epseq ] ) is straightforward , and the trajectory of a particle initially positioned at height @xmath41 with initial velocity @xmath42 is @xmath43 \\mbox { .    }",
    "\\label{eq : epstraj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for @xmath44 this expression simplifies to @xmath45 the second term of this expression describes the rapid deceleration of the particle by the gas drag , the first represents a slow settling toward the mid - plane .",
    "let us recast this equation into @xmath46 which defines the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 uniquely .",
    "the instantaneous vertical velocity of these particles is then given by @xmath49 note that for @xmath50 ( which describes the intermediate parameter range between the epstein regime and the stokes regime ) the particle motion contains an oscillatory component decaying exponentially on timescale @xmath51 .",
    "given a set of particles at initial positions @xmath41 and with initial velocities @xmath52 , the boltzmann distribution function of these particles is @xmath53 one can also take the continuum limit of this description in the case of a very large number of particles : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the initial particle density distribution , and @xmath56 is the initial velocity distribution of particles .",
    "the freedom in the relative choices of the initial distribution functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 is lifted by requiring that for all @xmath41 @xmath57    the mass density of the particles is obtained by integrating @xmath58 over all possible velocities : @xmath59 substitution of the equations for the particle trajectories into ( [ eq:1 ] ) and integration over all possible initial positions yields @xmath60    the first moment of the boltzmann function is the average vertical velocity : @xmath61 the same manipulations yield @xmath62    let us assume for a short while that the distribution of the initial velocities is independent of height above the mid - plane .",
    "then we can verify easily that the quantities determined above in equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) satisfy the standard continuity equation @xmath63 regardless of the form of the `` trajectory functions '' @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , the original collisionless boltzmann equation ( boltzmann , 1872 ) describes the evolution of the distribution function @xmath58 in phase space through @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a collision term that reproduces the interaction of the particles with themselves and with the surrounding medium .",
    "if we integrate the boltzmann equation with respect to the velocity space , we get @xmath66 substitution of the equation of motion equation ( [ eq : epseq ] ) into the last term of the left - hand - side provides an expression for the interaction term @xmath65 as a condition for the mass continuity equation to be satisfied : @xmath67 this result can be generalized in the case where @xmath56 depends on @xmath41 .",
    "subtracting the mass continuity equation from the first moment of the boltzmann equation reveals the importance of the particle velocity correlations @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the particles velocity dispersion function .",
    "this equation is very similar to that of a standard fluid , with the following caveats : ( i ) it contains an explicit drag term in the form of @xmath71 , and ( ii ) the very last term , which usually represents the pressure term in a standard fluid , must be written explicitly as a function of known quantities .",
    "we expect this term to be null in the case of collisionless particles with negligible relative velocity with respect to the gas ; in order to double check this conjecture , we now evaluate @xmath72 explicitly .",
    "let us first evaluate @xmath68 : @xmath73    the behavior of @xmath72 at short times ( i.e. for times shorter than the stopping time @xmath74 ) is difficult to extract analytically while keeping the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 unprescribed .",
    "however , for large @xmath0 and large times one can simplify the expressions for the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 to @xmath75 in that case , the expressions for the first and second velocity moments simplify largely to @xmath76 and one can show that provided @xmath56 is an even function of velocity @xmath77 this result is expected : any initial velocity dispersion is quickly damped out by the surrounding gas on the short stopping timescale @xmath78 .",
    "note that in the case where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are uniformly distributed , this expression is also valid for very short times .",
    "the long - term evolution of the collection of particles becomes a slow collective settling , on a timescale @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in the epstein case , one can approximate the particles as a fluid with a linear drag force and zero pressure .",
    "the main drag effect of the gas on a large particle occurs through the formation of a wake behind the particle .",
    "if the velocity of the particle relative to the gas is small enough , the wake is laminar and the drag force is a linear function of the relative velocity . in that case",
    ", the particle trajectory is actually the same as that obtained in the case of the epstein regime , and the results of the previous section apply . however , as the relative velocity between the particle and the gas increases , the wake becomes turbulent and the amplitude of the drag force becomes a power law of the particle s reynolds number .    as a result , though the component of the drag force in any direction is still proportional to the relative velocities of the particle and the gas in that same direction , its amplitude also depends on the total relative velocity of the particle with respect to the fluid .",
    "hence the vertical component of the drag force is : @xmath79 if one assume the only important component of the gas velocity is in the azimuthal direction .",
    "this formula can in principle be used only in conjunction with a complete evaluation of the particle s orbit .",
    "however , one can assume that the largest typical contrasts in velocity between particle and gas occurs in the vertical direction , where the particles oscillate across the mid - plane with an epicyclic frequency whereas the gas is more - or - less stationary ( so that @xmath80 and @xmath81 )",
    ". in that case , the expression for the vertical component of the drag force reduces to @xmath82    note that since the typical velocity of the particles across the mid - plane is of order of @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the typical height of particles above the disk , the asymptotic stokes regime occurs for particles of size @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "this condition corresponds for example to 10 m size particles at @xmath87 au and @xmath88th of the disk scale height in a standard solar nebula .      using the same normalizations as in the epstein regime , the particle s vertical equation of motion",
    "can then be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 au . in the asymptotic stokes regime",
    ", @xmath26 is simply a constant , and @xmath92 is typically of order of unity , or smaller .",
    "this equation can be solved exactly through the introduction of the quantity @xmath93 . on the positive branch (",
    "when @xmath94 ) and negative branch ( @xmath95 ) the solutions are , respectively , @xmath96 as the particle oscillates about the mid - plane , it follows one branch or the other .",
    "the constants @xmath97 and @xmath98 are determined by matching the first branch to the boundary conditions and the successive alternative ones to each other at the turning point ( i.e. when @xmath99 ) . for instance , the trajectory of a particle starting from rest at @xmath100 above the mid - plane satisfies the equation @xmath101 it accelerates toward the mid - plane , then decelerates on the other side until it reaches a turning point @xmath102 which satisfies @xmath103 these solutions indicate the existence of two regimes . when the initial height @xmath104 is much larger than the scale height @xmath40 the turning point",
    "@xmath102 is roughly equal to @xmath105 regardless of the height from which it originated .",
    "this pattern corresponds to a rapid stopping phase , when the particle quickly drops toward the mid - plane .",
    "when the amplitude of @xmath104 is reduced much below @xmath40 , the turning point @xmath102 is roughly equal to @xmath106 , which corresponds to the oscillatory phase , when the particle follows an epicyclic motion about the mid - plane with a slowly decaying amplitude .",
    "the stopping phase corresponds to the limit where @xmath34 is much larger than the scale height @xmath40 .",
    "note that this situation may not always occur since in the stokes regime , @xmath107 .",
    "this condition corresponds to particles which start at a considerable distance above or below the disk itself .",
    "nonetheless , in this case the solutions simplify to : @xmath108 ( for the downward branch ) and this differential equation can easily be solved with @xmath109 note that the particle velocity in that case varies linearly with time : @xmath110 so that the typical duration of the settling phase is @xmath111",
    ". finally , we also note that for a particle starting from @xmath104 above the disk , for example , the lower turning point is more or less independent of @xmath104 and is roughly equal to @xmath112 .",

    "moreover the frequency of the oscillation also varies with time , and converges to the epicyclic frequency .    to recapitulate briefly",
    ", we find that after a brief stopping phase on a timescale proportional to @xmath126 , the particle oscillates around the mid - plane with frequency which is close to the epicyclic frequency , and with an amplitude that decays slowly in time roughly as given by equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "these solutions are illustrated in figure [ fig : veloc ] .",
    "the true particle trajectory in the asymptotic stokes regime can not be expressed analytically in any simple way . as in the epstein case",

    "note that integration for much longer times ( about 1000 orbits ) reveals a small but growing discrepancy in the amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "this is due to the mis - representation of the analytical expression for the amplitude of the drag force compared to its true value ( see equations ( [ eq : realf ] ) and ( [ eq : badf ] ) ) .",
    "this discrepancy is discussed in more detail later .      in this section",
    ", we now follow the evolution of a collection of 10,000 uniformly sized particles , in the epstein regime ( of size 1 mm ) and in the stokes regime ( with size 10 m ) .",
    "we release all particles from a small interval in radius , for @xmath183 .",
    "the initial radial positions are uniformly distributed in that interval .",
    "other initial conditions depend on the regime studied , in order to be best able to perform the adequate comparisons between theory and numerical experiment . after a time @xmath156 ,",
    "the particles positions and velocities are gathered , and binned into regular intervals in radius and in height . the total number of particles , the average velocity and the average second velocity moment are then calculated for each bin according to the formulae : @xmath184 where the sums are carried out over all particles found within the individual bin centered on the position @xmath185 .",
    "when comparing the numerical data to the analytical solutions of the previous sections , we are careful to apply the correct normalization to the analytical formulae : indeed the normalization of the time variable depends on radial position in the analytical solutions , whereas in the numerical computations , it is normalized to the orbital frequency at 1au .      using the normalizations adequate to the numerical calculations , the theoretical solutions for the average particle velocity and dispersion becomes @xmath186 figure [ fig : stateps1 ] shows the very short time evolution of a collection of 10,000 mm - size particles released with a uniform distribution in heights in the interval @xmath187 $ ] au and a uniform distribution in velocities with @xmath188 ( in units of the keplerian velocity at @xmath87 ) .",
    "for this figure , the binning in the averaging process is fairly coarse ( 10 bins in each direction ) in order to generate adequate statistics and to visualize the results more clearly .",
    "the velocity dispersion is indeed found to decay exponentially in accordance with equation ( [ eq : epscomp ] ) .",
    "the trajectory of these particles are then followed up to time @xmath189",
    "( i.e. about 16 orbits ) and their average velocity is computed with a finer binning ( 50 bins in each direction ) .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig : stateps2 ] , and compared to the analytical solutions in equation ( [ eq : epscomp ] ) . once again in this regime , the analytical solutions are found to match the numerical results very precisely .      in the asymptotic stokes regime , particles oscillate across the mid - plane with an algebraically decaying amplitude",
    ". theoretical analysis of the particles trajectories and velocities shows the velocity dispersion should remain important at all times .    in order to simplify the comparison between the analytical solutions in section [ sec : sto ] and the full numerical results , we begin by releasing 10,000 10m - size particles in the disk with similar initial conditions as the ones that were used in the analytical work .",
    "though these initial conditions may seem perhaps artificial , they are the only ones that actually provided any analytical solution .",
    "we specify the initial values @xmath190 where @xmath129 is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath191 $ ] .",
    "the azimuthal velocity of the particles is the keplerian velocity at the point of release .",
    "we choose these initial values in order to simulate a set of particles released with a large range of velocities and heights above the mid - plane .",
    "the gravitationally bound particles converge toward the mid - plane during the settling phase , and continue to oscillate coherently across the mid - plane with a random phase but roughly all the same slowly decaying amplitude .",
    "the simulation is then started at @xmath123 when all the particles have an oscillation amplitude @xmath192 , the corresponding velocity as given by equation ( [ eq : initzw ] ) with a random phase . in that case , using the same normalization we adopted in our the numerical simulations , we find the theoretical solutions for the velocity dispersion to be @xmath193 figure [ fig : statsto ] compares the results of the numerical calculations to the theoretical solutions given by equation ( [ eq : stopred ] ) . for relatively short time after the onset of the calculation , the numerically obtained dispersion is indeed extremely well approximated by the analytical formula . however , over much longer times , a systematic shift emerges , in which the numerical values are slightly lower than the theoretical solutions .",
    "this slight overestimate of the velocity dispersion comes from the fact that the analytical solutions underestimate the total drag force by neglecting the contributions from the particles motion in the radial and azimuthal direction . in order to verify this conjecture ,",
    "another numerical experiment is carried out in which the drag force is artificially set to @xmath194 in that case , the contribution of the drag force in the vertical direction is exactly that used in analytical calculation . as expected",
    ", the analytical expression is now able to reproduce the experimental results much more accurately .",
    "having gained some experience with the boltzmann averaging methods , and having moreover established the adequacy of the analytical approximations to the particles trajectories in the stokes regime , we now attempt to use the results of the numerical simulations to find the evolution of the particles dispersion in the case where the initial conditions are chosen randomly ( rather than in such a way as to allow easy analytical calculations ) . in the follow up numerical computation ,",
    "10,000 10m - size particles are released with a uniform initial height and vertical velocity distribution chosen in the intervals @xmath187 $ ] au and @xmath187v_{\\rm k}(r)$ ] .",
    "the azimuthal velocity of the particles is set to be the keplerian velocity at the point of release . with these initial conditions",
    ", the initial velocity dispersion should be uniform within the dust layer .",
    "figure [ fig : storand ] shows the evolution with time of this dispersion profile at radius @xmath87 au , when the particles are binned in 20 intervals in radius and heights . after a brief adjustment phase ( not shown in the figure ) , the dispersion profile seems to be well approximated by a gaussian distribution .",
    "we attempt to match such a gaussian profile to the numerical data points , and find that the best fit is given by @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "this formula was obtained from the following heuristic arguments : according to the formula for the particles vertical motion ( see equation [ eq : stotraj ] ) , the typical vertical velocity of the particles near the mid - plane is of the order of @xmath197 , where @xmath84 is the maximum height of the particles above the mid - plane .",
    "moreover , @xmath84 decays with time due to gas drag according to equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) , so that one can readily deduce the evolution of @xmath197 for a set of particles released at @xmath123 from typical heights ranging between 0 and @xmath198 .",
    "the numerical factors have been fitted to the data .",
    "the analytical fit is also shown in figure [ fig : storand ] , and is found to reproduce the evolution of @xmath155 satisfactorily .",
    "finally , recalling that the analytical expression for the particles vertical motion slightly underestimates the true drag force , we compare the analytical fit given by equation ( [ eq : sigmafit1 ] ) to an artificial simulation in which the drag force is given by equation ( [ eq : fakef ] ) . in principle , the fit should be much better in this case .",
    "however , we find that the evolution of the dispersion in that case is better fitted by @xmath199 whilst keeping the expression for @xmath197 the same ( see figure [ fig : storand ] ) .",
    "though this difference is small , it still suggests that any attempt to find an analytical fit to the collective motion of stokes particles should be carefully calibrated before being used in further simulations .    to conclude this section , it was found that the analytical evaluation of one particle s orbit was extremely useful toward the determination of the collective motion of a large number of particles , and that the resulting averaged equations fit the numerical experiments extremely well .",
    "we have also been able to determine a simple heuristic way of closing the moments equations at low order in the case of particles in the stokes regime , which emulates the effect of the particles dispersion by a mock pressure term that _ can _ be related to large - scale properties ( and initial conditions ) of the fluid .",
    "having discussed the time - evolution of a large number of particles of equal size , we now consider a population of different - size particles .",
    "again , the boltzmann approach proves useful and simple to use .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that for a given size , and at a given radius , the _ initial _ particles to gas mass ratio is independent of @xmath34 .",
    "hence the initial distribution of particles of a given size @xmath11 at time @xmath123 is @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the typical gas disk height ; for an isothermal disk , @xmath202 .",
    "let us also assume ( again for simplicity ) that the initial vertical velocity of particles is null .",
    "this idealized _ ad hoc _ setup could correspond to a condensation front where , at time @xmath123 , both hydrogen and heavy elemental gas diffuses into a cool region of the disk .",
    "the condensation and sublimation time scales are generally much shorter than the dynamical time scales ( supulver & lin 2000 ) so that , at least the small grains may form with a similar density distribution as the gas and without any initial in - falling motion .",
    "the coexistence of large and small particles well above the mid plane requires runaway coagulation of initially steady , microscopic dust grains into grains up to a size @xmath11 .",
    "this rapid _ in situ _ growth is possible in regions where the particles have large surface density and much greater than unity area filling factor because the particles collision and growth time scales are short compared with their dynamical time scale .",
    "the particles then start settling from their initial positions , and interact with the gas mostly with an epstein drag law .",
    "the particles density distribution at time @xmath156 is then simply : @xmath203 where @xmath47 is defined by equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) , and @xmath204 is the evolving dust layer thickness .",
    "this equation was derived from ( [ eq:3 ] ) using the ansatz ( [ eq:6 ] ) and @xmath205 .",
    "we can deduce from this result the number distribution of particles of size @xmath11 @xmath206 where we have defined the constant @xmath207 such that @xmath208 in order to write explicitly this equation in terms of its dependence on the particle size .",
    "the initial particle size distribution function is taken to be that given by hellyer ( 1970 ) and mathis _ et al . _",
    "( 1977 ) @xmath209    at a given height above the disk , this distribution function peaks for small particle sizes ( which corresponds to the initial peak in @xmath210 ) , but has another maximum , which evolves with time , at approximately @xmath211 regardless of the initial size distribution function of the particles .",
    "this result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nheight ] .",
    "these results shown in figures [ fig : ntime ] and [ fig : nheight ] suggest the following comments .",
    "firstly , at a given height , successive fronts of particles with decreasing sizes pass through the gas as they settle , to leave the region completely depleted of the intermediate sized particles . secondly , at a given time , there is a definite stratification of the particles in terms of their respective sizes , with the larger particles concentrating tightly around the mid - plane .",
    "note that this method is only valid for particles with sizes up to the order of the mean - free - path of the gas .",
    "for the very large particles , the stokes drag law must be applied . in that case , we have shown in section [ sec : sto ] that the large particles only settle algebraically toward the mid - plane . as a result , although their number density is small , the large particles remain important at all times and at all heights in the disk .",
    "this work shows that after a few settling times ( which are of the order of a few thousands of orbits for cm - sized particles ) , the bulk of the disk will be depleted of intermediate sized particles , which have all settled down to the mid - plane .",
    "there remains , at all heights , very small particles that have not had time to settle , and very large ones which are in a phase of oscillation around the mid - plane .",
    "in this paper , we provide a set of analytic solutions to describe the sedimentation of dust particles due to gas drag in a protostellar accretion disk .",
    "the main effect of the gas drag is to induce a loss of angular momentum and linear momentum for the particle , which in turn leads to orbital decay and vertical settling .",
    "numerical integration of the particles trajectories in a protoplanetary accretion disk is straightforward if we assume that the gas flow is laminar and occurs mostly in the azimuthal direction .",
    "however , analytical integration is also possible given a set of assumptions ( which have been checked here to be reasonably well justified ) , including the separability of the radial and vertical motion , and locally uniform density .",
    "accordingly , we have extracted analytical formulae for the vertical motion of particles in a disk , both in the epstein regime ( for particles with size much smaller than the mean - free - path of the gas molecules ) and in the stokes regime ( for particles much larger than the mean - free - path ) .",
    "comparison of these analytical expressions with the complete numerically integrated orbits shows an excellent match in both cases .    by using the analytical expression for the particles orbits",
    ", we were able to extract their average behavior using a standard boltzmann analysis ( i.e. local averaging , or rather , coarse - graining , of the particles positions and velocities in phase space ) .",
    "the successive moments of the boltzmann distribution function provide the evolution of the coarse - grained particle density , velocity and velocity dispersion .",
    "the successive moments of the boltzmann equation yield the equivalent of `` fluid '' equations for the collection of particles , and in particular a mass conservation equation and a momentum equation .",
    "numerical experiments were performed in which 10,000 single - size particles were released in the disk from a localized region of phase - space ( typically uniformly distributed in space and with a uniform vertical velocity distribution ) . using a similar coarse - graining method as the one used in the analytical analysis , we were able to extract the particle density profile , their average velocity and velocity dispersion from the numerical integration .",
    "we compared them to the analytical formulae obtained previously .",
    "the main results are summarized here .    in the epstein regime",
    ", there is an excellent agreement between the analytic formulae and the results of the numerical calculation .",
    "individual particles have their velocity with respect to the gas quickly damped out on a very short stopping timescale .",
    "correspondingly , their collective behavior is coherent : the typical velocity dispersion is found to decay on the particle stopping timescale , which is usually much smaller than the orbital timescale . for times longer than the stopping timescale",
    ", individual particles settle exponentially toward the mid - plane and the corresponding average momentum equation reduces to a simple standard fluid equation with a linear drag term , and null pressure .    in the stokes regime , there is a good agreement between the theory and the results of the numerical experiments .",
    "individual particles are found to oscillate across the mid - plane with an algebraically decaying amplitude .",
    "although this behavior is very well reproduced by the analytical work , there exists a small discrepancy between analytical formulae and the results of numerical computation in the form of a slight systematic overestimate of the particles oscillation amplitude .",
    "this problem is due to an ( unfortunately unavoidable ) over - simplification of the amplitude of the drag force in the analytical work , and results in similar discrepancies in the comparison of averaged quantities .",
    "nonetheless , apart from this small identifiable and controllable error , the predictions of the analytical work match very well the numerical results .",
    "as expected , the particles velocity dispersion is found to remain large at all times within the dust layer , with a maximum near the mid - plane .",
    "this large dispersion is directly related to the continuous oscillatory motion of the particles across the mid - plane .",
    "we found it extremely difficult to obtain analytical predictions of the temporal evolution of the dispersion for anything but the simplest initial conditions - which were not necessarily always realistic .",
    "however , we were able to deduce from the numerical experiments a heuristic fit to the observed evolution of the particles dispersion , for more general initial conditions .",
    "this result has interesting consequences with respect to the possibility of closing the moments equations at low order , and describing accordingly the evolution of a collection of large particles with averaged fluid equations .",
    "we will test this theory in future work .",
    "finally , by combining the average evolution equations for single - size particles obtained in the epstein regime to a plausible size - distribution function for dust - grains in the ism ( hellyer , 1970 , mathis _ et al . _ , 1977 ) , we showed that it is possible to follow analytically the spatial and temporal evolution of such a size - distribution as the particles settle toward the mid - plane .",
    "this analytical calculation was done for collisionless particles , and the extension of this work to include collisions , coagulation and sublimation would probably require numerical analysis .",
    "nonetheless , within this approximation we found that the sedimentation process results in a very strong segregation of particles according to their sizes , within a timescale of a few hundreds of years only .",
    "all intermediate - size particles quickly converge to the mid - plane , leaving behind only the very small particles , indirectly supported against the settling by gas pressure , and the very large particles , which keep oscillating across the mid - plane with a slowly decaying amplitude .",
    "this segregation process may well suggest that within the very thin dust layer at the mid - plane , one could approximate the population of dust particles by a single - size population .    in future work , we shall apply the results obtained here to two essential purposes :    * the description of the particles as a continuum fluid will be used to study the stability of the dust layer against shearing ( garaud _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) , in order to test whether gravitational instability can indeed take place in the dust layer .",
    "more generally , we intend to implement this description into existing 3d hydrodynamics codes for the computation of accretion disks , in order to obtain a fully self - consistent description of dust evolution and growth in these disks ; * the temporal and spation evolution of the size - distribution of particles can be compared directly with observations of dust .",
    "we plan to construct models with which we can infer the extent of particle coagulation and infer the surface density distribution of the gas from high resolution , multi - wavelength ( mostly in the sub - mm and mm range ) maps of protostellar disks .",
    "pascale garaud thanks new hall ( cambridge ) and pparc for financial support towards the completion of this work .",
    "it was also supported in part by nasa through grant nag5 - 10612 and the california space institute .",
    "the authors thank neil balmforth and taku takeuchi for many useful discussions .",
    "neglecting the vertical motion of the particles , the equations of motion in the radial and azimuthal directions in the epstein regime are @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the slightly sub - keplerian azimuthal velocity of the gas @xmath214 which defines @xmath215 . as in section 2.3 , we use the normalizations @xmath216 = r = 1 $ ] and @xmath217 = { \\omega_{\\rm k}}^{-1}(r)$ ] to obtain @xmath218    it is not possible to find simple analytical solutions of the full system .",
    "however , we can assume that deviations from keplerian motions are small , and that the particle velocity can be written as @xmath219 the linearized system yields ( assuming that the background quantities vary very little with @xmath176 ) @xmath220 substituting the first into the second yields @xmath221 hence the local solution is @xmath222 this solution represents the local difference between the particle velocity and the keplerian velocity , in units of the keplerian velocity . as in the solution found in section [ sec : sto ] , the first term represents a very quick stopping of the particle on timescale @xmath40 and the second term represents a constant inward drift .",
    "the variation of this drift velocity with particle size is given by the function @xmath223 which has a maximum for @xmath224 .",
    "this result reproduces the results found by weidenschilling ( 1977 ) .",
