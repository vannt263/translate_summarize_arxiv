    "it is generally believed that @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) pairing is important in nuclei with roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons @xcite .",
    "the standard technique for treating these correlations is through the bardeen cooper schrieffer ( bcs ) or hartree fock bogolyubov ( hfb ) approximation , generalized to include the @xmath6 pairing field in addition to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 pairing fields @xcite .",
    "questions arise , however , as to whether these methods can adequately represent the physics of the competing modes of pair correlations , without full restoration of symmetries @xcite .",
    "important insight into this issue has been achieved recently in the context of exactly - solvable models that include these different pairing modes .",
    "analysis of the so(8 ) model @xcite , in which isoscalar and isovector pairing act in either a single active orbital or a series of degenerate orbitals , suggests that isospin restoration or equivalently quartet correlations are extremely important , especially near @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "more recent studies , carried out for models involving non - degenerate orbitals @xcite , reinforce earlier conclusions as to where isoscalar pairing correlations should be most important @xcite,@xcite . furthermore , they make possible the description of deformation , as is critical for systems with @xmath10 , by treating the non - degenerate orbitals as nilsson - like . however , it is still not possible to restore certain symmetries within these models , for example rotational symmetry .    as a consequence ,",
    "there still remain many open issues concerning the role of the different possible modes of pairing in @xmath11 nuclei . in this work ,",
    "we report a systematic study of pairing correlations in the context of the nuclear shell model , whereby deformation can be readily included and symmetries maintained throughout . in this way , we are able to address many of the open issues on the role of the various pairing modes in the presence of nuclear deformation .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe our model and then in section iii describe selected results .",
    "finally , in section iv we summarize the key conclusions of the paper .",
    "to address in a systematic way the role of pairing correlations in the presence of nuclear deformation , we consider neutrons and protons restricted to the orbitals of the @xmath0 shell outside a doubly - magic @xmath12 core and interacting via a schematic hamiltonian    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mass quadrupole operator , @xmath15 creates a correlated @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 pair and @xmath20 creates a correlated @xmath16 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 pair . the first term in the hamiltonian produces rotational collective motion , whereas the second and third term are the isoscalar and isovector pairing interactions , respectively , whose matrix elements can be found in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the last term is the one - body part of the spin - orbit interaction , which splits the @xmath24 levels with a given @xmath25 .",
    "we carry out shell - model calculations systematically as a function of the various strength parameters .",
    "we begin with pure su(3 ) rotational motion @xcite associated with the @xmath26 interaction and then gradually ramp up the various su(3)-breaking terms to assess how they affect the rotational properties .",
    "this includes the isocalar and isovector pairing interactions and the spin - orbit term .",
    "we first consider the nucleus @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , and then systematically increase @xmath29 and @xmath30 to study the role of the number of active neutrons and protons , e.g. whether there is an excess of one over the other and whether the nucleus is even - even , odd - mass or odd - odd .",
    "the nuclei we have treated are @xmath27 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath2ti ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , @xmath3ti ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , @xmath3v ( @xmath36 , @xmath33 ) , and @xmath4cr ( @xmath37 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "some of the observables we have studied are ( 1 ) the energies and associated be(2 ) values of the lowest rotational band , ( 2 ) the number of isovector @xmath20 pairs and ( 3 ) the number of isoscalar @xmath15 pairs . in the following",
    ", we present selected results that derive from these calculations .",
    "before turning to our results for specific nuclei , we first ask whether the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has sufficient flexibility to realistically describe the nuclei under investigation . without making an effort towards an absolute fit ,",
    "we note that the choice @xmath38 , and @xmath39 gives an acceptable fit to the spectra of all the nuclei we have considered .",

    "other than its inability to reproduce the low - lying @xmath43 , @xmath19 state , the optimal hamiltonian does an acceptable job in qualitatively describing the features of the low - energy spectrum .",
    "the lack of an acceptable description of the @xmath44 state reflects the fact that our optimal hamiltonian is missing the strong attraction between @xmath45 nucleons in the stretch configuration .",

    "here we see that the effects of isoscalar and isovector pairing are very different . in the presence of realistic single - particle energies , isovector pairing produces a much more rapid loss of rotational collectivity than isoscalar pairing .     calculated energy splittings @xmath47 in @xmath41 in the ground band of @xmath1ti as a function of the strength of the ( a ) isoscalar pairing interaction and of the ( b ) isovector pairing interaction , with the optimal spin - orbit term present .",
    ", width=680 ]    next we consider the relative effect of the spin - orbit interaction on isovector and isoscalar pairing properties in the optimal su(4 ) limit , where both modes of pairing contribute with the same strength .",
    "this is addressed in figure 6 , where we show the average number of @xmath20 and @xmath15 pairs in the ground band as a function of the strength of the spin - orbit force .",

    "while the number of isovector pairs does not change substantially with increasing spin - orbit strength , the isoscalar pair number is reduced dramatically , especially for the lower angular momentum states of the band .",

    "we see that the spectrum is still highly rotational , despite the fact that the resulting single - particle energies are no longer su(3)-like . to obtain the physical spectrum with a non - rotational character",
    ", it is thus essential to have pairing . it has been traditionally thought that it is the non - su(3 ) order of the single - particle levels that is responsible for the non - rotational character seen in the experimental spectrum @xcite , a conclusion that is not supported by our results .",

    "this point was already suggested in fig .",

    "the @xmath23 states of @xmath3v are of course precisely the same as those already considered in @xmath3ti .",

    "our results are in agreement with that earlier conclusion .",
    "to see these points more clearly , we show in figure 16 the numbers of isovector @xmath20 and isoscalar @xmath15 pairs as a function of angular momentum for the optimal hamiltonian . as in our treatment of @xmath1ti ( see fig .",
