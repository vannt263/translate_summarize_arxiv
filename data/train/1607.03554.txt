    "major mergers , mergers that take place between galaxies of comparable mass ( say stellar or total mass ratios of 1:3  1:5 or larger , with the ratio being the mass of the lower mass galaxy over the mass of the more massive galaxy ) , have attracted attention in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) because they have features that are easily detected even in shallow imaging observations",
    ". however , major mergers may be red herrings when studying the evolution of typical galaxies , many of which may not have undergone a major merger event since @xmath5 = 1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "much more common ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are `` satellite accretion events '' ( stellar or total mass ratio of mostly @xmath6  1:50 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are mergers of a dwarf galaxy with a massive parent galaxy .",
    "evidence for such cannibalism has been found around our own milky way galaxy , including the sagittarius dwarf stream ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the effects of mergers intermediate in strength between major mergers and satellite accretion events , a.k.a .",
    "`` minor mergers '' ( stellar or total mass ratios of roughly between 1:50 and 1:5 ) , have proven to be much harder to observe directly .",
    "such mergers are not expected to transform galaxies as drastically as major mergers ( disk to elliptical transformation ) , but on the other hand one would expect the effects of such mergers to show up as more than just tenuous stellar population changes in the halo ( cf .",
    "local group streams mentioned above ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite have argued that every large galaxy has undergone at least one minor merger during its lifetime .",
    "thus , it can be argued that it is the minor mergers that are the most dynamically significant merging events , in view of their relatively high frequency ( see also @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) and the substantial dynamical and structural impacts on the primary galaxy that such interactions can bring about .",
    "these impacts include the heating and thickening of host galaxy disks , growth of galactic bulges , hierarchical build - up of galaxy mass , counterrotating cores in host galaxies , and triggering and maintenance of bar and spiral structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , @xcite reported a model that reproduced the general structure of the stellar stream around ngc  5907 in a major merger scenario .",
    "@xcite suggested that the colors of the stream may be used to distinguish between a minor satellite accretion event and a major merger origin of the stellar stream in ngc  5907 ( the stream is too faint to be observed spectroscopically ) .",

    "we used 30 positions in a custom offset reuleaux triangle pattern @xcite with a scale of about 75 arcseconds and performed a five - point , small - scale ( 25 arcseconds ) cycling dither pattern around each point in the triangle for each of the three pointings .",
    "the frame time used was 100 seconds ( which gives 93.6 seconds of exposure time per frame at 3.6 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "we consequently spent 14,040 seconds per field on the stream .",
    "previous data from _ spitzer _ program 3 with ten 100 second frames had hinted at the brightest parts of the stellar stream ( see figure  [ overlayfig ] ) .",
    "our new observations are a factor of 15 longer in exposure time .",
    "production of the final mosaiced images made use of several tools .",
    "the processing started with the corrected basic calibrated data ( cbcd ) frames produced by version s18.18.0 of the irac pipeline . the data for each astronomical observing request ( aor ; corresponding to a single dithered field - of - view )",
    "were then self - calibrated using the procedures developed by @xcite to derive delta - corrections to the detector offsets and to fit time - dependent drifts in the sky intensity ( whether due to instrumental effects or changes in the zodiacal light ) .",
    "we then ran the data through a custom column pulldown artifact corrector written by one of us ( m. ashby ) .",
    "the data were again self - calibrated using all three aors together to derive delta - corrections to the offsets ( essentially zero at this point ) and the best fit to time - variable offsets .",
    "these variable offsets optimize the background matching where there is partial overlap between the three fields .",
    "subsequently , to obtain the best astrometric solution , we ran the data through one iteration of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) pipeline @xcite artifact mitigation .",

    "more weight was given to the internal match so that our psfs are very sharp .",
    "the result is that the astrometry in our frames is tied to sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) astrometry .",
    "we then used the goods pipeline mosaicer to mosaic the modified cbcds .",
    "remaining cosmic ray hits were removed using outlier rejection when the cbcd frames were combined into a mosaic .",
    "some differences of the goods pipeline mosaicing compared to the standard ssc pipeline mosaicer include    1 .   less astrometric uncertainty ( because of the very sharp psfs ) in the mosaics coming from the goods pipeline .",
    "we weighted internal matches ( particular sources seen on many cbcd frames ) as indicated above .",
    "this was important when we removed sources by psf fitting below ; 2 .",
    "the drizzle algorithm used to reconstruct an image from undersampled pointings gives superior resolution compared to _",
    "custom software mosaicer and point source extractor ( mopex ) mosaics built with the default mopex mosaicing method .    as stars at the distance of ngc 5907 are completely unresolved in our images , we removed all detected point sources .",
    "we ran the ssc - provided custom software astronomical point source extractor for mopex ( apex ) to find point sources and removed them using the apex quality assurance ( qa ) pipeline .",
    "we opted to remove sources that were centrally concentrated ( aperture flux density ratio within a ten pixel to a three pixel radius was less than 1.3 ) or very faint sources that turned out to be essentially point - like .",
    "once we had removed the point sources via psf fitting , we still had the extended sources left .",
    "we used sextractor @xcite to mask the extended sources .",
    "we extended the masks by two pixels in radius in adobe photoshop to remove a visible halo around the extended sources . because the irac 3.6 @xmath2 m psf is fairly steep within the core ( it drops by a factor of about 500 within a 5-arcsecond radius ) , the outlying parts of the psf are well within the noise in the mosaic image for all but the brightest sources ( see also section  [ psf ] below ) .",
    "typical slightly extended background sources in the irac images have a central pixel value of about 0.05 mjy / sr while the 1-@xmath14 noise in the final mosaic is about 9@xmath1310@xmath15 mjy / sr , and the brightness of these sources at 3.6 @xmath2 m drops below the noise level within about two native pixels or about @xmath16 .",

    "the deep irac image is shown in red.[fig : model1],width=336 ]      +      ngc 5907 was observed using the suprime - cam imager @xcite consisting of ten 2048 @xmath13 4096 pixel charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) with a total field of view of 34  @xmath13  27  covered by 020 pixels , mounted at the prime focus of the 8.2 m subaru telescope , on the morning of 2010 april 12 .",
    "we obtained images through the sdss @xmath1 filters in photometric conditions with 06  09 seeing .",
    "between four and five exposures were obtained per filter to help with cosmic ray rejection and to increase the dynamic range of the final co - added mosaics . additionally , the telescope pointing was dithered slightly between exposures to account for bad pixels / columns and to fill the gaps between individual ccds .",
    "the fully depleted charge - coupled device ( fdccd ) detectors installed on suprime - cam in january 2009 are each divided into four regions read out by separate sets of electronics with different bias levels and gains .",
    "we did not use the standard pipeline reduction for the subaru suprime - cam data because it is important for us to remove all the sources of underlying background emission ( whether instrumental or from the sky ) as carefully as possible .",
    "in our reduction the bias was first subtracted using the overscan area of the images as defined in the headers and the gain was scaled to 1.0 ( everything converted to electrons ) for all regions on all chips .",
    "then , a median bias image was created from a set of bias frames and subtracted to remove residual structure from the edges of the readout regions .",
    "next , a median dome flat was constructed for each band , and divided out of the data frames .",
    "this left images that were largely flat in the central region of the camera , but with significant large scale structure in the sky due to scattered light in the frames , and to a lesser degree in the dome flats @xcite .",
    "to remove the sky background , a median sky image was created from the data frames in each band . to avoid over - subtracting extended structure ,",
    "a two - step masking process was used .",
    "first , object detection was run on each frame and used to make a preliminary mask that , in turn , was used to make a first pass sky image .",
    "this was then scaled to the background of each exposure and subtracted from the images .",
    "this first pass sky - subtracted image was then combined into a mosaic , and a manual mask was made of all extended emission regions visible in the mosaic , ensuring that we are not accidentally removing parts of the stream .",
    "the manual mask was then propagated back to the individual images , and a second pass sky frame made .",
    "this second pass sky frame was then inspected , noisy regions masked , and fitted with a tessellated surface .",
    "the tessellated surface was then scaled to the background in each exposure and subtracted .",
    "finally , to remove scattered light that varies from exposure to exposure , each sky - subtracted exposure was masked with both the detected object mask and the extended source mask , divided into a 8@xmath1316 grid , and fitted by a third - order two - dimensional polynomial over that grid , which was then subtracted .",
    "after attempting fits with higher and lower order polynomials , we settled on the third order polynomial .",
    "that fit to the grid successfully removed the scattered light ( that varies only on large scales , @xmath3  7@xmath20@xmath1314@xmath20 ) in the center of the frames , but did not subtract the extended emission .",
    "after this process some residual scattered light was visible around the edge of the frame where the scattered light had more structure @xcite .",
    "we used the following color - corrected magnitude zero points to convert the counts into magnitudes : @xmath21 = 35.95 , @xmath22 = 36.32 , and @xmath23 = 36.19 for individual frame exposure times of 203 , 119 , and 142 seconds in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these zero - points are good to 0.002 mag random error for @xmath24 and @xmath25 and to 0.003 mag random error for @xmath26 relative to sdss , using the color conversions in @xcite that are valid for colors @xmath27  @xmath28  @xmath24@xmath29@xmath25  @xmath28  1 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath27  @xmath28  @xmath25@xmath29@xmath26  @xmath28  1 for @xmath26 .",
    "the zero point calibration was done against sdss data release 8 with sextractor source extractor auto magnitudes , using 453 , 455 , and 525 stars in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we masked out extended objects by hand in the stream in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 images .",
    "we then cross - convolved the subaru images with the irac psf and the irac 3.6 @xmath2 m image with the subaru psfs .",
    "the suprime - cam @xmath1 psfs were generated by ssc s pfr_estimate.nl perl script .",
    "we subsequently applied a kernel to taper the psfs to avoid ringing in the cross - convolved images .",
    "color index images were then made by combining the mosaiced images from the various observed bands .",
    "we analyzed the color index images by constructing apertures , shown in figure  [ boxfig ] , of the stream , and measured the median color of the color index images ( figure  [ colorindexfig ] ) .",
    "the resulting color plots ( figure  [ magcolorfig ] ) show the median colors vs. the number of the aperture as shown in figure  [ boxfig ] . mean colors and several other properties of the stream are also shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we tested the robustness of the colors by making subaru suprime - cam images that used the first pass sky - subtracted image ( see section  [ subarured ] ) in the background subtraction ( colors changed by less than 0.05 mag ) and by increasing the masked areas within the stream by 510 pixels on each side ( colors changed by less than 0.1 mag ) .",
    "finally , by measuring the variance in `` empty '' sky regions outside the stream we estimated the uncertainty in the sky background value subtraction in the irac image to be about 0.08 mag .",
    "therefore , we conservatively believe that our measured colors are accurate to 0.2 mag .",
    "extinction corrections due to the milky way are expected to be less than 0.02 mag in the visual colors and even less for the visual ",
    "infrared colors , and therefore have not been applied , as their effect is much smaller than the other uncertainties in the colors .    in general the surface brightness is highest in apertures 5  10 and decreases in both directions outside those apertures .",
    "specifically , the surface brightnesses peak at about 27.4 , 26.7 , 26.1 , and 26.7 ab mag  arcsec@xmath30 in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and 3.6 @xmath2 m , respectively , and are at their faintest towards the northern end of the detected area at 28.5 , 28.0 , 27.8 , and 27.6 ab mag  arcsec@xmath30 in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and 3.6 @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "the brightest parts of the stream have a transformed @xmath12 color of about 0.7 using the transformation equations of @xcite ( @xmath12 @xmath31 @xmath32 + 0.2 ) , which is in the range of earlier estimates of @xmath12 = 0.5 @xcite to 0.9 @xcite in the brightest part of the stream ( although note that they measured a different location beyond the sharp turn towards northwest in the stream ) . in general , there is perhaps a slight gradient in the visual colors towards blue as the aperture number increases , as seen in figure  [ magcolorfig ] .",
    "for example , in @xmath33 the average of the median colors in aperture 1  15 is 1.3 and the average in apertures 1623 is 0.9 . while this gradient is within the uncertainties of our colors , it could be consistent with different progenitor star populations that have been stripped at various times as shown in the models of @xcite .",
    "see also fig .",
    "[ visfig ] in the current paper where the right side shows with various colors stars that were stripped from the simulated companion at various times . in the irac colors",
    "this trend is reversed and the colors become slightly redder towards larger aperture numbers along the stream . however , the largest gradients are seen in colors that include the subaru @xmath26-band that has the lowest surface brightness of any of the observed bands in the stream , especially in apertures beyond aperture 23 that are therefore not plotted in fig  [ magcolorfig ] .",
    "see section  [ psf ] below for a discussion about a possible contribution to the color gradients from the extended psfs .",
    "in general , the colors are roughly constant along the stream .",
    "formally , the very extended wings of the psf could spread a small fraction of the light from ngc 5907 into a very faint and large - scale background gradient , dropping away from the galaxy .",
    "such a gradient , if present , could potentially affect the brightness and colors derived for low surface brightness features such as the stellar stream studied here . to evaluate the effect of the extended psf on our measurements , we have derived and adopted extended psfs to construct models of the expected background gradients .    to derive the radial profile of the extended halo light of the irac psf",
    ", we started by constructing the azimuthally averaged profile of http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/spitzer/docs/irac/calibrationfiles/psfprf/[the warm irac extended psf ] .",
    "it provides a radial profile extending to @xmath34 .",
    "the profile at radii from @xmath35 to @xmath36 was determined from serendipitous observations near @xmath37 cet ( mira , program i d 181 ) , and observations around @xmath38 gru ( program i d 1153 ) that were specifically designed to elucidate the extended irac psf .",
    "this very extended profile was normalized to match the radial profile of the above - mentioned extended psf at four points between 63   and 160 .",
    "the agreement in the region of overlap is excellent ( standard deviation less than @xmath39 ) , although the normalization factor required means that the faint ring in the profile at @xmath40 is about 1.7 times brighter than stated in the http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/spitzer/docs/irac/iracinstrumenthandbook/[irac instrument handbook ] ( see section 7.3.4 ) . by combining the two extended psfs ,",
    "the dynamic range of the irac 3.6 @xmath2 m psf was improved from about 2  @xmath13  10@xmath41 to about 10@xmath42 .",
    "the full irac psf to @xmath36 is shown in figure [ fig : psf ] .",
    "an analysis of the bright stars in our subaru images only yielded psf profiles out to @xmath43 , and did not show good consistency between cores ( @xmath44 ) , measured from unsaturated sources , and wings ( @xmath45 ) , measured from much brighter , saturated sources .",
    "a similar analysis of the bright stars in the cosmos field @xcite yielded a better consistency , but was still limited to radial extents of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , for the subaru data , we adopted extended psf profiles , generated from observations made with other telescopes , from the review by @xcite and references therein .",
    "we tested two profiles , to check the sensitivity to the adopted profile .",
    "the first tested profile was psf@xmath47 @xcite , augmented with psf@xmath48 @xcite at radii @xmath49 .",
    "we also tested psf@xmath50 @xcite as an alternate psf .",
    "the narrower core of this psf has a fwhm = @xmath51 , which is a closer match to our measured subaru psfs at fwhm @xmath31 @xmath52 .",
    "more importantly for our models , the surface brightness of this extended psf is @xmath53 times brighter at 200   ",
    "1000   than psf@xmath54 .",
    "these psfs are also shown in figure [ fig : psf ] .    to model the background caused by the extended psf in the irac mosaic",
    ", we worked with a shallower irac mosaic ( from _ spitzer _ program 3 ; see fig .",
    "[ overlayfig ] ) that covered both the stream and the galaxy .",

    "45   of the six brightest stars in the field .",
    "the stars were included to check if the extended psf from the bright stars might have a significant effect .",
    "we then convolved the masked mosaic with a 2-d symmetric kernel generated from the very extended psf profile in figure  [ fig : psf ] .",
    "the kernel is normalized such that the total power is conserved in the convolved image .",
    "this generates the model that is shown in grayscale and contours in figure  [ fig : model1 ] . the diffuse emission in the regions where the masked image is non - zero represents the modeled extended psf halo light from the galaxy and from the six brightest stars in the field . in fact",
    ", the light from the extended psf halo of the brightest stars is found to have little effect on the overall extended psf light predicted in the area of the stream ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model1 ] ) . for each subaru band ,",
    "two similar models were generated using the profiles in figure  [ fig : psf ] , and with the same mask as applied for the irac model .",
    "the resulting subaru model images are very similar to the irac model , except that the light from the extended psfs of the stars is less prominent ( i.e. , underestimated ) because the stars are saturated in the subaru data .",
    "the galaxy itself is only saturated in the central 4   @xmath13 10   region of the @xmath26-band image , which was filled by extrapolation from the @xmath25-band image before calculating the light in the extended psf .",
    "slices through all the models are shown in figure  [ fig : slice ] .",
    "the models indicate that the expected levels of extended psf halo light are about a factor of ten ( or more ) below the background noise level of the images .",

    "we calculated the median surface brightnesses in the apertures defined in section  [ magcolor ] . because the stream is getting very faint in at least the @xmath26-band after its easternmost point ( and towards the northwest from there ) , we calculated the average of the median aperture flux densities in each band , taking into account only apertures 123 .",

    "the main objection to the major galaxy merger model is that ngc 5907 appears to have a thin disk with no obvious bulge ( cf .",

    "our results suggest that the stream in ngc 5907 is relatively metal - rich : the best fitting fsps model has a metallicity log  [ z / z@xmath59 ( @xmath31  [ fe / h ] , assuming the fractional percentage of hydrogen is the same as in the sun and that the iron abundance and the total metal abundances are roughly the same ) = @xmath4 .",

    "* reproduced in fig .",

    "similarly , equation ( 9 ) in @xcite predicts @xmath97 for the disrupted companion of ngc 5907 , using our derived [ fe / h ] value of @xmath4 . this would make this system qualify as a major merger , because the dynamical disk mass in ngc 5907 has been estimated to be about 1.4  @xmath13  10@xmath98  m@xmath76 ( *",

    "the estimated stream mass is only a lower limit to the progenitor mass and thus it can not accurately constrain the merger scenario , because in a minor merger most of the merged companion mass has presumably become part of the bulge and disk of the primary galaxy , ngc  5907 .",
    "we have studied the brightest part of the stellar stream around ngc  5907 with both visible - light ( @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and @xmath25 ) and irac near - infrared 3.6 @xmath2 m images . while the stream is very faint ,",
    "we have managed to generate color index profiles and an sed for the brightest part of the stream .",
    "our results show a slight color change in some of the bands along the stream , most notably in @xmath33 and @xmath32 in which the color becomes bluer after the turning point in the northeast corner of the brightest parts of the stream",
    ". however , there may be a remaining background subtraction problem in the @xmath26-band and our results are essentially consistent with no color gradients along the stream .",
    "we have fitted fsps stellar population synthesis models with a single - age stellar population .",
    "the best fit is achieved for an old and relatively metal - rich stellar population in the stream .",
    "such a stellar population appears to be more consistent with a rather massive minor merger event than with the stripped stars from a dwarf galaxy accretion event .",
    "future work should include better visible light photometry of the stream , and improving the stellar population synthesis model predictions in the near - infrared .",
