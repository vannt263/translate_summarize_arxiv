    "colloidal gels are the focus of an intensive research effort for both fundamental and practical reasons . on the one hand , they are model systems to understand the interplay between percolation , phase separation and dynamical arrest in systems with attractive interactions  @xcite . on the other hand , colloidal gels are ubiquitous , e.g. , in the food , drug , personal care and cosmetic industries , where they are often used as a means to stabilize a complex formulation against macroscopic phase separation .",
    "mechanically , colloidal gels are viscoelastic systems with a predominantly solid - like behavior .",
    "however , they typically yield under a modest stress , often including the gravitational stress exerted by their own weight .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that many studies have been devoted to the sedimentation behavior of colloidal gels , revealing a wealth of fascinating but yet not fully understood phenomena , such as delayed sedimentation  @xcite , creep  @xcite , and fracture associated with complex flow patterns  @xcite . with a few notable exceptions  @xcite",
    ", most previous work has focussed on the macroscopic behavior of the gels , typically by measuring the time evolution of the gel height , @xmath3 .",
    "this has prevented a thorough test of the various models proposed to rationalize the gel behavior , and in particular of the poroelastic model  @xcite .    to overcome these limitations ,",
    "we have recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite a full characterization of the temporal evolution of the concentration profile , @xmath4 , sedimentation velocity profile , @xmath5 and microscopic rearrangement dynamics of a colloidal gel . in particular",
    ", we have shown that the poroelastic model captures remarkably well the evolution of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . additionally , a single quantity , the compressive strain rate @xmath6 , was shown to control both the macroscopic behavior and the microscopic dynamics . here , we test the generality of the findings of ref .  @xcite by studying gels with different particle concentration and interparticle attraction strength .",
    "we focus on the sedimentation kinetics and on the asymptotic concentration profiles as the gels attain mechanical equilibrium , showing that the concentration profiles have a universal shape . using the poroelastic model  @xcite , we show that this remarkable scaling behavior stems from a particularly simple relation between elastic stress and local volume fraction .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : m&m ] we describe the system and the optical methods used to investigate it .",
    "the main features of the poroelastic model are recalled in sec .  [",

    "the colloidal particles are spheres of a polytetrafluoroethylene copolymer ( mfa ) .",
    "they have a crystalline core , leading to peculiar optical properties that allow one to measure accurately the local volume fraction , as discussed below .",
    "the data presented here are obtained using two different batches , b1 and b2 , for which the particle radii are slightly different : @xmath7 nm and @xmath8 nm , for batches b1 and b2 respectively . the high density @xmath9 of mfa , combined with its lack of swelling , allows for a precise determination of the initial particle volume fraction @xmath10 by density measurements .",
    "the particles are suspended in an aqueous solution of 0.1 m nacl , to screen electrostatic repulsive interactions , and different amounts of urea were added to suppress coherent polarized scattering by matching the solvent and particle refractive indices . a nonionic surfactant , triton x100 ,",
    "is added to induce attractive depletion interactions  @xcite , whose range @xmath11 nm is of the order of the size of the micelles formed by the surfactant . in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the concentration of surfactant , defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the volume of the surfactant , that of the particles , and the total volume of the suspension , respectively .",
    "a detailed description of the phase behavior of this system can be found in  @xcite . in brief , the system displays a metastable liquid - liquid coexistence gap ; when the amount of added depletant is sufficiently large to drive the colloidal suspension within the coexistence region , as in our case , arrested spinodal decomposition leads to the formation of a disordered gel .",
    "all samples described here are deeply in the coexistence region , far from the spinodal line . because the range of the attractive potential is much smaller than the particle size , our system is well described by baxter s adhesive hard sphere model  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to quantify the strength of the attractive interactions via baxter s stickiness parameter @xmath17 . using methods detailed in  @xcite",
    ", we estimate @xmath18 for the gels of batch b1 and @xmath19 for the gels of batch b2 at @xmath20 .",
    "the samples are prepared by mixing a particle suspension and a surfactant solution with appropriate concentrations ; the resulting suspension is loaded in cells with square cross section ( either @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) and filled to an initial height @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) for batch b1 ( b2 ) .",
    "the samples are shaken at time @xmath25 and then left undisturbed for measurements during the sedimentation process .",
    "the apparatus used for light scattering measurements on systems prepared from the first batch is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] ( a ) .",
    "the sample s is immersed in a transparent water bath b to minimize temperature gradients and temperature fluctuations .",
    "it is illuminated by a laser sheet ls , of thickness @xmath26 , height sufficient to cover the whole gel column , and in - vacuo wavelength @xmath27 .",
    "the two lenses l1 and l2 form a demagnified image of the sample onto a charge - coupled detector ( ccd ) camera . their focal length is 200 mm and 58 mm , respectively .",
    "two crossed polarizers , p1 and p2 , are used to illuminate the sample with light polarized in the vertical direction while detecting only depolarized scattered light , i.e. light linearly polarized in the horizontal direction .",
    "note that this apparatus combines features of both imaging and scattering  @xcite , since an image of the sample is formed , but using only light scattered around a well - defined scattering wave vector @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the refractive index of the solvent and @xmath30 deg the scattering angle . a typical image recorded by the ccd",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] ( b ) .",
    "the gel appears as a speckled , bright column , while the supernatant is black since scattering by the solvent is negligible .",
    "each speckle results from the interference of the light scattered by a small volume in the sample , of depth equal to the laser sheet thickness and lateral size @xmath31 .",
    "the speckle size is controlled to about 2 ccd pixels by adjusting the range of @xmath32 accepted by the detection optics , using the diaphragm d placed in the common focal plane of l1 and l2 .    by analyzing a time series of ccd images , we measure four different quantities . the gel total height @xmath3 is simply obtained from the height of the bright column .",
    "the concentration profiles @xmath4 are obtained by averaging the intensity @xmath33 over regions of interest ( rois ) of height @xmath34 and width equal to the cell width .",
    "we emphasize that in general the ( polarized ) scattered intensity is proportional to both @xmath1 and the particle structure factor @xmath35 , thus making impossible a determination of the volume fraction based on @xmath33 without a detailed knowledge of the sample structure .",
    "by contrast , our particles posses a crystalline core and thus partially depolarize the scattered light . as discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the depolarized scattered light can be shown to be simply proportional to @xmath1 , regardless of the structure .",
    "we use an image taken immediately after homogenizing the sample to determine the proportionality constant between @xmath33 and @xmath1 and to correct for any non - uniformity in the incident beam intensity profile . as the gel sediments ,",
    "the speckle pattern is shifted downwards : using cross - correlation methods similar to those used in particle imaging velocimetry  @xcite , we are able to measure the full sedimentation velocity profiles , @xmath5 , with a vertical resolution of about 0.5 mm . finally , we measure the microscopic dynamics as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , probing in particular particle motion in the horizontal plane , on a length scale of the order of @xmath36 . as a final remark",
    ", we emphasize that our measurements of @xmath1 , of the microscopic dynamics and , to some extent , of @xmath37 all rely on the assumption that the ccd images are formed only by singly scattered photons .",
    "fortunately , the relative low average refractive index of the mfa particles ( @xmath38 ) allow one to carefully match @xmath39 using water - based solvents , thereby effectively suppressing multiple scattering .    for systems prepared from the second batch , we use a simplified version of the apparatus shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] , optimized for measuring only @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it consists of a custom - made light scattering setup , operating at a fixed scattering angle @xmath40 .",
    "selection of the incident and detected polarization of the scattered intensity is made by means of two glan - thomson polarizers with an extinction ratio better than @xmath41 .",
    "the cell is mounted on a dc- motorized micrometric translator allowing cell positioning with a resolution of @xmath42 and an absolute accuracy of about @xmath43 .",
    "a he - ne laser beam is mildly focused in the cell to a spot size @xmath44 , corresponding to a depth of focus ( rayleigh range ) of about 10 mm , fixing the maximum useful optical path in the cell .",
    "the whole setup is enclosed into a removable hood allowing to control temperature to better than @xmath45 .",
    "valuable information on the distribution of the gravity - induced stress in the sample can be obtained by polarimetry .",
    "the sample is illuminated by a collimated beam of white light , issued from a led source .",
    "a demagnified image of the gel is formed onto a cmos camera , working in transmission .",
    "two crossed polarizers are placed before and after the sample . under these conditions , for a stress - free sample essentially no light is detected by the camera , because the birefringence induced by the particles is extremely weak . because stress induces birefringence in the particles  @xcite , regions of the gel where gravity - induced stress accumulates depolarize the incident light and appear as bright in the image ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : polarimetry ] below for an example ) .",
    "more precisely  @xcite , when the transmission axes of the polarizers are oriented at @xmath46 deg with respect to the vertical direction , stresses along the horizontal and vertical direction are visualized .",
    "conversely , by turning the polarizers so that their axes are vertical and horizontal , stresses oriented at @xmath46 deg with respect to the vertical direction can be imaged .",
    "we shortly recall here the main features of the poroelastic model , a popular model introduced by biot  @xcite and widely used in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to describe the deformation of a gel under its own weight .",
    "the system is treated as a continuum medium that responds elastically to a compressive deformation .",
    "the effect of the solvent back flow through the gel is accounted for by introducing a viscous friction term . for the sake of completeness , we introduce also a solid friction term , due to the adhesion of the gel to the container walls , which is usually not discussed in the literature .    typically , the gel sedimentation occurs at a very low reynolds number and the rate of change of @xmath37 is small ; thus , inertia terms can be neglected . using the reference frame shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] with @xmath47 the cell bottom , newton s law for a gel slice of thickness @xmath48 yields @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is pressure , @xmath51 the buoyant density , @xmath52 the acceleration of gravity , @xmath53 the elastic stress , and @xmath54 a characteristic length . the term on the l.h.s",
    ". originates from the viscous drag , while the terms on the r.h.s . account for the buoyant weight , the elastic stress and the wall friction , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath54 represents jansen s screening length  @xcite , such that the gravitational stress in a given horizontal plane @xmath55 exerted by a gel slice located @xmath56 above @xmath55 is divided by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "this screening is due to the redirection of part of the gel weight towards the walls . for @xmath54 to be finite , the gel must `` push '' against the walls as it is compressed ; in other words , the gel must have a positive poisson s ratio @xmath58 , such that @xmath59 is finite  @xcite , where @xmath60 is side of the square cell section and @xmath61 is coulomb s solid friction coefficient .",

    "@xmath37 vanishes and so does the viscous friction .",

    "in this section , we focus on the particle volume fraction and interaction strength dependence of the concentration profiles in the long time limit , when no sedimentation is experimentally detectable and the gel is very close to mechanical equilibrium .    for gels of batch b1 and b2 , concentration profiles where measured at least 240 and 500 hours after initializing the sample , respectively .",

    "these debris must have similar structure regardless of @xmath10 , so that the network resulting from their accumulation at the bottom of the cell has essentially the same mechanical properties .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the concentration profiles are not very smooth",

    "@xcite exhibit a smoother behavior , probably because in the beam deflection method the concentration profile is smoothed over a length comparable to the cell optical path ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the noise in @xmath1 as measured here may be due also to an extra - contribution to the intensity of the depolarized scattered light stemming from stress - induced birefringence , which we will show below to be spatially non - uniform . in spite of these differences ,",
    "we emphasize that there is an overall good agreement between @xmath1 measured by the beam deflection and the depolarized scattered intensity methods  @xcite .",

    "the intensity profiles along an horizontal line , corrected for the exposure time , clearly show that the vertical component of the stress dominates over that at @xmath46 deg , implying that wall friction can be neglected for our gels . interestingly , this is at variance with observations for other kinds of colloidal gels  @xcite and may be due to the fact that here the percolating network initially formed is then broken , in contrast to the gels of ref .",

    "this is probably due to the fact that the structure of the gel is similar , as discussed in relation to the scaling of the concentration profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] a ) .",
    "by contrast , the temporal evolution of the strain rate is significantly different , @xmath138 decaying faster for the gels at lower initial @xmath1 .",
    "this is at odd with the scaling behavior of the concentration profiles reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles]a , where it was shown that the top part of the gels at fixed @xmath96 have the same concentration profile .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood be recalling that , although the top of the profiles for samples prepared at different @xmath10 are similar ( see fig.[sec : equilibriumprofiles ] ) , gels prepared at higher initial concentration reach a higher volume fraction at the cell bottom .",
    "therefore , they display in this region a lower permeability and a higher stiffness , which slows down the compaction process .",
    "we have studied the sedimentation kinetics and the concentration profiles of depletion - induced colloidal gels , varying both the particle volume fraction and the strength of the interparticle interactions . by using optical methods that combine light scattering and imaging , we have been able to gain detailed information on the evolution of the concentration profiles and the dynamics of the gels .",
    "coupled to stress visualization experiments that rule out any significant role of solid friction on the cell walls , this has allowed us to measure quantitatively the volume fraction dependence of the elastic response of the gels and to test thoroughly the poroelastic model . in discussing the @xmath10 and @xmath96 dependence of the parameters issued from the poroelastic model",
    ", it is essential to keep in mind that the model can only be applied to the last regime of the sedimentation process , i.e. the compaction of a denser gel formed by the falling debris of the initial network that fails under gravity .",
    "this allows one to rationalize some apparently paradoxical results , such as the scaling of the asymptotic concentration profiles obtained at fixed @xmath96 and variable @xmath10 .    our work and",
    "that of other groups using confocal microscopy  @xcite show that detailed microscopic information on the structure and the dynamics of the gels can be very valuable in order to better understand the behavior of colloidal gels under gravitational stress .",
    "more work along these lines will be required to fully understand the microscopic origin of the diversity of behaviors observed for different systems .",
