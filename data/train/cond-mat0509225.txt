    "to understand the properties of materials one has to understand surfaces and interfaces : materials interact with their environment through their surfaces , and material properties are profoundly influenced by internal interfaces .",
    "processes related to surfaces and interfaces therefore play a critical role in nature and in a variety of technological applications , such as electronic , magnetic , and optical devices , sensors , catalysts , coatings , and many other industrial systems and processes .",
    "@xcite surfaces also play a vital role in biology and medicine , since most biological reactions occur at surfaces and interfaces .",
    "the applications of surface science in medicine range from the growth of bio - compatible surfaces for tissue cultures , through medical implants , to the design of innumerable medical devices.@xcite it is therefore crucial to understand the fundamental processes occurring at surfaces and interfaces in order to provide means of controlling and manipulating such systems .",
    "the large - scale properties of growing interfaces have been the object of an enormous amount of work in recent years,@xcite but much less attention has been paid to interfacial structure on a microscopic scale .",
    "this is unfortunate because many important interface properties , such as mobility and catalytic and chemical activity , are largely determined by the microscopic interface structure .",
    "the microscopic structure limits the interfacial propagation velocity under an external driving force , such as an external field for a magnetic or dielectric domain wall , or a difference in chemical potential between the bulk phases for a crystal surface .",
    "since the detailed microscopic mechanism of the interface motion is often not known , one standard way to gain insight in the process is by constructing a stochastic model that mimics its essential features .",
    "dynamics that conserve the order parameter , or ones that do not , must be chosen according to the physical characteristics of the system .",
    "once this is decided , there are several dynamics in each category to choose among .",
    "it is well established that structures arising from different dynamics that obey detailed balance and respect the same conservation laws exhibit universal asymptotic large - scale features .",
    "however , recent studies@xcite show that there are important differences between the _ microstructures _ of field - driven interfaces obtained with different dynamics , and that these differences very significantly influence important interface properties such as mobility . a mean - field , nonlinear - response theory developed in refs .",
    "indicates that there are two different classes of nonconservative dynamics that lead to significantly different surface microstructures .",
    "these are the _ soft _ dynamics in which the single - site transition rates can be factorized into one part that depends only on the applied force and a second part that depends only on the interaction energies , and the _ hard _ dynamics for which this factorization is not possible.@xcite by this classification , the widely used glauber and metropolis dynamics are hard .",
    "soft dynamics are appropriate for solidification or adsorption problems where the driving force is a chemical - potential difference.@xcite    in previous papers@xcite two of us introduced a dynamic mean - field approximation for the microstructure , based on the burton - cabrera - frank solid - on - solid ( sos ) approximation.@xcite for soft dynamics , interface structures should remain independent of the applied force , while there should be a clear dependence on the force for hard dynamics .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulation results with the soft glauber@xcite and the standard hard glauber dynamics@xcite confirm these predictions .",
    "moreover , sos surfaces generated with the hard glauber dynamics exhibit a skewness that is absent for the soft glauber dynamics .",
    "since the mean - field results depend on the absence of short - range correlations along the interfaces , it remains an open question to which extent these characteristics are shared by all soft and hard dynamics .    for the present study we have considered two dynamics that include a local energy barrier representing a transition state inserted between individual ising or lattice - gas states .",
    "such arrhenius dynamics , as they are often called , are appropriate in kinetic mc simulations of discrete ising or lattice - gas models in which the discrete states serve as approximations for high - probability configurations in an underlying continuous potential.@xcite examples are the study of diffusion in a lattice - gas model in a continuous corrugation potential,@xcite the relaxation process from the high - spin state of molecular bistable solids,@xcite or the approximation of a continuous spin model with strong uniaxial anisotropy by an ising model.@xcite when applied to kinetic ising lattice - gas models , arrhenius dynamics give nucleation rates quite different from the ones given by the standard glauber dynamics;@xcite another warning about the importance of choosing the right dynamics for specific physical or chemical systems .",
    "the two arrhenius dynamics that we consider here are the common one - step - dynamics ( osd)@xcite and the two - step transition dynamic approximation ( tda).@xcite the osd dynamics are soft and the tda dynamics are hard , according to the definitions given above .",
    "their transition rates are defined in sec .",
    "the osd dynamics are commonly used in studies of adsorption , such as the electrosorption of halides on single - crystal silver electrodes.@xcite among the experimental systems that have been described with the tda dynamics are the diffusion of h atoms on single - crystal tungsten surfaces.@xcite    sos surfaces belong to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) dynamic universality class,@xcite in which the macroscopic , stationary distribution for flat , moving interfaces is gaussian , corresponding to a random walk with independent increments .",
    "nevertheless , the step heights in several discrete models in this class are correlated at _ short _ distances.@xcite in the mean - field approximation used here , these short - range correlations are ignored .",
    "the resulting discrepancies will be apparent when we compare the theoretical results with kinetic mc simulations .",

    "this phenomenon is commonly observed in driven interfaces .",
    "it occurs even when the _ long - range _ correlations vanish as they do for interfaces in the kpz dynamic universality class , to which the present models belong for all finite , nonzero values of @xmath9 .",
    "skewness has also been observed in several other sos - type models , such as the body - centered sos model studied by neergaard and den  nijs,@xcite the model for step propagation on crystal surfaces with a kink - ehrlich - schwoebel barrier studied by pierre - louis et al.,@xcite and a model for the local time horizon in parallel kinetic mc simulations studied by korniss et al.@xcite no skewness was observed for the sos model with the soft glauber dynamics.@xcite however , a small skewness was observed for the ising model ( whose interfaces include bubbles and overhangs ) with soft glauber dynamics ( about two orders of magnitude smaller than the skewness observed for the hard glauber dynamics).@xcite the correlations associated with the skewness generally lead to a broadening of protrusions on the leading edge ( `` hilltops '' ) , while those on the trailing edge ( `` valley bottoms '' ) are sharpened,@xcite or the other way around.@xcite in terms of spin - class populations , the former corresponds to @xmath128 and @xmath129 . the relative skewness can therefore be quantified by the two functions,@xcite @xmath130 and@xcite @xmath131 these two skewness parameters are shown together in fig .  [ fig : skew](a ) for the tda , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : skew](b ) for the osd . for both dynamics",
    "the relative skewness is seen to be considerably stronger at the lower temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence is especially pronounced for @xmath132 , due to the low concentration of sites in the class 21 + at low temperatures .",
    "the osd results contrast with previous results that showed that an sos interface with soft glauber dynamics does not present skewness.@xcite in the present case , the sos interface evolving under the soft osd dynamics presents stronger relative skewness at lower temperature than the one evolving under the hard tda dynamics .",
    "another way to visualize the skewness is to consider the joint two - step pdf , @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "logarithmic contour plots of this quantity for both dynamics at different values of @xmath9 , for @xmath134 at @xmath114 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_tda ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_1sd ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that in both dynamics the contours change with @xmath9 . for @xmath9=0",
    "a symmetric diamond shape with equidistant contours indicates statistical independence with single - step pdfs given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : step_pdf ] ) .",
    "this equilibrium result is correctly observed in both the tda dynamics , fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_tda](a ) , and the osd dynamics , fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_1sd](a ) .",
    "however , for nonzero fields the dynamics show different behavior . for the tda , at stronger fields , the shapes are convex in the second quadrant [ @xmath135 fig .",

    "this shape indicates that large negative @xmath68 tend to be followed by large positive @xmath136 ( sharp valleys ) . for weak fields ,",

    "this shape indicates that large negative @xmath68 tend to be followed by smaller positive @xmath136 ( rounded valleys ) . for both dynamics the field dependence in the fourth quadrant , corresponding to the shape of ``  hilltops",
    ", '' is much weaker that in the second quadrant .",
    "as expected , the contour plots for interfaces with @xmath134 are always symmetric about the line @xmath137 for both dynamics .",
    "in this work we have continued our studies of the microstructure of an unrestricted sos interface driven far from equilibrium by an applied field .",
    "previous studies indicate that different dynamics can lead to important differences in the microstructure of the moving interface and that extreme care therefore must be taken in selecting stochastic dynamics appropriate for the specific physical system of interest.@xcite    for this study we have considered two dynamics that include a local energy barrier representing a transition state inserted between the individual ising or lattice - gas states .",
    "such arrhenius dynamics , as they are often called , are appropriate in kinetic mc simulations of discrete ising or lattice - gas models in which the discrete states serve as approximations for high - probability configurations in an underlying continuous potential .",
    "the two arrhenius dynamics that we considered are the commonly used one - step - dynamics ( osd)@xcite and the two - step transition dynamics approximation ( tda).@xcite the osd belongs to the class of dynamics known as soft and the tda to the class known as hard.@xcite    we studied the microstructure and velocity of the sos interface by kinetic mc simulations and by a non - linear mean - field theory developed in previous papers.@xcite we calculated the interface velocity as a function of the driving field , temperature , and angle of the interface relative to the lattice axes .",
    "we also studied the local shape of the interface in terms of the spin - class populations , the average height of a step , and the probability density for individual steps in the interface .",
    "the theory predicts significant differences between interfaces moving under hard and soft dynamics . for soft dynamics",
    ", interface structures should remain independent of the applied field , while there must be a clear dependence on the field for hard dynamics .",
    "for the tda dynamics we found generally very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the mc simulations .",
    "however , for the osd dynamics we found that , contrary to the theoretical prediction , there is a weak but clear dependence of the interface structure on the field .",
    "this dependence is manifest in the average stationary step height and in the mean stationary class populations , which both show a weak dependence with the field that saturates for strong fields . as a consequence of this dependence",
    ", the theoretical results for the velocities do not match very closely the simulated results for low temperatures , particularly for strong fields and small angles .    the interfaces moving under the hard tda dynamics present similar characteristics to those evolving under a hard glauber dynamics .",
    "however , we found significant differences between the structure of surfaces evolving under the soft osd dynamics and the soft glauber dynamics studied in ref .  .",
    "the velocities under the osd dynamics present a discontinuity at @xmath116 that is not observed for the soft glauber dynamics .",
    "more interesting is the existence of strong skewness in the osd model .",
    "this indicates that lack of skewness is not a necessary characteristic of soft dynamics , as earlier results seemed to suggest.@xcite    within the mean - field approximation used here , individual steps of the interface are assumed to be statistically independent .",
    "short - range correlations are not taken into account by this approximation .",
    "the skewness between the spin population on the leading and trailing edges of the interface is a consequence of such short - range correlations .",
    "for both the tda and the osd dynamics , the interfaces undergo a gradual breakdown of up / down symmetry for increasing fields , which has also been observed in other examples of driven interfaces.@xcite this breakdown is clearly evident for the osd model , and it is probably the reason why the mean - field approximation misses the weak field dependence in the osd interface structure .",
    "it is obviously important to note and eventually to understand the discrepancies between the theoretical mean - field predictions and the simulation results for the osd dynamics .",
    "however , on a qualitative level the theory predicts quite accurately the differences between the structures generated by the two dynamics . the average step height for the tda increases dramatically with increasing field , as accurately predicted by the theory .",
    "for the osd , the step height does increase somewhat with @xmath9 , in contrast to the theoretical prediction of @xmath9-independence , but the increase is very small . in comparison with the tda , the osd surface remains very smooth , with an average step height well below unity .",
    "as in previous studies , our results indicate strong differences between interfaces moving under different dynamics , emphasizing the need for extreme care in selecting the appropriate dynamics for the physical system of interest . even in cases where soft dynamics are the more appropriate choice , as for solidification or adsorption problems where the driving force is a chemical - potential difference,@xcite the results can depend significantly on which soft dynamics are chosen .",
