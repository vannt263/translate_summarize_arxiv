    "after discovery of such an expansion in @xmath1 , understanding its theoretical reasons presents one of the fundamental open questions in physics . identifying the cause of this late time acceleration is a challenging problem in cosmology .",
    "physicists are interested in considering this accelerated expansion in a gravitational background and they proposed some candidates to explain it .",
    "for example , a positive cosmological constant leads to an accelerated expansion , but it is plagued by the fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "in other words , the left hand side of einstein equations can modify by the cosmological constant as a geometrical modification or it can be interpreted as a kinematic term on the right hand side with the equation of state parameter @xmath2 . by considering @xmath3 for a source term , it is possible to further modify this approach . this consideration has interpretation of dark energy which has been investigated in literature armendariz1,armendariz2,armendariz3,armendariz5,armendariz6,armendariz9,armendariz10 . in dark energy models ,",
    "the acceleration expansion of the universe is due to an unknown ingredient added to the cosmic pie .",
    "the effects of this unknown ingredient is extracted by modifying the stress energy tensor of the einstein equation with a matter which is different from than the usual matter and radiation components .",
    "on the other hand , it is proposed that the presence of accelerated expansion of the universe indicate that the standard general relativity requires modification .",
    "to do so , one can generalize the einstein field equations to obtain a modified version of gravity .",
    "there are different branches of modified gravity with various motivations , such as brane world cosmology @xcite , lovelock gravity lovelocka , lovelockb , lovelock2a , lovelock2d , lovelock2f , scalar - tensor theories jordana , jordanb , jordanc , jordand , jordane , jordan22,jordan23,jordan24 , and @xmath4 gravity fr1,fr11,akbar , fr2,fr3,fr4,fr5,fr7,fr8,fr9,fr99,fr10,fr15,fr16,fr166,hendigrg .",

    "the pmi theory is more interesting with regard to maxwell field , and for unit power , it reduces to linear maxwell theory .",

    "first of all , due to the high energy properties of the black holes , it is necessary to consider quantum corrections of classical perspectives .",
    "one of the methods to include quantum corrections of gravitational fields is by considering an energy dependent spacetime .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the quantum correction of gravitational systems could be observed in dependency of spacetime on the energy of particles probing it which is gravity s rainbow point of view uncertain1,smolin1,grattini1 .",
    "since we are modifying our point of view to an energy dependent spacetime , it is expected to find its effects on the properties of black holes , especially in the context of their thermodynamics .",
    "this is another motivation for considering gravity s rainbow generalization . also , there are specific achievements for gravity s rainbow in the context of black holes which among them one can name : modified uncertainty principle @xcite , existence of remnants for the black holes @xcite , furnishing a bridge towards horava  lifshitz gravity @xcite , providing possible solution toward information paradox @xcite and finally being uv completion of einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "in addition , as it was pointed out before , in the context of cosmology , it presents a possible solution toward big bang singularity problem @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath0 gravity provides correction toward gravitational sector of the einstein theory of gravity .",
    "the importance of this correction is highlighted in the context of black holes . in order to have better picture regarding the physical nature of the black holes ,",
    "one may consider high energy regime effects , as well ( considering that the concepts of hawking radiation was derived by studying black holes in semi classical / quantum regime ) . here , we apply @xmath0 gravity s rainbow to find the effects of @xmath9 generalization as well as energy dependency of spacetime on the black hole solutions .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we are going to investigate black hole solutions in einstein - gravity s rainbow with pmi and cim fields .",
    "then , we want to investigate conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the solutions and check the first law of thermodynamics . in section iii",

    "we also discuss thermal stability of these solutions and criteria governing stability / instability in sec .",
    "[ stability ] .",
    "then , we consider pure @xmath0 gravity s rainbow and compare these solutions with @xmath0 gravity s rainbow with cim source and give some related comments regarding to its thermodynamical behavior .",
    "finally , we finish our paper by some conclusions .",
    "here , we are going to introduce @xmath8-dimensional solutions of the einstein - gravity s rainbow in the presence of pmi field with the following lagrangian @xmath10where @xmath5 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the ricci scalar and the cosmological constant . in eq .",

    "it is worthwhile to mention that the asymptotical behavior of these solutions is independent of the rainbow functions and the power of pmi source .",
    "this independency comes from the fact that rainbow functions are sensible in high energy regime such as near horizon and one expects to ignore its effects far from the black hole ( we only consider high energy regime ) .",
    "in addition , at large distances , the electric field of maxwell and pmi theories vanishes , and therefore , one may expect to ignore the effects of electric charge far from the origin . in order to investigate the possibility of the horizon",
