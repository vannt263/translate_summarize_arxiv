    "the basic idea of shell models of turbulence is to describe fluctuations of velocity ( or vorticity , or temperature , etc . ) in an octave of wave numbers @xmath5 by one `` collective '' variable @xmath6 .",
    "this range of wave numbers is called a shell ( the @xmath7th shell ) , and the variable @xmath6 is called a shell variable . in this way one obtains a dynamical system of limited number of degrees of freedom , describing a cascade process of energy ( or enstrophy , or temperature ) in a large interval of wave numbers .",
    "the general form of shell equations can be written for real or complex shell variables as @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for complex conjugation , @xmath10 is the external force and @xmath11 models the action of the viscous force .",
    "the energy in the @xmath7th shell is taken to be proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "recently shell models have attracted new interest .",
    "the gledzer - yamada - ohkitani model@xcite was extensively investigated by several groups@xcite , not only numerically , but also analytically@xcite .",
    "this is a model for 3d - turbulence , written for real@xcite or complex@xcite shell variables , and takes into account only nonlinear interactions between neighbouring shells : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the reynolds number , @xmath15 a typical wave number in the @xmath7th shell , and the choice of three coefficients , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , ensures energy conservation in limit @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "we will only consider the case when @xmath21 .",
    "there are two sharp qualitative differences between shell models generally considered , and the navier - stokes equation : first shell variables can not describe spatial fluctuations within one shell , because they have only one variable per shell ; and , secondly , equations like ( [ yam - okh ] ) only include local interactions in @xmath22-space .",
    "the first shortcoming is the inevitable price to pay for the simplicity and low dimensionality of the system .",
    "one can still obtain interesting models by considering a hierarchical system in which the number of variables in the shell @xmath7 grows exponentially with @xmath7 .",
    "such a model , for 2d - turbulence , was investigated in @xcite .",
    "here however the number of degrees of freedom again grows very large , and one can not consider much larger intervals of wave number , than in full - scale simulations of navier - stokes equation .",
    "the second shortcoming can be remediated already within a shell model . for 2d - turbulence , this was done in an earlier paper by one of authors@xcite .",
    "we shall consider this class of models , only here rewritten for complex shell variables .",
    "the main particularity of 2d navier - stokes equations is the appearence of an infinite number of additional integrals of motion of the inviscid equations .",
    "the most striking one is enstrophy , the integrated squared vorticity . to reproduce the general properties of 2d - turbulence , it is essential to at least conserve energy and enstrophy in the infinite reynolds number limit .    in @xcite shell",
    "model equations of 2d - turbulence were obtained in the form @xmath23 if @xmath24 , only local interactions are kept , and one returns to the form of ( [ yam - okh ] ) .",
    "the analogues of energy and enstrophy are the quadratic forms @xmath25 and @xmath26 . demanding energy and",
    "enstrophy conservation gives two relations between the three elements @xmath27 inside the brackets in ( [ casfr ] ) , and we can rewrite the equations as : @xmath28 the coefficients @xmath29 were computed from a projection of the 2d navier - stokes equations on a hierarchical function basis in @xcite , constructed from basis functions that have support in one octave in wave - number .",
    "the normalisation of shell energy and shell enstrophy then come out as @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of this procedure , and here just list the first values of @xmath29 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; roughly speaking , the interaction strength decreases by a factor about three when distance between levels increases by one .",
    "we are in this paper mainly interested in the qualitative properties of the model , which ( seemingly ) depend only on the conservation of two quadratic integrals , and not on the numerical values of the interaction coefficients .",
    "we have therefore performed numerical experiments , where we keep just one interaction coefficient at a time , setting the other ones to zero , and compared the results to keeping all of them .",
    "we have though also evaluated the kolmogorov  kraichnan constant @xmath37 , under the ( not quite true ) assumption that the spectrum in the inertial range obeys : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean enstrophy dissipation .",
    "we here find order of magnitude agreement with reported values in the literature , partially justifying the procedure used to obtain the coefficients @xmath40 .",
    "we have also for completeness compared the results using real or complex shell variables .",
    "the main difference is that the complex model can fluctuate in phase while keeping a more steady amplitude , while the real model must go through zero amplitude to change sign .",
    "it may therefore be argued that the complex model is qualitatively more similar to true turbulence , than is the real model . in fig.[f : ens_z ] we show the time evolutions of total enstrophy @xmath41 and the rate of enstrophy dissipation @xmath42 in the complex model . in the real model the value of total enstrophy fluctuates more , but",
    "the peaks of enstrophy dissipations rate are less sharp .",
    "when we compute long averages over time , we however find that the real and complex models give the same result , only the complex model needs less time to approach a statistically stationary state .",
    "in our numerical experiments the external force is random in time , with rms - amplitude order unity , and acts on the first and second ( or fourth and fifth ) shells .",
    "energy is transported by the inverse cascade from where the force acts down towards the low @xmath7 shells , where we have to remove it to obtain a stationary regime .",
    "we implemented this condition in the standard way , by adding to the equations a linear friction term , acting in the zeroth shell ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the number of shells was 31 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "all the figures give the data for reynolds number @xmath45 .",
    "to integrate the equations we used a fourth - order runge - kutta integrator with time step 0.1 .",
    "we remark that in 2d  turbulence , and in our shell models , the characteristic times are approximately the same on all spatial scales in the inertial range .",
    "the accuracy of the integration method was checked by repeating the integrations using smaller step - size .",
    "runs up to @xmath46 time - steps were made . unless where indicated , all figures show data sufficiently converged so that the statistical scatter is not visible , and simulations of the model using the full set of interaction coefficients @xmath40 .    in fig.[f :",
    "speclar ] we show the shell energy distribution .",
    "the two straight lines drawn seem to indicate that the spectrum consists of two parts : one from where the force acts up to @xmath7 about 20 , with slope @xmath47 , and one from @xmath7 around 20 to about 26 , with appearent slope @xmath48 . for higher @xmath7",
    "the spectrum is visually curved in a log  log plot ( see fig . [",
    "f : speclar ] ; we are evidently in the dissipative range .",
    "one can display the data in another way , that clearly shows that there is in fact only one power law ( with corrections towards the viscous end ) .",
    "consider ( fig.[f : slop1 ] , where we have plotted the logarithms of the quotients between enstrophies of two succesive shells .",
    "let us recall that if the energy spectrum goes as @xmath0 , then the enstrophy spectrum goes as @xmath49 , and the enstrophy content of a shell is constant .",
    "if the shell enstrophy decreases with shell number as @xmath50 , then the base two logarithms of two successive quotients tend to @xmath51 .",
    "it is clear from ( fig.[f : slop1 ] ) that the slope of the spectrum goes down smoothly through the second range , and that one can not associate a second power - law to it .",
    "one may also fit a power - law behaviour with an expontial cut - off to the data .",
    "fig ( [ f : expdata ] ) shows our best fit of the logarithms of shell enstrophies .",
    "clearly this fit is reasonably good in the inertial range with @xmath7 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , good in the far dissipation range , but not very good in the intermediate region . using the slope of the linear fit of fig.[f : speclar ]",
    ", we can get a better fit in the inertial range , at the price of having a much worse fit in the intermediate range .",
    "we therefore conclude that the corrections to the power - law in fig.[f : speclar ] are not exponential , and not a second power - law , but something in between .",
    "we note that there have been earlier discussions of `` spurious '' intermittency corrections@xcite , and that we here have one of the mechanisms reported there : a correction to a power law which is similar to a weaker power - law , is easily mistaken for a power - law with another slope .",
    "the intermittency corrections to the @xmath0-law ( [ law ] ) show up in the behaviour of the structure functions @xmath54 , definded as the space averages of @xmath55-th moment of fluctuations of scale @xmath56 . in the shell model",
    "the structure functions of shell enstrophy are computed as the time average values of corresponding variable in power @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath57      the traditional measure which estimates the deviation of a probability distribution from a gaussian distribution , is the flatness factor , computed as the ratio of fourth moment to the square of second moment , minus three ( the flatness of a gaussian distribution is then zero ) . in our case we compute the flatness factor for the enstrophy on shell @xmath7 as @xmath61 if the flatness factor grows exponentially with shell number , then the growth rate is connected with the exponents in ( [ etadef ] ) @xmath62 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath63 shows the deviation from @xmath59 .",
    "the flatness factors of the distribution of shell enstrophy is shown in fig.[f : flatl ] .",
    "one can here again distinguish the same two sub - intervals of the inertial range as in the energy spectra , only now more pronounced .",
    "the flatness factor increases very slowly in the first interval , approximately with slope @xmath64 in the range @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "this is quite consistent with a small correction to the @xmath0-spectrum . in the range",
    "@xmath66 $ ] a fit gives a value of @xmath67 , i.e. five times higher .",
    "the flatness factor converges much more slowly than the energy spectrum , and we still have significant scatter in fig.[f : flatl ] .",
    "we do not doubt however that the appearent second power law in the flatness factor , is as spurious as was the one in the energy spectrum .",
    "we emphasize that this appearent strong difference in intermittency corrections in different ranges , and in general the spurious power - law range , may in 2d be a property of shell - models only .",
    "shell models are a kind of mean - field theories , and it may be to expect too much that they would reproduce not only the spectrum , but also fluctuations : temporal intermittency in the shell model can be quite different from spatial intermittency .",
    "let us now turn to the question of different shell models ( [ casz ] ) and their spectrum . we have taken the extreme limit and kept in the simulations displayed in fig.([f : differj ] ) only one type of interaction in each ( a run where all are kept is shown for reference ) .",
    "although these models give the same spectral slope ( [ f : differj ] ) , they are in two respects quite different : both in values of their interaction coefficients ; and in the choice of interacting triads .",
    "we therefore conjecture , that the spectral law of 2d - turbulence in shell models , albeit slightly different from the @xmath0 prediction , nevertheless holds for a wide class of models , that inertially conserve two quadratic forms in the shell amplitudes , i.e. is universal .    the curves in ( [ f : differj ] ) with only one type of interaction",
    "are shifted relative to the reference run .",
    "this may be understood as follows : the full model transports enstrophy more effectively through the spectrum . in the inertial range ,",
    "the mean value of shell enstrophies is therefore lower . in the dissipation",
    "range the mean value of shell enstrophies is instead higher , because these shells are then driven more intensively by the inertial range .",
    "finally we can try to estimate the kolmogorov  kraichnan constant using ( [ law ] ) .",
    "as in fact the spectrum does not fall off precisely as @xmath0 in the inertial range , we get estimates of @xmath37 that change slowly with @xmath22 . using our normalisation of the shell energy and the data in fig.[f : speclar ]",
    ", we estimate @xmath37 to be 6 and 10 at , respectively , the top ( @xmath68 ) , and the bottom ( @xmath69 ) , of the inertial range .",
    "most of the estimates from numerical studies of the full navier - stokes equations are in the range 4 to 10 .",
    "our shell model therefore seems to give an order of magnitude correct estimate of the overall energy content of 2d  turbulence .",
