    "current optical communications use electronic switching and thus are limited to electronic speeds of a few gigahertz . to reach much higher speeds ,",
    "various proposals have been made including optical networks  @xcite , as well as using all - optical routers  @xcite and switches  @xcite .",
    "also , quantum optical networks were motivated by quantum information ( communication ) , using elements with quantum coherence ( such as superposition and entanglement ) of photons .",
    "thus the elemental device can be implemented as a generalized cavity qed system : a photon confined to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide , and controlled by a quantum switch , made of a two ( or more ) energy - level systems  @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies for such a quantum switch , which could be realized in various physical systems , e.g. , a transmission line  @xcite coupled to a charge qubit  @xcite and a defect cavity waveguide coupled to a quantum dot  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies on these systems are excessively idealized , because the experimental system is never one dimensional .    in order to consider more realistic systems , here we study the finite cross - section effect of the waveguide on the single - photon transport controlled by a two - level system ( tls ) .",
    "we consider the waveguide as a quasi-1d system with a rectangular cross - section .",
    "it is well known that if a photon could be perfectly transported in a quasi-1d waveguide , its frequency must be larger than the cutoff frequency of a certain transverse mode . moreover , to avoid the loss of the photon incident in the lowest transverse mode due to scattering into other modes , people need to make the cross section of the waveguide as small as possible . however , the cross section of realistic waveguides can not be infinitely small , and a waveguide with a finite cross section would allow the photon transit from one transverse mode to another . furthermore ,",
    "if the incident photon frequency is far from the cutoff frequency , such as x ray  @xcite , then the different transverse modes would be so close that the incident photon would be inevitably coupled to higher transverse modes .",
    "this consideration motivates us to study the incident photon transport in one mode while coupled to another ( higher ) mode .",
    "we solve the lippmann - schwinger equation for calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients of a single photon scattered by a tls . since the exact dispersion relation of a photon in a waveguide with finite cross section is more like a quadratic one near the cutoff frequency , quite different from the linear regime , we approximate the exact dispersion relation by a quadratic function of the wave vector of the photon by expanding it to second order in the wave vector .",
    "in such a quadratic waveguide , we find that there is a bound state and two quasibound states for each scattering channel defined by a certain transverse mode .",
    "we note that this bound state does not exist in the usual linear waveguides .",
    "there are three kinds of resonance phenomena , which correspond to the complete reflection of the photon incident in a given channel .",
    "one occurs at the single - photon resonance , namely the incident photon energy is resonant with the tls without coupling to the higher transverse mode .",
    "once the incident photon couples to the higher transverse mode , this resonance phenomenon is replaced by a photonic feshbach resonance , namely a complete reflection occurs when the incident energy of the photon equals the bound - state energy of the higher transverse mode .",
    "the third type of resonance always occurs at the minimum frequency of the quadratic waveguide , whether or not the singe photon is coupled to a higher transverse mode .",
    "this resonance phenomenon is called cutoff - frequency resonance .",
    "we also notice that the transverse mode will lead to an incident photon loss as a result of scattering into other higher channels .",
    "we also compare in detail the results obtained by the linear and quadratic dispersion relations , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the system and the effective hamiltonian , including two transverse modes .",
    "we also derive the second - order dispersion relation .",
    "then , we calculate the single - photon transport in the higher transverse mode without coupling to the incident mode in sec .",
    "we find a bound state and two quasibound states  @xcite by utilizing the quadratic dispersion relation . in sec .",
    "iv , we obtain the single - photon reflection and transmission coefficients with coupling to the higher transverse mode through the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the transverse effect in both linear and quadratic waveguides are discussed in sec .",
    "v. finally , we present our conclusions in sec .  vi .",
    "the setup under consideration is a waveguide - qed system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) consisting of a quasi-1d rectangular waveguide with inner dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 and a two - level atom .",
    "the waveguide supports quantum fields of transverse electric waves @xmath2 , which are described by the annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath3 . here",
    "the natural numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the transverse quantum numbers in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions , while the continuous variable @xmath8 denotes the wavevector along the @xmath9 axis . the eigenmode function of the electric fields in the waveguide can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath10 where we introduce the cutoff wavenumber @xmath11 and the electric field per photon @xmath12 , with frequency @xmath13 and the effective volume @xmath14 of a segment ( with length @xmath15 ) of the waveguide .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath17 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "when a two - level atom is placed in the waveguide , it will couple to these quantum fields via the dipole interaction . denoting the ground and excited states of the atom as @xmath18 ( with energy @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( with energy @xmath21 )",
    ", we can define the atomic transition operators as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and then the hamiltonian ( with @xmath24 ) of the waveguide - qed system reads @xmath25 here , the coupling strength is @xmath26 .",
    "keeping the coupling between photons and atoms @xmath27 nonzero requires @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 , namely the coupling along @xmath7 direction is zero , then the transverse mode quantum number @xmath5 should be nonzero , namely @xmath30 ; otherwise , if @xmath31 , namely the coupling along @xmath6 direction is zero , then the transverse mode quantum number @xmath4 should be nonzero , namely @xmath32 .",
    "when the transverse sizes satisfy @xmath33 , then the modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , bearing the same cutoff frequencies , are degenerate .",
    "to mainly show our idea , namely the effect induced by transverse size of the waveguide , we will choose two modes with different cutoff frequencies .",
    "the relation @xmath36 gives the exact cutoff frequency @xmath37 for the transverse mode @xmath38 .",
    "( color online ) schematic diagram for single - photon transport in a quasi - one - dimensional waveguide coupled to a tls with transition frequency @xmath21 .",

    "therefore , the finite cross - section effect of the quasi-1d waveguide on photon transport can be mainly characterized by the two transverse modes @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "however , the exact dispersion relation  ( [ eq : wmn ] ) near the cutoff frequency is more like a quadratic one , so we expand the frequency @xmath57 around @xmath58 with @xmath59 , and @xmath60 around @xmath61 with @xmath62 , up to second order in @xmath8 . after introducing @xmath63 ( for @xmath57 ) , and @xmath64 ( for @xmath60 ) ,",
    "the two dispersion relations can be rewritten as @xmath65 with the first- and the second - order coefficients given by @xmath66    here , we have introduced @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which is proportional to the size @xmath0 of the cross section .",

    "therefore , the dispersion relations  ( [ eq : wap ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "we note that the terms in the dispersion relation  ( [ eq : wap ] ) that depend on the photon wave vector @xmath82 describe the frequency detuning of the photon from the atom .",
    "later on , we will use the dispersion relations  ( [ eq : wap ] ) in our derivations .",

    "when the transverse size @xmath0 of the waveguide is larger than the critical size @xmath231 , @xmath232 , the transverse mode should be taken into account . for a 1d circuit system with @xmath233  @xcite , then @xmath234 .",
    "for a 3d optical cavity system with @xmath235  @xcite , then @xmath236 .",
    "in addition , when the photon frequency @xmath237 ghz , such as x rays  @xcite , the tls with transition energy @xmath238 ( the nuclear transition of @xmath239 ) , corresponding to @xmath240 , then the critical size becomes @xmath241 . experimentally , this @xmath242 looks too difficult",
    ". therefore , it is very necessary to consider the transverse - mode effect in the single - photon transport in a waveguide with finite cross section .",
    "a finite - cross - section waveguide is closer to our experimental quantum coherent device design and fabrication .",
    "taking advantage of the finite - cross - section waveguide will ease the stringent requirements on realizing quantum - coherent devices .",
    "we studied the finite cross - sectional effect of the waveguide on single - photon transport . to mainly characterize the finite cross - section effect of the waveguide , we pick out one of the numerous transverse modes , whose eigenfrequency is closest to that of the transport mode .",
    "we consider the transport properties of a single photon in such a finite cross - section waveguide by calculating the transmission , reflection coefficients and the single - photon loss probability . by using a quadratic dispersion relation ,",
    "we find a bound state and two quasibound states  @xcite emerging in such a waveguide with a finite cross section , which will not occur in the usual linear waveguide .",
    "moreover , when the input photon energy is resonant with the bound - state energy in the transverse mode , the photon will be completely reflected .",
    "this is the photonic feshbach resonance .",
    "in addition , the input photon is also completely reflected when the input energy of it is at a single - photon resonance with the tls or at the cutoff frequency allowed by the approximated quadratic waveguide .",
    "the photonic feshbach resonance and the cutoff frequency resonance phenomena do not occur in a linear waveguide even in an infinitely idealized 1d waveguide .",
    "furthermore , as a result of transverse - mode coupling , the photon will be lost when the input energy is above the maximum bound - state energy regulated by the coupling strength between the transverse mode and the tls .",
    "therefore , only when the input energy is below this maximum bound - state energy , the single photon can safely pass through or be completely reflected by the tls instead of lost in some other transverse mode even though in a finite cross - section waveguide .",
