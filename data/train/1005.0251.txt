    "the @xmath0-satisfiability problem ( @xmath0-sat ) is well known as nondeterministic polynomial - time ( np ) complete when @xmath2 .",
    "it is the decision problem of whether an instance of boolean variables can be satisfied by variable assignments .",
    "the instance is the conjunction ( @xmath3 ) of clauses and each clause is the disjunction ( @xmath4 ) of @xmath0 numbers of variables ( or negations ) .",
    "determining the @xmath0-sat solvability within reasonable computational time is one of principal unsolved problems in computer science  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is fundamentally important , connected to many applications .",
    "substantial progress of such constraint satisfaction problems ( csps ) has been achieved  @xcite by either numerical or analytical techniques .    since the pioneering work for critical behaviors in the random @xmath0-sat by kirkpatrick and selman  @xcite , mathematics and physics communities have paid attention to structural phase transitions in the solution space , their scaling behaviors , and the exact locations of transition points in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "an instance of the @xmath0-sat can be interpreted as a @xmath0-spin interacting system in statistical physics and its solution as the ground state of the hamiltonian for the corresponding spin system .",
    "based on the interpretation , there are many suggestions for deeper connection between the criticality in the spin - glass theory and the intractability of the np complete problem as well as many conjectures from both fields by trial and error regarding computational hardness .",
    "however , few systematic tests of critical behaviors were presented in the context of finite - size scaling ( fss )  @xcite . in particular , discussions about the fss exponent and the transition nature are rare due to the difficulty in finding exact locations of various transitions in the thermodynamic limit using finite systems , except for @xmath5 where all the transitions occur at the same location as a continuous percolation transition of the solution space .",
    "there are various solving techniques of csps available . for large unstructured csps",
    ", one can solve by either general - purpose deterministic algorithms , e.g. , davis - putnam - logemann - loveland ( dpll )  @xcite ( or more tailored message passing algorithms such belief and survey propagation  @xcite ) , or stochastic - local - search ( sls ) algorithms that are generally competitive for large and least - structured csps , e.g. , the random @xmath0-sat . in sls algorithms ,",
    "assigned values to variables are successively flipped , based on the local information of algorithmic details . starting with the celebrated simulated annealing algorithm by kirkpatrick _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , several focused sls algorithms have been developed : randomwalksat  @xcite , walksat  @xcite , focused metropolis search ( fms )  @xcite , and average sat ( asat )  @xcite .",
    "all the solving techniques , however , have difficulties in approaching a sharp change of the ensemble for random csps , namely a  phase transition \" .",
    "deterministic one , in spite of its exactness , suffers from severely limited system sizes , while stochastic one is able to deal with much larger system sizes but their results are less accurate than the former due to fluctuations and some ambiguity caused by the limited simulation time  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a systematic method to analyze data obtained from finite systems , which can resolve numerical accuracy issues from the limited system size , the method of sampling , and the computational time .",
    "it is based on the fss analysis of nonequilibrium absorbing phase transitions ( apts )  @xcite .",
    "we employ it to characterize critical behaviors of the transition from the solvable [ ( sol ) absorbing ] phase to the unsolvable [ ( unsol ) active ] phase in the random @xmath0-sat , in terms of the density of unsatisfied ( unsat ) clauses as an indicator and a solution as an absorbing state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ k - sat+asat ] , we describe the random @xmath0-sat and explain how to explore it by asat heuristic . in sec .  [ fss ] , we suggest relevant physical quantities , and discuss the main idea of fss ansatz in perspective of nonequilibrium apts .",
    "we also argue scaling properties near and at dynamic sol / unsol phase transitions , which are numerically confirmed well in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] with the summary of the main results and some remarks .",
    "the boolean expression of an _ instance _ @xmath6 in the random @xmath0-sat is written as @xmath7,$ ] where each _ clause _",
    "@xmath8 is given by @xmath9 and each value of @xmath10 is randomly assigned from the set @xmath11 of @xmath12 boolean variables ( themselves and their negation ) .",
    "the above conjunctive norm form of @xmath6 can be also expressed as a bipartite network ( factor graph ) form , too .",
    "the density of constraints ( @xmath13 ) plays the role of a control parameter in the random @xmath0-sat since it can determine the satisfiability  @xcite and the average solving time of algorithms  @xcite . as @xmath14 increases",
    ", it gets harder to find the sat configuration of variables , and eventually the solution does not exist for too large @xmath14 values .",
    "at least one threshold , therefore , must exist between the sat and unsat phases .    using the most recently developed sls algorithm , asat  @xcite",
    ", we systematically show how to find such a threshold value from numerical data of finite systems , denoted as @xmath15 in the thermodynamic limit , as well as critical exponents .",
    "they correspond to the solvability transition point and its critical behaviors , very similar to those of nonequilibrium apts . among lots of algorithms",
    ", asat deserves to be considered the representative case of our new fss analysis because it is not only the most efficient focused sls heuristic but also the simplest variant of well - known algorithms with the specific value of the noise parameter of asat , e.g. , randomwalksat .",
    "since our main interest is the minimal model study of the random @xmath0-sat , we here present only the results of asat and its limiting case , randomwalksat , but our analysis techniques can be easily applied to any other algorithms ( partially tested in  @xcite ) . for",
    "those who are interested in the graph coloring problem ( @xmath16-col ) , walkcol in  @xcite would be the best to be tested by the same fss analysis as what we do .",
    "it is because walkcol is the exact adaptation of asat in the random @xmath16-col .",
    "we explore the random @xmath0-sat by asat as follows : choose a clause at random among the set of unsat clauses and then randomly try flipping one assigned value out of @xmath0 variables in the chosen clause .",
    "the trial flip is accepted with certainty unless the total number of unsat clauses , @xmath17 increases , or with a probability @xmath18 ( noise parameter ) if @xmath17 increases . whether each trial flip is accepted or not , time is incremented by @xmath19 . in general",
    ", one takes @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) where @xmath22 is the total number of variables and @xmath23 , so that a unit time interval ( monte carlo step ) corresponds to one trial flip per variable on average .",
    "however , our choice is restricted to unsat clauses only in order to improve the simulation efficiency of asat ( by definition , it is a focused heuristic ) , such that @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the total number of unsat clauses at time @xmath26 .",
    "the simulation is terminated either if a solution is found or if the given instance is not solved yet until the maximal time , @xmath27 .",
    "so far , critical behaviors near the sol - unsol transition have been discussed in terms of the fraction of solved / successful samples , @xmath28 , and the fss exponent @xmath29 that determines the fss width of a continuous phase transition as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "this is based on the fact that there is some diverging correlation volume , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 in finite systems at @xmath34 ) , like the diverging correlation length as @xmath35 ( @xmath36 with @xmath37 in @xmath38-dimensional finite lattices at @xmath34 ) .",
    "one can find the detailed discussion of @xmath29 for non - regular lattice types , complex networks , in  @xcite .",
    "our fss analysis in the random @xmath0-sat follows the postulate of a diverging dynamical correlation volume , @xmath39 , at the solvability transition whose physical manifestation is the presence of dynamical heterogeneities with infinitely many solution states . using the analogy of the fss concept in the static simulations of nonequilibrium apts , we measure two more physical quantities , ( besides the solved - sample fraction , @xmath40 ) , playing roles as good and independent indicators in sls algorithmic phase transitions : the solving time and the density of unsat clauses .",
    "the solving time , @xmath41 , can be determined in two ways from @xmath42 for @xmath43 : ( 1 ) @xmath44 when @xmath45 , corresponding to the median value of the solution time set .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath46 $ ] , where [ @xmath47 denotes an average restricted to sol trials before @xmath27 out of all trial samples .",
    "since both are well defined in the sol phase ( @xmath48 ) , they indicate the transition into the unsol phase ( @xmath49 ) for @xmath50 as @xmath51 , like the relaxation time in apts . incorporating the size dependence generally yields @xmath52 , where @xmath53 for large @xmath54 and @xmath55 at @xmath34 with @xmath56 . in the sol phase ,",
    "@xmath41 approaches a constant as @xmath57 , while in the unsol phase it grows exponentially with @xmath22 .",
    "it is noted that we present @xmath58 only .",
    "the density of unsat clauses , @xmath59 , plays a role of another good indicator in the solvability transition of the random @xmath0-sat , namely , `` active clause '' density as if the order parameter of apts . in applying fss to its critical behaviors",
    ", one should notice that the true stationary state of a finite system is only the sol state . to learn about the unsol state from algorithm tests ,",
    "one should investigate the quasistationary state describing the statistical properties of unsol trials with some initial transient , and determine such quasistationary properties from averages over unsol representatives out of a large independent trial set with random initial conditions .",
    "after the initial transient ( depending on both @xmath14 and @xmath22 ) , @xmath60 which gets saturated to @xmath61 for @xmath62",
    ". here @xmath63 corresponds to an average restricted to unsol trials and @xmath64 to an average of saturated steady values .",
    "near the transition for small @xmath65 and large @xmath22 , the survival unsat density is written in the fss form , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in the sol phase",
    ", it trivially scales as @xmath70 , so @xmath71 for negatively large @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath15 value may also be found by examining its @xmath22-dependence as @xmath72 since in the sol phase , it falls off as @xmath73 , while in the unsol phase , it approaches an @xmath14-dependent value .    finally , we explain the dynamic scaling of @xmath74 , averaged over survival trials at @xmath15 with random initial configurations , where the time dependence only involves the ratio @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 .",
    "it is , however , hard to observe the saturated regime for @xmath77 as @xmath22 increases , so it is better to focus on the temporal decay regime for @xmath78 with the largest @xmath22 value one can test , which enables to determine both @xmath15 and @xmath79 at the same time with the pretty good accuracy .",
    "this is why @xmath80 should be first investigated without any assumption of the @xmath81 value : @xmath82 , where @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath68 .    [",

    "we have analyzed the random @xmath0-sat by the simplest sls heuristic in the numerical framework of nonequilibrium apts .",
    "two possible values of the fss exponent ( @xmath29 ) in 3-sat are conjectured : one is @xmath86 in the _ directed percolation _",
    "university class with infinitely many absorbing states  @xcite if @xmath87 .",
    "the other is @xmath88 in the _ percolation _ university class ( same as 2-sat ) if @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the condensation and clustering threshold and @xmath91 is the sat - unsat threshold  @xcite , which are numerically confirmed with logarithmic corrections to scalings .    in conclusion",
    ", we have a few remarks for further studies : dealing with numerical data in @xmath0-sat , one should know serious finite - size effects of small systems , @xmath92 .",
    "the fss analysis we tested here would be widely applicable to test constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) algorithms performance .",
    "the validity check of our results and methods could be possible in the graph @xmath16-coloring problem ( @xmath16-col ) .",
