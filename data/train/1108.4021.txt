    "in the context of modified gravity theories , where the dynamical measurements usually ascribed to the presence of dark matter are interpreted as evidence for a change in the form of gravity , stellar populations in the galactic halo have proven to be critical test grounds . the relative proximity of many such systems makes them accessible to detailed photometric and spectroscopic kinematical observations , while the total absence of gas in the cases of many dwarf spheroidal satellites ( dsph ) and globular clusters , implies these objects present a relatively clean test , as only the measured stellar component must be responsible for the measured dynamics , in the absence of any dark matter .",

    "it is this last which we will be using in what follows , to construct equilibrium models for globular clusters .",
    "recently , bernal et al . (",
    "2011 ) showed this modified force law model to be the low velocity limit of a formal generalisation to gr of the @xmath30 type , providing a theoretical basis for the model used .",

    "the above is a generalisation of the treatment presented in hernandez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which we used in the modelling of dsph galaxies , which are characterised by flat velocity dispersion profiles , obtaining mass models consistent with observed velocity dispersions , half mass radii and total masses , in the absence of dark matter .",

    ", we obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the expected tully - fisher scaling of the circular equilibrium velocity with the fourth root of the mass , with rotation velocities which remain flat even after the mass distribution has converged , rigorously isothermal halos are naturally limited in extent . it is interesting to note that in this limit the scaling between the circular rotation velocity and the velocity dispersion is only slightly modified as compared to the newtonian case , the proportionality constant changes from 2 to 3 , for the squares of the velocities . in astrophysical units ,",
    "this low acceleration limit for an isothermal halo in gravitational equilibrium yields :    @xmath53    @xmath54    for the velocity dispersion and the centrifugal equilibrium velocities of a halo of total mass @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "also , it must be borne in mind that galactic globular clusters are not in isolation , but orbit within the galactic environment .",
    "this leads to a radius beyond which the tidal forces of the milky way unbound the outer stars of a globular cluster , which depends on the mass and orbital radius of the gc in question .",
    "the above tidal radius can be calculated to first order for a point mass orbiting another point mass by equating the internal gravitational force of the gc to the derivative of the galactic gravitational force , we briefly recall the first order tidal limit calculation of :    @xmath56    which leads to the tidal density stability condition of @xmath57 for the density of a satellite of extent @xmath58 and mass @xmath59 orbiting at a distance @xmath60 from the centre of a spherical mass distribution @xmath61 having an average matter density @xmath62 internal to @xmath60 resulting in a gravitational force @xmath63 , where the internal gravitational force under newton is @xmath64 , under the assumption @xmath65 .",
    "the equivalent calculation under the force law given by the @xmath14 limit of @xmath66 is given by :    @xmath67    leading to :    @xmath68    as the equivalent of the classical tidal density criterion .",
    "in terms only of masses and radii we obtain the tidal radius as :    @xmath69    since the spatial extent of globular clusters will always be much smaller that their galactocentric radii , equation(10 ) shows that under the modified gravitational force law explored here , gcs will be much more robust to tides than under newtonian gravity .",
    "as an example , for a @xmath70 gc orbiting @xmath71 from a @xmath72 mass , corresponding under eq.(7 ) to the @xmath73 of the galactic rotation curve , the tidal radius comes to @xmath74 .",
    "this is relevant as it shows that treating gcs as isolated systems is a self - consistent assumption , within the approach of the modified force law being considered .",
    "recent examples of dynamical modelling of galactic gcs treated as isolated systems can be found in e.g. sollima & nipoti ( 2010 ) and haghi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "taking initial conditions @xmath75 , @xmath76 , when @xmath77 , a constant central density @xmath78 , we can solve the full second - order differential equation ( [ profile ] ) for @xmath7 through a numerical finite differences method , once a model for @xmath37 is adopted",
    ".    solving equation ( [ profile ] ) yields the volumetric profiles for the density and mass , @xmath79 , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath79 is then projected along one dimension to obtain a projected surface density mass profile , @xmath80 . in all that follows",
    "we shall use @xmath6 for radial distances in 3d , and @xmath81 for a projected radial coordinate on the plane of the sky .",
    "@xmath80 can be compared to observed surface brightness profiles once a mass - to - light ratio is assumed .",
    "given the appearance of mass segregation processes in the dynamically evolved stellar populations of galactic globular clusters , volumetrically , the mass - to - light ratio of a real gc will never be strictly constant .",
    "however , given the ages of the stellar populations involved , only a narrow range of stellar masses remain , and further , observed surface brightness profiles are projections on the plane of the sky of the volumetric density profiles .",
    "thus , observed surface brightness measurements towards the central regions of gcs imply an integration across the entire foreground and background of any observed cluster .",
    "this in turn means that the regions where mass segregation is strongest , the central ones , contribute to the projected surface brightness profiles only after being averaged out over lines of sight traversing entirely the cluster in question . even after this averaging process",
    ", the high densities found towards the centre still surely imply m / l values which strictly must be a function of radius , even for the surface brightness profiles @xmath82 .",
    "still , for the reasons described above , it is frequent to compare modelled @xmath80 mass surface density profiles directly to observed projected surface brightness profiles through the use of constant m / l values , e.g. jordi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , haghi et al .",
    "in what follows we will also perform such comparisons assuming constant m / l values .",
    "finally , a projected velocity dispersion profile @xmath83 is constructed through a volume density weighted projection of the volumetric velocity dispersion profile of a model , @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , a proposed model for @xmath37 does not directly give a projected @xmath83 profile , which the model only yields after having solved for the detailed density structure , and the subsequent mass weighted projection of the proposed @xmath37 .",
    "observations provide only the density weighted projected profiles of @xmath37 , integrated along the line of sight , @xmath83 , not the volumetric @xmath37 profiles which we require in equation ( [ profile ] )",
    ". we shall therefore adopt a parametric form for the volumetric velocity dispersion profile , and adjust the parameters to obtain a match to the observed globular cluster properties .",
    "for this we use :    @xmath84    in the above @xmath85 is given directly by the observations as the asymptotic value of the measured projected velocity dispersion profile for each globular cluster , as at large @xmath81 radii , projection effects tend to zero and @xmath86 .",
    "this leaves us with three model parameters to determine : @xmath78 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which we fit to match the observed projected velocity dispersion profiles , as well as central projected velocity dispersion values for each observed globular cluster treated , and comparing the resulting model @xmath80 profiles to the observed surface brightness profiles of any given gc , under the requirement that the @xmath89 ratios used be consistent with detailed inferences from the stellar evolutionary and imf studies of mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) .",
    "we end this section presenting in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , a sample model . in figure",
    "( 1 ) we show the volumetric density profile , which is qualitatively similar to a cored isothermal profile , with the difference that the asymptotic @xmath79 profile at large radii is steeper than the @xmath90 of the newtonian case .",
    "this results in finite total masses and finite half - mass radii even for the asymptotically flat @xmath37 volumetric profiles we adopt , in contrast with the situation in classical gravity , where infinitely extended mass profiles would appear .",
    "this finite profiles are also what appears under the type of modified gravity laws we are treating , even for rigorously isothermal @xmath91 equilibrium configurations , as already pointed out in hernandez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and mendoza et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and as shown in the developments following eq .",
    "figure ( 2 ) gives the corresponding volumetric radial mass profile for the same sample model , indicating again with a vertical line the threshold where @xmath92 .",
    "we see that only @xmath93 of the total model mass lies beyond @xmath92 .",
    "this fraction is distributed over a much larger area having much smaller projected mass surface densities than the central regions interior to the @xmath92 threshold , the ones which are much more easily observed , and over which newtonian gravity accurately holds .",
    "these two figures illustrate the physical consistency of the model , a positive isothermal volumetric velocity dispersion is assumed , integration of eq.(3 ) then yields a volumetric density profile essentially consistent with what would appear under newtonian dynamics in the region interior to @xmath92 , where the force law converges precisely to the standard expression . at large radii",
    "however , the density profile increasingly steepens and naturally reaches @xmath94 at a well defined total radius , as is evident from the convergence seen in figure ( 2 ) .",

    "ngc 6171 a very slight mismatch appears between the models and the observations of the surface brightness profiles at values of @xmath96 a few pc , and for ngc 7078 , over the outer regions , precisely beyond @xmath92 , the model falls below the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "these two last points could be evidence of the failure of some of the assumptions used in these cases , probably the presence of velocity anisotropy in the dynamics of the stars in question .",
    "alternatively , a slight tuning of the assumed volumetric @xmath89 ratios with radius , within entirely plausible ranges , would improve the fits .",
    "rather than introduce a further degree of freedom , we prefer to show that highly adequate fits are easily obtained , for the simplest @xmath97 constant assumption .",
    "we see also the steepening of the surface density brightness profile towards the edge of the clusters , particularly for ngc 288 and ngc 7099 . under newtonian gravity",
    "this feature would be interpreted as a tidal radius , while under the modified force law scheme treated here , it is a natural consequence of the change in gravitational regime , leading to finite matter distributions when @xmath3 and @xmath37 tends to a constant cf . , eq.(5 ) .",
    "a model with a degree of radial orbital anisotropy which varies with radius is an entirely plausible alternative , implying the introduction of a further free function which allows to more accurately reproduce the surface brightness profiles .",
    "we have also chosen not to complicate the model with the inclusion of a @xmath98 profile , and preferred to show that under the simplest isotropic construction , the modified force law we test is capable of adequately reproducing all the observations in five of the cases studied , although slight mismatches appear in three other cases .",
    "in particular , for ngc 7078 , our model requires more mass at large radii , but without an increase in @xmath37 in that region .",
    "this can be trivially accommodated by an increase of kinetic energy at large radius which should not be evident in the observed velocity dispersion , through the inclusion of radial motion , a degree of orbital radial anisotropy appearing beyond 20 pc .    obtaining a good match",
    "required taking a high exponent of @xmath99 in equation ( 3 ) , i.e. , a relatively sharp transition for the generalised force law , which however , remains continuous and differentiable at all points , by construction .",
    "this is in agreement with observed upper limits to deviations from newtonian dynamics at the solar system , models for the galactic rotation curve , and equilibrium models for the local dsphs , as shown in mendoza et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to apply for the modified force law tested here , provided @xmath27 .",
    "essentially this implies that the transition between the newtonian and the `` mondian '' regimes must be fairly abrupt .",
    "in fact , given the form of equation ( 3 ) , the final model becomes independent of @xmath18 for any value of @xmath18 higher than 10 .",
    "we now illustrate the dependence of the models obtained to the assumed force law index @xmath18 .",
    "figure ( 5 ) shows the ratio between the resulting model mass , @xmath22 , to the observed cluster mass , @xmath100 , as a function of the value of @xmath18 used , for best fit models for two illustrative cases , ngc 288 and ngc 6341 , upper and lower curves at the right end , respectively .",
    "the shaded region gives the allowed range of globular cluster mass for a particular choice of stellar population parameters in mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) , if the systematic uncertainties were included , the shaded region would extend , but only upwards , by a factor of about 2 .",
    "we see that obtaining a total model mass in accordance with direct stellar population studies requires taking a value of @xmath101 for ngc 288 , and @xmath102 for ngc 6341 .",

    "can not be expected to change from cluster to cluster , we have taken @xmath99 in all cases .    notice that this value results in a equivalent mond @xmath20 transition function which is fairly abrupt . for comparison ,",
    "most mond transition functions proposed imply a softer transition from the newtonian to the mondian regimes , e.g. the @xmath20 function of bekenstein ( 2004 ) correspond exactly to the force law treated here , with @xmath19 .",
    "a similar result has recently been presented by qasem ( 2011 ) , who analyses laser lunar ranging data to constrain the allowed departures from newtonian gravity at the scale studied , and finds the data rule out most proposed mond transition functions , while our proposal of mendoza et al .",

    "an extreme case is ngc 288 with a @xmath83 profile which is also consistent with observations , but which can not be plotted in figure ( 6 ) , as that low density cluster lies in the @xmath3 regime throughout , and therefore @xmath60 is not defined for it .",
    "notice that no external field effect of mond was included in the dynamical modelling performed , as was also not included in e.g. sollima & nipoti ( 2010 ) .",
    "that accurate mass and velocity dispersion models can be thus constructed , is suggestive of a modified gravity formulation where no such effect appears .",

    "it is clear that the data are consistent with the generic modified gravity prediction of @xmath104 , the slope of the solid line being statistically determined as @xmath105 .",

    "the complex stellar populations it presents , its abnormally high mass , together with the possible presence of an intermediary mass black hole in its centre probably indicate a complex dynamical formation history .",
    "still , its inclusion in the power law fit of figure ( 7 ) only slightly modifies the resulting slope to @xmath106 .",
    "figure ( 7 ) lends credibility to the interpretation of the outer flattening of the observed velocity dispersion profiles as evidence for modifications in the law of gravity . under classical gravity",
    ", one needs to invoke further causal correlations to account for the clear trend appearing in figure ( 7 ) , a more contrived scenario than simply the natural consequence of a shift towards mondian dynamics in globular clusters at scales where @xmath3 . as a comparison ,",

    "that the gcs treated lye somewhat below the prediction of eq.(6 ) is not surprising , as they are by no means structures fully in the @xmath14 regime , most of the mass is partly in the newtonian regime , or in the transition between both , hence the asymptotic velocity dispersions slightly off the results of eq.(6 ) .",
    "we acknowledge that a number of the assumptions going into the modelling remain as such , it is entirely plausible that some might not strictly apply . as already discussed , the case of ngc7078 could be indicative of a certain degree of orbital radial anisotropy appearing towards the outskirts of some of these systems . also , the projected @xmath89 values might have some radial variations , or the flattening of the projected velocity dispersion profiles might simply reflect the presence of contaminating unbound stars , or the effects of tidal heating , as assumed under newtonian interpretations of gc structure e.g. drukier et al .",

    "<S> in the context of theories of gravity modified to account for the observed dynamics of galactic systems without the need to invoke the existence of dark matter , a prediction often appears regarding low acceleration systems : wherever @xmath0 falls below @xmath1 one should expect a transition from the classical to the modified gravity regime . </S>",
    "<S> this modified gravity regime will be characterised by equilibrium velocities which become independent of distance , and which scale with the fourth root of the total baryonic mass , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the two above conditions are the well known flat rotation curves and tully - fisher relations of the galactic regime . </S>",
    "<S> recently however , a similar phenomenology has been hinted at , at the outskirts of galactic globular clusters , precisely in the region where @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> radial profiles of the projected velocity dispersion have been observed to stop decreasing along keplerian expectations , and to level off at constant values beyond the radii where @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed gravitational equilibrium dynamical models for a number of globular clusters for which the above gravitational anomaly has been reported , using a modified newtonian force law which yields equilibrium velocities equivalent to mond . </S>",
    "<S> we find models can be easily constructed having an inner newtonian region and an outer modified gravity regime , which reproduce all observational constraints , surface brightness profiles , total masses and line of sight velocity dispersion profiles . through the use of detailed single stellar population models tuned individually to each of the globular clusters in question , </S>",
    "<S> we derive estimates of the total masses for these systems . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that the asymptotic values of the velocity dispersion profiles are consistent with scaling with the fourth root of the total masses , as expected under modified gravity scenarios . </S>"
