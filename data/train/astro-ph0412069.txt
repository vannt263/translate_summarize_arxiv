    "quoting from the review by lada & lada ( 2003 ) , `` observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant ( 7090  % ) fraction of all stars formed in gmcs '' ( giant molecular clouds ) .",
    "this exciting discovery has deep implications for the stellar distribution function in galaxies , and it is verified at the other extreme of the star - formation scale , namely in violently interacting gas - rich galaxies .",
    "de grijs et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that star cluster formation is a major mode of star generation in galaxy interactions , `` with @xmath0 of the active star formation in encounters occurring in star clusters '' . indeed , the entire milky way ( mw ) population  ii stellar spheroid could have been build - up from a population of star clusters formed during the chaotic early merging epoch of the milky way ( mw ) , with the present - day globular clusters forming the remaining high - mass end of the whole distribution ( kroupa & boily 2002 ) .    in order to assess the implications that the birth of stars in clusters may have on galactic structure and kinematics , we need to get a feeling for the physics of star cluster formation .",
    "this , however , leads us rather rapidly to the limits of our present means , because the formation of star clusters is intimately linked to stellar feedback during the first few  @xmath1  yr .",
    "this is evident empirically through the low star - formation efficiency in cluster - forming cloud clumps of less than 40  per cent ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "the theoretical problem can not be solved today because radiation transfer in a highly dynamic , turbulent hydro - dynamical medium that contains complex chemical networks and magnetic fields is untractable .",
    "todays theory of star - cluster formation is limited to purely hydrodynamic computations ( eg . mac low & klessen 2004 ; bonnell , bate & vine 2003 ) that give an important insight into early fragmentation processes but can not capture the essential physics that act to expose the cluster .",
    "we therefore need to resort to observations to constrain the important physical processes responsible for exposing an embedded cluster .",
    "table  [ tab : kr_eg ] provides a few well studied examples of very young stellar systems , some of which have not yet evacuated their remaining gas .",
    "estimates of the crossing and relaxation times are also indicated  myr ; the relaxation time is @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the characteristic radius and @xmath4 is the stellar 3d velocity dispersion ; @xmath5 are the number of stars and the stellar mass in the cluster .",
    "] , and it can be seen that @xmath6age for the embedded low - mass objects that do not contain massive stars , while the opposite is true for the rich clusters .",
    "the massive clusters are well mixed ( @xmath7age ) but not yet relaxed , so some information from their formation is still evident .",

    "the important lesson from this table is that , while the radii of the objects are always similar , their masses vary by about 5 orders of magnitude . in order to make first steps towards understanding the implications star - cluster birth may have on galactic scales we therefore need to worry about the distribution of @xmath16 ; @xmath3 can be assumed constant for now .",
    "assume a region of a molecular cloud becomes gravitationally unstable and contracts .",
    "contraction appears to occur very rapidly , on a time - scale of 13  myr for a wide range of cloud masses and sizes , ( hartmann , ballesteros - paredes & bergin 2001 ) .",
    "the free - fall collapse time , @xmath17 , for a clump with a radius of 5  pc and a mass of @xmath18 is about 6  ( 0.6 )  myr . as the cloud clump contracts it fragments because the increasing density leads to smaller jeans masses , @xmath19 .",
    "turbulent motions also lead to localised fragments ( mac low & klessen 2004 ) . within the fragments proto - stars form on a time - scale of @xmath1  yr ( wuchterl & tscharnuter 2003 ) and decouple from the hydro - dynamical flow thereby becoming ballistic .",
    "they consequently orbit within the contracting overall cloud clump .",
    "age - dating of the young stars in the onc , for example , suggests that the stars formed over a time - span of about 1  myr ( hillenbrand 1997 ; palla & stahler 1999 ; odell 2001 ; hartmann 2003 ) , and so most of the stars have orbited the forming embedded cluster a few times before star formation was halted , probably due to the emergence of the o  stars . indeed , the short photo - evaporation time - scale of proplyds suggests that the central star @xmath201  c ori with a mass of about @xmath21 may only be a few @xmath22  yr old ( odell 2001 ) .",
    "a similar picture emerges for the r136 cluster ( massey & hunter 1998 ; bosch et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "because most of the stars have orbited a few times until that critical time when the feedback energy from the massive stars ionises the gas throughout the cluster region ( with a typical radius of a few  pc ) thereby mostly halting further star formation , the embedded cluster must be , at that instant , close to dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion is @xmath23 where @xmath24  per cent is the measured star - formation efficiency ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "now note that for @xmath25 since @xmath26  pc while @xmath27 we find that an embedded cluster with the mass of a typical globular cluster has a velocity dispersion characteristic of the thick disk of the mw , and indeed of dwarf galaxies . _",
    "the notion thus emerges that the birth of massive clusters may have an important impact on the structure and internal kinematics of galaxies _ ( kroupa 2002 ) . but this can only be true ( i ) if such large velocity dispersions are actually observed in embedded clusters , and ( ii ) if the embedded velocity dispersion can be carried into the galactic field while the cluster emerges from its cloud core .",
    "observations indicate that condition  ( i ) may well be fulfilled : +    onc : = age @xmath28 1  myr ; @xmath29 = @xmath30  km / s @xmath31  km / s + ( jones & walker 1988 : proper - motion study , 900  stars ) + r136 : age @xmath28 2  myr ; @xmath32  km / s + ( bosch et al .",

    "( 2001 ) line - of - sight value @xmath33  km / s .",
    "the onc ( wilson et al . 1997 ) and probably also r136 ( brandl et al . 1996 ) contain little gas and thus the measured 3d velocity dispersion is probably smaller than the pre - gas expulsion stellar velocity dispersion within the embedded clusters , @xmath34 , since the clusters are probably expanding unless the star - formation efficiency was 100  per cent ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "furthermore , for the onc the velocity dispersion is only a lower limit because the proper motion analysis removes radial and tangential motions . in both clusters the observed stellar mass is too small to account for the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "the measured super - virial nature of the onc has been a puzzle for some time ( jones & walker 1988 ; hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) . the astonishingly high velocity dispersion in r136 is attributed by bosch et al . ( 2001 ) to be the result of the orbital motions of massive companions .",
    "the sample can be split into two mass bins each containing 24  stars . quoting the line - of - sight dispersions and the average mass ,    for @xmath36 = @xmath37 = @xmath38  km / s , + for @xmath39 = @xmath40 = @xmath41  km / s .",
    "if the large @xmath42 were due to orbital motions then the more massive sample ought to have a larger velocity dispersion since on average the binaries have more binding energy . instead @xmath43 which indicates that r136 is mass segregated with a kinematically decoupled core of massive stars .",
    "mass segregation is indeed evident in star - counts of the cluster ( selman et al .",
    "1999 ) , and in a mass - segregated cluster the massive stars are expected to have a lower velocity dispersion",
    ". therefore probably a substantial part of @xmath42 may be due to the motions of stars through the cluster .",
    "both clusters thus appear to be well out of equilibrium and therefore expanding .",
    "observations of the velocities of stars of later spectral type in r136 , and improved proper - motion studies of the onc , are needed to further test this notion .",
    "concerning condition ( ii ) , @xmath4 will be conserved to some degree _ if _ the star - formation efficiency is small ( @xmath44  per cent ) _ and _ gas expulsion occurs on a dynamical time or shorter ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is not easy to verify empirically because we typically do not catch the cluster just at the time when it is expelling its gas , although the @xmath46  myr old treasure chest cluster appears to be doing just that .",
    "smith , stassun & bally ( 2004 ) find the treasure chest cluster to be very compact with a radius of less than 1  pc .",
    "the hii region is expanding with a velocity of approximately 12  km / s such that the cluster volume will be excavated within a few  0.1  myr .",
    "furthermore , the star - burst clusters in the antennae have @xmath47  myr and whitmore et al . ( 1999 ) and zhang , fall & whitmore ( 2001 ) find gas outflow velocities of 2530  km / s .",
    "this corresponds to a gas evacuation time - scale of 0.2  myr which is comparable to @xmath48 .",
    "the star - burst clusters in the antennae galaxies would thus appear to support explosive gas expulsion . taking the evidence from the onc and r136 into account",
    ", it appears that _ in the presence of o  stars explosive gas expulsion may drive early cluster evolution independently of cluster mass_.    another handle on the evacuation time - scale can be obtained by considering the energy input from massive stars and comparing this to the binding energy , @xmath49 , of the nebula .",
    "we have    @xmath50 = @xmath51  erg , + @xmath11 @xmath52 ,    and some characteristic values are listed in table  [ tab : kr_bind ] for @xmath53  pc .",

    "the cluster stars are left orbiting with super - virial velocities and expand nearly freely outwards .",
    "the classical energy argument suggests that such clusters can not survive ( hills 1980 ; boily & kroupa 2003 ) .",
    "basically , pleiades- and hyades - type open clusters ought not to exist , unless the stellar imf with which they were formed had no o  stars ( elmegreen 1983 ; kroupa , aarseth & hurley 2001 , hereinafter kah ) .",
    "this was a very interesting proposition , but subsequent observations showed that clusters with @xmath62 also contain massive stars ; evidence for a truncated imf has never been found .",
    "this problem of not being able to understand how open clusters form in view of ( 1 ) explosive gas expulsion and ( 2 ) @xmath63 , has recently been solved by the advent of @xmath64body work which treats the energy exchanges between stars due to gravitational encounters precisely .",
    "such work has been made possible through theoretical research by sverre aarseth at cambridge and seppo mikkola at turku on finding numerical and arithmetical solutions to the non - linear gravitational dynamics problem ( aarseth 1999 ) . using an amended version of the aarseth integrator nbody6 on a stand - alone pc , kah calculated the evolution of an initially dense embedded cluster containing @xmath22 stars and brown dwarfs , with a 100  % fraction of binaries .",
    "the initial onc model was taken to be the most likely configuration from a parameter survey of all possible dynamical states of the onc ( kroupa , petr & mccaughrean 1999 ; kroupa 2000 ) .",
    "following the seminal work by lada , margulis & dearborn ( 1984 ) , kah modelled the gas component ( initially 2/3rd of the total mass ) as a time - evolving background potential .",
    "this approximation makes the calculations feasible on modern computers and is nicely consistent with the much more cpu intensive sph modelling that also needs to treat radiative energy transfer in a highly simplified way ( geyer & burkert 2001 ) .",
    "the kah models include stellar - evolution - induced mass loss and a solar - neighbourhood tidal field , and thus constitute the most realistic existing computations of all relevant physical processes acting during the emergence of a young cluster from its natal cloud .",
    "the overall evolution of the embedded cluster with o  stars is visualised in fig .",
    "[ fig : kr_lagr ] which shows the reaction of the mass shells to sudden gas removal .",
    "the lagrange radii remain constant during the embedded phase , but during the final stage just before gas expulsion some mass segregation becomes apparent through a contraction of the core radius .",
    "gas expulsion leads to expansion of the lagrange radii , and by 1  myr the theoretical velocity dispersion has dropped to the observed value in the onc .",
    "the radial density profile also matches the observed onc by this time .",
    "the 50  % mass radius expands with a velocity of about 1.2  km / s .",
    "it crosses the tidal radius by about 1  myr by which time about 50  % of the embedded cluster mass becomes unbound .",
    "the inner @xmath65  per cent lagrange radius as well as the core radius contract after a few  myr to reach a new minimum by 10  myr .    a young open cluster has thus formed .",

    "myr it evolves to an object that resembles the pleiades .",
    "theoretical cluster evolution models by portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) furthermore show that the pleiades will evolve to a hyades - like cluster , and so we are left to marvel at the amazing coincidence that within less than one - third of a quadrant on the sky we can see the following evolutionary sequence with the naked eye :    * onc * @xmath67 * pleiades * @xmath67 * hyades * + @xmath68  myr @xmath69  myr +    much more work needs yet to be performed in order to better understand the role of two - body relaxation and binary - star energy exchanges during the critical gas - expulsion phase , and to quantify the function @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the primordial binary proportion , and to include the presence of the molecular cloud behind the onc which is likely to affect the kinematical field .",

    "2004 ) as the conversion of gas to stars proceeded .",
    "the above constitutes a simple example of how clustered star - formation may affect the morphology of galaxies .",
    "the results are very encouraging , in that the constrained parameters @xmath137 are reasonable . combined with the observational evidence discussed in section  [ sec : kr_birth ] the notion that star clusters are fundamental building blocks of galaxies is sharpened . clearly , we need to calculate the velocity distribution function of expanding stellar populations , @xmath138 ) , within a realistic and time - evolving galactic potential in order to construct three - dimensional velocity ellipsoids at different locations in the mw disk and at some given epoch for a pre - scribed star - formation history .",
    "this needs treatment of the diffusion of orbits in the time - evolving potential .",
    "furthermore , ancient thin - disk clusters with @xmath139 may be evident in the mw disk today as evolved cluster remnants ( eq .  [ eq : kr_tev ] ) .",
    "the measured super - virial velocity dispersion of onc and r136 stars suggests that both clusters may be out - of - dynamical equilibrium after blowing out their residual gas explosively .",
    "explosive gas expulsion from massive young clusters is also supported by measurements of the outflow velocities of gas , and the treasure chest cluster may be caught in the act of doing so .",
    "young clusters containing o  stars therefore may expand rapidly after gas blow - out loosing a large fraction of their stars .",
    "this expanding population forms a moving group ( mgi ) with a velocity dispersion , @xmath140 , that is related to the pre - gas expulsion velocity dispersion of stars in the embedded clusters , and thus to the mass , @xmath81 , of the re - virialised cluster that re - contracts as the nucleus of the expanding mgi .",
    "gaia will measure this correlation @xmath141 , through which we will get an important handle on the basic physics acting during cluster formation .    since most stars form in embedded clusters it follows that cluster birth may leave non - negligible imprints in the kinematical and structural properties of galaxies .",
    "an example has been presented by calculating the vertical velocity dispersion of a population of stars born in an ensemble of star clusters .",
    "relating this dispersion to the missing heat source in the age  velocity - dispersion relation of solar neighbourhood stars allows us to estimate the evolution of the embedded - cluster mass function with time .",
    "the result of this exploratory work is that the mw may have been quietening down somewhat , that early epochs of the mw disk may have been characterised by more violent star formation within a thin disk producing clusters reaching to masses similar to those of present - day globular clusters .",
    "a thick disk may thus be a natural outcome of such events .",
    "the merging of cold - dark matter sub - halos may not be needed to explain the existence of a thick disk , but satellite mergers are of course not ruled out as having shaped the old mw disk ( abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) .    a more detailed theoretical study of these processes is needed to quantify the stellar velocity ellipsoid in dependence of various evolutionary models of the mw disk , and to construct statistical models of the mw for future comparison with gaia data .",
    "because this notion that popping clusters may shape entire galaxies is so important , it will also be urgent to observe the velocity dispersion and the gas content in as many very young clusters as is possible . while gaia will have the defining impact on these ideas , it will not be able to measure the kinematics of very young stars in dense clusters , so that ground - based proper - motion and line - of - sight velocity observations are definitely needed to quantify the dynamical state of as large a number of very young clusters as is possible .",
    "the beauty of this entire approach lies in the realisation that small - scale baryonic processes may affect galaxy - scale structures through stellar dynamics .",
    "star - formation scales may thus impact cosmological issues in a hitherto unappreciated manner ."
