    "since the multi - thz response is dominated by the vanadium vibration inherent to the rutile phase , we assume that the anharmonicity of the vo@xmath0 lattice in the excited electronic state is strongly enhanced as compared to the insulating ground state .    the spectral response of vo@xmath0 and its dynamics shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2dmaps](b ) and ( c ) are very similar .",
    "this fact once more convincingly demonstrates the interchangeability of temperature and fluence .",
    "we may thus conclude , that the observed interplay of electronic and phononic degrees of freedom that eventually leads to the emergence of the metallic phase , is not unique to the optically driven case but plays an important role in the thermal transition as well .",
    "[ fig:2dmaps](d ) shows the 2d map measured with an excitation fluence of @xmath38 = 7.5  mj/@xmath15 exceeding a threshold fluence @xmath37 = 5.3  mj/@xmath15 at a temperature @xmath45  k. the spectral response of the optical phonon resonances is qualitatively similar to figs .",
    "[ fig:2dmaps](b ) and ( c ) with the same dynamics characterized by the coherent oscillations [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcuts](a ) ] . in contrast , the dynamics of the electronic photoconductivity differs profoundly : after a resolution - limited onset of @xmath41 due to nearly instantaneous photodoping , the thz conductivity levels off at a high value , indicating the final transition into a metallic phase .",
    "this behavior is seen also in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcuts](b ) where the cross sections of the 2d maps at the energy of 100  mev are shown .",
    "remarkably , at this energy there are no pronounced oscillations imprinted on the electronic conductivity , in contrast to the phononic response .",
    "nevertheless , careful inspection reveals a periodic modulation of the multi - thz response around 90  mev .",
    "this energy range is well above the highest phonon resonance and related to the electronic part of the conductivity .",
    "most clearly , this effect is seen in the cross section of fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmaps](d ) made at an energy of 92  mev .",
    "the oscillating component in this cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcuts](d ) occurs exactly at twice the v - v stretching frequency of 6.1  thz .",
    "moreover , the first three cycles of the oscillation shown in fig .  [ fig:1dcuts](d ) are well described by squaring the fitting function of the 6.1  thz oscillation in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcuts](c ) ( and subtracting an offset ) . for later delay times",
    "@xmath24 the modulation amplitude rapidly decreases and a relation to the coherent wave packet motion can not be traced any more .",
    "the doubled frequency of the oscillation indicates that the dominant term in the electron - phonon coupling of the 6.1  thz phonon mode is quadratic with respect to the phonon normal coordinate .",
    "the red - shift of the oxygen modes is equal in all three investigated cases and hence depends neither on fluence nor temperature .",
    "the same holds for the period of the modulation , which always consistently matches the vanadium 6.1  thz mode , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcuts](a ) .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude of the modulation scales with fluence but hardly depends on temperature at all .",
    "the energy minima of the potential surfaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond to spatial configurations of the v - v dimers in the monoclinic and rutile phases , respectively .",
    "vertical dashed arrows denote franck - condon - type photoexcitation of spin singlets into a conductive state .",
    "( a ) structural relaxation and coherent vibrations about the new energy minimum below the pumping threshold @xmath49 .",
    "( b ) intense excitation above the threshold @xmath50 leads to a structurally assisted collapse of the mobility edge . ]    a qualitative understanding of the experimental observations may be reached using a recent model that describes the electronic structure in thermal equilibrium within a cluster dynamical mean - field theory.@xcite in this picture , the low - temperature insulating phase is regarded as a molecular solid of vanadium dimers embedded in a matrix of oxygen octahedra . to first order",
    ", the correlated electronic state of each dimer may be described by bonding and anti - bonding heitler - london orbitals .",
    "the energy dependence of these states on the nuclear positions ( such as v - v separation ) is depicted schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] .",
    "the minimum of the lower - energy bonding state defines the atomic position in the monoclinic phase .",
    "absorption of a near - infrared photon removes an electron from the bonding orbital , destabilizing the dimer , while the lattice site is left in a vibrationally excited franck - condon state .",
    "symmetry requires that the energy minimum of anti - bonding orbitals should be located near the rutile configuration .",
    "ultrafast photoexcitation thus launches a coherent structural deformation of excited dimers followed by oscillations of @xmath44 symmetry around the new potential minimum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the appreciable lattice deformations impose strong distortions on the surrounding oxygen octahedra and shift their resonance frequencies .",
    "a similar effect has been reported in carbon nanotubes.@xcite remarkably , the frequency shift is very pronounced for the oxygen vibrations polarized perpendicular to the @xmath34 axis ( modes at 62 and 74  mev ) and relatively weak for the phonon mode at 50  mev polarized along the @xmath34 axis .",
    "this fact attests to an anisotropic character of the anharmonic coupling between normal modes of the vanadium and oxygen sublattices .",
    "since the oscillation period of the oxygen - related phonon modes is shorter by a factor of three as compared to the inverse frequency of the @xmath44 vibration , the eigenfrequencies may follow the structural changes of the vanadium dimer adiabatically .",
    "our experiment directly demonstrates the influence of a coherent lattice motion on other phonon resonances : an overall red - shift of the oxygen modes attests to a modified average structure of the vanadium dimers , while the coherent modulation at 6 thz reflects large - amplitude oscillations about the new potential minimum in the excited state .",
    "although additional shifts of infrared - active phonon modes may be expected from screening via delocalized charge carriers , the distinctly different decay times of electronic and phononic conductivity prove that this effect is not dominant [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcuts ] ] .",
    "the density of excited dimers scales linearly with the laser fluence and so does the amplitude of the observed coherent modulation . on the other hand",
    ", the lattice temperature has no measurable influence on the coherent modulation of the oxygen modes .",
    "the model also provides an instructive explanation of the transient electronic conductivity .",
    "photodoping leaves the dimers initially in a higher - energy state with delocalized electronic character ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) generating a quasi - instantaneous onset of electronic conductivity .",
    "structural distortion drives the dimers into a new energy minimum .",
    "the rapid non - exponential decay of the electronic conductivity seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcuts](b ) indicates that the structural deformation shifts the energy of excited dimers below a mobility edge for extended electronic states [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] .",
    "this process is analogous to a self - trapping of excitons considered by dexheimer et al.@xcite although self - trapped states do not contribute to the electronic conductivity , their structural distortions manifest themselves by the anharmonic shift of oxygen - related phonon modes that persist for at least 1  ps [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : osc1d](a ) ] . on the other hand , at high enough pump fluences electronic conductivity does not decay rapidly .",
    "we suggest long - range cooperative effects to account for this finding : strong distortions that locally map onto the rutile lattice are expected to adiabatically renormalize the electronic bands@xcite and lower the mobility edge . due to the enhanced critical fluctuations at elevated temperatures",
    "the system is more susceptible to this renormalization in accord with experimentally observed lowering of the critical fluence upon approaching @xmath1 .    instead of the persistent coherent modulation at the frequency of the @xmath44 vibration , a weak modulation of the electronic conductivity at the doubled frequency is observed .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation rapidly vanishes after about three oscillation cycles [ fig .",
    "[ fig : osc1d](d ) ] .",
    "this behavior suggests that the lowest - order term in the coupling between the @xmath44 mode and the electronic conductivity band of the photoexcited state is proportional to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the deviation of the dimer coordinate from the metastable rutile structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "since , in a first approximation , this coupling is rather weak , the electronic system may be considered as decoupled from the ionic motion in the non - equilibrium regime after the photoinduced insulator - metal transition .",
    "consequently , the long - lived high value of electronic conductivity can not originate from the continuing motion of the v - v dimers .",
    "instead , we propose to explain this feature by the collapse of the mobility edge@xcite below the fermi energy [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) ] . in this picture",
    ", the critical pump fluence @xmath37 determines whether self - trapping or cooperative delocalization of electron - hole pairs prevails .",
    "the ultrabroadband thz experiments presented here allow us to directly trace the the temporal evolution of the electronic conductivity and the optical phonon resonances during the transient formation of the metallic phase in vo@xmath0 .",
    "this study reveals fingerprints of a coherent v - v intradimer wave packet motion at 6.1 thz which couples anharmonically to infrared - active phonon modes .",
    "the coherent response of the crystal lattice is explained within a model description of local v - v dimers photoexcited into an antibonding state .",
    "the electronic conductivity shows a weak quadratic coupling to the coherent wave packet motion .",
    "a threshold fluence of the excitation pulse for the photoinduced transition is found to decrease as the equilibrium lattice temperature @xmath23 approaches the transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "below threshold , the electronic correlations remain undisturbed and the mid - infrared conductivity vanishes on a sub - picosecond time scale . above a critical excitation density ,",
    "a cooperative insulator - metal transition occurs on a timescale set by the first half of the oscillation cycle of the v - v coherent wavepacket motion in the excited state . in",
    "so far , the data indicate a strong structural component of the phase transition mechanism . however , right after the transition to the metallic phase the electronic system is rendered insensitive to the continuing coherent wave packet motion .",
    "thus the stabilization of the metallic phase must originate from a different mechanism , most likely a collapse of the mobility edge due to the cooperative modification of the electronic band structure .",
