    "the aim of the rapid temporal survey ( rats ) is to discover objects whose optical intensity varies on timescales of a few mins to several hours ( ramsay & hakala 2005 ) .",
    "the prime aim is to discover interacting ultra - compact binary systems - systems consisting of two degenerate ( or semi - degenerate ) stars orbiting around a common center of gravity - with binary orbital periods less than @xmath070 mins .",
    "our pilot set of data was obtained from la palma in nov 2003 using the isaac newton telescope and the wide field camera : it covered 3 square degrees and reached a depth of @xmath422.5 .",
    "nearly 50 sources were found to show significant intensity variations : none were previously known variable objects ( ramsay & hakala 2005 ) . however , only 4 objects showed modulations which varied on periods of approximately 1 hour or less .",
    "table [ sources ] shows the positions and modulation periods , while in figure [ finding ] we show the finding chart for each object . this paper reports followup observations of these 4 systems , the aim being to determine their nature .",
    "we obtained photometric and spectroscopic observations of our targets using the nordic optical telescope ( not ) in visitor mode and the william herschel telescope ( wht ) in service mode : both are located on the island of la palma .",
    "photometric observations were also obtained using the greek kryoneri 1.2 m telescope - the data was of lower signal to noise than the data obtained using the not and so are therefore not discussed in detail .",
    "a log of our observations is shown in table [ log ] .",
    "the data taken using the not were made using alfosc which allows both photometric and spectroscopic data to be taken .",
    "the ccd was windowed to reduce readout time .",
    "( 8,11 ) ( -1.3,-0.4 )    photometric data taken using the not were made using white light ( in the case of rat j0455 + 1305 ) and in @xmath5 filters ( rat j0449 + 1756 ) .",
    "the exposure times were 15 sec , 20 sec and 30 sec for the white light , @xmath6 band and @xmath7 band data respectively . in all bands the dead time was @xmath08 sec .",
    "spectra were obtained of all 4 targets and taken using relatively low resolution grisms ( table [ log ] ) .",
    "this resulted in spectra with resolutions between @xmath0518 .",
    "the spectra obtained using the wht were made using both the red and blue arms of isis .",
    "all data were reduced and analysed using the usual procedures .",
    ".the objects for which we present photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "we show the co - ordinates ( j2000 ) , the modulation period and the @xmath8 or @xmath6 band mag .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , < , > \" , ]     [ sx_spec ]    ( 8,6.7 ) ( -1.0,-0.5 )    we estimate their approximate distance using the relationship of nemec et al ( 1994 ) : @xmath9}$ ] , which is appropriate for sx phe stars pulsating in the fundamental mode . for a period of 1 hr and @xmath10}$]=2 ,",
    "the above relation predicts @xmath11=3.3 . for the apparent brightness of rat j0455 + 1254 and rat j0807 + 1510 ( table [ sources ] ) we find approximate distance of 3.5 and 2.6 kpc respectively . for galactic latitudes of @xmath12 and + 23@xmath13",
    "we find that the sources are displaced from the galactic plane by 1.1kpc and 1.0kpc for rat j0455 + 1254 and rat j0807 + 1510 respectively : this is several scale - heights above the galactic plane .",
    "we have obtained followup optical photometry and spectroscopy of 4 sources which were found to show intensity modulations on timescales of less than @xmath01 hr in our pilot rats dataset .",
    "we find that the source which shows the shortest period ( 374 sec ) , rat j0455 + 1305 , is an ec 14026 star .",
    "we have modelled its balmer absorption lines and find a temperature of 29200k@xmath141900 k and a gravity of @xmath15 .",
    "this places rat j0455 + 1305 at the cool side of the ec 14026 instability strip .",
    "the other sources have spectra which indicate temperatures between 7200 - 7500k .",
    "this together with their optical light curves and infra - red colours strongly suggest they are sx phe stars .",
    "there are currently around 20 ec 14026 stars , while there are less than 20 currently known sx phe stars which are not associated with globular clusters , open clusters or external galaxies .",
    "the usual method of discovering ec 14026 stars is a three - step process .",
    "candidate stars are discovered using colour or prism surveys .",
    "spectroscopy is then required to confirm their classification and determine their temperature and gravity .",
    "lastly , high speed photometry is needed to search for variability .",
    "we have found that our ` reverse ' strategy is a good method of discovering variable ec 14026 stars .",
    "further , our strategy appears to be a good method of discovering sx phe stars , which should help determine their space density and period distribution .",
    "observations were made using the nordic optical telescope and the william herschel telescope on la palma and the kryoneri telescope in greece .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the support of each of the observatories staff . some of the data presented here have been taken using alfosc , which is owned by the instituto de astrofisica de andalucia ( iaa ) and operated at the nordic optical telescope under agreement between iaa and the nbifafg of the astronomical observatory of copenhagen .",
