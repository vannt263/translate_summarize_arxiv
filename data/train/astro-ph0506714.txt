    "it is well known that in inflationary cosmology the early universe turns out be depleted of its matter content at the end of inflation era .",
    "so a mechanism is necessary in order to fill up the universe with baryonic matter ( baryogenesis ) , as well dark matter . in current models",
    ", matter must be generated at a very high temperature , after the inflation era , in order to start baryogenesis .",
    "a mechanism , firstly proposed by traschen and brandenberger @xcite and independently by dolgov and kirilova @xcite based on parametric resonance ( pr ) phenomenon @xcite , succeed to provide such requirements as a possible way to generate matter in pos - inflationary universe with an exponential particle production .",
    "few years later , kofman _",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that this mechanism is effective mainly in the so - called preheating phase of the inflation era .",
    "the simplest model in field theory consists of two boson fields , namely , a self - interacting source field @xmath0 and a resonant ( or matter ) field @xmath1 . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the source field @xmath0 can be obtained as solution of an ordinary second order nonlinear differential equation .",
    "periodic solutions are founded when the field @xmath0 is in the oscillatory regime around the minimum of its potential ( for example , in @xmath2 model ) . in the simplest ( spatial homogeneous ) case",
    ", one looks for periodic solutions which in turns enter in the ordinary linear ( time ) differential equation of the matter field @xmath1 as a periodic potential .",
    "these linear equations are particular cases of the so called hill s equation @xcite .",
    "the important point for these models is that hill s equation presents , in its parameter space , instability regions , also named resonant bands . in a resonance band",
    "the amplitude of a @xmath1 solution can grow exponentially and , since the particle number is proportional to this amplitude one obtains a huge number of @xmath1 quanta @xcite . if @xmath1 is a boson field , the particle number occupation with a specific momentum is exponentially large .",
    "on the other hand , dolgov and kirilova @xcite showed that the pr mechanism is not very effective ( particle production is not exponential ) for fermions field due to pauli blocking and the solutions presents only a polynomial growth .",
    "few years ago , garca - bellido and kusenko @xcite proposed that the same pr mechanism could be used to explain the huge energy coming from `` point - like '' sources in the sky , i.e. the so - called cosmic ray bursts . in order to obtain the needed potential , bounded from below ,",
    "the above authors took the collision of two neutron stars ( ns ) which , merging in each other produce a very compact object whose proton matter inside turns out to be superconductor and can be modelled by a ginzburg - landau potential @xcite .",
    "in addition , they took electromagnetic field as a resonant field interacting with the superconductor matter .",
    "so , when the system is in the pr regime a huge burst of energy is transferred from superconductor matter to the electromagnetic field in form of high energy photons and these , in principle , could be detected on the earth as cosmic ray bursts .",
    "as far as we known this was the first application of the pr mechanism in order to explain the bursts coming from compact objects in the sky .",
    "nevertheless we wonder whether pr can be applied , not to the spectacular collision of two ns , but to a single star itself in a more moderate energy scale , of course .",
    "this was motivated , after walecka s pioneering work @xcite on quantum field theory applied to stellar structure .",
    "so , differently from the above cited researchers , we apply the pr mechanism to a single ns , whose part of its matter content in the core has supranuclear densities .",
    "we are mainly interested in the regime in which matter in the star medium is populated with negative pion described by a field in a condensate phase @xcite which oscillates around the minimum of its potential as required by the pr mechanism .",
    "this oscillation is a natural consequence of the energy excess coming from the formation of the pion condensate , that is , the system to turns in a condensate phase must reduces its energy and therefore is plausible to suppose that this excess is then transferred to the condensate field causing its motion . as in garca - belido and",
    "kusenkos s model , the role of resonant field is played by the electromagnetic field interacting with this oscillatory field .",
    "we shall show below that the proposed model leads to a very efficient , although not thermal , photoproduction .",
    "we expect that in a second phase ( quite the same as in inflationary cosmology ) the production will thermalize with the surrounding matter and consequently changing the equation of state ( eos ) of matter inside the star .",
    "of course , a careful study of energy transport is needed in order to evaluate the impact of this kind of photoproduction to the star evolution . in this work",
    "we just show that parametric resonance is a plausible mechanism for the pion - photon model leading to an anomalous and fast energy production in the interior of compact stars .",
    "the new , nevertheless important , questions above mentioned deserve , of course , a careful further study .",
    "neutron stars have provided us with information on the properties of high density nuclear matter . accumulated data",
    "have given useful information about reliable eos and thermal properties of the ns nuclear matter which seem to suggest the appearing of some phase transitions there , e.g , pion condensation .",
    "the eos then can be used to determine ns parameters , most notably the mass - radius relationship and the maximum allowable mass @xcite .",
    "an interesting phase transition that can take place inside a ns is the pion condensation .",
    "this possible condensation is due , to a large extent , to the high density of the neutron star medium .",
    "the possibility of pion condensation in nuclear or neutron matter was initially proposed by migdal @xcite , sawyer @xcite and scalapino @xcite .",
    "whether pion condensate exist or not is of great interest since it can significantly enhance the cooling rates of ns @xcite .",
    "a very fast cooling for ns may be explained by a possible pion condensation @xcite .",
    "pr mechanism start to work just after the condensate is formed as we shall show in the following sections .",
    "condensed phase of negative pion ( @xmath3 ) can take place if we neglect the strong pion correlations with ordinary matter in modifying the pion self energy .",
    "it is possible to show ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the favorable condition to this assumption is satisfied for a neutron on the top of the fermi sea to turn a proton and @xmath3 when    @xmath4    where @xmath5 @xmath6 is the @xmath3 rest mass .",
    "when this occurs , we say that the negative pion macroscopically occupy a single mode in its ground state , that is , they are in a condensate state",
    ".    the @xmath7 condensation can take place also , since its effective mass in the medium is zero @xcite .",
    "thus , the decay reaction occurs    @xmath8    possible condensation of positive pion ( @xmath9 ) will not taken into account here since sawyer and yao @xcite had showed that in ns medium the number of @xmath9 particles is much smaller than the @xmath3 particles .",
    "therefore , even when @xmath9 condensation occurs it could be neglected when compared with the @xmath3 condensation .",
    "neutral pion does not interact with the electromagnetic field of the ns and the @xmath9 condensate will does not affect the electromagnetic field in significant way , considering the above argument .",
    "so , for the photoproduction , in our case , we can take into account only the interaction between the negative pion condensate and the electromagnetic field of the ns .",
    "henceforth , we will indistinctly use the wording pion condensate as @xmath3 condensate .",
    "in order to get a @xmath3 condensate we will use the lagrangian formalism for the linear @xmath10 model .",
    "although the linear @xmath10 model is a toy model it is enough , for our purposes , to do a qualitative study of the pr phenomenon .",
    "we start by considering the lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field @xmath11 , the isoscalar @xmath10 , the isotriplet @xmath12 , and the nucleon isodoublet @xmath13 @xcite :    @xmath14    where    @xmath15    is the electromagnetic field contribution ,    @xmath16    is the @xmath10 contribution . note that @xmath17 term is responsible for the spontaneous symmetry breaking in this model .",

    "the constants in the lagrangian density can be related ( in tree approximation ) to the physical quantities @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath5 @xmath6",
    "@xcite :    @xmath33    note that if we add a symmetry breaking term in the @xmath25 lagrangian density , instead in @xmath10 lagrangian , then different constants must be defined @xcite .",
    "finally @xmath34 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the nucleon mass ( typically @xmath37 @xmath6 ) .",
    "usually the mass of @xmath10 meson is taken as bigger than 1 @xmath38 @xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", we take @xmath39 @xmath6 , and then we get @xmath40 @xmath6 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 . _ a priori _ we do not have information about the @xmath10 meson and in the ns medium we have a lot of candidates to be the `` @xmath10 meson '' @xcite . since this is a qualitative study we choose this value for @xmath44 due the mass of @xmath0 meson , whose mass is around @xmath45 @xmath6 .",
    "harrington and shepard @xcite , using ( [ 1 ] ) , showed that the pion condensate and the strong electromagnetic field of a ns may co - exist in a particular region ( shell ) inside of the compact star , as well nucleons .",
    "they showed also that the pion condensate can assume a superconducting behavior , even in the presence of an intense electromagnetic field . according , we assume in this work that the pion condensate and the electromagnetic field may co - exist inside of the ns , as showed by the authors of @xcite . in terms of harrington and shepard s",
    "work the pion condensation , without a superconducting phase transition , occurs when the neutron star magnetic field @xmath46 is weaker than some critical low value , @xmath47 .",
    "this sets the basis for our physical model .",
    "now , parametric resonance phenomenon belongs to a class of ordinary linear second order differential equation called hill s equation @xcite .",
    "this class possess two distinct important cases ( but they are not the only ones , of course ) : the mathieu s and lam s ones . in the context of particle production by the pr mechanism ,",
    "mathieu s equation was firstly used by traschen and brandenberger @xcite and dolgov and kirilova @xcite and lam s equation by kofman _ et al _ @xcite . following the above authors we find the equation of motion ( eom ) for the pion condensate and its periodic solutions which , in turn , enter as periodic potentials in the eom for the electromagnetic field . these are hill s equations whose the most useful ones are the mathieu and lam types as mentioned above .",
    "the specific eom for @xmath11 depends only on the form of periodic solution for the pion condensate eom .",
    "if its periodic solution is a simple trigonometric function then the @xmath11 s eom is classified as mathieu s type ; if its solution is an elliptic function , the eom is classified as lam s type . for both types ,",
    "solutions for @xmath11 s eom are guaranteed by a floquet s theorem @xcite and the behavior ( growth ) of a particular solution is determined , basically , by its floquet exponent . if the floquet exponent is a real number , the solutions are unstable , i.e. , they present resonant bands in their parameter space in which the solutions growth ( or decay ) exponentially . in the case of imaginary number ,",
    "the solutions are stable ( bounded ) .",
    "so , in order to find the eom for the electromagnetic field we must find firstly the eom to the @xmath3 condensate , applying the euler - lagrange equations in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we get ,    @xmath48{\\pi^-}+\\lambda^2{\\pi^+}(\\pi^-)^2+ig\\sqrt{2}\\bar{\\psi}[{\\tau_-}\\gamma^5]\\psi=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 and the back reaction of @xmath11 field over @xmath3 condensate was neglected . as mentioned above",
    ", our purpose is to study the effects of @xmath3 condensate over the @xmath11 field and then investigate the pr phenomenon inside of an isolated ns .",
    "back reaction of @xmath11 field can affect the evolution of @xmath3 condensate , but we expect , in a first order approximation , that this contribution may be neglected as in the preheating phase of the inflationary cosmology @xcite",
    ".    the @xmath7 field does not interact with the @xmath11 field , so we can take it in its ground state    @xmath50    and this implies a non condensation phase to @xmath7 meson @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 condensate is not affected by this assumption since conditions on both condensations are independent , as seen above . now taking the approximation @xmath51 we can neglect the @xmath7 contribution in equation ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "symmetry breaking term presents in @xmath52 ( equation ( [ 1 ] ) ) leads to a @xmath10 condensation prevent us to consider @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "in order to estimate the @xmath10 contribution we take @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a positive real number . following @xcite we may write    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the chiral symmetry angle that gives information about the @xmath10 and @xmath25 condensation .",
    "so ,    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is a real parameter .",
    "then , equation ( [ 3 ] ) reads , after some algebra with the nucleon components ,    @xmath60{\\pi^-}+\\lambda^2{\\pi^+}(\\pi^-)^2-ig\\sqrt{2}{|\\psi_n|}^2=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if we take values previously obtained for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we obtains two distinct cases for equation ( [ 4 ] ) :    @xmath64 ,    @xmath65 .    for the sake of simplicity we can take into account these two inequalities defining    @xmath66    where we have case @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath68 and case @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "so we can write equation ( [ 4 ] ) as    @xmath71    also , as a first approximation , we can consider here a region inside the ns in which @xmath3 condensate has a homogeneous and isotropic distribution .",
    "so , we can neglect spatial contributions and then equation ( [ 5 ] ) may be rewritten as    @xmath72    we will analyze the above equation ( with @xmath73 signs ) in two cases : homogeneous ( @xmath74 ) and inhomogeneous ( @xmath75 ) equation .",
    "we will see that for both signs we get periodic solutions which lead to pr for the electromagnetic field .      neglecting nucleon contributions we can write ( [ 6 ] ) as    @xmath76    this ordinary nonlinear second order differential equation is not in any way a simple one .",
    "it can be solved in terms of weierstrass s elliptic functions @xcite which are periodic .",
    "we can use relation ( [ 2 ] ) and write ( [ 7 ] ) as a real ordinary nonlinear second order differential coupled system :    @xmath77    where the same sign must be taken simultaneously in both equations for the factor @xmath78 .",
    "it is easy to see that system described by ( [ 8 ] ) is symmetric under @xmath79 exchange .",
    "this fact suggests similarities between amplitudes , wavelength and frequencies of @xmath3 and @xmath9 solutions . in the next subsection",
    "we will make a numerical analysis of this system .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the evolution of the system ( [ 8 ] ) for the case @xmath67 with @xmath80 @xmath32 and @xmath81 @xmath32 .",
    "these values were obtained when @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . since @xmath68 , these values can be completely arbitrary ( recall , @xmath84 always ) .",
    "we took some values for @xmath85 as one pion mass and three pion mass , approximately , just for numerical analysis . _ a priori _ ,",
    "any real positive value for @xmath85 may be used .",

    "the auxiliary @xmath28 and @xmath29 have a periodic behavior .",
    "therefore , as a direct consequence of this fact , the pion condensate will have a periodic behavior by ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "but it is still necessary to know what kind of regularity we have : a trigonometric one or an elliptic one .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the phase space @xmath88 for the case @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the phase space for @xmath88 for the case @xmath69 .",
    "both pictures confirm the periodic behavior of solutions for @xmath28 and @xmath29 and suggest us that periodic solutions shown in figure [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] have an elliptic function behavior , that is , they could be described by jacobi s elliptic functions . therefore , as we will see , hill s equation that comes out from ( [ 1 ] ) for the @xmath11 s eom is , in fact , a lam s equation whose solutions are of elliptic type .    it must be observed that ( [ 8 ] ) is an ordinary second order differential nonlinear coupled system and this may imply a strong dependence on a given set of initial conditions . alongside this paper",

    "this fact is in complete agreement with the above numerical analysis .",

    "were substituted in equation ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "all solutions that we found for the nonlinear field ( source ) are periodic and substituting them in ( [ 21 ] ) we got a hill s equation . for the sake of simplicity , below",

    "now , using ( [ 14 ] ) , equation ( [ 21 ] ) can be written as    @xmath194{\\chi_k}(t)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath195    this is , clearly , a lam s equation which is easier to handle than the another ones above .",
    "in this case we get just one equation . using ( [ 12 ] )",
    "equation ( [ 21 ] ) may be written as    @xmath196}sn^2\\right]{\\chi_k}(t)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath197}sn^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    represents its mass oscillation coefficient .",
    "all lam s equations obtained above have only two free parameters , @xmath85 and @xmath112 .",
    "these two free parameters control frequency and amplitude of pion oscillations and consequently by equation ( [ xx ] ) also the rate of particle production of the photon field .",
    "energy density for each lam s equation can be calculated by @xcite    @xmath198    we are not taking into account here the back reaction of the particles produced .    in order to obtain a more realistic physical description",
    "is necessary introduce by hand a term , in ( [ 1 ] ) or , yet in ( [ 21 ] ) , that represents the back reaction of particles produced .",
    "since this work aims just to propose a new process of photoproduction in ns , it is sufficient to prove that the pr phenomenon could exist in the ns medium , as it is shown above .      using the gauge transformation ( [ 19 ] ) with the lorentz condition , equation ( [ 17 ] ) can be written as    @xmath199    now we take as zeroth approximation the nucleons contribution as a constant in space and time variables .",
    "this is , of course , a crude approximation relied on isotropy , homogeneity and independence on time for the nucleon matter inside the star core .",
    "nevertheless the figures [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] shows that periodicity of the pion fields is robust against extreme variations of the nucleons contributions ( in zeroth order ) . that is , the nucleons have only a weak influence on the pion evolution , whereas the strong influence on amplitude and frequency comes from the value and signal of pion mass term @xmath85 . in adition",
    "we believe that so restrict conditions of constance of nucleons contribution can be relaxed and the periodicity of pion fields will not strongly affected .",
    "this is enough in order to pr mechanism works well .",
    "therefore , for our qualitative approach we can neglect the nucleon contribution .",
    "taking the fourier transform , for the approximation described above , we obtain the same lam equation ( 24 ) .",
    "all numerical solutions suggest that equation ( 24 ) possess resonant bands , that is , the pr phenomenon may occurs even in the presence of nucleons . clearly ,",
    "since @xmath200 has exponential behavior , so @xmath201 in ( [ x6 ] ) .",
    "we had showed that parametric resonance phenomenon , under certain conditions , may occur inside of a ns modifying briefly its thermal evolution .",
    "it is worth to mention that our approach can be implemented , not only for the harrington and shepard s model , but in fact for any ns model which presents superconductor phase with periodic motions ( eom ) and a suitable coupling to electromagnetic field to furnish a hill s equation .",
    "pr mechanism can be effective enough to produce a huge number of photons , out of equilibrium with the surrounding matter , which must diffuse out from the ns . in this case , clearly , a subsequent reheating of the ns interior must occur , much the same as in the inflationary theory , but in a far smaller energy scale . from the mathemartical point of view",
    "we have two cases to consider , namely , for real floquet exponent and when it is an imaginary number .",
    "both cases lead to an enhancing of the ns brightness , but the possible observable effects are expected to be very different as detailed below .",
    "taking for granted the current theories of ns interiors as nearly correct , in our opinion , this kind of pr phenomenon can , in principle , be detected by observation of anomalous enhancing of the ns brightness .",
    "the intensity , as well the lapse of time of this higher brightness depends on the details of diffusion of the produced photons to reach the surface of the star .",
    "this is a difficult problem since , by its turn , it depends on the model of the ns matter structure . on the other hand ,",
    "recent works seem to indicate a nearly black body surface radiation from neutron stars whose details also depends on the model of their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "if this is correct , in the case that pr mechanism is active , it leads to some interesting results on the radiation released by a ns .",
    "we consider first the case of real floquet exponent . on a blackbody spectrum background",
    ", pr manifests its presence , by the theory outlined above , in a weak regime , as a perturbation on ns spectrum with superimposed bumps on the equally spaced frequencies due to the periodic pattern of the floquet exponent as a function of the momentum @xmath164 , as is clearly seen in equation ( [ 23 ] ) and in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "this periodicity implies that high energy photons are also produced and their spectral lines should dominate over the blackbody ones , which lead us to expect that pr effects could be better measured on the tails of a blackbody spectrum .",
    "furthermore , although in a qualitative ground , in the case of a very strong regime ( with a large real floquet exponent ) of photon production , the external star layers can not resist against the enormous pressure due to the reheating of matter in the star core by high energy photons . in this case",
    "the star ejects its upper layers with a huge burst of energy releasing . in this way",
    "our model suggest a feasible and simple explanation for the recent observations of neutron stars giant flares @xcite .",
    "shortly , pr mechanism with a real and large floquet exponent is better to explain non - periodic , but giant flares from ns . on the other hand , if the floquet exponent is imaginary , eq .",
    "( 27 ) shows that the number density of produced particles is a periodic function in time and so we can expect a periodic pertubation on the brightness of the ns while the pr regime is active .",
    "this is quite interesting since giant periodic flares from repeaters have been observed in the past few years .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "however , for this case , we can have only an incomplete view since for giant flares the unkown coefficient in eq.(27 ) must be very large , since the time factor is a trigonometrical function and so a bounded function .",
    "so , a further study is needed to solve this quest .",
    "firstly , it must be stressed that parametric resonance in ns can be a rare phenomenon , due to the special conditions of the superconductor matter and its coupling with the electromagnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , in the weak pr regime , as mentioned above , it is worth to notice that , in principle , it is possible to measure an uprising regular ( equally spaced frequencies ) brightness variation on the nearly blackbody spectra , perhaps better measured on their tails , of those neutron stars close enough to us . in adition ,",
    "in the strong pr regime , the model offers also a simple explanation for some reported rare giant flares coming from these compact objects . on the other hand",
    "the signal can also presents a time periodic pattern . in this case , as in inflationary theory , it is not expected an explosive behaviour of the star , but only periodic flares with low intensity",
    ".    finally , more importantly perhaps , we are inclined to think that parametric resonance is a phenomenon active not only in inflationary cosmology but in several much smaller coupled physical systems with extreme conditions of pressure and temperature in our universe .",
