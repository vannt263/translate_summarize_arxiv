    "plasma turbulence has been analyzed extensively using in - situ measurements of magnetic field and velocity fluctuations in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of these fluctuations are usually interpreted by means of power spectral density @xmath10 as a function of frequency in spacecraft frame .",
    "power spectral densities ( psd ) derived from these in - situ measurements of single spacecraft are generally obtained in a one - dimensional reduced form .",
    "this means that fluctuations associated with various wave vectors are observed at the same frequency in spacecraft frame and thus contribute to the spectral density @xmath10 at a certain frequency @xmath11 .",
    "however , turbulence models are commonly formulated in three - dimensional wave vector space , where each wave vector @xmath0 is assigned a certain energy . under the assumption of taylor s hypothesis and statistical homogeneity",
    ", the observable power spectrum @xmath10 can be obtained from the energy distribution in @xmath0-space by a two - dimensional integration .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is currently no application , where several plasma scales in @xmath0-space have been considered simultaneously .",
    "we provide here a numerical tool , which we use to study the effects of various @xmath0-space distributions .-",
    "space distributions by the interested reader . ]",
    "note , that for the calculation of reduced power spectral densities in frequency space , the applicability of taylor s hypothesis and homogeneity needs to be justified for each physical system under investigation , e.g. , the solar wind or magnetospheric plasmas .",
    "we will return to this issue when we compare observations in the solar wind and saturn s magnetosphere with our model results .",
    "the transformation from @xmath0-space to the observed frequency space taken in a rest frame moving with respect to the turbulent media is unique .",
    "in contrast , the observations taken in the moving frame do not allow to uniquely determine the spatio - temporal turbulent structure in the rest frame of the media ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus interpretation of observed single spacecraft frequency spectra can only test whether certain @xmath0-space distributions of turbulence are consistent with observations or not , but they can not uniquely identify one certain @xmath0-space structure .",
    "the statistical properties of turbulent fluctuations have led to the understanding that turbulent fluctuations in plasmas are anisotropic with respect to a background magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite observed anisotropy with a composite slab and 2-d model consisting of wave vectors parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field , respectively . @xcite",
    "successfully explained the relative ratios of turbulence power in different magnetic field components of helios measurements with a 85% 2-d and 15% slab model .",
    "@xcite found that low frequency turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind could be explained with a combination of 2-d and a radial slab model . to explain the anisotropic cascading process ,",
    "@xcite proposed a critical balance between alfvn wave period and nonlinear time , which leads to spectral anisotropy of the measured power spectral densities .",
    "although there have been recent results that seem to confirm the critical balance theory @xcite , it is an ongoing debate if critical balance is an inherent property of plasma turbulence .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , found no dependence of the spectral index on the field - to - flow angle @xmath4 , i.e. , the angle between @xmath12 and plasma flow @xmath13 ( relative to the observing spacecraft ) , using a global background magnetic field in their analysis and @xcite recently found a @xmath4-independent range , which they claim contradicts the critical balance assumption .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze in detail the spectral form of one - dimensional reduced psd based on critical balance in the mhd and kinetic range of scales .",
    "the psd are modeled for the first time for oblique angles @xmath14 from mhd to electron scales based on a three - dimensional energy distribution . in section [ sec : de ] , we discuss the diagonal elements of the spectral tensor , which depend on two scalar functions for toroidal and poloidal fluctuations and we show how the tensor reduces to a one - dimensional spectrum if taylor s hypothesis holds . in section [ sec : models ] , we introduce our model for the energy distribution in @xmath0-space based on a critically balanced cascade on mhd , ion kinetic , and electron kinetic scales .",
    "further , we discuss potential anisotropic damping terms . in a comparative study in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , we analyze if the results published by @xcite in the mhd regime and @xcite in the kinetic regime of the solar wind can be explained by a critically balanced or slab/2-d model .",
    "in addition to @xcite , who made a similar analysis for the results of @xcite , we include kinetic scalings and damping effects . in section [ sec : satmod ] , we investigate how spectra observed by @xcite in saturn s magnetosphere are consistent with a critically balanced cascade and damping processes .",
    "we like to point out that our analysis is also relevant to modeling cosmic ray transport in turbulent media ( e.g. , jokipii , 1966 ; engelbrecht & burger , 2014 , 2015 ) . cosmic rays are traveling with very large velocities through turbulent plasma fields while being scattered by time - variable fields , which are seen in a lagrangian frame by the moving particles commonly described in an appropriate guiding center .",
    "thus , cosmic rays are subject to the same sampling effects of anisotropic wave vector distribution as the time - dependent spacecraft measurements commonly also taken at large velocities with respect to the turbulent plasma .",
    "the effect of field - to - flow angle on cosmic ray properties has for example been studied by @xcite .",
    "as we are primarily interested in the power spectra of the fluctuations , we will only discuss the diagonal elements of the spectral tensor . under the assumption of incompressible axisymmetric and mirror symmetric turbulence with regards to the mean magnetic field , a general form of the correlation tensor",
    "can be derived @xcite .",
    "mirror symmetry leads to vanishing helicity @xcite and is therefore equivalent to balanced turbulence , i.e. , the same amount of energy in waves parallel and anti - parallel to the background magnetic field ( for the imbalanced case , see * ? ? ?",
    "the diagonal elements of the spectral tensor then depend on only two independent scalar functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which describe the toroidal ( shear - alfvn mode on mhd scales ) and poloidal fluctuations ( pseudo alfvn mode ) , respectively .",
    "the latter are the incompressible limit of the slow mode @xcite .    in a magnetic",
    "field - aligned coordinate system with @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 arbitrarily oriented perpendicular unit vectors perpendicular to @xmath20 , the diagonal elements can be written as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the trace of the tensor is @xmath24 .",
    "because the general form of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is not known , we need to introduce reasonable estimates for the scalar functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 . according to @xcite ,",
    "slow mode waves are passively cascaded by alfvn waves , which means that the same scaling can be expected for the poloidal fluctuations @xmath16 . due to the fact that @xmath25 , which is commonly observed in plasma turbulence @xcite , we may estimate the proportionality between the two functions from the measured power anisotropy @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the perpendicular and @xmath28 the parallel component of the one - dimensional reduced spectrum .",
    "observations in the solar wind indicate that usually @xmath29 @xcite , which means the error stemming from the assumption of passively cascading poloidal fluctuations should be rather small for the one - dimensional reduced spectra @xmath30 . however , we note that the influence of poloidal fluctuations increases in the kinetic range and that recent findings indicate a slightly different scaling of the poloidal fluctuations @xcite",
    ".    as we are able to estimate the scalar function @xmath16 according to equation  ( [ eq : tp ] ) , we can now proceed to describe the diagonal elements of the spectral tensor with a single scalar function @xmath15 .",
    "this function depends on the three - dimensional wave vector @xmath0 but since we assume axisymmetry along the mean magnetic field , this dependence further reduces to @xmath31 .",
    "each wave vector represents a fluctuation with a certain wavelength along a certain direction in space .",
    "these fluctuations have a constant angle to the mean magnetic field , i.e. , global and local mean magnetic field are identical in our model . for magnetic power",
    "spectral densities , the scalar function @xmath15 is in units of nt@xmath32m@xmath33 .      in order to compare modeled energy densities in three - dimensional @xmath0-space ( e.g. , equation  ( [ eq : emhd ] ) ) with measured psd",
    ", we need to calculate the reduced one - dimensional spectrum in frequency space @xmath10 from the spectral tensor given in equations ( [ eq : sxx])-([eq : szz ] ) . as the modeled spectra",
    "are calculated with the assumption of statistically homogeneous fields and taylor s hypothesis , the measured data , which the modeled spectra will be compared with , need to be statistically stationary . when our model is compared to observations ,",
    "therefore both assumptions , i.e. , statistical stationarity and taylor s hypothesis need to be verified for the particular properties of the turbulent system and the relative velocity of the moving rest frame with respect to the plasma under investigation .",
    "for the application of taylor s hypothesis , it is required that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the frequency of structures or fluctuations being convected over the spacecraft with velocity @xmath13 and @xmath36 is the frequency of the corresponding wave or fluctuation in the plasma frame .",
    "time - stationarity of observed turbulent fields is often checked for with stationarity tests ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "approximately , it can also be estimated with visual inspection of wavelet scalograms .    in the solar wind , where most of our subsequent analysis is applied to , taylor s hypothesis is well satisfied in the inertial range @xcite .",
    "however , when the mach number drops below unity , e.g. , close to the sun or in planetary magnetospheres , taylor s hypothesis might not be valid anymore , in general .",
    "violation of taylor s hypothesis may also happen at kinetic scales , where phase speeds of kinetic alfvn waves ( kaw ) and whistler waves can become comparable to the relative plasma velocity @xmath37 and frequencies @xmath36 in the plasma frame strongly increase .",
    "however , strong anisotropy of the fluctuations , e.g. , @xmath25 , may help to satisfy taylor s hypothesis : for kaw , the phase velocity is strongly reduced for nearly perpendicular propagation as @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , taylor s hypothesis holds in the solar wind for a critically balanced kaw cascade even in the dissipation range @xcite .",
    "the same reasoning applies to strongly anisotropic kaw fluctuations in the magnetospheres of jupiter and saturn @xcite .",
    "our model is also applicable for non - relativistic cosmic rays . here , typical energies of @xmath39mev correspond to @xmath40m@xmath41s@xmath42 , for which taylor s hypothesis is clearly satisfied .",
    "whistler wave turbulence on the other hand violates taylor s hypothesis and can therefore not be described by our model .",
    "if taylor s hypothesis and homogeneity apply , the diagonal elements of the reduced spectral tensor in frequency space , @xmath43 , can be obtained by integrating the three - dimensional energy densities @xmath44 over a plane perpendicular to the flow direction @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath45 here , we assumed that the @xmath46-axis is parallel to the background magnetic field ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 , so that @xmath18 lies in the plane spanned by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which is sometimes called the quasi - parallel direction @xcite .    in order to evaluate equation  ( [ eq : trafo ] ) numerically",

    "if we rotate the coordinate system by the angle @xmath49 about the @xmath50-axis such that @xmath51 then @xmath52 will be aligned with @xmath13 and the plane of integration lies in the @xmath53 plane .",

    "note , that several different wave vectors map to the same frequency in spacecraft frame .",
    "in fact , the power spectral density @xmath43 is determined by integration over a plane with normal vector @xmath58 . for the numerical evaluation ,",
    "the scalar functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are inserted in equation  ( [ eq : pfull ] ) using equations ( [ eq : sxx])-([eq : szz ] ) in the rotated form . with this , we are able to calculate the power spectral densities @xmath43 in spacecraft frame .",
    "in this section , we introduce a @xmath0-space turbulence model ranging from mhd to electron scales based on commonly discussed models in the literature . with this model",
    "we calculate one - dimensional reduced psd for arbitrary measurement geometries .",
    "we focus on the theory of a strong critically balanced turbulent cascade as originally proposed by @xcite for alfvnic turbulence .",
    "it has been further developed to include the ion kinetic range @xcite and the electron kinetic range @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that it is suited to describe solar wind turbulence @xcite , although these observations have not been explicitly compared with reduced spectra rigorously derived from three - dimensional @xmath0-space models .",
    "however , with the forward model derived here , we are able to perform such an explicit test and are able to check if the observations are truly in agreement with critical balance and other suggested properties of three - dimensional @xmath0-space .      according to @xcite ,",
    "the ( kinetic ) energy distribution on mhd scales can be described as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the alfvn speed with @xmath63 the mass density of the plasma , @xmath6 the outer scale , and `` _ _ @xmath64 is a positive , symmetric function of @xmath65 , that becomes negligibly small , when @xmath66 _ _ '' @xcite .",

    "this relation leads to spectral anisotropy , i.e. , different scalings depending on the field - to - flow angle @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite find that the function that best explains the magnetic fluctuations in their simulation of incompressible mhd turbulence , is @xmath69 according to equation  ( [ eq : gs95 ] ) , this indicates that the magnetic fluctuations on the outer scale @xmath6 are strong , @xmath70 .",
    "however , @xcite find from fits to solar wind data that @xmath71 overestimates the energy of the turbulent fluctuations by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the energy level of the modeled power spectra can not be obtained unambiguously .",
    "the energy distribution given by equation  ( [ eq : emhd ] ) describes the alfvnic fluctuations and we thus set @xmath73 on mhd scales . according to equation  ( [ eq : tp ] ) , this constrains the poloidal function to @xmath74 .",
    "next to the exponential function used in equation  ( [ eq : emhd ] ) , there are several different possibilities to describe @xmath64 , e.g. , dirac delta , heaviside or gauss functions . the particular choice of @xmath64 , however , results in similar spectral anisotropies as found in the case of mhd scales by @xcite and @xcite . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the one - dimensional psd scales as @xmath76 and for @xmath77 as @xmath78 in the inertial range .",
    "exact power - laws in frequency space only occur for these two extreme cases .",
    "in the literature , however , it is often implicitly assumed that the spectra in the intermediate range @xmath79 also follow power - laws with spectral slopes @xmath80 and that the spectral index @xmath3 of the reduced spectra is  similar to the spectral index of three - dimensional @xmath0-space  independent of frequency . in this paper",
    ", we will see that these assumptions are incorrect .",
    "when the observed doppler - shifted frequencies reach scales close to the characteristic ion scales , such as the ion gyro radius @xmath81 or the ion inertial length @xmath82 , the mhd approximation breaks down and one needs to take into account kinetic effects to describe the plasma dynamics . for the remainder of this paper , we use the gyro radius as the controlling kinetic scale with an associated critical balance on ion kinetic scales @xmath83 according to @xcite . here , we drop the factor @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the ion plasma beta and @xmath86 and @xmath87 the temperatures of ions and electrons , respectively , because the factor is of order unity in the solar wind and saturn s magnetosphere .",
    "note , that our forward model can similarly be formulated for other theories or with the inertial length as the controlling scale .",
    "we model the transition from mhd to kinetic scales as an abrupt change in the function @xmath88 at @xmath89 without energy loss , e.g. , due to ion resonances .",

    "both energy distributions are equal , @xmath94 . also , the kinetic energy distribution , @xmath92 , is assumed to scale as @xmath95 for @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "these requirements are fulfilled in the expression @xmath96 for the parallel cascade ( @xmath77 ) , this leads to a scaling of @xmath97 .    at even smaller scales ,",
    "we approach the electron gyro radius @xmath98 and the energy distribution changes once again from @xmath92 to an electron or dissipation range distribution @xmath99 . here , landau damping is assumed to weaken the cascade so that there is no more parallel transfer of energy @xcite .",

    "the energy distribution in @xmath0-space according to our model is shown in figure [ fig : kspa ] for the parameters given in table [ tab : sw ] .",
    "it shows logarithmically equidistant iso - contours of energy densities according to equations ( [ eq : emhd ] ) , ( [ eq : ekaw ] ) and ( [ eq : ed ] ) in a double - logarithmic plot as a function of @xmath105 and @xmath106 normalized by the ion gyro radius @xmath81 . the characteristic slopes of the critical balance relations , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 in the mhd , kaw , and ed regime , respectively , can be seen as the boundary , where the energy becomes negligible ( dark blue ) .",
    "note , that the energy density decreases with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which leads to a seemingly negative slope in the electron dissipation range .",

    ", these dashed lines would be horizontal and parallel to the @xmath105-axis , and for @xmath75 , they would be vertical and parallel to the @xmath106-axis . however , due to the double - logarithmic nature of the plot , the dashed lines for intermediate angles @xmath4 are curved .",
    "note , that even for a very small angle @xmath114 , the plane of integration turns quasi - perpendicular to the @xmath105-axis , i.e. , lies parallel to planes expected from integration for @xmath116 , for sufficiently large @xmath105 .      while equation  ( [ eq : pfull ] ) can be integrated analytically for angles @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath75 , it can only be numerically evaluated for intermediate angles @xmath79 . here",
    ", we carry out this numerical integration for the first time considering all scales from the mhd to the electron kinetic regime .",
    "results of this calculation using the parameters given in table [ tab : sw ] are shown in figure [ fig : psd_theta ] .",
    "we plot the resulting psd for several field - to - flow angles as a function of frequency @xmath11 in spacecraft frame .",
    "note , that frequency can be transformed into normalized wave number according to @xmath117 , particularly for parameters in table [ tab : sw ] : @xmath118 .",
    "for @xmath75 the spectral breaks of the psd , which mark the transition from mhd to kaw and kaw to ed range , are located at the doppler - shifted frequencies corresponding to @xmath81 and @xmath98 ( denoted by vertical dashed lines ) . here",
    ", the spectral slope of the reduced psd steepens from @xmath119 to @xmath120 and from @xmath120 to @xmath121 , respectively . for smaller angles @xmath122 these spectral breaks are less pronounced and occur at lower frequencies .",
    "the expected spectral slopes for @xmath77 and @xmath75 are shown as black lines in figure [ fig : psd_theta ] to guide the eye . here and",
    "throughout this paper , we use plasma parameters characteristic of the solar wind at @xmath123au as given in table [ tab : sw ] , which we adopt from the work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "l c parameter & value + background magnetic field @xmath124 & @xmath125nt + outer scale @xmath6 & @xmath126 km + plasma speed @xmath37 & @xmath127km@xmath41s@xmath42 + alfvn speed @xmath128 & @xmath129km@xmath41s@xmath42 + ion gyro radius @xmath81 & @xmath130 km + electron gyro radius @xmath98 & @xmath131 km +    we note a particular interesting feature in figure [ fig : psd_theta ] : the spectra for oblique angles are steepened in a short frequency range around the first spectral break at @xmath132 and then flatten out toward a slope of @xmath120 at higher frequencies . the smaller the angle @xmath4 , the longer the range , where psd are steeper than @xmath120 . such an asymptotic behavior has been predicted for the mhd range by @xcite , however , without specifying the frequency range , where this transition could be expected . here , we show for the first time that this transition happens on a short frequency range around the spectral break in the solar wind .",
    "we emphasize the importance of this result as it contradicts the commonly assumed constancy of the spectral index with frequency .",
    "also , it implies that psd in the kinetic range are almost exclusively observed with their perpendicular slope ( here @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) if not subject to damping . in the remainder of this section , we explain this feature as a geometrical or sampling effect .",
    "the flattening of the psd , although puzzling at first , can be explained with the anisotropic distribution of energy in @xmath0-space . because of the linear relation between @xmath105 and @xmath106 in equation  ( [ eq : plane ] )",
    ", the point of maximum curvature of the integration plane in figure  [ fig : kspa ] grows faster than the critical balance relations @xmath1 in the mhd ( @xmath133 ) , kaw ( @xmath134 ) , and ed ( @xmath135 ) range .",
    "hence , for increasing frequencies @xmath11 , the plane of integration given by equation  ( [ eq : plane ] ) effectively has only contributions from the part quasi - perpendicular to the @xmath105-axis in the double - logarithmic plot of figure [ fig : kspa ] .",
    "therefore , at frequencies above a transition frequency @xmath136 , the power spectrum at a given field - to - flow angle @xmath4 will have a slope within a small error @xmath137 to that at @xmath75 appropriate to mhd ( @xmath119 ) , kaw ( @xmath120 ) , or ed ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the transition frequency @xmath136 thus marks the boundary , where the anisotropy of the @xmath0-space energy distribution becomes so large that it is indistinguishable from a 2d - distribution in the reduced psd within measurement error @xmath137 .",
    "it is this feature that causes the spectral slope of the psd to asymptotically approach its perpendicular value at high frequencies .",
    "a derivation of an analytically approximated expression @xmath138 ( see equation  ( [ eq : fmax ] ) ) can be found in appendix [ app ] .",
    "the frequencies , where the psd turn quasi - perpendicular , are shown in figure [ fig : psd_theta ] as colored dots assuming a pure kaw cascade .",
    "note , that the transition frequency @xmath138 , in contrast to the spectral break , shifts to higher frequencies for smaller angles @xmath4 . assuming a plain mhd cascade , the approximate transition frequency from equation  ( [ eq : fmax ] ) gives @xmath139hz . the corresponding transition frequencies for @xmath140 $ ] reach into the kinetic range of scales .",
    "the transition to quasi - perpendicular scaling is always found at frequencies below the electron spectral break , @xmath141 , which is why frequencies @xmath138 are not shown in the ed range .",
    "we find that the transition for kaw toward a quasi - perpendicular cascade for almost all field - to - flow angles ( namely @xmath142 , see figure [ fig : fmax ] in the appendix ) occurs already below @xmath123hz , where the spectral break is observed at typical solar wind conditions @xcite .",
    "we conclude that spectra of a critically balanced kaw cascade without damping on kinetic scales will almost exclusively be observed with spectral indices close to @xmath120 and @xmath121 in the ion and electron kinetic range , respectively . only for small angles and in a short frequency range between the first spectral break and @xmath123hz a measurably steeper slope",
    "might be observed in the solar wind .",
    "we stress the importance of this result : we have shown that the spectral index in a critically balanced cascade for oblique field - to - flow angles @xmath79 is not constant with growing frequency .",
    "instead , it evolves toward a quasi - perpendicular slope as a function of frequency .",
    "therefore , we can not expect to observe significantly steeper slopes than @xmath120 and @xmath121 over a broad frequency range in the kaw and ed range , respectively , for a critically balanced cascade in the solar wind .",
    "indeed , we see in section  [ sec : damp ] that such slopes only appear if the fluctuations are additionally subject to damping . this transition of reduced psd toward quasi - perpendicular spectra contrasts a common understanding in the literature , where it is often implicitly assumed that the psd have a power - law shape with a constant spectral index that only depends on the field - to - flow angle .",
    "it is interesting to note that a three - dimensional direct numerical simulation with strong guide field by @xcite produced a qualitatively similar transition toward a perpendicular cascade with a @xmath4-independent slope , although the flattening of their spectra does not follow equation  ( [ eq : fmax ] ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the dissipation of fluctuations on small scales , e.g. , ion - cyclotron damping , landau damping and current sheet formation @xcite .",
    "most of the proposed mechanisms are anisotropic with regards to the background magnetic field . in this section ,",
    "we analyze how possible anisotropic damping terms that act on the energy distribution in three - dimensional @xmath0-space change the characteristics of reduced one - dimensional spectra . here",
    ", we assume that damping leads to an exponential decay of the energy in @xmath0-space associated with the damped wave vectors .    from our assumption of critical balance",
    ", it follows that @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , damping at a fixed scale affects the turbulent cascade first through perpendicular wave vectors and only later through wave vectors parallel to the mean magnetic field .",
    "it has been argued that the ion - cyclotron resonance at @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the ion - cyclotron frequency , has only minor influence on a critically balanced cascade as it is reached only at very high perpendicular wave numbers @xmath111 , where landau damping already dominates @xcite . with our synthetic spectra",
    ", we are now able to test this argument quantitatively .      for the ion - cyclotron resonance ,",
    "the damping rate is low for @xmath146 and increases rapidly as @xmath147 approaches unity @xcite .",
    "we may therefore model the ion - cyclotron resonance as an exponential decay according to @xmath148 to quantify the effective damping , we model damped spectra @xmath149 using the parameters in table [ tab : sw ] and find only minor changes compared to their undamped counterparts @xmath150 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : icr_diff ] , we show the ratio @xmath151 as a function of normalized wave number for several angles @xmath4 . both @xmath150 and @xmath149",
    "cover all three ranges from mhd to kaw to electron kinetic scales . for quasi - parallel spectra ( @xmath114 ) , a peak factor of @xmath152",
    "is observed around the spectral break .",
    "power spectra @xmath149 for larger field - to - flow angles @xmath153 only differ a factor of @xmath154 from psd without damping . on electron scales ,",
    "the difference between damped and undamped spectra remains constant as there is no more parallel transfer along the cascade .",
    "the asymptotic factor @xmath151 for @xmath155 and @xmath75 can be calculated by integration of equation  ( [ eq : ed ] ) over @xmath106 according to @xmath156 this shows that the influence of cyclotron damping on the spectral shape can be neglected in the solar wind for critically balanced turbulence .",
    "however , one might think of systems , in which the ion - cyclotron resonance _ does _ change the form of the psd significantly .",
    "such systems could be characterized by ( 1 ) low plasma density , which leads to large alfvn speeds ; ( 2 ) a critical balance exponent @xmath7 close to unity ; and/or ( 3 ) a much smaller outer scale than the @xmath157 m found in the solar wind @xcite , so that high @xmath110 values are reached earlier in the cascade .",
    "an enhanced ion - cyclotron damping then leads to a visible decrease of spectral power around the spectral break .",

    "consequently , the effect of the exponential damping term is stronger when applied to three - dimensional @xmath0-space compared to a reduced one - dimensional spectrum .",

    "we proceed to estimate the frequency for which the reduced psd turns quasi - perpendicular by demanding that the ratio @xmath291 be almost unity . because the spectral index is obtained from the logarithms of the power spectral energy , we demand @xmath292 < \\epsilon \\label{eq : eps } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath293 is chosen according to typical measurement uncertainties @xmath137 for spectral slopes in solar wind observations .",
    "to proceed further , we approximate @xmath294 the geometrical interpretation of this approximation is shown in figure [ fig : kp12 ] . instead of the exact solutions shown by the red circles , we now evaluate the integral at the approximated locations shown by the blue circles .",
    "these are slightly shifted along the integration curve toward lower @xmath111-values .",
    "now , we can write equation  ( [ eq : kp12 ] ) as @xmath295 inserting this in equation  ( [ eq : eps ] ) , we get @xmath296 if we expand the two terms on the left - hand - side of equation  ( [ eq : eps2 ] ) to second order around @xmath297 , we find that @xmath298 inserting @xmath299 and @xmath300 into this equation finally yields @xmath301    for an appropriately chosen @xmath302 , the difference between energies @xmath277 and @xmath290 for all frequencies @xmath303 is so small that the scaling will be quasi - perpendicular within measurement errors @xmath137 .",
    "note , that the change of slope in frequency space is a pure sampling effect and does not mean that the nature of the turbulent cascade in wave vector space is changing at this frequency . for @xmath304",
    ", we can further simplify equation  ( [ eq : fmax2 ] ) to determine the approximate transition frequency that marks the boundary to quasi - perpendicular scaling as @xmath305 note , that equation ( [ eq : fmax ] ) can additionally be used to test whether an observed steep slope in a reduced spectrum of critically balanced turbulence can be explained by spectral anisotropy only , i.e. , without damping , or if additional damping is needed to explain the steep slope .    in order to check",
    "in which turbulent range @xmath138 lies , i.e. , in the mhd , the kaw or the ed range , the following procedure might be used : one chooses the appropriate critical balance exponent for the observed range of scales , namely @xmath133 for mhd , @xmath134 for kaw , or @xmath135 for electron kinetic scales . inserting @xmath7 in equation ( [ eq : fmax ] ) together with the relative plasma velocity @xmath37 , observation angle @xmath4 , outer scale @xmath6 , and controlling kinetic scale @xmath274 ( @xmath275 for kaw and @xmath276 for ed ) , one obtains the transition frequency @xmath138 for the observation geometry under consideration .",
    "all frequencies @xmath303 will be characterized by a quasi - perpendicular spectrum .    to estimate in which range ( mhd , kaw , ed ) the transition toward quasi - perpendicular",
    "spectra occurs , one can calculate the corresponding perpendicular wave number according to @xmath306 .",
    "if the resultant @xmath111 falls outside the range used to calculate @xmath138 ( with certain @xmath7 and @xmath274 ) , then the transition toward quasi - perpendicular spectra will either happen on smaller scales ( if @xmath111 is too large for the corresponding range ) or the transition has already happened on larger scales ( if @xmath111 is too small ) .",
    "the latter case , e.g. , is found for the ed range in the solar wind as the transition toward quasi - perpendicular spectra already occurs on kaw scales . to find the correct transition frequency ,",
    "the procedure then needs to be repeated with the @xmath7 and @xmath274 values from the alternative range .",
    "note , that the error parameter @xmath302 must be determined according to the measurement accuracy , which usually requires modeling the corresponding spectra .",
    "we find that @xmath307 in equation  ( [ eq : fmax ] ) represents an uncertainty of the spectral index of @xmath308 in the kaw and @xmath309 in the mhd range for typical solar wind conditions .",
    "for the kaw range , this uncertainty is on the order of the measurement error in solar wind observations .    in the following , we test the approximate expression @xmath138 given in equation  ( [ eq : fmax ] ) against our three - dimensional model results . for that matter",
    ", we determine the transition frequencies @xmath310 from modeled psd without a break at @xmath311 or @xmath141 , i.e. , for equations ( [ eq : emhd ] ) and ( [ eq : ekaw ] ) separately , each extending over the whole range of wave vectors . because of divergence at low wave number @xmath111 ,",
    "this method is numerically not stable if we use an energy distribution in @xmath0-space , which is solely given by equation  ( [ eq : ed ] ) . from the modeled psd in the mhd and kaw range ,",
    "we calculate the spectral slopes between two consecutive data points ( @xmath312 ) as @xmath267 , where @xmath313 $ ] in the mhd and kaw regime , respectively .",
    "we then define @xmath310 as the frequency , where @xmath137 decreases below thresholds of @xmath308 in the kaw and @xmath309 in the mhd range .    in figure",

    "the modeled three - dimensional results agree well with the estimations from equation  ( [ eq : fmax ] ) for @xmath307 , which are shown by solid lines for the mhd , kaw , and ed range .",
    "on mhd scales , the transition toward quasi - perpendicular spectra occurs over a broad frequency range and is therefore not as apparent as on kinetic scales .",
    "the calculated transition frequencies @xmath138 are shown in the corresponding figures throughout this paper as colored dots for the kaw range .",
    "the transition frequencies @xmath315 for the mhd regime according to equation  ( [ eq : fmax ] ) are not shown in the figures as they usually fall outside the mhd range , i.e. , @xmath316 . however , for @xmath317 equation  ( [ eq : fmax ] ) results in @xmath318hz .",
