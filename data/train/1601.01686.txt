    "the dust content in galaxies is intimately linked to their evolutionary history",
    ". nevertheless , the mass of the dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and its ratio with the gas mass ( dust - to - gas ratio , dgr ) , are critical parameters for establishing the evolutionary state of a galaxy .",
    "however , the complex interplay between dust destruction and dust formation mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , makes it difficult to infer evolutionary trends from dust alone .",
    "another signature of evolutionary status is a galaxy s metal abundance , generally quantified by the nebular abundance of oxygen , o / h . although dust grains consist mainly of metals , grains are not the dominant contributor to the metal budget of galaxies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the metals in dust and the metals in gas are expected to be coupled through the ism energy cycle , and much work has been focused on comparing dust content with metallicity . indeed , the dgr and o / h seem to be fairly well correlated both in the milky way and in nearby star - forming galaxies .",
    "observations of the dgr compared with the gas - phase metallicity suggest approximate linearity between the two ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the seminal work by @xcite , many galaxy evolution models and models of the ism now _ assume _ that dust content is proportional to metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "both izw18  and sbs0335@xmath2052  are embedded in vast hi  envelopes which include other galaxies or galaxy components .",
    "sbs0335@xmath2052  has a western component sbs0335@xmath2052w at a distance of @xmath022kpc within a 64kpc hi  cloud @xcite ; izw18  ( main body ) lies about 2kpc away from the `` c '' component , or zwicky s flare , within a diffuse hi  cloud extending over @xmath019kpc @xcite .",

    "the large beams with which hi  is typically observed exacerbate the problem , both because of beam dilution which causes hi  surface density to be underestimated , but also because the tiny dimensions of the galaxies compared with their hi  envelope make it difficult to assess the hi  content of the galaxy itself .",

    "hence , we have attempted to determine the mass of the ionized component in the two galaxies .",
    "radio continuum observations of the free - free emission of ionized gas give emission measures , and thus mean densities and source size . the radio spectrum for izw18",

    "we have done this by comparing the source size inferred from the radio emission measure to the optical size ( see sect . [",

    "this could be a consequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the optically thick gas in this galaxy as indicated by the radio spectrum , so for sbs0335@xmath2052  we have used conservatively a filling factor of @xmath13 , roughly the lowest value found by @xcite . with these densities and filling factors , and the optical size of the galaxy as for hi , we estimate ionized gas masses of @xmath14@xmath9  and @xmath15@xmath9  for izw18  and sbs0335@xmath2052 , respectively .",
    "the mass of the ionized gas is comparable to that of the atomic gas in both galaxies .",
    "if , instead of the radio - determined value of 3200@xmath11 , we consider the ionized gas density of 500@xmath11  for sbs0335@xmath2052  inferred from the optical [ s ii ] lines @xcite , and a larger filling factor of @xmath16 , we would estimate an ionized gas density of @xmath17@xmath9 , 50% of our former estimate .",
    "this can be considered as a rough measure of the uncertainty inherent in this calculation .",
    "co emission has never been detected in either galaxy ; thus it is difficult to measure h@xmath3  masses , independently of the unknown co luminosity - to - h@xmath3  mass conversion factor @xmath18 .",

    "these masses are highly uncertain , and assume that sfr surface density at low metallicity follows the same scaling relations as more metal - enriched galaxies .",
    "dust masses for sbs0335@xmath2052  and izw18  were measured by h14 by fitting the optical - to - mm spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with spherical _ dusty _  models @xcite .",

    "h14 discussed differences relative to @xcite for sbs0335@xmath2052  and @xcite for izw18 ; here we compare our measurements to more recent work although we are unable to compare our dust - mass estimates with @xcite because there is no tabulation of their dust masses .",
    "@xcite use a multiple - temperature modified blackbody ( mbb ) approach , and fix the emissivity index for all components .",
    "however , they only discuss the warm and cold dust ( not the hot ) because , as they note , the hot dust ( for @xmath22 m ) is not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "considering their two - component fits , the seds shown in their fig .",
    "6 almost never pass through the longer wavelength points .",
    "this is a consequence of the assumption of single - temperature mbbs , and is expected to bias dust - mass estimates toward lower masses .",
    "although seemingly a small deviation , the constraints offered by longer wavelengths significantly raise dust mass estimates , especially at low metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is well known that including short wavelengths in a single - temperature mbb fit gives unrealistically low dust masses because the mean temperature of the dust radiating at these short wavelengths is higher than the bulk of the cooler dust which dominates the mass .",
    "the warm dust dominates the light but the cool dust dominates the mass and a single temperature ( or even two temperatures as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not able to accommodate the temperature gradients .",
    "the cold - dust mass found by @xcite for izw18  is 70% of that found by h14 ; compensating for the differences in dust emissivities worsens slightly the discrepancy to @xmath065% .",
    "this value is also a factor of 2 below the lower limit of the range of dust mass estimated for izw18  by @xcite who use models by @xcite , even after compensating for the different emissivities adopted by the two groups .",
    "more physically realistic models which contemplate dust temperature gradients through variations in the interstellar radiation field that heats the dust tend to give larger dust masses than single - temperature mbb fits .    for sbs0335@xmath2052 , @xcite find a cold dust mass of dex3.06@xmath9 , roughly a factor of 30 below h14 . however , they estimate a  cold \" temperature of 57k , very close to the temperature of 59k discussed by h14 under the assumption of single - temperature dust , and thus do not take into account any cool dust .",
    "moreover , the dust in sbs0335@xmath2052  is optically thick at short wavelengths @xcite ; thus the assumption of optically thin dust emission implicit in mbb fitting is incorrect .",
    "the differences found in dust masses for sbs0335@xmath2052  and izw18  of roughly a factor of 100 are consistent with the differences in their integrated ir luminosity : @xmath23 for sbs0335@xmath2052  is @xmath24@xmath25 , while for izw18@xmath23=@xmath26@xmath25 .",
    "assuming the same mass - to - light ratio ( similar overall mean temperatures ) for the dust , this would give a factor of 80 in dust mass , inconsistent with the difference found by @xcite of roughly a factor of 5 for the cold dust masses in the two galaxies .",
    "this illustrates one of the difficulties of the mbb approach adopted by @xcite ; they use two temperatures and thus apply two different mass - to - light ratios ( roughly inverse temperature ) to the two ir integrals . as mentioned above , in galaxies like sbs0335@xmath2052  and izw18  most of the dust _ emission",
    "_ comes from warm dust , while most of the dust _ mass _ is cold .",
    "more emissive grain mixtures , as suggested by @xcite , would decrease the inferred dust mass by a factor 3 - 4 in both galaxies .",
    "a comparable reduction of the dust mass of sbs0335@xmath2052   ( @xmath27@xmath9 ) would be obtained by artificially imposing a low 870  dust flux ( 1@xmath28 below the reported h14 flux ) .",

    "part of the reason for this is that , at a given luminosity , the mass - to - light ratios are smaller for younger stellar populations ( see h14 for details ) .",
