    "the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ; boella et al .",
    "1997/a ) is one of the four narrow field instruments on board the beppo - sax satellite ( boella et al . 1997/b ) .",
    "the mecs operates in the energy band 1.3 - 10 kev with a field of view of @xmath0 radius .",
    "the mecs consists of three units each composed of a grazing incidence mirror unit ( mu ) , and of a position sensitive gas scintillation proportional counter ( gspc ) .",
    "+ the point spread function of the mecs ( psf@xmath1 ) is the convolution between the mu psf and the detector psf .",
    "the mu and detector psfs are described , respectively , by a lorentzian function l(r ) and a gaussian function g(r ) .",
    "both the lorentzian and the gaussian functions are energy - dependent . typically the detector psf improves with increasing energy , whereas the mu psf improves with decreasing energy .",
    "the detector psf dominates the core of the psf@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) whereas the mu psf dominates the wings of the psf@xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "+ the analytical expression for the on - axis psf as given in boella et al .",
    "1997/a is :    @xmath4}\\cdot\\ ] ]    @xmath5^{-m(e)}\\bigg\\},\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are algebraic functions of the energy e. + the integral of the psf over the entire plane is normalized to unity : + @xmath10 .",
    "+ we used eq . 1 to evaluate the @xmath11 and @xmath12 power radii ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) as a function of e : + -0.5truecm @xmath15 @xmath16    as shown in fig",
    ". 1 @xmath13 is always @xmath17 and decreases with increasing energy .",
    "this is because at radii @xmath17 the psf@xmath1 is dominated by the gaussian psf of the detector , that improves with increasing energy .",
    "the power radius @xmath14 does not vary strongly with energy ( see fig .",
    "1 ) because of the combined effect of the improvement of the detector psf and degradation of the mu psf with increasing energy .",
    "a proper analysis of extended sources , like clusters of galaxies , requires that the blurring introduced by the limited spatial resolution of the observing instruments be correctly taken into account . in practice",
    ", this is done by evaluating the convolution of the source surface brightness profile , @xmath18 , with the psf@xmath1 .",
    "we have approximated @xmath18 with the profile of the virgo cluster as observed with the pspc instrument on board the rosat satellite , because of the considerably better spatial resolution of this instrument respect to the mecs .",
    "+ the rosat virgo cluster profile , @xmath19 , convolved with the psf@xmath1 at any point p(@xmath20 ) in polar coordinates ( @xmath21 ) is : +    @xmath22    @xmath23    we computed the convolved profiles @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . + in order to estimate the spectral distortions introduced by the energy - dependent psf@xmath1 we calculated the ratios @xmath27 and @xmath28 . + as shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are contained within 0.09 of unity for any radius and within 0.06 for radii @xmath31 .",
    "the obvious implication is that spectral distortions introduced by the psf@xmath1 are quite modest .",
    "the spectra obtained from the mecs observations of clusters of galaxies are affected by the blurring effects of the psf@xmath1 . to correct these effects we computed correction vectors @xmath32 where i=1, .. ,256 are the energy channels of the mecs .",
    "these vectors @xmath32 are quantities that , multiplied by the spectrum of the cluster observed by the mecs , @xmath33 , give us the corrected spectrum of the cluster , @xmath34 :    @xmath35    we computed correction vectors for annular regions centered on the emission peak of the virgo cluster .",
    "we considered 5 annular regions with inner and outer radii of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the correction vector for the @xmath41 region spectrum , @xmath42 , is :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is defined by eq . ( 3 ) . +",
    "all the correction vectors evaluated for the considered regions are shown in fig .",
    "+ we note that : 1 ) @xmath45 has a mean value of @xmath46 , while all other correction vectors are contained between 0.9 and 1.0 .",
    "this is because the number of photons revealed is lower than the number of the photons emitted by the source , while the viceversa is true for the others four regions .",
    "2 ) all correction vectors show small variations with the energy and therefore the spectral distortions are modest .",
    "the observed , @xmath47 , and corrected , @xmath48 , spectra obtained from the annular regions described in the previous section have been used to measure temperature profiles .",
    "this has been done by fitting each spectrum in the energy range 1.4 - 5 kev with thermal emission model ( mekal in xspec ver .",
    "9.01 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we show the temperature profiles @xmath49 and @xmath50 obtained from the observed , @xmath47 , and the corrected , @xmath48 , spectra .",
    "the difference in value between @xmath49 and @xmath50 are negligible .",
    "this demonstrates that the effects introduced by the psf@xmath1 are very small .",
    "we compared our results with those of the rosat and asca satellites . to make this possible",
    "we fitted the spectra with the same models used by nulsen and b@xmath51hringer ( 1995 ) in the analysis of the rosat pspc data and by matsumoto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the analysis of the asca gis data : nulsen and b@xmath51hringer used a raymond - smith model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) in the energy band 0.5 - 2.4 kev , while matsumoto et al . used a thermal bremsstrahlung model plus gaussian line in the energy band 3 - 10 kev .",
    "we recall that for @xmath52 nulsen and b@xmath51hringer found temperatures in the energy range 1.1 - 2.3 kev , while matsumoto et al .",
    "found temperatures in the energy range 2.-2.3 kev .",
    "fitting the @xmath48 spectra with a raymond - smith model in the energy range 1.4 - 2.4 kev we found , basically , the same temperatures as in the rosat analysis . using a bremsstrahlung model plus a gaussian line in the energy range 3 - 10 kev we found temperatures consistent with those found from the asca gis analysis",
