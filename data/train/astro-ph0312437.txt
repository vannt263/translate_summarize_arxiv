    "the possibility of observing 21 cm emission from the `` cosmic dark ages '' was first recognized by @xcite and later developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to show the nature of the expected signal and demonstrate that future low frequency radio telescopes could measure this emission .",
    "this has inspired a significant amount of work , with important contributions by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others .",
    "just recently , @xcite showed that the predicted global step in reshifted 21 cm emission was an artifact of the small box size used in the simulation procedures .",
    "combined with the high thomson scattering cross section observed by wmap @xcite and other arguments , these results suggest that reionization is much more complicated than originally conceived @xcite .",
    "these theoretical developments coincide with the development of several advanced low frequency radio arrays which will come online by the end of the decade .",
    "recent advances in digital electronics are enabling the construction of radio arrays which directly sample the incoming wavefront with thousands of simple antennas and perform all signal processing in the digital domain .",
    "the digital processing simplifies the mechanical systems , allowing very large collecting areas at modest cost and enabling entirely new observing modes .",
    "one of the enabling digital processing technologies is the wide field correlator ( wfc ) developed at mit and the haystack observatory @xcite .",
    "the digitized signal from up to several thousand individual antennas can be fully correlated by the wfc , producing more than 1 billion individual visibility measurements .",
    "these visibilities allow the full field of view of the antennas to be imaged , and greatly increases the sensitivity of epoch of reionization ( eor ) observations by allowing both parallel observation of a large number of sky locations and by enabling new statistical analysis techniques ( see section [ analtechsection ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we show how wide field radio observations combined with statistical analysis techniques similar to those used in cmb experiments may be applied to studies of the eor .",
    "an analysis using statistical cmb techniques independently developed by @xcite has been recently published , where they show the usefulness of the eor power spectrum and that foreground contamination can be easily removed .",
    "our approach is similar but emphasizes the importance of the full three dimensional statistics inherent in the eor signal . by making full use of all the available information ,",
    "our technique is both more sensitive to the eor signal and provides additional handles for removing the foreground contamination .",
    "this paper complements the @xcite paper and details the experimental and analysis advances which will enable future radio arrays to make robust eor measurements using reasonable integration times .",
    "this discourse is divided into three major themes . in section [ wfcsection ] the basic design and wide field capabilities of future low frequency radio arrays",
    "are presented , followed by a description of the analysis technique enabled by the wide field of view in section [ analtechsection ] .",
    "sections [ powerspectrumsection ] and [ simplecasesection ] then present sensitivity calculations for wide field radio eor observations and the constraints they can provide .",
    "additional calculations and issues important to the eor field are detailed in the appendices .",
    "in contemporary and planned radio telescopes , the digitization happens as early as possible in the signal collection process and signal processing is performed in high speed digital electronics .",
    "this shift to early digitization dramatically affects the `` look '' of the array , with thousands of small elements replacing a few large parabolic antennas .",
    "this basic change in the design philosophy enables wide field observations but also places much greater demands on the backend digital processing .",
    "this section introduces the basic antenna design and the massively interconnected correlators that can scale to thousands of antennas . while none of the proposed arrays have been constructed , they all share the same basic design elements which are used as the basis for the following discussion .",
    "the individual receptor elements consist of simple dipoles .",
    "dipoles may then be grouped with an analog beamformer into antenna `` tiles . ''",
    "the more dipoles per tile , the larger the collecting area and smaller the field of view . depending on the the science goals , the number of dipoles per antenna is then chosen to optimize science return and cost . the 80  240 mhz prototype tile developed by the mit haystack observatory consist of 16 crossed dipoles , maximizing the collecting area at frequencies critical for eor studies at the expense of limiting the field of view to @xmath0 ( see figure [ hbantenna ] ) . after each antenna",
    "the signal is immediately digitized and all subsequent processing is done in the digital domain .",
    "wide field observations which image the full antenna field of view are enabled by the wide field correlator technology @xcite . since the number of visibilities grows as",
    "the square of the number of antennas , arrays with thousands of antennas require millions of baselines , necessitating a massively interconnected correlator technology .",
    "the wfc technology enables large arrays to be fully correlated at low cost by developing scalable techniques for handling millions of pairwise connections with a minimum of point - to - point connections .",
    "the wfc technology also addresses a number of additional technological issues to allow efficient use of fpga chips including time multiplexing to match bandwidth with chip speed , and data buffering and re - ordering to minimize on chip memory requirements .",
    "this architecture is very scalable , and the performance of future versions of the wfc should increase with moore s law providing even greater performance at very reasonable cost .",
    "the first generation wide field correlator ( wfc1 ) performs the pairwise correlations for 3072 antennas at 4 mhz bandwidth , producing 1.2 billion 16 khz visibilities ( see @xcite for a full description ) .",
    "the capacity of an fx correlator design can be approximated by the trillions of complex multiply and accumulates per second ( tcmacs ) performed , given by the number of baselines ( pairwise combinations of antennas ) times the bandwidth .",
    "the wfc1 has a performance of 38 tcmacs ( @xmath1 ) , and is expected use @xmath2 fpga chips on 42 boards with a hardware cost of under 1 million dollars us ( 2006 price ) . for massively interconnected correlators such as the wfc1 , the number of antennas can be traded for bandwidth with little additional cost as long as the number of tcmacs remains constant .",
    "the baseline observing program for wide field eor observations involves a few hundred hours of observations in a cold portion of the sky .",
    "while all of the foreground sources will be subtracted from the data , residual foreground contamination can be reduced by carefully choosing the observation direction",
    ". the observation location will be away from the galactic plane to reduce the strength of the galactic emission , and will be chosen to contain a minimum of bright sources in an area where the galactic emission is particularly smooth .",
    "the observing times are selected when the chosen location is at high elevation angle and the ionospheric conditions are particularly favorable . in practice",
    "this will mean observing for a couple of hours on many nearly consecutive nights when ionospheric conditions are at their best . with six months of observing ,",
    "a very clean data set can be obtained with a deep integration of a few hundred hours .",
    "the combination of very large effective area and wide field of view makes next generation low frequency observatories ideally suited to eor measurements . while the wide field of view can be thought of in the traditional sense as allowing @xmath3 hundred thousand simultaneous pointings , in the context of eor observations it is more productive to think in terms of the visibility measurements .",
    "as will be presented in the next section , the eor information is most easily extracted in the fourier representation , and one can think of the visibilities produced by the wfc1 as 1.2 billion independent measurements .",
    "this large number of independent measurements allows wide field radio observations to directly sample the statistical signature of the eor .",
    "in this section we introduce our statistical analysis of eor measurements in three parts . in the first part we introduce the formalism for calculating the three dimensional statistics of the eor signal .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the inherent symmetries of the statistics and how this can be used to separate residual foreground contamination from the eor signal in section [ symmetrysubsection ] , and a discussion of the non - gaussian properties of the statistics in section [ nongaussiansubsection ] .",
    "the formalism presented in section [ visstatintro ] parallels calculations for the cmb by @xcite extended to three dimensions , and is similar to calculations by @xcite and @xcite but uses fourier formalism to clearly illustrate the three dimensional nature of the problem and to highlight the symmetries and statistics which are explored in sections [ symmetrysubsection ] and [ nongaussiansubsection ] .",
    "the idea of using power spectra to measure the eor signal has been around for some time , but the power of the symmetries inherent in the three dimensional data set and the non - gaussian statistical properties of the signal have not been previously appreciated .      in wide field radio observations , the observed frequency of the redshifted 21 cm line maps to the line of sight distance of the source . while peculiar velocities mean this mapping is not exact  a small effect to be studied in future work ",
    "an approximate image cube can be formed by replacing the observed frequency with the equivalent line of sight distance .",
    "the resulting image cube is a full three dimensional tomograph of neutral hydrogen emission in the high redshift universe .",
    "the emission strength from neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization depends on the local hydrogen density , the fractional ionization , and the spin temperature of the gas , and gives us a differential specific intensity @xmath4 at the observed location with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation ( see appendix [ appendixbd ] for a full derivation of @xmath4 ) . because the 21 cm line is narrow and weak and the gas is optically thin , there is no significant absorption of background emission by neutral hydrogen nearer the observer .",
    "this allows us to directly form an image cube which represents the three dimensional emission of the neutral hydrogen .",
    "furthermore , a three dimensional fourier transform can be applied to the image cube to determine the spatial structure of the eor signal .",
    "this gives us four representations of the signal : @xmath5 the horizontal pairs in equation [ fsquare ] are related by fourier transforms and the vertical pairs are related by a change of variables from the observational quantities sky position @xmath6 and frequency @xmath7 ( and their inverses @xmath8 ) to the comoving distance @xmath9 ( and inverse @xmath10 ) .",
    "the upper left hand term is the brightness distribution of the 21 cm emission at the source while the lower left hand term is the observed image cube .",
    "similarly the upper right hand term gives the spatial structure of the eor signal and the lower right hand term is the spatial structure of the three dimensional image .",
    "the mapping between variables is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the frequency of the 21 cm line , @xmath13 is the transverse comoving distance @xcite , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the reference redshift at the middle of the observed data cube used for determining @xmath16 and @xmath17.the top line of equation [ fsquare ] is a familiar relationship from cosmology and the bottom line is a standard of radio astronomy .",
    "unfortunately the two different communities use different conventions for the fourier transform . in this paper we will use the transformation pair @xmath18 @xmath19 for transforming functions of position @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath20 @xmath21 for functions of the observation variables . while using two different definitions of the fourier transform",
    "is awkward , it allows us to use the standard notation of both cosmology and radio astronomy and avoids the inevitable confusion that would result from non - standard notation .",
    "it is this difference in transforms which explains the relative @xmath22 factors in equations [ thetar][fapprox ] .",
    "standard units are comoving mpc for @xmath23 , rad per comoving mpc for @xmath24 , radians for @xmath25 , hz for @xmath16 , wavelengths ( or equivalently rad@xmath26 ) for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and hz@xmath26 for @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are in proper coordinates instead of comoving coordinates , equations [ thetar][fapprox ] need to be divided by @xmath30 .",
    "note that while @xmath29 physically has the units of seconds , it is really acting as a stand - in for the spatial structure and is best thought of as an inverse distance.]@xmath31 to @xmath32 @xmath33 is then an exactly linear map to the line of sight distance and has the same scale as @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this alternate development leads to a kernel which must be added to the fourier transform relationship developed in equation [ visftrans ] and figure [ cubetransform ] . for almost all reasonable parameters the approximate relationship in equation [ fapprox ] is sufficient . ]    for an interferometric array the fundamental observable is the set of cross - correlations between the antenna elements @xmath36 , called visibilities in radio astronomy , and is related to the image cube and the fourier representation via fourier transforms .",
    "the fourier representation of the image cube @xmath37 is related to the measured visibilities via the one dimensional fourier transform along the frequency axis @xmath38 and the image cube is obtained by performing a two dimensional fourier transform in the sky coordinates @xmath39 these relationships are shown graphically in figure [ cubetransform ] .    in order to calculate the actual measured values of @xmath40 , @xmath4 , and @xmath41 , we need to understand the mapping from the true intensity distribution @xmath42 to the measured quantities",
    ". in particular , the finite field of view and bandwidth of the measurement truncates the fourier transform from the true brightness distribution to the measured visibilities .",
    "in what follows we neglect the curvature of the sky . for the purposes of examining the statistics of radio emission on the celestial sphere ,",
    "this assumptions is valid when @xmath43 @xcite . for our proposed observations",
    "the largest value of @xmath25 is @xmath44 , and we can adopt the two dimensional fourier relationships rather than the full statistical treatment of spherical harmonics .",
    "the condensed arrays are expected to be coplanar to a fraction of a wavelength at eor frequencies , so the `` w - term '' from relative antenna elevations may be neglected .",
    "additionally , the visibilities from the wide field correlator will be collected every 1/2 second and the baseline adjusted to allow tracking of a single patch of the radio sky .    the true distribution of the eor specific intensity is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 gives the fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen emission .",
    "this can be separated into a spin temperature component @xmath47 and the density terms , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the density of hydrogen and neutral hydrogen respectively . for a baryon density @xmath50 and a helium fraction @xmath51 , @xmath47 is given by @xmath52 when measured in jy str@xmath26 , and @xmath53 in brightness temperature units .",
    "@xmath47 captures the spin temperature dependence of the neutral hydrogen emission and @xmath54 includes the effects of density fluctuations and ionization fraction , and in general both terms are functions of position . with respect to the cmb radiation and not the cmb radiation plus the average contribution of the neutral hydrogen emission",
    "this choice of zero point differs from the convention used in derivations of cmb fluctuations , and can add a @xmath55-function at zero wavenumber to the power spectrum .",
    "this offset is very hard to measure in practice , and its contribution is ignored in the remainder of this paper .",
    "mathematically the zero point contribution can be removed by subtracting @xmath56 from equation [ truevis ] to redefine @xmath42 . ] a full derivation of @xmath47 along with definition of all terms is given in appendix [ appendixbd ] .    the first step in determining",
    "the measured quantity is to define the window function @xmath57 given by the instrumental field of view and bandwidth .",
    "this can be fourier transformed to obtain @xmath58 . since the measured brightness @xmath59 is given by multiplying the true brightness by the spatial window function , the measured fourier transform of the intensity",
    "is given by convolving the fourier transform of the true intensity @xmath60 with @xmath58 @xmath61 using equation [ truevis ] this can be rewritten as @xmath62 for a specific realization of @xmath46 . because model predictions of @xmath46 are statistical it is convenient to consider the average value . for the next several steps we will first sketch the derivation of the statistical relationship between the intensity and the neutral hydrogen fluctuations in @xmath63 space , where @xmath63 is a wave number vector in undefined units , but is used to stand in for @xmath10 or @xmath64 . after working through the derivation in the abstract @xmath63 space we will redo the analysis in physical units . rewriting equation [ measvis1 ] in the @xmath63 space",
    "we obtain @xmath65 we can use this to calculate the expectation value of two visibilities measured at two different locations @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xmath68 the model expectation for the fluctuations is spatially homogeneous ( no preferred point in space ) , so the expectation for the fourier transformed value @xmath69 has random phase .",
    "the statistical average @xmath70 due to the random phase , and this is not changed by multiplying by a deterministic function like @xmath71 . so the expectation value gives us : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and is the power spectrum of neutral hydrogen emission . in the cmb literature due to a different definition of the fourier",
    "transform relation ( see footnote [ ftnote ] , equations [ cft1 ] and [ cft2 ] ) , leading to a difference of @xmath74 in the results .",
    "] this is the result we were looking for which relates the statistical properties of the intensity to the power spectrum of emission fluctuations , and is equivalent to the standard cmb development extended to three dimensions . for cases of constant ionization fraction and spin temperature ,",
    "the analogy is even closer and @xmath75 becomes simply the power spectrum of the matter density fluctuations ( see section [ simplecasesection ] ) .",
    "this equation also shows a number of interesting features including the correlation length of the intensities .",
    "the easiest way to use this in an analysis is to compare the intensity of locations with themselves to obtain the power spectrum of the intensity fluctuations @xmath76    we can now repeat these steps using the observation units @xmath8 .",
    "equation [ viscorl ] gives the expectation for the intensity at two locations : @xmath77 for a single location this simplifies to @xmath78 for the specific case of observing a single small area of the sky , parseval s relation can be used to convert the convolution in equation [ pkconclusion ] to the integrals over the fourier space found in equations 12 and 13 of @xcite , as corrected by @xcite .",
    "the statistical distribution calculated in equation [ pkconclusion ] can be directly sampled using the 1.2 billion visibilities produced by the first generation wide field correlator . because of the correlation length introduced by the window function , not all of the visibilities measure independent values of @xmath40 ( there are @xmath79 million independent values of @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , because the visibilities are independent measurements their noise is uncorrelated , ) . ] and the uncertainty on values of @xmath40 which are measured by multiple visibilities is correspondingly reduced .",
    "the large number of well constrained @xmath40 measurements enabled by wide field radio observations allow the statistical distribution in equation [ pkconclusion ] to be directly sampled . in the following two subsections",
    "we explore how sampling the statistical distribution can help separate the eor signal from the residual foreground and provide additional constraints on the process of reionization .",
    "the statistics of the model predictions for the eor signal fall under the class of spatially _ homogeneous _ and _ isotropic _ random fields , since there is no preferred position or direction in space . the underlying isotropic symmetry of the random field can be used to set strong constraints on the expected signal properties . in the limit that the observed data are from the same epoch",
    ", the isotropy of the model implies that the fourier transform representation of the neutral hydrogen emission will be spherically symmetric since the expectation is the same in all directions .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the eor signal is an extraordinarily useful characteristic , and all the statistical characteristics of the signal will share this symmetry ( including all moments of the distributions , not just the power spectrum distribution developed in the previous section , see section [ nongaussiansubsection ] ) . the spherical symmetry can be used to differentiate the residual foreground signal from the eor and to directly measure the statistical properties of the observed signal .    due to the spherical symmetry ,",
    "all of the observations within a spherical shell of fourier space are drawn from the same statistical ensemble .",
    "we can thus combine all of the measurements within a spherical shell in fourier space to determine the underlying statistical distribution .",
    "the spherical symmetry is only approximate because the universe does evolve .",
    "however , the 4 mhz bandwidth of the baseline observations correspond to less than @xmath80 change in redshift , over which the approximation of no evolution holds quite well @xcite . techniques which take into account the expected deviations from spherical symmetry may be employed in the future .",
    "differentiating the very weak eor signal from the foreground emission of the milky way and extragalactic sources is one of the primary difficulties with the eor measurement .",
    "planned eor observations all involve selecting relatively cold and featureless portions of the milky way at high galactic latitude and carefully subtracting out the contributions of all known sources . however , the eor signal is so weak that residual subtraction errors and very faint foreground sources could still mask the desired signal @xcite .",
    "the question becomes how to separate the eor signal from the residual foreground contamination .",
    "fundamentally , the spherical symmetry of the eor signal is based on the combination of narrow line emission and redshift which allows one to form an isotropic image cube , where frequency maps to the line of sight distance ( see figure [ eor ] ) .",
    "this mechanism is not present for most of the foreground contaminants , which either have smooth continuum spectra or are local line sources . as discussed in the following paragraphs , both of these foreground types have a _ separable - axial _ symmetry where the specific intensity @xmath81 for the foreground has the form @xmath82 ( functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 are both complex ) .",
    "we can use the difference in symmetry between the spherical eor signal and the separable - axial residual foregrounds to distinguish the eor signal from the foreground contaminants .",
    "the most problematic smooth spectrum foreground consists of faint emission from galaxies at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the spectra of these sources is smooth in frequency ( no sharp lines ) and the spectral power law and curvature characteristics are independent of look direction . in the image cube , these sources map to all frequencies at a given spatial location , producing pencil lines of emission along the frequency axis ( the contribution need not be uniform along the pencil beam )",
    ". spatial clustering of these foreground sources can lead to features in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 fourier coordinates , but not in the @xmath29 coordinate since the emission does not map to a single frequency .",
    "this creates the separable - axial symmetry in the fourier space for the dominant emission from faint unsubtracted point sources ( see figure [ galfore ] ) .",
    "the strongest foreground signal is the diffuse synchrotron radiation from the milky way , though this foreground is probably one of the easiest to remove @xcite . because this emission is fairly smooth in both angle and frequency , the residual errors from this emission is concentrated at small wavenumbers in the fourier plane , as shown in figure [ diffore ] .",
    "there may well be weak small scale structure due to clumps in the galactic emission and free - free absorption , and the correlation properties of this weak small scale structure is unknown .",
    "however , since the emission is broadband the resulting contamination has the same separable - axial symmetry in the fourier representation as the smooth spectrum point sources .",
    "a more difficult local foreground is produced by radio recombination lines from our own galaxy .",
    "line emission will also be included in the foreground model and subtracted , but significant errors in predicting and removing the recombination lines is expected .",
    "however , in the image cube the residual recombination lines will appear as planes at set frequencies ( the magnitude and sign of a residual line may vary with position , but the frequency is set ) .",
    "this again leads to the separable - axial symmetry in the fourier cube .",
    "not all of the foregrounds have a separable - axial symmetry ",
    "any line source at cosmological distances will partially mimic the spherical symmetry of the eor signal .",
    "fortunately , no strong lines at frequencies near or below the 21 cm line are expected in the foreground signal .",
    "sources such as radio recombination lines in high redshift galaxies will be a confusing source , but this emission is expected to be very weak and will have a slightly elliptical symmetry due to differences in the frequency to redshift scaling .    additionally , the symmetry argument does not remove the issue of foregrounds .",
    "large residual foreground subtraction errors can swamp the eor signal regardless of symmetry ; the symmetry simply provides an additional handle for separating the foreground from the signal . the accuracy to which a given foreground needs to be subtracted depends on both its strength and the exact shape of the fourier signal from that source .",
    "for example , unsubtracted discreet foreground galaxies are relatively bright , but because they are spectrally smooth their contribution is largely confined to small @xmath29 values .",
    "radio recombination lines on the other hand are relatively weak , but due to the sharp spectral features may contain much more power at high @xmath29 values , though this depends critically on the characteristics of the radio recombination line subtraction process .",
    "the actual contribution of a residual foreground to the fourier representation can be directly calculated given both a model for the foreground signal and the foreground subtraction process .",
    "returning to the visibility cube @xmath85 , let us consider the errors made along the frequency dimension for fixed @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for smooth spectrum sources",
    "the two largest errors are going to be constant ( complex ) offsets at all frequencies due to residual source subtraction errors , and residual spectral slopes due to errors determining the spectra of the foreground sources .",
    "this suggests a taylor expansion of the residual errors along the frequency axis , with source subtraction errors providing the constant term , spectral index the first order term , and spectral curvature the higher order terms .",
    "the magnitude of the contamination is given by the probability of making a given error @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the complex error and @xmath88 is the order of the taylor expansion in the frequency dimension ( in general @xmath86 can be a function of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) . for the visibilities the error is given by sampling from the probability distribution @xmath86 at each order @xmath89 where @xmath41 is the visibility from the eor signal and @xmath90 includes the residual foreground subtraction errors .",
    "equation [ viserror ] can be fourier transformed along the frequency axis to give the contamination observed in the fourier representation @xmath91 for many foreground sources and subtraction algorithms the first few terms of the taylor expansion are expected to dominate .",
    "the spherical symmetry discussed here is largely independent of the source subtraction method , and can be used in conjunction with other methods to further reduce the effect of residual foreground contamination . because the proposed eor observations are many orders of magnitude deeper than existing measurements , the brightness and spectral characteristics of many of the foreground sources are poorly constrained .",
    "this makes estimating the residual contamination left by particular subtraction algorithms very difficult .",
    "measuring the foregrounds and studying the residual subtraction errors is the subject of several ongoing research programs and proposed observing campaigns around the world .",
    "our current understanding of the residual foregrounds can be summarized as follows .",
    "the smooth spectrum emission from the faint galaxy foreground can be removed using the spectral information , either by using the correlation of visibilities in widely separated frequency channels , or traditional spectral fitting techniques ( zaldarriaga et al .",
    "2004 ; briggs et al .",
    "private communication 2004 ) . both of these techniques will clean the faint point source foreground to a level less than the expected eor signal , and",
    "the spherical symmetry can be used to reduce it further . the smooth spectrum contribution from the milky way",
    "limits the sensitivity of the observations by being the dominant source of the thermal noise ( see section [ simplecasesection ] ) , however it is expected to be quite smooth and easily removed using traditional spectral fitting techniques . the residual foreground from radio recombination lines is more problematic due to uncertainties in the emission characteristics .",
    "radio recombination lines in our own galaxy will be measured and subtracted , but care must be taken to accurately determine the relative strength of the different emission lines to allow precision subtraction .",
    "accurately measuring the milky way radio recombination lines is one of the main motivations behind several current observational campaigns .",
    "the radio recombination lines from faint galaxies must be removed to high accuracy because they can mimic the spherical symmetry of the eor signal , however , they are quite weak .",
    "if radio recombination lines can be subtracted for sources above a few mjy and contribute 0.1% of the flux for sources weaker than this , their contribution to the total variance will be an order of magnitude fainter than the expected eor signal .",
    "the strong symmetry differences between the expected signal and the residual foreground contaminants provide an additional handle for separating the eor signal from most of the residual foregrounds . in practice ,",
    "the separation is probably best performed by modeling the residual effects of the foreground sources , and using a maximum likelihood analysis to identify the eor emission . in this type of analysis",
    "the difference in symmetry between the signal and the foregrounds provides one particularly powerful handle , which can be combined other statistical signatures to identify and measure the properties of the eor . in future work",
    "we plan to extensively model the foreground contamination and removal process to fully explore the effect of foreground sources .",
    "unlike the density fluctuations of the cmb , the eor signal is expected to be non - gaussian in nature .",
    "this is because the intensity of the eor signal is a function of the spin temperature of the gas and the local ionization fraction , in addition to the density fluctuations .",
    "while the density fluctuations are largely gaussian ( at least in the linear gravity regime ) , the spin temperature and ionization fraction may have a very complex distribution @xcite , and the overall statistical distribution is unlikely to have a gaussian distribution .",
    "the power spectrum is still the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function and as such is a uniquely important measure of the image statistics , and the development in section [ analtechsection ] is valid .",
    "but unlike with the gaussian fluctuations of the cmb , the power spectrum of the eor signal does not fully describe the underlying statistics ( see @xcite and @xcite for background on the weiner - khinchine theorem and related issues for non - gaussian random fields ) . in particular , the full shape of the statistical distributions within the spherical fourier annuli  the power spectrum is just the second moment of these distributions  and the global statistical distribution in the image cube may provide important information on the physics of reionization , including the history of the spin temperature and the characteristics of the reionization front . at this point",
    ", there is little theoretical guidance on the shape that the statistical distributions may take , but it is important to include these effects in future calculations as they may provide important information on the process of reionization .",
    "a full prediction of the expected power spectrum and other statistical signatures of the eor signal will require detailed monte carlo simulations . however , there are a few general features of the eor power spectrum which are expected . in this section",
    "we explore a couple of toy models to help build a conceptual understanding of the power spectrum characteristics and to demonstrate some of the information which can be extracted from the statistics of the eor signal .",
    "the first signature is the power spectrum of matter density fluctuations . for a simple model with uniform fractional ionization and spin temperature ,",
    "the eor signal is simply the primordial power spectrum ( see section [ simplecasesection ] and @xcite ) . generally , the amplitude of this signal depends on the spin temperature , the fractional ionization , and the gravitational growth of density fluctuations .",
    "there are a number of effects which could also distort the observed shape of the density fluctuation power spectrum , but at large spatial scales ( small @xmath10 ) local effects from non - uniform spin temperature and ionization bubbles should have little impact on the shape .",
    "thus we expect the power spectrum of density fluctuations to be present at some amplitude in all models of the eor ( see figure [ signal ] ) . one enticing possibility raised by this signature",
    "is the opportunity to constrain the cosmological equation of state if the effects of fractional ionization and spin temperature can be separated from the density fluctuation growth term @xcite .",
    "the second signature is due to the stromgren spheres which are expected to ionize the inter - galactic medium .",
    "these spheres are observed by the absence of neutral hydrogen emission on the ionized interior , and provide a strong power spectrum signal in most models developed to date .",
    "again , the the shape of small ionized regions may be strongly affected by local phenomena , but are expected to become somewhat spherical on large spatial scales as reionization progresses",
    ". the auto - correlation function of the stromgren spheres will be strongly centralized , and the fourier transform will have a @xmath92 like distribution .",
    "thus the process of reionization creates an increase in the power spectrum at small @xmath10 with a shoulder at the characteristic length scale of the stromgren spheres ( see figure [ signal ] and the simulations by @xcite ) .",
    "as the spheres enlarge the shoulder will move to smaller @xmath10 values and the amplitude of the power spectrum at small @xmath10 will increase .",
    "note also that the power spectrum will be distinctly different if the universe was ionized by a small number of quasars vs.  a large number of luminous galaxies .",
    "if a small number of luminous sources dominate reionization , the ratio of the ionization fraction to the characteristic size of the ionized regions will be much lower than if a large number of less luminous sources dominate reionization . by measuring the relative amplitude of the the small @xmath10 component of the power spectrum to the position of the shoulder",
    ", we can constrain how many sources participated in reionization of the universe ( see figure [ signal ] ) .",
    "these simple examples show the promise of studying the statistical properties of the eor signal .",
    "very recent results by @xcite indicate that reionization was complicated and patchy , and the power on very large length scales is expected to increase significantly .",
    "detailed monte carlo predictions of the expected statistical distributions are needed to allow even clearer differentiation between various models of structure formation and reionization .",
    "in this section we use the analysis technique developed in section [ analtechsection ] to determine the expected signal strength for a typical wide field radio observation . the model",
    "we will consider assumes a preheated spin temperature with no significant ionization and has been extensively discussed by @xcite , @xcite and others . for the instrument we will use the baseline design for the lofar observatory and assume a single 100 hour wide field radio observation analyzed using only the power spectrum .",
    "this case is useful for comparing with pervious work and sets a baseline sensitivity for this analysis technique .",
    "the exact sensitivity of any measurement depends intimately on the characteristics of the instrument .",
    "however , an estimate of the eor sensitivity can be developed using a few approximations .    for observations at 129 mhz ( z=10 ) with a uniformly heated medium ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath75 is just the constant @xmath94 jy@xmath95 str@xmath96 times the matter density power spectrum ( see appendix [ appendixunits ] for a discussion of units ) . the power spectrum of the matter density fluctuations is shown in figure [ powerspectrum ] , indicating the strong signature of the density fluctuations which will be imprinted on the eor signal .",
    "the function @xmath97 from equation [ pkconclusion ] is very sharply peaked , so we can make the approximation that the power spectrum is a constant on the length scale of @xmath97 and pull the matter density power spectrum out of the integral .",
    "( since in practice we are fully sampling the instrumental bandwidth , we are really performing a uniform average over @xmath29 in this argument and an equivalent answer can be obtained using a variation of parseval s relation for @xmath29 . ) if the response of the antennas can be described as constant to @xmath0 with 4 mhz bandwidth , the integral of @xmath97 is @xmath98 str hz by parseval s relation .",
    "the baseline lofar design is centrally condensed and does not evenly sample the @xmath99 space , but the magnitude of the condensation has yet to be determined . if we assume that the sampling varies as approximately as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , the average neutral hydrogen power spectrum is 0.74 str hz . combining all of these factors we obtain an average @xmath102 signal of @xmath103 jy@xmath95 hz@xmath95 .    the next step in calculating the sensitivity is to determine the thermal noise inherent in the measurements .",
    "the total thermal noise also depends on the distribution of antennas on the ground , but for a dense array may be approximated by the following argument . for a single dual polarization visibility measurement from a pair of high frequency antenna elements ( each with 16 dipoles )",
    "the thermal noise is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the width of the individual frequency channels , and @xmath106 is the duration of the observation . to calculate the noise on @xmath37",
    ", we need to fourier transform @xmath107 . since the noise in @xmath37 will be the same at all @xmath29 , we can calculate the noise at @xmath108 and generalize to the other values .",
    "@xmath109 becomes    [ ] @xmath110    where @xmath84 is the full bandwidth of the measurement .",
    "the rms of the sum is @xmath111 times the rms of @xmath41 times @xmath105 , and is given by @xmath112 using the values of @xmath113 = 695 k , @xmath114 = 2.32 m , @xmath106 = 100 h , and @xmath84 = 4 mhz gives @xmath115 jy hz .",
    "the background noise @xmath116 is gaussian distributed with rms @xmath117 .",
    "the expectation of the absolute value @xmath118 is then rayleigh distributed and the expectation of the absolute value squared @xmath119 is exponentially distributed with an rms of @xmath120 .",
    "this gives an rms for a single @xmath121 measurement of @xmath122 jy@xmath95 hz@xmath95 .",
    "if we average over a large number of visibilities , the mean @xmath123 will become gaussian distributed with width rms/@xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the number of visibility measurements in the sum . for our example we have 1.2 billion visibility measurements from the wide field correlator , giving an rms of @xmath126 jy@xmath95 hz@xmath95 for the thermal noise .",
    "comparing to the expected signal strength of @xmath103 jy@xmath95 hz@xmath95 results in a signal to noise ratio of @xmath127 for a single 100 h 4 mhz observation in the absence of significant foreground contamination , or equivalently a @xmath128 signal in 5 separate annular bins .",
    "this suggests that precision measurements of the power spectrum can be achieved using wide field radio observations and reasonable integrations .",
    "in this paper we discussed the power of wide field radio observations and introduced an analysis technique which we expect will efficiently extract the statistical properties of the eor signal and separate them from the residual foreground contamination . the next step in developing",
    "the experimental procedure is to use simulations to explore a number of subtle experimental effects and their impact on eor observations . using end - to - end simulations which include realistic foreground models and instrumental effects ,",
    "we intend to explore four major topics :    * foreground contamination and our ability to measure the eor power spectrum using various foreground subtraction methods and symmetry techniques . * ionospheric effects and calibration errors , and the impact on deep eor integrations . *",
    "array optimization to enhance the science return of eor measurements in future observatories . * statistical properties of theroetical models of reionization , and the ability of wide field radio observations to differentiate between eor models .",
    "it is clear that wide field radio observations can make an important contribution to the study of the early universe , and the above steps will help formulate a robust strategy for measuring and interpreting the eor signal .",
    "there are many people who have provided important contributions to this paper .",
    "ed bertschinger provided valuable feedback on early drafts of this paper , taught mfm the basics of cosmological statistics , and pointed out the importance of non - gaussian statistics .",
    "numerous other people have provided valuable feedback on various drafts and helped us develop our ideas through extensive discussions , including colin lonsdale , ger de bruyn , frank briggs , rennan barkana , al levine , and judd bowman .",
    "we also thank our low frequency radio team members at mit , haystack observatory , astron , and nrl .",
    "this work has been supported by nsf grant ast0121164 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath129 is related to the absorption coefficient @xmath130 by ( see , for example , @xcite equation 1.26 ) @xmath131 under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium applicable for a thermalized neutral hydrogen gas the absorption coefficient is given by @xmath132 from @xcite equation 1.80 , where @xmath133 is the frequency , @xmath134 the number density of lower quantum states , @xmath135 the einstein absorption coefficient , @xmath136 is the temperature of the spin states of the neutral hydrogen and @xmath137 is the line profile .",
    "the relation between the absorption coefficient @xmath135 and the transition probability for spontaneous emission @xmath138 with the number of states in the upper and lower energy levels given by @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively is @xmath141 which we can then use to obtain @xmath142    for the 21 cm line of hydrogen , the factor @xmath143 is 0.068 k. this is a much lower temperature than the cmb radiation , and for almost all cases the spin temperature @xmath136 will be warmer than this even when the 21 cm line is seen in absorption . making the approximation @xmath144 we find @xmath145 using the same approximation",
    "we can also show that the hydrogen will be equally distributed between all of the @xmath146 quantum states .",
    "for the 21 cm transition @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this then implies that the @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the number density of neutral hydrogen at the given redshift and implicity includes the density fluctuations ( the units have not been defined yet ) . inserting these values we obtain @xmath151    now to calculate the optical depth we need to perform the integration in equation [ oddef ] . because the 21 cm line is extremely narrow all of the optical depth is constrained to a specific redshift @xmath15 .",
    "effectively @xmath137 becomes a @xmath55-function over the line of sight variable @xmath152 .",
    "we can thus rewrite the equation using @xmath153 and perform the integral to obtain @xmath154 where we have evaluated the frequency terms from the transition strength at the 21 cm line and left the @xmath155 conversion from length scale to @xmath15 until we explicitly decide on units in equation [ unitstep ] below .",
    "we can now use the optical depth to obtain the specific intensity at the source of the 21 cm emission . from @xcite equation 1.30 the specific intensity after the emission region ( @xmath156 )",
    "is given in terms of the background brightness @xmath157 , which is dominated by the cosmic microwave background , and the emission brightness of the neutral hydrogen @xmath158 via @xmath159 the difference between the background and the neutral hydrogen emission is then given by @xmath160 where the last relation follows from the small optical depths associated with the 21 cm line .",
    "the final step in the process is to propagate the radiation from the emission region to the earth .",
    "the number density @xmath150 is related to the mean hydrogen density @xmath161 times the neutral hydrogen density fluctuations @xmath162 we now have to decide on the units we will use for @xmath150 , @xmath155 and the relativistic propagation relationship .",
    "here we choose the units of the emission region to be proper mpc , though all unit choices will give the same answer .",
    "since the average neutral hydrogen density is locked to the hubble flow , the mean density evolves as @xmath163 .",
    "the mean hydrogen density can then be defined in terms of the present value of the cosmological baryon density @xmath164 to obtain @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the helium fraction , @xmath167 is the gravitational constant , @xmath168 is the physical baryon density , @xmath169 is the hubble constant , and @xmath170 is the mass of a hydrogen atom .",
