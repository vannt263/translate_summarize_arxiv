    "highly energetic jets born from initial hard collisions provide natural `` tomography '' of the hot qcd matter created in a heavy ion collision .",
    "jet quenching due to energy loss along the jet path through the medium encodes essential information about the dynamics of jet - medium interaction and the medium properties as well , which shall be inferrable from experimental observables such as high @xmath0 hadron suppression and di - hadron correlations ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the jet quenching has been experimentally established as a very robust phenomenon , the microscopic mechanism of energy loss is not yet fully understood .",
    "the geometric features of jet quenching observables are particularly useful in discriminating different models of energy loss .",
    "these include :    a - dependence : : :    how the jet energy loss depends on the size of the colliding    systems(e.g .",
    "cucu ) ; b - dependence : : :    how the jet energy loss changes with the medium `` thickness '' at    varied collision impact parameter ; @xmath2-dependence : : :    how the jet energy loss is related to its azimuthal angle    @xmath2 with respect to the reaction plane .    for any given dynamical or phenomenological model , one can fix the model parameters by fitting data in the most central collisions and then `` predict '' the above geometric dependence as a crucial test of the model .",
    "let s focus on the @xmath2-dependence . in non - central collisions ,",
    "the medium `` thickness '' as seen by a penetrating jet depends on the azimuthal angle of the jet with respect to the reaction plane therefore leading to the reaction - plane dependence of high-@xmath0 hadron suppression i.e. @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is directly related to the azimuthal anisotropy parameter for high-@xmath0 hadrons , @xmath4 . despite the success of many models in describing the overall `` opacity '' or nuclear modification factor @xmath5 and its centrality dependence ,",
    "it was known for long time that almost all of those models significantly under - predicted the @xmath4 and failed the test by geometric data @xcite@xcite .",
    "the lack of a simultaneous description for @xmath5 and @xmath4 in a single model was not resolved till a new insight suggested in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the `` magnetic scenario '' for sqgp @xcite , the authors of @xcite pointed that the energy loss of a jet may not simply scale with the local medium density as most models have assumed , but actually have nontrivial dependence on matter density ( or temperature ) .",
    "it was particularly shown that including a jet quenching component with strong enhancement in the near-@xmath1 matter successfully explains the geometric data for the first time .",
    "such an enhancement of jet - medium interaction may originate from non - perturbative structures created by the ( color-)electric jet passing a plasma of ( color-)magnetic monopoles that dominate the near-@xmath1 matter @xcite,@xcite .",
    "more recently there appeared another class of jet quenching models with a much stronger path - length dependence of energy loss @xmath6 than the usual @xmath7 dependence from lpm effect for multiple gluon radiation , which also managed to describe the @xmath5 and @xmath4 data at the same time @xcite@xcite .",
    "the strong path - length dependence in these models was motivated by ads / cft calculations for certain strongly coupled yang - mills plasma .",
    "the two different models both generate large @xmath4 ( for fixed @xmath5 ) because they both enhance the energy loss in the outer - layer of fireball where the eccentricity is larger @xcite . we therefore have seen that the geometric data at rhic can be explained only by models incorporating non - perturbative jet quenching mechanism .    in this contribution , we will discuss geometric models of jet quenching without and with ( varied ) non - perturbative elements by confronting them with high - precision rhic data as well as by comparison with preliminary lhc data .",

    "geometric models for jet quenching , though lacking many dynamical details , reflect the general geometric features ( e.g. the path - length dependence ) that are most crucial for describing geometric data @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in such models the final energy @xmath11 of a jet with initial energy @xmath12 after traveling an in - medium path @xmath13 can be parameterized as @xmath14 with the suppression factor @xmath15 given by : @xmath16\\ , s(l)\\ , l^m dl   \\right\\}\\ ] ] in the above the @xmath17 is the entropy density of local matter at a given point on the jet path , while the @xmath18 is the local jet quenching strength which as a property of matter should in principle depend on the local density @xmath17 . after averaging over all jet paths ( including all possible start points and orientations ) one may obtain the nuclear modification factor : @xmath19 where the exponent @xmath20 comes from measured reference p - p spectrum ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed account ) .",
    "alternatively one may also study the reaction - plane dependence by averaging over jet paths with a particular azimuthal orientation , i.e. @xmath21 from which @xmath4 is derivable .",
    "we study three classes of models here :    @xmath7 model : : :    assuming @xmath22 ( i.e. square path - length dependence as per    lpm ) and @xmath23 as a constant ( i.e. energy    loss simply proportional to local density ) which are common features    of most jet energy loss models ; near-@xmath1 enhancement model : : :    also assuming @xmath22 but introducing a strong jet quenching    component in the vicinity of @xmath1 ( with density    @xmath24 and span of @xmath25 ) via    @xmath26 $ ] with    @xmath27 ( see @xcite for details ) ; @xmath10 model : : :    assuming @xmath28 ( i.e. cubic path - length dependence ) while    keeping @xmath23 as a constant .    after fixing the parameter of each in the most central collisions at rhic 200gev",
    ", one can then compare the predictions for @xmath5 and @xmath4 at different centralities from each model with phenix data@xcite : see fig.[fig_rhic ] .",
    "while all three describe @xmath5 very well , the @xmath7 model generates too little @xmath4 and only the near-@xmath1 enhancement model and the @xmath10 model can account for the sizeable anisotropy .",
    "therefore we emphasize again that the geometric data of jet quenching at rhic strongly favor models with certain non - perturbative mechanisms .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the last two models could be further distinguished : this could be answered by applying the models ( calibrated at rhic ) to lhc collisions and comparing with data . in fig.[fig_lhc ] we present for the first time such a comparison with very preliminary lhc data as extracted from plots in pertinent experimental talks by atlas and alice at quark matter 2011 @xcite . from the figure",
    "one can see that:1 ) both @xmath7 and @xmath10 models somewhat over - quench the jets while the near-@xmath1 model gives a fairly good description of @xmath5 ; 2 ) the @xmath10 model continues to predict a strong anisotropy overshooting the data while the @xmath4 from @xmath7 and near-@xmath1 models are in reasonable agreement with data .",

    "to conclude , by studying geometric models of jet quenching at both rhic and lhc energies , we have shown that the model assuming a non - perturbative component with strongly enhanced jet quenching in near-@xmath1 matter are best supported by the geometric data .",
    "we point out in passing that such a scenario , featuring non - monotonic dependence of transport properties on matter density / temperature near the phase boundary , has many supportive evidences from various other studies on jet quenching , fragmentation , heavy quark , viscosity and energy loss relation , etc@xcite .",
