    "in this paper ideas from the theory of hamiltonian systems are used to obtain both necessary and sufficient stability conditions by a variational procedure .",
    "the proposed procedure is of general utility , but the treatment here will be confined to plane parallel inviscid shear flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this introduction",
    "we give a sketch the underlying basis for the procedure in terms of a finite - dimensional hamiltonian framework , and then place the present contribution in the context of the many previous results for shear flow .",
    "for some hamiltonian systems , the sign of the curvature of the potential energy function provides a necessary and sufficient condition for stability .",
    "this is referred to as lagrange s theorem , which is the crux of many fluid and plasma stability results including the ` @xmath0 ' energy principle of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd )  @xcite . for a more general class of hamiltonian systems , definiteness of the hamiltonian hessian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium point of interest",
    "provides only a sufficient condition for stability .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as dirichlet s theorem , which is the crux of many sufficient conditions for stability in the fluid and plasma literature .",
    "the essential reason that dirichlet s theorem does not provide a necessary condition for stability is the possible existence of negative energy modes .",
    "negative energy modes are modes of undamped oscillation , for which the hamiltonian is negative when the mode is excited . for stable ( nondegenerate ) hamiltonian systems of @xmath1 degrees - of - freedom",
    "the linear dynamics can be brought by a canonical transformation into the following normal form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the canonically conjugate coordinates , @xmath4 are positive real numbers representing the mode frequencies , and @xmath5 are the signatures of the mode , often called kren signature , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponding to positive and negative energy modes , respectively .",
    "evidently , systems with both positive and negative energy modes are linearly stable , but do not have a definite hessian matrix .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for review . )",
    "an advantage afforded by lagrange s criterion over dirichlet s is the powerful rayleigh - ritz variational method  @xcite , which underlies the mhd and other energy principles . with this method",
    "one need only produce a trial function that makes the rayleigh quotient negative in order to show instability and , also in this way , threshold parameter values for the transition to instability can be determined .",
    "when this method is applicable , it is of great utility because linear stability conditions for interesting fluid and plasma systems are generally difficult to derive theoretically .",
    "however , it only applies to a restricted class of hamiltonian systems for which the eigenvalue problem is self - adjoint , i.e , systems with steady state bifurcations to instability through zero frequency that have pure exponential growth upon transition , and it is known that systems with shear flow are not self - adjoint and have instead kren bifurcations @xcite to overstability , i.e. , unstable eigenvalues with both nonzero real and imaginary parts . such bifurcations are often called hamiltonian - hopf bifurcations@xcite and can be viewed as a resonance between positive and negative energy modes leading to instability .    thus we are led to re - examine dirichlet s principle and seek an alteration that affords the utility of the rayleigh - ritz variational method for investigation of kren bifurcations . for finite - dimensional hamiltonian system written in the normal form of , it is evident that @xmath8 is a constant of motion for each @xmath9 . from these constants of motion",
    "one can construct a constant of motion with definite hessian simply by flipping the signs of the signature in the normal form hamiltonian .",
    "unfortunately , a priori knowledge of the existence of such a definite constant of motion is generally not at hand , and one must actually solve the eigenvalue problem in order to be informed of its existence . this is the essential reason dirichlet s theorem does not give both necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and a rayleigh - like variational method is not at hand .",
    "however , there are two related discoveries that we can exploit to circumvent this deficiency for problems with continuous spectra , such as those related to the vlasov equation , mhd , and the plane shear flow problem considered here .",
    "the first is the infinite sequence of constants of motion discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which were elaborated on in @xcite and used in the present context in @xcite .",
    "the second is the discovery of a kren - like signature for the continuous spectra of vlasov - poisson equilibria in @xcite , which was applied to plane shear flow in @xcite and extended to a large class of systems in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these constants of motion in conjunction with the definition of signature allow the construction of a quadratic form , which we will call @xmath10 , the variation of which can be used in a manner akin rayleigh s principle for ascertaining stability . a version of the quadratic form @xmath10 was previously given in @xcite , but it was not used to obtain sufficient conditions for instability .",
    "we note in passing that the discovery of signature for the continuous spectrum has also led to rigorous kren - like theorems @xcite , where discrete eigenvalues emerge from the continuous spectrum , termed continuum hamiltonian hopf bifurcations .",
    "( see also @xcite on infinite - dimensional hamiltonian systems and many other contributions in the recent book @xcite . )",
    "there have been many significant contributions to the classical plane parallel shear flow problem ; thus , it is important to put our contribution into perspective , which we do here .",
    "the most famous condition is rayleigh s criterion  @xcite that stipulates the existence of an inflection point in the velocity profile is necessary for instability , a criterion that was improved by fjrtoft  @xcite .",
    "these criteria were obtained by direct manipulation of rayleigh s equation ( see equation below ) , which governs linear disturbance about a base shear flow .",
    "the first allusion to hamiltonian structure for this system appears in the works of arnold  @xcite who obtained more general sufficient conditions for stability by making use of additional invariants .",
    "this idea was anticipated in the plasma physics literature  @xcite , where the additional invariants were referred to as generalized entropies ; today the generalized entropies are referred to as casimir invariants and the general procedure is called the energy - casimir method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite it was shown explicitly that all of the above criteria amount to a version of dirichlet s theorem for this infinite - dimensional hamiltonian system , where it was also shown how to explicitly map the system into the infinite - dimensional version of the normal form of . in this way a signature for the continuous spectrum was first defined for this system , by paralleling the analogous procedure for the vlasov - poisson system  @xcite .",
    "arnold also introduced an important kind of constrained variation he termed isovortical perturbations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which are a special case of the dynamically accessible variations of @xcite that are generated by poisson brackets @xcite .",
    "isovortical perturbations together with a more general dirichlet - like sufficient condition for shear flow due to barston @xcite play important roles for obtaining the results of the present paper .",
    "we also note that prior to our variational approach , necessary and sufficient stability conditions were obtained for certain classes of shear flows using two other non - hamiltonian approaches .",
    "one is the perturbation expansion around a neutrally stable eigenmode , which was pioneered by tollmien  @xcite and developed by many authors  @xcite , and the other is analysis based on the nyquist method  @xcite ( applied to magnetohydrodynamics in @xcite ) .",
    "these two approaches , however , require detailed probing of rayleigh s equation to obtain information under specific conditions .",
    "our variational approach is not only consistent with these earlier results , but also advantageous in that we do not have to solve rayleigh s equation in a rigorous manner .",
    "namely , we can prove the instability by simply finding a test function ( in the appropriate function space ) that makes our quadratic form @xmath10 positive .",
    "this is useful because explicit solutions for rayleigh s equation are generally not available for a given velocity profile .",
    "moreover , in numerical calculation , one can obtain stability boundaries more efficiently from this variational problem ( i.e. , the maximization of @xmath10 ) , compared to solving rayleigh s equation .",
    "we emphasize that our approach is not limited to shear flow with rather simple velocity profiles , but the same idea is applicable to various fluid and plasma stability problems to which it can be of practical use .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rayleigh ] , rayleigh s equation is first introduced , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : theorem ] the notion of isovortical variation is reviewed .",
    "here we describe the quadratic form @xmath10 , which provides the necessary and sufficient conditions if the velocity profile satisfies the assumptions of analyticity and monotonicity .",
    "in particular , we present the main theorem of this work ( theorem  [ th : multiple ] ) , in which the quadratic form @xmath10 is given explicitly .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec : proof ] , the proof of the main theorem is given .",
    "here , we first focus on restricting perturbations to the appropriate function space , and then perform the spectral decomposition in a rigorous manner , which largely reproduces the well - known spectral properties of rayleigh s equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "next , we calculate the signature of @xmath10 by applying techniques  @xcite for the action - angle representation of continuous spectrum , where the positive signature of @xmath10 indeed predicts the existence of unstable eigenvalues . finally , in sec .  [",
    "sec : proof ] , we show that the function space ( the search space on which @xmath10 should be maximized ) can be extended to a larger one , which is actually beneficial for solving the variational problem more effectively .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "we consider the linear stability of inviscid parallel shear flow @xmath11 on a domain @xmath12\\times[-\\infty,\\infty]$ ] bounded by two walls at @xmath13 , where the flow is assumed to be incompressible and two - dimensional . by introducing the @xmath14-component of the vorticity disturbance as @xmath15 for a wavenumber @xmath16 , the linearized vorticity equation is written as @xmath17 where the prime ( @xmath18 ) indicates the @xmath19 derivative , and the convolution operator @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 with a kernel , @xmath22 the stream function @xmath23 is therefore given by @xmath24 or @xmath25 . by assuming an exponential behavior @xmath26 with a complex frequency @xmath27",
    ", the eigenvalue problem for is known as rayleigh s equation  @xcite ; @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a complex phase speed .",
    "if this equation has a nontrivial solution @xmath30 for @xmath31 with a positive imaginary part , @xmath32 , the linearized system is spectrally unstable due to an exponentially growing eigenmode .",
    "hamiltonian structure of the linearized vorticity equation   is highly related to its adjoint equation for @xmath33  @xcite ; @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the adjoint operator of @xmath36 with respect to the inner product , @xmath37 since the relation @xmath38 holds , @xmath39 is found to be a solution of if @xmath40 is a solution of .",
    "this class of perturbations belonging to the range of @xmath41 is said to be isovortical because the vorticity disturbance ( @xmath42 ) is induced by a displacement ( @xmath40 ) of the fluid while preserving the conservation law of circulation  @xcite . in this manner",
    ", arnold  @xcite derived a constant of motion , @xmath43dx,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath40 .",
    "arnold showed that this is the second variation of the energy with respect to the isovortical variation , while in @xcite it was shown that this quantity is in fact the hamiltonian for the linear hamiltonian dynamics and there the diagonalizing transformation to action - angle variables was first obtained .",
    "when @xmath45 has only one inflection point @xmath46 [ i.e. , @xmath47 , then in a frame moving at the velocity @xmath48 arnold replaced @xmath49 by @xmath50 in @xmath51 to obtain @xmath52dx\\nonumber\\\\   = & \\int_{-l}^{l}\\overline{w}\\left(\\frac{u - u_i}{u''}+{\\mathcal{g}}\\right)w dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xcite it was shown explicitly that @xmath53 is in fact the second variation of the full hamiltonian in the inertial frame boosted by velocity @xmath48 by adding the appropriate total momentum .",
    "thus , we have a version of dirichlet s theorem , where the shear flow @xmath45 is stable in the sense of lyapunov , if the quadratic form @xmath53 is either positive or negative definite , i.e. , @xmath54 such that @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath57 for all @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath53 is clearly positive definite and hence proves stability , which implies that this variational criterion of arnold  @xcite applies to a larger class of flow profiles than rayleigh - fjrtoft s stability theorem  @xcite .",
    "however , all these criteria , including a generalization by barston @xcite , are still sufficient conditions for stability and , hence , are indeterminate when @xmath53 is indefinite , since as discussed in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] there could be negative energy modes .",
    "in this work , we obtain an improved variational criterion , but this requires introducing the following assumptions on @xmath45 .    * assumption *    ( a1 ) _ @xmath45 is an analytic and bounded function on @xmath59 $ ] . _",
    "@xmath45 is strictly monotonic [ i.e. , @xmath60 for all @xmath19 ] and , if @xmath62 at @xmath63 , then @xmath64 .",
    "_    the last statement implies that the inflection point @xmath46 must be a simple zero of @xmath65 and the sign of @xmath65 must change at @xmath63 .",
    "we expect that it is not difficult to relax these restrictions on @xmath45 _ except for _ the monotonicity . to simplify our mathematical arguments we will not pursue generalization in the present work , but we do remark upon this point in our summary of sec .",

    "our main result is that a necessary and sufficient condition for spectral stability is attained by the following variational criterion .",

    "this @xmath82 is equivalent to the constant of motion derived by barston [ 11 ] ( except for the coefficient @xmath83 ) , and @xmath84 for the case of single inflection point .",
    "hence , our theorem claims that arnold - barston s stability criteria ( dirichlet sufficient stability conditions ) are in fact necessary and sufficient when @xmath45 satisfies ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) .",

    "<S> a necessary and sufficient condition for linear stability of inviscid parallel shear flow is formulated by developing a novel variational principle , where the velocity profile is assumed to be monotonic and analytic . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that unstable eigenvalues of rayleigh s equation ( which is a non - selfadjoint eigenvalue problem ) can be associated with positive eigenvalues of a certain selfadjoint operator . </S>",
    "<S> the stability is therefore determined by maximizing a quadratic form , which is theoretically and numerically more tractable than directly solving rayleigh s equation . </S>",
    "<S> this variational stability criterion is based on the understandings of kren signature for continuous spectrum and is applicable to other stability problems of infinite - dimensional hamiltonian systems . </S>"
