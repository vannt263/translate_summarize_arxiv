    "quantum optics has proved a fertile field for experimental tests of quantum information science .",
    "however , quantum optics was not thought to provide a practical path to efficient and scalable quantum computation .",
    "this orthodoxy was challenged when knill et al.@xcite showed that , given single photon sources and single photon detectors , linear optics alone would suffice to implement efficient quantum computation . while this result is surprising ,",
    "the complexity of the optical networks required is daunting .",
    "more recently it has become clear that other , quite different versions of this paradigm are possible . in particular , by encoding the quantum information in multi - photon coherent states , rather than single photon states , an efficient scheme which is elegant in its simplicity has been proposed @xcite . the required resource , which may be produced non - deterministically , is a superposition of coherent states . given this , the scheme is deterministic and requires only relatively simple linear optical networks and photon counting .",
    "unfortunately the amplitude of the required resource states is prohibitively large .",
    "here we build on this idea and show that with only a moderate increase in complexity a scheme based on much smaller superposition states is possible .",
    "the idea of encoding quantum information on continuous variables of multi - photon fields @xcite has led to a number of proposals for realizing quantum computation in this way @xcite .",
    "one drawback of these proposals is that `` hard '' , non - linear interactions are required `` in - line '' of the computation",
    ". these would be very difficult to implement in practice .",
    "in contrast , this proposal requires only ",
    "easy , linear in - line interactions .",
    "the hard interactions are only required for `` off - line '' production of resource states .",
    "a related proposal is that of gottesman et al @xcite in which superpositions of squeezed states are used to encode the qubits . in that proposal",
    "the hard interactions are only used for the initial state preparation .",
    "however , quadratic , squeezing type interactions , are required in - line along with linear interactions .",
    "this paper is laid out in the following way .",
    "we start by describing the basic principles of the scheme . in sections iii and",
    "iv we describe realistic measurement and resource production techniques respectively , based on photon counting and linear optics . in section v we consider error correction and we conclude in section vi .",
    "the output of a single mode , stabilized laser can be described by a coherent state , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a complex number which determines the average field amplitude .",
    "coherent states are defined by unitary transformation of the vacuum @xcite , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the displacement operator .",
    "let us consider an encoding of logical qubits in coherent states with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where we take @xmath1 to be real @xcite .",
    "these qubits are not exactly orthogonal , but the approximation of orthogonality is good for @xmath1 even moderately large as @xmath6",
    ". we will assume for most of this paper that @xmath7 , which gives @xmath8 .",
    "measurement of the qubit values can be achieved with high efficiency by homodyne detection with respect to a local oscillator phase reference .    of course , if one wished , an exactly orthogonal qubit code can easily be defined in terms of the orthogonal parity eigenstates , @xmath9 .",
    "however such states are only a single ( nonunitary ) qubit gate away from the code we propose to use .",
    "the issue is not so much the orthogonality of the qubit code , but rather the need to work outside the qubit space during qubit processing .",
    "as we shall now show , this can be done with negligible error .",
    "* bit - flip gate*. the logical value of a qubit can be flipped by delaying it with respect to the local oscillator by half a cycle .",
    "thus the @xmath10 or `` bit - flip '' gate is given by @xmath11 this is a unitary gate . as already noted , the hadamard gate ( or its equivalents ) which effects transformation from @xmath12 to @xmath13 can not be unitary .",
    "this is because the logical basis states are not orthogonal but the states @xmath13 are parity eigenstates which are orthogonal .",
    "for this reason we now consider nonunitary gates based on projective measurement .",
    "gates based on projective measurements will be probabilistic in their operation .",
    "* sign - flip gate*. a bit flip in the superposition basis , ie a `` sign flip '' or @xmath14 gate , can be achieved via teleportation @xcite as follows .",
    "a resource of coherent superposition states ( commonly referred to as `` cat '' states ) , @xmath15 . a bell basis measurement",
    "is then made on the qubit state , @xmath16 , and one half of the entangled state ( where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are arbitrary complex numbers ) .",
    "depending on which of the four possible outcomes are found the other half of the bell state is projected into one of the following four states with equal probability : @xmath19 the bit flip errors in results three and four can be corrected using the @xmath10 gate .",
    "after @xmath10 correction the gate has two possible outcomes : either the identity has been applied , in which case we repeat the process , or else the required transformation @xmath20 has been implemented . on average",
    "this will take two attempts .",
    "we write @xmath21 meaning the teleportation transformation , @xmath22 , with bit - flip correction , @xmath10 , is applied @xmath23 times , where @xmath23 is outcome dependent .    our remaining gates implement operations which may conveniently be described by the product operator notation @xmath24 where @xmath25 can take on the values , @xmath10 , @xmath26 , @xmath14 or @xmath27 ( the pauli sigma operators and the identity ) . for single qubit operations we will drop the redundant identity ( @xmath27 ) operation on the second qubit",
    "* phase rotation gate*. consider an arbitrary single qubit rotation about @xmath14 , @xmath28 .",
    "this can be implemented by shifting our qubit a small distance out of the computational basis and then using teleportation to project back .",
    "we begin by displacing our arbitrary input qubit by a small amount in the imaginary direction ( see fig.1(a ) )    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in order to compute the overall fidelity of this operation , we first construct the mixed state @xmath29 representing the output of the teleportation operation for all measurement results @xmath30 the fidelity is then given by @xmath31 we plot @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphaandtheta ] .",
    "we can obtain a fidelity of 0.99 or above for any desirable angle if we can produce qubits with @xmath36 .",
    "a second strategy would be to limit our operation of @xmath28 to small angles .",
    "larger rotations could be built from repeated applications of a high fidelity gate .",
    "for example the fidelity for @xmath37 is @xmath38 when @xmath35 . repeating this 8 times implements @xmath39 with a fidelity of @xmath40 .",
    "compare this with the fidelity of @xmath41 when performing @xmath39 in a single step .        yet",
    "a third strategy emerges if we are willing to operate the logic gate in a non - deterministic fashion , in which the gate sometimes fails and must be repeated with a new copy of the qubit .",
    "qubits can be protected from destruction if we use the gate teleportation scheme of @xcite as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid210 ] and discussed in the previous section .",
    "we can then simply discard @xmath28 attempts for which the measurements of @xmath42 and @xmath43 yield low values for the product @xmath44 .",
    "suppose we choose a set @xmath45 of @xmath46 pairs which are accepted as successful operations of the logic gate , and @xmath47 is the probability to measure a member @xmath45 during the teleportation .",
    "the total output of the logic gate ( when it succeeds ) is then the mixed state @xmath48 we can now operate this logic gate with a fidelity which is very close to one . of course , this is limited by the maximum possible value of @xmath44 ( 0.999995 for @xmath35 and @xmath49 with the worst case qubit ) .",
    "suppose we insist on performing @xmath28 with a fidelity of 0.99 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] we plot @xmath47 as a function of @xmath1 under this restriction .",
    "this allows us to make estimates of the number of bell - cat states required to perform a single @xmath28 . in the gate teleportation scheme ,",
    "each attempt to perform @xmath28 requires 2 bell - cat states , so on average we need @xmath50 bell - cats . because there is a 50% probability of performing @xmath51 , during the gate teleportation , we need an additional @xmath50 bell - cats to correct this .",
    "because @xmath14 commutes with @xmath28 it is not necessary to perform @xmath14 after each teleportation ; instead we can wait and perform only one @xmath14 after all teleportations are complete .",
    "this makes a total of @xmath52 bell - cats on average , or 11.55 for @xmath53 , or 5.75 for @xmath54 .",
    "the probability that our implementation of @xmath28 succeeds given that we demand it performs with a fidelity of 0.99 . here",
    "again we use @xmath49 and the worst case qubit .",
    "notice that @xmath55 , contrary to what we might expect .",
    "this occurs because when @xmath56 , @xmath57 is not an integer , and the maximum possible @xmath58 is therefore significantly lower than we can find in the @xmath53 case . ]",
    "which of these three strategies , ( i ) using very large @xmath1 , ( ii ) using only small @xmath59 , or ( iii ) operating the gate probabilistically and using gate teleportation , is ultimately most efficient is a complicated question that will depend on the constraints of bell - cat production and photon counters .",
    "we hope to address this further in future research .",
    "the other gates of the previous section can similarly be implemented by replacing the projective measurements with photon counting measurements . in this way we are able to implement a universal set of quantum gates on the coherent state qubits via linear optics , photon counting and cat and bell - cat state resources .",
    "we now examine how the cat and bell - cat states may be produced .",
    "let us now turn our attention to how small amplitude schrdinger cat states required for our universal quantum computation schemes can be realized using technologies currently available or likely in the near future .",
    "more specifically how do we generate states of the form @xmath60 . as we have seen the amplitude of these cat states",
    "need not be large ( @xmath61 is sufficient ) .",
    "an elegant proposal was made by dakna et.al@xcite ( see also @xcite ) for generating such states by means of a conditional measurement on a beam splitter .",
    "their scheme is depicted in fig ( [ fig0 ] ) and works as follows :     photons ( with @xmath62 ) on one output port of the beam - splitter prepares to a good approximation the required state . ]    a squeezed state of the form @xmath63 ( with squeezing parameter @xmath64 ) and a vacuum state @xmath65 are combined on a variable transmissivity @xmath59 beam - splitter . on the second output port from the beam - splitter a definite photon number measurement , which can be modelled by the povm @xmath66 ,",
    "is performed giving a result @xmath67 .",
    "the conditional state of the remaining output mode is then @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the mean photon number for eq.[daknacat ] is @xmath71    eq.[daknacat ] can be broken into two cases : the state resulting from an even @xmath67 result and the state from an odd @xmath67 ( which will not be considered here ) . for @xmath67 even eq.[daknacat ]",
    "has only even photon numbers and can be written in the simplified form @xmath72 for @xmath73 small , this expression can be furhter approximated as @xmath74 here we observe that as @xmath67 increases so does the population in the @xmath75 ( and higher ) states compared with the @xmath76 situation .",
    "thus for small @xmath73 the mean photon number increases as @xmath67 increases . as a cautionary note , we must emphasize that the scheme here requires the detection of an exact number of photons to generate the approximate single mode cat state .",
    "currently detectors are not that efficient but good progress is being made .    here",
    "the resulting now let us determine how good an approximation eq.[daknacat ] is with the schrdinger cat states given by eq.[eqn : cat ] .",
    "this can be achieved by calculating the overlap @xmath77 between the two states . to this end",
    "we plot in fig ( [ fig2 ] ) both the mean photon number of the state of eq.[daknacat ] and the fidelity for various even @xmath67 .     compared with eq.[eqn :",
    "cat ] and mean photon number of eq.[daknacat ] versus @xmath73 for i ) m=0 , ii ) m=2 , iii ) m=4 , iv ) m=6 , and v ) m=10 . ]",
    "it is interesting to observe that a good fidelity ( @xmath7895% ) can be achieved for quite a range of @xmath73 and @xmath67 .",
    "in fact for @xmath79 the fidelity between the two states we are comparing exceeds 99% . however to achieve a cat state with a moderate mean photon number we either need @xmath67 large or @xmath80 . as @xmath67 increases the overlap between eq.[eqn : cat ] and eq.[daknacat ] for the same mean photon number increases .",
    "there is a potential regime where eq.[daknacat ] has moderate mean photon number and a high overlap with the state eq.[eqn : cat ] .",
    "however there is a trade off in that the initial probability of generating the state eq.[daknacat ] with @xmath64 fixed decreases as @xmath67 increases .",
    "the probability of successfully generating the state eq.[daknacat ] is given by @xmath81^m \\\\",
    "\\sum_{l=0}^{\\rm int[m/2 ] }   \\frac{m!}{(m-2 l)!l!^2 ( 2 \\lambda \\cos^2 \\theta)^{2l}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and is shown in fig ( [ fig3 ] ) for various @xmath67 .     versus @xmath73 for @xmath82 with i )",
    "m=2 , ii ) m=4 , iii ) m=6 , and iv ) m=10 . ]    as @xmath67 increases the probability of successfully generating our required state significantly decreases but the success probability is reasonable for @xmath82 with either @xmath83 or @xmath84 . with such parameters we can generate a schrdinger cat like state with a fidelity greater than 95% with a probability of success greater than one percent .",
    "let us now determine if the dakna cat state can be used to generate the entangled cat state @xmath85 required in the teleportation step of the various fundamental gates .",
    "such a state can be generated from an ideal cat state but combining it with the vacuum state on a 50/50 beamsplitter ( here we need to choose the amplitude @xmath86 of the original single mode cat to be @xmath87 . using the dakna state cat as the input to this beamsplitter , we plot in figure ( [ fig5]a ) the overlap between the resulting two mode state and the two mode entangled state     and b ) the state @xmath88 resulting from the action of the gate @xmath89 with @xmath90 versus @xmath73 for i ) m=0 , ii ) m=2 and iii )",
    "]    we observe that for both @xmath91 we have the fidelity exceeding ninety five percent for a wide range of parameters .",
    "this indicates that to a very good approximation we can generate the two mode entangled cat state required for our basic gate operations .",
    "given this entangled resource we can now investigate one such gate operation .",
    "we consider the operation of the @xmath89 gate illustrated in fig ( [ fig : fid210 ] ) using the dakna cat state to generate both the entangled resource and the state @xmath92 . in fig ( [ fig5]b )",
    "we show the fidelity for performing the gate operation to transform the state @xmath92 to @xmath93 error correction ----------------",
    "a viable quantum computation scheme must be capable of incorporating error correction .",
    "we now briefly discuss the issue of error correction .",
    "the major sources of error in our scheme are expected to be , in order of increasing significance : ( i ) errors due to non orthogonal code states ; ( ii ) errors due to moving outside the qubit basis ; ( iii ) errors due to random optical phase shifts and ; ( iv ) photon loss .",
    "sources ( i ) and ( ii ) are equivalent .",
    "as discussed in section ii we could use as orthogonal code states the cat states .",
    "these states are a single qubit gate away from the coherent state code .",
    "such a gate must be non unitary and we have given a method based on teleportation to achieve this .",
    "single qubit manipulations in the cat state basis require us to move outside of the qubit basis and rely on teleportation to project back into the computational basis .",
    "we have shown that errors introduced in this process due to non orthogonality of coherent states are exponentially small in the amplitude and in any case are heralded by the teleportation process itself .",
    "if we see an error we can repeat the teleportation process which , as the errors can be made so small , is very likely to succeed after a couple of trials .",
    "we will thus not consider these sources of error further .",
    "optical phase shift errors will occur due to timing errors between different qubits and between qubits and the local oscillator .",
    "such errors may arise from path length fluctuations in the circuit .",
    "these can be monitored and corrected through classical optical interferometric techniques .",
    "such locking techniques are a mature technology and can be extremely precise",
    ". we will assume sufficient classical control is exercised to make these errors negligible .",
    "photon loss error however is a more serious problem as it is never heralded and increases quadratically with @xmath1 . in this case",
    "we must turn to error correction coding to mitigate the effect .",
    "photons are lost from a coherent state at poisson distributed times at a rate determined by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the single photon loss rate .",
    "obviously , if a photon is lost the system has one less photon .",
    "the effect of photon loss from a pure state is thus given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the bose annihilation operator .",
    "the poisson distributed nature of photon loss means that even when no photons are lost from a coherent state , the state must change .",
    "not seeing a photon emitted up to time @xmath98 indicates that the state is increasingly likely not to contain any photons at all and thus we must continuously adjust our description of the state to reflect this knowledge .",
    "we can put the description of photon loss on a more formal basis by asking for the conditional state of the system given an entire history of photon loss events .",
    "this is a list of times @xmath99 , at which photons are lost .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) conditional state is@xcite    @xmath100    the norm of this unconditional state is the probability for this history .    if we start in the coherent state @xmath101 and lose no photons up to time @xmath98 , the conditional state is @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "the important fact here is that the state remains a coherent state even though the amplitude is decreased .",
    "this kind of error takes us out of the code space , but can be corrected by teleportation .",
    "consider the state @xmath104 if we mix modes @xmath105 on a beam splitter , and count @xmath106 photons in mode 1 and @xmath107 photons in mode 2 , the conditional state of mode 3 is found to be @xmath108 . if @xmath109 is small enough this will occur with high probability .",
    "in fact letting @xmath110 the probability for this event is very close to @xmath111 the teleportation projects us back into the qubit basis with high probability as it is most likely that @xmath112 is near @xmath113 .",
    "failure of the protocol is heralded by @xmath114 and thus the gate can be repeated if necessary . the dominant term in the failure probability is approximately given @xmath115 .",
    "in fact this resetting of the amplitude happens as a matter of course in all the teleportation based gates we have discussed .",
    "thus it may not be necessary to explicitly introduce additional gates for this purpose .    if a photon is lost from a coherent state , the state is unchanged up to a phase as @xmath116 , which when normalized produces only a phase shift given by the phase of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this means that , in the qubit code space , photon loss is equivalent to an erroneous application of the @xmath14 gate , which induces a sign flip error .",
    "a sign flip error may be converted into a bit flip error by performing a hadamard gate and working in the conjugate basis @xmath117 , ( that is the cat states ) . to prepare a code state to protect sign flip errors , we thus first prepare the standard three qubit code@xcite , @xmath118 at the first beam splitter , with reflectivity amplitude of @xmath119 , modes 1 and 2 are combined , subsequently modes 2 and 3 are combined at a @xmath120 beam splitter .",
    "thus by choosing @xmath121 we can immediately prepare the entangled state @xmath122 .",
    "any logical operation may be performed on an arbitrary state in the code space @xmath123 by extending the teleportation gates for the single mode case to the multi mode case .",
    "displacements can easily be done one mode at a time .",
    "the teleportation steps in the gates will require a six mode entangled resource of the form @xmath124 such a state could be prepared by an obvious generalization of the method used in eq.([three - cat ] ) , however the amplitude of the initial cat state is becoming uncomfortably large .",
    "we now show how to avoid this problem .",
    "consider the resource state @xmath125 which can be produced from a cat state of amplitude @xmath126 by splitting it on a beamsplitter of reflectivity @xmath127 .",
    "suppose this state is used as the entanglement in a teleportation protocol with the smaller amplitude arm being mixed with the input state and measured .",
    "the result of the teleportation is the transformation @xmath128 where we have assumed the necessary bit - flip and sign - flip corrections have been made .",
    "that is , the state is amplified whilst preserving the superposition .",
    "if the amplified state is then split on a 50:50 beamsplitter an entangled state of the same amplitude as the original will be produced . by repeating this process many times multi mode encoded states or entangled resource states can be produced deterministically without the need to produce `` large '' cats .",
    "finally we note that the preceding analysis has ignored the effect of gate errors due to photon loss . for the phase rotation gate and the control phase gate",
    "( @xmath28 and @xmath129 ) the effect of photon loss is similar to that discussed above for the propagating qubit , that is it produces sign flips in the computational basis . in reaching this conclusion",
    "we have considered loss events occurring ; to the resource states ; at the measurement site and ; at the displacement .",
    "hence errors in these gates can be corrected by the code discussed above .",
    "however photon loss events in the superposition gate ( @xmath130 ) can produce bit - flips in the computational basis if they occur at the measurement site . as a result , protecting a general circuit will require error correction for both sign flips and bit flips .",
    "this can be achieved by using the standard nine - qubit code @xcite which can be implemented by a straightforward generalization of the techniques outlined in the preceding discussion .",
    "it is likely that the application of more efficient codes @xcite and optimization , in particular exploiting the rarity of bit flip versus sign flip errors in a general circuit , can reduce the complexity of the required error correcting codes .",
    "we leave an investigation of this and the general question of fault tolerance levels for future research .",
    "in this paper we have presented a quantum computation scheme based on encoding qubits as coherent states of equal absolute amplitude but opposite sign .",
    "the optical networks required to manipulate the qubits are conceptually simple and require only linear interactions and photon counting , provided coherent superposition ancilla states are available ( cat states ) . we have shown that qubits with amplitude @xmath131 and resource cat states of amplitude @xmath132 would be sufficient .",
    "accurate photon counting measurements of up to about 10 photons would also be necessary .",
    "we have discussed how the cat - state resources could be produced from squeezed sources , linear interactions and photon counting in a simple scheme .",
    "this scheme appears capable of producing states suitable for proof of principle experiments .",
    "it seems likely though that more sophisticated schemes would be necessary for scalable systems .",
    "the power of the scheme stems from the ability to generate entangled states and make bell basis measurements with simple linear interactions .",
    "this means teleportation protocols of various forms can be implemented deterministically to great effect .",
    "a disadvantage of the scheme is that the multi - photon nature of the qubits make them more susceptible to photon loss than single photon qubits .",
    "however , we have shown how error correction can be employed in a straightforward way to counter this effect .",
    "being a simple optical system , the decoherence and control issues are well understood and with sufficient effort realistic evaluations of the resources and precision needed can be made .",
    "this level of understanding is not a feature of all quantum computer candidates . as well as the long term goal of quantum computation , nearer term applications in quantum communication protocols appear possible .",
