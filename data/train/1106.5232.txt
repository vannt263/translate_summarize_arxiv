    "colloidal suspensions , small particles dispersed within a second medium , are common in everyday life with examples ranging from toothpaste to paint , from milk to quicksand @xcite .",
    "an interesting class of suspension is the electrorheological ( er ) fluid @xcite , where the liquid medium and the colloidal particles have different dielectric constants .",
    "an externally applied electric field polarizes the particles , and hence the system can be thought of as a system of dipolar particles , the moments of which are aligned along the field axis .",
    "er fluids and their phase behavior have been studied experimentally  @xcite , theoretically  @xcite and using computer simulation  @xcite . in ref",
    "@xcite , hynninen and dijkstra used mc simulation to study the phase behavior of hard and soft dipolar spheres over a broad range of packing fraction and external field strength .",
    "the morphologies they saw match those seen experimentally .",
    "what is observed both in simulation and experiment is the formation of chains of particles that in turn form sheets and body centered tetragonal ( @xmath0 ) clusters , which have been interpreted at low temperature @xmath1 to be the crystal phase coexisting with a gas .",
    "also very interesting are the experimental reports of a `` void phase '' , where at very low particle concentrations and sufficient external field strength a cell structure appears with relatively colloid rich walls forming the border between colloid poor voids . the structure has been reported both in the granular  @xcite and brownian  @xcite regimes , where it appears to be a stable structure .",
    "a similar but transient structure appears as a result of a rayleigh - taylor - like hydrodynamic instability during sedimentation  @xcite .    both the formation of @xmath0 crystallites and the void phase occur at higher external field strengths , in the regime where particles form long chains along the field axis .",
    "our goal is to gain a simpler understanding of the structures formed in the system , and so we present a simplified model in which the system is represented by well formed ( rigid ) chains of dipolar hard spheres of uniform length . in this case , the system is essentially two dimensional , with disks representing chains as viewed down the field axis .",
    "while this is perhaps not physically realistic , it should capture the essential features of the real system at high field strength , at least in terms of packing and dipolar effects .",
    "our desire to use this simplified model stems from several factors .",
    "first , we believe that the finite extent of experimental systems plays a significant role in the phase behavior seen .",
    "second , the interesting morphologies observed experimentally are seen at high fields , in the regime where the system is largely composed of chains .",
    "it would be convenient to think of these morphologies arising from interacting chains of dipolar hard spheres , but are these morphologies in fact recovered from interacting chains ? if not , what additional ingredients must be present to recover them ?    we believe that a set of chains of uniform length provide a reasonable starting point for a coarse - grained description of the experimental systems , in which this length seems to be between 50 and 100 or so spheres .",
    "we note that simply using hard rods with a uniform dipole moment density would not result in attraction between chains at short distances . once the physics of this simple system is understood , progressive detail can be added , such as the effect of chain length , chain length polydispersity ( to better simulate a sediment ) , fluctuations in chain shape etc .",
    "the main feature that emerges when reducing the system to one of chains , is that the effective interaction between chains as a function of their separation , while depending on chain length , is generally repulsive at long range and attractive at short range .",
    "this immediately suggests the possibility of clusters that are finite in size that reduce the likelihood of bulk phase separation .    the model embeds the finite extent of the system along the field axis within the chain - chain interactions .",
    "it thus provides a convenient way of approaching the bulk three dimensional limit without progressively increasing the number of particles in the simulation . in this work , as a starting point and for simplicity , we study a system of chains each composed of @xmath2 particles , motived for example by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the details of our two dimensional model and the resulting effective potential .",
    "we also discuss the energetics of clustering and provide details on our monte carlo simulations , as well as on the descriptive quantities we calculate . in section",
    "iii we present our results , and in section iv we discuss them , especially with regard to phase diagrams pertinent to our system .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions and thoughts for future work .",
    "our approach to modeling a system of colloidal particles in a uniaxial electric field begins with the assumption that the field induces point dipole moments within otherwise hard spheres of diameter @xmath3 .",
    "as the dipole moments are always aligned , the effective pair interaction becomes , @xmath4 where , @xmath5 is the energy scale of the dipolar interaction , @xmath6 is the polarization , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dielectric constants of the solution and colloids , respectively , @xmath9 is the magnitude of the local electric field with a dominant contribution from the applied external field and a negligible contribution from the field from the other induced dipoles . as shown in fig .",
    "[ dipole - angle ] , @xmath10 is the angle formed between the displacement vector between two particles and the field axis , which we choose to be along the @xmath11 aixs .    at sufficiently small reduced temperature @xmath12 ,",
    "the dipolar spheres tend to align and form chains along the field axis as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dipole - angle - long ] .",
    "thus , we will model the system as one comprising chains , each composed of @xmath13 dipolar spheres .",
    "colloids within a chain are assumed to be fixed with respect to each other , while each chain as a whole may interact with other chains .    within this approximation ,",
    "the crystal phase available to the chains is the body centred tetragonal ( @xmath0 ) structure , within which chains are either in a `` stacked '' configuration , as in fig .",
    "[ stacked - closest ] , or in a `` staggered '' configuration , as in fig .",
    "[ staggered - closest ] .",
    "while the staggered configuration is energetically preferred , and indeed is attractive at small chain axis to axis separation @xmath14 , basic geometrical frustration prevents all configurations from being staggered .    for the stacked geometry",
    ", the potential energy as a function of @xmath14 between two chains is given through eq .",
    "[ dipole - energy ] by summing all interactions between pairs of colloids in different chains , @xmath15 as shown in fig .",
    "[ stacked - simul ] , the interaction is always repulsive , increases at small @xmath14 as @xmath13 increases , but seems to become independent of @xmath13 for larger @xmath14 .    for the staggered geometry ,",
    "the interaction energy is given by , @xmath16 as shown in fig .",
    "[ staggered - simul ] , for small @xmath14 the staggered interaction is attractive , increasing in an approximately linear way with @xmath13 .",
    "while the range of attraction also grows with @xmath13 , the attractive part is short ranged with a maximum in @xmath17 at @xmath18 for @xmath19 . at larger @xmath14 ,",
    "the interaction is repulsive and quickly becomes indistinguishable from the stacked arrangement .",
    "one motivation for modeling the system in the way we do is to highlight the short range attraction and long range repulsion between the basic constituents of the system in the regime where chains are well formed .",
    "the main impact of the short range attraction and long range repulsion is the emergence of energetically favored finite size clusters .",
    "this phenomenon has been the topic of numerous studies on colloidal systems , including studies pertaining to equilibrium thermal gels .    to illustrate the effect for our system , we compose rectangular @xmath0 clusters @xmath20 chains wide and @xmath21 chains long and plot for each @xmath20 the potential energy of each cluster as a function of @xmath21 in fig .  [ physical - cluster ] .",
    "all chains in the cluster have length @xmath22 and are in contact with nearest neighbors , i.e. @xmath23 . as the figure illustrates , the potential energy for narrow clusters ( @xmath24 , 2 , 3 ) keeps decreasing with length , while for wider clusters ( @xmath25 ) , there appears an energetically favored length . for square @xmath26 clusters ( not shown ) potential energy increases beyond @xmath27 .     as a function of @xmath21.,width=264,height=181 ]    while this analysis is limited because it neglects interaction with other clusters ( i.e. , density effects ) , as well as entropic considerations , it does foreshadow the importance of long , string - like structures as well as more compact clusters of finite size .",
    "the system of interacting chains is essentially two dimensional , and as such , we represent each chain of colloidal spheres as a disk in a plane . to capture the short range structure , we label disks with either a 1 or -1 .",
    "if the product of the labels is 1 , then the interaction is given by @xmath28 , the always repulsive stacked potential .",
    "otherwise , the disks interact through @xmath29 , which is deeply attractive at short range and repulsive for distances beyond @xmath30 .",
    "we choose all chains to be composed of @xmath22 particles , and we simulate @xmath31 disks .    we follow the usual metropolis mc algorithm to generate new configurations at constant area  @xcite .",
    "to model the slight chain motion in the @xmath11 direction that can change local packing ( staggered and stacked ) , we choose between two mc moves , each with 50% probability : a random displacement of a disk , or a random displacement of a disk accompanied by a change in label of that disk .",
    "the simulations are done for a broad range of @xmath32 and area fraction @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the square simulation box length , and we report quantities for state points where the mean square displacement of the disks after an initial equilibration period is at least @xmath35 .",
    "we truncate the potentials at @xmath36 . for the largest @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "to charcterize our system , we calculate the radial distribution function @xmath39 , the structure factor @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , and the potential energy of the system @xmath42 , which includes the standard tail correction assuming @xmath43 .",
    "we aslo calculate the distribution of clusters @xmath44 , i.e. , the number of clusters of size @xmath45 .",
    "we do not consider the degree of local crystallinity in defining a cluster , but rather simply define two disks to be in the same cluster if they are within a distance of @xmath46 of each other [ @xmath47 .",
    "we do so in the spirit of toledano and coworkers  @xcite , who studied clustering in a system with competing short range attraction and long range repulsion in three dimensions , and used the appearance of a local maximum in @xmath44 for @xmath48 to define a cluster phase .",
    "this maximum is equivalently a minimum in the free energy of forming an @xmath45-sized cluster , @xmath49}$ ] .",
    "we also keep track of whether or not there is a system - spanning cluster and define the percolation line by identifying state points that have a 50% chance of containing a spanning cluster .",
    "we report the pressure in terms of @xmath39 via , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number density per unit area , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the partial radial distribution functions for stacked and staggered interactions , respectively .",
    "we have accounted for hard core repulsion , omitted the ( density dependent ) impulsive correction at @xmath54 , and have added the long range tail correction . in this way we approximate the behavior of the untruncated system .    as mentioned in the introduction , ref .",

    "<S> we perform monte carlo simulations of a simplified two - dimensional model for colloidal hard spheres in an external uniaxial ac electric field . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the external field induces dipole moments in the colloidal particles , which in turn form chains . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore approximate the system as composed of well formed chains of dipolar hard spheres of a uniform length . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar interaction between colloidal spheres gives rise to an effective interaction between the chains , which we treat as disks in a plane , that includes a short range attraction and long range repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the system favors finite clustering over bulk phase separation and indeed we observe at low temperature and density that the system does form a cluster phase . as density increases , </S>",
    "<S> percolation is accompanied by a pressure anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> the percolated phase , despite being composed of connected , locally crystalline domains , does not bear the typical signatures of a hexatic phase . at very low densities , </S>",
    "<S> we find no indication of a `` void phase '' with a cellular structure seen recently in experiments . </S>"
