    "cloud computing is a new paradigm where companies make money by providing computing service through the internet .",
    "in cloud computing , users buy software and hardware resources from a provider and access to these resources through the internet so they do not have to install and maintain by themselves .",
    "the core part of cloud computing is a data center where there are a huge number of servers .",
    "the key issue for the management of data centers is to minimize the power consumption while keeping an acceptable service level for customers  @xcite .",
    "it is reported that under the current technology an idle server still consumes about 60% of its peak processing jobs  @xcite .",
    "thus , the only way to save power is to turn off idle servers .",
    "however , if the workload increases , off servers should be turned on to serve waiting customers .",
    "servers need some setup time during which they consume energy but can not process jobs .",
    "therefore , customers have to wait a longer time in comparison with the case where the servers are always on .",
    "although queues with setup time have been extensively investigated in the literature , most of papers deal with single server models  @xcite where the service time follows a general distribution .",
    "artalejo et al .",
    "@xcite present a throughout analysis for multiserver queues with setup time where the authors consider the case in which at most one server can be in setup mode at a time .",
    "this policy is referred to as staggered setup in  @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out in  @xcite that the model belongs to a qbd class for which the rate matrix is explicitly obtainable . by solving difference equations , artalejo et al .",
    "@xcite derive an analytical solution where the stationary distribution is recursively obtained without any approximation .",
    "recently , motivated by applications in data centers , multiserver queues with setup time have been extensively investigated in the literature .",
    "in particular , gandhi et al .",
    "@xcite analyze multiserver queues with setup time .",
    "they consider the m / m/@xmath0 system with staggered setup and derive some closed form approximations for the on - off policy where the number of servers in the setup mode at a time is not limited .",

    "@xcite consider m / m/@xmath0 model with vacation where after a service an idle server leaves for an exponentially distributed vacation .",
    "in all the work on multiserver queue mentioned above , customers ( jobs ) are assumed to arrive individually according to a poisson process .",
    "however , in cloud computing a big task might be divided into multiple subtasks to process in parallel  @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to consider a multiserver queueing system with state - dependent setup time under batch arrival settings . in this paper , using a generating function approach , we derive a clear solution for all the partial generating functions for the joint stationary distribution of the number of active servers and that of customers in the system .",
    "the generating functions are obtained using recursive formulae .",
    "special cases of our model conform to the models in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we derive a recursion which allows to calculate all the moments of the queue length .",
    "numerical results are presented to show the affect of batch arrivals on the performance of the system .",
    "furthermore , we present a method to derive the waiting time distribution .",
    "we also present some variants which can be analyzed by adapting the methodologies presented in this paper .",
    "one of the most important theoretical contribution is that we prove a conditional decomposition property showing that the queue length under the conditional that all the servers are busy can be decomposed into the sum of two independent random variables with clear physical meaning .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we present the model in section  [ model : sec ] .",
    "section  [ analysis : sec ] is devoted to the detailed analysis where we derive the partial generating functions and the joint stationary distribution .",
    "section  [ waiting_time_distribution : sec ] briefly presents the method to compute the waiting time distribution while section  [ variant models ] shows some variant models that could be analyzed by the methodology of this paper . in section  [ decomposition ] , we discuss the conditional decomposition property for the queue length .",

    "[ numerical : sec ] , we provide extensive numerical results to show the performance of the system .",
    "finally , concluding remarks are presented in section  [ concluding_remark : sec ] .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> queues with setup time are extensively studied because they have application in performance evaluation of power - saving data centers . in a data center </S>",
    "<S> , there are a huge number of servers which consume a large amount of energy . in the current technology , </S>",
    "<S> an idle server still consumes about 60% of its peak processing a job . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the only way to save energy is to turn off servers which are not processing a job . </S>",
    "<S> however , when there are some waiting jobs , we have to turn on the off servers . a server needs some setup time to be active during which it consumes energy but can not process a job . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there exists a trade - off between power consumption and delay performance . </S>",
    "<S> gandhi et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite analyze this trade - off using an m / m/@xmath0 queue with staggered setup ( one server in setup at a time ) . in this paper , using an alternative approach , we obtain generating functions for the joint stationary distribution of the number of active servers and that of jobs in the system for a more general model with batch arrivals and state - dependent setup time . </S>",
    "<S> we further obtain moments for the queue size . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results reveal that keeping the same traffic intensity , the mean power consumption decreases with the mean batch size for the case of fixed batch size . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main theoretical contribution is a new conditional decomposition formula showing that the number of waiting customers under the condition that all servers are busy can be decomposed to the sum of two independent random variables where the first is the same quantity in the corresponding model without setup time while the second is the number of waiting customers before an arbitrary customer . </S>"
