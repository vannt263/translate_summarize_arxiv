    "the ensuing singular behavior of various observables are governed by a considerable degree of universality : critical exponents and amplitude ratios are broadly independent of the microscopic details of the respective systems . the emergence of scale invariance , associated thermodynamic singularities , and universality near continuous phase transitions is theoretically understood and described by the renormalization group ( rg ) , which also allows a systematic computation of critical exponents and associated scaling functions ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "can be extended to dynamical critical behavior near equilibrium , which may similarly be grouped into various dynamical universality classes .",
    "in addition to global order parameter symmetries , the absence or presence of conservation laws for the order parameter and its coupling to other slow conserved modes crucially distinguish dynamical critical properties @xcite .",

    "the additional irreversible terms cause manifest violations of the detailed - balance conditions characteristic of many - body systems in thermal equilibrium , and induce the break - down of the equilibrium einstein relations that connect the relaxation coefficients with the thermal noise strengths .",
