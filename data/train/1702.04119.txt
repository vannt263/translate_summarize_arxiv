    "simultaneous laser cooling of multiple species has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years .",
    "such mixtures are a starting point toward production of cold polar molecules  @xcite having numerous potential applications in quantum information theory  @xcite , high precision spectroscopy  @xcite and fundamental studies of new physics . in 2008",
    "it was demonstrated that ground state ultracold krb molecules can be produced by magnetoassociation followed by stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage )  @xcite and since then several other molecules such as rbcs , nak , narb have been produced employing similar techniques  @xcite .",
    "ultracold samples of molecules can also be created as a product of spontaneous decay of photoassociated ultracold atoms , with the notable example of lics molecules  @xcite .",
    "a very interesting class of molecules can be produced from alkali and closed - shell alkaline - earth(like ) atoms  @xcite .",
    "these open - shell molecules have both electric- and magnetic - dipole moments which opens up new possibilities of their control by external fields .",
    "in particular micheli et al .",
    "@xcite proposed new quantum simulators based on such molecules . there were also proposals for applications of such molecules in high - sensitivity imaging of magnetic fields  @xcite as well as high - precision measurements of electron - to - proton mass ratio  @xcite and applications in searches of limits of electric dipole moment of electron  @xcite .",
    "moreover , alkaline - earth(like ) atoms are of great importance in ultracold physics and optical metrology .",
    "they are crucial constituents of optical atomic clocks  @xcite which are the most accurate and precise scientific instruments .    since the first demonstration of two - species mot of @xmath2rb and @xmath0rb @xcite ,",
    "various different mixtures have been studied experimentally in mots , including alkali metal atoms , metastable - states systems  @xcite , highly magnetic mixtures  @xcite or three - species mots  @xcite . however , there are only few systems to date with mixtures of alkali and alkaline - earth(like ) atoms .",
    "the group of grlitz reported several studies of simultaneous trapping of rb and yb atoms in combined magnetic and optical traps @xcite , and of photoassociation spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a quantum degenerate mixture of fermionic yb with rb has been studied @xcite .",
    "another important system in which co - trapping atoms with different electronic spins was reported is the mixture of ultracold sr and rb atoms @xcite .",
    "in particular , pasquiou et al .",
    "achieved quantum degeneracy in both species . for the ybli system",
    "two groups achieved quantum degenerate state  @xcite and studies of photoassociation were performed @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that kemp et al .",
    "have recently reported a double mot setup for co - trapping the yb and cs atoms  @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "we report the first experimental system for simultaneous cooling and trapping of hg and rb atoms in the mot .",
    "rubidium has its cooling transition ( 780  nm ) at a wavelength convenient for widely available high power diode lasers .",
    "it also has a moderate temperature required to obtain vapour pressures at the level required in mots .",
    "these features make rb one of the most commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling . on the other hand",
    ", the cooling transition for mercury atoms ( 253.7  nm ) belongs to the uv - c range which is not covered by commercially available diode laser sources .",
    "nevertheless , there are several features that make mercury atoms particularly interesting .",
    "mercury has seven stable isotopes , two fermionic and five bosonic .",
    "it is regarded as the best candidate for the most accurate optical atomic clock  @xcite .",
    "this is due to its low sensitivity to black body radiation shift which is one of the fundamental limitations of the performance of the atomic clocks  @xcite . at this point , however , because of the relatively less complicated experimental set - up , i.a .",
    "thanks to required laser wavelengths , most accurate optical lattice clocks are based on strontium and ytterbium . nevertheless , to achieve best accuracy in sr and yb optical clocks a cryogenic vacuum chamber is usually required .",
    "the frequency uncertainty of the @xmath3hg optical lattice clock is presently limited by the lattice light shift @xcite .",
    "in such a clock , another advantage of mercury , i.e. high sensitivity to fine - structure constant allows finding new limits on its variation in time  @xcite , or on coupling between dark matter and standard model  @xcite . moreover , due to its very high nuclear charge , mercury is an appropriate candidate to perform fundamental experiments on parity - violation  @xcite or look for physics beyond the standard model , including cp - violating permanent electric dipole moment and cp - violating polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "in particular , meyer and bohn suggested that molecules containing mercury were good candidates for experimental searches for electric dipole moment of the electron  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us point out that the van der waals interaction of hg with other atoms is significantly weaker in comparison to sr or yb .",
    "together with other advantages mentioned above it makes molecules containing hg especially suitable for searching new kinds of interactions between barions ( hypothetical fifth force  @xcite or corrections to gravitational interactions at the nanometer scale  @xcite ) .",
    "the relatively small magnitude of the van der waals forces in these molecules will yield better constraints on such exotic forces .    in view of the above advantages",
    ", even a single - species mercury mot seems to be very interesting , yet remains challenging to produce experimentally . to date , only five groups have reported successful realization of the mercury mot @xcite .",
    "still , quantum degeneracy has not been accomplished and details of ultra cold collisions in mercury remain unknown .    in sec .",
