    "non - topological solitons in a theory of complex scalar field with global @xmath0 symmetry , proposed in @xcite and known as q - balls @xcite , are widely discussed in the literature . a simplest generalization of q - balls to the gauged case , i.e.",
    ", from the global @xmath0 symmetry to the gauge @xmath0 symmetry , is straightforward .",
    "although the existence of gauged q - balls was put in question in the well - known paper @xcite , there are some papers devoted to this subject .",
    "the most known paper is @xcite , where gauged q - balls were examined analytically and numerically ( for simplicity , from here on , we call @xmath0 gauged q - balls `` gauged q - balls '' , unless otherwise stated ) . to our knowledge , for the first time , an analysis of what is now called gauged q - balls was made in @xcite . in this remarkable paper not only were the conditions for the existence of such q - balls derived , but also the case of small coupling of the gauge field to the scalar field was discussed , the corresponding linearized equations of motion were obtained , and even an approximate solution to these equations was found .",
    "one can also recall paper @xcite , where gauged non - topological soliton solutions were obtained numerically .",
    "the scalar field part of the model of @xcite coincides with the two - fields model proposed in @xcite ; that is why the gauged non - topological soliton solution found in @xcite is not a gauged q - ball in the sense of coleman s definition of q - balls @xcite , although it is of the same kind .",
    "another interesting paper is @xcite , in which not only numerical but also approximate analytic solutions for gauged q - balls and q - shells were obtained . for a certain class of scalar field potentials and for a sufficiently weak interaction between the scalar field and the @xmath0 gauge field ,",
    "the existence of gauged q - balls was proven in @xcite in a mathematically rigorous way . a solution for a gauged q - ball in such a case of a weak coupling of the @xmath0 gauge field to the scalar field ( i.e. , an exact solution in the linear approximation above the background solution )",
    "was recently found in @xcite in the gauged version of the model proposed in @xcite ; the solution for the case in which the coupling in this model is not weak was studied in @xcite numerically .",
    "meanwhile , we think that there is a lack of understanding of the physical properties of @xmath0 gauged q - balls , so in this paper we present some results concerning both the general properties of gauged q - balls and the particular case of the small back reaction of the gauge field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the general setup and introduce the notations that will be used throughout the paper . in section  3",
    "we study the main properties of gauged q - balls ; in particular , we prove that the relation @xmath1 holds for _ any _ gauged q - ball .",
    "we also discuss different issues concerning the stability of such q - balls and show that the well - known statement about the existence of a maximal charge of stable gauged q - balls , which was made in @xcite , is incorrect . in section  4",
    "we thoroughly examine the case in which the back - reaction of the gauge field on the scalar field is small .",
    "we propose a very useful method for studying the gauged q - ball properties _ without _ solving the whole system of linearized equations of motion for the fields .",
    "the resulting compact formulas allow us to simplify the calculations considerably .",
    "we show that the small parameter of the theory does not coincide with @xmath6 in the general case ( here , @xmath7 is the coupling constant of the gauge field to the scalar field ) , which implies that the fulfillment of the condition @xmath8 does not guarantee that the linearized theory can be used for calculations .",
    "these results are illustrated by examples of two models providing , in the linear approximation in the perturbations , exact analytic solutions for gauged q - balls .",
    "we consider the action , describing the simplest @xmath0 gauge invariant four - dimensional scalar field theory , in the form @xmath9 and take the standard spherically symmetric ansatz for the fields describing a gauged q - ball : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are real functions .",
    "we suppose that the function @xmath12 has no nodes and @xmath14 .    taking into account ( [ ans1])([ans3 ] )",
    ", we can use the effective action @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( eq .  ( [ ans1 ] ) implies that @xmath18 ) , instead of ( [ action ] ) . and the corresponding volume element @xmath19 , especially in the calculations for which the spherical symmetry of the fields is not required . ] for the scalar field potential , the conditions @xmath20 are supposed to fulfill .",
    "it should be noted that gauged q - balls in theories with @xmath21 or @xmath22 do not exist ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion , following from effective action ( [ effaction ] ) , take the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "we define the charge of a gauged q - ball as @xmath25 note , that the physical charge is @xmath26 but for convenience , below we will use the charge @xmath27 defined by ( [ chargedef ] ) , not @xmath28 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for a gauged q - ball solution the sign of @xmath29 always coincides with the sign of @xmath30 . because of the symmetry @xmath31 , @xmath32 of the equations of motion , without loss of generality for simplicity we can consider @xmath33 . in this case , according to ( [ chargedef ] ) , for @xmath34 we get @xmath35 . as it was shown in @xcite , @xmath36 for @xmath37 and only a purely static solution for the scalar field can exist , so",
    "our choice @xmath38 implies @xmath39 .",
    "the energy of a gauged q - ball at rest is defined by @xmath40",
    "it is well known that for ordinary ( nongauged ) q - balls the relation @xmath1 holds .",
    "we have failed to find any note about the validity of this or an analogous relation for abelian gauged q - balls in the literature on this subject .",
    "so , below we present a simple proof of the fact that for gauged q - balls of form ( [ ans1])([ans3 ] ) in a theory described by action ( [ action ] ) the relation @xmath1 also holds .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the only parameter , which characterizes the charge and the energy for given @xmath42 and @xmath7 , is @xmath30 .",
    "thus , differentiating the energy ( [ energydef ] ) with respect to @xmath30 , we get @xmath43 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ eqg2 ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "let us use the notation @xmath44 .",
    "equation ( [ dedw ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath45 where , according to ( [ chargedef ] ) , @xmath46 .",
    "( [ eqg1 ] ) implies that @xmath47 . substituting it into eq .",
    "( [ dedw1a ] ) , we arrive at @xmath48 the integral in ( [ dedw2a ] ) is equal to zero , which can be easily seen by performing integration by parts ( since @xmath49 is assumed for gauged q - balls and consequently @xmath50 , the surface term , arising when an integration by parts is performed , obviously vanishes ) .",
    "thus , we get @xmath51 , which leads to @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "we stress that the fulfillment of ( [ dedqgauged ] ) is the general property inherent to any @xmath0 gauged q - ball . as for the points at which @xmath54 ( and , consequently , @xmath55 ) , they correspond to the cusps on the @xmath56 diagram ( like the cusps in fig .",
    "[ eq_rosen ] and fig .",
    "[ eq ] of section  4 ) , indicating the existence of a ( locally ) minimal or ( locally ) maximal charge .",
    "the cusps also separate different branches of the @xmath56 dependence .      in the absence of interactions with fermions",
    "there are three types of stability of q - balls .",
    "they are : the stability with respect to decay into free particles ( i.e. , quantum mechanical stability ) ; the stability against decay into q - balls with smaller charges ( i.e. , against fission ) and the classical stability ( the stability with respect to small perturbations of fields ) . here",
    ", we will not consider the classical stability , because in the general case its consistent study for gauged q - balls is a rather complicated task and lies beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we will consider only the quantum mechanical stability and stability against fission .",
    "we start with the stability with respect to decay into free scalar particles .",
    "suppose that there exist free particles of mass @xmath57 in the theory at hand ( all the reasonings presented below are based on the assumption that there are no extra fields except those in action ( [ action ] ) ; otherwise , the situation can be more complicated ) . in this case , the criterion for q - ball stability looks very simple , @xmath58 where @xmath56 is the energy of a q - ball with the charge @xmath27 .",
    "it is necessary to note that , as it was shown in @xcite , the inequality @xmath59 should hold for a q - ball in such a theory .",
    "indeed , the existence of free scalar particles of mass @xmath60 implies that the relevant scalar field part of the action has the form @xmath61 for small values of @xmath62 .",
    "the latter means that for any q - ball in this theory , satisfying ( [ ans1 ] ) and ( [ ans2 ] ) , inequality @xmath63 must hold ; otherwise , the corresponding solution to equation ( [ eqg2 ] ) does not fall off at infinity rapidly enough to ensure the finiteness of the q - ball charge and energy .",
    "an interesting observation is that gauged q - balls ( as well as nongauged q - balls ) can not _ emit _ free scalar particles , they can only _ decay _ into such particles . indeed , since the charge of a free particle in the theory at hand is @xmath64 , for a q - ball , we get @xmath65 where @xmath66 stands for the number of emitted particles .",
    "we see that the emission of @xmath67 free scalar particles is energetically forbidden .",
    "dependence , transitions between q - balls from different branches ( like those in fig .",
    "[ eq ] of section  4 ) with the emission of free scalar particles , or / and antiparticles and vector particles ( photons ) are not energetically forbidden in the general case .",
    "] one can easily show that an analogous emission of scalar antiparticles ( i.e. , particles with @xmath68 ) is also energetically forbidden .",
    "it this connection we would like to comment on the method of derivation of the maximal charge of stable gauged q - balls , presented in @xcite . although the corresponding estimates for the maximal charge were obtained within the particular model of @xcite , they are used in many papers concerning gauged q - balls .",
    "it is stated in @xcite that for a charge @xmath27 , such that for a q - ball of this charge the inequality @xmath69 ( in our notations ) holds , it is energetically favorable to have a q - ball with the charge @xmath70 and @xmath71 free scalar particles . the maximal charge @xmath70 is defined as a solution to equation @xmath72 . as it was shown above , for any gauged q - ball in a theory with @xmath73 the inequality @xmath74 holds , and q - balls with @xmath75 can never exist ( contrary to what was stated in @xcite ) .",
    "if any approximate solution leads to the existence of gauged q - balls with @xmath75 in a theory admitting the existence of free particles of mass @xmath60 , such an approximate solution is not valid .",
    "thus , the procedure used in @xcite for estimating the value of the maximal charge of stable gauged q - balls contradicts the main properties of gauged q - balls and can not be considered as correct , as well as the consequent statement about the existence of the maximal charge . if the condition @xmath74 is fulfilled . ]    of course , stable gauged q - balls with maximal charges may exist . as in the nongauged case",
    "( see , for example , @xcite ) , the existence of the maximal charge in the gauged case can be determined by the form of the scalar field potential or by the values of the model parameters , such a ( locally ) maximal charge corresponds to a cusp in the @xmath56 dependence .",
    "explicit examples , which will be presented in section  4 , clearly demonstrate it .",
    "meanwhile , there are many models with the charge of an absolutely stable nongauged q - ball ( classically stable , quantum mechanically stable and stable against fission ) not bound from above ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "so , we do not see any evident physical reason why it should not be so for gauged q - balls .",
    "in this connection , we would like to comment on the common belief that the coulomb repulsion makes a gauged q - ball with some large charge unstable .",
    "indeed , the repulsion due to the gauge field exists .",
    "but let us look at eq .",
    "( [ eqg1 ] ) , which can be rewritten as @xmath76 this equation implies that the gauge field inside a q - ball is effectively massive , which dilutes the strength of the repulsion considerably in comparison with the coulomb long - range repulsion .",
    "thus , although its influence on the stability of gauged q - balls can not be ignored , it should be reconsidered more accurately .",
    "now , we turn to examining the stability against fission . for ordinary ( nongauged ) q - balls the corresponding stability criterion takes the form @xmath77 if @xmath78=0 , then ( [ q - decay - crit ] ) clearly leads to @xmath79 which implies that q - ball fission is energetically forbidden .",
    "but in many models the @xmath80 branches of the @xmath56 dependence are such that there exists a minimal charge @xmath81 : @xmath82 . in this case",
    ", one can try to redefine the function @xmath56 in the region @xmath83 $ ] in order to get a continuous and differentiable auxiliary function @xmath84 : @xmath85 , @xmath84 is a monotonically increasing function for @xmath35 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "if it is possible to construct such a function @xmath84 , then inequality ( [ q - decay2 ] ) is valid for @xmath89 and , consequently , for @xmath90 .",
    "of course , such reasonings apply for gauged q - balls too .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the necessary condition for the existence of the function @xmath84 is @xmath91 .",
    "for nongauged q - balls this relation always holds because the equality @xmath92 holds for nongauged q - balls , leading to @xmath93 .    for @xmath0",
    "gauged q - balls one obtains @xcite @xmath94 this relation can be easily derived by applying the scale transformation technique of @xcite to effective action ( [ effaction ] ) , substituting the result into ( [ energydef ] ) ( to exclude @xmath42 ) and using equation of motion ( [ eqg1 ] ) .",
    "one sees that , contrary to the case of ordinary q - balls ( [ eomegaqbigger ] ) , the integral in ( [ eomegaqbigger1 ] ) is not positive - definite .",
    "thus , at this stage , we can not make any conclusion about the stability against fission for gauged q - balls with @xmath80 in the general case .",
    "of course , one may simply check that @xmath95 for a particular gauged q - ball solution .",
    "for example , if there exist free scalar particles of mass @xmath60 in the theory under consideration and the part of the @xmath56 dependence with @xmath80 , which we are interested in , starts at @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( as we will see below , it holds at least for one example that will be discussed in our paper later ; see also @xcite where this situation is realized ) , then q - balls from this branch are stable against fission .",
    "indeed , @xmath98 , the latter means that , according to @xcite , we always can construct an auxiliary function @xmath84 possessing the properties presented above .",
    "an explicit example of the function @xmath84 can be found in appendix  a.    here , we discuss another possibility .",
    "suppose we have a gauged q - ball solutions in a model with @xmath99 ( without loss of generality , we consider @xmath100 ) for the region of frequencies @xmath30 we are interested in .",
    "let us also suppose that there exist nongauged q - ball solutions in this model with @xmath101 for the same region of frequencies . in this case",
    ", one may assume that gauged q - ball solutions exist for any @xmath102 .",
    "this assumption is not obvious , and we can not justify it in a mathematically rigorous way for the general case , meanwhile , as we will see explicitly in the next section , it is valid at least when the back - reaction of the gauge field is small ( this fact was also proven in @xcite in a mathematically rigorous way for a certain class of the scalar field potentials ) . if the conditions presented above are fulfilled , then for a gauged q - ball in a theory with @xmath99 , the inequality @xmath103 holds .",
    "to show it , let us take the energy ( [ energydef ] ) and differentiate it with respect to the coupling constant @xmath7 while keeping @xmath30 fixed .",
    "performing calculations analogous to those made in ( [ dedw ] ) and ( [ dedw1a ] ) we arrive at @xmath104 eq .  ( [ eqg1 ] ) implies that @xmath105 ; substituting it into eq .",
    "( [ dede1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath106 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eqg1 ] ) into ( [ dede2 ] ) and performing integrations by parts in the resulting integral ( since @xmath49 is assumed for gauged q - balls and consequently @xmath107 , the corresponding surface term vanishes again ) , we get @xmath108 since @xmath7 is supposed to be nonnegative and @xmath109 for @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 now we integrate eq .",
    "( [ dde1 ] ) in @xmath7 from @xmath101 to @xmath99 and obtain @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 stand for the nongauged q - ball , for which @xmath115 holds for any @xmath30 , leading to @xmath116 the latter means that @xmath95 for such a gauged q - ball , which implies that , according to the reasonings presented above , the function @xmath84 can be constructed and the stability against fission for q - balls corresponding to the @xmath117 branch of the @xmath56 dependence can be established .",
    "it is clear that the gauged q - ball with @xmath117 can not decay into a q - ball from the same branch with @xmath117 and an anti - q - ball ( i.e. , a q - ball with @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) .",
    "indeed , for a gauged q - ball we have @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 , which means that such a decay is energetically forbidden .",
    "it seems that it is very difficult , or even impossible , to find a model providing an exact analytic solution for a gauged q - ball in the general case .",
    "meanwhile , if the back - reaction of the gauge field is supposed to be small ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is a nongauged q - ball solution in the case @xmath101 ) , one can try to use the linear approximation in @xmath126 and @xmath127 above the nongauged background solution , which simplifies the analysis . in this case",
    ", equations ( [ eqg1 ] ) and ( [ eqg2 ] ) can be reduced to the form @xmath128 where @xmath129 is defined as a solution to the equation @xmath130 and the condition @xmath131 is supposed to hold for any @xmath132 . to our knowledge , for the first time , the system of equations ( [ lin1 ] ) and ( [ lin2 ] ) with ( [ backgrsol ] ) was analyzed in paper @xcite , in which the coupling constant @xmath7 was assumed to be small . note that here we do not put any restrictions on the possible values of @xmath7 ; we only assume that the fields @xmath133 and @xmath134 are suppressed by the small factor proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "although this factor is proportional to @xmath135 , it does not coincide with @xmath135 in the general case .",
    "this implies that the linearized theory above the background solution @xmath129 , described by ( [ lin1 ] ) and ( [ lin2 ] ) , can not be used when only @xmath8 holds  the fields @xmath133 and @xmath134 should also remain small compared to @xmath30 and @xmath129 respectively .",
    "we will discuss this issue in detail later ; see also a simple justification of this fact in appendix  b.      linearizing the charge ( [ chargedef ] ) and the energy ( [ energydef ] ) with respect to the background solution @xmath136 , performing integration by parts and using the linearized equations of motion , we arrive at @xmath137 @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are defined by eqs .",

    "let us take equation ( [ backgrsol ] ) and differentiate it with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "we get @xmath143 now we take equation ( [ lin2 ] ) , multiply it by @xmath144 , integrate over the spatial volume and perform integration by parts in the term containing @xmath145 .",
    "we get @xmath146 substituting ( [ backgrsol2 ] ) into ( [ integralpert ] ) , we arrive at @xmath147 now , let us consider the charge ( [ charge ] ) . according to ( [ integralpert2 ] ) @xmath148 where @xmath149 is defined as @xmath150 .",
    "the last integral can be transformed as @xmath151 where we have used ( [ lin1 ] ) and the relation @xmath152 , which follows from ( [ lin1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we get @xmath153 let us define @xmath154 then , from ( [ charge2 ] ) and ( [ forcharge2 ] ) , we get @xmath155 now it is easy to show that @xmath156 with the help of ( [ lin1 ] ) the integral @xmath157 can be expressed in the form @xmath158 which is nothing but the energy of the gauge field taken with the minus sign ( see ( [ energydef ] ) ) .    relations ( [ chargei ] ) and ( [ energyi ] ) allow us to check explicitly the validity of ( [ dedqgauged ] ) in the linearized theory .",
    "indeed , @xmath159    now , we turn to the calculation of the integral @xmath157 .",
    "first , we take equation ( [ lin1 ] ) .",
    "given a background solution @xmath129 , the spherically symmetric solution to ( [ lin1 ] ) such that @xmath160 , @xmath161 takes the form @xcite @xmath162 substituting it into ( [ idef ] ) , we get @xmath163 by performing integration by parts , it is easy to show that @xmath164 thus , we arrive at @xmath165 where we have used @xmath150 . equivalently , ( [ ifinal ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath166    from ( [ chargei ] ) , ( [ energyi ] ) and ( [ ifinal ] ) we see that the charge and the energy of a gauged q - ball through the terms linear in @xmath135 can be calculated using only the background solution @xmath129 for the nongauged q - ball .",

    "this explicit example confirms that in order to check the validity of the linear approximation in the general case ( in which the dependence of these parameters on @xmath30 is very complicated or can not be obtained analytically ) , it is better to estimate all the parameters @xmath179 , @xmath351 , and @xmath342 or to calculate the function @xmath352 , defined by ( [ expparam ] ) , which is presented in fig .",

    "[ gtoomega ] and fig .",
    "[ alphafig ] demonstrate that , although the use of parameters like @xmath323 as @xmath30-independent small parameters can be convenient for calculations and for rough estimates , they can not replace the natural small parameters @xmath215 in the general case .    of course , the smaller @xmath323 is , the wider the region ( or regions ) of frequencies @xmath30 , in which the linear approximation works , is .",
    "meanwhile , the chosen set of the parameters , for which fig .",
    "[ gtoomega ] and fig .",
    "[ alphafig ] were plotted , is very useful for illustrative purposes .",
    "based on these reasons , as well as to make the differences between the gauged and nongauged cases visible by the naked eye , we keep fig .",
    "[ eq ] as it is , although , according to fig .",
    "[ alphafig ] , the linear approximation works well enough only in the vicinity of @xmath353 for @xmath322 .",
    "now , let us turn to the discussion of stability of gauged q - balls in this model .",
    "we will focus on the lowest branch in fig .",
    "[ eq ] , for which @xmath354 . the results of section  3 imply that q - balls from the lowest branch are stable against fission .",
    "we also see that the part of this lowest branch lies below the line @xmath355 standing for free scalar particles of mass @xmath60 .",
    "this means that , at least in the absence of fermions , q - balls from this part of the branch are stable with respect to decay into free particles .",
    "the last type of stability , which could be discussed here , is the classical stability . of course",
    ", we may wonder that the main properties of gauged and nongauged q - balls are similar at least in the case in which the parameter @xmath215 is rather small .",
    "so , if we suppose that the classical stability criterion for ordinary q - balls @xcite , which states that q - balls for which @xmath356 ( for @xmath35 , @xmath34 ) holds are classically stable , is valid for gauged q - balls , then the gauged q - balls from the lowest branch are also classically stable . in such a case , the part of the lowest branch , which lies below the line @xmath355 , consists of absolutely stable q - balls .",
    "but we can not justify that the classical stability criterion for ordinary q - balls works for gauged q - balls too , so we consider the q - balls from the part of the lowest branch , which lies below the @xmath355 line , as stable against fission and against decay into free scalar particles only . according to fig .",
    "[ eq ] , for the given values of the model parameters ( @xmath327 , @xmath328 , @xmath322 ) , such q - balls have charges in the range @xmath357 and energies in the range @xmath358 .    as for the previous model , for completeness below we present an explicit solution for the fields @xmath133 and @xmath134 in this model .",
    "the solution for the field @xmath133 can be obtained directly from ( [ rosensol ] ) with ( [ backsol1 ] ) and ( [ backsol2 ] ) , whereas solution for the field @xmath134 was obtained by means of the method of variation of parameters .",
    "we present it for the simplest case @xmath359 .",
    "this solution , satisfying @xmath161 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and the nonstandard matching conditions at @xmath360 ( because @xmath361 ) , has the form for the gauge field @xmath362 where @xmath363 @xmath364 and for the scalar field @xmath365 where @xmath366 @xmath367 @xmath368 we see that , even for the very simple background solution ( [ backsol1 ] ) , ( [ backsol2 ] ) , the solution for @xmath133 and @xmath134 appears to be complicated .",
    "contrary to the case of model  1 , the solution ( [ linsolbegin])([linsolend ] ) can not be factorized .",
    "it should be mentioned that the double integrals in ( [ linsolbegin])([linsolend ] ) ( the functions @xmath369 and @xmath370 have integral representations themselves ) in principle can be transformed to the form containing only integrals of one variable by performing integration by parts ( corresponding calculations are straightforward , though rather tedious ) ; this is possible only because of the simplicity of the background solution ( [ backsol1 ] ) , ( [ backsol2 ] ) .",

    "]     ( left plot ) and @xmath371 ( right plot ) . here , @xmath359 and @xmath373 .",
    "]    the plots of this solution for the fields @xmath133 and @xmath134 are presented in figs .",
    "[ sol1 ]  and  [ sol2 ] .",
    "one can see the breaks on the curves corresponding to the field @xmath134 .",
    "this is an artefact of linearization in the theory with potential ( [ potential2 ] ) , which also contains a break ( recall that @xmath361 ) .",
    "of course , the break in potential ( [ potential2 ] ) can be regularized , leading to the smooth behavior of @xmath134 at @xmath360 .",
    "one also sees that for different values of @xmath276 solutions for the field @xmath134 have different form : in the first case , @xmath134 increases at small @xmath132 , whereas in the second case , it decreases at small @xmath132 starting from @xmath374 .",
    "it should be noted that , contrary to what we have in model  1 ( see ( [ fvarphi ] ) ) , in both cases , the solution for the field @xmath134 crosses the axis @xmath375 and then tends to zero from below .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ sol2 ] ; as for the case presented in fig .",
    "[ sol1 ] , the solution crosses the axis @xmath375 at @xmath376 , which is out of range of the presented plot .",
    "solutions for other values of the model parameters have the form similar either to the solution presented in fig .  [ sol1 ] or to the solution presented in fig .  [ sol2 ] .",
    "finally , we would like to note that , as it can be checked explicitly , the relation @xmath180 grows logarithmically with @xmath132 in this model ( see also appendix  c ) .",
    "but , again , this growth is very slow relative to the exponential fall of @xmath129 and @xmath134 , and , analogously to the previous case , this confirms that with an appropriate choice of the model parameters ( including @xmath30 ) and with @xmath320 the use of the linear approximation is fully justified .",
    "in the present paper , we studied some general properties of @xmath0 gauged q - balls .",
    "in particular , we showed that , as in the case of ordinary nongauged q - balls , the relation @xmath1 also holds for @xmath0 gauged q - balls .",
    "based on this result and using the fact that @xmath63 in theories admitting the existence of free scalar particles of mass @xmath60 , we demonstrated that the statement about the existence of the maximal charge of stable gauged q - balls , presented in @xcite , was obtained by means of the erroneous inequality @xmath75 and thus can not be considered as correct .",
    "we also presented a powerful method for analyzing gauged q - balls in the case in which the back - reaction of the gauge field on the scalar field is small .",
    "provided a nongauged ( background ) q - ball solution @xmath170 , for a given value of the coupling constant @xmath7 , the strength of the back - reaction of the gauge field can be estimated by calculating the parameter @xmath215 defined by ( [ expparam ] ) , which depends on @xmath30 and the background solution @xmath170 only .",
    "this parameter is proportional to @xmath6 in general but does not coincide with it .",
    "we have shown that our results can be used not if only the inequality @xmath8 holds but if the overall parameter @xmath215 is also rather small to ensure the validity of the linear approximation ( in principle , the smallness of @xmath215 does not exclude the cases in which @xmath7 is not small ) .",
    "the main parameters of gauged q - balls in such a theory  the charge and the energy  can also be calculated using the background solution @xmath170 only ( using eqs .",
    "( [ mainresultlin0 ] ) , ( [ mainresultlin ] ) or the even simpler eq .",
    "( [ ege0-main ] ) ) , whereas an explicit solution to the system of linearized equations of motion is not necessary at all .",
    "the obtained results were illustrated by the examples of two exactly solvable models proving the efficiency of the proposed method  indeed , even for the very simple background solution ( [ backsol1 ] ) , ( [ backsol2 ] ) , the explicit analytic solution for gauged q - ball ( [ linsolbegin])([linsolend ] ) , which was obtained in the linear approximation in @xmath134 and @xmath133 , appears to be rather complicated and its derivation ( at least for the field @xmath134 ) is more bulky than the analytical evaluation of integral ( [ ifinal ] ) for ( [ backsol1 ] ) and ( [ backsol2 ] ) . without ( [ mainresultlin0])([mainresultlin1 ] ) or ( [ ege0-main ] ) ,",
    "evaluation of ( [ charge ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) does not seem to be a simple task , taking into account the necessity to solve numerically ( in the general case ) the differential equation ( [ lin2 ] ) to get a solution for the field @xmath134 . obviously , it is a much more complicated task than the evaluation of the double integral in ( [ ifinal ] ) , even with a background nongauged solution @xmath170 obtained numerically .",
