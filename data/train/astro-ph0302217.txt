    "the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ mission was designed to measure the cmb anisotropy with unprecedented precision and accuracy on angular scales from the full sky to several arc minutes by producing maps at five frequencies from 23 to 94 ghz .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "satellite mission @xcite employs a matched pair of 1.4 m telescopes @xcite observing two areas on the sky separated by @xmath0141 .",
    "a differential radiometer @xcite with a total of 10 feeds for each of the two sets of optics @xcite measures the difference in sky brightness between the two sky pixels .",
    "the satellite is deployed at the earth - sun lagrange point , @xmath9 , and observes the sky with a compound spin and precession that covers the full sky every six months .",
    "the differential data are processed on the ground to produce full sky maps of the cmb anisotropy @xcite .",
    "full sky maps provide the smallest record of the cmb anisotropy without loss of information .",
    "they permit a wide variety of statistics to be computed from the data  one of the most fundamental is the angular power spectrum of the cmb . indeed ,",
    "if the temperature fluctuations are gaussian , with random phase , then the angular power spectrum provides a _ complete _ description of the statistical properties of the cmb .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the first - year _ wmap _  sky maps to search for evidence of non - gaussianity and find none , aside from a modest level of point source contamination which we account for in this paper .",
    "thus , the measured power spectrum may be compared to predictions of cosmological models to develop constraints on model parameters .",
    "this paper presents the angular power spectrum obtained from the first - year _ wmap _  sky maps .",
    "companion papers present the maps and an overview of the basic results @xcite , and describe the foreground removal process that precedes the power spectrum analysis @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite discuss the implications of the _ wmap _  power spectrum for cosmological parameters and carry out a joint analysis of the _ wmap _  spectrum together with other cmb data and data from large - scale structure probes .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite discuss the data processing , the radiometer performance , the instrument beam characteristics and the spacecraft in - orbit performance , respectively .",
    "a sky map @xmath10 defined over the full sky can be decomposed in spherical harmonics @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a unit direction vector , and @xmath14 are the spherical harmonic functions evaluated in the direction @xmath13 .",
    "if the cmb temperature fluctuation @xmath15 is gaussian distributed , then each @xmath16 is an independent gaussian deviate with @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ensemble average power spectrum predicted by models , and @xmath20 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "the actual power spectrum realized in our sky is @xmath21 in the absence of noise , and with full sky coverage , the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : sum_alm_full ] ) provides an unbiased estimate of the underlying theoretical power spectrum , which is limited only by cosmic variance .",
    "however , realistic cmb anisotropy measurements contain noise and other sources of error that cause the quadratic estimator in equation  ( [ eq : sum_alm_full ] ) to be biased .",
    "in addition , while _ wmap_measures the anisotropy over the full sky , the data near the galactic plane are sufficiently contaminated by foreground emission that only a portion of the sky ( @xmath085% ) can be used for cmb power spectrum estimation .",
    "thus , the integral in equation  ( [ eq : int_alm_full ] ) can not be evaluated as such , and other methods must be found to estimate @xmath19 .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : ps_estimation ] , we review two methods that have appeared in the literature for estimating the angular power spectrum in the presence of instrument noise and sky cuts . the first @xcite is a quadratic estimator that evaluates equation  ( [ eq : int_alm_full ] ) on the _ cut _ sky yielding a `` pseudo power spectrum '' @xmath22 .",
    "the ensemble average of this quantity is related to the true power spectrum , @xmath19 by means of a mode coupling matrix @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the second method @xcite uses a maximum likelihood approach optimized for fast evaluation with _ wmap_-like data . in appendix",
    "[ sec : ps_estimation ] we demonstrate that the two methods produce consistent results .    a quadratic estimator offers the possibility of computing both an `` auto - power '' spectrum , proportional to @xmath24 , and a `` cross - power '' spectrum , proportional to @xmath25 , where the @xmath26 coefficients are estimated from two independent cmb maps , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this latter form has the advantage that , if the noise in the two maps is uncorrelated , the quadratic estimator is not biased by the noise . for all cosmological analyses ,",
    "we use only the cross - power spectra between statistically independent channels . as a result ,",
    "the angular spectra are , for all intents and purposes , independent of the noise properties of an individual radiometer .",
    "this is analogous to interferometric data which exhibits a high degree of immunity to systematic errors .",
    "the precise form of the estimator we use is given in appendix  [ sec : ps_estimation ] .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : instrument ] we review the properties of the _ wmap _  instrument and how they affect the derived power spectrum . in ",
    "[ sec : data ] we present results for the angular power spectra obtained from individual pairs of radiometers , the cross - power spectra , and examine numerous consistency tests . in  [ sec : covariance ] , in preparation for generating a final combined power spectrum , we present the full covariance matrix of the cross - power spectra . in  [ sec : combined ] we present the methodology used to produce the final combined power spectrum and its covariance matrix . in  [ sec : discuss ] we compare the _ wmap _  first - year power spectrum to a compilation of previous cmb measurements and to a prediction based on a combination of previous cmb data and the 2dfgrs data .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : conclude ] and outline the power spectrum data products being made available through the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) .",
    "appendix  [ sec : ps_estimation ] reviews two methods used to estimate the angular power spectrum from cmb maps .",
    "appendix  [ sec : marginalize ] describes how we account for point source contamination .",
    "appendix  [ sec : power_opt ] presents our approach to combining multi - channel data .",
    "appendix  [ sec : fisher ] describes how the foreground mask correlates multipole moments in the fisher matrix , and appendix  [ sec : wigner ] collects some useful properties of the spherical harmonics .",
    "the _ wmap _  instrument is composed of 10 `` differencing assemblies '' ( das ) spanning 5 frequencies from 23 to 94 ghz @xcite .",
    "the 2 lowest frequency bands ( k and ka ) are primarily galactic foreground monitors , while the 3 highest ( q , v , and w ) are primarily cosmological bands .",
    "there are 8 high frequency differencing assemblies : q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 , and w1 through w4 .",
    "each da is formed from two differential radiometers which are sensitive to orthogonal linear polarization modes ; the radiometers are designated 1 or 2 ( e.g. , v11 or w12 ) depending on which polarization mode is being sensed .    the temperature measured on the sky",
    "is modified by the properties of the instrument .",
    "the most important properties that affect the angular power spectrum are finite resolution and instrument noise .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the auto or cross - power spectrum evaluated from two sky maps , @xmath27 and @xmath30 , where @xmath27 is a da index .",
    "further , define the shorthand @xmath31 to denote a pair of indices , e.g. , ( q1,v2 ) .",
    "this spectrum will have the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the window function that describes the combined smoothing effects of the beam and the finite sky map pixel size . here",
    "@xmath34 is the beam transfer function for da @xmath27 , given by @xcite [ note that they reserve the term `` beam window function '' for @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the pixel transfer function supplied with the healpix package @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 is the noise spectrum realized in this particular measurement . on average ,",
    "the observed spectrum estimates the underlying power spectrum , @xmath19 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average noise power spectrum for differencing assembly @xmath27 , and the kronecker symbol indicates that the noise is uncorrelated between differencing assemblies . to estimate the underlying power spectrum on the sky , @xmath19 ,",
    "the effects of the noise bias and beam convolution must be removed .",
    "the determination of transfer functions and noise properties are thus critical components of any cmb experiment .    in  [ sec :",
    "window_functions ] we summarize the results of @xcite on the _ wmap _  window functions and their uncertainties .",
    "we propagate these uncertainties through to the final fisher matrix for the angular power spectrum . in  [ sec : inst_noise ] we present a model of the _ wmap _  noise properties appropriate to power spectrum evaluation . for cross power spectra ( @xmath40 above )",
    ", the noise bias term drops out of equation  ( [ eq : cl_obs_bias ] ) if the noise between the two das is uncorrelated .",
    "these cross - power spectra provide a nearly optimal estimate of the true power spectrum , essentially independent of errors in the noise model , thus we use them exclusively in our final power spectrum estimate .",
    "the noise model is primarily used to propagate noise errors through the analysis , and to test a variety of different power spectrum estimates for consistency with the combined cross - power spectrum .      as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the instrument beam response was mapped in flight using observations of the planet jupiter . the signal to",
    "noise ratio is such that the response , relative to the peak of the beam , is measured to approximately @xmath41 db in w band , the band with the highest angular resolution .",
    "the beam widths , measured in flight , range from @xmath42 at k band down to @xmath43 in some of the w band channels ( fwhm ) .",
    "maps of the full two - dimensional beam response are presented in @xcite , and are available with the _ wmap _  first - year data release .",
    "the radial beam profiles obtained from these maps have been fit to a model consisting of a sum of hermite polynomials that accurately characterize the main gaussian lobe and small deviations from it .",
    "the model profiles are then legendre transformed to obtain the beam transfer functions @xmath34 for each da @xmath27 .",
    "full details of this procedure are presented in @xcite , and the resulting transfer functions are also provided in the first - year data release .",
    "we have chosen to normalize the transfer function to 1 at @xmath44 because _ wmap _   calibrates its intensity response using the modulation of the cmb dipole ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this effectively partitions calibration uncertainty from window function uncertainties .",
    "the beam processing described above provides a straightforward means of propagating the noise uncertainty directly from the time - ordered data through to the final transfer functions .",
    "the result is the covariance matrix @xmath46 for the normalized transfer function .",
    "plots of the diagonal elements of @xmath46 are presented in @xcite .",
    "the fractional error in the transfer functions @xmath34 are typically 1 - 2% in amplitude . in the end , these window function uncertainties dominate the small off - diagonal elements of the final covariance matrix for the combined power spectrum ( see  [ sec : covariance ] ) .",
    "additional observations of jupiter will reduce these uncertainties .",
    "an additional source of error in our treatment of the beam response arises from non - circularity of the main beam .",
    "the effects of this non - circularity are mitigated by _",
    "s scan strategy which results in most sky pixels being observed over a wide range of azimuth angles . the effective beam response on the sky is thus largely symmetrized .",
    "we estimate that the effects of imperfect symmetrization produce window function errors of @xmath47% relative to a perfectly symmetrized beam window function @xcite .",
    "this error is well within the formal uncertainty given in @xmath46 . in  [ sec : combined ] we infer the optimal power spectrum by combining the 28 cross - power spectra measured by the 8 high frequency das q1 through w4 . as part of this process",
    "we marginalize over the window function uncertainty , which automatically propagates these errors into the final covariance matrix for the combined power spectrum .",
    "both the combined power spectrum and the corresponding fisher matrix are part of the first - year data release .",
    "the noise bias term in equation  ( [ eq : cl_obs_bias ] ) is the noise per @xmath26 mode on the sky .",
    "if auto - power spectra are used in the final power spectrum estimate , the noise bias term must be known very accurately because it exponentially dominates the convolved power spectrum at high @xmath48 .",
    "if only cross correlations are used , the noise bias is only required for propagating errors .",
    "our final best spectrum is based only on cross correlations , and is independent of this term .",
    "however , as an independent check of our results , we evaluate the maximum likelihood spectrum based on a combined q+v+w sky map . the noise bias must be estimated accurately for this application .    in the limit that the time - ordered instrument noise is white ,",
    "the noise bias is a constant , independent of @xmath48 .",
    "if the time - ordered noise has a @xmath49 component , the bias term will rise at low @xmath48 . in this subsection",
    "we estimate the noise bias properties for each of the high frequency _ wmap _  radiometers based on the time - ordered noise properties presented in @xcite . while the _ wmap _  radiometer noise is nearly white by design @xcite with @xmath49 knee frequencies of less than 10 mhz for 9 out of 10 differencing assemblies , one of the radiometers ( w41 ) has a @xmath49 knee frequency of @xmath045 mhz .",
    "the latter is large enough that the deviations of @xmath39 from a constant must be accounted for .",
    "the most reliable way to estimate the effects of @xmath49 noise on the measured power spectra is by monte carlo simulation . using the pipeline simulator discussed in @xcite we have generated a library of noise maps with flight - like properties .",
    "specifically we have included flight - like @xmath49 noise in the simulated time - ordered data , and have run each full - year realization through the map - making pipeline , including the baseline pre - whitening discussed in @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the power spectra of these maps using the quadratic estimator described in appendix  [ sec : ps_estimation ] with 3 different pixel weighting schemes .",
    "( see appendix  [ sec : weights ] for definitions of the weights , and the @xmath48 range in which each is used . )",
    "we define the effective noise as a function of @xmath48 based on fits to these monte carlo noise spectra . for the analyses in this paper ,",
    "we fit the spectra to a model of the form @xmath50^{-1 } \\label{eq : noise_fit}\\ ] ] where the @xmath51 are fit coefficients given in table  [ tab : noise_fit ] , with @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath55 .    figure  [ fig : noise_spec ] shows the noise spectrum derived from the simulations for each of the 8 high frequency das , using uniform weighting over the entire @xmath48 range . for comparison , we also plot an estimate of the cmb power spectrum from  [ sec : combined ] in grey . note that the w4 spectrum is the only one of this set to exhibit deviations from white noise in an @xmath48 range where the signal - to - noise is relatively low , and we believe this simulation slightly over - estimates the @xmath49 noise in the flight w4 differencing assembly @xcite .",
    "@xcite present limits on systematic errors in the first - year sky maps .",
    "they consider the effects of absolute and relative calibration errors , artifacts induced by environmental disturbances ( thermal and electrical ) , errors from the map - making process , pointing errors , and other miscellaneous effects .",
    "the combined errors due to relative calibration errors , environmental effects , and map - making errors are limited to @xmath56 @xmath1k@xmath2 ( @xmath57 ) in the quadrupole moment @xmath58 in any of the 8 high - frequency das .",
    "tighter limits are placed on higher - order moments .",
    "we conservatively estimate the absolute calibration uncertainty in the first - year _ wmap _  data to be 0.5% .",
    "random pointing errors are accounted for in the beam mapping procedure ; the beam transfer functions presented by @xcite incorporate random pointing errors automatically .",
    "a systematic pointing error of @xmath010at the spin period is suspected in the quaternion solution that defines the spacecraft pointing .",
    "this is much smaller than the smallest beam width ( @xmath012at w band ) , and we estimate that it would produce @xmath591% error in the angular power spectrum at @xmath4 , thus we do not attempt to correct for this effect .",
    "@xcite place limits on spurious contributions due to stray light pickup through the far sidelobes of the instrument .",
    "they place limits of @xmath5910 @xmath1k@xmath2 on spurious contributions to @xmath19 , at q through w band , due to far sidelobe pickup .    a detailed model of galactic foreground emission based on the first - year _ wmap_data is presented by @xcite and is summarized in  [ sec : foregrounds ] .",
    "we show that diffuse foreground emission is a modest source of contamination at large angular scales ( @xmath602 ) . _ systematic errors on these angular scales are negligible compared to the ( modest ) level of foreground emission . _ on smaller angular scale ( @xmath612 ) , the 1 - 3% uncertainty in the individual beam transfer functions is the largest source of uncertainty , while for multipole moments greater than @xmath0600 , random white noise from the instrument is the largest source of uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross_power_raw ] shows the cross - power spectra obtained from all 28 combinations of the 8 differencing assemblies q1 through w4 using the quadratic estimator described in appendix  [ sec : quad_estimation ] .",
    "these spectra have been evaluated with the kp2 sky cut described in @xcite .",
    "the spectra are color coded by effective frequency , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the frequency of differencing assembly @xmath27 .",
    "the low frequency ( 41 ghz ) data are shown in red , the high frequency ( 94 ghz ) data in blue , with intermediate frequencies following the colors of the rainbow .",

    "the top panel shows a very robust measurement of the first acoustic peak with a maximum near @xmath65 and a shape that is consistent with the predictions of adiabatic fluctuation models .",
    "there is also a clear indication of the rise to a second peak at @xmath7 .",
    "see @xcite for an analysis and discussion of the peaks and troughs in the first - year _ wmap _  power spectrum .",
    "the red data in the top panel show very clearly that the low frequency data are contaminated by diffuse galactic emission at low @xmath48 and by point sources at higher @xmath48 .",
    "the higher frequency data show less apparent contamination , consistent with the foreground emission being dominated by radio emission , rather than thermal dust emission , as expected in this frequency range .",
    "@xcite present a detailed model of the galactic foreground emission based on a maximum entropy analysis of all 5 _ wmap _  frequency bands , in combination with external tracer templates .",
    "they demonstrate that the emission is well modeled by three distinct emission components .",
    "1 ) synchrotron emission from cosmic ray electrons , with a steeply falling spectrum in the _ wmap _  frequency range : @xmath66 with @xmath67 , steepening with increasing frequency .",
    "2 ) free - free emission from the ionized interstellar medium that is well traced by h@xmath68 emission in regions where the dust extinction is low .",
    "3 ) thermal emission from interstellar dust grains with an emissivity index @xmath69 .",
    "the model has a galactic signal minimum between v and w band .    in principal",
    "we could subtract the above model from each _ wmap _  channel and recompute the power spectrum .",
    "however , since the model is based on _ wmap _  data that have been smoothed to an angular resolution of @xmath70 , the resulting maps would have complicated noise properties . for the purposes of power spectrum analysis",
    ", we adopt a more straightforward approach based on fitting foreground tracer templates to the q , v , and w band data .",
    "the details of this procedure , the resulting fit coefficients , and a comparison of the fits to the maximum entropy model are given in @xcite .",
    "they estimate that the template model removes @xmath085% of the foreground emission in q , v , and w bands and that the remaining emission constitutes less than @xmath02% of the cmb variance ( up to @xmath71 ) in q band , and @xmath611% of the cmb variance in v and w bands .",
    "the contribution from extragalactic radio sources has been analyzed in three separate ways .",
    "@xcite directly fit for sources in the sky maps .",
    "the result of this analysis is that we have identified 208 sources in the _ wmap _  data with sufficient signal to noise ratio to pass the detection criterion ( we estimate that @xmath05 of these are likely to be spurious ) .",
    "the derived source count law is consistent with the following model for the power spectrum of the unresolved sources @xmath72 with @xmath73 @xmath1k@xmath2 sr ( measured in thermodynamic temperature ) , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ghz .",
    "@xcite evaluate the bispectrum of the _ wmap _  data and are able to fit a non - gaussian source component based on a particular configuration of the bispectrum .",
    "they find the same source model , equation  ( [ eq : source_model ] ) , fits the bispectrum data .",
    "for the remainder of this section , we adopt this model for correcting the cross - power spectra . at q band ( 41 ghz )",
    "the correction to @xmath76 is 868 and 3468 @xmath1k@xmath2 at @xmath48=500 and 1000 , respectively . at w band ( 94 ghz ) ,",
    "the correction is only 31 and 126 @xmath1k@xmath2 at the same @xmath48 values . for comparison ,",
    "the cmb power in this @xmath48 range is @xmath0 2000 @xmath1k@xmath2 .",
    "later , when we derive a final combined spectrum from the multi - frequency data , we adopt equation  ( [ eq : source_model ] ) as a model with @xmath77 as a free parameter .",
    "we simultaneously fit for a combined cmb spectrum and source amplitude and marginalize over the residual uncertainty in a. the best - fit source amplitude from this process is consistent with the other two methods .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross_power_corr ] shows the cross - power spectra obtained from the same 28 combinations as in figure  [ fig : cross_power_raw ] , this time with the galactic template model and source model subtracted .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure shows the ratio of the 28 channels to the combined spectrum obtained in  [ sec : combined ] .",
    "the 28 cross - power spectra are consistent with each other at the 5 to 20% level over the @xmath48 range 2  500 .",
    "similar scatter is seen in monte carlo simulations of an ensemble of 28 cross - power spectra with _ wmap _ s beam and noise properties .",
    "the only significant deviation lies in the q band data at low @xmath48 which is @xmath010% below the higher frequency bands at @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with the accuracy estimated above for the galactic template model , see also figure 11 of @xcite for images of the maps after galactic template subtraction .",
    "since the _ wmap _  data are not noise limited at low @xmath48 , we use only v and w band data in the final combined spectrum for @xmath79 .",
    "the subtraction of the source model , equation  ( [ eq : source_model ] ) , brings the q band spectrum into good agreement with the other cross - power spectra up to @xmath80 . at higher @xmath48 ,",
    "the q band data contributes very little to the final combined spectrum because the ( normalized ) q band window function has dropped to less than 5% @xcite . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : combined ] , we marginalize over the source amplitude uncertainty , @xmath81 , when obtaining the final power spectrum estimate and associated covariance matrix . thus the uncertainty is also accounted for in subsequent cosmological parameter fits @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross_power_corr_100 ] shows a close - up of the 28 cross - power spectra in figure  [ fig : cross_power_corr ] up to @xmath82 .",
    "the top panel shows the raw ( unbinned ) data which has correlations of @xmath592% between neighboring points is this @xmath48 range ( see  [ sec : covariance ] ) .",
    "these data are strikingly consistent with each other and support the conclusion that systematic errors at low @xmath48 are insignificant . to assess the level of scatter that does exist between the spectra , we have generated a monte carlo simulation in which we compute the rms scatter among the 28 spectra at each @xmath48 , relative to the measured power .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : cross_power_corr_100 ] shows the results of this simulation , averaged over 1000 realizations , compared to the relative rms scatter in the data .",
    "the agreement is excellent , indicating that the uncertainty in the measured power spectrum in this @xmath48 range is a few percent and is consistent with a combination of instrument noise and mode coupling due to the 15% sky cut .",
    "another striking feature is the low amplitude of the observed quadrupole , and the sharp rise in power , almost linear in @xmath48 , to @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite quote a value for the rms quadrupole amplitude , @xmath84 @xmath1k , where the uncertainty is largely due to galactic model uncertainty .",
    "this is consistent with the amplitude measured by the _ cobe - dmr _ experiment , @xmath85 @xmath1k @xcite .",
    "the fast , nearly linear rise to @xmath83 produces an angular correlation function with essentially no power on angular scales @xmath6060 , again in excellent agreement with the _ cobe - dmr _ correlation function @xcite . in the context of a standard @xmath86cdm model ,",
    "the probability of observing this little power on scales greater than 60  is @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "in  [ sec : combined ] we derive our best estimate of the angular power spectrum by optimally combining the 28 cross - power spectra discussed above . the procedure for combining spectra",
    "requires the full covariance matrix of the individual cross - power spectra  in this section we outline the salient features of this matrix .",
    "there are six principal sources of variance for the measured spectra , @xmath88 : cosmic variance , instrument noise , mode coupling due to the foreground mask , point source subtraction errors , uncertainty in the beam window functions , and an overall calibration uncertainty .",
    "we ignore uncertainties in the diffuse foreground correction since they are everywhere sub - dominant to the cosmic variance uncertainty ( see  [ sec : foregrounds ] ) .",
    "we may write the covariance matrix as @xmath89    [ c^{\\bf j}_{l ' } - ( c_{l ' } + as^{\\bf j})w^{\\bf j}_{l'}\\ , ]    \\right > , \\label{eq : cov_ci_l}\\ ] ] where the angle brackets represent an ensemble average , @xmath19 is the true underlying power spectrum , @xmath90 is the window function of spectrum @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the point source contribution to spectrum @xmath93 . here",
    "we have defined a point source spectral function , @xmath94 , as @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are as defined after equation  ( [ eq : source_model ] ) .",

    "we thus rewrite @xmath103 as @xmath104    [ \\bar{c}^{\\bf j}_{l ' } - ( c_{l ' } + \\delta as^{\\bf j})w^{\\bf j}_{l'}\\ , ]    \\right > , \\label{eq : cov_ci_src}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the source - subtracted spectrum , and @xmath106 is the residual source amplitude , which we will marginalize over as a nuisance parameter .",
    "we may expand the covariance matrix as @xmath107 we discuss each of these contributions in more detail below .",

    "we have split this contribution into two pieces to mimic the procedure we actually use to compute the covariance matrix . as outlined in  [ sec : opt_combined ] , we start with @xmath110 , then incorporate the effects of point source error and window function error .",
    "we do not add the effects of mode coupling , @xmath111 , until the very end of the computation .",
    "we consider this term in more detail in appendix  [ sec : fisher ] .",
    "_ point source subtraction errors_. the third term , @xmath112 , is due to uncertainty in the point source amplitude determination @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the variance in the best - fit amplitude @xmath102 , and we assume that the frequency dependence , @xmath94 , is perfectly known . in practice , we do not explicitly evaluate @xmath112 as given above , rather we employ a method based on marginalizing a gaussian likelihood function , @xmath115 , over a nuisance parameter @xmath77 .",
    "this process , which is discussed in appendix  [ sec : marginalize ] , effectively yields @xmath116 .",

    "the _ wmap _  absolute calibration uncertainty is 0.5% .",
    "we do not explicitly incorporate this contribution in the covariance matrix .",
    "instead , we propagate a 0.5% uncertainty into the normalization of the final power spectrum amplitude @xcite .",
    "in  [ sec : data ] we demonstrated that the three high frequency bands of _ wmap _  data produced consistent estimates of the angular power spectrum , after a modest correction for diffuse galactic emission and extragalactic point sources .",
    "it is therefore justifiable to combine these data into a single `` optimal '' estimate of the angular power spectrum of the cmb . in this section ,",
    "we provide an overview of two methods we use to generate a single combined spectrum .",
    "the first is a multi - step process that simultaneously fits the 28 cross - power spectra presented above to a single cmb power spectrum and a point source model , equation  ( [ eq : source_model ] ) , while correctly propagating beam and residual point source uncertainties through to a final fisher matrix .",
    "this spectrum constitutes our best estimate of the cmb power spectrum from the first - year _ wmap _  data .",
    "the second spectrum , which serves as a cross check of the first , is based on forming a single co - added sky map from the q1 through w4 maps , and using the quadratic estimator with noise bias subtraction .",

    "since this method is relatively complicated , we outline the basic procedure here and relegate the details to appendices , as indicated .",
    "we present the result in  [ sec : compare ] .",
    "the steps are as follows .    1 .",
    "subtract best - fit galactic foreground templates from each of the maps q1 through w4 , using the coefficients given in table  3 of @xcite .",
    "2 .   evaluate the 28 cross - power spectra from the maps q1 through w4 , where each spectrum has been evaluated using the quadratic estimator of appendix  [ sec : quad_estimation ] with the weighting scheme defined in appendix  [ sec : weights ] .",
    "3 .   collect the noise bias estimate , @xmath129 , for each da from  [ sec : inst_noise ] .",
    "these estimates are used in the calculation of the covariance matrix for the combined spectrum , and in setting the relative weight of each cross - power spectrum in the final combined spectrum .",
    "4 .   apply the procedure presented in appendix  [ sec : amp_ps ] to obtain an estimate for the point source amplitude .",
    "the value obtained is @xmath130 , roughly independent of @xmath131 in equation  ( [ eq : ps_amplitude ] ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with an estimate based on the bispectrum @xcite , and on an extrapolation of point source counts @xcite .",
    "subtract the point source contribution from the cross - power spectra : @xmath132 .",
    "5 .   compute an approximate form of the full covariance matrix discussed in  [ sec : covariance ] , @xmath133 .",
    "the procedure we use produces a covariance matrix which includes cosmic variance , instrument noise , source subtraction uncertainties , and window function uncertainties . at this stage of the process",
    ", it does not yet include the effects of mode coupling .",
    "more details are given in ",
    "[ sec : covariance ] and appendix  [ sec : marginalize ] .",
    "invert the approximate covariance matrix for use in computing the optimal spectrum .",
    "this is the most computationally intensive step in the process .",
    "compute the final combined spectrum from the 28 @xmath88 as per the procedure given in appendix  [ sec : power_opt ] .",
    "in particular , assume a fiducial cosmological model ( as specified in the appendix ) , and use equation  ( [ eq : cl_comb ] ) , with @xmath134 .",
    "this produces a final spectrum which is very nearly optimal .",
    "+ note : for @xmath135 we use a surrogate procedure for computing the combined spectrum . in order to minimize galactic foreground contamination",
    ", we use only v and w band data . moreover , because the statistics of the @xmath19 are mildly non - gaussian , and because point source contamination and window function uncertainties are small , the `` optimal '' machinery developed above is unnecessary .",
    "rather we simply form a weighted average spectrum from the v and w band @xmath88 .",
    "compute the approximate inverse - covariance matrix , @xmath136 , for the combined spectrum using equation  ( [ eq : qll_comb ] ) .",
    "this matrix is approximate in two ways .",

    "2 ) it has been evaluated for a fiducial cosmological model , @xmath137 , while in a likelihood application , we need to evaluate @xmath138 for an arbitrary model , @xmath139  we add this next .",
    "9 .   introduce the dependence on cosmological model into @xmath136 as follows .",
    "invert @xmath136 to obtain the approximate covariance matrix of the combined spectrum , @xmath140 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms of @xmath140 are small and weakly dependent on cosmological model , so we expand @xmath140 as @xmath141 where @xmath142 encodes the mode coupling due to window function and source subtraction uncertainties .",
    "this relation defines @xmath142 , which we take to be zero on the diagonal .",
    "@xmath143 is dominated by cosmic variance and noise ; in order to separate the two contributions , we introduce an _ ansatz _ of the form @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the fiducial model used to generate the combined spectrum ( see appendix  [ sec : power_opt ] ) , and @xmath146 is the effective noise in the combined spectrum , which is defined by this equation .",
    "the dependence on cosmological model is introduced in the covariance matrix by re - computing @xmath143 with @xmath147 , leaving @xmath146 fixed .",
    "estimate the coupling induced by the foreground mask as described in appendix  [ sec : fisher ] .",
    "the effect of the mask on the off - diagonal elements of the fisher ( inverse - covariance ) matrix can be written as @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "this expression parameterizes , and defines , the off - diagonal mode coupling in the form of a correlation matrix , @xmath150 .",
    "note that @xmath151 , defined in appendix [ sec : fisher_interpol ] , is related to @xmath150 by @xmath152 .",
    "the final fisher ( curvature ) matrix , @xmath153 , is obtained using @xmath154    we further calibrate @xmath155 with monte carlo simulations .",
    "this calibration process , and a description of how the curvature matrix is used in a maximum likelihood determination of cosmological parameters , is given in  2 of @xcite .",
    "as part of the first - year data release , we provide a fortran 90 subroutine to evaluate the likelihood of a given cosmological model , @xmath139 , given the _ wmap _  data ( supplied in the routine ) .",
    "the code also optionally returns the fisher ( inverse - covariance ) matrix for the combined spectrum .",
    "our second approach is to form a single co - added map from the q1 through w4 maps , @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the sky map for da @xmath27 with the best - fit galactic template model subtracted , and @xmath158 is the noise per observation for da @xmath27 , given by @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the power spectrum of this map on the kp2 cut sky using the quadratic estimator in appendix  [ sec : quad_estimation ] .",
    "an effective noise model is obtained by using the same approach as described in  [ sec : inst_noise ] : we generate co - added noise maps from the library of end - to - end simulations , evaluate their average spectra , then fit a noise model . the noise bias model is then subtracted from the power spectrum of the combined temperature map .",
    "we have performed this analysis with 3 distinct pixel weighting schemes ( see appendix  [ sec : weights ] ) and 3 corresponding noise models .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : cf_weights ] where it is seen that the three cases are virtually indistinguishable .    in effect , this analysis uses both the auto- and cross - power spectra .",
    "we view this as a useful check of the more sophisticated procedure described in ",
    "[ sec : opt_combined ] , but we do not rely on it for a final result .",
    "uncertainties in the noise model only effect the fourth moment of the cross - power spectra , but they effect the second moment of the auto - power spectra and potentially bias the final result . the @xmath06% sensitivity advantage gained by including auto - power spectra",
    "was not deemed worth the effort required to guarantee that the final result was not biased .",
    "figure  [ fig : cf_combined ] compares the power spectra obtained from methods i and ii above . the combined cross - power spectrum from  [ sec : opt_combined ] is shown in black , the auto - power spectrum obtained in  [ sec : map_combined ] from the co - added map is shown in grey .",
    "the two methods agree extremely well with the only notable deviation being at the highest @xmath48 range probed by the first - year data .",
    "this is the regime where the auto - power spectrum will be most sensitive to the noise bias subtraction .",
    "as can be seen in the error estimates shown in figure  [ fig : final_spec ] , the deviation is less than 1@xmath159 .",
    "a separate test of robustness is to compute the angular power spectrum in separate regions of the sky to see if the spectrum changes .",
    "we have computed the power spectrum in two subsets of the sky ",
    "the ecliptic poles , and the ecliptic plane , using the quadratic estimator with the combined sky map .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : cf_plane_pole ] where the pole data is shown in grey and the plane data in black .",
    "the two spectra are very consistent overall , but some of the features that appear in the combined spectrum , such as the `` peak '' at @xmath160 and the `` bite '' at @xmath161 , are not robust to this test , thus we consider these features to be of marginal significance .",
    "there is also no evidence that beam ellipticity , which would be more manifest in the plane than in the poles , systematically biases the spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with estimates of the effect given by @xcite .",
    "our best estimate of the angular power spectrum of the cmb is shown in figure  [ fig : final_spec ] .",
