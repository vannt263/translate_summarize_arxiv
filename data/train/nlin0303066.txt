    "cellular automata ( ca ) has been one of the most studied fields in the research of complex systems .",
    "various patterns has been generated by choosing the rule tables .",
    "wolfram@xcite has classified these patterns into four rough categories : class i ( homogeneous ) , class ii ( periodic ) , class iii ( chaos ) and class iv ( edge of chaos ) .",
    "the class iv patterns have been the most interesting target for the study of ca , because it provides us with an example of the self - organization in a simple system and it is argued that the possibility of computation is realized by the complexity at the edge of chaos@xcite .",
    "+ much more detailed classifications of ca , have been carried out mainly for the elementary cellular automata ( 3-neighbor and 2-state ca)@xcite , in which the patterns are studied quite accurately for each rule table . and the classification of the rule tables are studied by introducing some parameters@xcite",
    ". however , in this case , there are some confusions in the classification of the class iv ca .",
    "the result on the so to speak @xmath4 task from packard@xcite have been different from that of mitchell , crutchfield and hraber@xcite . in this case",
    ", the number of the independent rule tables are so small to treat them statistically and the symmetry of the interchange of the states  0  and  1  make the classifications of the the pattern classes more delicate than those of other ca with @xmath5 . therefore , it may be worth to start with other models , in order to find the general properties of the ca .",
    "+ however the number of rule tables in n - neighbor and k - state cellular automata ca(n , k ) grows like @xmath6 .",
    "therefore except for a few smallest combinations of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the numbers of the rule tables become so large that studies of the ca dynamics for all rule tables are impossible even with the fastest supercomputers .",
    "therefore it is important to find a set of parameters by which the pattern classes could be classified , even if it is a qualitative one .",
    "+ langton has introduced @xmath0 parameter and argued that as @xmath0 increases the pattern class changes from class i to class ii and then to class iii . and class iv behavior is observed between class ii and class iii pattern classes@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter represents rough behavior of ca in the rule table space , but finally does not sufficiently classify the quantitative behavior of ca .",
    "it is well known that different pattern classes coexist at the same @xmath0 .",
    "which of these pattern classes is chosen , depends on the random numbers in generating the rule tables .",
    "the reason or mechanism for this is not yet known ; we have no way to control the pattern classes at fixed @xmath0 . and",
    "the transitions from a periodic to chaotic pattern classes are observed in a rather wide range of @xmath0 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a schematic phase - diagram was sketched .",
    "however a vertical axis was not specified .",
    "therefore , it has been thought that new parameters are necessary to arrive at more quantitative understandings of the rule table space of the ca .",
    "+ in this article , we will clarify the mechanism which discriminate the class i , class ii , class iii and class iv pattern classes at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "it is closely related to the structure of the rule tables ; numbers of rules which breaks strings of quiescent states . it is studied quantitatively by introducing a new parameter @xmath2 , which we will call quiescent string dominance parameter .",
    "it is taken to be orthogonal to @xmath0 . in the region",
    "@xmath9 , the maximum of @xmath2 corresponds to class iii rule tables while minimum of @xmath2 , to class ii or class i rule tables .",
    "therefore the transition of the pattern classes takes place somewhere between these two limits without fail . by the determination of the region of @xmath2 , where the change of the pattern classes takes place , we could obtain the phase diagram in ( @xmath0,f ) plane , and classify the rule table space . +",
    "the determination of the phase diagram is carried out for ca(5,4 ) .",
    "it is found that the rule tables are not separated by a sharp boundaries but they are represented by probability densities .",
    "therefore we define the equilibrium points of two phases where the two probability densities of the pattern classes become equal , and define the transition region where the probability densities of the both pattern classes are not too much different from each other . by using the equilibrium points and the transition region , we draw a phase diagram in ( @xmath0,f ) plane .",
    "+ it is found that @xmath0 dependences of the equilibrium points and transition region are very gentle , and they continued to be found at least over the range @xmath10 .",
    "it means that all the four pattern classes do coexist over the wide range in @xmath0 . our results for the distributions of these pattern classes in ( @xmath11 ) plane do not support the well known relation between the pattern classes and the @xmath0 parameter proposed in the ref.@xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the results there , are due to the methods to generate the rule tables with probability @xmath0 .",
    "+ in section ii , we briefly summarize our notations and present a key discovery , which leads us to the understanding of the relation between the structure of the rule table and pattern classes .",
    "it strongly suggested that the rules which break strings of the quiescent states play an important role for the pattern classes .",
    "+ in section iii , the rule tables are classified according to the destruction and construction of strings of the quiescent states and we find the method to change the chaotic pattern class into periodic one and vice versa while keeping @xmath0 fixed .",
    "we will show that by using the method , the change of the pattern classes takes place without fail , in the region @xmath12 .",
    "+ in section iv , the result obtained in section iii is studied quantitatively by introducing a new quiescent string dominance parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is determined by using the distribution of class iv rule tables , which we call optimal @xmath2 parameter .",
    "+ in section v , using @xmath2 and @xmath0 , we classify the rule tables of ca(5,4 ) in ( @xmath0,f ) plane .",
    "it will be shown that all the four pattern classes do coexist in wide range in @xmath0 , contrary to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite by langton .",
    "the reason why he obtained his result will be discussed .",
    "+ in section vi , the rule tables of ca(5,4 ) are classified in the ( @xmath0,f ) plane , which provides us with the phase diagram .",
    "+ section vii is devoted to discussions and conclusions , where a possibility of the transmission of the initial state information and the classification of the rule tables by the another intuitive @xmath2 parameter , will be discussed .",
    "in order to make our arguments concrete , we focus mainly on the one - dimensional 5-neighbor and 4-state ca ( ca(5,4 ) ) in the following , because this is a model in which langton had argued the classification of ca by the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "however the qualitative conclusions in this article , hold true for general ca(n , k ) .",
    "these points will be discussed in the subsections iii b. + we will briefly summarize our notation of ca@xcite . in our study , the site consists of 150 cells having the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the states are denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 represents the time step which takes an integer value , and the @xmath15 represents the position of cells which range from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath13 takes values @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the state @xmath16 is taken to be the quiescent state .",
    "the set of the states @xmath13 at a time @xmath14 is called the configuration . + the configuration at time @xmath20 is determined by that of time @xmath14 by using following local relation ,    @xmath21    the set of the mappings @xmath22",
    "is called the rule table .",
    "the rule table consists of @xmath23 mappings , which is selected from a total of @xmath24 mappings .",
    "+ the @xmath0 parameter is defined as@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number in which @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_table ] ) is not equal to @xmath16 . in other words",
    "the @xmath0 is the probability that the rules do not select the quiescent state in next time step . until section iii",
    ", we set the rule tables randomly with the probability @xmath0 .",
    "our method is to choose @xmath28 rules randomly , and set @xmath29 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_table ] ) , and for the rest of the @xmath26 rules , the @xmath27 picks up the number 1,2 and 3 randomly .",
    "the initial configurations are also set randomly .",
    "+ the time sequence of the configurations is called a pattern .",
    "the patterns are classified roughly into four classes established by wolfram@xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that pattern classes are classified by the @xmath0@xcite ; as the @xmath0 increases the most frequently generated patterns change from homogeneous ( class i ) to periodic ( class ii ) and then to chaotic ( class iii ) , and at the region between class ii and class iii , the edge of chaos ( class iv ) is located .      in order to find the reason why the different pattern classes are generated at the same @xmath0 , we have started to collect rule tables of different pattern classes , and tried to find the differences between them .",
    "we fix at @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , because we find empirically that around this point the chaotic , edge of chaos , and periodic patterns are generated with similar ratio . by changing the random number ,",
    "we have gathered a few tens of the rule tables and classified them into chaotic , edge of chaos , and periodic ones .",
    "+ in this article , a pattern is considered the edge of chaos ( class iv ) when its transient length@xcite is longer than @xmath32 time steps .",
    "+ first , we study whether or not the pattern classes are sensitive to the initial configurations .",
    "we fix the rule tables and change the initial configurations randomly . for most of the rule tables ,",
    "the details of the patterns depend on the initial configurations , but the pattern classes are not changed@xcite .",
    "the exceptions will be discussed in the subsection vii a , in connection with the transmission of the initial state information .",
    "thus the differences of the pattern classes are due to the differences in the rule tables , and the target of our inquiry has to do with the differences between them .",
    "+ for a little while , we do not impose a quiescent condition ( qc ) , @xmath33 , because without this condition , the structure of the rule table becomes more transparent .",
    "this point will further be discussed in section iv . + after some trial and error , we have found a strong correlation between the pattern classes and the qc .",
    "the probability of the rule table , which satisfies the qc is much larger in class ii patterns than that in the class iii patterns .",
    "this correlation suggest that the rule @xmath34 , which breaks the string of the quiescent states with length 5 , pushes the pattern toward chaos .",
    "we anticipate that the similar situation will hold for the length 4 strings of quiescent states . + we go back to the usual definitions of ca ; in the following we discuss ca under qc , @xmath33 .",
    "we study the correlation between the number of the rules which breaks the length four strings of the quiescent states .",
    "these rules are given by , @xmath35 they will also push the pattern toward chaos .",

    "we have 4 rule tables with @xmath37 , 13 rule tables with @xmath38 , 9 rule tables with @xmath39 and 4 rule tables with @xmath40 . when @xmath41 , all rule tables generate chaotic patterns , while when @xmath40 , only periodic ones are generated . at @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,",

    "in order to test the hypothesis of the previous section , we classify the rules into four groups according to the operation on strings of the quiescent states . in the following , greek characters in the rules represent groups @xmath42 while roman , represent groups @xmath43 .",
