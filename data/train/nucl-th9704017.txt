    "the @xmath12 atom ( pionium ) has become of considerable experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "such atoms have been clearly observed at dubna @xcite and a lower limit obtained for the lifetime @xmath13 of the lowest ( 1@xmath5 ) level @xcite .",
    "a large collaboration is engaged in an experiment at cern to measure @xmath13 with an accuracy of about 10@xmath14 @xcite . in the proposal for this experiment the possibility of measuring the difference @xmath15 between the energies of the 2@xmath5 and 2@xmath16 levels",
    "is also considered .",
    "the method was proposed by nemenov @xcite and its feasibility can be tested using the same experimental setup as for the measurement of @xmath13 .    a complementary approach has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite by a group at iucf .",
    "they have considered the possibility of measuring the ratio of the rates for the decay of @xmath12 , either in @xmath17 bound states or low - lying continuum states , into @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the known rate for the almost purely electromagnetic @xmath19 decay would then yield the rate for the @xmath18 decay . ref .",
    "@xcite indicates however that a first search for a suitable reaction with @xmath12 pairs in the final state has not yielded promising results .",
    "we therefore concentrate in this paper on the results expected to come from the cern experiment .",
    "a measurement of @xmath13 immediately yields the width of the 1@xmath5 level via the relation @xmath20^{-1}. \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] the partial width for decay to @xmath19 is very small , and can be derived from qed for bosons @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath21 @xmath22 being the fine structure constant and @xmath23 the mass of a charged pion .",
    "subtracting eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) gives the value of @xmath24 , which we shall henceforth abbreviate to @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath25 is expected to be about 0.177 ev and will be measured with an accuracy of around 10@xmath14 , no refined corrections to the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) are needed .",
    "we expect then that values of @xmath25 and , later , @xmath26 will become available from experiments on pionium .",
    "in section 2 we shall go briefly through the formalism for pionium , which is identical with that given by rasche and woolcock @xcite for pionic hydrogen . we shall give the explicit formulae for @xmath3(fm ) and @xmath4(fm ) in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath28w(ev ) respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath29 is the @xmath5-wave scattering matrix for the two - channel @xmath30 system at the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "the subscript @xmath31 refers to the @xmath12 channel , @xmath32 to the @xmath18 channel .",
    "the challenge we are addressing is to connect these numerical results , derivable in principle from experiments on pionium , with our knowledge of pion - pion scattering at low energies ( by which we shall mean that the total energy @xmath33 in the c.m .",
    "frame is less than about 500 mev ) .",
    "this knowledge comes from two sources , experiments in which pion - pion pairs in the final states of various reactions are studied , and chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath34pt ) , which gives a low - energy representation of the @xmath35 scattering amplitudes based on qcd .",
    "the difficulty of the problem lies in the subtle interplay of the two interactions present , the hadronic and the electromagnetic . the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 which come from pionium experiments are not due to the hadronic interaction alone : they are affected by the electromagnetic interaction . on the other hand , @xmath34pt as it has been developed so far , with the quark mass difference neglected and only the qcd lagrangian used , is a hadronic interaction theory which is charge independent ( isospin invariant ) .",
    "moreover , experiments above the @xmath12 threshold are analysed to give what are quoted as phase shifts for states of definite isospin ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38=0 , @xmath39=0 and 2 ; @xmath40 for @xmath38=1 , @xmath39 = 1;@xmath41 ) . in spite of this , as we shall see , neither @xmath34pt as it is presently applied , nor the analysis of experiments , completely disentangles the electromagnetic interaction from the hadronic .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that electromagnetic corrections need to be made , to relate the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtained from pionium to the values of the isospin invariant @xmath5-wave scattering lengths @xmath42 and @xmath11 obtained from above threshold experiments and @xmath34pt .",
    "one approach has been made in a recent preprint by maltman and wolf @xcite , who attempt to include the electromagnetic interaction as an additional symmetry breaking term in @xmath34pt in order to calculate the corrections to the purely hadronic @xmath35 scattering lengths . at this stage of their work too few details",
    "are given to fully evaluate its consequences for pionium .",
    "in this paper we use a potential model , considered previously by moor , rasche and woolcock @xcite , to calculate the electromagnetic corrections described above .    moor et al .",
    "@xcite attempted to calculate @xmath43 by distinguishing between the physical situation and the purely hadronic situation in which the electromagnetic interaction is switched off @xmath44 . in the first , the charged and neutral pions have their physical masses @xmath23 and @xmath45 respectively and the hadronic and electromagnetic interactions are present . in the second , there is only the hadronic interaction and , in accordance with current opinion @xcite , it is assumed that all the pions have almost the same mass , which is extremely close to @xmath45 , and that there is practically no isospin breaking of the hadronic scattering amplitudes .",
    "@xcite connects these two situations by means of a potential model . for the purely hadronic situation ,",
    "all the pions were taken to have the mass @xmath45 and only a charge independent hadronic potential was present .",
    "simple square well potentials were used in a relativistic schrdinger equation in order to reproduce at the energy @xmath46 the purely hadronic scattering lengths @xmath47 , obtained from @xmath34pt . for the physical situation",
    "a two - channel @xmath5-wave relativistic schrdinger equation was used , with physical masses and ( relativistic ) c.m .",
    "momenta at a fixed energy , the potential matrix being the sum of a hadronic potential and a coulomb potential for extended charge distributions . in the spirit of @xmath34pt",
    "it was assumed that the mass difference is the only source of symmetry breaking , so that the hadronic potential for the physical situation was taken to be exactly the same as the charge independent potential for the purely hadronic situation .",
    "the two - channel equation for the physical situation was then solved to obtain @xmath3 at @xmath48 , and thus the difference @xmath49 .",
    "there are two serious problems with the work in ref .",
    "first , the purely hadronic scattering lengths @xmath42 and @xmath11 were obtained by inserting the mass @xmath45 into the @xmath34pt equations of gasser and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "however some constants in those equations are fixed by using experimental data extrapolated to the @xmath12 threshold @xmath48 .",
    "this is an inconsistent procedure . in the present state of our knowledge",
    "it is not possible to obtain purely hadronic scattering lengths at the purely hadronic threshold @xmath46 .",
    "one is prevented by the fact that , in the analysis of experiments and in the practical use of @xmath34pt , the @xmath35 system at the hadronic level is treated as an isospin invariant system with all the pions having the mass @xmath23 . on the basis of this assumption charge independent phase shifts are obtained from experiments .",
    "this information is then used , in conjunction with the @xmath34pt equations ( the pion mass being taken as @xmath23 ) , to generate @xmath5-wave phase shifts @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath50 .",
    "sets of these phases have been provided to us by gasser @xcite .",
    "we note here that their behaviour at low energies is different from that in the fits of froggatt and petersen @xcite and lohse et al .",
    "@xcite . using the expansion @xmath51",
    "the @xmath34pt equations show clearly that @xmath52 , so that the curvatures @xmath53 have the same signs as the respective scattering lengths @xmath54 . for this reason",
    ", we have reservations about the potentials constructed by sander , kuhrts and von geramb @xcite , based on the fits of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second problem in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite is that simple square well potentials were used . to obtain the values of both @xmath54 and @xmath53 given by @xmath34pt ,",
    "it is necessary for such potentials to be energy dependent .",
    "further , moor et al .",
    "calculated the difference between the purely hadronic scattering matrix at @xmath46 and the physical scattering matrix at @xmath48 without taking into account the variation of their potentials with energy .",
    "this particular problem no longer arises in the present work , where we shall calculate electromagnetic corrections at @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless , there remain strong reasons for desiring an energy independent hadronic potential matrix @xmath55 if such potentials @xmath56 can be found , the representation of the strong interaction by a potential matrix which remains unchanged when the electromagnetic interaction is switched on is placed on much firmer ground .",
    "the assumption that the @xmath35 system at the hadronic level can be treated as an isospin invariant system with all the pions having the mass @xmath23 then translates into a two - channel schrdinger equation for which the equations decouple in the isospin basis .",
    "the mass @xmath23 plays the role of a convenient reference mass and we emphasise that the scattering lengths @xmath54 obtained from the potentials @xmath56 by using a schrdinger equation with this mass are isospin invariant but not purely hadronic quantities .",
    "there is a further question about how to construct energy independent potentials @xmath56 .",
    "if the phase shifts @xmath57 were perfectly known and the process remained elastic at all energies , it would be possible by inversion to construct potentials @xmath56 . however , there are substantial uncertainties in the values of @xmath57 ( and electromagnetic corrections in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite have not been made ) , there are inelastic processes at sufficiently high energy and , most important of all , there is no reason to believe that the hadronic interaction can be represented by potentials except at low energies .",
    "we therefore do not use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite but instead find potentials of simple shape , characterised by a small number of parameters , which can be fixed so that the potentials reproduce the phase shifts well up to @xmath58 mev .",
    "in fact double square wells with in all four parameters work quite satisfactorily .",
    "a sum of two gaussians or of two lorentzian shapes were also tried , but the fit to the phase shifts could not be further improved and it was more difficult to ensure that the potentials had no bound states .",
    "the double square well energy independent potentials @xmath56 are fed into the one - channel schrdinger equations @xmath59 and the ranges and depths of the two wells adjusted to obtain the best possible fit to the phase shifts @xmath57 up to @xmath58 mev .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) also yields the scattering lengths @xmath54 and we denote by @xmath60 the matrix @xmath61    for the physical situation we have the two - channel schrdinger equation with physical masses @xmath62 where @xmath63 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and @xmath64 the relativistic c.m .",
    "momenta @xmath65 in the two channels are calculated from the same value of @xmath33 ; @xmath66 is the coulomb potential between extended charge distributions .",
    "the coupled equations ( [ eq8 ] ) are integrated numerically to give the scattering matrix @xmath67 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the details are exactly the same as those given in section 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the coupled @xmath68 system ; the matrix @xmath69 introduced in eq .",
    "( 65 ) of that paper we now denote by @xmath67 , in accordance with the altered notation of ref .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath48 gives the threshold scattering matrix @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and thus the difference @xmath71 , which is the final goal of our calculation .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtained from experiments on pionium can then be corrected to give values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 which can be compared with the values obtained from above threshold experiments and @xmath34 pt . in section 3",
    "we shall give further details of the calculations sketched above , and the numerical results for the electromagnetic corrections .",
    "the results in this section for the positions and widths of the pionium states of interest come from the formalism of rasche and woolcock @xcite , which uses analytic continuation of the scattering matrix below the threshold for a channel containing two oppositely charged hadrons .",
    "these formal results have been confirmed by determining the position and width directly , by studying the behaviour of the phase shift for the ( open ) @xmath18 channel .",
    "we also remark that the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite is complete , and includes what are often ( misleadingly ) called hadronic effects on the wavefunction at the origin .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath17 states of pionium , which are quite different from ours , are known to be wrong .",
    "new results for the @xmath0 state are given in a recent preprint by sander and von geramb @xcite , but no comment is made on the dramatic difference between these new results and those of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the width @xmath25 for the decay of pionium in the 1@xmath5 state to @xmath18 is given in eqs .",
    "( 2.10 ) and ( 2.13 ) of ref .",

    "the treatment of the @xmath78 atom in ref .",
    "@xcite , from which the result , eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , is taken , takes account neither of the relativistic correction to the bound state position nor of the presence of the vacuum polarisation potential in the calculation of @xmath25 .",
    "the first is of no consequence at the level of accuracy with which we are concerned .",
    "a full treatment of the second has been worked out by oades , rasche and woolcock @xcite and leads to a small modification of eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the width in the presence of vacuum polarisation is increased by the factor @xmath79 ; this result has been obtained both analytically and by a computer calculation of the width with and without the vacuum polarisation potential .",
    "strictly speaking , the elements of the scattering matrix appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) should be the elements of the k - matrix at the bound state position , not at the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "the only significant effect is on @xmath80 ; the small modification to eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) is estimated in ref . @xcite and amounts to a factor @xmath81 .",

    "( [ eq10 ] ) may be roughly estimated as about 0.02@xmath14 .",
    "most of it comes from the uncertainty in the value of @xmath4 used to calculate @xmath88 .",
    "since the expected experimental accuracy in @xmath89 is about 5@xmath14 , the uncertainty in the conversion constant is of academic interest only .",
    "the difference @xmath26 between the energies of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 levels has contributions from the relativistic corrections , the vacuum polarisation potential and the presence of the hadronic interaction . from the results of austen and de",
    "swart [ 21 ] the relativistic corrections to the positions of the 2@xmath5 and 2@xmath16 states are @xmath90 @xmath91 using a vacuum polarisation potential modified at short distances to take account of the extended charge distributions of the pions , the corresponding shifts in the positions of the 2@xmath5 and 2@xmath16 states are @xmath92 thus @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the difference due to the hadronic interaction .    for the shifts in the positions of the 2@xmath5 and 2@xmath16 states due to",
    "the hadronic interaction we again appeal to the results of ref .",
    "for the 2@xmath16 state the shift is @xmath95 which is completely negligible .",
    "thus @xmath94 comes entirely from the shift in the 2@xmath5 state , @xmath96 where @xmath97 it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) that @xmath98 from our present knowledge of @xmath4 we expect that @xmath94 will be close to @xmath99 ev .",
    "the experimenters therefore face the difficult task of measuring with reasonable accuracy a difference @xmath26 which is about @xmath100 ev , compared with the position of the @xmath101=2 pure coulomb levels 464.52 ev below the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "the final step is to calculate the difference @xmath71 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) respectively .",
    "as explained in section 1 , the first step is to construct energy independent double square well potentials , using the schrdinger equation [ eq5 ] , which reproduce as accurately as possible up to 500 mev the phase shifts @xmath36 and @xmath37 provided by gasser @xcite .",
    "there are inner and outer ranges of the potentials to be varied , and it was found that the best fits are obtained with ranges @xmath104 the full potentials which we used to obtain the final results are , to 4 significant figures , @xmath105 @xmath106      fig .",

    "( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) reproduce the phase shifts of ref .",
    "@xcite remarkably well .",
    "not surprisingly , this agreement deteriorates above 500 mev but this is of no concern .",
    "the simple effective potentials clearly represent the hadronic interaction very well over an energy range which is quite sufficient for our purpose .",
    "the scattering lengths ( eq . ( [ eq16 ] ) ) come predominantly from the inner parts of the potentials in eqs .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) and the inner radius of 0.3 fm is approximately the smallest radius used by moor et al .",
    "@xcite for their single square well potentials .",
    "the use of the much larger outer radius of 1.5 fm with the small outer potential , is a simple way of getting good fits to the phase shifts .",
    "the scattering lengths in eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) differ from those of ref .",
    "@xcite mainly because the reference mass used in the @xmath34pt equations is @xmath23 , as explained in section 1 .",
    "the coulomb potential @xmath66 for extended charge distributions was taken as the potential between uniformly charged spheres , exactly as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( last paragraph of section 4 ) .",
    "we have checked that using gaussian charge distributions instead makes no difference to the scattering matrix in eq .",

    "the detailed numerical results are given in table 1 .",
    "on the basis of many calculations which we have made using different scattering lengths @xmath42 and @xmath11 as the starting values , we have found that the relative correction @xmath115 is much less sensitive to these starting values than is the difference @xmath116 . however , the difference @xmath117 is less sensitive than @xmath118 .",
    "the uncertainties in the values of @xmath117 and @xmath115 need to be estimated .",
    "even though some fine details of the potentials have no doubt been missed , we are confident that the use of double square well potentials introduces a negligible error . we have estimated the uncertainties due to the variation of the hadronic potentials within limits which correspond to the uncertainties in the input phase shifts and in our fitting procedure .",
    "this effectively includes the uncertainties in the input scattering lengths .",
    "the final results are @xmath119 where we have kept the number of significant digits appropriate to the size of the estimated errors .",
    "the development of two - loop @xmath34pt @xcite will result in slightly different phase shifts , but the resulting changes in @xmath120 and in @xmath115 will lie within the uncertainities given in eq .",
