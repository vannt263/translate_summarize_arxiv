    "rotating nuclei that have a triaxially deformed shape are expected exhibit a characteristic excitation mode called `` wobbling '' by bohr and mottelson @xcite , which is an orientation vibration of the triaxial body about the rotational axis .",
    "it is the nuclear analog to the motion of the classical top with three different moments of inertia , which is well known from the rotational spectra of molecules .",
    "experimental evidence for the wobbling mode was established by the discovery @xcite of rotational bands in the @xmath2lu isotopes when they attain a triaxial strongly deformed ( tsd ) shape at high spin .",
    "the simple dynamics of a rotor with three different moments of inertia results in an increase of the wobbling frequency with angular momentum , which is seen in molecules .",
    "however , for the lu isotopes a decrease is observed , which makes the identification of the wobbling possible , because it prevents the mode being fragmented among competing quasiparticle excitations . in the framework of the quasiparticle+triaxial - rotor ( qtr ) model , frauendorf and dnau @xcite demonstrated that the decrease results from the presence of the odd i@xmath3 quasi proton , which aligns its angular momentum along the short body axis , _ transverse _ to the medium axis with the largest moment of inertia . to notify the modification of the dynamics by the odd quasiparticle , they introduced the name `` transverse wobbling '' .",
    "they predicted the appearance of transverse wobbling for the mass 130 region , where the h@xmath4 quasiparticle couples transverse to the triaxial rotor .",
    "the prediction was recently confirmed for @xmath5pr @xcite .",
    "the qtr calculations well account for the wobbling energies and the b(e2)@xmath6 values of the @xmath7 electric quadrupole transitions , which connect the one - phonon wobbling band with the zero - phonon band .",
    "however , the b(m1)@xmath6 values of the connecting magnetic dipole transitions are overestimated by about a factor of 3 - 10 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the discrepancy turns out to be robust , and it can be traced back to the transverse geometry : for a quasiproton that is rigidly coupled to the triaxial charge density distribution ( hfa approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) the amplitude of the wobbling vibrations of the charge density , which generate the b(e2)@xmath1 values of the inter band transitions , determines the the amplitude of the vibrations of the magnetic moment of the odd quasi proton , which generate the b(m1 ) values of the inter band transitions .",
    "realistically , the odd quasi proton is not rigidly coupled to the rotor , which reduces the amplitude of the oscillations of the magnetic moment and thus the b(m1)@xmath1 values .",
    "however the reduction is too weak to bring down the b(m1)@xmath1 to the experimental values ( see fig .",

    "the present paper addresses this problem of the too strong magnetic dipole transitions from a microscopic perspective .",
    "following the discovery of the first wobbling structure in @xmath0lu  @xcite , hamamoto , hagemann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the qtr model to describe the wobbling mode .",
    "these calculations made the ad hoc assumption that the short axis has the largest moment of inertia , by exchanging the hydrodynamic moments of inertia of the short and medium axes .",
    "the large ratios b(e2)@xmath1/b(e2)@xmath8 of inter - band to intra - band e2 transitions could be well reproduced .",
    "the b(m1)@xmath1 were only overestimated by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "however , the calculated wobbling frequencies of the qtr model with the `` inverted moments of inertia '' assumption distinctly disagree with experiment . instead of the experimentally observed decrease , the wobbling frequency increases with the spin @xmath9 , which is expected because the inverted moment of inertia arrangement corresponds to the longitudinal wobbling geometry in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite suggested to remedy the problem by assuming a decrease of the scale of the rotational energy , which may reflect the increase of the moments of inertia due to a reduction of the pair correlations .",
    "in our view , the `` inverted moments of inertia '' assumption is unrealistic because any microscopic calculation of the three moments of inertia in the frame of the cranking model give the maximal moment of inertia for the medium axis .",
    "this result is in accordance with the hydrodynamic ratios between the moments of inertia .",
    "it can be qualitatively understood by the fact that the moment of inertia of a certain axis increases with the deviation from cylindric symmetry , which is maximal for the medium axis .",
    "hence , the problem with the too strong magnetic transition remains .",
    "the observation of the wobbling mode stimulated theoretical efforts to understand how the nuclear shell structure and the residual interaction generate such a type of collective excitations .",

    "the angular momentum of the odd i@xmath3 quasiparticle aligns with this axis .",
    "the decrease of the wobbling frequency is interpreted as the approach of the instability of the cranking solution to a tilt of the rotational axis into the short - medium plane , which is signaled by the frequency of the lowest qrpa solution to become zero @xcite .",

    "+ -the b(m1)@xmath1 values of the inter band transitions are overestimated by a factor of 10 as for the qtr results for transverse wobbling .",
    "the qrpa calculations @xcite used an isoscalar quadrupole - quadrupole ( qq ) residual interaction . because such interaction generates the same coupling between the odd quasiparticle and the triaxial rotor core as in the qtr calculations , it comes as no surprise that both approaches overestimate b(m1)@xmath1 values by the same factor .",
    "the reason to revisit the qrpa in this paper is to investigate how modifying the residual interaction influences the resulting excitation energies and electromagnetic transition rates .",
    "in particular we are interested whether the suppression of the inter band m1 transitions can be obtained for transverse wobbling .",

    "it is the question , what makes that the magnetic de - excitation so small .",
    "it is known that the scissors mode collects the low - lying m1 strength which is concentrated higher up in the energy region of 3 - 4 mev @xcite .",

    "when adding interaction terms the strength constants of which are not fixed by selfconsistency or rotational invariance the rotational modes shift away from their true energies @xmath61 and mix with the wobbling mode , such that the results are distorted by spurious effects .",

    "our first modification was motivated by the purely collective picture of the scissors mode being an angle vibration of the proton system against the neutron system with an iv qq restoring force @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we added to the isqq hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) an iv qq interaction term built from the operators @xmath65 - @xmath40 . knowing the selfconsistent strength @xmath66 from table  [ tab : defs ] we set the isovector strength @xmath67 where the value of the ratio @xmath68 was varied in the range -1.5 to -3.5 @xcite .",

    "we included both the is and the isovector ( iv ) spin - spin interactions defined by @xmath70 we determined the ss strength parameters by extrapolating the a - dependent strength parameters given in the work of de coster and heyde @xcite used there for qrpa calculations of the 1@xmath69 .",

    "the lowering of the b(m1)@xmath1 value is small , i.e. there is not much shift the m1 strength into the scissor region .",

    "the systematics of the summed b(m1 ) strength presented in refs.@xcite provides a clue concerning the coupling constant .",

    "the agreement indicates that the coupling of the transverse wobbling to the scissors mode at high spin and the m1 strength of the low - spin scissors mode can be accounted for by one and the same value of @xmath78 .",
    "the improvements achieved by including the iv ll interaction term can be taken as an indication that the wobbling motion is not a pure orientation vibration of the quadrupole mass tensor with respect to the angular momentum vector .",
