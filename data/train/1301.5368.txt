    "early - type supergiant stars are the most luminous stars in the universe , and their intense radiation is responsible for driving their powerful stellar winds .",
    "absorption of uv photons by metal ions ( e.g. n iv , o iv , fe - group elements ) transfers momentum to the ions .",
    "winds driven by this mechanism are known as line - driven winds . in the 1970 s",
    "it was realized that , if the momentum gained by the metal ions could be shared with the hydrogen and helium ions , which are more abundant , then this process could lead to significant mass loss ( lucy & solomon , 1970 ; castor , abbott & klein , 1975 ) .",
    "the global properties of line - driven winds are successfully described by a spherically symmetric , homogeneous model wind with a velocity that increases radially outward .",
    "this model leads to the classic p cygni profiles indicative of mass loss .",
    "an example of a p cygni profile for @xmath0 ori can be seen in the spectrum of 2002 february 6 shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "however , some observations can not be explained by this simple model . the observed x - ray emission from hot stars is believed to be due to shocks within the wind , which may be due to the inherent line - driven instability of these winds , first described by lucy & solomon ( 1970 ) .",
    "the observed electron - scattering wings of recombination lines in wolf - rayet stars are too weak to be matched by synthetic line profiles unless wind clumping is included in the models ( hillier ( 1991 ) .",
    "finally , line profile variability is observed in the spectra of early - type stars .",
    "this variability , typically observed in uv and optical lines , may be related to structure in the winds , stellar pulsations , or magnetic activity .",
    "line profile variability in ob stars was firmly established with observations from the iue satellite in unsaturated p cygni profiles in the ultraviolet .",
    "the emission component is fairly constant while absorption features are superimposed on the broad , blue absorption troughs",
    ". commonly referred to as discrete absorption components ( dacs ) , these features typically move blueward across the profile and often recur at regular intervals on the order of the estimated rotational period .",
    "their cyclical nature is thought to be due to co - rotating interaction regions ( cirs ) ( mullan , 1984 ; cranmer & owocki , 1996 ; kaper et al .",
    "the cirs may form when a density enhancement at the base of the wind propagates outward and forms a spiral density pattern in the wind as the star rotates .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the formation of the cirs in hot stars is not known but is likely due to disturbances at the photosphere .",
    "cantiello et al .",
    "( 2009 ) propose that the cause may be tied to magnetic fields arising in sub - surface convection zones and that micro - turbulence due to these convection zones may be responsible for inducing wind clumping near the photosphere .",
    "the h@xmath1 line profiles of hot massive stars are also known to be highly variable .",
    "the wind contribution of the h@xmath1 line , being mainly formed by recombination and therefore proportional to the square of the electron density , is formed in the dense inner wind region . in the case of weak wind emission ,",
    "the observed h@xmath1 profiles often alternate between p cygni , inverse p cygni , pure emission , and double absorption .",

    "in addition , correlations between uv and h@xmath1 variability ( kaper et al .",
    "1997 ) and between x - ray and h@xmath1 variability ( berghoefer et al . 1996 ) have been reported in o - stars .",
    "this implies the propagation of structures or disturbances throughout the wind .",
    "the search for a photosphere - wind connection in massive stars is of current interest .",
    "stellar pulsations may affect the mass loss by coupling to the wind ( townsend 2007 ) .",

    "the advantage of the technique is that it allows one to determine the level of statistical significance of detected line profile variability .",

    "the range of significant variability was then used in defining the wavelength region over which the equivalent width , @xmath26 , was measured .",
    "the goal was to define a consistent wavelength range for each line that would be used for all @xmath26 measurements without excluding any significant variability .",

    "this method attempts to minimize any wind contribution to the radial velocity variability .",
    "however , in cases of particularly strong wind absorption or emission , it is possible that the wind may contribute to variability in the line core .",
    "the radial velocity data may be found in table 4 .",
    "the errors for the radial velocity measurements were calculated using the method of brown ( 1990 ) .",
    "a typical value for @xmath30 is @xmath60.25 km s@xmath16 .",
    "previous radial velocity studies using the same instrument at ritter observatory have found an instrumental error of 0.25 km s@xmath16 due to motions of the ccd relative to the spectrum .",
    "the instrumental errors and the measurement errors were added in quadrature to produce the total error of the radial velocity data .",
    "the spectra shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig1 ] demonstrate the variability in the h@xmath1 and he i @xmath25876 lines of @xmath0 ori .",

    "the velocity scale has been converted to the stellar rest frame .",
    "significant variability extends beyond the @xmath31 threshold in both lines .",
    "the range of significant variability for h@xmath1 extends approximately -350 to 300 km s@xmath16 while for he i , the range is roughly -200 to 175 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the variability in both lines is confined to velocities much less than the terminal wind speed of 1600 km s@xmath16 ( searle et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 tvs are fairly symmetric , with the exception of the 2003 - 2004 season , and the peaks are shifted toward the blue .",
    "this indicates that the bulk of the observed variability occurs in the column of wind material approaching the observer .",
    "the he i tvs are characterized by double peaks with the central minimum occurring near rest velocity as one would expect for a line undergoing radial velocity variations .",
    "the double peaks are nicely contained within the @xmath1391 km s@xmath16 threshold , consistent with a photospheric origin for the radial velocity variations .",
    "it should be noted that the projected rotational velocity is an upper limit , since the line broadening is likely due to macroturbulence in addition to rotation ( ryans et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the he i tvs tend to be slightly asymmetric with broader wings on the blue side , likely due to the wind absorption often seen on the blue edge .",
    "the h@xmath1 photospheric absorption is heavily filled in by wind emission and photospheric variability is masked by the wind .",
    "to better understand the underlying photospheric absorption , a tlusty photospheric model with a superimposed @xmath0 ori h@xmath1 spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum , from 2001 dec 21 , is an example of a minimum emission profile .",
    "the synthetic profile is from the bstar2006 grid of nlte line - blanketed model atmospheres ( lanz & hubeny 2007 ) .",
    "the model has parameters very similar to those of @xmath0 ori with @xmath32 k , @xmath33 , @xmath34 km s@xmath16 , and solar metallicity ( see table 2 and references therein ) . the model profile has not been rotationally broadened .",
    "even when the emission is weak , it is clear that the absorption is nearly completely filled in by wind emission .",
    "variability in the strength of wind emission gives rise to the many observed profile types .",
    "for example , strong emission gives rise to the emission or p cygni profiles seen in the nov 22 and feb 6 spectra of fig .",
    "weaker wind emission leads to the double absorption - type profile in the dec 21 spectrum shown in fig .",
    "since wind emission is the dominant factor in shaping the observed profile of h@xmath1 , most of the variability in the measured net equivalent widths is likely attributable to the wind .",
    "however , in the case of constant wind emission , variability in the measured equivalent widths could be due to a variable photospheric component .",
    "in contrast to h@xmath1 , the morphology of the he i @xmath25876 line is dominated by photospheric absorption . however , weak wind features are observed as absorption in the red and blue wings and emission in the red wing .",
    "it is important to note that the range used in measuring the he i equivalent widths ( 5871.7 - 5879.8 ) included a portion of these wind signatures .",
    "the absorption in the blue wing seen in most of the spectra is fairly broad and does lie within the region of significant variability .",
    "wind absorption is also observed on the red edge as well , as seen in the dec 22 spectrum of fig .",
    "this absorption in the red occurs over a narrower region but also lies within the region of significant variability .",
    "weak emission in the red wing , as seen in the nov 6 spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is observed much less frequently and occurs right on the edge of the region of significant variability , near 5880 .",
    "this emission also occurs at the edge of the region over which the equivalent widths are measured ; therefore , any contribution would be very minor and may not be significant .",
    "boyajian et al . ( 2007 ) observed a correlation between h@xmath1 emission and radial velocity changes in the he i @xmath26678 line in the b3 ia supergiant hd 61827 .",
    "they attribute the radial velocity variations to weak wind emission in the red wing of the he i line causing an apparent shift of line center toward the blue .",
    "therefore , although the core of the he i @xmath25876 line in @xmath0 ori appears to be photospheric , the variability in the measured radial velocities could have a wind origin .",
    "the equivalent widths of h@xmath1 and he i , and the radial velocities were plotted against one another to look for any correlations between them .",
    "these plots are shown in fig .",
    ". there does appear to be a weak , positive correlation between the equivalent widths of h@xmath1 and he i , with a pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath35 = 0.29 .",

    "the significance of periodogram peaks is the false alarm probability ( fap ) .",

    "the line profile variability of the h@xmath1 and he i @xmath25876 lines in the supergiant @xmath0 ori has been examined through time - series analysis of spectra from seven seasons of observations .",
    "this star has a strong and variable stellar wind , as demonstrated by its highly variable h@xmath1 line which is observed to have several profile morphologies including p cygni , inverse - p cygni , double absorption , and pure emission .",
    "profiles of the h@xmath1 line show net emission approximately 65% of the time .",
    "the he i line is primarily an absorption line with weak wind features in the wings of the line .",
    "the he i profile is seen to sway back and forth , possibly indicating pulsational radial velocity oscillations .",
    "temporal variance spectra were calculated for each season for both spectral lines .",
    "the tvs clearly show that both lines undergo significant variability extending beyond @xmath13@xmath57 region indicating the presence of wind variability . in both cases , the variability is greatest on the blue side of line center .",
    "the tvs for the he i line has a double - peaked profile indicative of radial velocity oscillations due to pulsations .",
    "the double peaks are contained within the @xmath57 region consistent with a photospheric or near photospheric origin for the radial velocity variations .",
    "the region of significant variability defined by the 99% confidence level of the tvs was used to set the wavelength regions over which equivalent width measurements were made for the h@xmath1 and he i spectra .",
    "radial velocity measurements were also made from the central absorption of the he i profile .",
    "a periodicity search was carried out on data from six of the seven seasons individually . a technique that applies",
    "bayesian statistics to the lomb - scargle periodogram was employed on the equivalent width , radial velocity , and binned - spectra time series .",
    "the clean algorithm was also used on the equivalent width time series .",
    "numerous periods were identified in the variability as a result of these analyses .",
    "all periods identified in the bayesian analysis had corresponding ls periodogram peaks that exceeded the 5% false alarm probability .",
    "phase diagrams were created for each identified period and a sinusoidal function was fit to the phased data .",
    "the resulting phase plots indicate that several of the periods are harmonic .",
    "periods on the order of the rotational period of the star ( 13 - 18 d ) were found in data from two seasons indicating possible rotational modulation .",
    "sinusoidal modulation was evident in the phase diagrams in both cases . in the 1998 - 1999 observing season , periods were detected in the he i equivalent width data . in the 2004 - 2005 h@xmath1",
    "and he i equivalent width data , periods of 19.1 to were found .",
    "a period was also present in the 5876 and 6563 bins in the 2d periodograms from that season .",
    "this is a possible overtone of the period .",
    "most of the periods identified were in the range of .",
    "many of these periods were present in both h@xmath1 and he i data and exhibited sinusoidal patterns in their phase diagrams .",
    "stellar pulsations are a possible origin of this variability and provide evidence for a connection between the photospheric activity and the wind . particularly intriguing is the fact that periods of are present in every season and were found in both lines .",
    "this may represent a persistent mode of variability in this star .",
    "the spectral variability of @xmath0 ori is clearly complex and in need of further study .",
    "stellar pulsation modeling of this star is needed in order to determine if the periods reported here can be produced by radial or non - radial pulsations .",
    "observationally , a campaign to acquire simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric data could provide conclusive evidence for a connection between stellar pulsation and wind variability . a more complete time series at optical and uv wavelengths , probing the inner and outer wind regions ,",
    "would provide a more complete picture of the wind variability .",

    "this work was partially supported by an nsf - prest grant ( ast-0440784 ) awarded to nancy morrison and karen bjorkman .",
    "support for the acquisition of these spectra at ritter observatory came from : the university of toledo , the fund for astrophysical research , inc . , and the american astronomical society small research grants program .",
