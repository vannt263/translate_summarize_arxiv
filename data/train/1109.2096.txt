    "the nature of dark matter and dark energy is one of the most important issues today in physics",
    ". there are strong observational evidences in astrophysics and cosmology for the existence of these two exotic components of the cosmic energy budget , indicating that about @xmath2 of the universe is composed of dark matter ( about @xmath3 ) and dark energy ( about @xmath4 ) , but no direct detection has been reported until now .",
    "the usual candidates to dark matter ( neutralinos and axions , for example ) and dark energy ( cosmological constant , quintessence , etc . ) lead to very robust scenarios , but at same time they must face theoretical and observational issues . for recent reviews on the subject , see for example @xcite .    an interesting proposal concerning the nature of dark matter and dark energy",
    "are the unification models . according to the latter ,",
    "the whole dark sector is a manifestation of a single entity .",
    "the paradigm is a perfect fluid model called chaplygin gas @xcite , but recently it has also been shown that viscous models may lead to unification scenarios @xcite . in spite of their great appealing , however , unification models suffer from severe problems when confronted with observations , since the parameter estimations from different tests lead to contradictory values @xcite .",
    "one way to surmount this conflict is to encode the unification model in a scalar - tensor framework , the exotic fluid being described by a self - interacting scalar field .",
    "it is not easy to implement this idea , since a canonical self - interacting scalar field has a sound speed equal to the speed of light , and it can not represent dark matter in the past evolution of the universe , as required by the unification program @xcite .",
    "a scalar model that is able to represent a realization of dark matter and dark energy can be obtained with non - canonical self - interacting scalar fields .",
    "one example is a scalar field obeying the structure of rastall s theory , for which the usual conservation law for the matter content is modified @xcite .",
    "the price to pay is the loss of a lagrangian formulation , at least in the context of riemannian geometry . in rastall s theory",
    "a new dimensionless parameter @xmath5 is introduced , which measures the departure from the usual equations of general relativity . when @xmath0 , the general relativity theory is recovered . as in the case of other unification scenarios ,",
    "the theory is able to satisfactorily reproduce the kinematic background observational tests ( e.g. based on type ia supernovae surveys ) , but essentially reduces to general relativity if a hydrodynamical approach is used for the fluid obeying the new conservation laws and the matter power spectrum data are used @xcite .",
    "however , the agreement improves if a non - canonical scalar field is employed instead of a fluid .",
    "moreover , if @xmath6 this non - canonical scalar field may behave as dark matter , and may lead to a unification scenario @xcite .    can rastall s theory pass another important test , represented by the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ? in order to answer this question , the gravitational potential @xmath7 must be analysed . using the newtonian gauge , we find an astonishing property of rastall s theory : in a scenario with just one component , given by the non - canonical rastall scalar field , only homogeneous solutions for @xmath7 are admitted , unless @xmath0 . but homogeneous solutions for @xmath7 are not real perturbations , since they can be re - absorbed in the background metric through a suitable reformulation of the background functions .",
    "thus , the case @xmath0 seems to be forced .",
    "this fundamental drawback can be cured if a two - fluid model is formulated : one scalar field obeying the modified conservation laws , and a fluid obeying the canonical conservation law .",
    "the main conclusion is : rastall non - canonical scalar field requires a matter component ( baryons , for example ) in order for the theory to make sense at the perturbative level .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the rastall non - canonical scalar field . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the sound speed issue in this theory , and in section 4 we investigate the evolution of the gravitational potential and find the constraint @xmath0 . in section 5 ,",
    "we show how to soothe such constraint , by adding a canonical fluid component , and we study the gravitational potential in a special case . in section 6 , we present our conclusions .",
    "in rastall s theory @xcite a scalar field @xmath8 is characterised by the following stress - energy tensor : @xmath9 where @xmath5 is a parameter . when @xmath0 , we recover the corresponding theory in general relativity .",
    "we consider a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric @xmath10 and its perturbation written in the newtonian gauge @xmath11dt^2 - a^2(t)[1 - 2\\phi(t , x^i)]\\delta_{ij}dx^idx^j\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the gravitational potential .",
    "consider a scalar field perturbation of the form @xmath13 and derive from eq .   together with eqs .   and the background and first - order perturbed mixed - component stress - energy tensors .",
    "the former is @xmath14\\delta^i{}_j\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the scalar field energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "the perturbative quantities have the form @xmath18\\delta^i{}_j\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the spatial derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the modified klein - gordon equation has the covariant form @xmath22 where @xmath23 from eq .",
    ", it appears clearer that @xmath0 restores the general relativity case .",
    "insert again @xmath24 into eq .   and",
    "employ metric and , in order to find @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hubble parameter . employing the conformal time @xmath27 we write @xmath28 where the prime denotes derivation with respect to the conformal time and @xmath29 .",
    "the perturbed modified klein - gordon equation has the following form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .    differently from the @xmath0 case , in rastall s theory",
    "we have more degrees of freedom . indeed , considering @xmath32 @xmath33 = \\left(1 - \\gamma\\right)\\phi^{,\\mu}\\phi_{;\\mu;\\nu}\\;,\\ ] ]",
    "one notices that the contraction with @xmath34 gives the klein - gordon equation , eq .",
    "however , eq .   are actually four independent equations . only in the @xmath0 case",
    "they reduce to only one , namely the usual klein - gordon equation . using eq .   into eq .",
    "one obtains @xmath35 at the background level , being @xmath36 dependent only on the time , eq .",
    "is identically satisfied . for small perturbations , eq .",
    "gives the perturbed klein - gordon equation for @xmath37 , whereas for @xmath38 one has @xmath39 for @xmath1 one can cast the above equation as follows : @xmath40 which appears to be an additional constraint that we have to take into account together with the einstein s equations .",
    "in @xcite the authors investigate the case corresponding to @xmath6 , which is able to reproduce the @xmath41cdm scenario both at the background and at the perturbative level .",
    "a possible explanation for the success of the case @xmath6 may reside in the fact that in such instance the speed of sound vanishes , as we show now .",
    "the speed of sound is defined as the ratio @xmath42 , which is gauge - dependent .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to consider its value in the reference frame where the substance whose collapse is being investigated is at rest ; we denote such quantity as @xmath43 .",
    "following @xcite , we employ the formula @xmath44 which links the pressure perturbations to the energy density ones , both in a generic gauge , via @xmath45 . in this formula",
    ", @xmath46 is the adiabatic speed of sound , defined as @xmath47 and which , for the rastall scalar field that we are investigating , has the form @xmath48 where we have employed eqs .  , and the equation of motion .",
    "moreover , in formula , @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the wavenumber coming from a normal mode decomposition and @xmath51 is defined via @xmath52 substituting in eq .",
    "the expressions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , that we have found in eqs .   and , and eqs .",
    "and we obtain @xmath55 = \\nonumber\\\\ = ( 2 - \\gamma)\\left[\\gamma\\dot{\\phi_0}\\dot{\\delta\\phi } - \\gamma\\phi\\dot{\\phi_0}^2 + ( 3 - 2\\gamma)v_{,\\phi}\\delta\\phi + 3h\\dot{\\phi_0}\\delta\\phi\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which clearly gives that @xmath56 and therefore the case @xmath6 implies @xmath57 , which is a favouring case for the collapse .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the einstein tensor from metric and combine it with the perturbed stress - energy tensor in eqs .  . in particular",
    ", as we implicitly anticipated in writing the perturbed metric , since @xmath58 we have only one gravitational potential .",
    "see @xcite for more detail .",
    "we obtain @xmath59\\;,\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{g0i } \\mathcal{h}\\phi_{,i } + \\phi'_{,i } = 4\\pi g\\phi_0'\\delta\\phi_{,i}\\;,\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ \\phi '' + 3\\mathcal{h}\\phi ' + \\left(2\\mathcal{h } ' + \\mathcal{h}^2\\right)\\phi + ( 2 - \\gamma)\\left(\\mathcal{h}^2 - \\mathcal{h}'\\right)\\phi = \\nonumber\\\\ 4\\pi g\\left[(2 - \\gamma)\\phi_0'\\delta\\phi ' - ( 3 - 2\\gamma)a^2v_{,\\phi}\\delta\\phi\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also used the background relation @xmath60 .",
    "now we reduce the above system in two different ways which , however , will give different results unless we choose @xmath0 .",
    "let us employ a normal mode decomposition .",
    "the second equation can thus be written as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "now , if we sum or subtract the first equation with the third , use @xmath61 in order to eliminate @xmath63 and the equation of motion in order to eliminate @xmath64 we obtain : @xmath65 - \\frac{2v_{,\\phi}a^2}{\\gamma\\phi_0'}(3 - 2\\gamma)\\left(\\mathcal{h}\\phi + \\phi'\\right)\\;,\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq2 } \\phi '' + 3\\mathcal{h}\\phi ' + \\left(2\\mathcal{h } ' + \\mathcal{h}^2\\right)\\phi = \\nonumber\\\\ -k^2\\phi - 3\\mathcal{h}\\frac{2 - \\gamma}{\\gamma}\\left(\\mathcal{h}\\phi + \\phi'\\right ) - \\frac{2v_{,\\phi}a^2}{\\gamma\\phi_0'}(3 - 2\\gamma)\\left(\\mathcal{h}\\phi + \\phi'\\right)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations can be identical only if @xmath0 , which is the general relativity limit of rastall s theory .",
    "actually , these equations could be consistent also if @xmath66 , but what does this mean ?",
    "going back to the einstein equations , before the normal modes decomposition , @xmath66 would mean @xmath67 , which implies that @xmath7 should be a homogeneous field , i.e. @xmath68 . note that any spatial linear dependence for @xmath7 would be unacceptable since the field would diverge at infinity .",
    "but if @xmath7 is homogeneous , then we are not facing real perturbations .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient in metric to redefine the time and the scale factor as follows : @xmath69dt^2\\ ; , \\qquad \\bar{a}^2(t ) = a^2(t)[1 - 2\\phi(t)]\\;,\\ ] ] and we obtain again the flrw metric in the usual reference frame , with @xmath70 the cosmic time .    therefore we conclude that a consistent perturbation theory , formulated in the newtonian gauge , is possible only for @xmath0 .",
    "is such result compatible with the new constraint that we have showed to exist in rastall s theory , for @xmath1 ?",
    "the answer is yes , since combining eqs .   and",
    "it is possible to obtain eq .  .",
    "therefore , the latter is not an actual constraint : it is already embedded in einstein s equations .",
    "the result found in the previous section appears to be different if we introduce another component together with the rastall scalar field .",
    "indeed , let us consider a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath71 and @xmath72 constant .",
    "we write its total ( i.e. background plus perturbed ) stress - energy tensor as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the usual density contrast , @xmath53 is the density perturbation , @xmath54 is the pressure one and @xmath75 is the velocity .",
    "we assume adiabatic perturbations , i.e. @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "employing again the normal mode decomposition , we rewrite the system of linearised einstein equations as follows : @xmath78 where we have defined : @xmath79 @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the velocity potential defined by @xmath82 .    with the fluid variables and the relation @xmath76 we have a total of four unknowns @xmath83 but only 3 equations .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to obtain again a constraint as strong as @xmath0 .",
    "let us investigate in some detail the coupled system fluid plus rastall scalar field .",
    "multiplying eq .   by @xmath84 , eq .   by @xmath5 and subtracting the two",
    "we obtain : @xmath85 from this equation we eliminate @xmath63 with the help of eq .  , obtaining @xmath86\\nonumber\\\\   + 4\\pi g a^2\\rho\\left(\\gamma c_{\\rm s}^2 + \\gamma -2\\right)\\delta\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath87 .",
    "we now assume the fluid to satisfy its own energy - momentum conservation , separately from the scalar field , in order to gain one more equation necessary to solve the system .",
    "from @xmath88 , for the fluid component only , we get : @xmath89 now we have to specify the background evolution , i.e. the function @xmath90 .",
    "its general form is @xmath91\\;.\\ ] ] in order to simplify considerably eq .  , we assume that the potential is a constant , i.e. @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , it is going to play the role of an effective cosmological constant .",
    "if the potential is a constant , it turns out from the klein - gordon equation that @xmath93 and the friedmann equation takes on the following form : @xmath94 with the definitions @xmath95 finally , trading the conformal time for the scale factor , we write the coupled system of einstein equations plus the fluid equations as @xmath96\\phi_{a } + \\left[\\frac{2\\gamma\\dot{\\mathcal{h}}}{\\mathcal{h}a } + \\frac{6 - 2\\gamma}{a^2}\\right]\\phi + ( 2 - \\gamma)\\frac{k^2}{\\mathcal{h}^2a^2}\\phi = \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{3h_0 ^ 2}{2\\mathcal{h}^2}\\omega_0 a^{-3(1 + w)}\\left(\\gamma c_{\\rm s}^2 + \\gamma",

    "we start the evolution from @xmath98 and choose as initial conditions @xmath99 , @xmath100 .    with the choice @xmath101 and @xmath6 , eqs .   and reproduce the same dynamics of the @xmath41cdm model .",
    "it is curious that this seems to happen only when a standard fluid is added to the rastall scalar field .     and @xmath102 for the choice @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "the black solid lines represent the case @xmath6 , i.e. the @xmath41cdm one .",

    "that is , we are assuming that the perfect fluid under consideration is a baryon component .",
    "we have also chosen a scale @xmath106 h mpc@xmath107 .     and @xmath102 for the choice @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "the black solid lines represent the case @xmath6 , i.e. the @xmath41cdm one .",

    "we have chosen a scale @xmath106 h mpc@xmath107.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    it seems that , for @xmath109 , the growth of the density contrast of the fluid component is enhanced .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that @xmath110 becomes negative and therefore the collapse of the scalar field is unimpeded .",
    "for @xmath111 the growth of @xmath102 is sensibly hampered .",
    "it is curious in how the gravitational potential suffers a larger decrease for the case @xmath108 than for the @xmath0 one .",
    "we would have expect the contrary , since for @xmath0 the speed of sound is @xmath112 , whereas for @xmath113 the speed of sound is @xmath114 , i.e. smaller .",
    "note that such discrepancy is not present in the plots for @xmath102 , i.e. the growth for @xmath108 is larger than the one for @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , such effect is probably due to the different background evolution .    for completeness",
    ", we display here also the evolution of @xmath115 , which can be easily calculated from eq .",
    ", once we know @xmath7 and @xmath102 .",
    "the results are plotted in .     for the choice @xmath101 and @xmath103 . from top to bottom : @xmath116 .",
    "we have chosen a scale @xmath106 h mpc@xmath107.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    some comments about eq .",
    "are in order , since the latter establishes a strong connection between perturbations in the scalar field and in the gravitational potential . for a single scalar field component",
    ", rastall s theory reduces to general relativity , thus everything runs as in the standard lore . on the other hand",
    ", the coupling with matter brings new features . here",
    "also comes the complexity given by the new conservation law of rastall s theory , which admits many consistent alternatives . if the matter component conserves separately ( as we have investigated in this paper ) , eq",
    ".   remains untouched .",
    "however , there are examples in which it may change , e.g. the case in which matter exchanges energy with the scalar field or the one investigated in @xcite , where two fluid components were considered , one of them still conserving separately , whereas the conservation of other depending on the curvature . in this case , it is not difficult to show that relation   gives place to @xmath117 rendering the situation somewhat different . in @xcite",
    "other possible couplings between the two components are also evoked , which may lead to other variants for eq .  .",
    "even if our interest in this work is the late - times universe , we may ask for potential consequences of eq .   and its possible variants for the primordial spectrum .",
    "one point is that rastall s scalar model requires another component in order to make sense .",
    "but , an adiabatic primordial spectrum can be naturally implemented mainly if the matter component is subdominant with respect to the scalar component .",
    "the isocurvature component can also be implemented , in principle , since it requires a zero total ( scalar plus matter ) density fluctuation @xmath118 , and this even if the relation   still holds , as in the case where the other component conserves separately , without direct interaction with the scalar field .",
    "when other types of interactions between both components are considered , as in the equation above , the isocurvature perturbation can still exist .",
    "but , in general , the detailed predictions for the spectrum must differ from the standard cases , mainly in the isocurvature case .",
    "this may open a new path of investigation concerning the specific predictions of rastall s theory for the primordial spectrum of perturbations .",
    "equation   also reminds the relation between the spatial curvature and the inflaton field , in the standard inflationary scenario @xcite .",
    "however , such connection still has to be investigated in detail , in order to understand how inflation could be implemented into rastall s theory .",
    "the scalar formulation of rastall s theory of gravity may allow a consistent unification of dark matter and dark energy for the background evolution of the universe .",
    "we have shown in this paper that , on the other hand , its single component version ( with the non - canonical rastall scalar field as the only matter content ) is perturbatively inconsistent : the compatibility of the perturbed equations requires a homogeneous gravitational potential , which is equivalent to a redefinition of the background functions and not to real perturbations .",
    "the rastall scalar theory may admit consistent perturbative scenario if another ( canonical ) fluid component is added .",
    "for a two - fluid model , we numerically evaluate the behaviour of the gravitational potential and that of the density contrast for the scalar field component .",
    "for some cases , as @xmath119 , a behaviour very similar to that obtained in the general relativity case with a quintessence field is obtained .",
    "although this does not represent an exhaustive study of the rastall two - component model , the results here reported indicate that consistent scenarios may emerge from a rastall unification model for dark energy .",
    "we hope to present in future a more exhaustive study with a detailed comparison with cosmological observational data .",
