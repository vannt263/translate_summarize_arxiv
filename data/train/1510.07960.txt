    "since the mid 1990s , experiments on single molecules of double stranded dna have been performed @xcite . in some of these experiments ,",
    "the molecule is held torsionally constrained at a constant stretching force . upon turning the molecule sufficiently ,",
    "the dna transitions from a regime of stretched states into the supercoiled regime . in this regime ,",
    "the dna is believed to coil around itself to form plectonemes and the torque exerted on the apparatus plateaus over the number of turns .",
    "such an experiment is sketched in figure  [ fig : fccwalk_experimental_setup ] . in between the stretched and supercoiled regime",
    "lies the so called buckled regime .    in 2008",
    "@xcite and thereafter @xcite , it was observed that , depending on the salinity of the solvent , the transition between the regimes becomes rather abrupt .",
    "this phenomena has been dubbed abrupt buckling transition .    in the literature",
    ", some of the mechanics of the experiments is modelled by treating dna as a mathematical ribbon .",
    "according to the calegarenu - white - fuller theorem @xcite , this allows a decomposition of the number of turns added to the molecule , into writhe , total twist and a constant .",
    "more details on mathematical modeling of dna in general can be found in @xcite .",
    "details relating particular to the mechanics of the performed experiments , and which are relevant for this paper , are given in @xcite .",
    "there are different approaches towards modeling such experiments .",
    "free energy models are very phenomenological but can provide exact solutions .",
    "they allow the inclusion of many details related to the dna molecule .",
    "specifically , in @xcite the free energy is developed around three stable solutions of the elastic rod called straight , buckled and supercoiled ( post - buckled ) .",
    "however , these models do not include potential fluctuations that are induced by correlations across the whole molecule .",
    "this makes them mathematically less interesting .",
    "also , although in these models the buckling transition is set up to be a first - order phase transition , it is arguable that this transition is really just an abrupt transition ( but not a phase transition ) in a more fundamental model .    the alternative approach is to analyze the partition function directly . to obtain useful results , a basic general model must incorporate several features .",
    "structures like plectonemes emerge only as a consequence of self - avoidance of the polymer model and also writhe ( and therefore linking number ) only exists for self - avoiding curves .",
    "next , one needs to be able to pick only states of a given linking number .",
    "finally , the ensemble needs to contain only configurations without knots .",
    "this restriction to a knot type makes it impossible to date to treat the problem analytically .",
    "sketch of an experiment that turns ( green curved arrows ) double stranded dna under tension ( red vertical arrow ) .",
    "initially , most of the turns are expected to be absorbed in the form of twist .",
    "due to the twist rigidity of the molecule , twisting causes the dna to exert a restoring torque on the cylinder . upon turning sufficiently , the dna transitions into a regime where it is expected to form plectonemes .",
    ", width=226 ]    in this paper , we consider the second approach . however , we are not interested in details specific to dna .",
    "instead , we consider the experiment performed on the interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) .",
    "the most famous isaw model weights saws by the number of contacts between distant vertices .",
    "this model exhibits a second - order phase transition from a random coil phase into a globule phase as the quality of the solvent decreases .",
    "variants of this model apply a pulling force which makes the collapse transition first - order @xcite .",
    "other models consider an energy cost associated with bending the walk . when the walk is sufficiently stiff , the collapse transition becomes a first order crystallization transition from the coiled phase into the crystal phase .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram spanned by solvent quality and stiffness contains a triple point with the three phases coil , crystal and globule @xcite incident .",
    "the isaw model used here weights unknotted saws on the face centered cubic lattice by their writhe .",
    "we will argue that this relates to interpreting the saw as a twist storing lattice polymer on which the above experiment is performed .",
    "we use the wang - landau - algorithm @xcite to analyze the model for scaling in the derivatives of the free energy .",
    "this allows us to infer possible phase transitions .",
    "when the knot type is not restricted , the corresponding model has been treated by a mapping onto an @xmath0 field theory @xcite . in this work",
    "it was suggested that a sufficiently strong coupling to writhe collapses the walk . in a later work @xcite a writhe induced first - order transition was predicted .",
    "in fact , we had previously performed corresponding simulations @xcite and found signs of a first - order transition , which turned out to be a transition between knot types .    in this work , we find signs of a second - order transition upon weighting walks by their writhe when knot type is fixed .",
    "although , this transition is marked by fluctuations in self - contacts , we argue that it is not the collapse transition , but a transition into a writhed phase .",
    "in addition , we consider the effect of stiffness and pulling to observe behaviour qualitatively compatible with experiments performed on dna .",

    "the saw is attached to a surface and a cylinder mimicking conditions of experiments that turn tsps.,width=302 ]    in order to model mechanics of turning a twist storing lattice polymer , we require the definition of a lattice ribbon . for our purposes ,",
    "we think of a lattice ribbon @xmath1 as a pair formed by a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) @xmath2 and a vector field @xmath3 on @xmath2 , so that we have two numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are multiples of writhe and twist , respectively . in particular ,",

    "we anchor @xmath2 at the origin , i.e. @xmath17 and define a force axis @xmath18 .",
    "we require all vertices of the walk to lie on or above a plane that lies perpendicular to @xmath19 through @xmath20 , i.e @xmath21 .",
    "the last vertex , @xmath22 is required to lie on the axis @xmath23 , for some integer @xmath24 .",
    "we then append another vertex @xmath25 to the walk .",
    "this vertex has no degree of freedom so it does not count towards the length , however we require it to properly define the writhe of this non - closed walk .",
    "we imagine a second plane through @xmath26 such that no vertex can lie on or above this plane , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "finally , we imagine to connect @xmath28 and @xmath22 through a planar walk @xmath29 whose arch is wide enough so that its rotation ellipsoid around @xmath19 is disjoint with @xmath2 .",

    "we have derived the formula  [ eq : wr_polygonal_writhe ] in @xcite .",
    "alternative expressions for the writhe of polygonal curves can be found in @xcite , however some of these are not appropriate for the kind of simulation performed here . for reasons explained in the next section",
    ", we use the observables @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath42 measure @xmath43 times the distance of the final vertex from @xmath20 .",

    "we remark that the subscripts to the betas are merely a pairing label , not an index , i.e. , @xmath53 does not depend on @xmath44 . to keep notation short ,",
    "we collect some of the observables as @xmath54 and the corresponding couplings as @xmath55 .",
    "we denote the density of states by @xmath56 , so that the partition function of the constant linking number @xmath57 ensemble is given by @xmath58 where , using the cfw theorem , @xmath59 picks only the ribbons that have linking number @xmath57 . discrete laplace transformation of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath57 yields the conjugated fully canonical ensemble of ribbons @xmath61 where @xmath62 is related to torque .",
    "this ensemble corresponds to an experiment that keeps the polymers under a fixed torque rather than linking number .",
    "therefore , we refer to it as the constant torque ensemble .",
    "so far , we have not specified how the vector field @xmath3 should look .",
    "suppose that a rule of constructing @xmath3 is such that the number of ribbon frames with total twist @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath63 is independent of @xmath2 , then @xmath64 and the partition function factors according to @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "as we are interested in the singularity structure of the free energy @xmath68 , the factoring  ( [ eq : factz ] ) of the partition function implies that we may examine the scaling of the derivatives of @xmath69 and @xmath70 independently to obtain information of the potential critical points of the system .",
    "however , because total twist is a quantity that is computed along the walk , we do not expect any singularities associated with @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , we can focus on  ( [ eq : z_wr ] ) , which only requires us to perform simulations of a saw rather than a ribbon .",
    "we note that even in the case @xmath72 , our partition function @xmath73 contains a boltzmann factor @xmath74 , where the writhe @xmath4 is obtained by relating near and distant parts of the walk to each other .",
    "therefore , the torque @xmath62 can induce long distance correlations across the polymer .",
    "but this means that the system might potentially become critical .",
    "in fact , we have examined the partition function @xmath75 in systems which do not preserve the topology @xcite . in this case",
    ", we found a first - order transition between knot types associated with the partition function .",
    "we recall that the convenient factorization  ( [ eq : factz ] ) is due to two reasons .",
    "first , we work in the conjugated constant torque ensemble . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath76 , the ensembles are equivalent so that any inference we make about phase transitions should also hold in the linking number ensemble .",
    "the second reason is relation  ( [ eq : fac ] ) .",
    "although , we can certainly make a rule so that ( [ eq : fac ] ) holds , it is not necessarily natural on the fcc lattice .",
    "however , the resulting factoring of the partition function  ( [ eq : factz ] ) is also obtained in continuous models of dsdna .",
    "for example , compare ( [ eq : factz ] ) to formula ( 6 ) in @xcite , where the ribbon frame is attached to the continuous worm like chain model .",
    "therefore , imposing condition  ( [ eq : fac ] ) yields a simple model compatible with non - lattice models in the literature .",
    "let @xmath5 be the algorithm time , then , at given length @xmath10 , the wang - landau algorithm ( wla ) can be used to obtain an estimate @xmath77 of the microcanonical entropy @xmath78 where one expects that for large enough times @xmath79 .",
    "we can consider the wla as a pair @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the current state of the algorithm .",

    "we use three kinds of move :    bond  flip : :    a vertex @xmath12 is selected randomly .",
    "it is    randomly moved onto one of the lattice sites that neighbor both    @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "kink  transport : :    a vertex @xmath12 is selected randomly .",
    "if    @xmath93 and @xmath94 are    neighbors @xmath12 is removed and inserted either    between two different vertices or it is appended at the end in    @xmath95 direction .",

    "we note that every move has its inverse move .",
    "the moves are applied randomly , but in a way that detailed balance is satisfied .",
    "when a move yields a state that is not in the ensemble , for example the state is not self - avoiding , we set @xmath96 .",
    "the authors in @xcite assumed that the combination of bond - flips and kink - transport ( pull moves for a sap ) are ergodic within the knot type of a polygon on the sc lattice .",
    "we will assume the same to be true for the restricted walk on the fcc lattice considered here .",
    "one can easily convince oneself that the move set is ergodic within the desired ensemble for length @xmath97 . in dealing with the wla , it is common practice to split the space of macrostates @xmath98 into overlapping subsets @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 and generate estimates @xmath102 over @xmath99 .",

    "it is interesting to note from the top right graph that the writhe actually grows across the writhed phase so that it takes its highest value in the globule phase .",

    "we expect an applied torque to counteract stiffness as the polymer needs to bend in order to form writhe .",
    "this suggests that when the polymer is stiffer than the stiffness at the ( coil - globule - crystal ) triple point , we may recover a transition into a globule phase by applying torque .",
    "figure  [ fig : c_2_scaling - bs2 ] provides some support for this idea .",

    "we weighted these saws by their writhe and interpreted this as a model of twist storing polymers like dna . in this framework , the coupling of the writhe is regarded as being related to a torque applied to the dna .",

    ", we examined the finite size system for signatures of phase transitions in the coupling space spanned by torque and solvent quality .",
    "our results suggest that weighting the writhe of flexible saws induces a second - order phase transition from a coiled phase into a writhed phase .",
    "however , this transition is very weak and at the lengths considered here , we were not able to observe it via the moments of the writhe",
    ". however , the number of contacts shows weak scaling so that by considering the problem in the torque - solvent quality plane , we were able to conjecture that the transition should lie at @xmath228 . in this plane , we conjecture three phases exist : coil or extended , globule and writhed .",
    "the first two of these are well known from standard polymer collapse .",
    "it will be interesting in the future to investigate more closely the transition into the writhed phase as we were unable to estimate critical exponents .",
    "the nature of the point between the three phases would also be of interest .",
    "then , we considered the case of pulled , semi - flexible polymers .",
    "when pulling a saw the coil ( extended ) phase immediately becomes a stretched phase with anisotropic size scaling .",
    "however , both the globule phase , as has previously been ascertained , and the writhed phase remain .",
    "the addition of pulling seems to make the stretched - writhed and stretched - globule transitions more pronounced than their coil - writhed and coil - globule counterparts . in particular , the stretched - globule transition becomes first - order , as is well known .",
    "the writhed - globule and stretched - writhed transitions seem to be second - order although our data is once again not sufficient to meaningfully estimate the associated scaling exponents .    finally , we briefly discussed the case of very stiff polymers , which are known to undergo a first - order freezing transition as the quality of the solvent is reduced .",
    "we showed some evidence that by applying torque , this first order transition appears to vanish .",
    "instead , we saw a continuous transition into the perhaps globule phase .",
    "clearly , the stiff regime requires further investigation .",
    "we point out that this might be relevant to experiments on dna , as the latter is stiff enough to undergo a first - order transition into an ordered ( crystal - like ) phase when the solvent quality is reduced .",
