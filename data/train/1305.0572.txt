    "however , the study of the proper motion could not detect any significant motion for this source , while the radio spectral variability and the one - sided structure further require the presence of boosting effects in a relativistic jet .",
    "the 15 ghz light curve ( sec .",
    "[ ovro ] ) is highly variable . in particular , two outburst episodes are clearly present : the first peaks at mjd 54923 , and the second peaks at mjd 56139 .",
    "these outbursts seem to take place when a flux enhancement is also observed in @xmath0-rays .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics in @xmath0-rays are not adequate to allow a study of the variability on time - scales short enough to be related to the radio monitoring , while in the optical and uv bands the time sampling was too poor .",
    "for this reason , we estimate the variability time - scale @xmath49 on the basis of the radio data , similarly to @xcite . for @xmath50",
    ", we assume the time interval of the flux density variation to be between the minimum and maximum flux density of a single outburst @xmath51 .",
    "this assumption implies that the minimum flux density corresponds to a stationary underlying component and the variation is due to a transient component .",
    "taking into consideration the time dilation due to the cosmological redshift we find that the intrinsic time lag is @xmath52 , while the intrinsic flux density variation at the observed frequency is @xmath53 .",
    "the brightness temperature at a given frequency is    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath56 is the solid angle of the emitting region , and @xmath57 is the speed of light . using the causality principle , we can determine the angular size of the region responsible for the outburst    @xmath58    knowing that the solid angle is    @xmath59    we derive the rest - frame brightness temperature from    @xmath60    during the two outburst episodes we have flux density variability @xmath61 185 and 216 mjy , respectively , while @xmath62 75 and 85 d , respectively .",
    "if in equation  ( [ tbrest ] ) we consider these values , and we assume @xmath63 , i.e. the average value obtained by fitting the optically thin spectrum ( tables [ vla - flux ] and [ vlba - flux ] ) , we obtain t@xmath64 @xmath11 2.5@xmath210@xmath65 k , which exceeds the value derived for the compton catastrophe .",
    "assuming that such a high value is due to doppler boosting , we can estimate the variability doppler factor @xmath66 , by means of    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the intrinsic brightness temperature . assuming a typical value @xmath68= 5@xmath210@xmath69 k ,",
    "as derived by e.g.  @xcite , we obtain @xmath70 6.6 .",
    "another way to derive a lower limit to the doppler factor is by means of the jet / counter - jet brightnesses ratio . assuming that both the jet and counter - jet have the same intrinsic power , the different brightness observed can be related to doppler boosting by means of    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the jet and counter - jet brightness , respectively , @xmath74 is the viewing angle , @xmath10 is the bulk velocity in terms of the speed of light .",
    "we prefer to compare the surface brightness instead of the flux density because the jet has a smooth structure without clear knots .",
    "we measured the jet brightness as 20 mjy / beam in the 15 ghz image . in the case of the counter - jet , which is not visible",
    ", we assumed an upper limit for the surface brightness that corresponds to 0.15 mjy / beam , i.e. 1@xmath24 noise level measured on the image . from the brightness ratio estimated from equation  ( [ ratio ] ) we obtain @xmath10cos@xmath75 0.8 , implying that the minimum velocity is @xmath76 ( corresponding to a minimum bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 = 2.8 ) and a maximum viewing angle @xmath77 . from the minimum values",
    "derived , we can estimate a lower limit to the doppler factor by means of    @xmath78    and we obtain @xmath47 @xmath17 1.7 .",
    "we remark that the doppler factors estimated by means of variability and jet / counter - jet brightness ratio are lower limits .",
    "the doppler factor obtained in @xcite by modelling the sed is much larger , @xmath47 = 18 .",
    "the discrepancy may be a consequence of the different emitting regions .",
    "the radio variability is likely produced in the core component instead of along the jet .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0-ray emission can be produced in a very compact region , as suggested by the very short variability time - scale observed in some fsrqs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such a small region is usually self - absorbed at the typical radio frequencies ( cm and mm wavelengths ) .",
    "indeed , the fit used to model the sed in @xcite does not take into consideration the radio data .",
    "on the other hand , the region responsible for the radio emission is related to regions of the jets that are further away from the central agn , where the opacity is less severe .",
    "a black hole mass of 4@xmath210@xmath79 m@xmath80 was estimated by @xcite for pks 1502@xmath1036 on the basis of the h@xmath10 broad line .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite derived a black hole mass of 2@xmath210@xmath81 m@xmath80 by means of the sed modelling of the source .",
    "as in the case of sbs 0846@xmath1513 , radio and @xmath0-ray properties of pks 1502@xmath1036 seem to show the characteristics of a ( possibly young ) blazar at the low end of the black hole mass distribution .",
    "a core - jet structure has been resolved at 15 ghz in vlba images of pks 1502@xmath1036 .",
    "the main difference with respect to sbs 0846@xmath1513 seems to be a fainter jet - like structure and no observed apparent superluminal motion .    in fig .",
    "[ mwl ] , we compare the @xmath0-ray light curve collected by _",
    "fermi_-lat during 2008",
    "august2012 november to the x - ray ( 0.310 kev ) , uv ( @xmath82 filter ) , optical ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 filters ) and radio ( 15 ghz ) light curves collected by _ swift _ , crts and ovro .",
    "no significant flaring activity was detected in @xmath0-rays .",
    "the lack of significant @xmath0-ray variability is not surprising taking into account that only 40% of the agn in the second lat agn catalogue ( 2lac ) clean sample has shown a clear variability @xcite .",
