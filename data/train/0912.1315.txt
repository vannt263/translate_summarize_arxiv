    "all of these items can be determined by scanning the relators of @xmath275 .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath127 .",
    "then , since @xmath99 is disjoint from edges of @xmath365 connecting @xmath371 to @xmath372 or @xmath373 to @xmath374 , @xmath375 must appear in the relators of @xmath275 with exponents having at most three absolute values , say @xmath376 , @xmath377 and @xmath378 , with @xmath379 , and then the labels of the faces of the @xmath375-hexagon must be in clockwise cyclic order either @xmath380 or @xmath381 .    next , scanning the relators of @xmath275 shows @xmath201 appears with exponents having absolute values @xmath96 , @xmath382 and @xmath383 , while @xmath202 appears with exponents having absolute values @xmath65 , @xmath384 and @xmath385 . up to orientation reversing homeomorphism of @xmath370 , the cyclic order of the labeling of the faces of one of the handles of @xmath370 may be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "so we may label the faces of the a - handle of @xmath370 with @xmath386 in clockwise cyclic order . then , with the cyclic order of the labels of the a - handle specified , it is easy to see that , because @xmath387 , @xmath388 and @xmath389 appear in @xmath275 , the faces of the b - hexagon of @xmath370 must be labeled in clockwise cyclic order @xmath390 if @xmath370 is to realize @xmath275 .",
    "next , let @xmath391 , for @xmath127 , denote the total number of appearances of @xmath375 in the relators of @xmath275 with exponent having absolute value @xmath173",
    ". then @xmath392 , @xmath393 , @xmath394 , @xmath395 , @xmath396 , @xmath397 , and clearly these values determine the number of connections in each isotopy class of connections on the two handles of @xmath370 .",
    "it remains to determine how edges of @xmath370 connect endpoints of connections on the a - hexagon of @xmath370 with endpoints of connections on the b - hexagon of @xmath370 .",
    "in general , each 2-syllable subword of the relators of @xmath275 of the form @xmath398 with @xmath399 and @xmath400 corresponds to an edge of @xmath370 which connects an endpoint of a connection in the face of the a - hexagon of @xmath370 with label @xmath401 to an endpoint of a connection in the face of the b - hexagon of @xmath370 with label @xmath55 . in particular , since @xmath392 , there must be a set @xmath114 of 9 edges in @xmath370 connecting the 9 endpoints of connections in the face of the a - hexagon of @xmath370 with label @xmath402 to 9 consecutive endpoints of connections in the boundary of the b - hexagon of @xmath370 .",
    "one can see where these 9 consecutive endpoints of edges in @xmath114 are located in the boundary of the b - hexagon in the following way . for each @xmath403 ,",
    "let @xmath404 denote the total number of appearances of two syllable subwords in the relators of @xmath275 of the form @xmath405 .",
    "a scan of the relators of @xmath275 shows the only nonzero values in this set are : @xmath406 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "this implies the edges of @xmath114 must appear in @xmath370 so that @xmath114 is the disjoint union of subsets of 2 , 3 and 4 edges which meet the faces of the b - hexagon of @xmath370 with labels 7 , 9 and 2 respectively .",
    "it is easy to see there is only one way to do this . and",
    "this , in turn , implies that how edges of @xmath370 connect endpoints of connections on the a - hexagon of @xmath370 with endpoints of connections on the b - hexagon of @xmath370 is completely determined .",
    "the resulting r - r diagram @xmath370 appears in figure [ dist3fig9b ] .",
    "one checks easily that @xmath370 realizes ( [ second pres ] ) .",
    "and , by construction , it is an r - r diagram of a genus two heegaard splitting of @xmath0 .",
    "[ min length under auts ] suppose @xmath409 is a two - generator , two - relator presentation in which both @xmath410 and @xmath411 are cyclically reduced cyclic words .",
    "if there is an automorphism of the free group @xmath366 generated by @xmath201 and @xmath202 which reduces the length of @xmath275 , then one of the four whitehead automorphisms @xmath412 will also reduce the length of @xmath275 .      [ [ the - two - genus - two - splittings - of - boldsymbolm - are - not - homeomorphic ] ] the two genus two splittings of @xmath295 are not homeomorphic ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      consider how the simple closed curves @xmath165 , for @xmath413 intersect the bands of connections @xmath414 in @xmath415 in figure [ dist3fig9a ] and figure  [ dist3fig9b ] .",
    "it is not hard to see that , in both figures [ dist3fig9a ] and [ dist3fig9b ] , the graph @xmath416 of the heegaard diagram @xmath417 of @xmath100 and @xmath101 with respect to @xmath182 and @xmath183 has the form of figure [ dist3fig8b]a with @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "it follows from lemma [ c > a+b > 0 and d > a+b > 0 imply minimal ] , that , in both diagrams , the set of cutting disks @xmath98 of @xmath54 is the unique complete set of cutting disks of @xmath54 intersecting @xmath418 minimally .",
    "next , since corollary [ sets of sums exist ] shows that , in both figure [ dist3fig9a ] and figure [ dist3fig9b ] , @xmath97 is a set of sums , it follows that , in both figures [ dist3fig9a ] and figure [ dist3fig9b ] , the set of simple closed curves @xmath419 form the unique minimal complexity heegaard diagram carried by the splitting surface @xmath3 .",
    "however , in the heegaard surface @xmath3 of figure [ dist3fig9a ] , @xmath420 = 121 , while in the heegaard surface @xmath3 of figure  [ dist3fig9b ] , @xmath420 = 149 . since these minimal complexities differ , the heegaard surfaces of @xmath0 in figures [ dist3fig9a ] and [ dist3fig9b ] are not homeomorphic .",
