    "the classic view of the s - process nucleosynthesis in massive stars is that it occurs in he- and c - burning regions of the stars , producing only the low mass range of the s - process elements , typically the elements with an atomic mass number below about 90 - 100 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it has also been shown , that in the regions where the s - process occurs , the fact that , when the metallicity decreases , 1 ) the neutron source , mainly the @xmath6ne(@xmath7 reaction , decreases ; 2 ) the neutron seeds ( fe ) also decreases ; 3 ) the neutron poisons as for instance @xmath8o remain independent of the metallicity ; implies that the s - process element production decreases with the metallicity and that there exists some limiting metallicity below which the s - process becomes negligible .",
    "this limit was found to be around @xmath9/z@xmath10=10@xmath11 .",
    "first attempts to investigate the possible role of rotational mixing on the s - process production in massive stars have shown that this classic picture could be significantly revised .",
    "the impact of rotation on the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in low-@xmath9 massive rotating stars was studied by @xcite . in that study",
    "the @xmath0-process production was investigated by assuming different concentrations of primary @xmath6ne in the convective he - burning core , guided by the early results of .",
    "presented @xmath12 stellar models at various metallicities and with different initial rotation rates using an @xmath0-process network of 612 isotopes up to the end of core he - burning and 737 isotopes during the later stages .",
    "the main results of these works were that the s - process production could be boosted in models with strong rotational mixing , that isotopes with an atomic mass heavier than 100 can be synthesised and that very different ratios of first to second peak s - process element ratios can be obtained depending on the rotation rate .",
    "the main reason for these changes comes from the following process : rotational mixing allows the production of large amounts of @xmath5n in the h - burning shell , @xmath5n , which , once engulfed into the he - burning core , is transformed into @xmath6ne via two @xmath13captures .",
    "increasing the quantity of @xmath6ne favours s - process production since the main neutron source is the @xmath6ne(@xmath7 reaction .",
    "nevertheless , the limiting factors mentioned just above at low metallicity , namely the decrease of the seeds while the amount of important neutron poisons does not change , remain whatever the star is rotating or not .",
    "thus rotation act mainly on one of the aspect of the s - process nucleosynthesis , the neutron source via the amount of @xmath6ne , leaving the other more or less the same as in the non - rotating models .",
    "rotation can also have an impact on the s - process through its influence on the size of the h- and he - burning cores , but these effects remain modest compared to the impact linked to the @xmath6ne .    while the above - mentioned studies provide already the general trends of how rotation will impact the s - process production , they focus on only one initial mass . in the present work",
    "we extend the mass range explored . in that respect , this is the first extended grid of this kind that is published and we hope that this will trigger new theoretical predictions in the future exploring other physics , such as the impact of an internal magnetic fields or of the presence of a close binary companion .    before entering into the main body of this paper , we would like to emphasize an additional point , the fact that rotation has a particularly strong impact at low metallicity , and therefore on the evolution and nucleosynthesis of the first stellar generations in the universe .    due to their low metal content , they are more compact and rotate faster than their equivalents found in the milky way .",
    "this view is supported by observations of an increasing be / b - type star ratio with decreasing metallicity and by faster rotating massive stars in the smc compared to the milky way .",
    "fast rotating stellar models at low @xmath9 have been calculated by and . in these models ,",
    "nitrogen yields are much larger than in non - rotating models . when yields from these rotating models are used as input in chemical evolution models , a nice fit of the n / o in very metal poor halo stars can be obtained .",
    "the nitrogen production in rotating low-@xmath9 stellar models is accompanied by large production of other isotopes like @xmath14c , and especially @xmath6ne , which is , as reminded above , the neutron source for @xmath0  process in massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the observation of large @xmath0-process enhancements in one of the oldest globular clusters in the bulge of our galaxy supports the view that massive stars could indeed be also important sources for these elements @xcite , highlighting the need for comprehensive calculations of @xmath0  process in low-@xmath9 massive rotating stars .",
    "this motivated us to produce a large grid of low-@xmath9 massive rotating star models including a full @xmath0-process network .",
    "the observations by @xcite and @xcite were later updated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite confirmed that at least part of the stars in the globular cluster ngc 6522 is compatible with the @xmath0-process production in fast - rotating massive stars at low metallicity . galactic chemical evolution ( gce )",
    "models using the larger grid of models were presented in ( with some modifications explained in these papers ) and showed that rotation - induced mixing is able to explain the large scatter for [ sr / ba ] observed in extremely metal poor stars . in this paper , we present the large grid of low-@xmath9 massive rotating star models including a full @xmath0-process network used in the gce models listed above .",
    "we describe our models in [ sec : models ] . the mixing induced by rotation and the production of primary @xmath6ne",
    "are discussed in [ sec : mixing ] .",
    "we revisit the s process in non - rotating stars and its dependence on initial metallicity in [ sec : mixing ] .",
    "the impact of rotation on the @xmath0  process in massive stars at different metallicities is discussed in [ sec : boosteds ] .",
    "we compare our models to the literature and observations in [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    ".model parameters : initial mass ( column 1 ) , model label ( 2 ) , initial ratio of surface velocity to critical velocity ( 3 ) , time - averaged surface velocity during the ms phase ( 4 ) , metallicity ( 5 ) , [ fe / h ] ( 6 ) and total lifetime , @xmath15 , from the zams until the advanced phases ( 7 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the sample of 46 cemp  no stars we may collect from the mentioned catalogs @xcite , 39 stars have [ sr / fe ] data measured .",
    "their mean value is [ sr / fe]= -0.36 .",
    "there are 8 cemp  no stars with a significant excess of the ratio [ sr / fe ] , say with [ sr / fe ] @xmath16 . table [ srba ] shows their [ sr / fe ] , [ ba / fe ] and [ sr / ba ] ratios .",
    "we see that all stars in the range of [ fe / h]= -2.2 to -4.0 have clearly _ positive _ values of the [ sr / ba ] ratios , up to more than 2.05 .",
    "the two stars with the lowest [ fe / h ] values , he 0233 - 0343 ( [ fe / h]=-4.68 ) and he 1327 - 2326 ( [ fe / h]=-5.76 ) , both have _ negative _ values of their lower limits for [ sr / ba ] of -0.48 and -0.42 .    there is , for now , only one star known with a [ fe / h ] ratio lower than those quoted above , this is smss 0313 - 6708 @xcite .",
    "its chemical abundances are mainly given in the form of upper limits : [ fe / h]=@xmath17 , [ sr / h]@xmath18 , [ ba / h]@xmath19 .",
    "we notice that these limits may also support a positive [ sr / fe ] together with a negative [ sr / ba ] ratio for this object with an extremely low metallicity , but , since these are only upper limits , it is not possible at the moment to interpret the heavy elements abundances in this star .",
    "despite the fact that the sample of these most extreme objects is limited , we may note an impressive agreement between the model predictions and the observations with the following conclusions .    *",
    "if we consider both models without and with rotation , the ranges of theoretical and observed [ sr / ba ] ratios correspond very well lying between [ sr / ba ] @xmath20 - 0.5 and + 2.0 .",
    "* without the effects of rotation , the predicted range of [ sr / ba ] ratios lies between 0.0 and 0.2 , being much shorter than the observed range .",
    "thus , non  rotating models are unable to account for the observed range of [ sr / ba ] .",
    "* the range of [ sr / ba ] ratios predicted by rotating models is much broader extending from -0.5 to 2.1 , in agreement with observations .",
    "thus rotating models are needed for accounting the abundances of s  elements in very low metallicity stars , as shown in the last reference . * not only the observed range are correctly predicted by the models , but also the observed trend of lower [ sr / ba ] for stars with the lower [ fe / h ] ratios .",
    "we note that this last effect is quite consistent with the so  called `` ba  floor '' recently found by @xcite .",
    "this is a plateau in the absolute ba abundances of cemp stars for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , the existence of this ba ",
    "floor implies that for the lower [ fe / h ] ratios the observed [ ba / fe ] ratios become larger , and thus [ sr / ba ] lower as shown by the present models .",
    "this confirms the many evidences @xcite consistent with a significant role of rotation in stars of low metallicities , an effect with a high impact on the early chemical and spectral evolution of galaxies .",
    "we calculated a large grid of rotating massive star models to determine the impact of rotation on slow neutron captures from solar down to very low metallicities following our previous exploratory studies .",
    "the main results of this study are the following :    * our models show that rotation not only enables the production of primary nitrogen , but also of important quantities of primary @xmath6ne at all metallicities . whereas the neutron source for the @xmath0  process in non - rotating models is secondary , the neutron source is primary in rotating models . * at solar metallicity , rotation - induced mixing increases the weak @xmath0-process production but its impact is modest ( within a factor of 2 ) and the production in rotating models stops at the strontium peak as in standard models . *",
    "as the metallicity decreases , the amount of iron seeds decreases and the iron seeds are the main limitation to the production of heavier elements in rotating models , in which the neutron source is primary .",
    "the decreasing amount of seeds does not prevent the production of heavier elements though . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of seeds means that not only the seeds get depleted but elements in the mass range @xmath22 also get depleted as the production peak shifts to the strontium peak by @xmath23 and elements up to the barium peak are efficiently produced at that metallicity and very low metallicities .",
    "the final [ sr / ba ] ratio that we obtain is covering the range between roughly -0.5 and 2.1 . *",
    "the strong dependence of production of the barium peak on metallicity and initial rotation rate means that our models provide a natural explanation for the observed scatter for the [ sr / ba ] ratio at the low metallicities . *",
    "the general decrease with metallicity of the [ sr / ba ] ratio in our models also matches the decreasing ratio observed in the small current sample of cemp - no stars at extremely low [ fe / h ] . *",
    "although they are challenging to measure , isotopic ratios , for example for magnesium isotopes , have a great potential for constraining stellar models .",
    "there are important uncertainties that affect the results presented in this paper . on the nuclear side ,",
    "the dominant uncertainties are the exit channel ratios between @xmath24 and @xmath25 for alpha captures on @xmath26o and @xmath6ne .",
    "the first ratio determines whether @xmath8o is a strong neutron poison or only a strong absorber , while the second determine the strength of the neutron source @xmath6ne@xmath27 . on the stellar side ,",
    "the interplay of mean molecular weight and magnetic fields with rotation - induced instabilities and mixing is the main uncertainty .",
    "concerning the stabilising effect of mean molecular weight on shear mixing , we have used a conservative prescription for shear mixing .",
    "it is not fully clear yet whether magnetic fields would increase or decrease rotation - induced mixing .",
    "if we compare models computed with the tayler - spruit dynamo and models without , we observed that starting from the same initial conditions ( mass metallicity , rotation ) , models with the tayler - spruit dynamo are more mixed . on the other hand",
    "this does not imply that the models with the tayler - spruit dynamo would produce more primary @xmath5n and @xmath6ne .",
    "primary nitrogen production needs strong enough mixing in a very specific region of the star , i.e. between the helium core and the hydrogen burning shell .",
    "whether this mixing will be strong enough depends on the gradients of the angular velocity and of the mean molecular weight in this region , as explained above in this paper ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "these uncertainties affect quantitatively the results obtained in this study and new models will be required , e.g. when updated reaction rates become available .",
    "nevertheless , the results will remain true qualitatively and their ability to explain many observed abundance features provides a strong support for the impact of rotation - induced mixing at low metallicities .",
