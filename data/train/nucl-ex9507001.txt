    "the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon , labeled @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , are fundamental structure constants that characterize the ability of the constituents of the nucleon to rearrange themselves in response to static or slowly varying external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "these parameters are as fundamental as the charge and magnetic radii of the nucleon , although they have received considerably less attention until fairly recently . with the high present - day interest in qcd - based descriptions of the structure of the nucleon , the additional information represented by an accurate determination of the polarizabilities would be of substantial importance .",
    "this question has motivated considerable activity in recent years on both theoretical and experimental fronts . in this introduction , the experimental situation is reviewed ; a discussion of the theoretical issues is presented in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "measurements of the proton polarizabilities have come exclusively from compton scattering experiments .",
    "these measurements rely on a theorem which establishes a unique relation between the model - independent low - energy expansion ( lex ) of the compton scattering cross section and the polarizabilities . for photon energies",
    "sufficiently low , this expansion in the laboratory frame reads @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the energies of the incident and scattered photons respectively , @xmath8 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath9 is the exact born cross section for a proton with an anomalous magnetic moment but no other structure @xcite .",
    "the lex is an expansion of the cross section to first order in @xmath10 ; besides the anomalous magnetic moment , the only structure - dependent terms to this order are the polarizabilities .",
    "the equation shows that the forward and backward cross sections are sensitive mainly to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , whereas the 90@xmath0 cross section is sensitive only to @xmath1 .",
    "the sum @xmath11 is independently constrained by a model - independent dispersion sum rule @xcite : @xmath13 in units of @xmath14 @xmath15 ( these units are implicitly understood hereafter ) , where @xmath16 is the total photoabsorption cross section on the proton . the numerical value in eq .  [ eq : sumrule ] is obtained using both the available experimental data and a reasonable theoretical _ ansatz _ for extrapolating the integral to infinite energy @xcite .",
    "the polarizabilities are determined by measuring the deviation of the cross sections from the born values .",
    "a plot of the born and lex cross sections is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cross_section_plot ] .",
    "the curves show that the effect of the polarizabilities , which is proportional to the difference between the born and lex curves , is not very large , thereby placing great demand on the statistical precision and systematic accuracy of the measurements in order to obtain precise values for the polarizabilities .",
    "those demands can be relaxed by going to a higher photon energy , since the sensitivity of the cross section to the polarizabilities increases with energy .",
    "however if the energy becomes too large , the lex breaks down and theoretical uncertainty is introduced into the extraction of the polarizabilities from the measured cross sections .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_section_plot ] , where the curve labeled dr is a calculation of the cross section using dispersion relations and is valid , in principle , at all energies .",
    "this curve shows that the lex is not valid above about 100 mev .",
    "since many of the experiments , including the present measurements , have been done at energies outside the range of validity of the lex , it is necessary to pay particular attention to the model dependence in the determination of the polarizabilities from the cross sections .",
    "this issue is discussed at length in section  [ sec : theoretical ] .",
    "the above considerations suggest that the experimental challenge for determining the proton polarizabilities is to measure an _ absolute _ cross section over an energy and angular range that is appropriately balanced between sensitivity to the polarizabilities and insensitivity to any theoretical model . with this in mind , it is useful to examine briefly the previous experiments that have attempted to determine the proton polarizabilities from measurements of the compton scattering cross section @xcite , some of which are summarized in table  [ tab : experiments ] .",
    "the pioneering experiment is that of goldanski @xcite , whose original result ( @xmath17 ) is omitted from the list mainly because the 8% uncertainty in the normalization of the cross sections leads to a systematic uncertainty in @xmath1 of @xmath18 @xcite . also omitted is an earlier compton scattering experiment @xcite with energies , angles , and systematic errors comparable to those of goldanski , although no attempt was made by the author to extract polarizabilities from the cross sections . in both cases",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the polarizabilities is too large to affect the global fit we will report in section  [ sec : extraction ] .",
    "the moscow 1975 experiment @xcite used a bremsstrahlung photon beam and a photon detector with very poor energy resolution .",
    "nevertheless , due to a clever technique that allowed the cross section to be normalized to the well - known klein - nishina cross section for compton scattering on the electron , the systematic errors were thought to be small .",
    "the reported polarizabilities were based on a fit to the cross sections using the lex . since the maximum energy of those cross sections ( 110 mev ) is outside the range of validity of the lex , we have refitted them using the dispersion - relation technique described in section  [ sec : extraction ] , and those results are given in table  [ tab : experiments ] .",
    "unfortunately they are badly inconsistent with the dispersion sum rule , thereby casting doubt on the cross sections and providing the principal motivation for the more recent experiments .    the illinois 1991 experiment @xcite had two very desirable features .",
    "first , it was done at both a forward and backward scattering angle and at low energies , so that model - independent determinations of both @xmath19 ( testing the dispersion sum rule and/or the systematics of the experiment ) and @xmath12 were possible .",
    "second , a tagged photon beam was used , thereby considerably improving the ability to measure absolute cross sections accurately .",
    "unfortunately , the combined effects of low energy ( implying low sensitivity ) and the counting rate limitations inherent in a tagged photon experiment resulted in reduced statistical precision in the extracted polarizabilities .",
    "the mainz 1992 experiment @xcite measured the 180@xmath0 compton cross section by detecting the recoil proton at 0@xmath0 in a magnetic spectrometer , normalizing to the compton cross section on the electron .",
    "the energy , 132 mev , was a good compromise between sensitivity to the polarizabilities and model independence .",
    "the principal drawback of this experiment was that @xmath12 was determined by just a single cross - section measurement at one energy and angle .",
    "the saskatoon 1993 experiment @xcite used a high duty - factor bremsstrahlung photon beam and a high - resolution nai detector to measure an extensive set of angular distributions via the endpoint technique . while the statistical and systematic quality of the data were very good , the energies ( 150300 mev ) were far outside the range of validity of the lex , leading to possibly large uncertainties in the polarizabilities due to model - dependent effects .",
    "we report here new measurements of the compton scattering cross sections and the extraction of improved values for the electric and magnetic polarizabilities from those cross sections .",
    "the measurements utilized a new experimental technique , described in sections  [ sec : experiment ] and [ sec : reduction ] , in which measurements were done simultaneously using tagged photons ( 70100 mev ) and untagged photons ( 100148 mev )",
    ". an important feature of this work is a careful consideration of the model dependence in the extraction of the polarizabilities from the cross sections ; the theoretical background for this discussion is presented in section  [ sec : theoretical ] . in section",
    "[ sec : extraction ] , the actual procedure used to extract the polarizabilities is presented , and the new values derived from both the present experiment and a global fit to all the recent experiments are given .",
    "a brief discussion of the theoretical impact of the results is given in section  [ sec : discussion ] and our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . an extensive account of this work can be found in the ph.d .",
    "dissertation of macgibbon @xcite .",
    "the compton scattering cross section for the proton was measured at the saskatchewan accelerator laboratory ( sal ) using tagged photons with energies from 70 to 100  mev and untagged photons with energies from 100 to 148  mev .",
    "the entire energy region 70148  mev was measured simultaneously .",
    "a high duty - factor ( @xmath2070% ) beam of 148-mev electrons was incident on a 115-@xmath21 m aluminum radiator , creating a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum of photons up to the endpoint .",
    "the electron beam energy was chosen to minimize the background from the @xmath22-decay photons .",
    "the photon beam was collimated so that its diameter was @xmath206  cm at the target position .",
    "approximately 25% of the photon beam was removed by the collimation .",
    "the primary electron beam was bent away from the photon beam by the main tagging magnet and steered into a shielded beam dump by a secondary magnet .",
    "the sal tagger@xcite was used to determine the energy of the tagged photons by momentum analyzing the associated electrons in the tagging magnet and detecting them in a 62-channel scintillator hodoscope in coincidence with the scattered photons . with the electron beam energy of 148  mev ,",
    "the magnetic field was set to tag 70100  mev photons with an average resolution of @xmath200.5  mev for each of the 62 channels .",
    "the total tagged photon flux , integrated over the 62 channels , was approximately @xmath23 sec@xmath24 .",
    "the scattering target was liquid hydrogen .",
    "the target assembly was a closed - loop recirculation system consisting of a two - stage refrigerator , a target flask and reservoir , and transfer tubes .",
    "the 0.25-mm thick mylar target flask was a cylinder 10.16  cm in diameter and @xmath2013  cm long , oriented with the symmetry axis along the beam direction .",
    "after the initial cooldown and liquification , the flask could be remotely emptied or filled in @xmath2020 minutes , thereby facilitating the process of alternating between full - target and empty - target runs .",
    "the flask was contained in an aluminum vacuum chamber ; the detectors were shielded from the photons scattered from the 0.25  mm mylar windows isolating the vacuum chamber from the atmosphere .    by measuring the transmission of photons through the target , its thickness was determined _ in situ_. a tightly collimated beam of 0.661-mev photons from a @xmath25cs source was used . by counting the number of photons transmitted by both the full and empty target and by using the known mass absorption coefficient of hydrogen @xcite",
    ", the target thickness was determined to be @xmath26  cm , or @xmath27 , in agreement with the geometrical measurement .",
    "the photons were detected in two large - volume high - resolution nai(tl ) spectrometers , one each at scattering angles of 90@xmath0 and 135@xmath0 and each subtending a geometrical solid angle of @xmath28 sr .",
    "the nai crystals were surrounded by plastic anti - coincidence shields to reject cosmic rays and other charged particles and by 10.2  cm - thick pb shields to reduce the effects of room background .",
    "the gains of the detectors were monitored during data acquisition and corrected for drifts over the course of the three - week run .",
    "an led was mounted on the back of each nai detector together with an annular silicon surface - barrier detector ( sbd ) , so that both the sbd and the nai were illuminated by photons from the led .",
    "the led was flashed at two different intensities , allowing a monitor of both the gain and offset of each photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and its associated electronics .",
    "the sbd , which was used to monitor and correct the intensity of the led pulses , was determined to be stable to better than 0.5% in bench tests with an @xmath29-particle source .",
    "the corrected gain of each nai was stable to better than 0.4% throughout the course of the experiment .",
    "the overall trigger for the experiment was a signal with an energy above threshold in either of the two nai detectors .",
    "all such events were accepted whether or not they were accompanied by a tagging electron , thereby allowing the acquisition of both tagged and untagged events simultaneously . for each event ,",
    "the adc value for each of the nai pmt s was recorded along with the 62 tdc values corresponding to the time difference between a nai signal and each of the tagging electrons . at 15-second intervals ,",
    "the 62 scalers counting the number of electrons in each tagging channel were read out .",
    "the data were sorted off - line into tagged and untagged events .",
    "a tagged event was defined as one in which the photon was correlated with a tagging electron , and an untagged event was defined as _ any _ photon event .",
    "thus , the tagged events were a _ subset _ of the untagged events .",
    "data were collected by alternating between full - target runs of @xmath30 hours and empty - target runs of @xmath31 hours . at three different times during the experiment , each nai detector was placed directly in the photon beam in order to measure the ratio of the number of photons incident on the target to the number of tagging electrons ( the so - called tagging efficiency ) and to determine the detector response functions ( see section  [ sec : reduction ] ) and energy calibration .",
    "a pb - glass detector was also periodically placed in the photon beam in order to provide a relative monitor of the tagging efficiency , which was determined to be stable to better than @xmath32 throughout the course of the experiment .",
    "since the present technique of simultaneous measurements with tagged and untagged photons is new , it is discussed here in some detail . the technique is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : photon ] and consists of two types of measurements : ( 1 ) a scattering run , which measures the detector pulse - height spectrum for scattered photons normalized to the number of electrons @xmath33 detected in the tagger ; and ( 2 ) a calibration run which is used to normalize @xmath33 to the number of photons incident on the target .",
    "the latter is accomplished by putting the detector directly into the photon beam .",
    "together these measurements are used to determine the scattering cross section .",
    "for both the tagged and untagged data , the scattering cross sections were determined from the detector pulse - height spectrum of scattered photons : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the target thickness , @xmath36 is the detector solid angle , @xmath37 is the incident photon energy , @xmath38 is the pulse height in the detector , and @xmath39 is the endpoint energy .",
    "this expression is the convolution of the bremsstrahlung photon spectrum incident on the target @xmath40 , the scattering cross section @xmath41 , and the detector response function for scattered photons @xmath42 .",
    "this latter quantity is the probability density that a photon of energy @xmath37 incident on the front face of the nai detector will register a pulse height @xmath38 in that detector .",
    ", the scattered photon energy , which differs from the incident energy due to the compton recoil shift . for simplicity of notation , this recoil shift has been absorbed into the response function .",
    "] the detector pulse - height spectrum in a calibration run is used to measure the incident photon flux : @xmath43 where the detector response function in the calibration run @xmath44 differs slightly from that in the scattering run @xmath42 due to the different geometries and the compton recoil shift .      for the tagged - photon measurements ,",
    "each incident tagged - photon energy bin is a 0.5-mev slice of the full bremsstrahlung spectrum , or essentially a @xmath45-function : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the tagged - photon energy and @xmath48 is the number of tagged photons in that bin .",
    "therefore the pulse - height spectrum for a calibration run is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of associated tagging electrons measured with the tagger scalers , and @xmath51 is the tagging efficiency .",
    "this latter quantity is determined experimentally by taking the ratio of the total number of counts in the pulse - height spectrum to @xmath52 .",
    "note that the tagged - photon pulse - height spectrum is a direct measure of the shape of the detector response function in the calibration mode . a typical spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : tagged_brems ] which also shows a monte carlo simulation of the response function using the code egs4@xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement between the calculated and measured response functions for the calibration geometry gives us confidence that egs4 can be used to calculate the detector response for the scattering geometry , where it is not so easily measured .",
    "previous experience with the same detectors at similar photon energies has shown that egs4 _ can _ accurately account for scattering line shapes in experiments where they can be measured with good statistics @xcite .    again using eq .",
    "[ eq : delta ] , the detector pulse - height spectrum for tagged photons in a scattering run is related to the cross section by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of tagging electrons measured with the tagger scalers , and the value of @xmath55 is obtained from the calibration run . the detector response function is again determined using an egs4 simulation , which now also accounts for the effects of the finite geometry on @xmath35 and @xmath36 , as well as the compton recoil shift . for each tagger channel",
    ", cuts are placed on the tdc value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tdc ] ) to obtain separate true - plus - random and random pulse - height spectra . the appropriately normalized random spectrum , which is corrected for rate - dependent losses in the tdc ,",
    "is then subtracted from the true - plus - random one to obtain a true coincidence spectrum , which is then shifted to a common energy and combined with those of adjacent tagger channels into one of four composite spectra , each corresponding to a tagging range of about 8 mev .",
    "this is done separately for the full - target and empty - target data , which are then subtracted to obtain final spectra for scattering from hydrogen .",
    "these spectra are then integrated to obtain @xmath56 . a sample hydrogen scattering spectrum together with a normalized egs4 spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : tagged_h ] .",
    "the resulting tagged - photon cross sections are given in the appendix .",
    "the untagged cross sections were also determined using eqs .",
    "[ eq : int_scatt ] and [ eq : int_calib ] . to simplify the notation ,",
    "the incident photon spectrum is expressed as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total number of incident photons with energy in the interval between @xmath59=100 mev and the endpoint energy @xmath39 , @xmath60 is the spectrum shape that is normalized to unit area over the same energy interval , and @xmath61 is the ratio of @xmath58 to the number of electrons measured by the tagger scalers .",
    "thus for the untagged analysis , the tagger is only used to normalize the number of photons in a calibration run to that in a scattering run . the pulse - height spectrum in a calibration run",

    "[ eq : int_calib ] ) now takes the form @xmath62 the quantity @xmath61 is determined by normalizing the calibration pulse - height spectrum to a calculated spectrum . in the calculation , the detector response function is again determined using egs4 , and the shape @xmath60 is taken to be the schiff bremsstrahlung spectrum @xcite , which is differential in both energy and angle . the resulting normalized spectrum for one of the detectors",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : untagged_brems ] along with the data .",
    "it was verified that the cross sections derived from this technique are insensitive to the exact form of @xmath60 .",
    "the cross sections are found by fitting the scattering pulse - height spectrum to the expression ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : int_scatt ] ) : @xmath63 using a simple parametrization of the cross section : @xmath64 the s@xmath65 were allowed to vary freely to obtain the best fit to the final scattering spectrum ( with empty - target subtracted ) over the energy range corresponding to incident photons between 100 mev and the endpoint energy .",
    "these parameters have a high degree of anti - correlation between adjacent values due to the low - energy tail on the detector response function ; therefore it was necessary to employ the full error matrix when using these cross sections to extract physical quantities .",
    "the scattering spectra and the associated fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : untagged_h ] .",
    "the resulting untagged cross sections and associated errors are given in the appendix .",
    "it is noted that since the tagged data are a subset of the untagged data , the minimum incident energy for which untagged results are quoted ( 100  mev ) is the maximum energy for which we have tagged results .",
    "thus the same photon event is not counted as both tagged and untagged . however , as a check of our technique , we investigated the overall consistency between the tagged and untagged cross sections by extending the calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : untagged_h ] into the tagging region using the tagged cross sections given in the appendix . at 135@xmath0",
    "there is good consistency .",
    "however , at 90@xmath0 the curve is consistently below the data , indicating that those data are contaminated with non - compton events from the target , such as @xmath22-decay photons , whose kinematic endpoint is just below the maximum tagging energy of 100 mev , or pair production followed by bremsstrahlung .",
    "this is not a problem for energies above the tagging region .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainty for the cross sections is @xmath662.9% for the untagged data and ranges from @xmath67% to @xmath68% for the tagged data .",
    "typical contributions include the uncertainties in the detector solid angle ( @xmath661.2% ) , target thickness ( @xmath661.2% ) , tagging efficiency ( @xmath6612% ) , and rate - dependent corrections ( @xmath6613% ) .",
    "a complete discussion of these errors and the details of the experimental procedure and data reduction have been given by macgibbon @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the different systematic errors had various degrees of correlation among the different cross sections ( e.g. , the error due to the target thickness was correlated among all the cross sections , while that due to the solid angle of the 135@xmath0 detector was correlated only among the 135@xmath0 cross sections ) .",
    "the effect of these correlations was properly taken into account when extracting the polarizabilities .",
    "since much of the data in the current experiment lie outside the range of validity of the lex , it is necessary to address the issue of how to extract the polarizabilities from the cross sections and the model dependence therein . in this section , a theoretical overview of the dispersion - relation approach utilized here",
    "is presented .",
    "this approach , as well as the computer code used for the numerical work , are due to lvov @xcite .",
    "a more complete description will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "all compton scattering observables are determined from six independent invariant amplitudes , @xmath69 , which are free of kinematical singularities and constraints and are even functions of @xmath70 .",
    "here @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the usual mandelstam variables and @xmath74 is the proton mass . these amplitudes incorporate different mechanisms for compton scattering , including @xmath71- , @xmath73- , and @xmath72-channel exchanges of stable particles ( see diagrams in fig .  [ fig : diagrams ] ) .",
    "the @xmath71- and @xmath73-channel processes are sums over all possible intermediate states that can be formed in the photon - proton interaction , such as nucleon resonances , non - resonant @xmath75-nucleon states , etc . for the special case where the intermediate state is a proton in the ground state , the so - called born amplitude , @xmath76 ,",
    "is obtained .",
    "this purely real amplitude is calculated exactly in terms of the charge , mass , and magnetic moment of the proton ; the cross section based on the @xmath76 alone is shown in fig .  [",

    "all other diagrams , including the @xmath72-channel exchanges , contribute to the non - born part , @xmath77 . at low energies ,",

    "therefore , provided the dispersion relations are valid , a complete knowledge of the multipole amplitudes at all energies uniquely determines the scattering cross section and therefore the polarizabilities .",
    "however for some of the amplitudes an unsubtracted dispersion relation is _ not valid _ because the integral does not converge .",
    "this is largely due to the @xmath72-channel processes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diagrams ] ) , which give rise to amplitudes that do not fall rapidly enough with energy to assure convergence of the integral .",

    "it expresses the real part of the invariant amplitude as a sum of a born part which is calculated exactly , an integral part which is determined by the photoabsorption multipole amplitudes , and an asymptotic part .",
    "the integral and asymptotic contributions are now discussed separately .",
    "the integral part is discussed first .",
    "as mentioned above , unitarity relates im@xmath89 $ ] to the multipole amplitudes for the total photoabsorption cross section on the proton . for compton scattering near and below the pion threshold ,",
    "the most important intermediate states contributing to the dispersion integrals are the @xmath90 states ( including nucleon resonances that decay into the @xmath90 channel ) , which have both the largest cross section and the largest energy weighting . for this contribution , im@xmath89 $ ]",
    "is a sum of bilinear combinations of single - pion photoproduction multipole amplitudes , the most important of which have been very well measured and tabulated @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath90 contribution to the dispersion integrals can be reliably calculated , and the sensitivity of the scattering cross section to experimental uncertainties in the @xmath90 multipoles can be readily determined .",
    "on the other hand , the multipole amplitudes for multi - pion photoproduction , which dominates the photoabsorption cross section for energies greater than @xmath20 600 mev , are poorly known experimentally and therefore can only be treated in the context of a model .",
    "fortunately , for photon scattering energies below 150 mev , the multi - pion contribution to the dispersion integrals is suppressed because of the large energy denominator , so it is expected that the predicted scattering cross sections will only weakly depend on the model assumptions .",
    "approximately 40% of the multi - pion cross section proceeds either through known resonances or through the @xmath91 channel , and these contributions can be reliably decomposed into multipoles .",
    "the non - resonant cross section is partly due to @xmath92 production . for partial waves @xmath93",
    ", the multipole amplitudes for this process are calculated in the born approximation , assuming a one - pion - exchange mechanism .",
    "the remaining multi - pion cross section , hereafter referred to as the non - resonant s - wave contribution , is ascribed some combination of low - order multipoles , leading to non - resonant intermediate states with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , or @xmath96 , and then scaled so that the calculated total multi - pion contribution to the photoabsorption reproduces the experimental value at each energy .",
    "the sensitivity of the scattering cross section to the model can be tested by adjusting the combination of multipoles making up the non - resonant s - wave contribution .",
    "the asymptotic part is discussed next .",
    "using regge theory , lvov shows @xcite that for @xmath9735 , @xmath98 drops sufficiently rapidly at high @xmath82 and fixed @xmath72 to assure negligible contribution of @xmath87 for @xmath83 = 1.5 gev .",
    "however , both @xmath99 and @xmath100 and to a lesser extent @xmath101 have important contributions due to @xmath72-channel exchanges , so that the asymptotic part can not be neglected . for @xmath102 ,",

    "nevertheless , for the low @xmath72 of the scattering data considered here ( @xmath112 gev@xmath113 ) , the amplitude is completely dominated by the lowest - mass exchanged particle , and the effect of higher - mass exchanges can be absorbed into the form factor @xmath109 .",

    "the leading exchange is that due to a correlated pair of pions in a 0@xmath119 isoscalar state , for which the mass and the couplings are poorly known . for low @xmath72 , it is convenient to express @xmath120 in the alternate form @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "the net result is that each data set is properly weighted based on its systematic error , taking full account of the correlations in those systematic errors , and the uncertainties in the fitted parameters ( i.e. , the polarizabilities ) include contributions from both the statistical and the systematic errors . the purely statistical contribution to those uncertainties can be determined by fitting with fixed values for the normalization constants .",
    "the net systematic contribution is derived by assuming the total uncertainty is the result of combining in quadrature the statistical and systematic contributions . a detailed discussion of this technique is given by macgibbon @xcite .",

    "the sensitivity to the model assumptions in the calculation of the multi - pion multipole amplitudes was studied by adjusting the multipole composition of the non - resonant s - wave contribution .",
    "the sensitivity to the product of coupling constants for the @xmath22 exchange amplitude ( @xmath155 ) was studied by varying the product within the range of its experimental uncertainty , @xmath114 .",
    "finally , the sensitivity to each of the three parameters describing the @xmath72-dependence of the asymptotic amplitudes was studied by varying them within the ranges @xmath116=03 , b@xmath156=610 , and @xmath134=610 gev@xmath117 .",
    "each of the model parameters in table  [ tab : modeldep ] was then chosen to give results for the polarizabilities midway between the extreme values .",
    "the cross sections were fitted using these parameters in order to obtain final results .",
    "the total model uncertainty was taken to be the combination - in - quadrature of the numbers in table  [ tab : modeldep ] .",

    "as noted in table  [ tab : modeldep ] , if the individual contributions to the model - dependent errors are combined linearly rather than in quadrature , then the model - dependent errors on @xmath143 and @xmath159 become 2.0 and 0.7 , respectively .",

    "it is evident that there is excellent overall consistency among all but the moscow 1975 experiment @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , it was the inconsistency between that experiment and the sum rule that motivated the more recent experiments .",
    "the inconsistency can be traced to their 150@xmath0 cross sections , which lead to a value of @xmath12 that strongly disagrees with the other experiments .",
    "on the other hand , their 90@xmath0 cross sections essentially determine @xmath1 , which appears to be consistent with the other experiments .",

    "the dispersion cross sections were used to fit the remaining three data sets without the sum - rule constraint , taking into account the systematic errors and estimating the model uncertainty as described earlier .",
    "global - average values for the polarizabilities are thus found : @xmath165 and @xmath166 where the first error is the combined statistical and systematic error propagated from the individual cross sections and the second is the model - dependent error derived in the manner described above .",
    "once again , if the individual contributions to the model - dependent error are combined linearly , then the model - dependent errors approximately double .",
    "if instead the sum - rule constraint is applied to the global fit , the same value and error for @xmath12 is found .",

    "fig : ellipse ] .",
    "in recent years , various theoretical approaches have been used to calculate the polarizabilities of the nucleon , including non - relativistic quark models , bag models , chiral quark models , chiral perturbation theory , soliton models , and dispersion relations .",
    "an excellent review has been given by lvov @xcite .",
    "here we elaborate on the dispersion - relation approach , which allows sum rules to be established for the polarizabilities .",
    "these sum rules are completely rigorous yet semi - phenomenological , since they relate the polarizabilities to features of the photoabsorption cross section .",
    "this is physically appealing , since it helps identify the physics that gives rise to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , such as the contribution of a particular nucleon resonance .    in the context of the fixed-@xmath72 dispersion relations that were used to extract the polarizabilities from the compton scattering data , two sum rules",
    "have already been presented : eq .",
    "[ eq : sumrules ] for @xmath19 and eq .",
    "[ eq : sumruled ] for @xmath12 .",
    "it is illuminating to combine the two sum rules to obtain sum rules for @xmath1 and @xmath2 separately , each of which can be written as a sum of an integral part and an asymptotic part : @xmath169 the integral part can be directly evaluated using the single - pion multipole amplitudes and the model for the multi - pion multipole amplitudes . the asymptotic part is just the difference between the measured polarizability and the integral part .",
    "the values thus obtained are @xmath170    we first comment on the integral parts , the integrands for which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : integrand ] . for @xmath171 the integral is dominated by multipoles involving non - resonant pion photoproduction , except for a negative contribution ( @xmath172 ) which comes from the excitation of the @xmath173 resonance .",
    "otherwise , there is apparently very little contribution from degrees of freedom associated with excitations of the valence quarks .",
    "indeed , a qualitative calculation in the context of the chiral bag model @xcite shows that both the electric polarizability and the diamagnetic part of the magnetic polarizability are dominated by the polarization of the pion cloud relative to the quark core and have little to do with the polarization of the core itself .",
    "this notion is confirmed by calculations using chiral perturbation theory at the one - loop order @xcite .",
    "for @xmath174 the integral is dominated by the @xmath173 resonance @xcite .",
    "we next comment on the asymptotic parts of the polarizabilities , which are neither small nor well constrained by the photoabsorption cross section .",
    "indeed , the combination @xmath12 is almost entirely due to the asymptotic contributions . as discussed in section  [ sec : theoretical ] , these asymptotic contributions arise primarily from the @xmath72-channel exchange of a correlated pair of pions in a relative @xmath175 state . in effect",
    ", it arises from the scattering from the pion cloud surrounding the nucleon .",
    "however , as pointed out by lvov @xcite , the born part of the scattering from the pion cloud is already largely contained in the integral contribution , so it is primarily the non - born part that enters into the asymptotic amplitude .",
    "this idea receives support from an alternate sum - rule approach based on a backward dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "there is a close correspondence between the asymptotic contribution to the fixed-@xmath72 sum rule and the @xmath72-channel contribution to the backward sum rule , the latter involving the physical amplitudes for the process @xmath129 .",
    "a substantial contribution to the @xmath72-channel integral is due to the non - born part of @xmath176 , which is essentially due to pionic structure , including ( but not limited to ) the polarizability of the pion itself .",
    "this leads to the interesting possibility that a major contribution to the polarizability of the nucleon is due to the internal structure of the pions .",
    "since the energy needed to excite the pion is large , this suggests that much of the physics of the nucleon polarizability is the physics of energies beyond 1 gev . any qcd - based structure model that attempts to calculate the polarizabilities will need to address this physics",
    "the compton scattering cross section on the proton has been measured in the energy range 70148 mev , using both tagged and untagged photons . with the aid of fixed-@xmath72 dispersion relations , new values for the electric and magnetic polarizabilities have been determined from these cross sections and the model - dependent uncertainty has been estimated .",
    "the present results have been combined with previously published compton scattering cross sections below pion threshold in order to obtain global - average values for the polarizabilities .",
    "dispersion relations indicate that the polarizabilities are only partially constrained by existing photoproduction data and that a substantial part is due to physics beyond 1 gev , such as pionic structure .",
