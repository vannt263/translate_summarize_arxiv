    "in 1986 , b. paczyski ( @xcite ) proposed to use gravitational microlensing as a tool to probe the dark matter of the galactic halo . a few years later , several experiments started looking for microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud ( ) .",
    "several candidates have now been observed by the  and  collaborations ( @xcite , alcock et al .",
    "1997a , @xcite ) .",
    "the first results towards the  suggested an optical depth of order half that required to account for the dynamical mass of the dark halo , and the typical einstein radius crossing time of the events implied a mass of about 0.5  m@xmath3 for the lenses ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the  photographic plates microlensing survey pointed to a somewhat lower optical depth ( ansari et al .",
    "such objects can not be main - sequence stars , whose observed density is two orders of magnitude too low to account for the measured optical depth .",
    "many hypotheses have been debated regarding the nature and location of these lenses , as lmc self - lensing ( @xcite ) , tidal debris ( @xcite ) , intervening populations ( zaritsky & lin 1997 ) , a warped galactic disk ( evans et al .",
    "1998 ) , white dwarfs ( adams & laughlin 1996 , graff et al . 1998 ) , primordial black holes ( jedamzik 1998 ) , all of which have brought forth numerous counter - arguments ( gould 1995 , alcock et al . 1997b , gould 1998 , bennett 1998 , beaulieu & sackett 1998 ) .",
    "no fully satisfactory possibility has emerged , the main two trends being 0.5  m@xmath3 dark objects in the halo , such as primordial black holes , or 0.1  m@xmath3 main sequence stars near the  itself .",
    "the cosmological implications of these two hypotheses differ considerably .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( ) is highly valuable as a second target for halo microlensing searches .",
    "if the lenses belong to the halo of our galaxy , the optical depth and the distribution of event durations should be similar to the ones observed towards the . in the case of  or  self - lensing ,",
    "however , the different dynamical properties of the two clouds will give rise to differences in optical depth and event duration .",
    "eros , whose setup was upgraded in 1996 , is engaged in observations towards the  and the .",
    "the analysis of the first year of observations towards the  yielded one event ( palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "1998 , alcock et al 1997c ) . a second event , whose source star was too faint to be in the  reference catalog , was alerted on by  and actively monitored by all microlensing collaborations .",
    "it was generated by a binary deflector most probably located in the  itself ( @xcite , albrow et al . 1999 , alcock et al .",
    "1999 , rhie et al . 1999 ,",
    "udalski et al .",
    "this light curve , however , is not counted as an event in the following analysis which only uses stars identified on our template images , for which the efficiency can be estimated .",
    "we present here the details of the  2 two - year analysis of data towards the and discuss its implications for the nature of the halo dark matter .",
    "the telescope , camera , telescope operations and data reduction are as described in palanque - delabrouille  1998 and references therein .",
    "ten square degrees are monitored on the .",
    "note that since one ccd of the red camera was non functional , all the analysis is done on only 7 ccd s (  a total field of 8.6 square degrees ) .",
    "the two - year data set contains 5.3 million light curves covering the period from july 1996 to march 1998 .",
    "the analysis of the two - year data set is similar to that of the first year ( palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "the major difference comes from the addition of rejection cuts requiring a minimum time coverage of the event ( not possible with the previous one - year time span ) , and from the tuning of some cuts applied to parameters with a clear field - dependent distribution .",
    "the criteria are sufficiently loose not to reject light curves deformed by blending or by the finite size of the source , or events involving multiple lenses or sources .",
    "most variable stars are rejected by at least two distinct cuts .",
    "as in the first year analysis , we define a positive ( negative ) fluctuation as a series of data points that ( i ) starts by one point deviating by at least @xmath4 from the baseline flux @xmath5 , ( ii ) stops with at least three consecutive points below @xmath6 ( above @xmath7 ) and ( iii ) contains at least 4 points above @xmath6 ( below @xmath8 ) .",
    "the significance @xmath9 of a given variation is defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the deviation in @xmath12 s of the point taken at time @xmath13 and @xmath14 the number of points within the fluctuation .",
    "we order the fluctuations along a light curve by decreasing significance .",
    "the cuts are described hereafter : + * selection of microlensing candidates : *    * * 1a : * the main fluctuation detected in the red and blue light curves should be positive and occur simultaneously in the two colors : if i is the time interval during which the data are more than @xmath4 away from the baseline flux , we require @xmath15 . * * 1b : * to reject flat light curves with only statistical fluctuations , we require that on a given light curve + @xmath16 + in both colors .",
    "* * 1c : * we require that @xmath17 in both colors .",
    "* rejection of variable stars : *    * * 2a : * to exclude short period variable stars that exhibit irregular light curves , we require that the rms of the distribution of the deviation , in @xmath12 s , of each flux measurement from the linear interpolation between its two neighboring data points be small , typically less than 2.2 ( the exact value varying from field to field , with a looser limit set on outer fields ) . *",
    "* 2b : * to exclude variable stars which exhibit correlated fluctuations between the two colors , we calculate the correlation coefficient @xmath18 between the `` red '' and the `` blue '' light curves , excluding points in the main fluctuation ( enlarged by a 25% time margin on either side ) so as to consider only the un - amplified part of the light curve .",
    "the cut is applied to @xmath19 whose distribution is less sensitive than @xmath18 to the number of points @xmath20 .",
    "we require @xmath21 .",
    "* * 2c : * we remove two under - populated regions of the color - magnitude diagram that contain a large fraction of variable stars ( upper main sequence and bright red giants , see details in first year analysis ) .",
    "* s / n improvement of the set of selected candidates : *    * * 3a : * we remove events with low signal - to - noise ratio by requiring a significant improvement of a microlensing fit ( ml ) over a constant flux fit ( cst ) , i.e. that + @xmath22/[\\chi^2({\\rm ml})/{\\rm d.o.f . } ] > \\delta \\chi^2_{\\rm min}$ ] + where d.o.f . is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "as for cut 2a , the exact value of @xmath23 varies from field to field because of the variations in time sampling .",
    "typically , @xmath24 , with a higher limit on well - sampled fields . *",
    "* 3b : * we require that the maximum magnification in the microlensing fit be greater than 1.40 .",
    "* time coverage of the event : *    * * 4a : * we require that the fitted time of maximum magnification be contained in the period of observation . *",
    "* 4b : * we require that the fitted value of the einstein radius crossing time @xmath25 days .",
    "* physical blending : *    * * 5 : * if blending significantly improves the microlensing fit , then the fitted blending should be physical , : if @xmath26 , we require that the fitted blending fraction @xmath27 , in both colors",
    ".    the tuning of each cut and the estimation of the efficiency of the analysis ( with the correction due to blending ) is done with monte carlo simulated light curves , as described in palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "the microlensing parameters are drawn uniformly in the following intervals : time of maximum magnification @xmath28 $ ] days , impact parameter normalized to the einstein radius @xmath29 $ ] and time - scale @xmath30 $ ] days .",
    "cuts 2a and 3a are tuned individually on each field so as to reject respectively @xmath31  15% and @xmath31  25% of the remaining monte carlo light curves .",
    "the impact of each cut on data and simulated events is summarized in table  1 .",
    ".impact of each cut on data and simulated microlensing events ( allowing for blending ) .",
    "each fraction for cut @xmath32 refers to the light curves remaining after cut @xmath33 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to set limits on the contribution of dark objects to the halo , a halo model must be used to obtain , for a given deflector mass , both a number of expected events and a distribution of event durations .",
    "we use the so - called `` standard '' halo model described in palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "1998 as model 1 , and take into account the efficiency of the analysis given in the previous section .",
    "moreover , to set conservative limits , we have assumed that the observed event is a halo event , in spite of the fact that it is most probably an  self - lensing event ( palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "assuming a standard halo model with a mass fraction @xmath34 composed of dark compact objects having a single mass @xmath35 , the likelihood of observing at most one event , with a duration less probable than the observed one ( @xmath36 ) , is @xmath37with @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the two durations with the same probability as @xmath36 , defined by : @xmath41@xmath42 is the distribution of expected event durations , taking efficiencies into account , and @xmath43 is the expected number of events .",
    "figure [ excl ] shows the 95  % exclusion limit derived from this likelihood function on @xmath34 , the halo mass fraction , at any given mass @xmath35 ,  assuming all deflectors in the halo have mass @xmath35 .",
    "for comparison , the exclusion curve obtained considering that the sole event detected does not belong to the halo ( thin dashed line on the plot ) is also shown .",
    "the limit is very similar to the one event one , since the very long duration of the event pushes it towards large masses , where our efficiency starts to drop .",
    "the analysis of two years of  2  data has yielded a single microlensing event .",
    "this allows us to put new constraints on the fraction of the halo made of objects in the range [ @xmath44 , @xmath45 , excluding in particular at the 95  % c.l . that more than 50  % of the standard halo be made of @xmath46 objects .",
    "one should also note that all the microlensing events towards the  and the  for which information could be obtained on the deflector location  through parallax for this 97-smc-1 event ( palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "1998 ) , and deflector binarity for 98-smc-1 and lmc-9 ( but see the discussion in bennett et al . 1996 )  seem to be produced by deflectors located in the clouds themselves .",
    "this suggests that self - lensing may be the dominant source of the observed events .",
    "we are continuing to accumulate data towards the  and  in order to determine definitively the location of the deflectors .",

    "we are also grateful for the support given to our project by the technical staff at eso , la silla .",
