    "bernoulli convolutions in turn generalize cantor measures . for over a decade , it has been known that a subclass of ifs measures @xmath0 have associated fourier bases for @xmath2 @xcite . if @xmath2 does have a fourier onb with fourier frequencies @xmath9 , we then say that @xmath10 is a * spectral pair*. in the case that a set of fourier frequencies exist for @xmath2 , we say @xmath6 is a fourier * dual * set for @xmath0 or that @xmath6 is a * spectrum * for @xmath0 ; we say @xmath0 is a * spectral measure*. the goal of this paper is to examine the operator @xmath5 which scales one spectrum into another spectrum .",

    "for example , when the scaling factor is @xmath13that is , @xmath14 is the cantor - bernoulli measure for the omitted third cantor set construction ",

    ", there is no fourier series representation in @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , there can be at most two orthogonal fourier frequencies in @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "but if we modify the cantor - bernoulli construction , using scale @xmath3 , as opposed to @xmath13 , then the authors of @xcite proved that a fourier basis does exist in @xmath4 .",
    "they showed much more : _ each _ of the cantor - bernoulli measures @xmath16 with @xmath17 has a fourier basis .",
    "for each of these measures , there is a canonical choice for a fourier dual set @xmath6 .",
    "we consider here a particular additional symmetry relation for the subclass of cantor - bernoulli measures that form spectral pairs . starting with a spectral pair @xmath10",
