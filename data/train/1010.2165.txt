    "it has been nearly a century since albert einstein s profound physical insight revealed our current standard model of gravitational physics , general relativity . among the theory",
    "s extraordinary consequences was the predicted existence of black holes , nonlinearly self - gravitating , stable objects in which gravitational forces have completely overcome all other physical interactions .",
    "though once considered a mathematical curiosity , general relativity s description of black holes now provides the best explanation for a widespread class of astrophysical objects whose gravitational potential wells power many of the most energetic astronomical phenomena observed .",
    "these range from stellar black - holes powering x - ray sources in the neighboring regions of our galaxy , to supermassive monsters with masses @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the sun , with far - reaching astrophysical consequences .      in the coming decade ,",
    "anticipated observations of gravitational waves from black hole binaries will open a new window onto the universe . interpreting such observations will richly engage aspects of our theoretical understanding of strong - field gravity which have never before been confronted with empirical observations .",
    "the final coalescence of binaries consisting of two comparable - mass black - holes , with mass ratios @xmath2 , is expected to be one of the strongest astrophysical sources of energy the form of gravitational radiation . as the emission of gravitational waves removes energy and momentum from the binary ,",
    "the orbits shrink and the black holes eventually merge together into a single black hole , producing an intense burst of radiation . with the advent of ground - based gravitational wave detectors such as ligo and virgo ( which will detect mergers of black holes with masses in the range @xmath3 ) , and with planning underway for the space - based lisa ( which will observe mergers of massive black holes , with masses @xmath4 ) , knowledge of black - hole binary gravitational waveforms is urgent .",
    "black - hole binary coalescence can be thought of as proceeding in three stages . during the inspiral",
    "the holes have wide enough separations that they can be treated as point particles . in this stage ,",
    "the orbital period is much shorter than the timescale on which the orbital parameters change , and the holes spiral together on quasi - circular orbits .",
    "when the holes get so close together that they can no longer be approximated as point particles , they enter the merger phase . in this strong - field , dynamical regime",
    ", the black holes plunge together and merge into a single , highly distorted black hole , surrounded by a common horizon .",
    "this remnant black hole then `` rings down , '' shedding its nonaxisymmetric modes through gravitational wave emission and settling down into a quiescent rotating black hole",
    ".      knowledge of the gravitational waveforms from these three stages of black hole coalescence is important for gravitational wave detection and data analysis , as well as astrophysical applications .",
    "the inspiral can be calculated analytically using the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation , which is an expansion of the full equations of general relativity in powers of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the characteristic velocity of the source , @xmath7 is its mass , and @xmath8 is its characteristic size . the inspiral gravitational waveform is a `` chirp '' , which is a sinusoid increasing in both frequency and amplitude .",
    "the ringdown can also be calculated analytically using techniques of black - hole perturbation theory , and the resulting gravitational waveforms are damped sinusoids .",
    "however , the merger stage can only be understood using full numerical simulations of the einstein equations in 3-d , and the resulting gravitational waveforms were unknown  until recently .",
    "the final merger of comparable - mass black holes is a powerful source of gravitational radiation .",
    "the gravitational waveforms emitted by a black - hole binary with mass ratio @xmath9 scale with the total mass @xmath7 of the binary . setting @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we can express both length and time scales in terms of the total mass : @xmath12 . the strong - field merger will produce a burst of gravitational radiation lasting @xmath13 and having a luminosity @xmath14 , which is greater than the combined luminosities of all the stars in the visible universe . for stellar black - hole binaries ( @xmath15 ) this luminosity will last for @xmath16 ms , and for massive black - hole binaries ( @xmath17 ) , for @xmath18 min .",
    "understanding the final merger of a black - hole binary requires solving the full einstein equations using the methods of numerical relativity .",
    "this endeavor has proved to have many challenging aspects , ranging from providing astrophysically relevant initial data to understanding the structure of the einstein equations , and the solution eluded researchers for many years .",
    "recently , a series of dramatic breakthroughs has ignited the field , making robust , stable , and accurate simulations of binary mergers possible for the first time .",
    "these models are opening our understanding of strong - field dynamics , impacting gravitational wave searches and other areas of astrophysics . in this article",
    "we provide an overview of these exciting developments , highlighting the key physical results that are emerging .",
    "computing the strong - field merger of two comparable - mass black holes has a long history , with the first attempt dating back more than 40 years .",
    "overall , progress was generally slow and incremental , requiring the interplay among new ideas in black hole modeling , mathematical investigations into the structure of the einstein equations , the development of effective gauge conditions , advances in computational techniques , and the availability of high performance computing resources . here",
    "we provide a brief review of key developments in this arena .      solving einstein s equations on a computer",
    "typically requires slicing 4-d spacetime into a stack of 3-d spacelike hypersurfaces , each labeled by time @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the einstein equations then divide into two sets : constraint and evolution equations .",
    "the constraints are a set of time - independent elliptical equations that must hold on each slice .",
    "in particular , the constraints are solved first to obtain valid initial data for a black - hole binary simulation .",
    "this data is then propagated forward in time using the evolution equations .",
    "general relativity has four spacetime coordinate degrees of freedom , which are associated with four freely - specifiable coordinate or gauge functions that govern the future development of both time and the spatial coordinates .",
    "these are generally taken to be the lapse function @xmath20 , which gives the lapse of proper time @xmath21 between neighboring slices , and the shift vector @xmath22 , which determines how the spatial coordinates develop from one slice to the next .",
    "appropriate choices for the lapse and shift have proven to be crucial for successful black hole evolutions @xcite .      for many years , a primary challenge of numerical relativity was simply to decide which equations to solve @xcite .",
    "there is no unique formulation of the einstein equations ; rather there are many choices regarding , for example , which variables to use , whether to write the equations as first - order or second - order in time , and which coordinate conditions to impose .",
    "these choices are not arbitrary because some formulations turn out to be more `` numerically friendly '' than others .",
    "that is , although they are analytically equivalent when constraints and auxiliary variable definitions are assumed exact , some formulations may be unstable in practice .",
    "for example , the evolution equations may admit rapidly growing solutions which violate the constraints . in this case , although the initial data may contain only tiny errors , the subsequent evolution may produce violations of einstein s equations which `` blow - up '' .",
    "there can also be pathological numerical solutions that do nt represent solutions to the analytic evolution equations at all , but are supported by the discrete numerical grid structure and depend on the details of the finite - differencing operators .",
    "once a formulation has been chosen , the einstein equations are solved numerically for various field variables on a grid of discrete points that represents the spacetime domain of interest .",
    "there are two general approaches for dealing with the spatial derivatives that appear in these equations .",
    "finite differencing interpolates the derivative at a given point from the surrounding points according to a taylor expansion in the grid spacing .",
    "spectral methods assume a solution in the form of a summation of orthogonal functions ; once the coefficients are obtained numerically , the derivatives can be found analytically . in both cases ,",
    "time integration can be handled in a number of ways , most commonly by a runge - kutta algorithm . to date , most numerical relativity solutions have been carried out using finite differencing , with most current work employing a cartesian grid in three spatial dimensions , although results from evolutions using spectral methods are now becoming available .      to model astrophysical binaries ,",
    "initial data must be generated for two black holes moving on quasicircular inspiralling orbits and having a mass - ratio @xmath9 and some configuration of spins .",
    "one usually conceptualizes the initial state of the system with a particle - like description of the masses , positions , momenta , and spins of each black hole . since",
    "general relativity is a field theory , such a description can only be seen as a first step .",
    "the model requires a full description for the initial field configuration which satisfies general relativity s four initial value constraints , and which somehow corresponds to the system we have described in these particle - like terms .",
    "this system is evolved for several orbits and then through plunge , merger , and ringdown , for a total duration on the order of several hundred @xmath7 or more . to obtain the gravitational waveforms ,",
    "the radiation must be extracted from the simulation at large enough distances from the source to be in the `` wave zone '' .",
    "since the length scales of the black holes are @xmath23 and the wavelengths of the emitted radiation are @xmath24 , it is clear that some sort of variable resolution such as adaptive mesh refinement must be used to handle the very large computational domains needed .      by the late 1990 s numerical relativity",
    "had developed to the point that brief simulations of black - hole binaries in three spatial dimensions plus time were possible .",
    "these techniques were sufficient for evolving promptly merging `` grazing collisions '' of black holes  @xcite .",
    "the simulations were not indefinitely stable , but rather would typically crash after @xmath25 , well before any significant portion of a binary orbit could be evolved .",
    "in this arena , the lazarus method emerged as a novel approach to obtaining black - hole binary waveforms , combining short numerical relativity simulations with black hole perturbation methods @xcite . since",
    "numerical relativity codes were then only able to evolve for a brief period , and since perturbation theory could approximate the late time dynamics of the distorted remnant black hole , the lazarus project aimed to apply numerical relativity to evolve the strong - field approach to merger , thereby providing a hybrid model for a significant part of the problem .",
    "starting from quasi - circular initial configurations near the start of the final merger , the black holes were evolved using numerical relativity for @xmath26 until just before the simulation became inaccurate .",
    "then , via a complicated interface , data from late in the numerical simulations was interpreted as initial data describing the perturbed final black hole and the emerging radiation .",
    "finally , black hole perturbation theory techniques were applied to evolve this data and derive the full waveforms .",
    "the lazarus simulations gave the first indication of what might be expected for the terminal burst of radiation from coalescing black - hole binaries .",
    "figure  [ fig1_lazaruswf ] shows that the dominant @xmath27 spin-(-2)-weighted spherical harmonic component has a brief burst of radiation smoothly joining the damped sinusoidal signal of the ringdown .",
    "the waveforms were remarkable for their simplicity , with predominantly circular polarization ( in the @xmath28 mode ) , and a steady evolution of polarization frequency and amplitude .",
    "since these characteristics were robust under variations in the model , it was conjectured that the waveforms from a binary starting from a wide separation late in the inspiral would be well characterized by these simple features .",
    "subsequently , the lazarus method was applied to study mergers of more generic black - hole binaries @xcite .",
    "concurrently with the lazarus investigations , further progress was being made toward full numerical relativity simulations of black - hole binary mergers .",
    "one major milestone was the development of a conformal formulation of the einstein equations known as the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura or `` bssn '' system @xcite , that overcame some instability problems associated with an earlier formulation in use at the time @xcite . in this approach , the set of evolution equations",
    "is written with first - order time derivatives and second - order spatial derivatives , and is strongly hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "stable time evolution was accomplished using a coordinate condition that evolves the lapse function dynamically , causing the slices to avoid crashing into the black hole singularities @xcite .",
    "however the simulations were still limited to durations @xmath29 of stable evolution , by a failure of the spatial coordinate system known as `` grid stretching , '' in which the coordinates tend to fall into the black holes , and by instabilities related to how the black holes were handled numerically .      eliminating grid - stretching required developing appropriate techniques for dynamically controlling the spatial coordinates , which are governed by the evolution of the shift vector .",
    "the first long - lasting evolutions of distorted black holes relied on a class of hyperbolic shift evolution schemes , known as @xmath30-freezing conditions , which were inspired by the bssn formulation . with this approach , a single distorted black hole could be evolved indefinitely ( e.g. , for thousands of @xmath7 ) with reasonable accuracy @xcite .",
    "these studies allowed the full numerical determination of gravitational waveforms from black hole ringdowns as the distorted black hole settled down to a physically and numerically stable final state , and provided a foundation for future advances in black - hole binary simulations @xcite .",
    "however , another aspect of spatial gauge conditions remained a critical issue for long - lasting black - hole binary simulations .",
    "as general relativity allows arbitrary coordinate systems , many groups adopted coordinate conditions which did not allow the black holes to move through the computational domain .",
    "this simplified the problem of dealing with the black hole singularities , which were handled either by excising the black hole interiors ( within the horizons ) from the computational domain @xcite , or by representing the black holes as punctures @xcite .",
    "though progress had been made toward implementing moving excision regions @xcite , it was computationally much simpler to demand that the excision region remain fixed on the grid @xcite . similarly , the puncture treatment was formulated so that the black hole was fixed on the grid and the singularity was factored out and handled analytically in a time - independent manner . however , for binary configurations in which the black holes physically move , the cost of keeping the black holes fixed in coordinate space was paid by the twisting and stretching of the dynamical fields , eventually leading to large computational errors .    for inspiraling binary configurations one potential solution was to attempt to untwist the geometric field data by imposing comoving coordinates using a shift vector that is dynamically adjusted during the evolution of the binary to minimize motion of the black hole horizons @xcite .",
    "with this approach , brgmann et al . achieved a significant milestone : the first simulation of a full orbital cycle of a black - hole binary system prior to merger @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the authors applied a dynamically adjusted corotating frame tracking the measured position of the black hole apparent horizons .",
    "this allowed a simulation which remained accurate for a little longer than the @xmath31 duration of a complete orbit .",
    "however , problems occurred with the large characteristic speeds that resulted near the outer boundaries , limiting the domains of these simulations and preventing gravitational waveforms from being measured effectively .",
    "the coordinate control also required fine tuning which eventually failed , causing the simulation to crash as the black holes finally approached merger .        in early 2005 pretorius shocked the numerical relativity community by announcing the first complete , robust simulations of an equal - mass black hole merger @xcite . after completing @xmath32 orbit ,",
    "the black holes plunged and merged to form a single distorted black hole that then rings down .",
    "pretorius extracted the gravitational waves to obtain the first inspiraling merger waveform directly from numerical relativity , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2_pretoriuspsi4 ] .",
    "pretorius employed several techniques that were very different from most other numerical approaches to the black - hole binary problem @xcite .",
    "rather than using the bssn formulation , he applied a generalized harmonic formalism @xcite , directly integrating the spacetime metric with evolution equations of second - order in both space and time .",
    "these equations were implemented numerically using adaptive mesh refinement to allow high resolution around the black holes while maintaining a large computational domain .",
    "pretorius utilized spatial coordinates compactified to draw spatial infinity into the computational domain , with a choice of gauge - evolution strongly tied to his evolution formalism .",
    "following @xcite , he added terms to the evolution equations to specifically damp away any violations of the constraints . in his simulations ,",
    "the black holes were excised and moved freely across the computational grid .",
    "pretorius success with such novel methods quickly raised questions as to whether the struggling , more widely - pursued bssn - based puncture approach might be off course .",
    "later that same year , however , a new robust method based on the bssn formulation was announced .",
    "the `` moving puncture '' method was discovered simultaneously and independently by the groups at the university of texas at brownsville ( utb ) @xcite and nasa s goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) @xcite . in this approach",
    "the black holes are represented as punctures , but are not constrained to remain fixed on the coordinate grid .",
    "rather , they are allowed to move freely through the grid using novel coordinate conditions .",
    "figure  [ fig3_utbprltrack ] shows the trajectories of the puncture black holes as computed by the utb group ; the formation of a common horizon marks the point of merger .",
    "the moving puncture method eliminates the analytic representation of the puncture singularities in favor of an approximate numerical treatment within the black hole horizons .",
    "the utb and gsfc groups had discovered and applied similar methods to the same problem : evolving an equal - mass nonspinning black - hole binary from near the final orbit , through merger and ringdown , and studying the gravitational waves .",
    "the first generation of merger waveforms from pretorius , gsfc , and utb showed the same simple burst of radiation ending in a damped - sinusoidal ringdown , and were qualitatively consistent with the lazarus project results discussed above and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_lazaruswf ] .",
    "the discovery of the moving puncture method ignited the field of black - hole binary evolutions .",
    "since it was based on commonly used methods , most researchers in the field were quickly able to achieve accurate and stable evolutions using their existing codes , with the adoption of simple coordinate conditions @xcite .",
    "suddenly , the game was on and nearly all the groups were participating .",
    "with the advent of successful numerical evolutions of binaries that inspiral and merge , the numerical relativity community s focus changed to investigating the physics of binary mergers .",
    "this advancing frontier is enabled by continued technical improvements in areas ranging from initial data prescriptions to more accurate numerical methods .",
    "the astrophysical black hole mergers that are the targets of current and future gravitational wave detectors are expected to reach the merger stage after having radiated away any initial eccentricity @xcite and proceeding through a long quasi - circular inspiral .",
    "all equal - mass , nonspinning binary merger simulations starting from such orbits in the inspiral should produce the same gravitational waveform , subject only to rescaling with the total mass of the system .",
    "for many years , concerns had been raised about the accuracy and realism of black - hole binary initial data sets , including the effects of spurious gravitational radiation and eccentricity @xcite . with numerical relativity now",
    "able to simulate the final merger , the next step was to run models with enough orbits before the plunge and merger to get complete and reproducible waveforms starting from the late inspiral .",
    "the gsfc group produced the first representation of the definitive waveform for the final stages of a merger of equal - mass , nonspinning black holes @xcite .",
    "they carried out a series of four simulations with the holes starting from quasicircular initial conditions at increasingly larger separations . in these runs , the holes completed @xmath33 , and @xmath34 orbits before the formation of a common horizon . to compare the results of these models , they chose the moment of peak gravitational radiation amplitude as the fiducial time @xmath35 .",
    "the orbital dynamics of the binaries can be examined by tracking the black hole centers , given by the location of the punctures .",
    "the black hole trajectories for each run were oriented so that they superpose at the fiducial @xmath36 . in the early stages of each run ,",
    "the tracks clearly showed the effects of eccentricity in the initial conditions , with the amount of initial eccentricity decreasing for more widely separated holes .",
    "as the holes spiraled together deeper into the strong - field regime , the tracks locked on to a universal trajectory independent of their initial conditions that continued for the last orbit , plunge , and merger .",
    "figure  [ fig4_qcnwaves ] reveals the corresponding universal gravitational waveform . here",
    ", the dominant @xmath37 , @xmath38 quadrupolar component for each run is shown , shifted in time so that the peak radiation amplitude occurs at @xmath35 . starting from @xmath39",
    "the waveforms show nearly perfect agreement , differing from each other at the level of @xmath40 .",
    "the signals for the preceding few orbits agree at the level of @xmath41 , except for a brief burst of spurious radiation at the start of each run .",
    "note that the merger waveform shows a remarkably simple shape , making a smooth transition from the inspiral chirp to the damped sinusoid of the ringdown .",
    "as the merger begins , both the wave amplitude and frequency increase , albeit faster than in the inspiral .",
    "the amplitude reaches a peak and then decreases , dropping exponentially through the ringdown .",
    "the frequency increases monotonically to a maximum value that remains constant during the ringdown .    of course",
    ", the black - hole binary merger dynamics and waveforms can be altered by the presence of large amounts of eccentricity @xcite and spurious gravitational radiation @xcite near the time of the plunge .",
    "however , the robustness of the merger to modest deviations from astrophysical initial conditions opened the door to studying many cases of interest using relatively short simulations , starting just a few orbits before the start of the plunge .",
    "astrophysical black - hole binaries are unlikely to have exactly equal masses .",
    "currently , numerical relativists are able to evolve systems with mass ratios up to @xmath42 @xcite . starting from quasicircular orbits",
    "the simulations show that the merger phase for nonspinning , unequal mass black hole binaries is robust to modest deviations from these initial conditions and produces a generally simple waveform shape .",
    "an important tool for analyzing these mergers is a decomposition into spin - weighted spherical harmonic modes .",
    "berti et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed a set of unequal - mass nonspinning mergers with mass ratios ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "studying the multipolar distribution of the radiation , they found that the sub - dominant modes ( @xmath45 ) become more important , carrying a larger fraction of the energy , as @xmath9 increases .",
    "specifically , for @xmath46 , the @xmath47 mode typically carries @xmath41 of the radiated energy . also , as expected from symmetry considerations , the odd-@xmath48 modes are suppressed in the equal - mass limit .",
    "baker et al .",
    "@xcite carried out a complementary study of the radiation from nonspinning mergers with mass ratios in the range @xmath49 .",
    "the multipolar decomposition clearly shows that the hallmark simplicity of the waveform persists for @xmath50 and extends to each of the spherical harmonic components @xmath51 ; this property has recently been shown to extend to the @xmath52 case @xcite . in the full mode - summed waveform",
    ", this simple shape is also seen when viewing along the system s orbital axis , where the quadrupole mode dominates .",
    "a somewhat more complex appearance arises by viewing the system off - axis , where higher multipoles contribute more strongly to the waveform at various angles .    throughout the entire coalescence ,",
    "each of the spherical harmonic waveform components is circularly polarized , with steadily varying phase and amplitude @xcite . for each mass ratio",
    "@xmath9 , the rotational phase ( and frequency ) of the different @xmath53 components are the same . during the inspiral",
    "this is expected , since the waveform phase is equal to the rotational phase multiplied by the mode number @xmath48 . however , for the @xmath54 modes this relationship also holds throughout the merger and into the ringdown .",
    "these properties suggest a simple conceptual interpretation in which the radiation is generated by an `` implicit rotating source . '' in this picture , each @xmath53 mode is generated separately by the @xmath53 moment of some implicit source .",
    "the fixed relationship for the @xmath54 modes implies that these components of the source rotate rigidly through the entire coalescence .",
    "the @xmath55 components are less rigid and peel away from the main @xmath54 trend during the merger @xcite .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath9 is a one - dimensional cut into the parameter space of black - hole binaries .",
    "the remaining parameter space is dominated by the spin angular momentum of each hole .",
    "as spin is a vector quantity , this adds six more dimensions .",
    "simulations of spinning black holes first focused on systems whose spins were expected , on the basis of pn arguments , to have the least effect on the orbital motion",
    ". binaries with aligned and anti - aligned spins are relatively easy to treat as there is no precession of the orbital plane or the individual spins .",
    "when one or both holes has a spin not parallel to the orbital axis , spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions will cause precession that can complicate the evolution and the resulting waveforms @xcite .",
    "the first merger evolutions of spinning black holes were carried out by campanelli et al .",
    "@xcite . they simulated the mergers of two equal - mass highly spinning black holes with @xmath56 , and both spin vectors either aligned or anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum . here , @xmath57 is the magnitude of the black hole spin angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "they also evolved a nonspinning equal - mass binary for comparison .",
    "all three binaries had the same initial orbital angular frequency corresponding to an orbital period @xmath58 , and merged to form a rotating remnant black hole with @xmath59 .",
    "however , the aligned system took noticeably more orbits to merge than the others .",
    "this behavior is caused by the spin - orbit interaction , which produces an effective force between the black holes , either an attractive or repulsive for the anti - aligned or aligned cases , respectively .",
    "all three binaries generate remarkably similar gravitational waveforms having a simple shape , with the aligned case displaying a longer wavetrain and the anti - aligned case a shorter one .",
    "the first fully numerical evolutions of strongly precessing spinning systems were carried out by campanelli et al .",
    "@xcite , who observed both significant precession of the orbits and a `` spin flip , '' in which the final post - merger black hole spins in the direction opposite to the two initial black holes .",
    "more recent work is beginning to probe the effects of spin precession on waveforms @xcite .",
    "studies of this most general of ( non - eccentric ) parameter sets are still in the early stages .",
    "no systematic study of waveform shapes and polarizations has been carried out yet .",
    "a preliminary study of the multipolar structure of gravitational waves from several classes of binaries with equal spins has been performed by berti et al .",
    "they considered an equal - mass case with aligned spins ; several @xmath44 binaries with antialigned ( down - down ) spins ; and three unequal - mass binaries with spins initially in the orbital plane and pointing in opposite directions .",
    "examining the distribution of gravitational - wave energy emitted by various modes , they find that , as in the case of nonspinning mergers , odd-@xmath60 multipoles are suppressed for @xmath43 and that , as @xmath9 increases , more energy is radiated in higher-@xmath60 multipoles .",
    "because the state of the final black hole formed from the coalescence depends primarily on termination of the inspiral and the late burst of radiation in the merger , it can be accurately probed with relatively short simulations of just a few orbits .",
    "the merger of two equal - mass nonspinning black holes produces a final black hole with a moderately high spin , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "since the black holes each start out with no spin , and any tidal spin - up is negligible @xcite , the spin of this final black hole arises from the orbital angular momentum of the original binary .",
    "simulations show that , for this simplest black hole merger , the final spin is `` universal , '' or independent of the initial black hole separation , for modest deviations from quasicircular initial conditions .    for mergers of nonspinning black holes with unequal masses , the spin of the final black hole decreases as the mass ratio @xmath9 increases .",
    "simulations with mass ratios up to @xmath42 show that the final spin parameter scales as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 for @xmath44 and @xmath64 for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the effects of spin - orbit and spin - spin coupling can become important in determining the spin of the final black hole . in the simplest cases , the spin vectors are parallel to the orbital angular momentum . depending on the mass ratio and the black hole spin",
    ", the merger can result in a final black hole with a larger ( spun up ) or a smaller ( spun down ) spin than either of the progenitors @xcite . in certain cases",
    ", the merger can lead to a spin flip with the final black hole spinning in a direction opposite to the spins of the initial holes ; in particular , it is possible to produce a final nonspinning black hole , @xmath65 , from the merger of two spinning holes @xcite .",
    "more general black - hole binaries , with misaligned spins , are further complicated with the effects of precession @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to produce expressions for the final spin vector using analytic techniques or by fitting to results from numerical simulations @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "of particular interest is the question of whether a black hole merger can produce a maximally spinning hole ( @xmath66 ) or indeed exceed the kerr limit ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "current research suggests that this is not possible , even for mergers occurring from hyperbolic encounters @xcite and mergers of highly boosted black holes @xcite .",
    "a notable phenomenon arising from asymmetric binary systems is the merger recoil or kick  a net movement of the end - state black hole from the system s center of mass , caused by the anisotropic emission of gravitational radiation during the coalescence .",
    "fitchett @xcite produced a useful formula for the kick velocity , which has significant applications in astrophysics , using a quasi - newtonian approximation .",
    "several authors also calculated the recoil analytically using pn approximations @xcite .",
    "however , since the dominant part of the effect builds up in the strong - field regime close to merger , full numerical relativity simulations are needed for accurate calculations of the kick .      in 2006 , recoil from a fully numerical binary merger was demonstrated for the first time by herrmann et al .",

    "figure  [ fig5_jenakickfit ] shows the resulting range of recoil speeds , together with several earlier numerical and analytical estimates .",
    "the authors synthesized these into a single recoil formula , a nonlinear correction to the fitchett formula , yielding a maximum recoil of 175 @xmath69for a mass ratio of @xmath73 .",
    "this has recently been tested for the more extreme @xmath52 mass ratio , with general agreement @xcite .",
    "calculations of recoil in the much larger parameter space of spinning binaries began with the non - precessing cases of holes with spins aligned ( or anti - aligned ) with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "several studies of this region of parameter space @xcite have revealed that the kick velocity has a quadratic dependence on initial spins , with a maximum kick of 448 @xmath69for extremal kerr holes , @xmath74 .",
    "for these anti / aligned cases , as well as for nonspinning unequal - mass black - hole mergers , the direction of the kick velocity is always in the orbital plane .",
