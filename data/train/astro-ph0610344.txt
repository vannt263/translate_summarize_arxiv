    "questions about the origin of galactic cosmic rays ( cr ) have motivated the development of @xmath0-ray astronomy over 100  gev as @xmath0-rays from @xmath2 decay were expected to trace cr acceleration sites  @xcite . however , measured tev spectra are most generally explained in terms of inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of photons by high energy electrons .",
    "current observations do not allow to unambiguously identify a hadron component in @xmath0-ray spectra @xcite . at higher energy , synchrotron cooling of electrons",
    "becomes more important and should cause the ic component of spectra to soften .",
    "a cutoff is expected below or around 100  tev .",
    "the @xmath0-rays resulting from hadron processes may not display a similar cutoff  @xcite .",
    "their contribution could extend up to several hundred tev depending on cr acceleration maximum energy in the source .",
    "spectral measurements around 100  tev could provide clear discrimination between electron and hadron processes .",
    "current experiments are not likely to reach 100  tev because their limited collection area makes the required exposures unreasonable .",
    "it required 5  years ( @xmath3 of observation ) with the hegra experiment  @xcite to measure the crab nebula spectrum up to 80  tev , the highest astrophysical @xmath0-ray energy ever reported . from extrapolating galactic source spectra measured with hegra and hess  @xcite",
    ", it appears future projects need to achieve at least @xmath4 ( figure  [ fig ] ) to obtain meaningful measurements at 100  tev .",
    "ground detectors arrays like milagro  @xcite detect charged particles in the air - shower tail .",
    "they benefit from a close to @xmath5 duty cycle and with their large field of view they can observe each source for @xmath6 .",
    "milagro already offers a large exposure ( @xmath7 ) , but its sensitivity is limited by its angular resolution and its cr discrimination .",
    "the hawc project  @xcite should be a strong improvement over this .",
    "its effective collection area was estimated up to 10  tev and is expected to remain constant(@xmath8 ) at higher energy .",
    "hawc will reach a @xmath4 exposure per year .",
    "iact can be used only during clear , and usually moonless , nights .",
    "the duty cycle is about 10% .",
    "maximal observation time for a source is 200 - 300  h / year . in order",
    "for their science program to be diversified , small field of view ( fov ) iact generally are not dedicated to any given source for more than 100  h / year . to achieve @xmath4 exposure per year , future iact experiments need to offer effective collection areas of at least @xmath9 with a small fov or @xmath10 with full - sky survey capability .",
    "the ground level light density is relatively constant within the central plateau ( @xmath11 radius for vertical showers ) of the cherenkov light pool and decreases rapidly with the distance from the shower core outside the central plateau . at large zenithal angle",
    "the plateau radius is much larger ( @xmath12400 m at @xmath13 of elevation ) .",
    "the three approaches we identified to use the cerenkov light distribution are discussed in the next section .",
    "-rays from galactic sources as a function of the energy .",
    "the right - hand side shows the sensitivities of several projects ( described in the text ) compared to a few galactic source spectra . ]",
    "at low elevation showers are developing much further away and a single telescope can reach a @xmath9 collection area even with a small fov ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this observation technique is common  @xcite , providing large collection areas at very high energies .",
    "however , several problems and difficulties appear : small images provide poor discrimination and shower reconstruction , large base lines are still necessary for good stereoscopic views , atmospheric monitoring becomes critical and the observing program is much more constrained . for these reasons , a dedicated low elevation experiment does not seem very appealing .",
    "figure  [ fig ] shows our estimate of veritas  @xcite 25h sensitivity at low elevation .      in order to exploit the tail of the cherenkov light pool at high elevation ,",
    "iact telescopes need a large fov ( @xmath15 for @xmath9 effective area )  @xcite .",
    "we simulated an @xmath16 telescope with a @xmath17 camera based on the design of the tale project  @xcite which includes a `` fly s eye '' air fluorescence telescope for the study of cr around @xmath18 . with an improved @xmath19 pixel camera and 20mhz fadc ,",
    "the energy threshold is estimated at @xmath20 in the plateau and increase as a function impact parameter ( @xmath21 at @xmath22 and @xmath23 at @xmath24 ) .",
    "the effective collection area increases with energy advantageously for sensitivity but makes spectral analysis strongly monte - carlo dependent .",
    "the angular resolution is about @xmath25 at @xmath21 and less than @xmath26 over @xmath27 . assuming a yearly observation time of 200  h ( time expected for an all sky - survey over @xmath28 elevation )",
    ", we estimate the point source sensitivity of a tale like experiment ( see figure  [ fig ] ) .",
    "this curve does not include the effects of @xmath0-ray shower image shape discrimination capabilities which still have to be studied .      a large area telescope array ( cta , he - astro  @xcite , tenten  @xcite , gratis ) could be made to indefinitely extend the collection area .",
    "projects of this type are expensive and challenging because of the large number of units involved .",
    "they also offer the best @xmath0-ray discrimination and reconstruction capabilities  @xcite . the gamma - ray astrophysical telescope imaging system ( gratis )",
    "is a minimal approach to a 0.3 - 100  tev large array , consisting of 37 @xmath29 diameter telescopes with @xmath14 fov ( 253 @xmath25 pixels ) , covering @xmath9 in a @xmath30 spaced hexagonal lattice .",
    "any point in the array is less than 115  m from a telescope ( @xmath31cherenkov plateau radius ) . from simulations of just one triangular cell we estimate the energy threshold ( @xmath32 ) , angular resolution ( @xmath33 at @xmath34 and @xmath35 above @xmath21 ) and cr rejection .",
    "figure  [ fig ] shows the gratis sensitivity of the 54 triangles in the array .",
    "this sensitivity is conservative at high energies as showers do trigger more than 3 telescopes improving rejection and angular resolution , and because @xmath0-rays with impact parameters outside the array are not included in this estimate .",
    "recent findings in the field of tev astronomy provide motivation for extending the covered energy range to more than 100  tev where @xmath0-ray emission models can be better discriminated .",
    "simulation - based estimates of various experimental approaches to 100  tev astronomy are compared .",
    "large arrays of iact telescopes seem the most attractive from the point of view of the sensitivity they offer .",
    "even a relatively low cost ( $ 17 m ) project such as gratis provides sufficient sensitivity to measure many galactic source spectra from 300  gev to more than 100  tev . with their all sky survey capability in an uncharted energy window ,",
    "projects like hawc or even tale have a great and complementary exploratory potential ."
