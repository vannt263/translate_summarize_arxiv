    "historically , the simplest quark models envisaged the nucleon s properties and structure being determined entirely in terms of its valence @xmath6- and @xmath7-quark constituents . the subsequent development of qcd necessitated refinements of this picture ,",
    "in which a sea of virtual quark  antiquark ( @xmath8 ) pairs and gluons made the nucleon a far richer and more dynamic environment . in this new paradigm ,",
    "not only did the light - quark @xmath8 sea display nontrivial structure , but heavier quarks such as the strange or even charm quark could contribute locally to the internal nucleon dynamics .",
    "the role that strange quarks , in particular , play in the nucleon has been the focus of attention in hadronic physics for nearly three decades .",
    "early polarized deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments suggested that a surprisingly large fraction of the proton s spin might be carried by strange quarks @xcite , in contrast to the naive quark model expectations @xcite .",
    "recognition that the spatial distributions of strange quarks and antiquarks could be different further motivated searches for strange contributions to the nucleon s electroweak form factors @xcite .",
    "dedicated programs of strange form factor measurements through parity - violating electron scattering at jefferson lab and other facilities @xcite subsequently yielded very precise determinations of both the strange electric and magnetic form factors of the nucleon @xcite , enabling rigorous comparisons with lattice qcd and chiral effective theory @xcite , as well as fundamental tests of the standard model @xcite .",
    "one of the guiding principles for understanding the nonperturbative features of strange quarks and antiquarks in the nucleon sea has been chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "while the generation of @xmath9 pairs through perturbative gluon radiation typically produces symmetric @xmath3 and @xmath1 distributions ( at least up to two loop corrections @xcite ) , any significant difference between the momentum dependence of the @xmath3 and @xmath1 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) would be a clear signal of nonperturbative effects .",
    "in fact , insights from chiral symmetry breaking in the nonstrange sector led to the prediction @xcite of an excess of @xmath10 antiquarks over @xmath11 in the proton , which was spectacularly confirmed in dis @xcite and drell - yan @xcite experiments more than a decade later .",
    "a similar mechanism , which can be intuitively realized in the form of a pseudoscalar meson cloud surrounding a valence - quark nucleon core , was subsequently used @xcite to demonstrate the natural emergence of a nonzero @xmath5 asymmetry from the breaking of the chiral su(3 ) symmetry of qcd .",
    "while the existence of an @xmath5 asymmetry is not , from the point of view of nonperturbative qcd dynamics , terribly surprising in itself , the magnitude and even the sign of the asymmetry has historically been far more difficult to determine .",

    "have generally found positive values for @xmath20 . on the other hand , the various approximations made about nuclear corrections to the neutrino data and the various functional forms chosen for the pdfs make any current phenomenological analysis subject to sizeable uncertainties .",

    "nonperturbatively , the most common approach to computing the @xmath5 asymmetry has been in the framework of meson cloud models , which focus on the role of the nucleon s light - front wave function with fock state component consisting of kaons and hyperons , @xmath27 here the asymmetric dissociation of the nucleon into a hyperon ( containing the @xmath3 quark ) and a kaon ( containing the @xmath1 antiquark ) automatically generates asymmetric distributions for the @xmath3 and @xmath1 pdfs .    first estimated nearly 3 decades ago using phenomenological nucleon - kaon - hyperon vertex form factors @xcite , subsequent kaon cloud model calculations have , however , at times yielded conflicting results . using a light - front formalism that enabled simultaneous computation of strange observables in both deep - inelastic and elastic scattering",
    ", the small experimental values of the strange electromagnetic form factors were found @xcite to restrict the magnitude of @xmath5 to be very small , with a shape strongly dependent on the choice of the @xmath28 vertex function .",
    "cao and signal @xcite later observed that while fluctuations to @xmath29 and @xmath30 states gave rise to a small positive asymmetry , @xmath31 , the inclusion of the heavier @xmath32 mesons @xcite changed the sign of the overall asymmetry , @xmath33 , with the magnitude remaining rather small .",
    "considering @xmath29 fluctuations of the nucleon with a gaussian probability distribution whose parameters are constrained by inclusive dis data and normalization tuned to @xmath34 from the ccfr data @xcite , alwall and ingelman @xcite found a harder @xmath3 pdf than @xmath1 , with @xmath35 . in that model",
    "the fluctuations to @xmath30 and @xmath36 states were argued to be implicitly included in the @xmath29 result , with the sign of @xmath20 remaining positive .",
    "models with couplings to the mesons parametrized at the quark level have also been considered by several authors . using an effective chiral quark model with constituent quarks coupling to goldstone bosons , ding _",
    "@xcite found @xmath37 , depending on the input used for bare constituent quark distributions .",
    "wakamatsu @xcite used an su(3 ) chiral quark soliton model with an effective mass difference parameter between the strange and nonstrange quarks to obtain the range @xmath38 .",
    "most recently , hobbs _ et al . _ extended previous light - front calculations using a scalar tetraquark spectator model with gaussian and power - law wave functions @xcite , finding @xmath39 .    in all these models , while the basic physics principles underlying the generation of the @xmath5 asymmetry are similar , the _ ad hoc _ nature of some of the model assumptions and ingredients have inevitably led to a fairly wide range of predictions , with a consequent lack of consensus about the nature of the asymmetry . clearly , if one is to make reliable predictions for @xmath20 , a more systematic approach is needed , one which has a more direct connection to the underlying qcd theory .    the first such unambiguous connection between the kaon cloud of the nucleon and qcd came with the realization @xcite that in chiral expansions of moments of strange quark pdfs , the coefficients of the leading nonanalytic ( lna ) terms in the kaon mass , @xmath40 , are model independent and can only arise from pseudoscalar meson loops . starting from the most general effective lagrangian consistent with the chiral symmetry of qcd , at a given order in the chiral expansion a unique set of diagrams can be identified and computed systematically @xcite .",
    "the long distance ( @xmath41 ) effects in such expansions are thus dictated solely by chiral symmetry and gauge invariance , while the short distance contributions are treated with a particular regularization procedure .",

    "we emphasize the importance of using regularization procedures that preserve the chiral and gauge symmetries of qcd , and contrast these with previous calculations in the literature using form factors at hadronic vertices .",
    "we further explore the consequences of the @xmath0-function contribution to the @xmath1 distribution at zero momentum fraction that arises from the weinberg - tomozawa contact interaction in the chiral theory , and identify a valence - like component of the strange pdf .",
    "suggestions of possible @xmath0-function contributions to pdfs were raised earlier @xcite in discussions of the unpolarized schwinger term and proton spin sum rules .",
    "the practical implication of the @xmath0-function terms is to provide significantly greater flexibility in the allowed phenomenological parametrization of the @xmath5 difference , suggesting that current forms used in global pdf analysis may be too restrictive .",
    "in addition to its intrinsic value , understanding the sign and magnitude of the @xmath5 asymmetry is also vital for the extraction of the paschos - wolfenstein ratio from neutrino  nucleus dis data . specifically , it has been suggested that a large positive value of @xmath44 could resolve much of the discrepancy between the @xmath45 value extracted by the nutev collaboration @xcite and the standard model @xcite .",
    "a negative value for @xmath20 would , in contrast , exacerbate the disagreement .",

    "[ fig : xssbar ] . here",
    "both the sum @xmath34 and difference @xmath376 are illustrated at @xmath336  gev@xmath19 for both sets of cutoff values . to display the sum and difference on the same plot , we scale the much larger @xmath34 distribution by a factor 1/4 .",
    "( scaled down by a factor 1/4 ) and difference @xmath376 of the strange and antistrange pdfs from kaon loops at @xmath377  gev@xmath19 with fit parameters @xmath368  mev ( left panel ) and @xmath369  mev ( right panel).,width=624 ]    for the best fit parameters @xmath368  mev , the @xmath376 distribution peaks at around @xmath378 , and has a zero crossing at @xmath379 , resulting in some cancellation of the positive distribution at low @xmath4 and negative distribution at large @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , for the @xmath369  mev cutoff values , the asymmetry stays positive for all values of @xmath4 , with no zero crossing evident at @xmath380 . while this would not have been possible in previous kaon loop calculations based on the on - shell parts of the rainbow diagrams alone , fig .",
    "[ fig : loops](a ) and ( c ) , in the full chiral analysis strangeness is conserved through the presence of the @xmath0-function contribution giving an overall positive @xmath1 at @xmath2 , as evident in table  [ tab:1_moment ] .",
    "this feature is not present in phenomenological pdf analyses of data , which are sensitive only to the @xmath380 region .",
    "our observation of nonzero @xmath1 contributions increases the flexibility of data analyses , by allowing a nonzero @xmath5 distribution which does not need to integrate to zero for @xmath380 .",
    "note also that in ref .",
    "@xcite the smallest difference @xmath20 was found for the extreme case of @xmath349  mev and the minimal possible value of @xmath381 .",
    "for this value , the ( generally positive ) @xmath0-function contribution to @xmath3 is rendered zero , thereby minimizing the @xmath5 difference . while allowed phenomenologically , this scenario appears less likely than the two cases considered above .",
    "finally , we can evaluate the effect of the @xmath5 asymmetry on the extraction of the weak mixing angle @xmath45 from the nutev data @xcite .",
    "folding the calculated pdfs with the nutev acceptance functional , we find a correction that lies in the range @xmath382 at @xmath383  gev@xmath19 , corresponding to the range @xmath384 found here .",
    "the negative @xmath385 correction reduces the overall discrepancy between the nutev value for the weak mixing angle and the world average , but only by @xmath386 .",
    "our analysis therefore suggests that other explanations , possibly involving an isospin dependent nuclear emc effect @xcite or charge symmetry violation in pdfs @xcite , may be more relevant in resolving the discrepancy @xcite .",
    "even after decades of study the quark  antiquark sea of the nucleon offers both challenges and the potential for surprises .",
    "the asymmetry between @xmath10 and @xmath11 antiquarks , with the consequent violation of the gottfried sum rule , is an obvious example  @xcite . in this work",
    "we have focussed on the potential for an asymmetry between the strange and antistrange quark pdfs in the nucleon . apart from relatively small effects arising at three - loop order in perturbative qcd @xcite ,",
    "the dissociation of a nucleon into a kaon and a hyperon , associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral su(3 ) symmetry , is the natural source of such an asymmetry .",
    "we have extended earlier studies of non - strange chiral corrections to nucleon properties , in which the requirements of gauge invariance and chiral symmetry were systematically explored . beyond leading order in the chiral expansion",
    "this necessitates the inclusion of kroll - ruderman terms , in addition to the usual rainbow diagrams and tadpole contributions .",
    "we have carefully explained the derivation of and presented formulas for the total contribution to the @xmath3 and @xmath1 distributions at next - to - leading order in the chiral expansion .",
    "a novel feature of the calculation is the appearance of @xmath0-function terms from kaon bubble diagrams , which contribute to the @xmath1 distribution at @xmath2 .",
    "these terms are independent of the ultraviolet regulator , and have the important practical consequence that , in any experimental or phenomenological study in which @xmath2 is inaccessible , the integral of @xmath5 will not vanish .",
    "a further phenomenologically important consequence of the @xmath0-function terms from the kaon tadpole diagram is that for the @xmath3-quark distribution the corresponding splitting function is a @xmath0-function at @xmath387 , where @xmath388 is the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the hyperon .",
    "this leads to a valence - like component of the strange sea , which can not be generated from gluon radiation in perturbative qcd alone .    with the help of experimental data from inclusive @xmath75 production in @xmath47 scattering and results from global pdf fits @xcite , we have obtained constraints on the mass parameters for the pauli - villars regulators used in the numerical calculation of the kaon loop contributions .",
    "we find that @xmath3 and @xmath1 quarks from this source contribute up to @xmath389 of the total momentum of the nucleon , or @xmath390 of the phenomenological strange sea of the nucleon at a scale of @xmath336  gev@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the magnitude of the strange asymmetry , @xmath5 , is about a factor of 10 smaller than the sum . compared with other possible corrections to the nutev anomaly @xcite ,",
    "this is a relatively minor effect , reducing the discrepancy by less than 0.5  @xmath343 .",
    "the sign is , however , such as to reduce the anomaly , which in itself answers a long - standing uncertainty .",
    "future improvements in the empirical determination of @xmath5 could be obtained from higher precision deep - inelastic neutrino and antineutrino scattering data from hydrogen or deuterium . more immediately , perhaps , further constraints may be possible through measurement of associated charm and weak boson production in @xmath47 scattering at the lhc @xcite . the theoretical framework utilized here",
    "can also be extended to systematically explore the effects of kaon loops within the chiral theory on strange quark polarization , including contributions from both octet and decuplet hyperons , which will be discussed in a separate publication @xcite .",
