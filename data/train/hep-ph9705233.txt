    "<S> * c#1 * , # 2 ( 19#3 )    ifum 565-ft + hep - ph/9705233    for some time now it has been known that angular ordering [ 1 ] is an essential element in any description of small-@xmath0 final state properties [ 2 ] . as a first step of a programme to study the final state in small-@xmath0 physics </S>",
    "<S> , one should examine the effect of angular ordering on the small-@xmath0 evolution of the gluon structure function . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological studies have already been performed [ 3 ] , but this talk will examine the solutions of the ccfm equation [ 2 ] from a more theoretical point of view .    </S>",
    "<S> [ gpsfig : kinebw ]    the main difference between the bfkl [ 4 ] and ccfm equations is in the collinear region : in the bfkl case , the @xmath1 emission has transverse momentum @xmath2 , with @xmath3 ; this regulates the collinear divergence which is present , but gives the wrong final state properties . in the ccfm case , </S>",
    "<S> angular ordering of emissions leads to the following condition ( see figure  1 ) :    @xmath4    with the corresponding gluon emission distribution being    @xmath5    the non - sudakov form factor @xmath6 , which is analogous to a probability for suppressing any further radiation , is defined by    @xmath7    the elimination of a large fraction of the small - transverse - momentum emissions means that angular ordering has a big effect on the final state . </S>",
    "<S> but in structure function evolution , since collinear singularities cancel , at leading order the bfkl and ccfm structure functions are equivalent .    as part of a program to carry out a full investigation of the effects of angular ordering at small @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> this talk examines the component of the next - to - leading order corrections to structure function evolution that arise from angular ordering . </S>",
    "<S> such effects are expected to be part of the full nlo contribution [ 5 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively since angular ordering reduces the phase space for evolution , the exponent of the small-@xmath0 growth ought to be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry , present in the bfkl equation , between large and small scales will be broken , favouring evolution to large momentum scales . finally diffusion will be reduced because large jumps ( down ) in scale are suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two limits in which the effects of angular ordering should disappear : as @xmath8 , because the typical @xmath9 will be very small ( this justifies the assertion that for structure functions the effects of angular ordering are next to leading ) ; and in the double - leading - logarithmic limit because the condition @xmath10 automatically satisfies the angular ordering condition .    the analytic treatment of the ccfm equation is more complicated than that of the bfkl equation because the gluon density contains one extra parameter , @xmath11 , which defines the maximum angle for the emitted gluons . in dis it enters through the angle of the quarks produced in the boson - gluon fusion . </S>",
    "<S> the equation for the ccfm density , @xmath12 , of gluons with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 and transverse momentum @xmath13 is :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 . by analogy to the bfkl equation one can develop some understanding of it by looking for eigensolutions ( strictly speaking eigensolutions of the equation without an inhomogeneous term and with no upper limit in the @xmath16 integral ) of the form    @xmath17    where @xmath18 parameterises the unknown dependence on @xmath11 . for @xmath19 , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains a coupled pair of equations for @xmath20 and @xmath21 :    @xmath22    with the initial condition @xmath23 and    @xmath24    in the second of these equations , if @xmath25 one notes that @xmath26 is just the bfkl characteristic function . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath27 is formally of order @xmath28 , this demonstrates that angular ordering has a next - to - leading effect on structure function evolution . </S>",
    "<S> one can also show that in the limit of @xmath29 the difference @xmath30 tends to a constant , which implies corrections to the small-@xmath0 anomalous dimension of the form @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ gpsfig : cvg ]    though a number of asymptotic properties of @xmath18 have been determined [ 6 ] , it has not so far been possible to obtain its full analytic form . </S>",
    "<S> further understanding requires numerical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this has been carried out and figure  2 shows the results for @xmath26 compared to the bfkl characteristic function for three different values of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> it illustrates that as @xmath32 the two tend to coincide as happens also in the region @xmath33 ( the dlla region ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the loss of symmetry under @xmath34 relates to the loss of symmetry between small and large scales . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the bfkl case , there is no longer even a divergence at @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the minimum of the characteristic function gets shifted to the right and is lower .    particularly strong </S>",
    "<S> is the change in the second derivative , which for @xmath36 is reduced by a factor a two , indicating that for a given amount of diffusion to occur , one needs twice the rapidity ( @xmath37 range ) predicted by the bfkl equation , as seen for example in the result of mueller [ 7 ] for the @xmath0 value where the operator - product expansion starts to break down due to diffusion ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the qcd scale , @xmath40 some starting point for the small-@xmath0 evolution , and @xmath41 the hard scale of the problem . </S>"
