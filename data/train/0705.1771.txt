    "the high positional and moderate energy resolutions of the charged couple device ( ccd ) established this device to be the main detector for imaging spectroscopy in x - ray astronomy since asca / sis @xcite .",
    "however , one drawback to an x - ray ccd in - orbit is the degradation of the gain and energy resolution due to an increase of the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) .",
    "the proton irradiation on the ccd chip increases the number of charge traps in the ccd , which is composed of silicon crystals .",
    "this defect is more severe for low energy protons because they deposit more energy than high energy protons in the ccd transfer channel .",
    "the main origin of the cti and consequent gain degradation is the increase of charge traps .",
    "in fact , chandra / acis has suffered from a degraded energy resolution due to the low - energy ( @xmath0  10 - 100  kev ) protons in the van allen belts @xcite .",
    "although a thick shielding around the ccd camera can significantly reduce the proton flux on the ccd , the radiation damage can not be ignored over a mission lifetime of several years .    in order to maintain the good performance of ccds in orbit , the cti must be frequently measured and applied to the data .",
    "most of the major x - ray missions are provided with one or more calibration sources to measure the cti .",
    "the number of charge traps is not uniformly distributed over the ccd imaging area , and hence the cti is also not uniform over the imaging area . therefore the cti correction should be independently executed for each column ( vertical transfer channel ) .",
    "however , the limited flux of calibration x - rays impedes an accurate and frequent measurement of the cti and its spatial variation over the imaging area .    recently",
    "a charge injection technique has been developed @xcite .",
    "a charge packet with the amount of @xmath1 is artificially injected through a charge injection gate @xcite into each column and is subsequently readout as @xmath2 after the charge transfer in the same manner as the x - ray event .",
    "this method allows us to measure a charge loss ( @xmath3 = @xmath1  @xmath2 ) for each column , which in turn , can potentially be a powerful tool for the cti calibration .",
    "the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite and references therein ) onboard the japanese 5@xmath4 x - ray satellite suzaku @xcite is equipped with a charge injection structure @xcite .",
    "the low earth orbit makes the detector background of the xis lower and more stable than those of chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "however , the xis s gain and energy resolution have gradually degraded due to the increase of the cti during transit through the south atlantic anomaly . after six - month from the first - light of the xis , the cti has increased to non - negligible level . this result has stimulated us to investigate the in - orbit charge injection performances .",
    "this paper reports on the results .",
    "section [ sect : about_ccd ] and [ sect : about_ci ] of this paper describe the xis and charge injection capability .",
    "section [ sect : experiments ] is devoted to the cti experiments , while section [ sect : cal_results ] describes the results of the ground and onboard experiments .",
    "the discussion and summary are in section [ sect : discussion ] and [ sect : summary ] , respectively .",
    "the mean ionization energy of an electron by an x - ray in silicon is assumed to be @xmath5 throughout this paper .",
    "@xcite have provided details on the xis and ccds ( mit lincoln laboratory model ccid41 ) .",
    "hence , we briefly duplicate for the charge injection study of this paper .",
    "the ccds are the three - phase frame transfer type and have basically the same structure as those of chandra / acis .",
    "each pixel size is 24  @xmath6 m @xmath7 24  @xmath6 m and the number of the pixels is 1024 @xmath7 1024 in the imaging area .",
    "therefore , the size of the imaging area is @xmath0 25  mm @xmath7 25  mm .",
    "the exposure time is 8  sec for the normal clocking mode . with the radiative cooling and a peltier cooler , the ccd temperature is controlled to 90  @xmath8c .",
    "hence , the dark current is suppressed to @xmath02 electrons/8sec / pixel .",
    "four ccds are onboard suzaku .",
    "three of them are the front - illuminated ( fi ) chips , while the other is the back - illuminated ( bi ) chip .",
    "the bi chip has the same basic specifications as the fi chips , except that the bi chip has a larger quantum efficiency in the soft energy band .",
    "the ground calibrations verified that the thickness of the depletion layer is @xmath0  65  @xmath6 m for the fi chips , and @xmath0  42  @xmath6 m for the bi chip . in order to see the function of the ccd , we give the schematic view of the xis fi chip in figure  [ fig : ccd_pic_sche ] .",
    "each ccd chip has four segments ( from a to d ) , and each segment has one readout node .",
    "@xmath9fe calibration sources , which irradiate the upper edge of the segment a and d , are used for the monitoring of the gain , cti , and energy resolution in orbit .",
    "@xcite have reported details of the charge injection structure . by referring to figures  [ fig : ccd_pic_sche ] and [ fig : ci_schematic ] , here",
    "we describe the essential function of the charge injection . for the brevity to describe the charge injection technique and its results , notations of parameters , which will be frequently used in this paper",
    "are listed in table  [ tab : abbr ] .    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     a serial register of 1024 pixels long is attached to the next of the upper edge of the imaging area ( hereafter we call this charge injection register ) .",
    "an input gate is equipped at left of the charge injection register ( see figure  [ fig : ccd_pic_sche ] ) . pulling down the potential for electrons at the input gate and the next electrode ( s3 in figure  [ fig : ci_schematic ] ) ,",
    "the potential well is filled with charges with the amount of @xmath1 . then pulling up the potential ,",
    "the charge packet is spilled .",
    "the amount of charge is controlled by the offset voltage between the input gate and the next electrode ( s3 ) . in the normal xis operations ,",
    "this fill - and - spill cycle is repeated every 1/40960  sec @xmath10 24  @xmath6sec .",
    "the deposited charge packets ( @xmath1s ) in the charge injection register are vertically transferred into the imaging area by the same clocking pattern as that of x - ray events .",
    "a part of the packet ( @xmath3 ) will be trapped by the charge traps during the transfer .",
    "after the launch , because @xmath3 is not negligible due to the increase of charge traps , only @xmath2 can be measured with a injection of single charge packet and the normal readout . on the other hand ,",
    "we need the measurement of @xmath3 in order to estimate the cti .",
    "we hence adopt the following injection pattern , with which we can obtain both values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 simultaneously as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : ciimage ] . after injecting a _ test _ charge packet of @xmath1 in one row ( horizontal transfer channel ) , we inject packets with the same amount of @xmath1 in five subsequent rows : the preceding four packets are called the _ sacrificial _ charge packets and",
    "the last one is the _ reference _ charge packet .",
    "the _ test _",
    "charge packet is separated from trains of _ sacrificial _",
    "charge packets to allow the event detection algorithm @xcite .",
    "the _ test _ charge packet may suffer from traps in the transfer channel ( column ) , and therefore , the readout charge ( @xmath11 ) should be @xmath1  @xmath3 . on the other hand , since the preceding _ sacrificial _ charge packets may fill the charge traps , the subsequent _ reference _ charge packet may not be trapped if the clocking time is shorter than the de - trapping time scale @xcite .",
    "thus , the readout charge ( @xmath12 ) from the _ reference _ charge packet should be approximately equal to @xmath1 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : ciimage ] shows a frame image taken during our experiments .",
    "the positions of the charge packet trains are periodically shifted by one column to allow the proper event detection algorithm .",
    "the _ sacrificial _",
    "charge packets are not read because of the same reason .",
    "the value @xmath3 after the transfer can be measured by subtracting the mean pulse height amplitude ( pha ) of the _ test _ events from that of the _ reference _ events . by selecting different @xmath1s",
    ", we can also investigate the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "before the launch of suzaku , we conducted the ground experiments with the same type of ccd chip as the xis in order to verify the performance of charge injection function .",
    "the ccd chip was damaged by protons utilizing the cyclotron at the northeast proton therapy center at boston ( usa ) .",
    "proton beam of 40  mev was irradiated on the circular region shown in figure  [ fig : frameimg ] .",
    "the total fluence was 2.0 @xmath7 10@xmath13  @xmath14 , which is approximately the same as that the xis may receive during several years in orbit .",
    "experiments with damaged and non - damaged chips were conducted in mit and kyoto university respectively , using the fluorescent x - ray generation system ( @xcite for the latter ) and a @xmath9fe radioisotope . during these experiments , the sensors were maintained at a pressure of @xmath010@xmath15  torr and a ccd temperature of 90  @xmath8c . in this paper",
    ", we report on the results of the fi chip , because the quantitative differences between the fi and bi chips are small .",
    "the in - orbit charge injection experiment was conducted in the observations of the supernova remnant ( snr ) 1e010272.3 in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "all the data were acquired with the normal clocking mode and with the 3@xmath73 or 5@xmath75 editing modes @xcite .",
    "we applied several values of @xmath1 in order to investigate the dependance of @xmath3 on @xmath1 .",
    "table  [ tab : explog ] summarizes the experimental logs .",
    "lcc    ' '' ''    & xis0 & xis2 & xis1 & xis3 +    ' '' ''    date & 2006/7/17 & 2006/6/26 - 27 +    ' '' ''    time & 06:06:50 - 21:39:46 & 02:47:07 - 02:37:55 +    ' '' ''    the equivalent x - ray energy & 0.6/4.2/8.0 for xis0 & 0.3/7.3 for xis1 +    ' '' ''    of the injected charge packets ( kev ) & 0.6/3.9/7.8 for xis2 & 0.5/4.6 for xis3 +    ' '' ''    total effective exposure ( ksec ) & 6.0 & 5.2 +",
    "in order to reliably estimate @xmath3 , @xmath1 in _ reference _ and _ test _ events must be equal , because @xmath3 is the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath1 can be controlled more accurately than that of charge dispersion of x - ray events in each column , the charge injection offers obvious advantages over conventional cti measurements using x - ray calibration sources .",
    "we hence check the stability of @xmath11 when a designed offset voltage is applied at the input gate . for this propose ,",
    "we use the non - damaged chip , because @xmath11 should be nearly equal to @xmath1 due to the negligible number of charge traps .",
    "figure  [ fig : stability ] shows the spectra of fluorescent x - rays ( ti k@xmath16 ) collected on ground and @xmath11 of approximately the same equivalent energy as x - rays collected both on ground before proton damage and in orbit after the damage .",
    "events are extracted from one arbitrary column for all the data sets .",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath11 is 91@xmath174 ev for ground data and 95@xmath176 ev for in - orbit data , that are significantly better than that of the x - ray data of 113@xmath177 ev .",
    "the former fwhms mean the stability of @xmath18 of the charge injection under the controlled offset voltage at the input gate , and the latter is primarily due to the fano noise .",
    "thus , we verify that @xmath18 is sufficiently stable to estimate @xmath19 .",
    "next , we investigate whether the ratio of @xmath20 is proportional to the cti , which is measured with the @xmath9fe calibration x - rays",
    ". the pha histograms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are fitted with a single gaussian for each column . for the @xmath9fe events , we extract the events from upper and lower 100 rows of the imaging area ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "the 100 rows are selected for the statistical point of view in the spectral fitting .",
    "figure  [ fig : correlation ] shows the correlations between @xmath20 and @xmath23 . for the non - damaged chip ( the left panel ) , because @xmath3 during the parallel transfer is 0 or 1 electron , the correlation can be hardly seen . for the damaged - chip ,",
    "on the other hand , the increase of cti is significant in the circular region as shown in figure  [ fig : frameimg ] .",
    "we can see a clear positive correlation between the @xmath9fe and charge injection events , especially in segment a , b , and c. the best - fit slope is @xmath01.05 and the correlation coefficient is 0.94 ( d.o.f.=976 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath20 properly reflects the cti@xmath24 .      based on the verification for the charge injection technique in section [ subsec : stability ]",
    ", we apply this technique to the onboard data .",
    "figure  [ fig : reftest ] shows the pha distribution for @xmath12 ( open circle ) and @xmath11 ( cross ) as a function of x - coordinate ( column )",
    ". the @xmath19 is clearly observed in orbit for the first time . in order to estimate the @xmath3 dependance on @xmath1 , we selected two or three different @xmath1 values for the in - orbit charge injection experiment ( table  [ tab : explog ] ) . assuming the single power law function of @xmath25 as in @xcite",
    ", we derive @xmath16 for each column .",
    "the results are given in figure  [ fig : lostvspha ] .",
    "the weighted mean values of @xmath16 are 0.62 , 0.71 , 0.62 , and 1.00 for the xis0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively",
    ". these values are roughly consistent with another ground experiment @xcite .",
    "the charge injection data provide only the information on the @xmath3 at the edge of the imaging area and hence we need to know the y coordinate dependance of @xmath3 from the data of celestial objects that extend over the field of view of the xis .",
    "figure  [ fig : sgrcactydep ] shows the center energy of the 6.4 kev line as a function of the y coordinate for the diffuse x - rays from the sgr  c region ( obs .",
    "sequence = 500018010 , obs .",
    "date = 2006 - 02 - 20 ) .",
    "the line center at the lower edge of the image ( y=0 ) deviates from 6.40 kev due to the cti during the fast transfer of all the data in the imaging area to the frame - store region ( hereafter we call this frame - store - transfer ) .",
    "however , the origin of the deviations at the other image regions is complicated because the charges suffer from three kinds of the cti : the cti in the imaging area due to the frame - store - transfer , that in the frame - store region due to the the frame - store - transfer and that in the frame - store region due to the subsequent slow vertical transfer .",
    "the cti during the horizontal transfer is ignored in this work .",
    "the cti depends on the number density of charge traps and the transfer speed @xcite .",
    "the shielding depth and pixel size are different in the imaging area and frame - store region .",
    "the ctis therefore may be different between these areas .",
    "however , we can not estimate each cti component separately from the total cti seen in figure  [ fig : sgrcactydep ] .    due to this limitation , we assume following phenomenological compensation of the charge as shown in figure  [ fig : deltaq ] .",
    "the charge loss during the transfer is assumed to consists of a component depending on y ( @xmath26 ) and a y - independent one ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "both components are proportional to @xmath28 , but their proportionality constants may be different from each other . considering that the @xmath1 is generated by an x - ray absorbed at @xmath29 , the column - averaged charge loss of @xmath30",
    "is given by @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be estimated from figure [ fig : sgrcactydep ] .",
    "we next determined the column - dependent charge loss of @xmath34 so that the following relation holds at any y coordinate .",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 can be estimated from figure  [ fig : reftest ] .",
    "hence we can compensate charge correctly in the entire region of the imaging area .      without a cti correction ,",
    "the energy resolution gradually decreases at a rate of @xmath0  50  ev in fwhm @ 5.9  kev per year . using the @xmath19 determined with the charge injection experiment",
    ", we make the new spectra for the calibration sources in the observation given in table  [ tab : explog ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cispectra ] shows the calibration source spectra after the cti@xmath37 ( upper ) and cti@xmath38 ( lower ) correction .",
    "the tail component after the cti@xmath37 correction is significantly reduced compared to that after the cti@xmath38 correction .",
    "this strongly indicates that the origin of the tail component is the dispersion of the cti@xmath24 among columns .",
    "hence the temporal variation in the response function can be suppressed by the charge injection technique .",
    "figure  [ fig : eneres ] shows the fwhm of the calibration source spectra after the cti@xmath37 and cti@xmath38 correction . on average , the fwhm is significantly improved from 193 ev to 173 ev .",
    "these are the first in - orbit results for the charge injection function .",
    "our final purpose is to demonstrate that @xmath19 parameters are effective for celestial objects .",
    "we apply the @xmath19 parameters to the tycho s snr data ( obs . sequence = 500024010 , obs .",
    "date = 2006 - 06 - 27 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : tychosika ] shows the spectra around the he - like si k@xmath16 emission line in the west part of tycho s snr for the xis3 after the cti@xmath37 correction and cti@xmath38 correction .",
    "we see the same benefit as shown in figure  [ fig : cispectra ] .",
    "note that the latter is multiplied by 0.8 to avoid confusion .",
    "radiation damage continuously increases while in orbit , and hence , the benefit of the charge injection technique will become more apparent over time as shown in this figure .",
    "because the cti@xmath37 correction parameters are time dependent , @xmath19 must be periodically measured .",
    "we make two sets of cti@xmath37 using @xmath19 derived from the charge injection experiment in may and july 2006 , and apply to the calibration source data taken in may 2006 for the xis0 and xis2 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : longterm ] .",
    "the average cti in july is normalized to that in may , while the relative variation in cti@xmath37 is preserved .",
    "while the observation time of the charge injection and @xmath9fe data differs by two months , the fwhm is significantly degraded only for the brightest calibration source .",
    "this confirms that , in practical sense , the interval of two months between each cti measurement is sufficient because there are few celestial objects which has emission line brighter than this calibration source .",
    "although the charge injection technique significantly improves the energy resolution of the calibration source spectra , the fwhms , as shown in figure  [ fig : eneres ] , are still larger than those before the launch ( 130  ev ) . because the charge trapping is a probability process",
    ", the number of trapped electrons ( @xmath3 ) may also have a probability deviation , which would increase the line width after the transfer .",
    "hence the cti correction with charge injection technique can not completely restore the line broadening .",
    "we confirm this effect in figure  [ fig : sighikaku ] , which shows the fwhm of the charge injection _ reference _ events and those of the _ test _ events before and after the charge compensation for the xis3 in - orbit data .",
    "in addition , the _ test _ events measured on ground ( before the radiation damage ) are shown .",
    "the smaller fwhms in all segments of the _ reference _ events are due to the fact that the _ reference _ events may not lose charge because the charge traps are already filled by the _",
    "sacrificial _ events .",
    "in fact , the fwhms of the _ reference _ events are consistent with those of the _ test _ events collected on ground although segment d show anomalous trend .",
    "another characteristic of figure  [ fig : sighikaku ] is that the fwhms increase along with x coordinate for the _ reference _ events and _ test _ events collected on ground .",
    "this is due to the cti in the charge injection register .",
    "this influences the accuracy of the mean pha of the _ reference _ events and hence the accuracy of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the cti in the charge injection register is rather lower than that in the imaging area and frame - store region because the charge packets are injected with an interval of 3 pixels and hence they can work as _ sacrificial _",
    "charges @xcite .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure  [ fig : eneres ] , there is no significant difference between segment a and d for the improvement of the fwhm of the calibration source spectra .",
    "these results lead us to use the charge injection capability to fill the traps in the transfer channel by periodically injection of @xmath1 .",
    "a ground experiment shows that charges injected into every 54@xmath4 row improve the energy resolution @xcite .",
    "we are trying to utilize this charge injection technique for the onboard observations .",
    "the results will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "the results of ground and in - orbit experiments of the charge injection capability of the xis are as follows :    1 .",
    "the amount of injected charge ( @xmath1 ) is sufficiently stable ( dispersion of 91  ev in fwhm ) , which should be compared to the x - ray energy resolution ( fwhm of 113  ev ) with the same amount of charge .",
    "the cti depends on pha of the charge .",
    "the charge loss can be explained as @xmath39 3 .   with the cti@xmath37 correction , the energy resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath9fe",
    "is improved compared to that with the cti@xmath38 correction ( from 193  ev to 173  ev on an average ) at the time of one year after the launch and the tail component in the line profile is also significantly reduced .",
    "the improved charge compensation method is applied to the tycho s snr data , which results in the same benefit as the calibration source data .",
    "we confirm that the energy resolution can be largely improved by filling the charge trap .",
    "hence , we are currently trying another in - orbit charge injection capability experiment to actively fill the charge traps in the transfer channel by the charge injection technique .",
