    "<S> the unique optoelectronic properties of graphene  @xcite make it an ideal platform for a variety of photonic applications  @xcite , including fast photodetectors  @xcite , transparent electrodes  @xcite , optical modulators  @xcite , and ultra - fast lasers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> owing to its high carrier mobility , gapless spectrum , and frequency - independent absorption coefficient , it has been recognized as a very promising element for the development of detectors and modulators operating in the terahertz ( thz ) region of the electromagnetic spectrum ( wavelengths in the hundreds of @xmath0 range ) , which is still severely lacking in terms of solid - state devices . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate efficient thz detectors based on antenna - coupled graphene field - effect transistors ( fets ) . </S>",
    "<S> these exploit the non - linear fet response to the oscillating radiation field at the gate electrode , with contributions of thermoelectric and photoconductive origin . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate room temperature ( rt ) operation at @xmath1 , with noise equivalent power ( nep ) levels @xmath2 , showing that our devices are well beyond a proof - of - concept phase and can already be used in a realistic setting , enabling large area , fast imaging of macroscopic samples .    </S>",
    "<S> photodetection of far - infrared radiation ( from hundreds of ghz to a few thz ) is technologically important for a wide range of potential applications spanning from medical diagnostics to process control , and homeland security  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thz radiation penetrates through numerous commonly used dielectric materials , otherwise opaque for visible and mid - infrared light . at the same time it allows spectroscopic identification of hazardous substances and compounds through their characteristic molecular fingerprints  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> commercially available thz detectors are based on thermal sensing elements being either very slow ( @xmath3 modulation frequency ) ( golay cells , pyroelectric elements ) , or requiring deep cryogenic cooling ( @xmath4 ) ( superconducting hot - electron bolometers )  @xcite , while those exploiting fast non - linear electronics ( schottky diodes ) are mostly limited to the range below @xmath5  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a more recent approach exploits fets [ 9 ] , either as iii - v high - electron - mobility transistors ( hemts ) or si - based complementary metal - oxide - semiconductors ( cmoss ) . </S>",
    "<S> these devices provide excellent sensitivities ( nep in the @xmath6 range depending on temperature and operation frequency ) , with the intrinsic possibility of high - speed response ( in principle just limited by the read - out electronics impedance ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been also demonstrated with self - assembled inas nanowires , allowing rt thz detection with neps of @xmath7 at @xmath1  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thz detection in fets is mediated by the excitation of plasma waves in the transistor channel  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , a strong resonant photoresponse is predicted in materials having plasma damping rates lower than both the frequency of the incoming radiation and the electron transit time in the transistor channel . </S>",
    "<S> this requires electron mobilities of at least a few thousand @xmath8 at frequencies above @xmath5 . under these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> stationary states arise from the quantization of plasma waves over the gate length . </S>",
    "<S> however , this concept was never demonstrated at room temperature . furthermore , even though some results have been achieved at cryogenic temperatures  @xcite , thus far </S>",
    "<S> no clear - cut evidence was reported for the expected large responsivity enhancement . on the other hand , when plasma oscillations are overdamped , broadband thz detection is observed  @xcite . in this case , the oscillating electric field of the incoming radiation applied between source and gate electrodes produces a modulation of both charge density and carrier drift velocity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> carriers traveling towards the drain generate a continuous source - drain voltage @xmath9 , which is controlled by the carrier density in the channel , and can be then maximized by varying the gate voltage .    </S>",
    "<S> a material having high carrier mobility at rt is crucial to take full advantage of the performance enhancement expected from resonant detection , and to make fet detectors equally performant at operating frequencies @xmath10  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the naturally occurring two - dimensional electron gas in a doped graphene sheet has a very high mobility even at rt  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , it supports plasma waves  @xcite which are weakly damped  @xcite in high - quality samples . </S>",
    "<S> thus , graphene fet plasma - based photodetectors could outperform other thz detection technologies  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , the development of graphene - based photodetectors has been limited to the near - infrared region , exploiting the creation of electron - hole pairs following light absorption  @xcite . in the thz range , however , the photon energy is just a few @xmath11 , and light absorption is prevented by pauli blocking from unavoidable doping of as - produced graphene samples  @xcite or charge inhomogeneities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cryogenic graphene bolometers have also been recently developed and their operation demonstrated in the mid - ir  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate efficient , rt thz detectors , by combining top - gated graphene fets with thz receiver architectures designed to achieve the desired device sensitivity . when a thz radiation beam is focused on a fet channel , the incoming optical wave is rectified , leading to a dc signal @xmath9 between source and drain , proportional to the received optical power  @xcite . to induce a detectable photovoltage signal across the fet , </S>",
    "<S> an asymmetry between source and drain contacts is needed , for example in feeding the incoming radiation . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved either by an asymmetric design of source and drain contacts or by using low shunt - capacitance antennas to funnel the radiation into the strongly sub - wavelength detecting element . </S>",
    "<S> antenna coupling ensures a selective responsivity to both the spatial mode and the polarization of the incoming radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> we use graphene exfoliated on @xmath12 ( see methods ) and lithographically define a single lobe of a log - periodic circular - toothed antenna  @xcite as source contact , with an outer radius of @xmath13 , while the drain is a metal line running to the bonding pad . a second identical antenna lobe acting as top - gate contact is then defined by e - beam lithography , after depositing _ via _ atomic layer deposition a @xmath14 thick @xmath15 insulating layer . </S>",
    "<S> the channel length is between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , while the gate length ( @xmath18 ) is @xmath19 or @xmath20 depending on the device . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : one ] shows a microscope image of a fabricated graphene fet , embedded within a schematic representation of the thz detection configuration .     </S>",
    "<S> is patterned between the source and gate contacts , while the drain is a metal line running to the bonding pad . </S>",
    "<S> the channel length is @xmath21 , while the gate length ( @xmath18 ) is @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic ( cr / au ) top - gate is patterned in the middle of the graphene channel with standard electron - beam lithography and lift - off technique after atomic - layer deposition of a @xmath22-thick @xmath15 insulating layer . </S>",
    "<S> an electromagnetic simulation using a finite - element method ( fem ) software ( ansoft hfss ) to calculate the resonance frequencies of the log - periodic antenna ( without the bow - tie element ) leads to resonant frequencies close to @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath5 , and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the thz radiation at @xmath1 is focused on the bow - tie device by off - axis parabolic mirrors with an optical power of @xmath26 and a spot size with a diameter of roughly @xmath27 microns . </S>",
    "<S> inset : scanning electron microscope image of the monolayer graphene fet.[fig : one ] ]    figures  [ fig : two](a ) and  [ fig : two](c ) show the conductivity ( @xmath28 ) extracted from the current ( @xmath29 ) measured at rt in monolayer ( slg ) and bilayer ( blg ) graphene devices , respectively , while sweeping the gate voltage ( @xmath30 ) from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and keeping the source - drain voltage at @xmath33 . in both cases , as expected  @xcite , varying the gate voltage , the conductivity goes through a minimum when the chemical potential below the gate is tuned across the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) . in both samples , </S>",
    "<S> the cnp is located at positive gate voltages , underlying the p - doping of our graphene samples consistent with the doping level measured by raman spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> note that in our devices the gate electrode length is much smaller than the source - drain distance . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , in general , one can not simply assume the measured resistance to be fully dominated by that of the gated region .    . </S>",
    "<S> the drain contact was connected to a current amplifier converting the current into a voltage signal with an amplification factor of @xmath34 ; ( b , d ) derivative of the device conductivity as a function of the gate voltage @xmath30 , plotted once multiplied for the device resistance . </S>",
    "<S> this curve represents the expected device responsivity following a diffusive model of transport as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and in the methods . </S>",
    "<S> the change of sign occurs as @xmath30 is swept through the charge neutrality point . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : two ] ]    a diffusive model ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and methods ) of transport predicts a second - order non - linear response when an oscillating thz field is applied between gate and source of our fets . </S>",
    "<S> this model yields a photovoltage @xmath9 proportional to the derivative of the channel conductivity with respect to the gate bias : [ eq : deltau ] u  . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig : two](b)-(d ) show the predicted photovoltage as a function of gate bias for the slg ( [ fig : two]b ) and blg ( [ fig : two]d ) , as inferred from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : deltau ] ) , using as an input the measured gate - voltage - dependent conductivity @xmath35 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath9 varies from negative to positive , while crossing the cnp , consistent with the ambipolar nature of charge carrier transport in graphene  @xcite .    to access the photoresponse , we shine the @xmath1 radiation generated by an electronic source based on frequency multipliers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation is collimated and focused by a set of two f / l off - axis parabolic mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity is mechanically chopped at frequencies varying between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and @xmath9 is measured by means of a lock - in amplifier in series with a voltage preamplifier having an input impedance of @xmath38 and an amplification factor @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the vertically polarized incoming radiation impinges from the free space onto the graphene devices mounted on a dual - in - line package with an optical power @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the photoresponse is measured at zero applied @xmath41 , as a dc voltage at the drain , while the source is grounded . </S>",
    "<S> the responsivity @xmath42 is extracted from the measured @xmath9 by using the relation : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the radiation beam spot area and @xmath45 is the active area  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this definition of @xmath42 assumes that the whole power incident on the antenna is effectively coupled to the graphene fet . in our case , the relatively high device impedance results in a mismatch with the antenna output ( @xmath46 or lower ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus likely that a considerable fraction of the radiation field is not funneled into the device . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our @xmath42 values have to be considered as lower limit estimations . given our radiation beam spot diameter @xmath47 , we get @xmath48 . since the total area of our device , including antenna and contact pads , is smaller than the diffraction - limited area @xmath49 , we take the active area to be @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the induced @xmath9 was then extracted from the measured lock - in signal @xmath51 , without any correction from the amplifier input load  @xcite : u =  l  , where the factor @xmath52 is due to the peak - to - peak magnitude , the factor @xmath53 originates from the lock - in amplifier rms amplitude , and @xmath54 is the fundamental sine wave fourier component of the square wave produced by the chopper .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : three](a ) plots @xmath42 of the slg - based fet as a function of @xmath30 , while modulating the thz source at @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> different curves correspond to different relative orientations between the source electric - field polarization and the antenna axis . </S>",
    "<S> the photoresponse drops rapidly with angle until it becomes almost zero when the incoming beam polarization is orthogonal to the antenna axis , confirming the efficacy of our dipole antenna . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath30 is in qualitative agreement with the behavior shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : two](b ) , thereby proving that in the present conditions our detectors are operating in the broadband overdamped regime . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we note that the sign of the photovoltage changes quite abruptly in the vicinity of the cnp , following the switch of sign of the derivative @xmath56 .     at room temperature , for single - layer graphene ( a ) as function of the angle between the polarization axis of the beam and the antenna axis , and for bilayer graphene ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data are extracted from the measured photo - induced voltages across source and drain as described in the text . </S>",
    "<S> the incoming @xmath1 beam is modulated at @xmath55 and impinges from the free space onto the graphene devices mounted on the dual - in - line package with an incident optical power @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : three ] ]    we also note that an additional sign switch appears around @xmath57 in all curves . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a contribution to the photoresponse of thermoelectric origin  @xcite , arising from the presence of the ungated p - doped graphene regions , and subsequent formation of p - p - p or p - n - p junctions , depending on the gate bias value . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that , owing to the presence of the antenna , the electronic distribution near the junction between gate and source is more effectively  heated \" by the incoming radiation , either through free - carrier ( drude - like ) absorption or indirectly from the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting thermoelectric voltage should have the same functional dependence as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : deltau ] ) but opposite sign , plus a roughly gate - independent value , determined by the thermoelectric seeback coefficient of the ungated graphene region  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should thus change sign near zero gate bias , following the sign of the difference between the thermoelectric coefficients across the junction , as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our device reaches @xmath58 , when the source is modulated at @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the presence of competing detection mechanisms , each characterized by distinctive response timescales . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative evaluation of each individual contribution is , however , presently difficult , due to their similar functional dependence . as inferred from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : deltau ] ) , in the overdamped regime , @xmath42 is determined by the relative change of conductivity with @xmath30 ; in fact , in this first implementation , our @xmath42 is almost one order of magnitude lower than that of nanowire fets with identical antenna geometries  @xcite , but with an on - off current ratio at least one order of magnitude larger .    figure  [ fig : three](b ) plots @xmath42 as a function of @xmath30 in the blg - based fet , while modulating the thz source at @xmath55 . the measured shape of the @xmath42 curve is in excellent agreement with that predicted by the diffusive plasma - wave detection model [ see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : two](d ) ] , up to the cnp point . however , no change of sign is measured at the cnp , and a response strongly enhanced with respect to that predicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : deltau ] ) appears for @xmath30 larger than the cnp , when the device is in the p - n - p configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests an additional contribution to the photovoltage , this time of constant sign . </S>",
    "<S> its magnitude grows rapidly with gate bias , eventually dominating in the regime in which a p - n - p junction is present . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the photovoltage is noisier above the cnp , implying an additional intrinsic noise mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively link this behaviour to interband transitions driven by the thz field at the p - n junction , with the resulting generation - recombination noise . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , this contribution , only seen in blg , may be related to the higher density of states near the dirac point , or to the opening of an energy gap due to the electric field , with the thz field possibly adding an energy gap modulation . </S>",
    "<S> whatever the precise origin , this leads to @xmath59 , when the source is modulated at @xmath37 , values even larger than those resulting from the broadband plasma response .    . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : four ] ]    from the application perspective , the relevant figure of merit to characterize a photodetector is the nep , which corresponds to the lowest detectable power in a @xmath60 output bandwidth ( or equivalently a @xmath61 integration time ) . </S>",
    "<S> the noise level of fet detectors is dominated by the thermal johnson - nyquist contribution  @xcite , expressed as @xmath62 , and can then be extracted directly from the measured conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the nep is then simply obtained dividing this value by the detector responsivity @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig : four](a ) and  ( b ) plot our best measured neps as functions of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum rt nep is @xmath63 for slg , and almost one order of magnitude lower ( @xmath64 ) for blg . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is expected in view of the higher responsivity of the latter , combined with its higher conductivity ( translating into lower noise ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such numbers are in fact upper limits , and since they refer to the signal power incident on the device as a whole ( optical nep ) , _ i.e. _ are not corrected for the coupling efficiency of the radiation into the nano - sized transistor element , which is likely very low in our present configuration . </S>",
    "<S> care must be taken when comparing optical nep values with those derived from the signal power actually absorbed in the detector ( electrical nep ) , used for example to describe the mid - ir cryogenic bolometers of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous rt fet detectors based on inas nanowires achieved optical neps @xmath65  @xcite , while si n - moss reach @xmath66  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why our devices have higher neps stems from the higher @xmath42 enabled by the current on - off ratio of the highly mature si cmos technology , exceeding @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus expect significant performance improvements to be possible for our graphene fet detectors , even in the overdamped low - frequency regime , for example by reducing the device resistance with shorter channels and raising the mobilities , improving at the same time the coupling with the antenna . </S>",
    "<S> we also remark the possibility recently demonstrated to reach on - off current ratios as high as @xmath68 in cvd - grown blg fets  @xcite .    in any case </S>",
    "<S> , our devices are already exploitable , for instance , for large area fast imaging . as test object we used coffee capsules ( aluminum foil ) inside a cardboard box . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : five ] shows the thz image profile , consisting of @xmath69 scanned points , collected by raster - scanning the object in the beam focus , with an integration time of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the coffee capsules as well as the air gaps between them appear clearly in the thz image with a reasonably good spatial resolution . a transmission image of a fresh , green leaf </S>",
    "<S> is also shown [ see panel ( d ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : five ] ] .     transmission mode image of it ( b ) measured at room temperature with a bilayer - graphene - based fet at @xmath71 , mounted on a xy translation stage having a spatial resolution of @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the thz image consists of @xmath69 scanned points , collected by raster - scanning the object in the beam focus , with an integration time of @xmath70 ; ( d ) @xmath73 transmission mode image of a leaf measured under the same experimental conditions.[fig : five ] ]    our slg and blg - based fet detectors can also be used to investigate more fundamental physics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the weakly - damped limit , they may allow to probe the hydrodynamic behavior of  chiral \" electron plasmas and their non - linear instabilities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , blg fets with narrow top gates are particularly suited to unravel the interplay between photo - excited plasma - wave transport and intriguing phenomena such as chirality - assisted electronic cloaking  @xcite and zener - tunneling - induced negative differential conductivity  @xcite .    </S>",
