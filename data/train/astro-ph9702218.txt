    "the large scale structure of the universe is believed to have developed from small perturbations ( usually assumed to be gaussian ) of the matter density field by gravitational instabilities . under these assumptions",
    "the clustering pattern and velocity field observed today are determined by the initial conditions via the perturbation power spectrum [ @xmath0 and the cosmological parameters such as @xmath1 , the cosmic density parameter .",
    "it is therefore possible to derive constraints on model parameters from the observed density and velocity distributions of galaxies .",
    "there are two fundamental problems to be addressed : first , since the galaxy distribution may be biased relative to the mass density field , we need to understand such bias before making meaningful comparisons between models and observations .",
    "second , even if the observed galaxy distribution traces the matter distribution , we still need to understand how the observed distribution is related to a cosmogonical model .",
    "this is by no means trivial , because the clustering pattern and velocity field observed today are nonlinear .",
    "n - body simulations are usually invoked to find a solution to these problems . however , such simulations are limited both in resolution and in dynamical range , and can be difficult to interpret .",
    "our understanding of the underlying physics can be greatly enhanced by simple physical models and the analytic approximations they provide . in this article",
    "we summarize some of our recent progress in connection to the problems mentioned above .",
    "we show that successful semianalytic models can be constructed for the clustering of both dark matter and dark matter haloes .",
    "such models can enhance significantly our understanding of both the nonlinear evolution of galaxy clustering and galaxy biasing .",
    "the models present below are for cdm - like cosmogonies .",
    "the cosmology is described by the cosmological matter density ( @xmath1 ) , the cosmological constant ( @xmath2 ) and the hubble constant ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the initial power spectrum is [ one ] p(k ) , t(k)=ln(1 + 2.34q)2.34 q 1 + 3.89 q+(16.1q)^2+(5.46q)^3+(6.71q)^4 ^-1/4 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( bardeen et al . 1986 ) .",
    "the rms mass fluctuation in top - hat windows with radius @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is defined by ^2 ( r)=_0^^2(k ) w^2(kr ) , where @xmath8 is the fourier transform of the top - hat window function , and ^2(k)= ( 1/ 2 ^ 2 ) k^3p(k ) is the power variance .",
    "we normalize @xmath9 by specifying @xmath10 .",
    "the _ evolved _ two - point correlation function @xmath11 is related to the _ evolved _ power variance @xmath12 by ( r)=_0^ ^2(k ) krkr .",
    "thus , in order to get @xmath13 we need an expression for @xmath14 . following the original argument of hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , jain , mo & white ( 1995 ) , padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and peacock & dodds ( 1996 , hereafter pd ) have obtained fitting formulae which relate @xmath15 to @xmath9 for a given cosmological model .",
    "the latest version of such a fitting formula is given in pd .",
    "the solid curve in fig.1 shows the prediction of such a formula for @xmath13 in the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see mo , jing & brner 1997 , hereafter mjb , for details ) . comparing it with the n - body results ,",
    "we see clearly that the fitting formula works well .",
    "this is true for various other cosmogonic models studied .",
    "the redshift evolution of the two - point correlation function is usually parametrized by the form ( r , z)=(r,0)(1+z)^-(3 + _ ) , where @xmath20 is the amplitude of the two - point correlation function at _ physical _ radius @xmath21 at redshift @xmath22 , @xmath23 is a parameter to describe the time evolution . if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 for the linear growth in an einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath26 for clustering patterns fixed in comoving space , and @xmath27 for stable clustering ( i.e. clustering patterns fixed in proper coordinates ) .",
    "given the model in  3.1 , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath23 .",
    "2 shows @xmath23 as a function of @xmath22 for open cosmologies with various @xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 at @xmath22 is obtained by fitting @xmath28 in the redshift interval , @xmath29 .",
    "the evolution is more rapid ( i.e. @xmath23 larger ) for universes with larger @xmath1 , since linear structures grow faster in a high-@xmath1 universe . for high @xmath1 ,",
    "the evolution is faster at @xmath30 , because of nonlinear evolution . at late time",
    "when clustering on @xmath31 becomes stable , the evolution becomes slower .      from the pair conservation equation ( peebles 1980 , ",
    "71 ) , the ensemble ( pair weighted ) average of the pairwise peculiar velocity @xmath32\\cdot { \\hat { \\br}}\\rangle$ ] can be written as = -13 1 ( y , a ) a , where @xmath21 is the proper , and @xmath33 the comoving , separation between the pairs ; @xmath34 is the hubble s constant at expansion factor @xmath35 ; @xmath36 .",
    "thus , to obtain @xmath37 , we need to work out @xmath38 .",
    "this can be done directly from the fitting formula of @xmath39 ( see mjb ) .",
    "3 shows the comparison between the model prediction and the simulation results for the scdm model .",
    "the agreement between the two is remarkably good , and this is true for many other cosmogonic models studied .",
    "the ( density weighted ) mean square peculiar velocity of mass particles @xmath40 is related to the two - point correlation function by the cosmic energy equation : [ x.8 ] dda a^2v_1 ^ 2=4 g a^3 i_2(a)a , where @xmath41 is the mean density of the universe , and i_2(a)_0^ydy(y , a)=_0^. integrating eqn .",
    "( [ x.8 ] ) once , we have [ x.10 ] v_1 ^ 2=32(a ) h^2(a)a^2i_2(a ) 1 - 1a i_2(a)_0^a i_2(a ) da . in the linear case ,",
    "@xmath42 , where @xmath43 [ @xmath44 is the linear growth factor ; @xmath45 and [ x.11 ] v_1 ^ 2=32(a ) h^2(a ) a^2 i_2(a ) 1 - 1ad^2(a)_0^a d^2(a ) da . we found that eqn.([x.11 ] ) is a good approximation ( to an error of @xmath46 ) to eqn.([x.10 ] ) for all realistic cases .",
    "thus , for a given cosmogonic model , we can easily obtain @xmath40 .",
    "for various cosmogonies , the model predictions fit the simulation results to an accuracy better than 10 percent ( see mjb ) .",
    "the relative velocity dispersion of particle pairs of separation @xmath21 is defined as @xmath47 ^ 2\\rangle ^{1/2}$ ] . in fig .",
    "4 we show ( by symbols ) the dispersion of the pairwise peculiar velocities projected along the separations of particle pairs [ @xmath48 in the n - body simulations .",
    "the main features of @xmath49 are ( a ) monotonic rise at small @xmath21 ; ( b ) saturation at large @xmath21 ; ( c ) a maximum at medium @xmath21 . as shown in mjb , these features can all be explained by physical arguments .",
    "based on the n - body results we make the following ansatz for @xmath50 : ^1/2=^0.5hr_c(r",
    "/ r_c ) , where @xmath51 is a universal function and @xmath52 is a nonlinear scale .",
    "we choose @xmath52 to be the virial radius of @xmath53 haloes , @xmath54 . for a given power spectrum ,",
    "the linear radius of @xmath53 haloes , @xmath55 , is given by @xmath56 .",
    "the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 in different cosmological models can be obtained analytically , as discussed in detail in mjb .",
    "we approximate the functional form of @xmath57 by : ( x)=_(1+bx^-)+ax^- 1+v[g(a)]^0.35 [ ( a)]^0.2x^-(+ ) , where @xmath58 ; @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are constant .",
    "@xmath50 is forced to have the large separation asymptotic value for uncorrelated pairs . for @xmath64 , @xmath65 so that it increases with @xmath21 as a power law .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "4 shows the prediction of our fitting formula with a=58.67 ; b=-0.3770 ; v=4.434 ; = 2.25 ; = 1.90 ; = 0.15 .",
    "the fit to the simulation data is reasonably good .",
    "so far we have discussed the clustering properties of dark matter . to compare model predictions with the observed galaxy distribution , we also need to understand how the galaxy distribution is related to the dark matter distribution .",
    "the bias of the galaxy distribution relative to the mass distribution can be obtained once we know how galaxies form in the mass density field . however",
    ", some progress can still be made before the details of galaxy formation is understood . in the standard scenario of galaxy formation , a gravitationally dominant dissipationless component of dark matter is assumed to aggregate into dark matter clumps ( dark matter haloes ) , galaxies then form by the cooling and condensation of gas within these dark haloes ( e.g. kauffmann 1997 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to approach the problem of galaxy biasing by first understanding how dark matter haloes are distributed relative to the mass . in the following we show that simple analytic models for such relations can be constructed ( see mo & white 1996 , mw ) .",
    "we define dark matter haloes as virialized clumps of dark matter . in the spherical collapse model , a dark matter halo",
    "is characterized by its mass , @xmath66 , and the redshift , @xmath22 , when it is assembled . to describe the relation between halo and mass distributions",
    "we define a bias relation , [ y.1 ] _",
    "h(r)=b(r , , m , z)(r ) , where @xmath67/   { \\overline \\rho}$ ] is the overdensity of matter in a sphere of radius @xmath6 , @xmath68 is the same overdensity for dark matter haloes .",
    "suppose the conditional density of dark matter haloes within a sphere of radius @xmath6 is @xmath69 .",
    "( this is the number density of dark matter haloes within a sphere of radius @xmath6 , given that the mean mass overdensity within this sphere is @xmath70 . )",
    "the bias relation can then be written as _",
    "h(m , z , r)=n_h(m , z , r)_h(m , z)-1 , where @xmath71 is the mean number density of haloes in the universe , given by the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 , ps ) : _",
    "h(m , z)dm=- dm , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the conditional density , @xmath69 , can be obtained by an extension of the ps formalism ( e.g. bower 1991 ) : @xmath75^{3/2 } }   { d\\sigma(r)\\over dm } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp\\left\\{-{(\\delta_z-\\delta_0)^2\\over 2[\\sigma^2(r)-\\sigma^2(r_0)]}\\right\\ }   dm,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the linear mass overdensity of spherical regions with lagrangian radius @xmath77 . assuming spherical collapse , we have @xmath78^{1/3}r$ ] , and @xmath76 is determined by @xmath79 and @xmath6 through the spherical collapse model ( see mw for details ) . with these",
    "the bias relation is fixed .",
    "5 shows the bias relation for haloes in a scale free model with @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that our simple model works reasonably well .      when @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the bias relation can be written as _",
    "m , z)=b(m , z)(r ) ; b(m , z)=1 + 1_z .",
    "thus the bias factor @xmath83 depends only on @xmath66 and @xmath22 . under the assumption of linear bias , _",
    "h(r)=b^2(m , z)(r ) , where @xmath13 is the two - point correlation function of mass .",
    "6 shows the two - point correlation functions for haloes in a scale free model with @xmath80 .",
    "the simple model works reasonably well .      as in  3.2",
    ", we parametrize the redshift evolution of @xmath84 by _ h(r , z)=_h(r,0)(1+z)^-(3+_h ) . unlike the mass correlation function @xmath85 ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath84 depends on how dark matter haloes are selected .",
    "we consider two different selections . in the first ,",
    "haloes are selected at the same time when the correlation function is calculated .",
    "this case is relevant for galaxies , if galaxies merge as fast as their dark haloes . in the second ,",
    "haloes are selected at an earliear epoch than when their correlation function is calculated .",
    "this case is relevant for galaxies , if they remain distinct after their haloes merge .",
    "7 shows @xmath86 as a function of @xmath22 in open cosmologies with two choices of @xmath87 . here",
    "haloes are selected according to the first selection .",
    "as before , the value of @xmath86 at @xmath22 is obtained by fitting @xmath88 in the redshift interval @xmath29 . in all cases , the halo correlation function evolves less rapidly than the mass correlation function ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , because haloes with fixed circular velocities are more biased at higher redshifts .",
    "the evolution is also less rapid for a lower @xmath87 , because of the higher degree of bias involved .",
    "8 shows the same results for haloes selected according to the second selection . in this case , the evolution of @xmath84 is faster than that of @xmath85 , because the haloes ( with @xmath89 ) are antibiased relative to the mass at the time of selection ( @xmath90 ) . for massive haloes which are ( _ positively _ ) biased relative to the mass , the evolution of their correlation function is slower than that of the mass .",
    "the evolution is also slower for a lower @xmath87 , because of the increased degree of bias ( or decreased degree of antibias ) .",
    "the results in this subsection suggest that one needs to be very cautious when interpreting the redshift evolution of galaxy correlation function . without knowing in detail what population the observed galaxies are , it is difficult to infer the time evolution of the mass correlation from the correlation functions of these galaxies .",
    "the models presented above show how the low order statistics of the density and velocity distributions are determined by cosmogonies .",
    "thus they can be used to construct statistical measures of the density and peculiar velocity fields to constrain cosmogonic models by observations . in particular",
    ", the models can help in the reconstruction of cosmogonic parameters from measurements in redshift space .",
    "there are also other applications .",
