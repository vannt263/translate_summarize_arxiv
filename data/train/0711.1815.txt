    "although radiation represents a negligible fraction of the energy in core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions , most of what we know about these events is inferred from the analysis of spectra and light curves .",
    "the gravitational binding - energy of the newly - formed protoneutron star is on the order of 10@xmath1erg . within milliseconds after",
    "core bounce , a few @xmath2 10@xmath3erg of this energy is used to photodissociate the infalling outer iron core . starting with an electron - neutrino burst when the core reaches nuclear densities , the radiation of neutrinos of all flavors operates over a few tens of seconds after the bounce as the protoneutron star cools , and carries away a few @xmath2 10@xmath3erg .",
    "these neutrinos are believed to deposit @xmath410@xmath5erg ( 1% of the total ) into the infalling progenitor mantle , reversing the accretion , and to provide the internal and kinetic energy for the sn ejecta ( woosley & janka 2005 ) . only @xmath410@xmath6erg ( 0.01% of the total ) is eventually processed into light , that gets radiated with a rate equivalent to a few @xmath2 10@xmath7 sustained for three months .",
    "depending on the progenitor radius , the shock emerges at the surface between a few hours and a day after core bounce , with a radiative precursor that is expected to heat and accelerate the surface layers , producing a soft x - ray flash ( chevalier 1982 ; ensman & burrows 1992 ; matzner & mckee 1999 ; blinnikov et al .",
    "2000 ) . cooling , due to adiabatic expansion and radiative losses , is moderated as time progresses by recombination of hydrogen during the photospheric phase of type ii sn and by non - thermal excitation by unstable isotopes .",
    "although uv emission is significant for the first few days after shock breakout , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) subsequently peaks further and further into the red , first in the visual and then in the near - ir , a few months after explosion ( kirshner et al .",

    "core - collapse sn explosions constitute an excellent laboratory for inferring the properties of massive stars at the end of their lives and , indirectly , their pre - sn evolution . as the material expands , the photosphere recedes to deeper and deeper layers of the star s former envelope , allowing the observer to probe all the way from the surface at shock breakout to the innermost layers just outside the compact remnant .",
    "the nebular phase , the epoch when the ejecta become optically thin throughout ( @xmath43 - 4 months after explosion for type ii sne ) , permits the inspection of the regions where the blast originated , offering a means to constrain the mechanism and the morphology of the explosion as well as the nucleosynthetic yields .",
    "detailed quantitative analyzes focus on the early , photospheric , evolution ( hoflich 1988 ; eastman & kirshner 1989 ; schmutz et al .",
    "1990 ; baron et al 1996 , 2000 , 2003 , 2004 , 2007 ; mitchell et al .",
    "2002 ; dessart & hillier 2005a,2006ab ) , because the ejecta are best suited for `` standard '' model atmosphere computations : there is an optically - thick base where the radiation thermalizes ; there is no contribution from non - thermal excitation by isotopes like @xmath8ni and its daughter product @xmath8co ; electron scattering dominates the opacity ; and line and continuum formation is spatially confined .",
    "advances in computer technology permit better handling of non - local - thermodynamic - equilibrium ( non - lte ) effects and the critical role played by metals is now systematically accounted for ( baron et al .",
    "2004 ; dessart & hillier 2005a ) .",
    "non - lte effects are important even at early times , for example , to reproduce the hei lines observed in optical spectra . here",
    ", we present a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the early photospheric - phase evolution of the type ii sne 2005cs in ngc 5194 and sn 2006bp in ngc 3953 , both with plateau - type light curves as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_obs ] .",
    "we employ the non - lte model atmosphere code cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ; dessart & hillier 2005a ) , in its steady - state configuration , following a similar approach to dessart & hillier ( 2006a ; hereafter dh06 ) and their analysis of sn 1999em .",
    "a novel component of our study is the use of _ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) ultra - violet / optical telescope ( uvot ; roming et al . 2005 ) ultraviolet photometry that places important constraints on the sed in the uv , the early cooling of the photosphere , and the reddening .",
    "we infer from our models that sn 2005cs and sn 2006bp , were discovered only @xmath42 days after explosion , the earliest detections after explosion since sn 1987a ( type ii peculiar ) and sn 1993j ( type iib ; see , e.g. , matheson et al .",
    "2000 ) . as a result of this prompt discovery",
    ", we have the opportunity to observe a bright uv spectrum and to see high - excitation lines that have not previously been observed in sn ii - p .",
    "finally , the fine time sampling of our spectra during the first month , along with dense photometric monitoring allows us to make an accurate distance determination .",
    "this is a good demonstration of the potential of type ii - p sne , when coupled with detailed models , to provide accurate extragalactic distances . unlike the standard approach that depend on the cepheid period - luminosity relation in the lmc and other nearby galaxies ,",
    "our method is based on physical models fitted directly to observations , and the distances it provides are independent of all the lower rungs of the distance ladder .",
    "we aim to assess the accuracy of distance determinations based on type ii - p sne , and to refine the value of the hubble constant @xmath9 , in the spirit of the earlier efforts of schmidt et al .",
    "measurements of the total matter and baryonic content of the universe via cmb experiments or large - scale structure correlations depend on the square of @xmath9 ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ; eisenstein et al . 2005 ) . in concordance solutions ,",
    "these uncertainties affect measurements of the dark energy density and its associated equation - of - state parameter @xmath10 ( garnavich et al .",

    "2006 for an illustration of the effect an improved accuracy on @xmath9 has on @xmath10 ) .",
    "a small improvement in our knowledge of @xmath9 will lead to a significant improvement in the understanding the energy content of the universe .",

    "the value of @xmath30 is usually quite large , i.e. , @xmath410 , but could be much larger at early times , and can be constrained from line profile shapes , through the magnitude of the blueshift of peak emission of optical p - cygni profiles ( dessart & hillier 2005a ; blondin et al . 2006 ; aldering et al .",

    "the early - time spectra of sne 2005cs and 2006bp , show weak p - cygni profiles with a strongly blueshifted peak emission , and point towards high values of n. we quote properties of models at the photosphere , which corresponds to the location where the continuum optical depth , integrated inwards from the outer grid radius , is 2/3 .",
    "the luminosity at depth is not known in advance unless one uses a consistent hydrodynamical input of the ejecta properties , following simultaneously the time - dependent evolution of the radiation field , internal energy , and level populations .",

    "usually , with our inferred distance and reddening , the emergent reddened synthetic flux is within a factor of 3 of the observed flux .",

    "the first approach is to apply the expanding photosphere method ( epm ; kirshner & kwan 1974 ; eastman & kirshner 1989 ; schmidt et al .",
    "1994 ; eastman et al . 1996 ; hamuy et al . 2001 ; leonard et al .",
    "2002a ; elmhamdi et al .",
    "2003 ) , but using correction factors and color temperatures calculated directly from our tailored models at each epoch ( as in dh06 ) .",
    "this approach is superior to using analytical formulae describing the dependence of correction factors on color temperature , since those are computed for models that may not match the observed spectrum .",
    "this approach avoids the physical scatter that stems from such a diversity among sn ii .",
    "the second approach is to use our synthetic spectra to directly fit observations , as described in dh06 , in a similar fashion to the seam ( baron et al .",
    "2004 ) . for both ,",
    "the observed magnitudes shown in table  [ tab_phot_05cs ] and [ tab_phot_06bp ] are used , either directly or interpolated linearly between adjacent dates to correspond to the date of the spectroscopic observation .",
    "this does not introduce any sizable error given the very slow change ( nearly constant from day to day within the errors ) of @xmath114 , @xmath109 , and @xmath115 magnitudes in the early photospheric phase of type ii - p sne .",
    "we have described at length the epm in dessart & hillier ( 2005b ) , complementing the previous work of eastman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , providing some insights into the method and its limitations , as well as a new and independently determined set of correction factors based on a large database of cmfgen models .",
    "correction factors determined with cmfgen are comparable to , albeit systematically 10 - 20% larger than , those of eastman et al . ,",
    "although the origin of this small , but important , difference remains unclear . in dh06 ,",
    "we applied the epm to sn 1999em and found that , unless the correction factors and associated color temperatures are determined with tailored models , the epm distance and the explosion time were inconsistent when different bandpass - sets were used ( amongst @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 ) . since the photospheric radius is nearly constant across the optical range ( dessart & hillier 2005b ) the inferred distance ought to be the same whatever optical set is used .",
    "another source of uncertainty , although smaller , is the inference of the photospheric velocity , @xmath52 , usually approximated by adopting the doppler velocity at maximum absorption in weak and seemingly isolated p - cygni profiles ( note that sphericity and projection effects , subtleties in the line transfer problem , and diversity in atomic properties lead to a non - trivial relation between the photospheric velocity and the velocity at maximum absorption in a given line ; see dessart & hillier 2005b for a discussion on this issue ) . in our approach",
    ", we adopt the value from our cmfgen model .",
    "although our model fits are satisfactory , they sometimes overestimate or underestimate profile widths , matching some profiles very well while doing a poorer job on others at the same time .",
    "there is likely a genuine range of velocities at the photosphere due to fluid instabilities and density variations , so that a 10% inaccuracy in the photospheric velocity at a given time may in fact exist .",
    "however , we expect the sense and the magnitude of the uncertainty in our inferences to behave randomly",
    ". we do not consistently overestimate or underestimate v@xmath119 , or the flux in a given spectral region , so that observations at many times should reduce the uncertainty .",
    "reddening is another ingredient requiring special care in distance estimates . in our approach",
    ", we use synthetic seds to constrain the reddening @xmath35 within @xmath120 .",
    "the dust properties in other galaxies may not be well reproduced by the cardelli law , which we employ , and this introduces an additional uncertainty , which is significant for the strongly extinguished sn 2006bp ( for such a discussion , see , e.g. , elias - rosa et al .",
    "2006 ) .    for both objects",
    ", we have a good constraint on the explosion time from prior optical detection / non - detection .",
    "however , compact progenitor stars like blue supergiants brighten in the optical much more quickly than rsg stars with their extended envelopes , whose sed may peak in the uv a few days after explosion ( the difference comes from the energy penalty associated with the ejecta expansion ) . hence , optical non - detection / detection may not constrain the explosion date to better than one day . searching for",

    "overall , the agreement between the epm and the seam - like distances to sn 2005cs give us confidence that our inference is accurate ( further confidence on such an accuracy could come from a cepheid distance to m 51 , in analogy to the case of sn 1999em and ngc 1637 ; see leonard et al .",

    "leads to uncertainties of 0.5mpc and 0.5day for the distance and explosion date determined through the epm .",

    "helium is singly ionized throughout the sn 1999em ejecta , but twice ionized in the inner and outer regions of the sn 2006bp ejecta .",
    "this trend towards much higher ionization at earlier times supports the identification of heii4686  emission in the sn 2006bp ejecta , as well as oii lines for both sn 2006bp ( at about 5 days after explosion ) and sn 2005cs ( in the discovery spectrum ) .",
    "oii lines were not detected unambiguously in the first spectrum taken of sn 1999em because it was taken too late , about 12 days later than sn 2005cs relative to the explosion time .",
    "moreover , at such early times , adopting the nitrogen abundance of dh06 now overestimates the strength of nii lines and underestimates the strength of oii lines , justifying the adoption in this work of cno abundances closer to solar , i.e. c / he=0.0004 , n / he=0.0013 , o / he = 0.0016 , in agreement with the surface chemistry of blue supergiants analyzed by crowther et al . (",
    "2006 ) . by comparison , dh06 used c / he=0.00017 , n / he=0.0068 , o / he = 0.0001 ( all given by number ; for both works we use h / he=5 ) . we thus concur with the findings of baron et al .",
    "( 2007 ) on the necessary cno chemistry to reproduce the observations of oii and nii lines in the early spectra of sn 2005cs ( as well as in sn 2006bp ) , with a depletion of carbon and oxygen compared to solar that is modest rather than severe . in general , an accurate determination of cno abundances in the fast - expanding photospheres of type ii - p sne is difficult since the corresponding lines are weak and overlap with lines of other species such as hei .",
    "having recourse to quantitative spectroscopy of the emergent light from their supergiant progenitors , which can be found in number and nearby , seems a more viable route to constraining the surface chemistry of such pre - sn massive stars .    in both objects , the near featureless spectral appearance over the first few days requires the choice of a very high power - law density exponent of 2050 to dwarf the emission volume of all optical lines , as well as very high ejecta velocities to reproduce the large widths of emission line features .",
    "this is admittedly well above the value @xmath73 for the propagation of a shock wave through the envelope of a massive star progenitor , both obtained theoretically ( imshennik & nadezhin 1988 ; shigeyama & nomoto 1990 , chevalier 1982 ; ensman & burrows 1992 , blinnikov et al .",
    "2000 ) and inferred observationally ( see , e.g. , eastman & kirshner 1989 ; schmutz et al . 1990 ; baron et al .",
    "2000 ; dessart & hillier 2005a,2006a ) .",
    "nonetheless , for the outermost layers of the progenitor envelope , a much steeper density profile is expected , with values in the vicinity of a few tens ( blinnikov et al .",
    "2000 , and in particular their fig .  1 ) , and , under certain conditions , a small amount of mass at the progenitor surface may even reach relativistic speeds as the shock breaks out ( matzner & mckee 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the radiation - hydrodynamics codes used to compute the ejecta structures of core - collapse sn are lagrangean , and are thus not well designed to describe the dynamics and the structure of the low density surface layers . in those fully - ionized regions , the luminosity is super - eddington by up to a few orders of magnitude , even when accounting only for the electron - scattering opacity .",
    "when accounting for the additional contribution of optically thick and thin lines , we find that the radiation pressure can be very substantial , following the combination of a huge luminosity , a low density , and a large velocity gradient ( castor , abbott , & klein 1975 ) . in the cmfgen model of sn 2006bp on 30 june 2006 , the radiative acceleration in the layers above the photosphere reaches a few thousand cms@xmath131 , which combined with a velocity of a few 10000and a length scale of 10@xmath132 cm lead to a velocity gain of few tens of percent ( assuming the acceleration remains constant ) .",
    "sooner after shock breakout , the radiative acceleration could be even larger .",
    "overall , we expect that the outer optically - thin layers would adopt a steeper density distribution and a faster - than - linear velocity distribution with radius .",
    "we plan to investigate these issues more quantitatively in the future , but at present , it seems that the earliest observations of sne 2005cs and 2006bp support the very steep density distribution obtained in radiation - hydrodynamics simulations of core - collapse sn ejecta soon after shock breakout .    before closing this section",
    ", we note that sn 1999gi is another type ii - p sn discovered very early , perhaps only @xmath44@xmath133 days after explosion ( leonard et al .",
    "interestingly , leonard et al .",
    "report the presence of a full p - cygni profile shifted from the rest wavelength of h@xmath39 by @xmath134 in the first spectrum of sn 1999gi , and speculate on the potential association with ejecta inhomogeneities . in the context of a density inhomogeneity far above the photosphere",
    ", a blueshifted absorption is a possibility , but a p - cygni profile entirely blueshifted , and by that amount , is not ( see , however , dessart & hillier 2005a ) .",
    "we reproduce their observation in fig .",
    "[ fig_he2 ] , and overplot the first spectrum of sn 2006bp ( red line ) .",
    "given the close correspondence between the two spectra and the likely early detection of sn 1999gi , we propose that , in fact , the broad line feature just blueward of h@xmath39 in the spectrum of sn 1999gi is due to heii4686 , as for sn 2006bp .",
    "having inferred the reddening and the distance to sne 2005cs and 2006bp , we can deduce the absolute magnitude for each event at all epochs studied .",
    "together with results presented for sn 1999em in dh06 , we show in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_mag_vphot ] the evolution with time since explosion of the absolute magnitude in @xmath114 ( black ) , @xmath109 ( blue ) , and @xmath115 ( red ) , for sn 2005cs ( solid line ) , sn 2006bp ( dashed line ; @xmath135 is shown instead of @xmath115 ) , and sn 1999em ( dotted line ) .",
    "note that the time of explosion is computed together with the distance , rather than estimated based on prior non - detection of the sn on pre - explosion images of the corresponding host - galaxy .",
    "while the spectroscopic and photometric evolution of three events are comparable in all spectral regions at a given time after explosion , they display a sizable range of intrinsic brightness .",
    "sn 2005cs is about two magnitudes fainter than sn 2006bp , about a factor of six in ( bolometric ) luminosity , with sn 1999em somewhat less luminous than sn 2006bp .",
    "sn 2006bp was detected earliest of all three and is in fact the first type ii - p to be caught so soon after explosion , with a @xmath42-day delay at most ( note that 1987a and 1993j are not type ii - p sne ) .    in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_mag_vphot ] , we show the corresponding evolution of the model photospheric velocity , for sne 2005cs , 1999em , and 2006bp . the above trend is maintained , i.e. , larger intrinsic brightness is associated with larger ejecta velocity .",
    "note that if the bolometric luminosity scaled with the square of the ejecta velocity , a brightening by 1.5mag would result from a factor of 2 enhancement in velocity , which is compatible with our inferences for sne 2005cs and 2006bp ( top row of fig .",
    "[ fig_mag_vphot ] ) .",
    "since we adopt similar ejecta structures ( after one week past explosion ) , this suggests that the bolometric luminosity correlates with the ejecta kinetic energy in the hydrogen shell , as pointed out in the past by , for example , falk & arnett ( 1977 ) , litvinova & nadezhin ( 1983 ) , hamuy ( 2003 ) , zampieri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , pastorello et al .",
    "the late time brightness is not controlled by the energy deposited at shock passage , but rather stems from the amount and location of the unstable nickel at the start of homologous expansion , so the above trend may not carry over until much later times , although it might , but for different reasons ( higher energy explosions may systematically produce more @xmath8ni ) .    similarly , and for completeness",
    ", we include in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_mag_vphot ] the temporal evolution of the photospheric radius ( left ) and temperature ( right ) .",
    "note the smaller extent of the slowly - expanding ejecta of sn2005cs , the converging photospheric temperatures , and the near - constant photospheric radii at the recombination epoch for all three sne , tightly linked to the plateau appearance of the visual light - curves at such times .",
    "our modeling approach has been first to fit the optical range , using both the overall shape of the sed and spectral lines formed in the sn ejecta . as a consistency check , as well as an additional constraint on the resulting model parameters and the choice of reddening",
    ", we compared the synthetic spectrum to the observed _ swift _ uvot values . for both sn 2005cs and sn 2006bp",
    ", we obtain very satisfactory fits and we thus conclude that the observed uv and optical light emerges from the photospheric layers of the sn ejecta , over the first 1 - 2 months after explosion ( starting 3 - 5 days afterwards ) .",
    "this result is unambiguous , and , thus , no sizable contribution to the uv and optical fluxes stems from an interaction with the csm .",
    "a further evidence for the photospheric origin of the uv flux is the identification of the mgii2800line as a broad p - cygni profile in _ swift _ uvot grism spectra ( brown et al .",
    "2007 ) , with a width compatible with the photospheric velocity at the corresponding epoch .",
    "so , while circumstellar interaction may be important in some type ii sne ( the iin events ) , it seems to contribute negligibly to the uv and optical light we received from sn 2005cs and sn 2006bp , and more generally in agreement with the weak radio and x - ray emission from type ii - p sne ( see , e.g. , pooley et al .",
    "2002 ; chevalier et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the recent spectroscopic analysis by baron et al . ( 2007 ) of sn 2005cs at two epochs in the photospheric phase agrees in many respects with the findings of the present study for that object and , thus , gives some credence to the type ii sn spectroscopic analyzes performed with phoenix ( hauschildt & baron 1999 ) and cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ; dessart & hillier 2005a ) .",
    "this is particularly satisfying since phoenix and cmfgen are two very distinct codes , and use different assumptions in the modeling .",
    "a potential important difference in assumptions is our neglect of energy contribution from radioactive decay throughout this work .",
    "by contrast with baron et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we find no strong evidence for nickel mixing and non - thermal energy deposition at the photosphere over the first month after explosion ( in this work , we obtain good fits to observations prior to the hydrogen - recombination epoch without invoking this additional source of energy ) .",
    "the ejecta ionization structure computed by the two codes may thus differ .    in this work ,",
    "we infer a reddening @xmath36 , in agreement with baron et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who obtain a value of 0.035 .",

    "the identification of oii and nii lines can explain most , if not all , the mysterious kinks seen in the blue wing of h@xmath39 or hei5875  ( see , e.g. , leonard et al .",
    "2002a , b who reported such kinks in the spectra of sne 1999em and 1999gi ) . here ,",

    "again , observations support the same ejecta chemistry at the photosphere at corresponding epochs after explosion for both sne .",

    "baron et al . ( 2007 ) find at the photosphere a temperature of 6000k , a velocity of 4000kms@xmath88 and a density exponent of 8 . in the same order and for that date",

    "require a photospheric velocity nearly three times as large to do so , and also larger than the value on day 17 ( in fact nearly as large as on the first spectrum taken , for which we use 6880kms@xmath88 ) .",
    "upon inspection of their figs .",
    "12 - 13 , it appears that h@xmath38 peaks at @xmath46480 , while the observations they use , as originally published in p06 , and our ( restframe ) cfa observations show a peak at 6550 .",
    "this difference of 70  corresponds to a velocity shift of 3200kms@xmath88 at this wavelength and suggests that their extravagant proposition of an outward moving photosphere between day 17 and day 34 ( see their  6 ) may stem solely from a problem with the wavelength of their flux datapoints .",

    "although the observed spectra of sne 2005cs and 2006bp presented in this work are different in many ways , these reflect mostly the difference in the ejecta expansion rate ( small for 2005cs ) , the reddening in the line of sight ( large for 2006bp ) , and the elapsed time between explosion and discovery ( very short for 2006bp ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mag_vphot ] , both sne evolve in a similar fashion , 2005cs being merely underluminous and boasting a lower ejecta kinetic energy .",
    "we have presented a multi - epoch multi - wavelength quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the two type ii - p sn events 2005cs and 2006bp , over the first two months after explosion , and have reached similar conclusions on the ejecta properties to those for sn 1999em ( dh06 ) .",
    "the progenitor stars have a composition compatible with a bsg / rsg progenitor .",
    "the spectral evolution shows a reddening of the sed with time , with a flux peaking in the uv at very early times , but progressively shifting to longer wavelengths . the photosphere recedes to deeper layers with time , reaching mass shells moving at about 2000 - 3000about 6 weeks after explosion and having enhanced",
    "carbon and oxygen , and reduced nitrogen , abundances , compared to the surface layers .",
    "we find a density distribution that is very steep at early times , and we surmise that this could be an imprint of the shock breakout epoch . from about a week until six weeks after explosion , we find a more standard and constant density exponent of ten for the corresponding power law distribution , compared to a value of 50 ( for sn 2006bp ) and 20 ( for sn 2005cs ) used to model the first observation .",
    "_ swift _ uvot photometry and ground - based optical spectroscopy and photometry support a common origin for the uv and the optical light , so that we anticipate that if csm interaction does occur , it does not contribute significantly to the observed uv and optical fluxes .    using our analysis , we infer the distance and the explosion date of each sn .",
    "we find , in that order , jd 2453547.6@xmath00.5 days ( 2.8 days prior to discovery ) and 8.9@xmath00.5mpc for sn 2005cs , and jd 2453833.4@xmath00.4days ( 1.7 days prior to discovery ) and 17.5@xmath00.8mpc for sn 2006bp .",
    "the large number of observations , the quality of our fits , the agreement between the two methods followed suggests a very high level of internal consistency of the distances determined here with type ii sne . the actual level of accuracy on such determined distances , which we estimate to be on the order of 10% ( related to the spectral fitting accuracy )",
    ", would be best assessed by confrontation with alternate methods ( cepheids for example , although all alternate methods have their own inaccuracies , claimed and otherwise ) , the determination of distances to a galaxy host with well - recorded multiple type ii sn events ( the typical type ii sn rate of 2 per century per galaxy makes this proposition somewhat unrealistic ) , a galactic sn that could also be resolved with an interferometer or a large - aperture telescope .",
    "our perspective on the uncertainty of our distance measurements is that , were we to increase the number of type ii sne suitable for analysis in m 51 to 10 or 100 , the scatter in the distance determined with our technique for that sample would not be larger than 10% .",
    "but this would still be no proof that the resulting average distance is indeed the right one since enlarging the sample would only allow for an internal consistency check on our method . in the short term , a cepheid distance to the galaxy host of 2005cs and 2006bp is highly desirable , and would provide an independent check on the distance computed with type ii - p sne , as was done with success in the past with sn 1999em ( leonard et al . 2003 ; baron et al . 2004 ; dh06 ) , giving further support to the potential use of such objects for distance determinations in the universe .",
    "this work fits within an ambitious project to build a general understanding of sn ejecta , to infer properties of the progenitor star ( with ramifications for massive star evolution ) and the explosion mechanisms at the origin of the event .",
    "a major ongoing theoretical development is the treatment of time - dependent effects both in the radiation field and in the level populations to allow for a direct modeling of the evolution over months after shock breakout , through the photospheric and into the nebular phases , and based on a range of hydrodynamical models of the explosion . in parallel ,",
