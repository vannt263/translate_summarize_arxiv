    "the iron - based superconductors form a large family of materials which exhibits considerable diversity in their lattice structures .",
    "examples include the 1111 , 111 , and 122 iron pnictides , as well as the 11 iron chalcogenides .",
    "the structural unit cell of most of these superconductors consists of two fe and two pnictogen / chalcogen atoms and it is typically labeled as a 2-fe unit cell . in momentum space , the corresponding physical brillouin zone ( bz ) is usually referred to as the folded bz ( fbz ) .",
    "however , many theoretical studies have been based on tight - binding models defined on an effective `` unfolded bz '' ( ubz ) of 1-fe unit cell with an implicit equivalence between the former and the fbz .",
    "the mapping between the effective 1-fe ubz and the physical 2-fe fbz is via a bz folding procedure . in view of the widespread use of this mapping",
    "we believe it is important to better understand the necessary conditions for its employment .",
    "an early discussion of such a bz folding procedure for 1111 iron - pnictide superconductors was provided by lee and wen @xcite . they noticed that a single fe - as plane contains a glide reflection symmetry which consists of a fractional unit cell translation followed by a reflection about the fe - plane ( see below ) . this symmetry can be used to define a pseudo - crystal momentum which can label the single - particle wave - functions with different parities under the operation .",
    "the last step in turn allows the definition on an unfolding procedure from the 2-fe fbz of the physical momentum space to the 1-fe ubz of the pseudo - crystal momentum space .",
    "more recently , a thorough group theoretical description of the electronic structure in the iron - based superconductors with a @xmath0 space group symmetry has been given in ref .  .",
    "there , it was found that the glide - reflection symmetry classifies the bloch states near the fermi level and puts strong constraints on the low - energy effective model of the system .",
    "the immediate motivation for the current work has come from the strong - coupling approach to superconductivity in the multi - orbital models for the iron - based materials .",
    "superconducting paring in this approach has been studied by using @xmath2 models with three or more @xmath3 orbitals , involving at least the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 set , in an effective 1-fe unit cell @xcite ; such studies have been motivated by both the multi - orbital nature of the electronic structure and the bad - metal behavior of the parent compounds @xcite . as we will discuss , the bloch states formed directly from @xmath4 and @xmath5 wannier states are odd under the reflection about the fe plane , whereas those associated with the @xmath6 orbital are even under this symmetry operation . in the former case ,",
    "the unfolding procedure becomes trivial as both types of bloch states map onto the same quasi - crystal momentum in an unfolded bz .",
    "by contrast , states derived directly from the @xmath6 orbital are mapped onto a quasi - crystal momentum which is shifted w.r.t .",
    "the other two orbital states . given this ,",
    "the validity of calculations done directly in a 1-fe unit cell comes into question and a careful examination is required to establish whether a more involved 2-fe unit cell basis should be used instead .",
    "it appears that this potential issue is not restricted to the particular @xmath1 case .",
    "indeed , within a more general but related context , different ways of taking into account the two inequivalent pnictogen / chalcogen atoms have recently been proposed  @xcite .",
    "a consensus does not appear to be reached since even the lattice symmetries considered in these studies are quite different : ref .",
    "considered a @xmath7 point - group symmetry about each as atom , while in ref .",
    "a local @xmath8 symmetry about each fe atom was taken into account .",
    "the proposed effective tight - binding models and the superconducting pairing symmetries in these two works are also quite distinct . indeed , while ref .",
    "proposed a spin singlet , orbital triplet @xmath9 @xmath10 pairing ( denoted as  tao pairing \" ) as a consequence of the two inequivalent as atoms , refs .",
    "discussed an @xmath11-wave odd - parity pairing with nonzero total momentum , labeled @xmath12-pairing .",
    "these proposals not only question the validity of using the an effective 1-fe ubz , they also point to the need for a clear link between the superconducting pairing and lattice ( space group ) symmetries .",
    "this is particularly the case for the @xmath12-pairing , where it is still uncertain whether such pairing is allowed by the space group symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we believe that part of the confusion regarding the pairing symmetry is related to the issue we mentioned in the beginning of our paper : to what extent can a model for iron - based superconductors defined on the 1-fe ubz reproduce results consistent with the one defined on a 2-fe fbz ? here",
    "we study this problem for systems with a @xmath0 space group ( which include the 111 and 1111 iron pnictides and the 11 iron chalcogenides ) .",
    "the stringent conditions imposed by the space group constitute our starting points in the analysis of the validity of the 1-fe unit cell formulation . to our knowledge",
    "there have been only a few attempts @xcite at placing this procedure on a firmer footing .",
    "more specifically , we wish to give a better description of the notion of the glide reflection symmetry within a more formal group - theoretical context and provide some justification for it s implicit use as a general symmetry which can be used to label bloch states of arbitrary momenta .",
    "the glide reflection operation is a part of the @xmath0 space group , and is characteristic of the non - symmorphic nature of this group . as we will see",
    ", it plays an important role in establishing , in the absence of any spin - orbit coupling , the validity of using the 1-fe ubz for both the single - particle dispersion and the pairing states . from analyzing the effect of the glide reflection ,",
    "we are also able to show that treating the local spin - orbit coupling would require working with the 2-fe fbz",
    ". we should stress that we will consider the effect of the glide reflection in the context of the entire space group symmetry .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "subsection : folding_wo_soc ] , we aim to give a rigorous analysis of the mapping from the physical 2-fe bz to an effective 1-fe bz for a class of materials with @xmath0 space group symmetry .",
    "our considerations apply to the ideally 2d case for which the conduction electrons do not disperse along the c - axis .",
    "we show that in this case , the existence of a glide reflection symmetry for all momenta is _ guaranteed _ by this particular space group . without a spin - orbit coupling , the classification of all bloch states under the glide reflection and the particular degeneracies along the bz ensure that the folding procedure does not violate any space group symmetries of the system . in section",
    "[ sec : effects_pairing ] we discuss some consequences of the space group symmetry on the superconducting pairing in the multi - orbital @xmath1 model . in section",
    "[ sec : soc ] , we discuss the effects of an atomic spin - orbit coupling term on the electronic properties of both normal and superconducting states . we first show in section  [ sec : space_group_with_soc ] that despite the glide reflection still being a valid symmetry for all momenta , the lack of degeneracies along part of the bz edge nullifies the usual unfolding procedure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : soc_numerics ] we present and compare numerical results for the normal state bandstructure with and without a spin - orbit coupling to confirm the preceding symmetry - based arguments .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we show how the symmetry arguments on the bz folding survive for a 2d dispersion even when the interlayer couplings are taken into account .",
    "we also discuss the constraint imposed by the space group symmetry on the glide - reflection parity of the pairing channels , and subsequently examine the compatibility of several proposed pairings with the previously described space group symmetry .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] . appendix [ sec : appendix_a ] contains a derivation of the important ansatz used in the main sections while related details are given in appendix [ sec : appendix_b ] .",
    "in a large group of fe - based materials which have the @xmath0 space group symmetry , the identical fe - pnictogen / chalcogen layers are stacked on top of each other along the c - axis .",
    "the nontrivial spatial symmetry properties can be traced back to the structure of a single layer which is composed of a square fe lattice in between two square as lattices shifted horizontally w.r.t . the fe lattice and each other .",
    "the projection of the layer onto the fe plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure_bz ] ( a ) .",
    "two adjacent fe sites have different nearest - neighbor as configurations defining the @xmath13 and @xmath14 sublattices .",
    "the space group of the 1111 fe - based superconductors is @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is non - symmorphic such that under any choice of unit cell one can not decompose the set of symmetry operations into a point subgroup and its coset made up of proper lattice translations . in particular , for the conventional 2-fe unit cell choice @xcite , the crystal is invariant under a glide reflection symmetry @xmath15 composed of a fractional unit cell translation @xmath16 in units of the sublattice translation , followed by a reflection about the fe - plane @xmath17 .",
    "the notation was chosen to be consistent with ref .  .",
    "the crucial point to consider is that the glide reflection @xmath18 can be used to classify bloch states of arbitrary momentum @xmath19 . as observed in ref .  , for a general @xmath20 in the folded brillouin zone ( fbz ) corresponding to the 2-fe unit cell , the group of the wave - vector is isomorphic to the @xmath21 point group .",
    "the latter has two irreducible representations which have even / odd parity under the simple reflection @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , states belonging to the irreducible representations of the space group @xmath0 for general @xmath23 are also either even ( e ) or odd ( o ) under the glide reflection . in our view , this provides a connection between the particular glide reflection symmetry as part of the space group of the hamiltonian and it s use in classifying states of arbitrary 2d momentum @xmath19 , an argument we feel lacks an explicit exposition in the literature . by general group theoretical arguments",
    "@xcite , states belonging to different irreducible representations can not mix and thus the even / odd bloch states do not hybridize . as we show in the following , this , together with the particular degeneracies along the entire folded bz edge",

    "the fbz is defined by the translation in reciprocal space by @xmath24 or @xmath25 , which correspond to @xmath26 or @xmath27 in the notation for the effective 1-fe unit cell .",

    "the advantage of using an unfolded 1-fe bz consists in effectively reducing the number of bands in the calculation . in practice",
    "this means introducing a set of trial wavefunctions defined on an ubz , carrying on the calculation , then folding back to the physical fbz . in doing this",
    ", one must check that the bloch functions defined in the ubz do not introduce additional hybridization terms in the hamiltonian , and that they do not violate any of the original symmetries of the space group . here , we analyze the same procedure in reverse .",
    "we start with a set of trial wave functions which are in accord with a minimum space group symmetry , namely the glide reflection , then examine the unfolding process .    as mentioned in the previous section , the glide - reflection can be used to classify the irreducible representations of the space group for general @xmath19 in the folded bz when there is no dispersion along the @xmath34-axis i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "this ensures that eigenstates of this operator will be eigenstates of the hamiltonian within a transformation on the orbital indices alone . as a consequence",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written in block diagonal form at these general @xmath19 .",
    "the detailed representation theory of this space group shows that for a number of higher - symmetry momenta in the fbz , the irreducible representations are not required to be eigenstates of the glide @xcite .",
    "this does not invalidate our arguments since by continuity any off - diagonal terms must vanish here as well . we will show that this implies a one - to - one correspondence between the eigenstates of the glide - reflection and bloch states defined on the ubz , with no hybridization between different momenta .",
    "we proceed to build bloch eigenstates of the glide operation with @xmath19 in the folded zone ( see appendix [ sec : appendix_a ] ) .",
    "the electron annihilation operator in the physical 2-fe bz on sublattice a(b ) is defined as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is an orbital index , @xmath38 refers to the number of ( 2-fe ) unit cells and @xmath39 is the index of the unit cell .",

    "we also refer the reader to appendix [ sec : appendix_a ] for more details on the states defined above .    since @xmath48 and @xmath49 have different parity under the glide for arbitrary `` 2-fe '' crystal momentum , they do not mix in a one - particle hamiltonian .",
    "an arbitrary 2d tight - binding hamiltonian consistent with the space group symmetries can then be expressed in the terms of the @xmath50 states as    @xmath51    where @xmath52 stands for the 2-fe folded brillouin zone and @xmath53 are matrices in orbital space .",
    "we omitted the spin index for simplicity .",
    "we now turn to the unfolding procedure and start by noting that the eigenstates of the glide reflection have ( see eqs .",

    "to @xmath19 one can also label all the states according to the irreducible representations of the glide reflection as well , that is , by both @xmath19 and @xmath57 .",
    "the resolution to our apparent conundrum lies in the fact that states displaced by a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath58 can switch their representation with respect to the glide reflections : @xmath59 this ensures that we are not violating the original pure translation symmetry but it also introduces a constraint : eigenstates of the system must be at least doubly degenerate all along the edge of the first ( folded ) bz . only in such case",
    "can the states switch representations as one goes beyond the folded bz .",
    "indeed , this is precisely what happens in si and ge at the x point along the edge of the bz @xcite , @xcite .",

    "we stress that both unfolding procedures discussed above were guaranteed by the absence of mixing between the @xmath83 sectors in the hamiltonian for general @xmath19 together with the switching of the glide parity for the ansatz states beyond the first folded bz ( eq .

    "[ sec : bz_folding ] , we believe that it is insufficient to argue that the presence of a glide reflection operation in the space group of the hamiltonian guarantees the success of a folding procedure . along with the glide reflection , the space group contains fifteen other symmetry elements @xcite different from pure sublattice translations . of these",

    "we assume that the symmetry outlined in the previous sections is not violated such that without the pairing interactions one can unfold the bz of the 2-fe unit cell to the effective 1-fe ubz .",

    "[ subsection : folding_wo_soc ] , some additional remarks are in order . the tight - binding part of a hamiltonian with pairing interactions at mean - field level is typically chosen as the identity representation of the space group . in general , the pairing functions are determined self - consistently and can lower the symmetry of the hamiltonian to a subgroup of the full space group ( as _ e.g. _ , what happens to the rotational invariance of the hamiltonian under the @xmath86 operation of the @xmath87 point group of the full @xmath0 space group in the case of a d - wave pairing ) .",
    "the problem simplifies for the spin singlet pairing considered in this section . for cooper pairs of equal and opposite momenta in the fbz ( @xmath88 ) associated with the 2-fe unit cell , the symmetry properties of the pairing functions",

    "in addition , for zero total momentum representations , the glide reflection is equivalent to a simple reflection about the z - plane .",
    "this means that the parity under inversion coincides with the parity under the glide - reflection for one dimensional irreducible tensor representations and is opposite for the two - dimensional ones  @xcite .",
    "restricting ourselves to the former 1d representations , a hamiltonian containing any linear combination of inversion - even pairing terms can not break the glide reflection symmetry , regardless of whether the pairing preserves the rotational invariance or not .",
    "the glide symmetry can be broken if and only if the system spontaneously breaks the inversion symmetry , which consequently results in triplet pairing .",
    "the remaining part of the section seeks to illustrate that no finite momentum pairing terms can be present in either the folded or unfolded bz provided that the hamiltonian is invariant under the glide - reflection .",
