    "although the first example of a wavelet basis dates back to 1910  @xcite , it was not until the early 1980 s , with the work of goupillaud , morlet and grossmann  @xcite in seismic geophysics , that the wavelet transform ( wt ) became a popular tool for the analysis of signals with non - periodic characteristics , termed _ non - stationary _ signals  @xcite .",
    "the wt allows a signal to be examined in both the time- and frequency - domains simultaneously .",
    "the wt as a time - frequency method has replaced the conventional fourier transform ( ft ) in many practical applications . the wt has been successfully applied in many areas of physics  @xcite including astrophysics , seismic geophysics , turbulence and quantum mechanics , as well as many other fields including image processing , biological signal analysis , genomic dna analysis , speech recognition , computer graphics and multifractal analysis .",
    "the term wt is conventionally used to refer to a broad selection of transformation methods and algorithms . in all cases ,",
    "the essence of a wt is to expand the input function in terms of oscillations which are localized in both time and frequency .",
    "different applications of the wt have different requirements .",
    "image compression , for example , often uses the discrete wt ( dwt ) to transform data to a new , orthogonal basis set where the data are hopefully presented in a more redundant form  @xcite .",
    "other applications , particularly signal analysis  @xcite , use the cwt , sacrificing orthogonality for extra precision in the identification of features in a signal .",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to present the wt in a form well suited to the analysis of one - dimensional signals whose frequency components have rapidly varying frequency and amplitude modulations . in order to achieve this aim",
    ", we introduce a new ` tunable ' , complex wavelet .",
    "this wavelet is based upon the well - known morlet wavelet  @xcite but is better suited to high - resolution analysis .",
    "the features of the wt using the proposed wavelet are understood through an asymptotic stationary - phase approximation to the integral expression of the wt specialized to the new wavelet .",
    "we demonstrate the properties of the wt using two example functions , a mathematical function and the other a realistic physical model function .",
    "we are interested in exploiting the complex wt in the analysis of structural correlation functions which describe the atomic structure of disordered materials .",
    "as these correlation functions have different spatial regimes , they may be classed as non - stationary signals . despite the overwhelming success of the wt in other fields , we are aware of only one other paper on this application of the wt . in that application , ding et al .",
    "@xcite studied an experimentally observed correlation function of vitreous silica using the mexican hat wavelet .",
    "we improve upon this single , prior application in three significant ways , namely the use of the complex wt , a ` tunable ' wavelet and the method of interpreting the resulting transforms .",
    "we then analyze the reduced radial distribution function ( rrdf ) of a structural model of a one - component glass with pronounced icosahedral local order  @xcite .",
    "the resulting wt clearly shows the existence of different frequency components in the rrdf and their exponential decay .",
    "these features were not clearly detectable by earlier methods ( c.f .  ref .  ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] we review the mathematical framework of the wavelet transform and discuss some mother wavelet functions before modifying an existing wavelet for our purposes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : instantaneous frequency and amplitude ] we consider the wt of a general oscillatory signal using the new wavelet .",
    "the results are then used to interpret the wavelet transforms of a variable - frequency example function in sec .",
    "[ sec : example function ] and of the rrdf in sec .",
    "[ sec : reduced radial distribution function ] .",
    "concluding remarks can be found in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the underlying wt used in this paper can be completely described as a one - dimensional complex , continuous wt using wavelets of constant shape  @xcite .",
    "we begin by examining the formulation of this wt in terms of an integral transform , before examining the choice of mother wavelet function .",
    "for simplicity we use time - frequency terminology , considering the signal to be an input function of time , @xmath0 .",
    "the cwt is an integral transformation which expands an input function @xmath0 in terms of a complete set of basis functions @xmath1 .",
    "these basis functions are all the same shape as they are defined in terms of dilation by @xmath2 and translation by @xmath3 of a mother wavelet function @xmath4:@xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the cwt @xmath8 is defined as the inner product:@xmath9    the original formulation of the cwt  @xcite used a prefactor @xmath10 to give a normalization to unity , @xmath11 ) .",
    "we choose an alternative prefactor @xmath12 ( giving @xmath13 ) after delprat et al .  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , this formulation of the cwt allows for simple frequency identification by examining the maxima in the modulus of the cwt with respect to the scale @xmath2 .    in order to understand the cwt",
    ", it is useful to relate it to the ft .",
    "the ft has a non - localized , plane - wave basis set and , therefore , has a single transform parameter - the frequency @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , the basis set of the cwt contains localized oscillations characterised by two transform parameters - the scale ( or dilation ) @xmath2 and the translation ( or position ) @xmath3 .",
    "it is this critical difference which makes the cwt preferable for the analysis of non - stationary signals .",
    "we are free to choose a functional form for @xmath4 , subject to some constraints .",
    "some of these constraints are forced upon us whereas others arise from the practical usefulness of the resulting transform .    in order to recover a function from its wavelet",
    "transform via the _ resolution of the identity _",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 must satisfy an _",
    "admissibility condition_. although we do not make direct use of the resolution of the identity in this paper , we require that our choice of @xmath4 satisfies this condition to ensure that all information about the signal is retained by the transform .",
    "the admissibility condition is essentially that the ft , @xmath15 , satisfies the relation @xmath16 , equivalent to requiring that the mother wavelet and , hence , the basis wavelets , have a mean of zero .    beyond simply satisfying the admissibility condition , it is practically useful to create mother wavelet functions which mimic features of interest in the signal . in the case of time - frequency analysis ,",
    "mother wavelet functions are chosen which represent localized sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "the resulting wavelet transforms can then be used to extract instantaneous measures of frequency and amplitude .",
    "the uncertainty principle dictates that the product @xmath17 of the time and frequency uncertainties of such wavelets has a lower bound .",
    "it is no surprise , therefore , that this class of mother wavelet functions are typically based upon gaussians .",
    "however , it is still possible to trade temporal precision for frequency precision by altering the number of oscillations in the envelope of the mother wavelet .",
    "the simplest such wavelet is the `` mexican hat '' wavelet which mimics a single oscillation and is commonly used in signal analysis .",
    "the functional form of this wavelet is the second derivative of a gaussian .",
    "this wavelet offers good localisation in the time domain whilst retaining admissibility .",
    "however , this wavelet has two major drawbacks for general signal analysis : ( i ) useful information can only be extracted from the wt at discrete intervals where the wavelets are in phase with the signal , and ( ii ) the time - frequency resolution is fixed .",
    "the former drawback has been overcome by the invention of complex wavelets which mimic localized plane waves .",
    "the wt can be computed separately for the real and imaginary parts , yielding a complex scalar field , @xmath8 , where the modulus and argument of @xmath18 represent the amplitude and phase of the signal , respectively .",
    "the latter drawback has been overcome by the invention of tunable wavelets which include an additional parameter to the mother wavelet function controlling the number of oscillations in the envelope .",
    "goupillaud , morlet and grossman overcame these problems simultaneously with the invention of a modulated gaussian wavelet , now known as the `` morlet '' wavelet  @xcite .",
    "this wavelet has a parameter , @xmath19 , which controls the number of oscillations in the envelope , allowing time and frequency uncertainties to be traded .",
    "thus the morlet wavelet can be expressed as:@xmath20 where @xmath21 and the parameter @xmath22 allows the admissibility condition to be satisfied .",
    "the ft of this wavelet is:@xmath23    from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : spectrum of the morlet wavelet ] ) it is clear that the admissibility condition @xmath24 implies that @xmath25    many previous applications of the morlet wavelet have been concerned with signals containing slowly varying frequency and amplitude components for which large values of @xmath19 ( @xmath26 ) are applicable and @xmath22 ( @xmath27 ) is negligible  @xcite .",
    "however , we are interested in applying this type of analysis to signals which contain rapidly varying frequencies and amplitudes . in this case",
    ", the ability to use small values of @xmath19 becomes important as we wish to maximize the temporal resolution by minimizing @xmath19 whilst still being able to separate the various frequency components in the signal and , consequently , @xmath22 is no longer negligible .",
    "although the morlet wavelet is admissible at small @xmath19 , the temporal localization is unsatisfactory ( see fig .  [ fig : envelope of the morlet wavelet ] ) ; namely , @xmath28 undergoes a transition from mono - modality to bimodality ( a single ridge at large @xmath19 splits into two symmetric ridges for small @xmath19 ) .",
    "the wavelet transform of a signal performed using a wavelet which has a bimodal envelope results in the signal being localized about two different positions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : morlet wavelet sigma=3d1 ] ) .",
    "this produces unwanted artefacts in the resulting instantaneous frequency and amplitude measurements ( shown later in figs .",
    "[ fig : example function wt period ] and [ fig : example function wt amplitude ] ) .",
    "therefore we remedy this drawback by modifying the morlet wavelet to produce a new wavelet , @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 has a single , global maximum for all @xmath19 . for the new wavelet we choose to replace the single , normalization constant @xmath31 in the morlet wavelet with two new parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 determined by two conditions : ( i ) total normalization of the wavelet to unity , and ( ii ) equal contributions to the normalization from the real and imaginary parts .",
    "the new wavelet has the following functional form:@xmath34 , \\label{eqn : harrop wavelet } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by :    @xmath35    the fourier transform of this wavelet is:@xmath36 .\\label{eqn : harrop wavelet spectrum } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is worthwhile noting that the real part of this new wavelet recovers the functional form of the mexican hat wavelet in the limit @xmath37:@xmath38 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\pi ^{-\\frac{1}{4}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}}(t^{2}-1).\\ ] ] thus the new wavelet allows a complete transition from very high temporal localization , @xmath37 ( the mexican hat wavelet ) , to maximum frequency localization , @xmath39 ( plane wave ) . even in the limit of minimal @xmath19 , @xmath30 remains mono - modal ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : envelope of the harrop wavelet ] and [ fig : harrop wavelet sigma=3d1 ] ) .",
    "thus we have improved upon the temporal localisation of the morlet wavelet .",
    "we have also checked that , using the new wavelet , the original signal can be recovered by the resolution of the identity operator .",
    "in this section we demonstrate how the new wavelet may be used to extract instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes from a signal via the cwt .",
    "the following analysis is based upon the stationary - phase approach of delprat et al .",
    "@xcite but is specialized to the new wavelet .",
    "the wavelet transform @xmath8 at a given scale @xmath2 and translation @xmath3 is given by the integral ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : integral expression for the wavelet transform ] ) of a rapidly oscillating integrand .",
    "this integral may be rewritten in the form:@xmath40 where :    @xmath41    with @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 .    in order to take the integral in the stationary - phase approximation , we first approximate @xmath44 by a gaussian . from eq .",

    "( [ eqn : approximate psi envelope ] ) into the integral , which can then be taken .",

    "the scale @xmath59 of this wavelet identifies the instantaneous frequency of the signal and may be found as the solution of the equation @xmath61 . from the definition of the points of stationary phase ( @xmath62 )",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath63 , an alternative equation which can be used to find @xmath59 . with the choice of normalization used in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dilation and translation of the mother wavelet ] ) , it is clear that these points maximize the expression for the squared modulus of the cwt with respect to @xmath2 as obtained by the stationary - phase approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : slow frequency variation form of the wt ] ) .    as the cwt is a linear operation , superimposed frequency components",
    "are manifested as different scales @xmath64 which locally maximize @xmath65 ( assuming sufficiently large @xmath19 to resolve the peaks ) .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the other approximation to the instantaneous frequency uses the equality of the frequency of the signal and of the wavelet on a ridge to create an expression for the frequency of the signal as a function of the scale @xmath59 on the ridge and the frequency of the mother wavelet , @xmath73:@xmath74    conventionally , @xmath75 is taken to be the underlying modulating frequency , @xmath19 , of the mother wavelet function .",
    "however , this is a poor approximation at small @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the obvious definition of @xmath75 is the modal average ( position of the highest peak ) in the fourier power spectrum @xmath76 .",
    "unfortunately , this expression for @xmath75 can not be found analytically .",
    "however , even at small @xmath19 , the spectrum @xmath76 is nearly symmetric about the main peak ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : harrop wavelet spectrum at sigma=3d0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the mean average is always a good approximation to the modal average ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : harrop wavelet mean and mode frequency ] ) and , unlike the mode , the mean can be found analytically :    @xmath77    using this expression for @xmath75 in conjunction with the relationship between scale and frequency in eq .",
