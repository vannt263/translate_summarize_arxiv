    "after the early attempts by sudarshan _",
    "et al . _ ( refs .  @xcite and feinberg ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) , tachyonic field theory has been scrutinized because a number of problematic issues were discovered and discussed at length in the literature  @xcite .",
    "insightful reviews on the history of tachyonic quantum dynamics and tachyonic quantum field theory are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . _ a priori _ , lorentz invariance does not imply that velocities greater than the speed of light are forbidden in nature .",
    "the lorentz transformation singles out the speed of light as a limiting velocity , not as the maximum velocity allowed in nature .",
    "indeed , superluminal lorentz transformations have been discussed in some detail in the literature ( e.g. , in refs .",
    "a superluminal particle can not be stopped , its velocity always remains greater than the speed of light , when measured from subluminal frames of reference .",
    "the einstein addition theorem remains valid for superluminal particles .",
    "the velocity @xmath2 of a superluminal particle measured in a moving frame , @xmath3 always is superluminal , @xmath4 , if @xmath5 is superluminal in the rest frame , and the relative velocity of the frames fulfills @xmath6 , as a quick inspection shows .",
    "( we set the speed of light @xmath7 in this article . )",
    "tachyons are particles whose dispersion relation reads as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ( magnitude of the ) velocity of the particle .",
    "the `` rest frame '' of a tachyon is the frame of infinite velocity , where the energy @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "provided the mass term @xmath11 is not in itself energy - dependent , a tachyon becomes faster as it loses energy , by virtue of the lorentz - invariant dispersion relation  .",
    "note that @xmath12 , because @xmath5 . while the relation @xmath13 is obtained from the usual ( tardyonic ) dispersion relation @xmath14 by the simple replacement @xmath15",
    ", the equations describing tachyonic particles do _ not _ follow from the wave equations for subluminal particles by the same , simple replacement .",
    "rather , the following equation , @xmath16 has been proposed for tachyonic spin-@xmath0 particles  @xcite . here , the @xmath17 are the dirac matrices , and @xmath18 is the derivative with respect to space - time coordinates , whereas @xmath19 is the fifth current matrix . in hamiltonian form , the equation reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this hamiltonian is not hermitian but pseudo - hermitian  @xcite and has the property @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the matrix representation of parity and @xmath25 is the full parity transformation .",
    "the pseudo - hermitian property makes the hamiltonian usable for practical calculations  @xcite and ensures that its energy eigenvalues are real or come in complex - conjugate pairs . in view of @xmath26 , the matrix multiplying the tachyonic mass term in eq .",
    "is multiplied by a matrix representation of the imaginary unit rather than by the imaginary unit itself .",
    "the quantum dynamics induced by the hamiltonian   have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and imply that all resonance energies in the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath27 fulfill the tachyonic dispersion relation  .",
    "the main problems in the construction of a tachyonic field theory are as follows . under a lorentz boost with velocity @xmath28 , as emphasized by feinberg  @xcite , the energy and momentum of a particle transform as @xmath29 into the moving frame , in analogy to @xmath30 ( we assume @xmath31 ) . under certain conditions ,",
    "we thus transform @xmath32 into @xmath33 upon lorentz transformation , if the particle is tachyonic ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , some of the particle annihilation operators transform into antiparticle creation operators under lorentz transformations ; the separation of the field operator into creation and annihilation contributions is no longer lorentz invariant .",
    "the sign change in @xmath35 occurs precisely if and only if the time @xmath36 a also changes sign under a lorentz transformation .",
    "therefore , if we accept the fact that the vacuum undergoes a lorentz transformation , then the calculated cross sections actually are lorentz invariant  @xcite .",
    "this is tied to the feinberg ",
    "sudarshan reinterpretation principle  @xcite .",
    "note that in ordinary quantum field theory , the identification of antiparticles as negative - energy particles traveling backward in time ( equivalent to positive - energy antiparticles traveling forward in time , with the values of all additive physical quantities reversed ) is also tied to a reinterpretation principle .",
    "the difference between the reinterpretation principle for tardyonic versus tachyonic particles is not in the reversal of the arrow of time ; it is solely in the fact that in the case of tachyonic particles and antiparticles , the separation into creation and annihilation parts is not lorentz - invariant .",
    "if one does not separate the field operator into annihilation and creation parts , then one has to write it down in terms of annihilation operators only  @xcite .",
    "this could seem to be attractive because the separation in this case is lorentz - invariant , but one then has to perform considerable effort in the calculation of a propagator , even in the case of scalar tachyonic particles  @xcite .",
    "we therefore prefer to use the concept originally developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , even if the lorentz covariance of the vacuum is extremely painful from the point of view of axiomatic field theory .",
    "we note , that the lorentz - mediated conversion of creation into annihilation operators is restricted to a small kinematic domain . using eq .  , we have @xmath37 and therefore @xmath33 if and only if @xmath38 . for two laboratories on earth traveling with respect to each other at a relative velocity of @xmath39 ,",
    "this means that the creation / annihilation paradox affects only those tachyonic states with @xmath40 , i.e. , tachyonic particles with energies @xmath41 . for a hypothetical tachyonic neutrino with a tachyonic mass of @xmath42 ,",
    "this affects neutrino states with energies @xmath43 , which are clearly irrelevant for laboratory - based measurements ( see also the discussion below in sec .",
    "[ insight ] for further insight into this problem ) .",
    "another conceptual problem has never been satisfactorily addressed in the literature : namely , if we try to solve either the tachyonic klein - gordon or the tachyonic dirac equation using a plane - wave _ ansatz _ of the form @xmath44 , then the tachyonic energy @xmath45 becomes imaginary for @xmath46 ( we here anticipate the @xmath47 prescription _  la faon feynmanienne _ ) .",
    "if one restricts the domain of allowed momenta to the region @xmath46 , then the plain - wave solution proportional to @xmath44 do not form a complete set of eigenstates of the hamiltonian any more .",
    "fourier transformation becomes problematic , and also , a tachyonic wave packet proportional to a dirac-@xmath48 ( eigenstate of the position operator ) can not be expanded into plain - wave eigenstates any longer .",
    "this has led to criticism  @xcite .",
    "we here argue that the states with @xmath49 should _ not _ be excluded from the theory . in the mathematical sense ,",
    "the states with @xmath49 constitute resonances of the tachyonic hamiltonian with complex resonance eigenvalues ( resonances for @xmath50 and antiresonances for @xmath51 ) . if one allows the resonances , then the domain of allowed wave vectors is no longer restricted .",
    "one can then localize ( and measure the position of ) a tachyonic particle , and furthermore , field - anticommutators and propagators assume their usual , localized form . the decay ( in time ) of the resonances",
    "is thus interpreted as a genuine property of the tachyonic field when observed from a subluminal reference frame .",
    "the observation of the tachyonic wave packet from a subluminal frame leads to the elimination ( evanescence ) of subluminal components from the propagating tachyonic wave packets ; the components with @xmath49 constitute evanescent waves .",
    "such a situation is not uncommon in physics .",
    "e.g. , a particle bound in a cubic anharmonic oscillator potential is propagated via resonances with complex - valued resonance energies  @xcite ; the energies become complex because a classical particle in a cubic potential escapes to infinity in finite time .",
    "the corresponding matter waves are evanescent .",
    "we have no better interpretation but to assert that for a particle visiting us `` from the other side of the light barrier , '' subluminal components in wave packets must be suppressed ( evanescent ) because they are incompatible with the genuine superluminal nature of the tachyonic particle .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath52 damps the particle solutions ( positive energy , forward in time ) and the antiparticle solutions ( negative energy , backward in time ) consistently such as to dampen the wave amplitude accordingly .",
    "the formalism detailing all above mentioned concepts is outlined below , for the case of a tachyonic spin-@xmath0 particle .",
    "the question then is , given we are willing to invest so much effort in formulating a quantum field theory of tachyons , and given that we have to give up a number of esteemed axioms of field theory for incorporating them , what is the return of the investment ?",
    "we can state that ( i )  the tachyonic dirac equation seems to have exactly the right symmetries for the description of neutrinos  @xcite , ( ii )  the tachyonic dirac theory has the correct massless limit ( shown below ) , and ( iii )  the suppression of right - handed helicity neutrino states , and left - handed helicity antineutrino states , follows naturally from the tachyonic theory because the suppressed states have negative norm .",
    "furthermore ,  ( iv )  we need some form of a tachyonic field theory if the minos  @xcite and opera  @xcite data should stand the test of time , and if new measurements should confirm low - energy neutrino data  @xcite which show an apparent trend toward negative values for the neutrino mass square .",
    "( the neutrino mass square exhibits a clear trend toward negative values in all measurements , with the magnitude of the mass square increasing with the energy of the neutrino .",
    "the latter point is not subject of the discussion in the current article . )",
    "we proceed as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> the quantum field theory of superluminal ( tachyonic ) particles is plagued with a number of problems , which include the lorentz non - invariance of the vacuum state , the ambiguous separation of the field operator into creation and annihilation operators under lorentz transformations , and the necessity of a complex reinterpretation principle for quantum processes . </S>",
    "<S> another unsolved question concerns the treatment of subluminal components of a tachyonic wave packets in the field - theoretical formalism , and the calculation of the time - ordered propagator . after a brief discussion on related problems , we conclude that rather painful choices have to be made in order to incorporate tachyonic spin-@xmath0 particles into field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the field theory needs to be formulated such as to allow for localizable tachyonic particles , even if that means that a slight unitarity violation is introduced into the @xmath1 matrix , and we write down field operators with unrestricted momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we find that once these choices have been made , the propagator for the neutrino field can be given in a compact form , and the left - handedness of the neutrino as well as the right - handedness of the antineutrino follow naturally . </S>",
    "<S> consequences for neutrinoless double beta decay and superluminal propagation of neutrinos are briefly discussed . </S>"
