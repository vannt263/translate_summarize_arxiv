    "many advances in our understanding of nuclear structure have come from studying nuclei at the limits of existence , such as near the particle drip - lines . in very neutron - rich nuclei",
    "the discovery of nuclear halos  @xcite , neutron - skins  @xcite , and the emergence of new sub - shell closures and magic numbers  @xcite have provided stringent tests for nuclear models .",
    "the emergence of new magic numbers gives rise to the possibility of low - lying long - lived ( @xmath0  ms ) isomers , such as spin trap and k isomers  @xcite , in neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "nuclear isomers are of interest for a variety of reasons . in astrophysics",
    "isomers play a role in determining the abundances of the elements , since low lying isomers can be excited through thermal excitations in hot astrophysical environments  @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ the abundance of @xmath6al  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , isomers near new magic numbers in neutron - rich nuclei may play an important role in determining the r - process path .",
    "isomers also provide sensitive tests for nuclear models .",
    "the life - time of a nuclear state depends on the overlap between the excited and ground states , a small difference in a model wavefunction can lead to widely different predictions for nuclear half - lives  @xcite .",
    "additionally , nuclear isomers are intimately tied to nuclear structure through nuclear shapes and high spin states  @xcite .",
    "the production rates of very neutron - rich nuclei tend to be very low , and the possibility of half - lives greater than @xmath7  ms limits the potential to study these isomers in traditional @xmath8 and @xmath2-ray spectroscopy experiments .",
    "another hindrance for traditional spectroscopy experiments is the potential for contaminants or large backgrounds  @xcite from molecular beams of lighter nuclei .",
    "a viable alternative to study the excitation energies of these isomers , with lifetimes in the millisecond regime , is through mass measurements .",
    "two mass measurement techniques that can be used to measure nuclear isomers are storage rings and penning traps  @xcite .",
    "the ability to study nuclear isomers has been demonstrated at the gsi storage ring , with the discovery of long - lived isomers in neutron rich hafnium and tantalum isotopes  @xcite and in the proton rich nucleus @xmath9ce  @xcite .",
    "storage rings can measure isomer excitation energies as low as 100  kev  @xcite , however , the technique is limited to isomers with half - lives greater than several seconds due to the length of the cooling process .    penning traps have been shown to be the most precise mass spectrometers for stable  @xcite and unstable  @xcite isotopes .",
    "this property along with the ability to perform measurements with low count rates , as low as a few ions per hour as demonstrated by shiptrap  @xcite , allows nuclear structure to be studied in nuclides and isomers near the particle driplines . to facilitate the study of isomers in penning traps , it is desirable that the time of flight resonances , obtained by the time - of - flight ion - cyclotron resonance technique  @xcite , be separated by more than one full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the resonance line shape .",
    "the fwhm @xmath10 is proportional to the inverse of the radio - frequency excitation time @xmath11 as @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the ion is obtained from the cyclotron frequency @xmath13 which is extracted from a fit of the theoretical line shape .",
    "the cyclotron frequency of an ion in a homogeneous magnetic field is related to its mass as , @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the charge and mass of the ion of interest and @xmath17 is the magnetic field strength in the trap .",
    "thus , the resolving power @xmath18 required to separate an isomer from the ground state by one fhwm is , @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the atomic mass of the ground state of the nuclide of interest and @xmath21 is the difference in atomic masses of the isomer and ground state . in",
    "what follows resolved will be taken to mean separated by one fhwm of the line shape . since the charge state and the excitation time in the penning trap both enter into eq .",
    "( [ eq : precision_mass ] ) in the numerator a decrease in the excitation time can be compensated by the appropriate increase in the charge state . as a rule of thumb the excitation time is chosen according to the relation @xmath22 .    the ability to resolve isomers in penning traps",
    "was first demonstrated at isoltrap , where the isomeric states of @xmath23rb were seen  @xcite . if the hyperfine structure of a nucleus is known , then through state selective laser ionization it is possible to create isomerically pure beams from which the ground and isomer masses can be determined with a minimum of contamination  @xcite .",
    "if the hyperfine structure of the ground and isomeric states lie close to each other then it is possible to create pure beams by the use of an appropriate ion / penning trap cleaning technique  @xcite .",
    "the shortest of these cleaning techniques still requires upwards of one - hundred milliseconds and can not be used for nuclei and isomers with half - lives on the order of tens of milliseconds . penning traps can also be used as a discovery machine with the first observation of new nuclides  @xcite or isomeric states  @xcite , or to determine isomer excitation levels seen in decay spectroscopy  @xcite .",

    "<S> the use of highly charged ions increases the precision and resolving power , in particular for short - lived species produced at on - line radio - isotope beam facilities , achievable with penning trap mass spectrometers . </S>",
    "<S> this increase in resolving power provides a new and unique access to resolving low - lying long - lived ( @xmath0  ms ) nuclear isomers . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the @xmath1  kev ( determined from @xmath2-ray spectroscopy ) isomeric state in @xmath3rb has been resolved from the ground state , in a charge state of @xmath4 with the titan penning trap at the triumf - isac facility . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy of the isomer was measured to be @xmath5  kev above the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted masses for both the ground and isomeric states , and their difference , agree with the ame2003 and nuclear data sheet values . </S>",
    "<S> this proof of principle measurement demonstrates the feasibility of using penning trap mass spectrometers coupled to charge breeders to study nuclear isomers and opens a new route for isomer searches . </S>"
