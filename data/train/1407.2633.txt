    "there has been a great amount of interest in the field of research opened up by the discovery of materials known as topological insulators .",
    "@xcite topological insulators represent a new quantum state of matter that is characterized by bulk properties like those of ordinary band insulators , but supporting protected conducting boundary states on their edges or surfaces .",
    "these states are possible due to a combination of spin - orbit interactions and time - reversal symmetry .    the kane - mele model introduced in refs .   and",
    "is an example of a band insulator in two - dimensional space for which time - reversal symmetry guarantees the stability of gapless edge states that are perfectly conducting along any boundary .",
    "the kane - mele model is a tight - binding representation for electrons in graphene in the presence of an intrinsic spin - orbit coupling and of a rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "even though the magnitudes of the spin - orbit couplings in graphene are too small to lead to observable effects with the present experimental resolution in energy and temperature , the kane - mele model aroused considerable interest and led to the predictions and discoveries of @xmath1 topological insulators both in two- and three - dimensional space ( see refs .",
    ", , and   for reviews ) .",
    "the kane - mele model at vanishing uniform and staggered chemical potentials and in the absence of the rashba spin - orbit coupling simplifies to a reducible massive dirac hamiltonian with dirac matrices of rank 8 at long wave lengths and low energies . in turn , each irreducible block realizes a massive dirac hamiltonian with dirac matrices of rank 4 .",
    "there are thus two dirac masses that enter with opposite signs so that time - reversal symmetry holds .",
    "both the electronic charge and the projection of the electronic spin quantum number along the quantization axis in spin space are conserved when the rashba terms are switched off in the kane - mele hamiltonian .",
    "integration of the electrons in the kane - mele hamiltonian at vanishing uniform and staggered chemical potentials , without rashba terms , but coupled to two @xmath2 external gauge fields , one that couples to the conserved @xmath2 charge and one that couples to the @xmath2 spin current , delivers a double chern - simons ( cs ) theory.@xcite as there is a bulk - edge correspondence associated to each of the cs terms , there follows the existence and stability of an integer number of pairs of helical edge states in any geometry with boundaries .",
    "correspondingly , the kane - mele model in the absence of the rashba terms supports the quantum - spin hall effect.@xcite the quantization of the spin hall response is lost for any rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the insight of kane and mele was to recognize that , as long as time - reversal symmetry holds , a single pair of helical edge states persists in the form of a perfectly conducting channel , provided there was an odd number of pairs of helical edge states prior to switching on the ( not too large ) rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the goal of this work is to derive the effective quantum field theory in @xmath0-dimensional space and time that encodes at long wave lengths and low energies the kane - mele model at vanishing uniform and staggered chemical potentials together with an intrinsic spin - orbit coupling that dominates over a rashba spin - orbit coupling , and understand how the gapless edge dynamics arises from this bulk action . a brief summary with the main results of the paper follows .    starting with a dirac hamiltonian coupled to the pair @xmath3 and @xmath4 of gauge fields and after integrating out the massive dirac fermions",

    "this action is invariant under gauge transformations of the field @xmath3 as charge is conserved .",
    "it is not invariant under gauge transformations of the field @xmath4 as the spin-1/2 symmetry is completely broken by the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "as it is known for the quantum hall effect,@xcite gauge invariance is sufficient to show the existence of the propagating chiral states along the edge .",
    "the question we are thus after is how to construct the bulk - edge correspondence without the complete @xmath8 gauge invariance of the effective action when @xmath9 .",
    "the important point is that we can interpret the correction @xmath10 as a gauge fixing term . by using the faddeev - popov procedure ,",
