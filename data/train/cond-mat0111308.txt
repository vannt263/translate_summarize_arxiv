    "[ fig : linear],width=288 ]    if the density is sufficiently low and the interactions sufficiently weak , the nonlinear term in the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) can be neglected and the time - evolution of the matter field is accurately described by a linear schrdinger equation . in this case , the superposition principle holds and the transmission of the pulse can be well described in momentum space in terms of the wave vector - dependent transmission amplitude @xmath52 @xmath53 if the whole of the incident wave packet is contained in either a transmitting or a reflecting region of the spectrum ( fig.[fig : linear]a ) , it will be respectively transmitted ( fig.[fig : linear]b ) or reflected ( fig.[fig : linear]c ) without sensible reshaping . as it has been discussed in full detail in previous papers  @xcite",

    "[ fig : linearres],width=288 ]    when one or more resonance peaks due to quasi - bound modes are contained within the spectrum of the incident wave packet , the pulse will be partially reflected and partially transmitted ( fig.[fig : linearres]b - c ) ; the strong frequency dependence of the transmission amplitude leads to a profound reshaping of the spatial profile of the pulse ( fig.[fig : linearres]a ) .",
    "an incident pulse of linewidth much wider than the quasi - bound mode linewidth has in fact a time duration much shorter than the characteristic decay time of the mode ; this latter can therefore be considered as being impulsively excited by the incident pulse and than exponentially decaying on a much longer time scale . the exponential tail shown by the transmitted pulse profile when a single quasi - bound mode is excited ( dashed line in fig.[fig : linearres]a ) is a clear signature of transmission occurring via a single resonant quasi - bound mode  @xcite .",
    "if several isolated modes are instead present in the frequency interval encompassed by the incident spectrum , the spectrum of the transmitted pulse will contain several peaks ( fig.[fig : linearres]c ) and a complex shape will result from the interference of the different frequency components .",
    "for example , if the incident pulse has a duration comparable to the dephasing time of a pair of neighboring modes ( i.e. the inverse of their frequency difference ) , both of them will be impulsively excited and the profile of the transmitted pulse will show oscillations following the time evolution of the relative phase ( solid line in fig.[fig : linearres]a ) ; these oscillations can be interpreted as _ quantum beatings _ between the two coherently excited quasi - bound modes coupled to the same continuum of propagating modes outside the lattice",
    "for higher values of the atomic density and the coupling constant @xmath57 , the effect of the atom - atom interactions is no longer negligible and the mean - field nonlinear term @xmath58 in ( [ eq : gp ] ) starts playing an important role in the dynamics ; in the following , we shall focus on the experimentally most relevant case of a positive scattering length @xmath59 , which means a repulsive interaction among atoms in free space .    in  @xcite we discussed the case of a continuous wave ( cw ) beam of coherent atoms incident on a finite lattice ; depending on the detuning of the incident beam with respect to the frequency of a quasi - bound mode of the lattice , atom optical limiting or bistability",

    "[ fig : nonlrefl],width=288 ]    first we consider the case of an incident wave packet with a center - of - mass kinetic energy @xmath63 exactly on resonance with a quasi - bound mode ( fig.[fig : nonlinear]a ) : in the absence of interactions ( dashed line ) , the wave packet is nearly completely transmitted without any shape distortion ; only a small fraction of the pulse is reflected ( fig.[fig : nonlrefl]a ) .",
    "thanks to the resonance condition with the quasi - bound mode , the atomic density inside the lattice is significantly larger than the one in the incident wave packet . in the presence of interaction , the main effect of nonlinearity is to blue - shift the quasi - bound mode frequency  @xcite and push it out of resonance with the incident beam ; this negative feedback effect , already present in the cw treatment  @xcite , gives not only a saturation of the transmission as a function of the incident density , but also a significant reshaping of the wave packet : the higher density part is cut and the resulting wave packet is flattened .",
    "the negative feedback in the transmission obviously corresponds to a positive feedback in the reflection .    in the opposite case of a wave packet incident with a kinetic energy higher than the quasi - mode frequency ,",
    "a low density wave packet is nearly completely reflected ( fig.[fig : nonlinear]b , dashed line ) . at higher densities ,",
    "the cw calculations in  @xcite have predicted the appearance of atom optical bistability effects : several stationary states with different transmitted intensities can indeed be found for the same value of the incident intensity . on such grounds , we are able to put forward a physical interpretation of the transmitted pulse shape in the presence of interactions shown as a solid line in fig.[fig : nonlinear]b : only a small fraction of the leading part of the pulse is transmitted since the incident frequency is out of resonance with the empty quasi - bound mode ; moreover , this part of the incident wave packet has been accelerated by the repulsive mean - field interactions before reaching the lattice and thus pushed even further off resonance .",
    "for the same reason , the trailing part of the pulse has been instead slowed down with respect to the central velocity and thus results closer to resonance to the quasi - bound mode ; when this trailing part of the pulse reaches the lattice , the quasi - bound mode starts to be effectively populated .",
    "the main effect of the interactions among the atoms in the quasi - bound mode is to push its frequency closer to resonance with the incident wave packet : the sudden increase in the density of the transmitted pulse which is apparent in fig.[fig : nonlinear]b is a direct consequence of this positive feedback .",
    "this behaviour is analog to the jump from the lower to the upper branch of the bistability loop which occur in the cw case for incident intensities growing beyond the switch - on threshold .",
    "the shape of the reflected pulse is complementary to the one of the transmitted one : in the presence of the nonlinearity , the reflected pulse shows a dip corresponding to the switch - on of the transmission ( fig.[fig : nonlrefl]b ) .    provided",
    "the interaction energy is much smaller than the spacing of the different quasi - bound modes , the transmission dynamics is mostly determined by a single resonant mode and the shape of the matter field inside the lattice is fixed by the eigenfunction of the mode ; this guarantees that no _ modulational instability _  @xcite can take place even in the presence of an effectively attractive interaction such as the one which occurs in the case of negative mass @xmath64 valence band atoms for which the sign of the effective interaction is reversed with respect to free space .    in the absence of spatial confinement",
    ", a spatially extended wave packet of coherent valence band atoms is instead subjected to modulational instability : consider for example an attractive lattice and an incident wave packet with a kinetic energy just below the lower edge of the gap . in the present paper",
    "we shall limit ourselves to the case of a sufficiently weak nonlinearity @xmath65 in order for the band structure of the atomic dispersion not to be washed out by the interaction term . since propagating valence band states are available at all spatial positions ,",
    "the pulse is able to penetrate inside the lattice without any reflection .",
    "as soon as the pulse is in the lattice , the modulational instability sets in and the initially uniform envelope starts being modulated with an amplitude which grows exponentially in time ; at the end , a train of short and intense pulses is found ( fig.[fig : modinstab ] ) .",
    "the seed for this modulational instability is automatically provided by the density modulations which inevitably arise while the pulse is entering the non - uniform lattice . in order to make the discussion the simplest ,",
    "this has been assumed to have an uniform depth in its central part and wings at its ends ; after the initial preparation phase , the pulses therefore propagate through an effectively uniform system .",
    ", @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) across an attractive lattice ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the lattice has a flat profile in the central @xmath69 region and gaussian ( @xmath70 ) wings ; its spatial extension is indicated by the vertical dashed lines .",
    "[ fig : modinstab],width=288 ]    a similar modulational instability is well - known to occur in nonlinear bragg fiber optics  @xcite ; a cw laser beam traveling in the conduction ( valence ) photonic band of a bragg lattice with a focusing ( defocusing ) nonlinear refractive index is subjected to self - pulsation and therefore converted into a train of pulses .",
    "since the nonlinear refraction index can be interpreted as an effective photon - photon interaction  @xcite , the self - pulsing effect is easily interpreted as the modulational instability following the presence of an effectively attractive interaction .",
    "a regular train of short optical pulses with a well defined period and intensity has been theoretically shown to be produced if the modulational instability of a cw laser beam propagating in a lattice is seeded with a weak periodic intensity modulation  @xcite .",
    "the shape of each pulse is stable during propagation since the group velocity dispersion is counterbalanced by the optical nonlinearity . following the literature",
    ", we shall call these pulses _ gap solitons _  @xcite , even if from a strictly mathematical point of view they could be classified only as _ solitary waves _ , since the wave equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) in a periodic potential is not exactly integrable  @xcite and collisions between two such solitons do not exactly preserve the pulse shape  @xcite ; as we shall see in the following , the expression _ gap soliton _ is however physically justified by the fact that the pulse distortion following a collision is generally small . since the first observation of optical gap solitons in 1995 , intense experimental activity is actually in progress for the generation and characterization of gap solitons and bragg modulational instabilities in optical fibers  @xcite .    in very recent years ,",
    "solitonic excitations are beginning to be investigated also in the context of nonlinear atom optics  @xcite : dark solitons in the form of stable density dips in a otherwise uniform condensate have been recently observed  @xcite ; bright gap solitons  @xcite and modulational instabilities  @xcite are actually under intense investigation ; despite the positive atom - atom scattering length , such stable atomic pulses can exist inside an optical lattice thanks to the negative effective mass of valence band atoms . in the present section we present a new method to generate narrow bright gap solitons starting from a wide atomic condensate incident on an optical lattice",
    "consider a long coherent matter wave pulse ( i.e. a bose - condensed atomic cloud ) incident on the same attractive lattice as in the previous section with a kinetic energy just above the lower edge of the gap . at linear regime ,",
    "such a wave packet is nearly completely reflected so that the interference of the incident and reflected waves creates a standing wave pattern in front of the reflection point . far outside the lattice ,",
    "the period of the pattern is fixed by the wave vector @xmath47 of the incident wave packet and is therefore of the order of the lattice period @xmath9 . inside the lattice ,",
    "the standing wave pattern originates instead from the interference of a forward and a backward bloch waves : the amplitude of the fast oscillations follows from the density modulation of each bloch wave function with a periodicity @xmath71 , while the local period of the slower modulation which originates from the interference of the two bloch waves @xmath72 is equal to @xmath73 .",
    "as we approach the reflection point , the bloch waves approach to the band edge , so that @xmath74 and the period of the modulation is strongly increased with respect to the lattice period , although it still remains much shorter than the size of incident wave ; this effect is apparent in the leftmost snapshot of fig.[fig : solit ] .    , @xmath66 , @xmath75 ; same lattice parameters as in fig.[fig : modinstab ] ) : pulse shape snapshots at different times .",
    "vertical dashed lines indicate the spatial extension of the lattice ; the dot - dashed line indicate the reflection point at linear regime .",
    "[ fig : solit],width=288 ]    provided the nonlinear term is sufficiently small , the interactions do not wash out the standing wave interference pattern  @xcite but simply blue - shift the local band edge at the spatial position of the rightmost antinodes ; in this way , the wave packet frequency is pushed out from the local gap and valence band states result available for propagation .",
    "the resulting short pulses , stabilized by the effective attractive interaction , can therefore propagate along the lattice as solitonic objects .",
    "the higher the density , the larger the number of pulses for which this mechanism is effective and which are then able to propagate along all the lattice without being reflected . by carefully choosing the density ,",
    "a single soliton can be launched along the lattice ( fig.[fig : solit ] ) ; unfortunately , given the complexity of the nucleation process , it is not physically evident how the parameters of the soliton ( e.g. the group velocity @xmath76 and the peak density ) can be controlled by acting on the parameters of the wide incident bose - condensate .",
    "once the pulse has crossed the flat region of the lattice and has got to its opposite end , the effective mass of the atoms becomes positive again and the pulse is immediately broadened under the combined effect of group velocity dispersion and mean field repulsion ( see the two last snapshots in fig.[fig : solit ] ) .",
    "a proof of the solitonic nature of the generated pulse is obtained from a study of its collisional dynamics ( fig.[fig : collis ] ) : a pair of such pulses symmetrically generated at the two ends of the lattice collide in the middle of the lattice .",
    "their solitonic properties result clearly from the fact that their shapes as well as the number of atoms contained in each of them are only weakly affected by the collision process .",
    "the small broadening of the pulses that can be observed in fig.[fig : collis ] is a signature of the fact that the nonlinear wave equation in a periodic potential is integrable only in an approximate way  @xcite .     and",
    "propagating along the lattice with opposite velocities .",
    "all the collisional dynamics takes place in the region @xmath69 where the lattice profile is flat .",
    "[ fig : collis],width=288 ]    thanks to the effective mass @xmath38 much smaller than the free space mass @xmath17 ( for the parameters of fig.[fig : solit ] @xmath77 ) , the solitonic width is significantly larger than the free space healing length at the same value of the density ; for a typical value of the lattice period of the order of @xmath78 , the solitonic length turns out of the order of @xmath79 which is well within the capabilities of actual detection systems .",
    "the mean - field interaction energies required for the observation of solitonic effects are in general smaller or of the order of one tenth of the recoil energy @xmath80 : for the most relevant case of @xmath81rb atoms and @xmath82na , this value corresponds to reasonable densities of the order of @xmath83 .",
    "the characteristic time for the modulational instability and soliton formation processes described in the previous sections is of the order of @xmath84 , which means @xmath85 for @xmath82rb atoms and @xmath86 for @xmath81na .",
    "the method here described for the generation of bright gap solitons is significantly different from previous proposals  @xcite : in our approach the soliton pulse shape originates not from the whole bec cloud , but only from the much shorter density bump corresponding to an antinode of the standing matter wave .",
    "this fact allows one to obtain short solitons from a wide bec without the need for a dramatic pulse compression under the effect of effectively attractive interactions .",
    "provided the gap soliton is wide enough , only a narrow group of bloch states around a central wave vector @xmath87 are populated and an accurate description can be analytically obtained within the so - called envelope function framework : denoting with @xmath88 the bloch eigenfunction at @xmath89 , we write the wave function @xmath90 of the coherent matter pulse as the product of the slowly varying envelope @xmath91 and the fastly oscillating bloch eigenfunction @xmath88 @xmath92 in the following , the bloch eigenfunction @xmath93 is assumed to be normalized according to @xmath94 which corresponds to @xmath95 in the @xmath96 basis of ( [ eq : twomodes ] ) . if its variations of the envelope @xmath91 are slow enough , it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath91 obeys a simple integrable nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xmath97 in which the effective mass @xmath38 and the effective coupling @xmath98 depend on the central wave vector @xmath87 ; obviously , the stability of the solitonic pulse requires @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath87 close to the upper edge of the valence band at @xmath100 .",
    "while an explicit expression for @xmath101 has been already given in ( [ eq : meff ] ) , the effective coupling @xmath102 turns out to be expressed in terms of the bloch wave function by @xmath103 within the two - mode ansatz ( [ eq : twomodes ] ) , this quantity can be rewritten in the simple form @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the projections of the bloch eigenfunction on the forward and backward propagating waves .",
    "notice that the density modulation of the bloch wavefunction at gap edge ( @xmath106 ) makes the effective coupling a factor @xmath107 larger than the one far from the gap , i.e. the free - space one .     in fig.[fig :",

    "the accuracy of this approximate description is apparent in fig.[fig : solit2 ] where we compare the numerically obtained wave packet with the analytical prediction ( [ eq : solitanal ] ) for the envelope ; the central wave vector @xmath87 of the wave packet has been determined from the group velocity by means of ( [ eq : vg ] ) , the envelope amplitude @xmath114 from the peak density of the pulse .",
    "in this paper we have theoretically investigated the transmission dynamics of coherent matter pulses ( such as those that can be extracted from bose - einstein condensates ) which incide on finite optical lattices ; such systems are matter wave analogs of the nonlinear bragg fibers currently studied in nonlinear optics .    at linear regime ( i.e. in the low - density or weak - interaction limit ) , we have characterized the dependence of the intensity and shape of the transmitted pulse on the velocity and size of the incident condensate in terms of the dispersion of matter waves inside the lattice ; as in the case of light waves in periodic dielectric structures or in the case of electrons in crystalline solids , the dispersion of matter waves in the periodic potential of optical lattices is in fact characterized by allowed bands and forbidden gaps .    the dynamics in the presence of interactions is found to be even richer : an interpretation of the numerically predicted effects is put forward in terms of familiar concepts from nonlinear optics , such as optical limiting , optical bistability , and modulational instability .    in particular , we have investigated a possible way of generating narrow bright gap solitons from a wide incident bose - condensate : the modulational instability is seeded from the strongly modulated density profile of the standing wave which is formed in front of the finite optical lattice by the interference of the incident and reflected matter waves .",
    "the solitonic nature of the generated pulses has been checked from their shape which is in excellent agreement with a simple analytical model as well as from their dynamical and collisional properties .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate the transmission dynamics of coherent matter wave pulses across finite optical lattices in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the shape and the intensity of the transmitted pulse are found to strongly depend on the parameters of the incident pulse , in particular its velocity and density : a clear physical picture for the main features observed in the numerical simulations is given in terms of the atomic band dispersion in the periodic potential of the optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> signatures of nonlinear effects due the atom - atom interaction are discussed in detail , such as atom optical limiting and atom optical bistability . for positive scattering lengths , </S>",
    "<S> matter waves propagating close to the top of the valence band are shown to be subject to modulational instability . </S>",
    "<S> a new scheme for the experimental generation of narrow bright gap solitons from a wide bose - einstein condensate is proposed : the modulational instability is seeded in a controlled way starting from the strongly modulated density profile of a standing matter wave and the solitonic nature of the generated pulses is checked from their shape and their collisional properties .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , a great interest has been devoted to theoretical as well as experimental studies of the propagation of matter waves in the periodic potential of optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the first experiments were carried out using ultracold atomic samples  @xcite ; later on , the realization of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite and their coherent loading into optical lattices  @xcite have opened the possibility of investigating features which follow from the coherent nature of the bose - condensed atomic sample  @xcite .    at the same time , the propagation of light waves in linear and nonlinear periodic dielectric structures has been a very active field of research : global photonic band gaps ( pbg ) have been observed  @xcite and one - dimensional nonlinear periodic systems such as nonlinear bragg fibers  @xcite are actually under intense investigation given the wealth of different phenomena including optical bistability , modulational instability and solitonic propagation that can be observed  @xcite .    given the very close analogy between the behavior of coherent matter waves and nonlinear optics , we expect that the concepts currently used to study the physics of nonlinear bragg fibers can be fruitfully extended to the physics of coherent matter waves in optical lattices : the optical potential of the lattice plays in fact the role of the periodic refractive index , the atom - atom interactions are the atom - optical analog of a kerr - like nonlinear refractive index and the gross - pitaevskii equation of mean - field theory corresponds to maxwell s equation with a nonlinear polarization term  @xcite .    in the present paper , we shall report a theoretical investigation of the transmission dynamics of coherent matter pulses which incide onto a finite optical lattice with a velocity of the order of the bragg velocity . in this velocity range , </S>",
    "<S> bragg reflection processes are most effective and the atomic dispersion in the lattice is completely different from the free - space one . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the value of the density , spatial size and velocity of the incident atomic cloud , as well as on the depth and length of the lattice , a number of different behaviors are predicted by numerical simulations ; here , we shall focus our attention on the shape of the transmitted pulse just after it has crossed the lattice as well as while it is still propagating in the lattice . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we shall discuss a new mechanism which can be used to generate narrow bright atomic gap solitons propagating along the lattice starting from a wide incident bose - einstein condensate . for more details on the continuous - wave transmission and reflection spectra at linear regime </S>",
    "<S> , the reader can refer to  @xcite ; some aspects of the linear pulse dynamics are discussed in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the geometry considered in the present paper as well as in  @xcite is significantly different from the one usually considered in recent experimental works  @xcite of bec dynamics in optical lattices in which an optical lattice is switched on and superimposed to a stationary condensate ; the dynamics of the condensate inside the lattice is then studied in response to some external force such as gravity , an acceleration of the lattice , or a spatial translation of the magnetic potential .    the present paper is organized as follows : sec.[sec : system ] describes the physical system under examination . in sec.[sec : bands ] we review some basic concepts on the dispersion of matter waves in the periodic potential of an infinite optical lattice and present some simple analytical calculations which accurately reproduce the dispersion of the atomic bands in the neighborhood of the first forbidden gap . </S>",
    "<S> the linear regime propagation of coherent matter wave pulses across finite lattices is the subject of sec.[sec : linear ] . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity as well as the shape of the transmitted pulse are found to strongly depend on the properties of the weak incident pulse , in particular its velocity and spatial size ; a simple interpretation of the observed phenomena in terms of allowed bands and forbidden gaps is provided . in sec.[sec : nonlinear ] , we discuss the effect of atom - atom interactions on the propagation of the pulse in the different cases : simple explanations for the observed behavior are put forward in terms of familiar concepts of nonlinear optics such as optical limiting , optical bistability , or modulational instability ; in particular , modulational instability is shown to occur for positive scattering length atoms when the matter wave is propagating at the top of the valence band ; at this point of the dispersion , the effective mass is in fact negative . in sec.[sec : soliton ] , we propose a new scheme to control the modulational instability of valence band atoms in order to obtain a narrow bright gap soliton from a wide condensate : as an initial seed for the instability , the standing matter wave pattern created by the interference of the incident and reflected waves is used . </S>",
    "<S> the solitonic nature of the generated pulses is verified by looking at their dynamical and collisional properties as well as by comparing the pulse shape with the analytical predictions of the envelope - function approximation discussed in sec.[sec : solitanal ] . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions are finally drawn in sec.[sec : conclu ] . </S>"
