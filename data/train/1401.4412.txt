    "it is well known that horizontal seismometers are sensitive to ground rotation at low frequencies.@xcite indeed , due to the equivalence principle , conventional seismometers and tiltmeters can not distinguish between horizontal acceleration and rotation of the ground .",
    "while this is a problem in precision seismology , it is especially problematic for seismic isolation in next - generation gravitational - wave detectors , such as advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( aligo ) , where it is believed that rotation noise may limit improvements in low - frequency isolation.@xcite    conventional horizontal seismometers can be idealized as horizontal spring - mass systems whose horizontal displacement is sensed relative to the housing . similarly , conventional tiltmeters or inclinometers can be idealized as vertical pendulums whose horizontal displacement is sensed relative to the housing .",

    "due to the @xmath10 in the denominator , response to rotation dominates at low frequencies ( typically @xmath11 mhz ) .",
    "similarly for a pendulum tiltmeter , the displacement of the bob due to a rotation is indistinguishable from that due to a horizontal acceleration at frequencies well below the resonance frequency .",

    "an important limitation of the active - control system for seismic isolation in aligo is this inability of horizontal seismometers to distinguish between ground rotation and horizontal acceleration at low frequencies ( @xmath13 to @xmath14 mhz@xcite ) .",
    "slow ground rotation , such as that induced by wind , would be misinterpreted as large ground displacements , which could cause a large correction to be applied at the low - frequency active - isolation stages . this large displacement can produce noise in the gravitational - wave signal band through frequency up - conversion mechanisms , non - linearities , and cross - couplings .",
    "this problem can be addressed by measuring the absolute ground rotation and removing it from the seismometer channels before it has a chance to enter the isolation system .",
    "our rotation sensor design may also be important to the field of rotational seismology.@xcite large ring - laser gyroscopes are the traditional rotation sensors used in this field.@xcite they are traditionally run horizontally to sense rotation about the vertical axis , but can be mounted vertically to sense rotation about a horizontal axis.@xcite our design offers a simpler and more compact alternative . for comparison , it has roughly an order of magnitude better angle sensitivity than the horizontal - axis ring - laser gyroscope described in belfi _ _ et al.__@xcite between 10 to 100 mhz . in this frequency band ,",

    "however , this option allows referencing to a surface other than the platform to which the balance is bolted .",
    "this would prove useful if we were to read the rotation of a surface that could not support the weight of the entire balance .",
    "the reference pattern readout is also a measure of the intrinsic autocollimator noise .",

    "[ corr ] shows the angle spectral density from a 4000-s dataset recorded during the day with both instruments .",
    "the angle measured by the rotation sensor and the ordinary tiltmeter agree well in the 15-to 60-mhz frequency range . above that , the angle measured by the tiltmeter is dominated by acceleration , which the rotation sensor rejects efficiently . fig .",
    "[ msc ] shows the mean - squared coherence of the two data sets as a function of frequency .",
    "subtracting the two datasets gives a factor of 2 to 3 suppression of rotation noise in the rotation sensor in the 15-to 60-mhz range .",
    "the small @xmath18 of the rotation sensor balance implies that the microseismic acceleration affecting the tiltmeter in fig .",
    "[ msc ] near @xmath64 hz would produce an angle noise of less than 10 picorad/@xmath63 .",
    "this is confirmed by the coherence plot which shows poor coherence at the microseismic frequencies .",
    "however , the residual noise after subtraction is worse compared to the noise from the quiet - condition data .",
    "we believe this excess noise arises from high - frequency vibration , discussed in the next section . during quiet conditions at night , when background rotations were much smaller , the two instruments showed reduced correlation , indicating that at least one instrument was limited by intrinsic noise .        .",
    "there are various environmental influences that can produce noise in the rotation sensor . due to the low - pass filtering of torques by the balance and the nature of background influences ( such as weather ) ,",
    "the noise requirement at 10 mhz is most challenging .",
    "other than the autocollimator noise , all other noise sources are practically insignificant above 50 mhz .",
    "comparison of the lowest torque noise measured with and without the rubber shims placed under the feet of the support platform , demonstrating the suppression of the torque noise . ]    one of the largest noise sources we had to overcome was what we referred to as vibration noise .",
    "the spectral shape of the noise was white ( in torque ) , but it had a daily amplitude variation of a factor of @xmath65 , correlated with ambient vibration levels .",
    "there are several models which could explain this kind of noise .",
    "one possible explanation is that this noise is a result of irregular torques arising from fluctuations of the parameters of the flexure ( parametric down - conversion ) triggered by excessive high - frequency vibrations .",
    "regardless of the exact mechanism for the process , we found that placing small rubber shims under the feet of the large aluminum platform to which the rotation sensor was bolted reduced this vibration noise ( fig .",
    "[ daily ] ) .",
    "the white - noise floor was lowered by a factor of 10 with the introduction of the rubber shims .",
    "still , this may remain the current limiting noise source and might be worse in places with large vibrations .",
    "we plan to investigate and reduce this noise source further .",
    "an important noise source is the presence of a temperature gradient between the two arms of the balance .",
    "this armlength effect was analyzed by speake _",
    "et al . _ @xcite using their formulation and a measured upper limit on the temperature gradient , we estimated the upper limit of the angle noise from this effect to be less than @xmath66 rad@xmath0 at 10 mhz .",
