    "development of general relativity ( gr ) and quantum field theory ( qft ) leads to the increasing interest to study the role of gravitational field in elementary particle physics . to obtain and study the properties of regular localized solutions to the nonlinear classical field equations",
    "is motivated mainly by a hope to create a consistent , divergence - free theory . these solutions , as was remarked by rajaraman  @xcite give us one of the ways of modeling elementary particles as extended objects with complicated spatial structure .",
    "in such attempts it is natural to treat the field nonlinearity not only as a tool for avoiding the theoretical difficulties ( such as singularities ) but also as a reflection of real properties of physical system .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the complete description of elementary particles with all their physical characteristics ( e.g. , magnetic momentum ) can be given only in the framework of interacting field theory  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present some regular particle - like solutions within the scope of general relativity for an interacting system of scalar and electromagnetic fields , confining ourselves to static , spherically and/or cylindrically symmetric configurations .",
    "we consider a system with the lagrangian @xmath2 where the first term describes the einstein gravitational field ( @xmath3 is the scalar curvature , @xmath4 is the gravitational constant ) and @xmath5 is some arbitrary function characterizing interaction between the scalar @xmath6 and electromagnetic @xmath7 fields .",
    "this kind of interaction has been thoroughly discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the nongravitational part of the lagrangian (  [ lag ] ) describes a system with a positive - definite energy if and only if @xmath8 .",
    "let us write the scalar and the electromagnetic field equations corresponding to the lagrangian (  [ lag ] ) @xmath9 @xmath10 the corresponding energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath11 \\label{emt}\\ ] ]",
    "as an external homogenous and isotropic gravitational field we choose the frw space - time .",
    "this universe is very important as the corresponding cosmological models coincides with observation .",
    "the interval in the frw universe in general takes the form  @xcite @xmath12   \\label{met}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 defines the size of the universe , and @xmath14 takes the values @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the simple most case putting @xmath17 constant , which corresponds to the static frw universe . in static case",
    "@xmath18 corresponds to usual minkowski space , @xmath19 describes the close einstein universe @xcite and @xmath20 corresponds to the space - time with hyperbolic spatial cross - section .",
    "note that the velocity of light @xmath21 has been taken to be unity .    as was mentioned earlier , we seek the static , spherically symmetric solutions to the equations (  [ scl ] ) and (  [ em ] ) . to this end",
    "we assume that the scalar field is the function of @xmath22 only , i.e. @xmath23 and the electromagnetic field possesses only one component @xmath24 .    under the assumption made above , the solution to the equation (  [ em ] ) reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the constant of integration and @xmath27 putting (  [ emf ] ) into (  [ scl ] ) for the scalar field we obtain the equation with `` induced nonlinearity ''  @xcite @xmath28 this equation can be written in the form @xmath29 with the first integral @xmath30 where we substitute @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the constant of integration , which under the regularity condition of @xmath33 at the center turns to be trivial , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "finally we write the solution to the scalar field equation in quadrature @xmath35 in accordance with (  [ emf ] ) and (  [ int1 ] ) from (  [ emt ] ) we find the density of field energy of the system @xmath36 and total energy of the material field system @xmath37 thus , we see that the energy density @xmath33 and total energy @xmath38 of the configurations obtained do not depend on the conventional values of the parameter @xmath14 . as one sees , to write the scalar @xmath6 and vector @xmath39 functions as well as the energy density @xmath40 and energy of the material fields @xmath41 explicitly",
    ", one has to give @xmath42 in explicit form . here",
    "we will give a detailed analysis for some concrete forms of @xmath42 .",
    "let us choose @xmath42 in the form @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the interaction parameter .",
    "inserting  ( [ cos ] ) into (  [ fe ] ) we get the sin - gordon type equation  @xcite @xmath45 with the solution @xmath46 , \\quad b = { { \\lambda q \\sqrt{p_0}}\\over{r } } , \\quad z_1 = { \\rm const }   \\label{ssg}\\ ] ] let us analyze the solution (  [ ssg ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath47 for all @xmath14 .",
    "as one sees , the solution possesses meaning only in the region where @xmath48 .",
    "it means , in case of @xmath49 the configuration confines in the interval @xmath50 .",
    "then the asymptotic behavior of the solution (  [ ssg ] ) can be written as @xmath51 from (  [ toten ] ) we find the total energy of the system @xmath52 . for the choice of @xmath42 in the form @xmath53 with @xmath44 being the coupling constant and @xmath54 being some arbitrary constant , from (  [ fe ] ) we obtain @xmath55 the equation ( [ mkdv ] ) can be seen as an mkdv one .",
    "indeed , a kdv equation @xmath56 can always be converted to @xmath57 if one looks for stationary solution of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 . in our particular case @xmath60 and",
    "the equation ( [ mkdv ] ) is an mkdv one .",
    "the scalar field function in this case has the form @xmath61 , \\quad b = { { 2q}\\over{r } } \\label{th}\\ ] ] taking into account that @xmath62 one sees that at the origin @xmath63 whereas at the asymptotic region for different value of @xmath14 we get @xmath64 from (  [ toten ] ) we find the total energy of the system to be @xmath65 .",
    "a specific type of solution to the nonlinear field equations in flat space - time was obtained in a series of interesting articles  @xcite .",
    "these solutions are known as droplet - like solutions or simply droplets .",
    "the distinguishing property of these solutions is the availability of some sharp boundary defining the space domain in which the material field happens to be located , i.e. , the field is zero beyond this area .",
    "it was found that the solutions mentioned exist in field theory with specific interactions that can be considered as an effective one , generated by initial interactions of unknown origin .",
    "in contrast to the widely known soliton - like solutions , with field functions and energy density asymptotically tending to zero at spatial infinity , the solutions in question vanish at a finite distance from the center of the system ( in the case of spherical symmetry ) or from the axis ( in the case of cylindrical symmetry ) .",
    "thus , there exists a sphere or cylinder with critical radius @xmath66 outside of which the fields disappear .",
    "therefore the field configurations have a droplet - like structure  @xcite .    to obtain the droplet - like configuration",
    "we choose a very specific type of interaction function @xmath67 which has the form  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 . putting (  [ p ] ) into (  [ qua ] ) for @xmath70 one",
    "gets @xmath71^{\\sigma/2 } \\label{drop}\\ ] ] recalling that @xmath72 from (  [ drop ] ) we see that at @xmath73 the scalar field @xmath70 takes the value @xmath74 and at @xmath75 , the scalar field function becomes trivial , i.e. , @xmath76 it is obvious that for @xmath77 the value of the square bracket turns out to be negative and @xmath78 becomes imaginary , since @xmath79 is an odd number .",
    "since we are interested in real @xmath70 only , without loss of generality we may assume the value of @xmath70 to be zero for @xmath80 , the matching at @xmath81 ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) being smooth .",
    "note that , for @xmath19 , the scalar field is confined in the region @xmath50 , as it was in previous two cases .",
    "the total energy of the droplet we obtain from (  [ toten ] ) has the form @xmath83 as is seen from (  [ te ] ) , the value of the total energy does not depend on the size of the droplet , it means droplets of different linear size share the same total energy .      to study the stability of the configurations obtained we write the linearized equations for the radial perturbations of scalar field assuming that @xmath84 putting (  [ per ] ) into (  [ scl ] ) in view of (  [ sfd ] ) we get the equation for @xmath85 @xmath86 the second term in (  [ efp ] ) is zero since we assume the frw space - time to be static one putting @xmath87 constant .",
    "assuming that @xmath88 from (  [ efp ] ) we obtain @xmath89 v = 0 \\label{efv}\\ ] ] the substitution @xmath90 leads the equation (  [ efv ] ) to the liouville one  @xcite @xmath91 for the interaction term (  [ cos ] ) we see that @xmath92 thus we find that the equations with trigonometric nonlinearity contain stable solutions .",
    "given @xmath93 in the form (  [ kdv ] ) we find that @xmath94 as is seen from (  [ kdvstab ] ) the equations with polynomial type of nonlinearity too contain some stable solutions . for the droplet - like configurations , i.e. , for the interacting term @xmath42 given by (  [ p ] ) , it can be shown that the potential @xmath95 beginning with @xmath96 .",
    "it means that the droplet - like configurations (  [ drop ] ) with @xmath96 are stable for the class of perturbation , vanishing at @xmath97 and @xmath81 .",
    "in the previous section we studied the possibility of formation of regular localized configuration in homogenous and isotropic frw universe .",
    "let us now continue our study in the homogenous but anisotropic universe .",
    "in particular we consider the model proposed by g@xmath0del .",
    "the linear element of g@xmath0del universe in cylindrical coordinates reads  @xcite @xmath98 d \\phi^2 -{{\\sqrt{8}}\\over{\\omega } } { \\rm sinh}^2 \\omega \\rho d\\phi dt - dz^2 \\label{gmet}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath99 is related with the angular velocity @xmath100 : @xmath101 .",
    "this form of linear element of the four - dimensional homogenous space @xmath102 directly exhibits its rotational symmetry , since the @xmath103 do not depend on @xmath104 .",
    "it is easy to find @xmath105 i.e. at @xmath106 g@xmath0del universe transfers to the flat one .    as in spherically symmetric case , here",
    "too we seek the static solutions to the equations (  [ scl ] ) and (  [ em ] ) assuming the scalar field to be the function of @xmath107 only , i.e. , @xmath108 and the electromagnetic possesses only one component @xmath109 . for the electromagnetic field in this case",

    "finally we write the solution to the scalar field equation in quadrature @xmath117 in accordance with (  [ eg ] ) and (  [ int2 ] ) from (  [ emt ] ) we find the density of field energy and the total energy of the system @xmath118 as in the previous case , to write the scalar @xmath6 and vector @xmath39 functions as well as the energy density @xmath40 and energy of the material fields @xmath41 explicitly , one has to give @xmath42 in explicit form . here again we will thoroughly study the solutions obtained for different concrete forms of @xmath42 . choosing @xmath42 in the form (  [ cos ] ) , i.e. , @xmath119 with @xmath44 being the interaction parameter , from (  [ sfeg ] ) we get the sin - gordon type equation @xmath120 the solution to this equation can be written in the form @xmath121 , \\quad \\alpha = \\lambda q \\sqrt{p_0 } \\label{ssg1}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the constant of integration , giving the size of the system . without losing the generality we can choose @xmath123",

    "the choice of the interaction term @xmath42 in the form (  [ p ] ) , i.e. , @xmath134 where @xmath135 , leads to the following expression for scalar field @xmath136^{\\sigma/2 } , \\quad \\alpha = \\pm { { 4 \\lambda q}\\over{\\sigma } } \\label{dropg}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is an arbitrary constant . for @xmath123",
    "the solution possesses physical meaning at @xmath137 and becomes meaningless at @xmath138 .",
    "outside the cylinder @xmath139 one can put @xmath140 .",
    "this trivial solution is stitched with the solution at @xmath141 under condition @xmath142 , which fulfills if and only if @xmath143 .",
    "consequently , at @xmath138 the lagrangian becomes physically meaningless , however its limiting value at @xmath144 is equal to zero .",
    "continuing it at @xmath138 , one can consider the field be totally trivial in this area .",
    "thus we get the droplet - like configuration .",
