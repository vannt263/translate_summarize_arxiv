    "it is known that photo - induced voltage is generated in conducting thin film during the interaction of laser pulses and the simplest description for this observed voltage is that when structure is radiated by light , light can push electrons through lorentz force due to its electric and magnetic fields . the force on electrons can be detected as a voltage in the structure . in simple cases ,",
    "this force can be estimated using momentum conservation , that is , momentum from photons transfers to the free carriers of the material and this effect manifests itself as a pulsed voltage .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated by other groups in various materials and explained in terms of optical rectification and photon drag effect .    in systems without inversion symmetry ,",
