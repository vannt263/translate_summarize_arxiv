    "supercuspidal representations of reductive @xmath0-adic groups were discovered by f.  mautner in the late 1950s .",
    "in fact , one of us ( sally ) heard him lecture on his discovery at brandeis in 1959 .",
    "his construction is contained in the following theorem , which appeared in the _ american journal of mathematics _ in 1964 .",
    "the notation is explicated in the body of the paper .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a @xmath0-adic field and @xmath5 its ring of integers , and write @xmath6 let @xmath7 be an irreducible , unitary representation of @xmath8 whose restriction to @xmath9 does not contain the trivial representation .",
    "let @xmath10 be the induced representation ( compact induction ) .",
    "then @xmath11 is the direct sum of a finite number of irreducible , unitary representations @xmath12 of @xmath13 . in a suitable orthonormal basis , the matrix coefficients of each @xmath12 are functions of compact support on @xmath13 .    in 1963 , i.  m.  gelfand and m.  i.  graev published a paper in _ uspekhi _ @xcite in which they studied the representation theory of @xmath0-adic @xmath1 .",
    "their methods and presentation hewed closely to those used in the study of the discrete series of real @xmath1 , and did not make use of induction from compact , open subgroups .",
    "their realization of the discrete series can be directly compared to the representation constructed by a.  weil @xcite , as shown by s. tanaka in @xcite .",
    "gelfand and graev presented formulas for the discrete - series characters @xcite*5.3 , 5.4 and recovered the plancherel formula (  6.2 ) , but they made some errors concerning irreducibility of the discrete series and unitary equivalence .    in his thesis @xcite*1.51.9 ,",
    "j.  a.  shalika constructed the supercuspidal representations of @xmath0-adic @xmath1 by using the weil representation .",
    "he then proved their irreducibility and identified the equivalences among them in complete detail .",
    "in addition , he showed (   3 , 4 ) that each supercuspidal representation could be induced from a maximal compact subgroup by restricting , picking out an irreducible component , and inducing back up .",
    "the existence of a frobenius - type inducing formula for supercuspidal characters was shown by t.  shintani @xcite*theorem 3 , who worked with a group of square matrices over a @xmath0-adic field whose determinant is a unit in the ring of integers . in 1968 , sally and shalika used such a formula ( see @xcite*theorem 1.9 ) to compute the irreducible characters of the supercuspidal representations of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "their formulas have a sign error in a few cases , but their later papers @xcite are not affected .",
    "see remark [ rem : far ] for details .",
    "there were several additional expositions related to the discrete - series characters of rank - one groups over a @xmath0-adic field .",
    "* a.  silberger @xcite computed characters for @xmath14 by a type of limit formula ; * h.  jacquet and r.  p.  langlands @xcite used the information from sally  shalika to analyze supercuspidal characters for @xmath15 ; * h.  shimizu @xcite published some character computations for @xmath15 ; and * sally gave an example of the inducing construction for @xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a complete guide for computing the supercuspidal characters of @xmath1 over a @xmath0-adic field . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : history ] , these characters have been available in some form at least since the 1960s  @xcite . over the intervening half - century , significant advances have been made in our understanding of both reductive @xmath0-adic groups and their representation theory . a goal of this paper is to bring these modern , general tools to bear on the problem of explicit character computation .",
    "the formulas in @xcite were found by using @xcite*theorem 3.1.2 to recognize the supercuspidal representations of @xmath16 as induced ( in the sense of  3.1 ) from ( finite - dimensional ) representations of maximal compact subgroups of @xmath13 , and then employing a @xmath0-adic analogue of the frobenius formula @xcite*theorem  1.9 . broadly speaking",
    ", this paper follows the same path . after establishing some basic notation (   [ sec : sqrt][sec : dualityfour ] ) , we discuss how to construct all supercuspidal representations of @xmath13 (   [ sec : ktypes][sec : inducing ] ) , and then finish by computing the characters of these representations (   [ sec : mk][sec : exceptional ] ) .",
    "we begin by establishing some basic facts and notation about fields (  [ sec : sqrt ] ) and tori (  [ sec : tori ] ) .",
    "after examining a certain principal - value integral that will appear in the character formulas (  [ sec : ssphi ] ) , we discuss in  [ sec : building ] the pioneering work of bruhat  tits @xcite and moy ",
    "tits theory underlies nearly everything that we do ; indeed , without it , we would not have the language in which to state many of our results . in order not to require of the reader familiarity with the general notions of bruhat ",
    "tits theory , we specialize them to @xmath1 , where the group filtrations can be described very concretely ( see  [ sec : filt ] ) , and related to filtrations of tori ( see  [ sec : gp - torus ] ) and , via the cayley map , of the lie algebra ( see  [ sec : cayley ] ) .",
    "the cayley map has many of the properties of the exponential map ( see lemma [ lem : cayley ] ) , but can converge on a larger domain .    after summarizing our choices for normalization of measures (  [ sec : measure])we will usually use waldspurger s normalization , adapted to the structure theory of bruhat  tits and moy  prasad  and discussing the fourier transform (  [ sec : dualityfour ] ) , we turn our attention to the problem of classifying all supercuspidal representations of @xmath13 .",
    "we do this via the theory of types , reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : ktypes ] .",
    "an unrefined minimal @xmath8-type is a certain pair @xmath17 consisting of a compact , open subgroup @xmath8 and a representation @xmath18 of it .",
    "every irreducible representation of a @xmath0-adic group contains an unrefined minimal @xmath8-type , unique up to a natural relation ( see definition [ defn : k - type ] ) .    for @xmath1 ,",
    "the unrefined minimal @xmath8-type contained in a representation is sufficient to determine whether that representation is supercuspidal ; we list all those that can occur in a supercuspidal representation .",
    "the final task is to determine from a given unrefined minimal @xmath8-type _ all _ possible supercuspidal representations that contain it . for depth - zero ,",
    "unrefined minimal @xmath8-types , the above plan is carried out in  [ sec : depthzero ] ; and for positive depth representations it is carried out in  [ sec : posdepth ] .",
    "the calculations of  @xcite were long , involved , and , since the state of the art in structure theory of @xmath0-adic groups then ( 1968 ) was not nearly so advanced as it is now , somewhat _ ad hoc _ ; and , perhaps most importantly , they have never appeared in print . in the final sections of this paper ,",
    "we justify the calculations of @xcite , making use of modern technology whenever it simplifies matters .",
    "two particularly powerful references that are available to us are @xcite , which handles all but four of the depth - zero , supercuspidal representations ; and @xcite , which handles all positive - depth supercuspidal representations .",
    "the remaining four supercuspidals , which we call ` exceptional ' ( see  [ sec : exceptional ] ) , require a bit more care ; but , even in this case , most of the necessary work has already been done , by waldspurger @xcite and debacker  kazhdan @xcite , and there remains only the ( non - trivial ! ) task of specializing this work to the case of @xmath1 . see  [ sec : characters ] for a summary of the results .    in future work @xcite",
    ", the present authors , together with alan roche , will continue this program to present a complete picture of harmonic analysis on @xmath0-adic @xmath1 .",
    "one of our goals will be to make more accessible some of the general tools that have been developed over the last fifteen years by specializing them to the case of @xmath1 . thus , rather than citing major theorems ( such as the bernstein decomposition theorem , or the main theorems of moy ",
    "prasad ) , we will prove them in this case wherever doing so has illustrative value .",
    "we will construct all irreducible representations and compute their characters .",
    "we will treat the principal series in an old - fashioned way , via intertwining operators , and also via the theory of types .",
    "we will construct the unitary , smooth , and tempered duals , and describe the discrete series .",
    "we will compute the fourier transforms of nilpotent orbital integrals on the lie algebra , descibe the local character expansions of all irreducible representations , and compute the plancherel measure .",
    "if @xmath19 is a ring , then we denote by the group of units in @xmath19 .",
    "suppose that is a non - discrete , non - archimedean local field with normalized valuation ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) .",
    "let denote the ring of integers in @xmath4 and the prime ideal of @xmath5 .",
    "fix an element @xmath21 and a uniformizer @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the residue field @xmath24 of @xmath4 .",
    "then the image in @xmath25 of @xmath26 is a non - square in @xmath25 .",
    "we write @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and assume throughout that @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 is an ( additive ) character of @xmath4 and @xmath31 , then write @xmath32 for the additive character given by @xmath33 . if @xmath30 is non - trivial , then the @xmath34 of @xmath30 is the smallest index @xmath35 such that @xmath30 is trivial on @xmath36 .",
    "( if @xmath30 _ is _ trivial , then we may define @xmath37 . )",
    "note that , for @xmath30 an ( additive ) character of @xmath4 and @xmath31 , we have @xmath38    we fix , for the remainder of the paper , an additive character @xmath30 of depth @xmath39 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath30 is trivial on @xmath40 , but not on @xmath5 .",
    "we will use boldface letters to denote algebraic groups , boldface fraktur letters to denote their lie algebras , and the corresponding regular letters to denote their groups of rational points .",
    "for example , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    put @xmath43 . thus , by our convention , @xmath44 is the subgroup of all determinant - one matrices in the group @xmath45 of invertible @xmath46 matrices , and @xmath47 is the subalgebra of trace - zero matrices in the the lie algebra @xmath48 of @xmath46 matrices over @xmath4 .",
    "when we are dealing with complicated exponents , we will sometimes write instead of @xmath49 , for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "as mentioned , our calculations use rather general results in @xmath0-adic harmonic analysis , which , in most cases , have been proven only subject to some restrictions .",
    "we discuss those restrictions now .",
    "since    * is split , hence tame ; * , which is its own derived group , is simply connected ; and * the only bad prime for @xmath1 ( in the sense of @xcite * definition ) is @xmath52 ,    we have by @xcite * remark that all the hypotheses of  hold",
    ". we shall demonstrate explicitly that @xcite * hypothesis holds ; see notations [ notn : depth-0-x ] and [ notn : pos - depth - x ] .",
    "the next hypothesis is only needed when we cite @xcite*lemma 12.4.3 ( our lemma [ lem : mk - green ] ) , i.e. , in the depth - zero cases of proposition [ prop : mk ] and theorems [ thm : near ] and [ thm : exc - near ] . although it is possible to remove this restriction in our setting , we have not done so here .",
    "[ hyp : debacker - reeder : depth - zero - sc : res-12.4.1(2 ) ] the characteristic of @xmath4 is @xmath39 , and the residual characteristic satisfies @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the absolute ramification degree of @xmath4 ( i.e. , its ramification degree over @xmath55 ) .      in this section ,",
    "we summarize the character values computed in this paper . the formulas which occur use a large amount of notation that has not been defined yet ; it is described in detail in ",
    " [ sec : tori][sec : dualityfour ] .",
    "we adopt the parametrization of supercuspidal representations presented in theorem  [ thm : sc ] . by remarks [ rem : depth-0-leftist ] and [ rem : pos - depth - leftist ] ,",
    "we may , and do , restrict our attention to tori of the form @xmath56 for some @xmath57 .    as described in @xcite , computations of characters of @xmath0-adic groups",
    "have indicated that , broadly speaking , they have a ` geometric part ' near the identity , where they are described in terms of functions associated to ( co)adjoint orbits @xcite , and an ` arithmetic part ' far from the identity , where they are described by some analogue of weyl s classical character formula .",
    "( actually , @xcite * theorem shows that one should usually expect _ mixed _ arithmetic  geometric behavior , even for supercuspidal characters ; but there is a clean separation in the case of @xmath1 . ) to make precise the notion of being near or far from the identity , we use moy  prasad s notion of depth ; see definitions [ defn : depth - element ] and [ defn : depth - rep ] .",
    "specifically , the geometric part of the character of a representation @xmath58 applies to those elements @xmath59 such that @xmath60 , whereas the arithmetic part applies to those elements @xmath59 such that @xmath61 . in the intermediate range , where @xmath62 , the character exhibits qualitatively different behavior , related to special functions on @xmath0-adic and finite fields ( see @xcite* ) .",
    "we call this range the ` bad shell ' ; the terminology ` shell ' comes from the fact that the depth is the analogue of the valuation on a @xmath0-adic field , so that the set of elements of fixed depth may be thought of as an analogue of the set difference of two @xmath0-adic balls .",
    "all of the available quantitative information about supercuspidal characters comes from the evaluation of harish - chandra s integral formula .",
    "the integral here is taken over the full group @xmath13 , which is far too large to handle directly ; so the main focus in evaluating it is on finding many sub - integrals that equal @xmath39 .",
    "the remaining terms can then often be related to calculations on a finite field , or a finite group of lie type .",
    "few details of this part of the character computation are included in the present paper ; we refer instead to @xcite , whose general results we take for granted .",
    "the challenge is to interpret these general results as explicitly as possible for the special case of @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite * proposition defines a crucial ingredient in the weyl - sum - type formula that gives the arithmetic part of a supercuspidal character ; it is a fourth root of unity called a _ gauss sum _ ( see  ) .",
    "the explicit formula of proposition describes this fourth root of unity in terms of the galois action on ( absolute ) roots .",
    "the most technically demanding part of our positive - depth character computations is probably the specialization of this explicit description to our setting ; see  [ sec : roots ] . with this in place , we compute the order of a certain coset space , which turns out to be a weyl discriminant ( see lemma [ lem : disc - as - index ] ) , to complete our explicit description of the arithmetic part of an ` ordinary ' ( positive - depth ) supercuspidal character , in the sense of definition [ defn : pos - depth - param ] .    from the point of view of this paper , the geometric part of the character is a combination of fourier transforms of semisimple orbital integrals ; this is murnaghan s version of kirillov theory ( see  [ sec : mk ] ) . in the ` ordinary ' case ( see definitions [ defn : depth-0-param ] and [ defn : pos - depth - param ] ) , there is only one orbital integral involved ; but , in the ` exceptional ' case , the situation is more complicated .",
    "see . thus , once we have identified the coefficients occurring in the combination ( in particular , the formal degree ; see lemma [ lem : deg - pi ] ) , we recall the results of @xcite*theorem on semisimple orbital integrals to complete the explicit description of the geometric part of the character formula .",
    "we summarize all this below ; but , for the sake of brevity , we take some shortcuts . in this section",
    ", the letter @xmath59 always stands for a regular , semisimple element of @xmath13 .",
    "that is , @xmath59 is always a noncentral semisimple element of @xmath13 .",
    "second , when we write , for example , @xmath63 we are really giving the character value on any @xmath13-conjugate of an element of @xmath64 . in this way , we describe the characters ` shell by shell ' .",
    "further , since the central character of @xmath65 or @xmath66 is @xmath67 , we have that @xmath68 for all @xmath59 and all @xmath69 , and similarly for @xmath70 .",
    "that is , the formula above really gives the character value on any @xmath13-conjugate of an element of @xmath71 .",
