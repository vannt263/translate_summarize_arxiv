    "as remarked in @xcite , despite the fact that quantum field theories are usually formulated in coordinate space , calculations , in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 cases , are almost always performed in momentum space . however , when we are faced with the exact calculation of correlation functions we are naturally led to the problem of finding closed - form expressions for green functions in coordinate space @xcite .    a closed - form representation for the thermal green function of the free massless scalar field",
    "is called a _ scalar _ field , in contrast to a _ vector _ or _ tensor _",
    "field , when under a lorentz transformation @xmath6 , it transforms , trivially , according to @xmath7 .",
    "the quantization of such fields gives rise to spin-0 particles ( _ scalar bosons _ ) , like the famous higgs boson ( a proposed elementary particle in the standard model of particle physics ) .",
    "however , it is a well - known fact that most particles in the universe have a nonzero intrinsic spin .",
    "these particles arise in field theory when we consider fields which transform non - trivially under lorentz transformations .",
    "indeed , fields with spin have more complicated transformation laws , since the various components of the fields rotate into one another under lorentz transformations .",
    "a good example of such a field is the vector field @xmath8 of electromagnetism , which transforms as @xmath9 . in field theory ,",
    "spin-1 particles are described as the quanta of vector fields .",
    "such _ vector bosons _ play a central role as the mediators of interactions ( _ force carriers _ ) in particle physics .",
    "another good example comes from the dirac equation , whose quantization gives rise to spin-1/2 particles ( _ fermions _ ) .",
    "+ last but not least , we must stress that , for each kind of field , we may conceive field theories describing massive and massless particles . for instance , in the case of vector ( spin-1 ) fields , we may cite as important examples the gauge fields of the electromagnetic , the weak , and the strong interactions , whose corresponding vector bosons are , respectively , massless photons , massive @xmath10 and @xmath11 bosons , and massless gluons .",
    "] in 2d was firstly presented in @xcite , where attention has been focused on its relation with the bosonization of the massive thirring model ( mtm ) , where @xmath12 is a two - component dirac fermion field in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions , and @xmath13 are dirac gamma matrices .",
    "notice that the interaction is the only local interaction possible since the model involves only four fermion variables .",
    "it is well known that it can be mapped , by a method called bosonization , into the sine - gordon model of a scalar field , whose dynamics is determined by @xmath14 , where the couplings in the two models are related as @xmath15 ; @xmath16 .",
    "both models have been extensively studied . ] using the imaginary - time formalism for finite temperature quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the authors omit valuable details of the calculations , which would be useful for graduate students and researchers working on this subject .    in the present work we present a simple and yet appealing step - by - step derivation of an exact closed - form representation for the thermal green function of 2d free massless scalar theory in the coordinate space , at a level accessible to usual graduate students in physics .",
    "this has been obtained by using the imaginary - time formalism along with methods of integration on the complex plane and the software _",
    "mathematica_. the peculiar form of this , allows us to easily recognize it as the real part of an analytic function , a fact that leads us to determine the corresponding dual thermal green function as the imaginary part of that function , according to the cauchy - riemann conditions .",
    "this dual thermal green function turns out to be a key ingredient for the obtainment of fermion correlators of the mtm at finite temperature , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the euclidean thermal green function of the 2d free massless scalar theory can be written in the coordinate space ( @xmath17 ) as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 . at @xmath4",
    ", @xmath21 reduces to the 2d coulomb potential .    the sum appearing in ( [ gft1 ] )",
    "may be evaluated by considering the following integral on the complex plane @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and the integration contour @xmath24 is defined in fig .",
    "[ contour]-(a ) .",
    "the function @xmath25 has poles at @xmath26 , being therefore outside the contour @xmath24 .",
    "those of @xmath27 , are situated at @xmath28 , ( @xmath29 ) hence inside the contour @xmath24 .",
    "it is easy to see , using the residue theorem @xcite that the sum coincides with the integral @xmath30 and , therefore , we have    @xmath31 \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-i\\omega_n\\tau}}{k^2+\\omega_n^2}. \\end{split } \\label{gft5}\\ ] ]    deforming the contour @xmath24 into @xmath32 shown in fig .",

    "finally , notice that the eq .",
    "( [ gft20nova ] ) may be also written as @xmath52 , \\label{gft20}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 @xmath54",
    "from eq . ( [ gft20 ] ) we can also see that the thermal green function may be written as the real part of an analytic function of a complex variable @xmath55 , namely @xmath56=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\mathcal{f}(\\zeta)+\\mathcal{f}^*(\\zeta)\\right ] , \\label{gft20b}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 $ ] .",

    "we would like to make a few comments about ( [ gft20 ] ) .",
    "firstly , we note that in the zero temperature limit ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 and , therefore , we recover the well - known green function at zero temperature , namely @xmath66=-\\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\ln \\left[\\mu_0 ^ 2 ||{\\bf{r}}||^2 \\right ] . \\label{gft22}\\ ] ]    comparing ( [ gft20 ] ) with ( [ gft22 ] ) we can also see that the only effect of introducing a finite temperature is to exchange the complex variable @xmath67 for @xmath68 . since @xmath68 is analytic , we conclude that the thermal green function is obtained from the one at zero temperature by the following conformal mapping @xcite : the infinite strip @xmath1 and @xmath0 is mapped into the region within the upper - half-@xmath55-plane .",
    "notice that only the values @xmath69 $ ] of @xmath3 are relevant because this variable is periodic in @xmath70 , as it should at finite @xmath71 .",
