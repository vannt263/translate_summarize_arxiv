    "nonuniform magnetic structures , including exchange bias ( ferromagnet / antiferromagnet)@xcite and exchange - spring ( ferromagnet / ferromagnet)@xcite systems , have recently been explored extensively on account of their intrinsic advantages for applications in both permanent magnets and recording media .",
    "exchange - spring ( es ) magnets are systems of exchanged - coupled hard and soft magnetic layers that behave as a single magnet . here , the high saturation magnetization ( _ m@xmath5 _ ) of the soft phase and the high anisotropy ( _ h@xmath6 _ ) of the hard phase result in a large increase in the maximum energy product .",
    "this makes them useful as permanent magnets in energy applications such as engines or generators in miniaturized devices . on the other hand , for spintronic applications",
    ", the soft phase is used to improve the writability of the magnetic media , which in turn is stabilized by the magnetic configuration of the hard layer .",
    "consequently , a wealth of research has been devoted to investigating the static and dynamic magnetic properties , including the switching behavior and exchange coupling strength , in es systems .",
    "+ in case of es systems with tilted anisotropy , the hard and soft phases consist of materials with out - of - plane ( oop ) and in - plane ( ip ) anisotropies , respectively . this combination results in a canting of the magnetization of the soft layer with a wide and tunable range of tilt angles .",
    "the advantage of such a hybrid anisotropy system is that it is neither plagued by the poor writability and thermal instability of systems with ip anisotropy , nor does it lead to very high switching fields , as in oop systems . as a result ,",
    "these materials provide additional degrees of freedom to control the magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures , and hint at potential applications in novel spintronic devices utilizing the spin - transfer torque ( stt ) effect  such as spin - torque oscillators ( stos)@xcite and stt - mrams .",
    "+ so far , numerous studies have been performed on such systems where the exchange coupling between the hard and soft layers has been tailored by varying the layer thickness,@xcite layer composition,@xcite number of repeats,@xcite and interfacial anisotropy.@xcite the literature describes investigations of domain structure and other static magnetic properties for [ co / pd]/co,@xcite [ co / pd]/nife,@xcite [ co / pd]/cofeb,@xcite [ co / pd]-co - pd - nife,@xcite [ co / ni]/nife,@xcite and cocrpt - ni@xcite  these systems being studied with static magnetometry , magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) , and micromagnetic simulations .",
    "the magnetization dynamics in such systems have also been measured using brillouin light scattering ( bls)@xcite and ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr)@xcite experiments , where the spin - wave ( sw ) modes have been investigated by varying the thickness of the soft layer and changing the configuration of the hard layer . in any process involving magnetization dynamics , the gilbert damping constant ( _ @xmath7 _ ) plays a key role in optimizing writing speeds and controlling power consumption .",
    "for example , in case of stt - mram and magnonic devices , low _",
    "@xmath7 _ facilitates a lower writing current and the longer propagation of sws , whereas a higher _ @xmath7 _ is desirable for increasing the reversal rates and the coherent reversal of magnetic elements , which are required for data storage devices .",
    "+ in this paper , we present all - optical excitation and detection of magnetization dynamics in [ co(0.5 nm)/pd(1 nm)]@xmath0/nife(_t _ ) tilted anisotropy es systems , with varying soft layer thickness ( _ t _ ) , using a time - resolved magneto - optical kerr effect ( tr - moke ) magnetometer .",
    "the dynamical magnetic behavior of similar systems has previously been studied using bls@xcite and fmr@xcite measurements .",
    "however , a detailed study of the precessional magnetization dynamics and relaxation processes in such composite hard / soft systems is yet to be carried out .",
    "the advantage of implementing tr - moke is that here the magnetization dynamics can be measured on different time scales and the damping is measured directly in the time domain , and is therefore more reliable .",
    "we investigate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics over picosecond and picosecond time scales .",
    "the ultrafast demagnetization is examined and found to change due to the modified spin structure in the soft layer for different _ t _ values .",
    "the extracted sw spectra are strongly dependent on _ t_. an extensive study of the damping coefficient reveals that the extrinsic contribution to the damping is more dominant in the higher thickness regime , while intrinsic mechanisms govern the behavior at lower thicknesses .",
    "the samples were fabricated using dc magnetron sputtering and have the following structure : ta(5nm)/pd(3nm)/[co(0.5nm)/pd(1nm)]@xmath8 /ta(5 nm ) , where @xmath9@xmath10  nm . the chamber base pressure was below @xmath11  torr , while the ar work pressure was 2 and 5  mtorr for the ta , nife and co , pd layers , respectively .",
    "the samples were deposited at room temperature on naturally oxidized si(100 ) substrates .",
    "the 5  nm ta seed layer was used to induce fcc-(111 ) orientation in the pd layer , which improves the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the co / pd multilayers ; a ta cap layer was used to avoid oxidation , which has been reported in previous studies.@xcite the layer thicknesses are determined from the deposition time and calibrated deposition rates .      to investigate the precessional frequency and damping of these samples ,",
    "the magnetization dynamics were measured by using an all - optical time - resolved magneto - optical kerr effect ( tr - moke ) magnetometer@xcite based on a two - color optical pump - probe experiment .",
    "the measurement geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "the magnetization dynamics were excited by laser pulses of wavelength ( _ @xmath12 _ ) 400  nm ( pulse width = 100  fs , repetition rate = 80  mhz ) of about 16  mj/@xmath13 fluence and probed by laser pulses with _ @xmath12 _",

    "the pump and probe beams are focused using the same microscope objective with n.a .",
    "of 0.65 in a collinear geometry .",
    "the probe beam is tightly focused to a spot of about 800  nm on the sample surface and , as a result , the pump becomes slightly defocused in the same plane to a spot of about 1  @xmath14 m .",
    "the probe beam is carefully aligned at the centre of the pump beam with slightly larger spot size .",
    "hence , the dynamic response is probed from a homogeneously excited volume .",
    "the bias field was tilted at around  15  to the sample normal ( and its projection along the sample normal is referred to as _ h _ in this article ) in order to have a finite demagnetizing field along the direction of the pump beam .",
    "this field is eventually modified by the pump pulse which induces precessional magnetization dynamics in the samples .",
    "the kerr rotation of the probe beam , back - reflected from the sample surface , is measured by an optical bridge detector using phase sensitive detection techniques , as a function of the time - delay between the pump and probe beams .",

    "in order to closely observe the ultrafast demagnetization and fast remagnetization , we recorded the transient moke signals for delay times up to 30  ps at a resolution of 50  fs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d ) , the demagnetization times are plotted as a function of _",

    "t_. for _ t _ @xmath3 5  nm , the laser beam penetrates to the co / pd layer . in this regime ,",
    "the large spin - orbit coupling of pd enhances the spin - flip rate , resulting in a faster demagnetization process . as _",
    "t _ increases , the top nife layer is primarily probed . here",
    ", the spin configuration across the nife layer , which is further affected by the competition between the in - plane and the out - of - plane anisotropies of the nife and [ co / pd ] layers , governs the demagnetization process .",
    "qualitatively , ultrafast demagnetization can be understood by direct transfer of spin angular momentum between neighboring domains@xcite . which may be explained as follows : for _ t _ @xmath4 8  nm , the magnetization orientation in the nife layer varies over a wide range of angles across the film thickness , where the magnetization gradually rotates from nearly perpendicular at the co / pd and nife interface to nearly parallel to the surface plane in the topmost nife layer .",
    "such a spin structure across the nife layer thickness can be seen as a network of several magnetic sublayers , where the spin orientation in each sublayer deviates from that of the neighboring sublayer .",
    "this canted spin structure accelerates the spin - flip scattering between the neighboring sublayers and thus results in a shorter demagnetization time , similar to the work reported by vodungbo _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite on the other hand , for 5  nm @xmath3 _ t _ @xmath3 8  nm , the strong out - of - plane anisotropy of the co / pd layer forces the magnetization in the nife film towards the direction perpendicular to the surface plane , giving rise to a uniform spin structure .",
    "the strong coupling reduces the transfer rate of spin angular momentum and causes the demagnetization time to increase .",
    "+ to investigate the variation of the precessional dynamics with _ t _ , we further recorded the time - resolved data for a maximum duration of 2  ns at a resolution of 10  ps . figure  [ fig : fig2](a ) shows the background - subtracted time - resolved kerr rotation data for different values of _ t _ at _ h _ = 2.5  koe and the corresponding fast fourier transform ( fft ) power spectra .",
    "four distinct peaks are observed in the power spectrum of _ t _ = 20  nm , which reduces to two for _ t _ = 15  nm .",
    "this is probably due to the relative decrease in the nonuniformity of the magnetization across the nife thickness , which agrees with the variation in the demagnetization time , as described earlier . to confirm this , we simulated the static magnetic configurations of these samples in a field of @xmath15  koe using the llg micromagnetic simulator.@xcite simulations",
    "were performed by discretizing the samples in arrays of cuboidal cells with two - dimensional periodic boundary conditions applied within the sample plane .",

    "the evolution of @xmath7 as a function of _ t _ depends significantly on _ h _ , as can be seen from the figure .",

    "t _ and reaches a minimum value of about 0.014 for _ t _ = 7.5  nm . below this thickness , @xmath7 increases monotonically and reaches a value of about 0.022 for the lowest thickness .",
    "this variation of @xmath7 is somewhat correlated with the variation of precession frequency with thickness . in the thinner regime , we probe both the nife layer and a fraction of the co / pd multilayer and the relative contribution from the latter increases as _ t",
    "_ decreases . the occurrence of a single mode oscillation points towards a collective precession of the stack , which may be considered a medium with effective magnetic parameters consisting of both nife and co / pd layers .",
    "the variation in damping may be related to the variation in the anisotropy of the material .",
    "the competing ip and oop anisotropies of the nife and co / pd layers lead to the appearance of a minimum in the damping .",
    "the damping in this system may have multiple contributions , namely ( a ) dephasing of the uniform mode in the spin - twist structure@xcite ( b ) interfacial _",
    "d_-_d _ hybridization at the co / pd interface@xcite , and ( c ) spin pumping into the pd layer.@xcite the first is an extrinsic mechanism and is dominant in samples with higher nife thicknesses , while the other two mechanisms are intrinsic damping mechanisms .",
    "for _ t _ @xmath4 7.5  nm , due to the nonuniformity of the spin distribution , the dominant mode undergoes dynamic dephasing and the damping thus increasescompared to the magnetically uniform samples . with the increase in nife thickness , the nonuniformity of spin distribution and the consequent mode dephasing across its thickness increases , leading to an increase in the damping value .",
    "hence , in samples with higher _ t _ values , dephasing is the dominant mechanism , while at lower _",

    "t _ in a lower field of _ _",

    ", we have measured @xmath7 as a function of precession frequency _ f_. figures  [ fig : fig4](a)(b ) show the variation of @xmath7 with _ f_. two different regimes in the thickness are presented in ( a ) and ( b ) to show the rate of variation more clearly . for 10  nm @xmath26 _ t _ @xmath26 7  nm , @xmath7 decreases strongly with the decrease in _",
    "f _ and the rate of variation remains nearly constant with _",
    "t_. this is the signature of extrinsic damping generated by the nonuniform spin distribution .",
    "however , for _ t _ = 6.5  nm , the rate falls drastically and for _ t _",
    "5.5 nm , @xmath7 becomes nearly independent of _ t _ , which indicates that purely intrinsic damping is operating in this regime .",
    "this confirms the competition between two different types of damping mechanisms in these samples .",
    "the study demonstrates that various aspects of ultrafast magnetization dynamics  namely demagnetization time , precession frequency , number of modes , and damping  are influenced by the spin distribution in the soft magnetic layer , as well as by the properties of the hard layer . by changing the thickness of the soft layer",
    ", the relative contributions of these factors can be tuned effectively .",
    "this enables efficient control of the damping and other magnetic properties over a broad range , and will hence be very useful for potential applications in spintronic and magnonic devices .",
    "in summary , we have employed the time - resolved moke technique to measure the evolution of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in exchange - coupled [ co / pd]@xmath27/nife(_t _ ) multilayers , with varying nife layer thicknesses , by applying an out - of - plane bias magnetic field .",
    "the coupling of a high - anisotropy multilayer with a soft layer allows broad control over the spin structure , and consequently other dynamic magnetic properties which are strongly dependent on _ t_. the ultrafast demagnetization displayed a strong variation with _",
    "t_. the reason for this was ascribed to the chiral - spin - structure - dependent spin - flip scattering in the top nife layer , as well as to interfacial 3__d__-4__d _ _ hybridization of co / pd layer .",
    "the precessional dynamics showed multiple spin - wave modes for _ t _ = 20  nm and 15  nm , whereas a single spin - wave mode is observed for thinner nife layers following the change in the magnetization profile with decreasing _",
    "t_. the precession frequency and the damping show strong variation with the thickness of the nife layer .",
    "the changes in frequency are understood in terms of the modification of the anisotropy of the system , while the variation in damping originates from the competition between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms , which are somewhat related to the anisotropy .",
