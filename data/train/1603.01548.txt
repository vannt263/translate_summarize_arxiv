    "the yarkovsky  okeefe  radzievskii  paddack ( yorp ) effect alters the rotation rate of asteroids and the orientations of their rotation axes @xcite .",
    "the vector of the yorp torque has 3 components .",
    "the ` axial ' component of yorp @xmath0 accelerates or decelerates the asteroid s rotation , changing its angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the ` obliquity ' component @xmath2 turns the rotational axis , changing the obliquity @xmath3 .",
    "the third , ` precession ' component @xmath4 causes the precession of the asteroid s axis @xcite . for large asteroids",
    "this contribution is negligible compared to gravitational tides that also cause precession @xcite , however for 100-meter sized asteroids @xmath4 can already dominate over the tides .",
    "initial studies of yorp calculated the effect via integrating the torque over the surface of an asteroid and then averaging it over time @xcite , but later it was found more convenient for some applications to change the order of the procedures , first averaging the force acting on a surface element over time and only then integrating the force over the surface . @xcite used this approach in his approximate analytic consideration of yorp , and @xcite used it in their numeric simulations of asteroid 25143 itokawa .",
    "@xcite constructed in this manner an exact analytic theory for the axial component of yorp .",
    "they performed averaging over time in quadratures , and thus the yorp acceleration was expressed as an integral over the surface of an asteroid of an analytic function @xmath5 depending on only 2 free parametres , namely the latitude @xmath6 and the obliquity @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite limited their analysis to the axial component of yorp @xmath0 , but @xcite applied the same methods to get the obliquity component @xmath2 and the precession component @xmath4 .",
    "an important drawback of @xcite and @xcite was that both conducted their analysis under the assumption of zero thermal inertia of the surface .",
    "although this assumption makes no difference for the computation of @xmath0 , which is independent of thermal inertia at all , @xmath2 strongly depends on thermal inertia @xcite .    in this article",
    "we generalize these results for the case of non - zero thermal inertia . for a convex",
    "asteroid we express @xmath2 and @xmath4 as integrals over the asteroid s surface .",
    "two universal functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , participating in the integrals , incorporate all the necessary information about the thermal model of the asteroid .",
    "in contrast to the function @xmath5 , they depend on three parametres , thermal inertia of the surface @xmath9 being the third .",
    "we find functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 by numerically solving the heat conductivity equation .",
    "also we consider limiting cases of very large and very small thermal inertia of the surface , and develop approximate methods to get solutions in these cases analytically .",
    "the case of zero heat conductivity corresponds to rubincam s approximation .    in section [ sec : theory ] we introduce basic equations describing the yorp and yarkovsky effects .",
    "we determine the thermal model of the asteroid , derive general expressions for the yorp and yarkovsky forces created by a surface element , and ultimately define the overal yorp torque and the yarkovsky force as integrals over the surface of the asteroid .",
    "we express the yorp and yarkovsky forces as integrals of non - dimensionalized temperature , which is in turn to be determined from a partial differential equation with a non - linear boundary condition .",
    "we call these integrals @xmath10 with corresponding indices , as physically they mean differently averaged non - dimensionalized pressure .",
    "all these integrals @xmath10 appear to depend solely on three free parametres , and once parameterized , can be applied to any convex asteroid .",
    "then in section [ sec : analytic ] we propose three simple analytical models to estimate the expressions for @xmath10 derived in the previous section .",

( [ boundary_condition ] ) is unimportant , and the surface aquires the equillibrium temperature almost instantly , without any significant thermal lag . in the opposite case , if @xmath54 , the thermal lag is so large , that the surface temperature barely changes at all throughout a rotation period .",

    "the total recoil force @xmath61 experienced by each surface element consists of three parts : @xmath62 produced by the incident solar light , @xmath63 produced by solar light scattered by the surface , and @xmath64 produced by the infrared light emitted by the heated asteroid s surface .",
    "the first component , @xmath62 , is proved to produce no net yorp torque @xcite .",
    "so further on we disregard the direct solar light pressure @xmath62 .",
    "the expression for the second component depends on the scattering law used .",
    "the simplest and most widely used assumption is lambert s scattering law .",
    "it assumes no dependence on the direction of the incident light , and intensity of the emitted light proportional to cosine of the angle with the normal . under such assumptions , we get @xmath65 the coefficient 2/3 is caused by lambert s scattering indicatrix .",
    "the ultimate term , which acts on the surface element due to re - emission of infrared light , is @xmath66 we again assume lambert s indicatrix , which results in the same coefficient 2/3 .    to compute the yorp torque ,",
    "take the cross product of the radius - vector @xmath67 of the element @xmath35 with the recoil force @xmath68 .",
    "the radius - vector is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the angle between the radius - vector @xmath67 and the plane @xmath37 , and @xmath71 is the angle between projections of @xmath67 and @xmath15 onto the plane @xmath37 .",
    "thus the torque @xmath72 created by the recoil force acting upon the surface element @xmath35 , is given by the formula",

    "we must average @xmath72 over time . if spin and orbital periods are non - commensurate , this is equivalent to separate averaging over spin phase @xmath16 and orbital phase @xmath13 .",
    "this averaging is carried out in the next two subsections , first for the axial component @xmath74 , and then for the obliquity component @xmath75 and the precession component @xmath76 .",
    "such separation is convenient because of some essential simplifications , which can be done only for the axial component .",

    "( [ dt ] ) , we get @xmath78 it is crucial , that for the @xmath77-component of torque all terms with @xmath16 and @xmath13 cancel , so that @xmath74 depends on time only via the term in brackets .",

    "an important and robust by - product of our analysis is that the axial component of yorp does not depend on the thermal model of the surface , and is determined purely geometrically .",
    "this result is physically very sensible : for a big locally flat asteroid all energy obtained by a surface element is eventually emitted by the same surface element , and whatever the time lag for this emission is the lever arm around the rotation axis stays the same , thus the mean axial torque depends solely on the mean absorbed power .",
    "this does not hold for the obliquity component of yorp , whose lever arm alters during rotation period of the asteroid , thus the time lag between absorption aand re - emission matters .",
    "the fact that the axial component of yorp is independent of the thermal model was first spotted in numerical simulations by @xcite , although the authors were hesitant to acknowledge generality of their result .",
    "later this result was proved theoretically by @xcite in a simplified model of yorp with a constant thermal lag , by @xcite in a linearized heat conductivity model , and by @xcite via fourier decomposition of heat conductivity equation .",
    "although the latter proof is already general enough , we find our proof more straightforward . here",
    "we have proved axial yorp independence of the thermal model only for a convex asteroid and lambert s scattering law . a more general proof of this fact is given in appendix [ sec : t_z independense ] .",

    "a similar method can be used to get the diurnal component of the yarkovsky force created by the surface element .",
    "the force produced by the incident solar light @xmath62 gives no contribution to the yarkovsky force , as the impinging solar photons carry momentum in the radial direction only , and thus can not change the angular momentum of the asteroid with respect to the sun .",

    "now we shall examine these assumptions and discuss their impact on the applicability of our results .",
    "calculation of incoming energy for each surface element is based on the assumption of the asteroid to be convex .",
    "concave shape leads to two complications : shadowing and self - heating .",
    "however if the asteroid is only moderately concave , shadowing occurs only for rays with glancing angle of incidence , which anyway contribute little energy per unit area due to small projection onto the normal .",
    "self - heating for such asteroid can be even less important because in this case glancing angles of incidence mean not only small projection onto the normal , but also small emitted intensity in lambert s law . thus we expect that proposed formalism , although developed under the assumption of a convex shape , will also work reasonably well for moderately concave asteroids .    to test this assumption",
    ", we are using a ray tracing program , which calculates the yorp acceleration experienced by non - convex asteroids .",
    "the program randomly casts rays on the surface of the asteroid , allowing for each of them to be randomly scattered with the directions distributed in accordance with lambert s law , tests if it is absorbed by another surface element after the scattering , and if so , it is scattered again , and so on .",
    "the program computes the angular momentum conveyed to the asteroid by the rays .",
    "it assumes instant re - emission of each ray , and thus works in rubincam s approximation .",
    "we do not separate light into visible and infrared , but assume that lambert s law describes both scattering and re - emission , so we just trace a ray of constant energy , and only frequency distribution of energy changes in the ray after scattering / re - emission events .",
    "plots of the axial component of yorp computed by the program for radar models of three asteroids are shown in figure [ ray tracing ] .",
    "results of the computation using eqn .",
    "( [ t_z_int ] ) are shown for comparison .",
    "we see that moderately non - convex 4179 toutatis demonstrates a very good agreement between eqn .",
    "( [ t_z_int ] ) and the ray tracing program . even for strongly non - convex contact binary 216",
    "kleopatra the two computations at least qualitatively agree with each other . and only for extremely non - conxex 6489 golevka",
    "the two curves completely differ .",
    "all other shapes we tested ( 1620 geographos , 2063 bacchus , 1998 ky26 ) demonstrate good agreement between the two curves , similar to the case with toutatis .",
    "thus we conclude , that although eqs .",
    "( [ t_z_int])([f_yark_int ] ) were derived under the assumption of convex shape , for most real shapes of asteroids they also work reasonably well .",
    "our simulations are similar to the ones performed by @xcite .",
    "we see a perfect agreement of the shapes of both our analytic and ray tracing plots for 4179 toutatis and 6489 golevka with the corresponding plots in figure 7 in @xcite , although the normalization of the plots is different .",
    "our program assumes instant re - emission of the absorbed light , and thus relies on the assumption that rubincam s approximation can be used for precize calculation of the axial component of yorp .",
    "although we have proved this theorem only for convex asteroids , it can be also generalized for the case of concave asteroids .",
    "a proof of this theorem under very general assumptions is given in appendix [ sec : t_z independense ] .      throughout the article we assumed the orbit to be circular .",
    "if the orbit is elliptical , the solar energy flux @xmath43 decreases with the increase of heloicentric distance @xmath171 .",
    "the angular speed of orbital motion @xmath172 also decreases with the increase of @xmath171 . in rubincam",
    "s approximation these two factors depending on @xmath171 cancel out , and ellipticity of the orbit only results in a prefactor depending on eccentricity being added to all equations ( see appendix [ sec : elliptic ] for detail ) .    beyond rubincam",
    "s approximation the effect of eccentricity is more substantial .",
    "still most of our analytic and numerical results can be easily modified to account for eccentricity .",
    "the exact modifications needed are described in appendix [ sec : elliptic ] .",
    "equations do not become much more complicated , but the number of free parameters increases from 3 to 5 , making the result more difficult to analyze and parameterize .",
    "we assumed lambert s law for scattered and emitted light .",
    "if lambert s law does not hold true for emitted light , but its indicatrix is still independent on the incidence angle , it causes only a minor correction to our theory . indeed , assume we have some emission indicatrix @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the angle of the emitted ray with the normal to the surface .",
    "then the recoil pressure created by the emitted light is @xmath175 , with the coefficient @xmath176 given by the formula @xmath177 for lambert s scattering law @xmath178 we have @xmath179 , which we used in eqn .",
    "( [ f_vis ] ) .",
    "a different indicatrix will result into coefficient @xmath180 being substituted for the new @xmath176 in eqn .",
    "( [ f_vis ] ) and all the consequent equations for the force and torque generated by emitted light .",
    "if scattered light is symmetric with respect to the normal , the same consideration also works for it .",
    "however most scattering laws assume that the intensity of scattered light depends not only on the angle @xmath174 , but also on the direction of the incident light .",
    "the same happens if beaming is taken into account for the emitted light @xcite .",
    "the corresponding general theory is developed in appendix [ sec : non - lambertian ] and applied to lommel ",
    "seeliger law .",
    "mathematically such general theory is not much more complicated than the lambertian case , but the formulae are lenghtier and harder to grasp .",
    "our analysis also shows that corrections due to lommel ",
    "seeliger law do not substantially change the results .",
    "therefore lambert s law for scattered light provides a useful basic approximation .",
    "this agrees with analyzis by @xcite , who integrated the torque over the surface of the asteroid and also found that for lommel ",
    "seeliger reflection the yorp effect is not very different from the standard lambertian calculations .",
    "( [ conductiv ] ) and ( [ boundary_condition ] ) assume that heat conductivity is 1-dimensional and occures in an infinite semispace under the surface .",
    "these assumptions break if the asteroid is small enough for heat fluxes to propagate from one side of the asteroid to the other .",
    "this case has been extensively studied by @xcite .",
    "another important case when heat conductivity may no longer be considered as occuring in 1-dimensional semispace is the case of rough surface , e.g. stones lying on the surface of an asteroid .",
    "this case analyzed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite leads to a concept of tangential yorp , which appears due to asymmetric emission of light by symmetric stones and manifests itself in a tangential drag force acting on the surface .",
    "thus results of this article are applicable only to larger asteroids ( at least tens of metres ) with relatively smooth surface .",
    "the main results of this article can be split in three parts .",
    "firstly , we propose a unified theory for the yorp and yarkovsky effects , expressing torques and forces experienced by an asteroid as integrals over its surface .",
    "these integrals include functions , which must be obtained from solutions of heat conductivity equation .",
    "although these can not be expressed analytically , they depend only on three free parameters , and once parameterized can be used to calculate the yorp torque and the yarkovsky force experienced by any asteroid .",
    "this approach is a generalization of results by @xcite and @xcite , which were obtained under the assumption of zero heat conductivity .",
    "secondly , we introduce approximate methods to express these functions in quadratures for the cases of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . despite that we only use these approximations to estimate the yorp and yarkovsky effects ,",
    "they can be applied to a much broader range of problems connected with thermal models of asteroidal and planetary surfaces .",
    "thirdly , we examine the area of applicability of standard treatment of the yorp effect .",
    "we find that moderately concave asteroids still may be safely simulated with our convex model for yorp .",
    "our model can be generalized for the case of non - lambertian scattering laws , but the results are very similar to the ones obtained for lambert s scattering .",
    "elliptical orbits can also be easily incorporated into our general formalizm .",
    "the independence of the axial component of yorp on the thermal model appears to be very robust , and holds for concave asteroids and non - lambertian scattering laws .",
    "this result allows simulating yorp acceleration in rubincam s approximation .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous reviewer , who very much contributed to improving the article .",
    "in subsection [ sec : axial ] we have demonstrated that the axial component of yorp @xmath0 is independent of the thermal model . although we restricted our proof to convex asteroids only",
    ", it appears that this result does not depend on the convexity of the asteroid and can be proved under much broader assumptions .",
    "concavity of the asteroid s shape adds more complications to the proof of applicability of rubincam s approximation , but it still appears to hold as long as scattering indicatrix remains independent of the wavelength and emission indicatrix stays independent of the temperature . denoting power coming from surface element @xmath181 to surface element @xmath182 at wavelength @xmath183 via @xmath184 , we have @xmath185 here @xmath186 corresponds to the power emitted by element @xmath181 at wavelength @xmath183 due to heat radiation , and @xmath187 is the power coming directly from the sun to element @xmath181 at wavelength @xmath183 .",
    "coefficients @xmath188 here describe the emission indicatrix , whereas coefficients @xmath189 and @xmath190 the scattering indicatrix . the first term in the right hand side of eqn .",

    "coefficients @xmath193 and @xmath194 are assumed to be independent of wavelength .",

    "averaging , eqn .",

    "( [ non - convex4 ] ) corresponds to a set of linear equations , which defines functions @xmath198 , independently of the thermal model .",
    "this leads to eqn .",
    "( [ non - convex3 ] ) implying the mean emitted powers @xmath199 to be independent of thermal model .",
    "therefore the recoil pressures and the yorp effect created by this emission are also constant .",
    "( the latter conclusion also relies on the emission indicatrix being independent of the wavelength . )",
    "both assumptions of scattering and emission indicatrices being independent of wavelength are essential for the axial component of yorp to stay independent of the thermal model . if either of these assumptions breaks down , eqn .",
    "( [ non - convex1 ] ) no longer leads to eqn .",
    "( [ non - convex2 ] ) , and the heat model enters the yorp effect computations via the wavelength at which heat emission will predominantly occur .",
    "[ sec : elliptic ]    if the orbit is elliptical with eccentricity @xmath200 , we get two important complications in the calculation of yorp .",
    "firstly , the insolation @xmath43 is not constant anymore , but depends on the heliocentric distance @xmath171 as @xmath201 where @xmath202 is solar constant ( solar radiation flux at 1 au ) , and @xmath171 is measured in astronomic units .",
    "secondly , angular speed of the asteroid on the orbit varies , so that orbit average is no longer equal to average over orbital phase @xmath13 : time @xmath203 stands in the same proportion to the area of orbit segment @xmath204 covered with the elapse of this time , as the orbital period @xmath205 stands to the total area of the orbit @xmath206 . from this proportion",
    "we obtain @xmath207    in rubincam s approximation all our integrals are proportional to @xmath208 , thus factors @xmath209 cancel , and all our analysis for circular orbits is valid , if only @xmath43 is substituted with the combination @xmath210    to go beyond rubincam s approximation we need to modify our equations more substancially .",
    "first of all , we need the dependence of @xmath171 on @xmath13 , which for elliptic orbit is @xmath211 where @xmath1 is argument of perihelion of the asteroid in its own equatorial coordinate frame , i.e. the angle between the asteroid s spring equinox and its perihelion .",
    "we go through the entire derivation again , and end up with the same expressions as before , but with the following substitutions : @xmath212 definitions of @xmath103 and @xmath9 must be also slightly changed by substituting @xmath213 instead of @xmath43 in eqs .",
    "( [ tau ] ) and ( [ theta ] ) .    similarly to section [ sec : analytic ] we get expressions for rubincam s approximation , low and high thermal inertia limits . analogously to section [ sec : numeric ] we can simulate eqs .",
    "( [ tau ] ) and ( [ theta ] ) with @xmath44 modified numerically , and then numerically average it with the modified @xmath214 .    for @xmath80 and @xmath96 additional factors in eqs .",
    "( [ alpha1 ] ) and ( [ upsilon1 ] ) cancel , and the impact of ellipticity is reduced to alteration of @xmath43 according to eqn .",
    "( [ phi_elliptic ] ) .    for @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    "the impact of ellipticity is more profound .",

    "( [ boundary_condition ] ) , and eqn .",
    "( [ upsilon1 ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ p_t_sin_def ] ) and ( [ p_t_cos_def ] ) , thus obtaining corrected expressions for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "such @xmath99 and @xmath100 are plotted in figure [ figelliptic ] .",
    "they depend not only on @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 , but also on @xmath215 and @xmath1 .",
    "additional free parameters make these formulae for elliptical orbits harder to paremeterize , and thus less useful .",
    "still , these formulae provide us with the quantitative estimate of impact of ellipticity of the orbit on the results obtained for circular orbits .",
    "interestingly , for eccentric orbits @xmath216 ( left ) and @xmath217 can be non - zero even for @xmath156 .",
    "this behavior agrees with @xcite , who predicted non - zero obliquity component of yorp for @xmath156 and @xmath218 , and called it _",
    "seasonal yorp effect in attitude _ by analogy with the seasonal yarkovsky effect in orbital motion .",
    "still our analysis proves the analogy relatively weak : the seasonal yarkovsky effect is caused by seasonal temperature waves , while the seasonal yorp effect in attitude appears in our model with periodic initial conditions , which exclude seasonal temperature waves .",
    "thus the simplest possible explanation is that in nonlinear heat conductivity model the mean thermal re - emission lag is smaller for higher temperatures , so that the torques experienced by the asteroid in different points of its orbit do not compensate each other .",
    "although the seasonal temperature variations are in turn caused by seasonal temperature waves .",
    "throughout this paper we assumed lambert s law to govern scattering of light by the surface of the asteroid . in this appendix",
    "we shall get rid of this assumption and generalize our treatment for any scattering indicatrix .",
    "let us assume an arbitrary scattering law for visible light , @xmath219 here @xmath220 is the brightness of the surface , i.e. energy flux sent by a unit surface element into a unit solid angle .",
    "the angle @xmath181 between the incident light ray and the normal to the surface can be found from eqn .",
    "( [ sn ] ) by substituting @xmath221 ( see figure [ fig9 ] ) . also , @xmath174 represents the angle between the emitted light ray and the normal to the surface , @xmath44 is the angle between the projections of the incident and the scattered light rays onto the surface of the asteroid , and @xmath43 is the incident radiation flux .",
    "the function @xmath222 determines the scattering law .",
    "let us supplement vector @xmath223 @xmath224 @xmath225 to an orthogonal basis with vectors @xmath226 and @xmath227 , directed in the plane of the surface , northward and westward respectively .",
    "then the recoil force can be expressed in terms of these three basis vectors as follows , @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the `` azimuth of the sun '' , i.e. the angle between the north direction @xmath230 and the projection of @xmath14 onto the horizontal plane , measured counterclockwise .",
    "it can be determined from the equations @xmath231",
    "@xmath232    for isotropic surfaces @xmath233 .",
    "thus , if we consider two time instances of the same day , one of which is as close to dawn as the other is to setting ( @xmath234 , @xmath235 ) , and two rays emitted at these instances so that @xmath236 , @xmath237 , we see that the term proportional to @xmath238 cancels itself after time averaging .",
