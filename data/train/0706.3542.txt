    "ferromagnetism and spin - singlet superconductivity are competing orders because the exchange potential breaks down spin - singlet pairs .",
    "spin - singlet pairs , however , do not always disappear under the influence of an exchange potential .",
    "long time ago fulde - ferrell  @xcite and larkin - ovchinnikov  @xcite discussed inhomogeneous spin - singlet superconductivity in the presence of an exchange potential .",
    "it was shown that the superconducting order parameter oscillates in real space because the exchange potential shifts the center - of - mass momentum of a cooper pair .",
    "similarly , a cooper pair has been discussed in superconductor / ferromagnet ( sf ) and superconductor / ferromagnet / superconductor ( sfs ) junctions  @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that a pairing function in a ferromagnet changes its sign periodically in real space .",
    "as a consequence , sfs junctions may undergo so - called 0-@xmath0 transition with varying length of a ferromagnet or temperature .",
    "previous theoretical studies of the proximity effect in a ferromagnet were mainly based on solving the quasiclassical usadel equations  @xcite valid when the exchange potential @xmath1 is comparable to or smaller than the pair potential in a superconductor at zero temperature @xmath2 .",
    "cooper pairs can penetrate into a ferromagnet within a short distance @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the diffusion constant in a ferromagnet . thus , penetration of spin - singlet cooper pairs into a ferromagnet with large @xmath1 would be impossible and the josephson coupling via such a strong ferromagnet would be vanishingly small .",
    "a recent experiment  @xcite , however , demonstrated the existence of josephson coupling through a strong ferromagnet with @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to this , the experiment  @xcite has even shown josephson coupling in superconductor /half metal / superconductor ( s / hm / s ) junctions .",
    "a half metal is an extreme case of a completely spin polarized material because its electronic structure is insulating for one spin direction and metallic for the other .",
    "thus one has to seek a new state of cooper pairs in a strong ferromagnet .",
    "the experiment by keizer et .",
    "al . has motivated a number of theoretical studies in this direction  @xcite .",
    "prior to the experiment  @xcite , eschrig _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite have addressed this challenging issue . in the _ clean limit _ , they have shown that @xmath6-wave spin - triplet pairs induced by spin - flip scattering at a junction interface can carry josephson current . in practical",
    "s / hm / s junctions , however , a half metal is close to the _ dirty limit _ in the diffusive transport regime ; the elastic mean free path @xmath7 may be smaller or comparable to the coherence length and is much smaller than the size of the half metal @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the effects of the impurity potential on the josephson current should be clarified in a sfs junction consisting of a strong ferromagnet . in this paper , we discuss the josephson effect in sfs junctions for arbitrary magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath2 , an ensemble average of the josephson current is much smaller than its mesoscopic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the pairing function in a ferromagnet is responsible for the large fluctuations of josephson current .",
    "the josephson current vanishes in s / hm / s in the absence of spin - flip scattering at junction interfaces .",
    "spin - flip scattering at junction interfaces drastically changes the characteristic behavior of josephson current and properties of cooper pairs in a ferromagnet .",
    "spin - flip scattering allows for the penetration of equal - spin - triplet cooper pairs which have unusual symmetry property called odd - frequency symmetry  @xcite .",
    "when the contribution of equal - spin - triplet cooper pairs to the josephson current is dominant , the self - averaging property of the josephson current is recovered .",
    "in particular in diffusive s / hm / s junctions , all cooper pairs in a half metal are in the odd - frequency equal - spin - triplet pairing state  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss local density of states in a ferromagnet which reflects the existence of odd - frequency cooper pairs . a part of this study has been already published elsewhere  @xcite . throughout this paper ,",
