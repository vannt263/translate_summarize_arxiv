    "decoherence in particular is of relevance for quantum technologies trying to make use of the vast computational potential forecast to applied quantum information processing @xcite .    in the regime of weak system - environment coupling and short environmental correlation times",
    "the dynamics of an open quantum system may be described in terms of the born - markov approximation .",
    "the corresponding markov master equation then has a generator in lindblad form @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the system depends on its present state only .",
    "often , however , such an approximation is not justified .",
    "then , memory effects  often incorporated by means of integrals over the past @xcite  start to play an essential role .",
    "yet , it is known that for arbitrary bath correlation functions approximate and sometimes even exact time - local master equations can be derived @xcite .",
    "an important example is given by the exact master equation for a damped harmonic oscillator bilinearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite . here , we focus on a dephasing qubit as an open quantum system using the standard harmonic oscillator environment , whose exact time local master equation is known .    in more recent developments , the question of how to define and distinguish `` markovian '' from `` non - markovian '' dynamics from a local ( system ) perspective was addressed .",
    "the analysis has been based both on a single snapshot of the dynamics @xcite and on the full time evolution of the open quantum system within a certain time interval @xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "memory effects associated with non - markovian dynamics are expected to cause temporary increase in the distinguishability of states ( in terms of trace distance , e.g. @xcite ) and the dynamics may no longer be divisible  @xcite . under markovian dynamics , on the other hand",
    ", the decay of distinguishability will be monotonic throughout and divisibility will be ensured .    in this context",
    "the `` flow of quantum information '' from system to environment and back is an often employed , and certainly intuitive picture .",
    "however , without a proper conceptual and theoretical framework , such a picture should be used with caution .",
    "care has also to be taken with respect to the need for a proper ( quantum ) environment .",
    "it should be noted that for single - qubit decoherence the dynamics may always be described in terms of _ stochastic _ fluctuations of _ external fields _ , i.e. , the dynamics has a random unitary representation  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics may thus be modeled _ without _ invoking a quantum environment at all .",
    "higher dimensions then two are needed to see decoherence that can only be understood in terms of a proper quantum environment @xcite .    the role and nature of _ system - environment correlations _ in open quantum system dynamics has raised some notable interest lately . in the context of quantum discord @xcite ,",
    "for example , total states with no quantum correlation ( zero discord ) were shown to be the most general class of initial states allowing for completely positive ( cp ) reduced dynamics @xcite . another interesting line are investigations about the relation between decoherence and system - environment entanglement . here , it is possible that the system essentially decoheres completely _ without _ becoming entangled with its environment at all @xcite .",
    "such cases show that classical system - environment correlations alone may account for a vast number of phenomena related to `` open quantum systems '' . as we will also see in this paper , often an exchange of _ quantum _ information between system and environment can not be proven .    in order to shed light on the nature of system - environment correlations in open system dynamics in a non - trivial ( non - lindblad ) regime , and the possible relation to recent definitions of `` non - markovianity '' we here investigate single - qubit dephasing due to the coupling to an oscillator environment @xcite .",
    "in so doing , we favour to investigate the dynamics and `` quantumness '' of system - environment correlations thus avoiding the study of the somewhat vague notion of ( quantum ) `` information flow '' in open quantum system dynamics .    the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we will present our model and give an exact , useful expression for the total system - environment state .",
    "section [ sec : rand - unit - models ] will be concerned with the derivation of a random unitary representation for the reduced qubit state at time @xmath0 , showing that from the system perspective alone , no quantum environment is necessary to model the dynamics .",
    "the two inherently different approaches in sections  [ sec2 ] and  [ sec : rand - unit - models ] are exact and thus describe decoherence in the markovian as well as the non - markovian regime . accounting for non - markovianity , in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we concentrate on a super - ohmic spectral density which ensures an at times negative dephasing rate . in section  [ sec5 ]",

    "following earlier work  @xcite , in section  [ sec6 ] we finally investigate the nature of these correlations .",
    "we find that for most qubit initial states there is no relation between `` non - markovianity '' and the build - up or decay of _ quantum _ correlations .",
    "furthermore , even if there are time intervals where the total state of system and environment is entangled , there is no obvious relation to the periods of `` non - markovianity '' .",

    "indeed , on the level of the reduced state , single - qubit decoherence ( and indeed , all single - qubit unital cp maps ) can always be modelled in this way  @xcite .",

    "it is also worth noting that random unitary dynamics emerging from an open quantum system with environmental initial pure state can always be `` undone''(quantum error correction ) @xcite .    the most straightforward random unitary realization of single - qubit decoherence with state ( [ equ : solution - roh_red ] ) at time @xmath0",

    "( [ equ : two_time_map ] ) to be cp .",
    "the random unitary form ( [ dephasing_process ] ) of the dephasing map @xmath60 is simple but has the drawback of not representing an intuitive dynamical picture of the process due to the time dependence of the probabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 . here , we want to develop an alternative random unitary representation in a more systematic way that opens the door for further generalizations as explained below .",
    "recall that pure dephasing of an open quantum system in the basis @xmath63 implies a controlled - unitary form @xmath64 of the total propagator @xcite . here , @xmath65 with @xmath66 are system - state - dependent propagators for the environment ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "we close this section by pointing out an interesting additional observation : the random unitary representation ( [ random_unitary_2 ] ) for the quantum dephasing model is _ not _ restricted to single - qubit - dephasing .",
    "in fact , for an arbitrary system hilbert space dimension , the very same construction works for all dephasing factors @xmath93 $ ] of a quantum oscillator environment model .",
    "so even for larger hilbert space dimension than two  on a local level  pure dephasing based on a quantum oscillator model like ( [ opensystemmodel ] ) _ can not _ be distinguished from random unitary dynamics . for genuine quantum decoherence",
