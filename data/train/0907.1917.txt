    "accurately determining the absolute value of the neutrino mass is one of the main goals of particle physics .",
    "however since the effect of individual neutrinos is small it is cosmological observations , that observe the cumulative effect of neutrinos on large scales , that present the most powerful way to bound the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "albeit indirect and model dependent , cosmological constraints are currently stronger than those coming from beta - decay experiments ( for recent reviews see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite tritium decay experiments give upper limits on the single electron neutrino mass of @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , at @xmath4c.l .. cosmological data coming from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements from wmap @xcite experiment combined with baryonic oscillation data @xcite and various supernovae observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) lower this limit to @xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand observations of flavour oscillations in atmospheric and solar neutrinos",
    "provide evidence not only for a non - zero neutrino mass , but also for a difference between masses , measuring squared mass differences of @xcite : @xmath6 where ranges indicated are @xmath7 confidence level and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the three mass eigenstates .",
    "the ambiguity in the sign of @xmath11 leads to an uncertainty about the neutrino mass scheme , allowing for two possible hierarchies : the _ normal _ hierarchy , given by the scheme @xmath12 , or the _ inverted _ hierarchy @xmath13 .",
    "note that given equation ( @xmath14 ) an inverted hierarchy scenario would be automatically excluded by measuring a total mass @xmath15 .",
    "it is commonly perceived that cosmology is able to constrain the total neutrino mass @xmath16 while mass differences between eigenstates can be neglected .",
    "this is an excellent approximation as shown in @xcite at least for the cmb anisotropies power spectrum , since the effect of neutrino mass on the cmb is related to the physical density of massive neutrinos @xmath17 , i.e. to their total mass @xmath16 .",
    "individual neutrino masses do have an effect on the matter power spectrum , due to the different transition redshifts from relativistic to non - relativistic behaviour .",
    "this effect is still much smaller than that due to the total mass and can be safely neglected in analysing current cosmological data . nevertheless in the near future various experiments",
    "will reach a much higher accuracy in reconstructing the matter power spectrum .",
    "it is therefore timely to consider the possibility that these surveys will be sensitive to single neutrino masses . in recent papers",
    "( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) a forecast has been made considering future observations of cmb anisotropies , cmb lensing and galaxy distribution finding that this kind of data does nt seem able to reach enough accuracy to discriminate between the two hierarchies . in @xcite has been shown that future accurate measurements of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization can in principle measure individual masses but will be very difficult to achieve the precision required to distinguish normal and inverted hierarchies .    in @xcite",
    "an explicit and more general parameterization of neutrino mass splitting was introduced , representing various possible hierarchies ; with the only simplifying approximation that two neutrinos are of the same mass @xmath18 .",
    "this approximation is well justified by equation ( [ sqmd ] ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that even a cosmic variance limited cmb experiment would not be able to detect a difference in individual neutrino masses .",
    "in addition cmb lensing , even if limited by cosmic variance only , is strongly inhibited in measuring the mass hierarchy by degeneracies with other cosmological parameters .    in this article",
    "we use a fisher matrix formalism applied to the same parameterization of @xcite to assess the ability of future cosmic shear measurements , like those achievable with euclid / dune @xcite experiment , combined with planck @xcite cmb data to place constraints on single neutrino masses .",
    "it is almost a decade that cosmic shear has been recognized as one of the most powerful tools to constrain the total neutrino mass ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and@xcite ) and hence an investigation into how far these experiments can proceed in the exploration of the neutrino properties is well justified .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ effects ] we review in more detail the effects of the total neutrino mass and of individual neutrino masses on cosmological observables .",
    "we also describe the parameterization of @xcite which will be used throughout the rest of the article . in section [ forecast ]",
    "we describe the implementaton of our cosmic shear and cmb fisher matrices .",
    "section [ results ] shows results from our forecasts as function of various assumptions about the neutrino mass hierarchy , and for different parameter sets .",
    "we also discuss results in the light of our parameterization of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "our forecasts show that accurate measurements of the matter power spectrum from euclid , combined with cmb data from planck , can reach the accuracy required to constrain single neutrino masses . in section [ bayes ]",
    "we conduct a more accurate analysis of our results through a bayesian evidence investigation .",
    "we also show that assuming a wrong hierarchy can lead to a bias in the recovered value of other cosmological parameters , in particular for the dark energy equation of state , generally comparable with the @xmath19 sensitivity .",
    "the largest bias is found in the total neutrino mass , due to the degeneracy involving @xmath16 and the hierarchy parameter , at @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our conlusions .",
    "the main effect of a non - zero neutrino mass on cosmology is through the collisionless fluid behaviour that causes neutrinos to free - stream over a typical length which is known as _ free - streaming length _ @xmath20 .",
    "the consequence of this free propagation is a cancellation of neutrino density fluctuations on scales smaller than @xmath20 and a slow - down in the growth of perturbation on these scales .",
    "the matter power spectrum results are then damped for wave vectors @xmath21 .",
    "the free streaming wave vector of a single species @xmath22 depends on the mass of that species ( @xcite ) @xmath23}}{(1+z)^{2}}\\left(\\frac{m}{1{\\rm ev}}\\right)hmpc^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 . on these small scales",
    "the matter power spectrum is suppressed with respect to the power spectrum of a cosmology with massless neutrinos by an amount that depends mainly on the fraction @xmath25 of matter density in the form of massive neutrinos ( @xmath26 ) . in the case of degenerate masses",
    "@xmath27 can be expressed as a function of the total neutrino mass:@xmath28 however , as pointed out in @xcite , even in the case of non - degenerate masses this relation remains a good approximation .",
    "massive neutrinos become non - relativistic at a redshift given by @xmath29 , so that neutrinos with masses up to @xmath30 are still relativistic at time of recombination . as a result the effect of neutrino free streaming on the cmb power spectrum is negligible for small neutrino masses . in this case",
    "the main effect of neutrino masses on the cmb is indirect , related to the delay of matter - radiation equality .",
    "this causes a small shift in the peaks of the power spectrum and a slight increase of their heights due to a longer duration of the sachs - wolfe effect .    from this discussion",
    "is clear that neutrino mass affects growth of structure in two ways : the matter power spectrum is suppressed by an amount that depends mainly on the total mass @xmath16 but also , even if for a minor amount , on single masses , because the time of transition to non - relativistic regime depends on single masses .",
    "the typical wave vector over which this suppression can be observed also depends on the mass of single neutrino species as shown by equation ( [ kfs ] ) .",
    "therefore a reconstruction of the matter power spectrum can in principle give information both on @xmath16 and on single masses ( through the suppression of the power spectrum and @xmath22 ) , even if this second effect is generally much smaller than that due to the total mass . in the following sections we investigate the ability of future cosmological experiments to reach the sensitivity required to detect differences in neutrino masses .",
    "following @xcite we parameterize mass splitting by introducing the parameter @xmath31 defined as the fraction of the total mass in the third neutrino mass eigenstate : @xmath32 the other two eigenstates are assumed to share the same mass @xmath18 .",
    "this approximation is supported by the observed differences in the squares of neutrino masses as measured by oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this parameterization is that it allows us to represent in a simple way various mass hierarchies such as total degeneracy ( @xmath34 ) and normal or inverted hierarchy given respectively by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "weak lensing ( see @xcite for a recent review or http://www.gravitationallensing.net ) is a particularly powerful probe of cosmology since it simultaneously measures the growth of structure through the matter power spectrum , and the geometry of the universe through the lensing effect . since weak lensing probes the dark matter power spectrum directly it is not limited by assumptions about galaxy bias ( how galaxies are clustered with respect to the dark matter ) .",
    "future weak lensing surveys will measure photometric redshifts of billions of galaxies allowing the possibility of 3d weak lensing analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) or a tomographic reconstruction of growth of structures as a function of time through a binning of the redshift distribution of galaxies @xmath37 , with a considerable gain of cosmological information ( e.g. on neutrinos @xcite ; dark energy @xcite ; the growth of structure @xcite and map the dark matter distribution as a function of redshift @xcite ) .    in this section we present forecasts for the upcoming weak lensing survey euclid @xcite , combined with constraints expected from the cmb planck experiment @xcite using a fisher matrix formalism .",
    "we first explored a simple @xmath38-parameter model with fiducial values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the hierarchy parameter @xmath46 .",
    "note that we are assuming a fiducial normal hierarchy scheme for neutrino masses .",
    "we then repeated the analysis for a larger set of parameters , including running of spectral index ( with target value @xmath47 ) and the dark energy equation of state @xmath48 ( assuming cosmological constant @xmath49 as the fiducial model ) , to study how degeneracies with various parameters affect constraints on neutrino mass hierarchy .    to calculate the power spectra we used the numerical code camb @xcite that can calculate cmb and matter power spectra , also for non - degenerate neutrino masses .",
    "the usual definition of the fisher matrix @xcite is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the likelihood function for a set of parameters @xmath52 .",
    "when the derivatives of ( [ fisher ] ) are evaluated at the fiducial model the fisher matrix gives an estimate of the best statistical error achievable on the parameters ( via the cramer - rao inequality ) for the method and survey design considerd @xmath53 the fisher matrix for weak lensing is given by ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the convergence weak lensing power spectrum that depends on the non - linear matter power spectrum at redshift @xmath56 , @xmath57 , obtained by correcting the linear matter power spectrum @xmath58 using the option @xmath59 of camb @xcite .",
    "@xmath60 is the step used for @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the last expression @xmath63 is the rms intrinsic galaxy ellipticity ( and we assume @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 is the number of galaxies per steradian belonging to @xmath66 bin @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of galaxies per square arcminute and @xmath69 is the fraction of sources belonging to the @xmath66 bin .",
    "for the euclid experiment we take @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the galaxy redshift distribution is assumed to have the form @xmath72 $ ] with @xmath73 .",
    "for this experiment photometric redshift uncertainties are assumed to be @xmath74 .",
    "we treat this uncertainty following the approach of @xcite where a galaxy with redshift @xmath56 could be wrongly observed at a redshift @xmath75 . letting @xmath76 be the probability that this happens the distribution of galaxies in the @xmath77 bin is modified to take into account this ` leakage ' between bins @xmath78 .",
    "we choose a simple gaussian form for @xmath76 @xmath79.\\ ] ]    the fisher matrix for weak lensing is then added to that of cmb to obtain constraints from the combination planck@xmath80euclid @xmath81 for a cmb experiment the fisher matrix is given by @xcite : @xmath82 where the couples @xmath83 and @xmath84 mean in our case @xmath85 , @xmath86 or @xmath87 ( temperature and e - mode polarisation ) .",
    "@xmath88 is the power spectrum covariance matrix at the @xmath89 multipole and @xmath90 is the maximum multipole available given the angular resolution of the considered experiment , for planck we use @xmath91 .",
    "the other specifications we used are listed in table [ planck ] .",
    "the total fisher matrix @xmath92 is then inverted to obtain uncerainties on cosmological parameters of our model .",
    ".specifications for planck experiment used in the fisher matrix calculation . @xmath93 and @xmath94 are sensitivities ( @xmath95 ) for temperature and polarization respectively . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also show the results of an evidence calculation for an even simpler model @xmath96 , in which both the total mass @xmath16 and @xmath31 are fixed , over the model @xmath97 .",
    "note that now we are comparing an @xmath38-parameter model with a @xmath98-parameter model .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ contourlnb ] where we have plotted the contour values of @xmath99 as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the inner contours from @xmath102 to @xmath103 correspond to values @xmath104 , and so to an evidence which favours the simpler model , while the outer contours are relative to values @xmath105 and hence to evidence for the more complicated model @xmath97 .",
    "the star in the plot refers to the wrong assumption of total degeneracy ( but fixing the total mass to the true value @xmath106 ) .",
    "as one can see , under these assumptions the data would favour the simpler model giving a substantial evidence for @xmath96 .",
    "the evidence for the simpler model is due to the smaller number of parameters of @xmath96 with respect to @xmath97 ( the occams razor term , see @xcite ) and also to the negative degeneracy between @xmath31 and @xmath16 ( given by the off - diagonal term of the inverted full fisher matrix @xmath107 ) . because of this degeneracy",
    "there is a _ region of confusion _ in the plane of fig .",
    "[ contourlnb ] in which a wrong assumption in @xmath31 is compensated by a wrong , and opposite in sign , assumption for @xmath108 , leading to evidence in favour of the simpler model @xmath96 .",
    "this explains why in fig .",
    "[ contourlnb ] for a fixed @xmath109 the the bayes factor initially increases becoming greater than @xmath102 for @xmath110 increasing .",
    "of course when @xmath110 becomes large enough the bayes factor decreases because the data start to favour the true model @xmath97 .",
    "if one assumes an inverted hierarchy ( represented by the square in the plot ) , for example fixing the total mass to the minimum value allowed for this hierarchy ( @xmath111 ) and @xmath31 to a low value ( we take @xmath112 ) , one obtains a strong evidence for the more complicated model @xmath97 .",
    "these evidence calculations indicate that a future weak lensing survey could become sensitive to the hierarchy of neutrino masses requiring a suitable parameterization of mass splitting .",
    "we note however that even if a model assuming total degeneracy could be still favoured .",
    "this indicates that planck and euclid data could give strong evidence for the existence of a hierarchy among neutrino masses .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the ability of future cosmic shear measurements , like those achievable with the proposed euclid mission , to constrain differences in the mass of individual neutrino species . using an explicit parameterization of neutrino mass splitting and a fisher matrix formalism we have found that the combination euclid+planck will reach enough sensitivity to put constraints on the fraction of mass in the third neutrino mass eigenstate ( @xmath31 ) under the assumption that the neutrino mass scheme is described by a normal hierarchy , with fiducial value @xmath46 : @xmath113 .",
    "we have also investigated the parameterization dependence of our results , repeating our forecasts calculation for different fiducial values of @xmath31 and finding that constraints on @xmath31 are generally decreasing for increasing @xmath31 .",
    "we have found a loss of sensitivity around @xmath114 due to a strong rotation of the degeneracy in the plane @xmath16-@xmath31 in the euclid fisher matrix , suggesting a considerable dependence of the results on the fiducial value around this point .",
    "+ we have then studied more deeply the power of detecting neutrino mass splitting considering bayesian evidence .",
    "we have found that future data from these experiments will provide strong evidence for a neutrino mass splitting against a model assuming degeneracy of masses . as a consequence",
    "we have also shown that assuming a wrong hierarchy can bias constraints on other cosmological parameters , in particular with those parameters involved in degeneracies with @xmath16 and @xmath31 . for the dark energy equation of state we found a bias greater than the @xmath19 statistical error ( @xmath115 from euclid+planck ) assuming an inverted hierarchy @xmath116 and comparable with @xmath19 assuming degenerate masses @xmath117 .",
    "+ in conclusion we emphasize that , even if these constraints are strongly dependent on the parameterization used , the possibility of having a splitting in neutrino masses can not be neglected in analysing future data from euclid - like experiments .",
    "a wrong assumption about neutrino mass hierarchies can indeed cause non - negligible bias on other cosmological parameters and in particular on the dark energy equation of state .",
