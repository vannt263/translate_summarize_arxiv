    "the _ noise sensitivity _ of a boolean function was introduced in 1999 in a seminal paper of benjamini , kalai and schramm  @xcite , and has since developed into an important area of probability theory ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , linking discrete fourier analysis with percolation theory and combinatorics .",
    "one of the main results of  @xcite gave a sufficient condition for a sequence of functions @xmath1 to be sensitive to small amounts of random noise in the following precise sense : if @xmath2 is chosen uniformly at random , and @xmath3 is obtained from @xmath4 by resampling each variable with some fixed probability @xmath5 , then @xmath6 and @xmath7 are asymptotically independent .",
    "they used this theorem to show that the sequence of functions which encodes crossings of @xmath8 squares in bond percolation on @xmath9 is noise sensitive .",
    "thus , even if one knows all but a _ random _",
    "@xmath10-proportion of the edges , one still ( with high probability ) has very little information about the crossing event .",
    "the authors of  @xcite furthermore made a number of conjectures regarding more precise notions of sensitivity and sensitivity to different types of noise .",
    "several of these conjectures have since played an important role in the subsequent development of the area , most spectacularly in  @xcite and  @xcite , where extremely precise results were obtained about the fourier spectrum of the crossing event , and about the ` dynamical percolation ' process introduced by hggstrm , peres and steif  @xcite and ( independently ) by benjamini , see  @xcite . to give another example",
    ", they made the following conjecture for bernoulli bond percolation on the square lattice : even if you are told the status of _ all _ the vertical edges , you still have very little information about the crossing event .",
    "this conjecture was proved by garban , pete and schramm  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.3 ) , as a consequence of their very precise bounds on the fourier spectrum .",
    "note that in this theorem we are given a _",
    "deterministic _ set of edges ( of density @xmath0 ) , rather than a _ random _ set of edges ( of density @xmath11 ) as in the result stated above .    in this paper , we will prove a similar result ( also conjectured in  @xcite ) in the setting of _ voronoi percolation _ : that knowing the point set ( but not the colours of the cells ) gives asymptotically no information about the crossing event . in order to state our main result",
    "precisely , we will need a few basic definitions .",

    "we say that there is a _ red horizontal crossing _ of @xmath22 if there is a path from the left- to the right - hand side of @xmath22 that only intersects red cells , and write @xmath23 for the event that there exists such a red horizontal crossing of @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath24 , by symmetry .",
    "we refer the reader who is unfamiliar with voronoi percolation to  @xcite for a more extensive introduction .",

    "let @xmath28 be the function such that @xmath29 if and only if @xmath23 holds .",
    "the key new idea of the proof of theorem  [ thm : bksconj ] is the following efron - steif type bound ( see theorem  [ thm : varinf ] , below ) on the variance of the probability of the crossing event in terms of the influences of @xmath30 , which can be viewed as a random boolean function : @xmath31.\\ ] ] recall that the influence @xmath32 of the @xmath33 variable of a boolean function @xmath34 is defined to be the expected absolute change in @xmath35 when the sign of the @xmath33 variable is flipped , i.e. , @xmath36 where @xmath4 is chosen uniformly , and @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath4 by flipping the @xmath33 variable .",
    "benjamini , kalai and schramm  @xcite proved that @xmath38 and moreover introduced a technique ( the ` algorithm method ' , see below ) which can often be used to bound @xmath39 when @xmath35 encodes crossing events in percolation models .",

    "[ thm : qv : ns ] quenched voronoi percolation is almost surely noise sensitive at criticality .    in fact , as a consequence of the schramm - steif method , we obtain a stronger result : that the noise sensitivity exponent for quenched voronoi percolation is positive .",
    "this means that there exists a constant @xmath25 such that   holds even if @xmath44 .",
    "the word ` quenched ' refers to the fact that we are proving a statement which holds for almost all choices of @xmath12 .",
    "the phrase ` at criticality ' refers to the fact that @xmath4 is chosen uniformly at random .",
    "we remind the reader that the critical probability of voronoi percolation in the plane is @xmath0 , as was proved by bollobs and riordan  @xcite .",
    "we remark that theorem  [ thm : qv : ns ] is not the first result of this type for a continuum percolation model .",
    "indeed , a similar theorem for the poisson boolean model is considered to be adjacent if the distance between them is at most 1 .",
    "] was proved by the first three authors with broman  @xcite , and the techniques introduced in that paper have recently been extended by the first three authors with balister and bollobs  @xcite to the settings of ( annealed ) voronoi percolation and the poisson boolean model with random radii .",
    "( in each case the point set @xmath12 is perturbed , together with the colours / radii . )",
    "we emphasize , however , that the techniques introduced in this paper are completely different from those used in  @xcite , where the method involved choosing the point set in two stages , and applying the algorithm method in the non - uniform setting . indeed ,",
    "none of the previously - introduced techniques seem to have any chance of working in the setting of quenched voronoi percolation .",
    "as mentioned above , in order to use the algorithm method we will need to prove a 1-arm estimate that will follow from a quenched version of the box - crossing property for voronoi percolation at criticality .",
    "this result gives bounds on the probability that a rectangle ( of fixed aspect ratio ) is crossed at criticality , and is an analogue of the celebrated results for bond percolation on @xmath9 of russo  @xcite and seymour and welsh  @xcite .",
    "corresponding results have been obtained in various related settings , and obtaining such bounds is frequently a key step in the proof of various important applications , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in particular , an important breakthrough was made by bollobs and riordan  @xcite , who proved an rsw - type theorem for ( annealed ) voronoi percolation such that the probability of crossing an @xmath45 rectangle is bounded away from 0 .",
    "] , and used it to deduce that the critical probability for percolation is @xmath0 .",
    "the full box - crossing property in the annealed setting was obtained only very recently , by the fourth author  @xcite .",
    "we remark that this result will play an important role in our proof of theorem  [ thm : rsw ] , below . as above , we write @xmath46 for the event that there is a red horizontal crossing of @xmath47 .",

    "then @xmath50 as @xmath41 .",
    "we remark that , moreover , for every @xmath51 there exists @xmath52 such that @xmath53 has probability at most @xmath54 .",
    "an analogous theorem if @xmath12 is a poisson point process in the plane ( or in the half - plane ) follows by exactly the same proof",
    ".    we will prove theorem  [ thm : rsw ] in three steps .",
    "first , we will prove a weaker result for voronoi percolation in the plane ( see theorem  [ thm : rsw : plane ] ) : this says that there exists a constant @xmath25 such that @xmath55 for all sufficiently large @xmath56 .",
    "we will then deduce an analogous statement for voronoi percolation in a half - plane ; somewhat surprisingly , the deduction is not trivial , and we will have to do some work to deal with the boundary effects ( see section  [ sec : rsw : halfplane ] ) . finally , we will use these results , together with the algorithm method ( see section  [ sec : proof ] ) and our efron - stein type inequality  , proved in section  [ sec : varinf ] , to show ( see theorem  [ thm : bks : rectangle ] ) that @xmath57\\ ] ] in probability , as @xmath41 .",
    "this result will imply both theorem  [ thm : bksconj ] and theorem  [ thm : rsw ] , using the box - crossing property for annealed voronoi proved in  @xcite .",
    "the organisation of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : varinf ] , we will bound the variance of the probability of the crossing event by the expected sum of the squares of the influences of @xmath30 .",
    "we will do so by introducing a martingale , whose steps correspond to choosing the points of @xmath12 one - by - one , and bounding the variance of step @xmath58 in terms of the expectation of the square of the influence of the @xmath33 element of @xmath12 , see lemma  [ lem : key : varinf ] .",
    "armed with this lemma , the claimed bound   follows easily .",
    "second , in section  [ sec : rsw ] , we will prove weak bounds for the crossing probabilities in quenched voronoi percolation   in both the plane , and the half - plane .",
    "the key tools in our ( surprisingly simple ) proof will be the ` box - crossing property ' for annealed voronoi percolation , proved in  @xcite , together with colour - switching .",
    "in particular , we would like to highlight lemma  [ magic : lemma ] , which states that @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the random variable which counts the number of vertex - disjoint vertical monochromatic crossings of @xmath47 .",
    "although this lemma , once stated , is easy to prove , we have found it to be extremely useful , and expect it to have many other applications .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : proof ] , we will complete the proof of the main theorems , by using the algorithm method of benjamini , kalai and schramm  @xcite and schramm and steif  @xcite to bound the sum of the squares of the influences of @xmath30 .",
    "( indeed , once we are armed with the results of section  [ sec : rsw ] , the required bound follows by simply repeating the method of  @xcite . ) combining this bound with the results of section  [ sec : varinf ] , we obtain theorem  [ thm : bksconj ] . by  , we obtain theorem  [ thm : qv : ns ] , and by the box - crossing property for annealed voronoi percolation  @xcite , we obtain theorem  [ thm : rsw ] .",
    "in this section , we will prove a somewhat surprising bound on the ( typical ) dependence of the crossing event on the point set @xmath12 in terms of the ( expected ) influences of the colours . since we will need to use the results of this section in the proof of theorem  [ thm : rsw ] , as well as that of theorem  [ thm : bksconj ]",
