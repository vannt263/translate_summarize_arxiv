    "the most luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are known as quasars .",
    "broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars are those quasars which show ultraviolet absorption troughs thousands of kms@xmath1 wide ( e.g. , lynds 1967 ; allen et  al .",
    "2011 ) , widths for which the accretion process in quasars is thought to be ultimately responsible .",
    "the traditional minimum velocity width for a bal trough is 2000  km  s@xmath1  at 10% depth below the continuum ( weymann et  al .",
    "objects with narrower intrinsic absorption troughs , down to 500  km  s@xmath1  wide , are often referred to as mini - bal quasars ( e.g. , hamann & sabra 2004 ) .",
    "objects with intrinsic troughs @xmath2500  km  s@xmath1  wide are referred to as narrow absorption line ( nal ) quasars ( see , e.g. , ganguly & brotherton 2008 ) .",
    "intrinsic troughs are those which arise from gas connected with the accretion process onto the quasar , as opposed to arising elsewhere in the host galaxy , but it is not always possible to determine the origin of a given absorption system . if studying intrinsic quasar absorption regardless of velocity width is the goal , less restrictive minimum width definitions for bal troughs can be established ( hall et  al .",
    "2002 ; trump et  al .",
    "however , such definitions also run the risk of increased contamination from intervening absorption systems ( knigge et  al .",
    "intervening absorption systems unrelated to the quasar will generally have widths @xmath2500  km  s@xmath1 , but blending and clustering can produce apparently broader absorption profiles , especially in spectra where the resolution or signal - to - noise ratio ( or both ) is relatively low .",
    "bal quasars are often subdivided into three subtypes depending on the ionization stages seen in absorption ( e.g. , hall et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "high - ionization bal quasars ( hibals ) have absorption from civ@xmath31548,1550  ( all wavelengths in  ) , nv@xmath31238,1242 , and ovi@xmath31031,1037 , and are the most common subtype .",
    "low - ionization bal quasars ( lobals ) have high - ionization absorption plus absorption from cii@xmath41334 , aliii@xmath31854,1862 , and/or mgii@xmath32796,2803 .",
    "iron low - ionization bal quasars ( felobals ) have high- and low - ionization absorption plus absorption from excited states of feii  and/or feiii , and are the least common subtype .",
    "bal troughs are found over a wide range of velocities relative to the quasar , both collectively and in individual objects .",
    "the traditional velocity range over which the strength of bal troughs detected in civ@xmath31548,1550  is evaluated is @xmath525000  km  s@xmath1  to @xmath53000  km  s@xmath1  ( weymann et  al . 1991 ) , where we adopt the convention that negative velocities denote absorption blueshifted from the quasar redshift .",
    "the high - velocity cutoff was established to avoid confusion with siiv / oiv]@xmath41400  emission and siiv@xmath31393,1402  bal troughs ; the low - velocity to avoid strong associated narrow - line civ  complexes .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the convention that quasars with troughs @xmath62000  km  s@xmath1  wide , regardless of the trough velocity offset , are bal quasars . in that case ,",
    "the highest velocity known for a bal outflow is either @xmath556000  km  s@xmath1  in pg  2302 + 029 ( jannuzi et  al . 1996 ) or @xmath566000  km  s@xmath1  in h  1414 + 089 ( foltz et  al . 1983 ) .",
    "extending the velocity limits within which bal troughs are measured to the widest possible wavelength range accessible in a given quasar sample is necessary if the goal is to study all broad intrinsic absorption in quasars .",
    "one drawback of that approach is contamination of low - velocity troughs with complexes of associated narrow - line absorption at the systemic redshift ; studies at spectral resolution sufficient to resolve such complexes can help account for this effect .",
    "another drawback is contamination of high - velocity troughs in one transition with low - velocity troughs of a shorter - wavelength transition ( e.g. , high - velocity civ@xmath31548,1550  with low - velocity siiv@xmath31393,1402 ) .",
    "physical considerations based on elemental abundances and ionization fractions can be used to correcly identify troughs in such cases ; for example , civ  absorption can be seen without accompanying siiv , but the reverse is not true ( see , e.g. , gibson et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "as long as care is taken to account for the above effects , the ideal starting velocity for measuring the strength of bal troughs is easy to define : the starting velocity for a given trough should be chosen to encompass the entire trough in that transition .    in principle , studying bal troughs may require starting velocities which are redshifted relative to the quasar rest frame .",
    "hall et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) presented two quasars with mgii  troughs showing absorption both blueshifted and redshifted relative to the quasar rest frame : sdss j112526.12@xmath7002901.3 ( j1125 ) and sdss j112828.31@xmath7011337.9 ( j1128 ) .",
    "we suggested that these are systems where the quasar s extended ultraviolet continuum source is seen through an outflow which is dominated along our line of sight by its rotational velocity .",
    "this possibility had earlier been raised in the context of nal outflows by ganguly et  al .",

    "more objects and better systemic redshift determinations will be useful in interpreting this diagram . if the separation of different trough shapes in this diagram persists with more objects added and after more study of selection effects , that may suggest that different mechanisms are responsible for different trough shapes .    to summarize , in our objects the ai and ai@xmath58 values are uncorrelated overall , but the ai@xmath59  values are a statistical match to the ai distribution for standard bal quasars .",

    "the absorbing gas in our objects has avoided overionization and is experiencing a net outward force from scattered uv radiation , so why is it infalling ? one possible answer",
    "is that the absorbing gas is unusually dense , which might also help explain the high fraction of lobals in our sample (  [ lobals ] ) .",
    "denser gas will have a lower ionization parameter , all else being equal , and is plausibly more likely to form optically thick structures .",

    "thus , dense gas clumps formed by swept - up lower - density gas may end up in infall ( nayakshin & zubovas 2012 ) .    in this scenario ,",
    "more variability should occur at larger redshifted velocities than at smaller ones , because gas with larger infall velocities is likely to have larger transverse velocities as well .",

    "a key test of the infall hypothesis will be to compute absorption profiles for the simulations to determine if they can match the apparent optical depths of the ionization stages seen in these objects ( e.g. , sim et  al .",
    "2012 ) . in observed cases where the absorption profiles are smooth over a large velocity range , the infall motions must be ordered so that our line of sight intercepts most of the infall trajectory . in that case",
    "the gas must have lost considerable angular momentum and have avoided shocking to unobservably high temperatures and ionization stages during the accretion process .",
    "gas with such properties will be rare , but redshifted",

    "furthermore , we can argue against infalling gas in some objects following  4.2 of martin & bouch ( 2009 ) , who point out that the covering factor of optically thick structures in a wind changes in a predictable way with radius . in bal quasars where civ  and siiv  are of comparable depth , the absorbing gas is almost certainly optically thick , with the depth of the troughs determined by the covering factor of the absorbing structures ( crenshaw et  al .",

    "conceptually , gas clumps free - falling toward a quasar do not shrink as fast as the surface area around the quasar shrinks ( unless the pressure increases implausibly fast with decreasing radius ) , leading to an increasing covering factor with increasing redshifted velocity .",

    "while in others ( e.g. , j1019 and j1724 ) , aliii  is limited to less redshifted velocities .    in summary :",
    "for the case of adiabatic compression , infalling gas is ruled out as an explanation for redshifted troughs with _",

    "we can write the time required for gas with an azimuthal velocity equal to the keplerian velocity at its radius of @xmath197 to pass in front of the continuum - emitting region of the accretion disc ( @xmath198 ) in units of the orbital timescale at @xmath176 as @xmath199/\\pi}{({r_{\\rm con}/r})^{3/2}}.\\ ] ] as @xmath136 increases , this ratio declines from 0.5 at @xmath200 to a minimum value of 0.412 at 1.2@xmath200 before increasing to @xmath90.5 at 2.3@xmath200 and @xmath91 at 10@xmath200 .",
    "( note that the above is a lower limit to the true crossing time , as angular momentum conservation lowers the rotational velocity of outflowing gas far from its launch radius below the keplerian velocity at that radius .",

    "thus , variability on a timescale dependent on the continuum source size and black hole mass is expected in this model , with the most common variability pattern being absorption appearing at blueshifted velocities and moving to redshifted velocities .",
    "note that variability can be avoided if the winds have sufficiently small azimuthal variations in their covering factors and/or transmitted flux over more than one orbital time .",
    "( and large azimuthal variations in @xmath213 can occur without causing variability as long as @xmath57 is always satisfied . ) such high levels of symmetry would only be possible for @xmath21-shaped and @xmath22-shaped troughs , as azimuthal asymmetry is required to explain _",
    "v_-shaped   troughs in this model .",
    "whether such high levels of symmetry are possible is an open question , but some bal outflows do appear to have substantial azimuthal symmetry ( e.g. , gibson et  al . 2010 ) .      a rotating disc wind model can in principle produce the redshifted _ velocities _ observed in these objects , but such a model has difficulty explaining the observed variability in several of our objects .",
    "gravitational redshifting may help explain the prevalence of absorption that extends farther in the redshifted velocity direction than the blueshifted , as well as the four or five cases of redshifted troughs with depths greater than 50% of the continuum , but overall , a simple rotating disc wind model does not cleanly explain all objects in our sample . determining how often , if ever , rotating outflows can exhibit the parameters required to match these redshifted troughs will be a useful goal for analytic and numerical simulations .",

    "this scenario is viable in cases where the quasars are far enough apart ( @xmath215  pc or so ) that they do not dramatically disrupt each other s accretion discs , fueling , or bal outflows .",
    "a large projected area of the flow on the sky increases the chance of backlighting , and some bal outflows are known to extend to kpc scales ( e.g. , edmonds et  al .",
    "2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "different parts of the outflow along the same sightline could have different redshifts or blueshifts .",
    "the binary scenario may be favored for _",

    "we inspected available images of our objects for evidence supporting a binary quasar scenario for their spectra .",

    "near - ir imaging from ukidss ( warren et  al . 2007 ) confirms that j0941 is not a pure point source , but yields no evidence for binarity in j0805 , j1019 , j1439 or j2157 .",
    "also , deep coadds of sdss imaging data in stripe 82 ( annis et  al . 2011 ) show no evidence for binarity in j0028 or j2157",

    "individual objects would require high - resolution imaging , multiwavelength photometry , or near - ir spectroscopy to search for narrow line emission at two redshifts .",
    "note that there is no evidence for two narrow - line redshifts in our two low - redshift quasars with redshifted mgii  absorption ( figure [ fj11 ] ) .",
    "the conditions outlined in this section are very similar to those proposed by civano et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) as one scenario to explain the @xmath216 agn cxoc j100043.1@xmath7020637 ( hereafter cxoc j1000 ) .",

    "it also exhibits a strong x - ray iron emission line accompanied by redshifted iron absorption .",
    "in contrast to our objects , the absorption in cxoc j1000 is deepest at the longest wavelengths ( greatest redshifted velocities ) .",
    "civano et  al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012 ) suggest that the foreground object in that system could be a heavily obscured type 2 ( narrow - line ) agn with an outflowing , high - velocity , highly ionized wind backlit by the x - ray continuum of a background type 1 ( broad - line ) agn .",
    "the velocity vector of the backlit portion of the wind must be oriented so as to produce a redshift .",
    "the large velocity difference between the redshfts of the two agn could arise from a gravitational interaction .",
    "another effect may be at work in this model , for both cxoc j1000 and any binary quasar in our sample .",
    "if the wind from the foreground object has a sufficiently large velocity , the relativistic doppler shift can produce significantly redshifted absorption even when the backlit wind is directed near the plane of the sky .",
    "we discuss the relativistic doppler shift in  [ doppler ] .",
    "we can estimate whether or not the abundance of bal quasars with redshifted troughs is consistent with a scenario explaining them as silhouetted outflows in binary quasar systems .",
    "we start with 69674 @xmath56 boss quasars examined for redshifted troughs . at @xmath56 ,",
    "5  kpc is a separation small enough for the system to appear unresolved in sdss imaging .",
    "approximately 0.04@xmath200.01% of luminous sdss quasars have binary companions at projected radii between @xmath95 and @xmath9100  kpc ( myers et  al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ; hennawi et  al . 2010 ) . the binary fraction at projected",
    "radii @xmath305  kpc is likely to be a factor of @xmath910 lower , based on how long merging or interacting galaxies spend at a given projected separation ( liu et  al .",
    "thus , we expect only @xmath93 binary quasars at @xmath305  kpc separation in the 69674 boss dr9q quasars . even if we make the extreme assumption that all quasars in such close binaries host bal outflows with covering factor @xmath175=100% out to a radius of 5  kpc , only half of such binaries will have an optically faint or obscured quasar as the foreground object and an optically brighter quasar as the background object , as required in our scenario .",
    "thus , while a small number of silhouetted outflows may be present in our sample , to explain our entire sample with them would require binary quasars at projected radii @xmath305  kpc to be a factor of @xmath910 more abundant than current studies indicate .",
    "furthermore , their outflows would have to have a geometry and distribution of covering factors able to explain why both blueshifted and redshifted absorption are seen in 10 out of 13 objects targeted by the boss as @xmath217 quasar candidates .",
    "that fraction is much larger than expected if blueshifted and redshifted absorption are uncorrelated .",
    "a final possibility for producing redshifted absorption is the relativistic doppler shift ( einstein 1905 ) . in its own rest frame",
    ", an ion absorbs at the rest wavelength of a given transition . in a frame",
    "in which the ion is moving ( in any direction ) then  in addition to the normal doppler shift  time dilation means that the ion will absorb photons of a lower frequency ( longer wavelength ) .",
    "normally the time dilation factor is negligible , but it has been observed in the galactic microquasar ss  433 in emission lines which arise from two oppositely directed jets moving at 0.26@xmath195 near to the plane of the sky ( abell & margon 1979 ) . if there is absorbing gas in some or all of these bal quasars moving at a sufficiently high speed over a range of angles close to the plane of the sky , the resulting absorption will be seen at a range of velocities which can span both blueshifts and redshifts relative to the quasar rest frame .    in appendix [ rds ]",
    "we discuss some underappreciated aspects of the relativistic doppler shift relevant to line _ absorption _",
    "( for example , absorption at a given blueshifted wavelength does not uniquely determine the velocity of the outflow even if its angle to the line of sight is known ) .",
    "few papers on the effects of the relativistic doppler shift on absorption have appeared in the astronomical literature ( sher 1968 ; hovsepyan 1998 ; wang 2011 ) , in contrast to the numerous papers applying it to line _ emission _ in quasars ( beginning with mathews 1982 ) , in this section we consider only the potential application of the relativistic doppler shift to the absorption in our objects .",
    "we use @xmath218 to denote the angle relative to our line of sight , with @xmath219 pointing away from us and @xmath220 denoting the plane of the sky .    as an example , for a flow reaching the highest speeds seen in quasar outflows ( @xmath221 ) , a range of angles centered slightly toward the line of sight ( @xmath222 ) would be sufficient to explain the trough in j2157 ( approximately @xmath52000  km  s@xmath1  to 10,000  km  s@xmath1 ) . for",
    "a flow reaching a top speed of only @xmath223 , reproducing the same trough would require twice as wide a range of angles , centered slightly away from the line of sight ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "similarly , gas at a range of speeds from @xmath225 at @xmath220 would produce redshifted troughs spanning 0 to + 6000  km  s@xmath1 , but an identical trough could be produced by gas at lower velocities directed slightly away from the observer ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "producing redshifted troughs via the relativistic doppler effect does not require large gas inflow velocities , but does require even larger velocities nearly transverse to our line of sight to a quasar s continuum source .",
    "one scenario which could generate large transverse velocities is a nearly vertical outflow launched from small radii , where the initial rotational velocity and radiative acceleration are both large , and viewed at a large inclination angle .",
    "the relativistic doppler effect also could be a factor if any object is involved in a binary quasar scenario (  [ binary ] ) . in that scenario , the outflow velocity as well as the rotational velocity can contribute to the transverse velocity .    in either case , large transverse velocities should result in variability in the redshifted troughs on the crossing timescale of the continuum source by the gas .",
    "gas moving at @xmath227 crosses the 1550  continuum region of our fiducial @xmath201 @xmath128 bh + ss73 disc in 21 days",
    ". the crossing time would be at most 2.2 times longer at 2800  than at 1550  for an ss73 disc , but could be 5 to 15 times longer at both wavelengths ( 105 to 315 days ) given the observationally inferred sizes of quasar continuum source regions ( blackburne et  al .",

    "we have presented observations of seventeen quasars with redshifted broad absorption in civ  and siiv  ( and often in numerous other transitions ) and new observations of two previously known quasars with redshifted broad absorption in mgii .",
    "roughly 1 in 1000 bal quasars has redshifted civ  absorption (  [ frac ] ) , although such absorption appears to be more common in the sdss - iii / boss dr9 quasar catalog ( 1 in 660 ) than in the sdss - i / ii dr7 quasar catalog ( 1 in 1600 ) . why these objects are so rare , given that infalling matter is ultimately the power source for all quasars , is not clear",
    ".    the absorption in these objects can extend to velocities of @xmath610,000  km  s@xmath1  and appears just as saturated as absorption in standard , blueshifted bal troughs does .",
    "the trough shapes can be classified as either @xmath21-shaped , _ v_-shaped   or @xmath22-shaped (  [ uvw ] ) .",
    "although absorption at the systemic redshift in these objects sometimes reaches zero flux within the noise , none of their redshifted absorption troughs do so , meaning that the redshifted absorption does not fully cover the continuum source . the redshifted absorption does not need to cover the broad emission line region to explain the observations ( with one exception ) , but we can not rule out equal covering of both the continuum and emission ine regions .",
    "we have used the absorption index (  [ ai ] ) to measure the strengths of the blueshifted absorption ( ai ) , the redshifted absorption ( ai@xmath58 ) , and the total absorption ( ai@xmath59 ) in these objects .",

    "the redshifted velocities of these troughs are unusual , but their overall strengths are not .    based on our sample , at least 50% of quasars with redshifted civ  absorption are lobal quasars , as compared to 5% of standard quasars being lobal quasars (  [ lobals ] )",
    ". however , the ai@xmath59  distribution of these objects is not at all consistent with the ai distribution of standard lobal quasars (  [ ai ] ) .",

    ", we infer that the absorber has a very high density ( @xmath112@xmath31 ) and a small distance from the ionizing continuum source ( @xmath126  pc ) .",
    "we have discussed possible explanations for redshifted troughs including gravitational redshifts (  [ grav ] ) , infall (  [ infall ] ) , rotating disc - wind outflows (  [ rotation ] ) , outflows from one member of a binary quasar pair seen in absorption against the other (  [ binary ] ) , and the relativistic doppler effect in outflows moving close to transverse to our line of sight (  [ doppler ] ) .",
    "none of these explanations by themselves seems likely to explain all our objects .",
    "the binary quasar scenario can explain the observed range of trough shapes , velocities and absorption indices .",
    "however , a factor of @xmath910 excess in the numbers of close binary quasars over the predictions of current studies would be needed to explain our sample entirely as binary quasars ; this scenario can not be the dominant explanation .",

    "it is possible that some of our objects will be explained by one scenario and some by the other .",
    "infalling gas undergoing adiabatic compression is expected to have an increasing covering factor with infall velocity , making it a plausible explanation only for some @xmath21-shaped and @xmath22-shaped troughs .",
    "the infall velocities observed in our objects have been seen in simulations of gas infall in quasars , but whether the gas at those velocities can match the large optical depths observed in civ  and other species is not clear . in this scenario",
    ", the high fraction of low - ionization redshifted troughs would be due to preferential infall of high - density gas .",
    "however , the match between the distributions of ai@xmath59  in bal quasars with redshifted absorption and ai in standard bal quasars is not explained by this model .",
    "rotation - dominated disc winds can explain the distributions of absorption indices in these objects , at least for @xmath21-shaped and @xmath22-shaped troughs .",
    "rotation plus gravitational redshifting can in principle explain the range of trough shapes and velocity extents in this scenario .",
    "low - ionization absorption might be preferentially seen in this model due to winds with relatively high - density gas having relatively low terminal velocities ( perhaps not even exceeding the escape velocity ) , enabling redshifted velocities due to rotation to dominate the absorption profile .",
    "however , the variability properties available for a subset of our objects ( see below ) do not match the predictions of this scenario .",
    "the observed variability of bal troughs is believed to be due primarily to tranverse motions of absorbing gas across the continuum source ( e.g. , gibson et  al . 2010 ; hall et  al . 2011 ) , although cases are known where the variability in narrower quasar outflows are more consistent with changes in the ionization of the absorbing gas ( misawa et  al .",
    "2007 ; hamann et  al . 2011 ) . in this section",
    "we discuss what each scenario considered herein for the origin of redshifted bal troughs might predict for the variability of those troughs .",
    "future spectroscopic observations of these objects will be required to test these predictions . in all cases ,",
    "what matters for variability is the transverse motion of the absorber and its size relative to the continuum source , not the distance of the absorber from the continuum source ; as both are at the same cosmological distance from us , only their relative sizes matter .    in each of our suggested models for redshifted troughs , strong variability on timescales of less than a year",
    "is possible because large transverse motions are possible .",
    "not observing rapid variability in any of these objects over time would constrain the rotating wind model to ever greater azimuthal symmetry , the infall scenario to more ordered infall , the binary quasar scenario to smaller transverse velocities , and would rule out a substantial contribution from a relativistic doppler shift .    in the infall scenario ,",
    "more variability should occur at larger redshifted velocities , because gas with larger infall velocities is likely to have larger transverse velocities as well . in the quasar j1628 ,",
    "a shift of the absorption to smaller average redshifted velocities has been seen .",
    "if the absorption is due to gas undergoing decelerating infall due to outward radiative acceleration , future observations should show a continued shift to smaller average redshifted velocities and increasing deceleration .",
    "variability in the rotation - dominated wind scenario has been discussed in  [ rotabs ] . the pattern expected for the simplest variability scenario",
    "( changes in absorption strength propagating from blueshifted to redshifted velocities ) has been seen in only one of the four cases where two epochs of high s / n spectroscopy are available .",
    "a lack of variability in _ v_-shaped   outflows on rest - frame timescales of two years or more would rule out this scenario for such objects .    in the binary quasar scenario , variability at blueshifted and redshifted velocities",
    "will be uncorrelated .",
    "the level of variability in this scenario depends on the transverse velocity of the silhouetted outflow relative to the background quasar .",
    "the variability could be comparable to that in standard bal quasars , but might be lower if bal outflows decrease substantially in velocity at large outflow distances due to the sweeping up of ambient gas ( faucher - giguere , quataert & murray 2011 ) .    in the case of absorption redshifts arising from a relativistic doppler shift ,",
    "the variability of such absorption is likely to be more substantial than the variability of a standard bal trough , as the large transverse velocity of the gas causes it to traverse the continuum source quickly .",
    "a final unusual aspect of these quasars with redshifted broad absorption is that most of them have strong and relatively narrow ly@xmath29  emission ( nine of fifteen objects with ly@xmath29  coverage have such emission ) .",
    "although it may be possible to produce apparent narrow ly@xmath29  emission via ly@xmath29  and nv  absorption of underlying broad emission ( e.g. , hall et  al .",
    "2004c ) , absorption in those lines is not always strong in these objects .",
    "a full comparison of the ly@xmath29  properties of these objects and of dr9q quasars is beyond the scope of this paper , but the prevalence of strong , narrow ly@xmath29  emission argues against a rotating accretion - disc scenario for redshifted civ  absorption , as there is no obvious explanation for such ly@xmath29  emission in such scenarios .",
    "our objects ly@xmath29  fwhms are near the upper end of the 5002000  km  s@xmath1  range of the fwhms of ly@xmath29  emission from the regions of neutral gas near high - redshift galaxies known as ly@xmath29  blobs ( 2006 ; smith & jarvis 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "the fluxes of our objects narrow ly@xmath29  lines are about an order of magnitude larger than in the most luminous ly@xmath29  blobs known ( steidel et  al . 2000 ) , so the lines must arise predominantly from illumination by the quasar .",
    "the strong , relatively narrow ly@xmath29  emission in our quasars might arise due to larger than usual amounts of neutral gas in the quasar host galaxy and surrounding environs .",
    "an excess of such gas would be consistent with the infall explanation for these objects .",
    "narrow - band imaging or longslit spectroscopy of these objects to ascertain the spatial extent of their ly@xmath29  emission might constrain the origin of the gas responsible .",
    "a variety of further observations of these objects would be useful to determine their nature .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy could provide accurate redshifts and possible evidence for binarity via narrow emission lines in the rest - frame optical .",
    "continued monitoring of these objects spectra at observed optical wavelengths will establish the variability properties of the full sample .",
    "high - resolution uv / optical spectroscopy of some objects may better constrain the column densities of the absorbing gas and thereby its physical properties and location as well .",
    "x - ray observations could help discriminate between the different models we have put forward .",
    "quasars observed to have the same strong x - ray absorption seen in standard bal quasars with the same trough strength and ionization range distributions as our sample are candidates for having rotating disc winds . in the infall scenario , however , the redshifted gas observed in front of these quasars uv emitting regions may not cover the smaller x - ray emitting region , or may have the same covering factor for both regions ( if the absorbing gas consists of many small clouds , for example ) .",
    "thus , in this scenario quasars with only redshifted absorption may have x - ray properties similar to those of normal , non - bal quasars ( i.e. , no significant x - ray absorption , normal x - ray spectral shape , and nominal optical to x - ray flux ratio ) .    larger samples of quasars with redshifted troughs would better establish how common they are and how their trough properties compare to those of standard , blueshifted - trough bal quasars .",
    "the goal of the boss is to obtain at least 150,000 spectra of @xmath217 quasars , and the dr9q catalog contains only @xmath962,000 such objects ; therefore , an increase in the sample size a factor @xmath92.5 can be expected in the boss alone .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of candidate cases and a dedicated search for redshifted mgii  absorption extending to lower redshifts ( especially where [ oii ]  emission at the systemic redshift can be seen ) could increase this number still further .",
    "furthermore , the existence of redshifted bal troughs raises the possibility that the processes producing them could also create narrower redshifted troughs .",
    "that possibility may complicate the interpretation of the velocity distribution of narrow absorbers around quasar redshifts solely in terms of infall and clustering ( e.g. , wild et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "regardless of the origin of redshifted bal troughs , they provide a rare but useful probe of quasars and their environs .",
    "any which are due to infall of gas offer a test of models of gas dynamics and agn fueling and feedback in galaxies during epochs of agn activity .",
    "any which are due to rotating accretion disc winds offer a test of models of such winds .",
    "any which are due to binary quasars offer a new view of bal outflows ; namely , along lines of sight which do not intersect the quasar which launched them .",
    "such cases offer probes of bal outflow properties at known projected distances from their launch site , enabling new tests of models of bal dynamics .",

    "hewett & wild ( 2010 ) give @xmath19=3.410@xmath200.009 , which is clearly too low a redshift .",
    "there is narrow ly@xmath29  absorption at @xmath19=3.4500@xmath200.0005 , consistent with the redshift of the broad ciii ]  line , and so we adopt that as the systemic redshift . however , the dr9q ciii ]  redshift is @xmath19=3.491 , in which case its absorption troughs would be purely blueshifted .",
    "examination of the ciii ]  emission region suggests that the true systemic redshift lies somewhere between these two values .",
    "therefore , we consider this object only a candidate for redshifted absorption until a more robust systemic redshift is available .",
    "both sdss and boss spectra are available for j1704 , which is slightly fainter in the boss epoch .",

    "j1704 has troughs extending across our adopted systemic redshift in siiv , civ  and aliii  from at least @xmath261 km  s@xmath1  to @xmath262 km  s@xmath1 , and blueshifted troughs in aliii , alii , cii , oi / siii , siii , nv , ciii *  and ovi , with spans of up to @xmath263  km  s@xmath1 . because the redshifted portions of the civ , siiv  and aliii  troughs in this object extend only to @xmath9 + 2500  km  s@xmath1 , it is possible that they are blends of narrow associated absorbers which appear redshifted due to their peculiar velocities ( e.g. , wild et  al .",
    "that possibility can be tested with high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "it is also possible that there is some feii * absorption in this object between civ  and ciii ] .",
    "however , the wavelengths and strengths of those feii * transitions are not a good match to the apparent redshifted absorption in j1704 , which does match siiv , civ  and aliii  in wavelength .    finally , for * sdss j213342.06@xmath7071408.77 * ( j2133 ; fig .",
    "[ f_cands3 ] ) we conservatively adopt a systemic redshift of @xmath19=2.165 from our inspection of the spectrum ( the dr9q pca and mgii pca  redshifts are @xmath19@xmath162.1 ) .",
    "j2133 has troughs at the adopted systemic redshift , plus candidate redshifted troughs , in civ , siiv , and nv . it is listed as a candidate primarily because the low signal - to - noise ratio of its spectrum makes both its systemic redshift and the reality of the putative redshifted troughs uncertain .",
    "for example , while no dr9q ciii ]  pca redshift is available for this object , its dr9q full pca redshift is @xmath19=2.096 , which if correct would make its troughs even more redshifted .",
    "in this section we discuss a number of quasars which have apparent redshifted absorption features in their spectra which are not real .    in figure [ f_candfe2 ]",
    "we show spectra of quasars wherein absorption from excited - state feii  ( feii * ) resembles redshifted high - ionization absorption . the quasar sdss j074850.40 + 442439.0 ( hereafter j0748 )",
    "is shown in the top panel .",
    "it is an felobal with apparent redshifted absorption in civ  but not in siiv .",
    "however , closer inspection of its spectrum from 1350  to 1750  ( middle panel ) reveals that the apparent redshifted civ  absorption is part of a complex of feii * absorption with many strong transitions between civ  and ciii ]  but only one or two strong transitions between siiv  and civ  ( see  5.1.1 of hall et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "such feii * absorption can blend together to masquerade as a redshifted civ  trough in other quasars such as sdss j094633.97@xmath7365516.8 and sdss 144424.54 + 013457.0 ( not shown ) and sdss j105442.44 + 060610.8 ( bottom panel ) . in that panel",
    "the dotted lines show feii * absorption at the redshift of strongest absorption in other transitions ( dashed lines ) .",
    "some of the feii * absorbs the civ  emission line , weakening it relative to the siiv  emission line , and some absorbs part of the continuum between rest - frame 1600  and 1750 . in this object",
    "there is little evidence for additional feii * absorption between 2330  and 2630  which should be present , as it arises from the same lower levels as the observed absorption .",
    "most likely , the absorption is present but is blended with feii  emission so as to mimic a relatively smooth continuum .",
    "feii  and feiii  emission may be at work in sdss j213150.07@xmath5004546.9 ( j2131 ; figure [ fj2131rej ] ) , which we considered , but ultimately rejected , as a redshifted - absorption candidate .",
    "this object has a secure redshift from aliii+siiii]+ciii ]  emission .",
    "an extrapolation of the continuum longward of ciii ]  to shorter wavelengths generates the appearance of strong , redshifted troughs of civ , siiv , and nv . however , the detailed shape and position of the putative troughs do not agree with that identification .",
    "( e.g. , what looks like a moderately broad trough at 4700  in the smoothed spectrum is actually the blended siiv  doublet of an intervening metal - line absorber at @xmath264 . ) therefore , the unusual feature in this spectrum is not redshifted absorption but the huge apparent emission feature from 17002300 .",
    "this feature is somewhat reminiscent of that in sdss j033810.85 + 005617.6 (  5.3.5 of hall et  al .",
    "2002 ) , but is likely due to some combination of blended feii  and feiii  emission and an extinction curve steeper than that of the smc (  5.3 of hall et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "another source of apparent redshifted absorption features is unrecognized flaws in the data .",
    "such flaws are a possibility in any pipeline , and spurious broad features have previously been seen in some sdss spectra ( see , e.g. , hall et  al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "experience has shown that spectra from certain sdss fibers , including # 374 , are more prone to spurious features .",
    "for example , sdss j124224.78@xmath7364537.1 ( sdss plate - mjd - fiber 2022 - 53827 - 374 and boss 3973 - 55323 - 0536 ) had an apparent redshifted civ  trough in sdss which was not confirmed by boss spectroscopy .",
    "inspection of the individual spectroscopic exposures in the sdss revealed that the trough was indeed spurious .",
    "the apparent trough is located in the wavelength range where the coverage of the red and blue arms of the sdss spectrographs overlap .",
    "a decrease in flux at the trough wavelengths was present in all of the spectra from the blue arm but none of the spectra from the red arm .",
    "the pixels from the blue arm were not rejected , resulting in a spurious trough .",
    "other examples of spurious troughs involving sdss fiber # 374 include sdss j004418.96@xmath5090009.4 and sdss j171216.27 + 660212.0 .    as another example of spurious features tied to certain fibers , the sdss spectrum of the bl lac object om  280 ( sdss j115019.21 + 241753.8 , plate - mjd - fiber 2510 - 53877 - 086 ) appears to show a trough at @xmath94150 .",
    "this trough is spurious , likely arising from a region of problematic flatfielding ( e.g. , due to a localized variable feature in the flatfield ) in the ccd in the blue arm of sdss spectrograph # 1 .",
    "this region is visible as a circular depression on the reduced 2-d spectrograms of that ccd in that wavelength range , centered near fiber 81 .",
    "the affected wavelength region is interpolated over for fibers 7884 , but its effects can sometimes be seen in other nearby fibers such as # 86 ( used for the spectrum of om 280 ) , # 76 ( producing a similar spurious trough in sdss j115013.88 + 234602.1 ) , and possibly # 73 , in which case it could explain the apparent trough in the sdss spectrum of the bl lac object pks0138@xmath5097 ( shaohua et  al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "lastly , inspection of both spectroscopy and imaging can also identify cases of apparent redshifted absorption caused by superpositions .",
    "for example , the star - quasar blend sdss j120749.19 + 082406.7 has an apparent redshifted aliii  trough from the stellar mg  b feature .",
    "sher ( 1968 ) discuss the implications of the relativistic doppler effect in terms of the radial and total velocities of the source .",
    "we present a similar discussion in terms of the total velocity of the gas and the angle of its motion relative to our line of sight .",
    "for simplicity we consider an observer at the systemic redshift @xmath265 of the quasar ( but physically distant from it ) with the same line of sight to the quasar as us .",
    "the only difference between such an observer and us is that the wavelengths seen on earth are all a factor of @xmath266 longer .",
    "consider gas moving with speed @xmath140 at an angle @xmath267 to the observer s line of sight in the observer s frame , where @xmath268 and @xmath269 points directly toward the observer ( in other words , the observer looks in the direction @xmath270 to see the gas ) . in its own frame",
    ", such gas will absorb at the rest wavelength of a given transition , @xmath271 . in the observer s frame , those absorbed photons have wavelength @xmath272 following foltz et  al .",
    "( 1986 ) , we rewrite this by defining @xmath273 where @xmath274 . because @xmath275 refers to motion toward the observer ,",
    "a negative line - of - sight velocity @xmath276 indicates motion toward the observer .",
    "redshifted absorption ( @xmath277 ) can be produced by gas moving at relatively low velocity more or less directly away from the observer ( @xmath278 ) .",
    "it can also be produced by gas moving purely in the plane of the sky ( @xmath279 ) with @xmath280 .",
    "that is the relativistic doppler effect : due to time dilation , gas moving transversely in the observer s frame absorbs at a lower frequency ( longer wavelength ) than stationary gas ( figure [ figrel ] ) .",
    "as there is nothing singular about @xmath279 , redshifted absorption can also be produced by gas moving in directions @xmath275 ( toward the observer ) as long as @xmath47 is large enough that in the observer s frame the blueshifted velocity of the absorbing gas is counteracted by its increased time dilation .",
    "absorption at the rest wavelength of a transition can be produced by gas at rest .",
    "it can not be produced by gas moving away from the observer .",
    "however , absorption at the rest wavelength can be produced by gas moving toward the observer at any @xmath48 , provided that the gas moves at an angle @xmath281    blueshifted absorption can only be produced by gas moving toward the observer ( @xmath282 ) .",
    "for any given @xmath283 , there is a minimum @xmath267 at which gas can be moving and still produce absorption at @xmath284 : @xmath285    however , for any @xmath286 , there are _ two _ values of @xmath48 which yield absorption at the same @xmath287 . consider gas moving at a given @xmath286 and photons with @xmath288 .",
    "for @xmath289 just below unity , relatively low - velocity gas ( for which time dilation is negligible ) can absorb those photons when its motion redshifts them to the rest wavelength of the transition in the absorbing gas frame .",
    "extremely high - velocity gas can also absorb those photons because the highly blueshifted velocity of the absorbing gas in the observer s frame is counteracted by its large time dilation . for smaller @xmath289 ,",
    "there continue to be two velocities of @xmath48 at which absorption will occur , but time dilation is not negligible for either of them . only for @xmath269",
    "does this effect vanish .    as a final aside",
    ", we note that detections of relativistic quasar outflows via highly ionized x - ray absorption troughs , both broad and narrow , have been reported over the past decade ( e.g. , chartas et  al .",
    "2009 ; kaspi & behar 2010 ; tombesi et  al .",
    "while the significance of narrow x - ray absorption line detections has been questioned , in part due to their variability between different observations ( vaughan & uttley 2008 ) , strong variability would be natural for such high - velocity outflows and has been observed in mrk  766 ( risaliti et  al .",
    "furthermore , an additional potential source of variability is that if the outflow varies in @xmath218 even at fixed @xmath48 , @xmath287 will vary .",
    "lastly , a given ratio of observed energy to rest energy ( @xmath290 ) for such an outflow yields a maximum angle it can have to the line of sight , which may be a useful constraint for models of such outflows ."
