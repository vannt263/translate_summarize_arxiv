    "driven interfaces in random media display intriguing scaling laws that are common to a wide variety of phenomena , including fluid imbibition , crack front roughening , dislocation hardening , superconducting flux lines , the equilibrium motion of piles of rice down an incline , and domain wall motion in magnets  @xcite .",
    "the scaling laws are commonly associated with an underlying depinning critical point that has been elucidated by simple models for interface dynamics .",

    "one studies the rescaling of the correlation function directly , @xmath10 . these systems are multi - affine  @xcite : different moments of @xmath9 will scale with different exponents . ) here @xmath1 should be uniquely determined by which universality class the system belongs to .",
    "however , in practice , the observed @xmath1 varies ( see table  [ table : roughness ] ) even for the same type of system , such as paper wetting .",
    "measuring a single exponent for these systems may prove inadequate due to the presence of _ crossover behavior _ between universality classes .",
    "this is a common source of confusion and controversy .",
    "if the crossover is gradual , an experiment or simulation may measure an effective exponent @xmath11 intermediate between existing theories , and appear to demand a new theoretical explanation ( _ i.e. _ , universality class ) .",

    ", we shall not only generate universal _ two - variable _ functional forms for the correlation crossover scaling function , but will be able to make predictions about both the dependence of the crossover length scale ( corresponding to @xmath20 ) and the dependence of the correlation amplitude ( corresponding to @xmath27 ) on the control parameters . a rich , nuanced understanding of the model behavior thus emerges .",

    "it is known  @xcite that this restoring force does not produce loop corrections to the renormalization group equations and therefore does not change the universality class of the problem .",
