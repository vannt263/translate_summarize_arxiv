    "even if we are still lacking a quantum theory of gravitational phenomena we are starting to accumulate interesting partial results which will probably be important bits of the final theory . these are , among others , the conformal anomaly induced effective action , which was first written down in @xcite ; the low energy corrections to the newtonian gravitational potential analyzed in @xcite ; the possible ultraviolet ( uv ) finite completion of the theory described in the asymptotic safety scenario @xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to show how these different aspects can all be seen as arising from different terms in the gravitational effective action when this is expanded in powers of the curvature .",
    "in particular , the uv properties of the theory are related to the zero and first order terms , i.e. to the renormalization of newton s and cosmological constants , and to the renormalization of the coupling constants of all higher order local invariants ; quantum gravitational corrections to the newtonian potential are encoded in the finite part of the curvature square terms , while the conformal anomaly induced effective action is just one of the possible four curvature structures .",
    "we will use the effective average action formalism to obtain the gravitational effective action induced by @xmath1 massless scalar fields , @xmath2 massless dirac spinors and @xmath3 abelian gauge fields , interacting solely with the background geometry , as the result of the integration of the rg flow . in the large @xmath0 expansion",

    "this point of view has been analyzed in @xcite , where the focus was on the local part of the effective average action and on the related renormalizability issues . here",
    "we will extend the large @xmath0 analysis to a non - local truncation of effective average action where this is expanded in powers of the curvature .",

    "the beta functions ( [ 11.2 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) agree with those obtained in @xcite .",

    "to make ( [ 18.1 ] ) finite in the continuum limit , i.e. in the limit @xmath96 , we need to renormalize newton s constant ; this can be done by imposing the following condition : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a constant that we will determine later . solving ( [ 18.2 ] ) with respect to bare newton s constant @xmath99 gives : @xmath100 which shows how we need to choose @xmath99 to approach @xmath101 , as @xmath96 , in order that the lhs of ( [ 18.2 ] ) remains constant .",
    "inserting now ( [ 18.2 ] ) in ( [ 18.1 ] ) gives the functional form of the @xmath12-dependent newton s constant:@xmath102 equations ( [ 18.3 ] ) and ( [ 18.4 ] ) are formally the same at the level of the approximation we are considering but have different physical meanings : the first equation tells us how the bare coupling changes as we vary the uv scale @xmath85 , while the second equation shows how the @xmath12-dependent coupling flows as we integrate more and more degrees of freedom by lowering the rg scale @xmath12 . from ( [ 18.4 ] ) we see that the dimensionful newton s constant , @xmath103 , reaches the following renormalized value at @xmath76 : @xmath104 which fixes the value of the constant introduced ( [ 18.2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , we obtain the following relation between the @xmath12-dependent , fixed point and bare cosmological constants : @xmath105 after we impose the uv renormalization condition:@xmath106 which can be solved for the bare cosmological constant : @xmath107 we obtain the @xmath12-dependent cosmological constant : @xmath108 as before , ( [ 18.7 ] ) and ( [ 18.71 ] ) are formally equivalent",
    ". the renormalized value of the dimensionful cosmological constant @xmath109 is obtained from ( [ 18.71 ] ) and shows that @xmath110 . since both @xmath42 and @xmath41 are relevant parameters in the uv ( they are both attracted by the non - gaussian fixed point ) we need to fix their value from experiments , i.e. we need to measure @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the phase diagram obtained by plotting equations ( [ 18.4 ] ) and ( [ 18.71 ] ) is shown in fig . 1 ; we can clearly see that all flow trajectories reach the ir without any obstruction , a feature that is not yet present in the analogous rg flows that include also gravitational fluctuations @xcite .",
    "note that the dimensionless product @xmath113 is independent of the arbitrary scale @xmath94 , thus @xmath114 is a true ir numerical prediction associated to a given rg trajectory .",

    "next we can integrate the beta functions ( [ 15 ] ) for the couplings @xmath122 .",
    "these couplings have only the gaussian fixed point , at least within the approximation we are considering @xcite .",
    "this is easily done : @xmath123 where @xmath124 stands for any of the couplings @xmath122 and where the relative constants @xmath125 can be read - off from ( [ 15 ] ) .",

    "note also that if we were employing a different cutoff shape function @xmath78 than the one employed here , we would had found a different form for the flow for @xmath75 but , as was shown in the two dimensional case @xcite , the @xmath14 limit would had always been equal to ( [ 28 ] ) .    in ( [ 28 ] ) the only contribution to the renormalized ricci structure function @xmath146 comes from the scalar fields and this contributions vanishes if we consider conformally invariant scalars by setting @xmath8 . even if @xmath8 the functional ( [ 28 ] ) is not conformally invariant .",
    "this happens because we are considering an ansatz of the effective average action structured as in ( [ 4 ] ) , which by construction can not accommodate a conformally invariant limit for @xmath76 since the expansion we are performing is not so .",

    "it is important to note that a conformal variation of ( [ 28 ] ) , when @xmath8 , will generate the anomaly term proportional to @xmath149 with the correct coefficient ( see equation ( [ 45 ] ) ) .",
    "this fact has already been noticed by several authors @xcite , in particular the second authors consider this a genuine anomaly term in contrast to the expectation that effective action proposed in @xcite is the only one that produces the conformal anomaly upon variation @xcite . since these first authors obtained the form ( [ 28 ] ) by a flat space calculation , we can think of them to be in the same position as we are in our calculation : the non - conformally invariant form , and thus anomalous term , is what remains of a truly conformally invariant term of the form ( [ 29 ] ) that reduces to a non - invariant term when , to be able to perform calculations , an expansion that brakes conformal symmetry is performed .",
    "this point of view can compose the different expectation expressed on one side by @xcite and on the other side by @xcite and thus deserves further study .    a physical reason to expect a term like ( [ 28 ] ) in the effective action , at second order in the curvatures , is that it generates the quantum gravitational corrections to newton s gravitational potential .",
    "these corrections can be obtained along the lines of @xcite and are the following : @xmath150n_{0}+24n_{\\frac{1}{2}}+48n_{1}}{180\\pi}\\right)\\frac{g_{0}}{r^{2}}\\right\\ } \\,.\\label{30}\\ ] ] the first part of the quantum gravitational correction in ( [ 30 ] ) is the purely gravitational one found in @xcite . as explained in this last reference , the correction ( [ 30 ] )",
    "is equivalent to the one obtained using effective field theory arguments .",
    "note that every field species ( even conformally invariant matter ) gives a positive contribution , of the same form of the purely gravitational one . from ( [",
    "30 ] ) we can see that when the number of massless matter fields @xmath0 grows large , their contributions soon dominate the purely gravitational contribution .",
    "in the last two sections we explicitly derived and integrated the rg flow of the gravitational effective average action to second order in the curvature expansion . in this section",
    "we now look at the third and fourth order terms .",
    "one can consider the curvature cube terms in the effective average action ansatz ( [ 4 ] ) and can project their flow by employing in ( [ 2 ] ) the non - local heat kernel expansion to third order @xcite .",
    "there are now ten independent running structure functions and the curvature expansion of the effective average action has the following form : @xmath151\\right|_{\\mathcal{r}^{3}}=\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\int d^{d}x\\sqrt{g}\\ , f_{i , k}(\\delta_{1},\\delta_{2},\\delta_{3})\\mathcal{r}_{1}\\mathcal{r}_{2}\\mathcal{r}_{3}(i)\\,,\\label{40}\\ ] ] where the curvature structures @xmath152 are given in @xcite .",
    "for example @xmath153 , @xmath154 and so on ; following the conventions of @xcite the laplacians @xmath155 act only on the curvatures @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",
    "the third order terms on the rhs of the flow equation ( [ 2 ] ) can now be written as : @xmath158\\right|_{\\mathcal{r}^{3}}=\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}ds\\,\\tilde{h}_{k}(s)\\ , s^{\\alpha_{i}-1}\\int d^{d}x\\sqrt{g}\\ , f_{i}(s\\delta_{1},s\\delta_{2},s\\delta_{3})\\mathcal{r}_{1}\\mathcal{r}_{2}\\mathcal{r}_{3}(i)\\,,\\label{41}\\ ] ] where the explicit form of the non - local heat kernel structure functions @xmath159 can be obtained from those given in @xcite . since the curvature structures @xmath152 may contain covariant derivatives , third order terms are proportional to different powers of @xmath23 . in fact we have @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 . by comparing ( [ 40 ] ) to ( [ 41 ] ) we obtain the flow equations for the third order running structure functions : @xmath164 where we introduced the scheme dependent functions : @xmath165 where @xmath166 for @xmath157 . at this order",
    ", computations become increasingly hard and it seems rather difficult to straightforwardly evaluate the @xmath23 integrals on the rhs of ( [ 43 ] ) , even is we employ the optimized cutoff shape function @xmath167 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if one employes this cutoff shape function , the couplings of the cubic and higher invariants , i.e. @xmath168 , have zero beta functions . with this cutoff choice",
    ", we need to uv renormalize only the couplings we already considered at lower order of the curvature expansion . in spite of this , the structure functions @xmath169 are non - zero even if they have a vanishing taylor expansion around the origin ( since @xmath170=0 $ ] for all @xmath1711 ) , probably they are proportional to theta functions as are the second order functions @xmath134 ( [ 13 ] ) . for this reason no uv divergencies arise when we integrate the flow equation ( [ 43 ] ) and we find a finite result for the renormalized third order structure functions : @xmath172 in ( [ 44 ] ) we imposed the uv boundary conditions @xmath173",
    ". the absence of uv divergencies can also be understood by looking at the local expansion of the gravitational effective average action where , as we just noticed , the dimensionful beta functions turn out to be zero @xmath174 , thus implying @xmath175 where @xmath176 are the dimensionless coupling with @xmath177 .",
    "thus in the limit @xmath96 is finite and we have @xmath178 .",
    "we finally obtain the cubic curvature part of the gravitational effective action @xmath179\\right|_{\\mathcal{r}^{3}}$ ] when we re - insert ( [ 44 ] ) into ( [ 40 ] ) .",
    "it will be interesting to extend the curvature expansion to the next ( quartic ) order in the curvatures , since the conformal anomaly induced effective action is of this order @xcite .",
    "this effective action is usually obtained by integrating the conformal anomaly ; for the field content we are considering and for @xmath8 this is the following : @xmath180\\,.\\label{45}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to derive ( [ 45 ] ) one uses the relation @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the hessian of ( [ 1 ] ) and the @xmath183 are the relative local heat kernel coefficients .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the following effective action has an energy - momentum tensor whose trace reproduces ( [ 45 ] ) : @xmath184 & = & \\frac{1}{8(4\\pi)^{2}}\\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{g}\\left[\\frac{n_{0}+6n_{\\frac{1}{2}}+12n_{1}}{60}c^{2}\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ &   & \\left.-\\frac{n_{0}+11n_{\\frac{1}{2}}+62n_{1}}{360}\\left(e+\\frac{2}{3}\\delta r\\right)\\right]\\frac{1}{\\delta_{4,0}}\\left(e+\\frac{2}{3}\\delta r\\right)\\,,\\label{46}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath185 is the conformal covariant fourth - order operator acting on conformal invariant scalars .",
    "the conformal anomaly induced effective action ( [ 45 ] ) will constitute , together with other conformally invariant terms , the four curvature terms in the curvature expansion of the effective action .",
    "but since to quartic order in the curvatures we do nt even know the form of the non - local heat kernel expansion , any calculation along the lines of the previous sections is , for the moment , a very hard task to perform . in spite of this",
    "we believe that the integration of the flow of the effective average action will generate the non - local effective action ( [ 45 ] ) as one of the many fourth order terms . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that this is indeed what happens in the analogous two dimensional case .",
    "as a first step toward understanding the gravitational effective action we studied the effective action induced by massless matter fields interacting solely with the background geometry .",
    "we proposed an expansion of the effective action in powers of the curvatures and we showed how various known results about quantum gravity could be seen as arising from different terms of it .",
    "we showed that asymptotic safety and uv renormalization are related to the running of the couplings of local curvature invariants , the first of these being the cosmological and newton s constants .",
    "then we derived the quantum gravitational corrections to the newtonian potential from the quadratic curvature terms and we explained that all other quantum gravitational effects , including those induced by the conformal anomaly are contained in the higher order contributions .",
    "once matter contributions are well understood , one can infer something about the gravitational effective action when matter contributions become dominant in the large @xmath0 limit . when instead gravitational fluctuations become large , we must consider the fact that gravity may actively reacts to matter inducing corrections to the effective action that may be of the same order as those induced by matter .",
    "the exact solution of two dimensional quantum gravity shows that this is indeed what happens in the two dimensional case @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to extend this work and the program started in @xcite to the treatment of full gravitational dynamics .",
