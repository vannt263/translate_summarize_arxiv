    "ever since the discovery of the quantum hall effect , there has been a growing interest in topological properties in certain quantum condensed - matter systems , especially when a model of the topological states in the absence of applied magnetic fields was constructed.@xcite recently , a new topological state of matter in two dimensions , the quantum spin hall insulator ( qshi ) , was theoretically proposed in various systems with time - reversal symmetry and spin - orbit interactions.@xcite the hallmark of the topological nature in qshis is the presence of a bulk gap together with gapless edge states.@xcite these edge states propagate in opposite directions for opposite spins , and thus are usually dubbed as the helical liquids.@xcite the stability of the helical liquid against the elastic backscattering is protected by the time - reversal invariance@xcite ; hence , the helical liquid forms a distinctive feature of this new topological state of matter .",
    "this state occurs in hgte / cdte quantum well structures,@xcite and there has already been experimental evidence in transport properties of helical liquids , which may be considered as the confirmation of these unique one - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) system.@xcite    in the presence of electron - electron interactions , these helical edge states form a special type of luttinger liquid ( ll ) , the helical ll , in which the spins are associated with the directions of the momenta.@xcite therefore , it is interesting both theoretically and experimentally to look for the unique signatures of helical lls and , in particular , to distinguish them from the the usual lls .",
    "recently , it was proposed in refs . that a four - terminal quantum point contact ( qpc ) in the qshi can be used as a probe of the helical ll . in particular , in ref . , it was noted that the problem of the qpc in a qshi can be mapped onto the model of a spinful ll with a weak tunneling link .",
    "the corresponding ll parameter of the charge mode @xmath1 is the inverse of that of the spin mode @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the edge states of the qshi with a tunnel junction can realize phases which can not exist for the spin - su(2 ) invariant ll with a single impurity where @xmath3 there.@xcite it was further shown in ref . that there exists a quantum critical point which can be tuned by adjusting the value of the gate voltage.@xcite as a result",
    ", the low temperature zero - bias conductance can be described by a universal scaling function of the temperature and the gate voltage .",
    "later , a duality relation between the charge and spin sectors in such a four - terminal setup was found in the nonequilibrium situation.@xcite        it is important to notice that in determining the phase diagram of the qpc in a qshi , the two - particle scattering processes , which are naively regarded as less relevant than the single - particle one , play an important role .",
    "it is therefore interesting and important to realize a direct experimental probe of these two - particle scattering processes .",
    "one way to achieve this goal is to analyze the current noise of the tunnel junction .",
    "a pioneering work along this direction has been done recently in ref . .",
    "there , via the cumulant generating function , the nonequilibrium spin - resolved tunnel current and its correlations at zero frequency are obtained by the perturbation theory in the tunneling strength .",
    "particularly , the competition between the single - particle and the two - particle scattering processes has already been seen in the zero - frequency tunnel current noise .",
    "further , fermionic hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) correlations between spin - up and spin - down tunnel currents are also examined in the same work , and it is shown that only the two - particle tunnelings contribute to the hbt correlations .",
    "on the other hand , it was argued in the study of the noise measurement in the edge states of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) liquid that more information can be extracted from the noise correlations of the currents in the terminals than from the noise in the tunnel current flowing through the junction.@xcite in particular , fractional charge quasi - particle excitations have been suggested@xcite and measured@xcite in transport through fqh liquids ( or chiral lls ) as well as in the nonchiral lls.@xcite recently , it has been proposed that fractional charge quasi - particle excitations induced by electron interactions exist and may be probed in the helical edge states of the qshi.@xcite it is therefore of great interest and fundamental importance to investigate further this issue which is relatively less studied .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the zero - frequency shot noise , it has been suggested that even more information is stored in the finite - frequency current noise , such as the quantum statistics of the quasi - particle excitations,@xcite the dynamics of correlations,@xcite and the role of electron interactions .    motivated by these observations , in the present work",
    ", we investigate the current noise of two weakly coupled helical lls in a generic four - terminal setup in the presence of a finite bias @xmath4 between the top and bottom edges of the point contact when it is open , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hlpc1 ] .",
    "in particular , we extend the earlier studies on the zero - frequency tunnel current noise in ref . in two directions .",
    "first , instead of studying the correlations of the tunnel current directly , we investigate currents in the four terminals and the associated noise spectra .",
    "second , instead of just calculating the noise spectrum at zero frequency , we also obtain the noise spectra at finite frequency . as we mentioned above",
    ", there is certain important physical information about this system , which is not probed directly by the tunnel current noise at zero frequency , that can be revealed through this approach . in particular , we show that the fano factor obtained through the correlations of the currents in the terminals will depend on the ll parameter in a way exhibiting the fractional charge carried by the elementary excitations in the helical ll .",
    "therefore , in addition to reproducing some results of ref . , our work may provide a complementary point of view on the physics of the helical ll in such a four - terminal setup .    throughout this work",
    ", we assume that our system is far away from the quantum critical point so that the perturbative calculation becomes reliable .",
    "further , when the point contact is pinched off , the corresponding noise spectra can be obtained by an appropriate duality transformation.@xcite our main results obtained via the keldysh perturbation theory@xcite are shown in figs .",
    "[ hli2][fano02 ] . naively , the two - particle scattering processes seem to be more irrelevant than the single - particle one .",
    "however , we find that the current and noise spectrum may be dominated by them , depending on the value of the ll parameter,@xcite as shown in figs .",
    "[ hli2 ] - [ hls21 ] . to reveal the competition between the single - particle and the two - particle scattering processes clearly",
    ", we calculate the fano factors for the auto- and cross correlations of currents in the terminals .",
    "we find that they depend on the ll parameter and the relative strength of the tunneling processes , which can also be viewed as an indirect probe on the possible fractional charges in a helical liquid .",
    "what we find here is quite different from the corresponding one for tunneling between chiral edge states in the quantum hall liquid.@xcite moreover , the fano factors for the auto- and cross correlations approach different values in the zero - bias limit , depending on the ll parameter .",
    "as we discuss below , this result follows from the entanglement of the right and left movers in the final states for different scattering processes .",

( [ u11 ] ) and ( [ u12 ] ) as @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the charge state in which the left and the right movers carry charge @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively . both the above expressions can be understood as the consequence of fractionalization of charge upon its injection into a ll as discussed in ref . .    in one spatial dimension , the current fluctuations amount to the measurement of charge fluctuations .",
    "accordingly , we get @xmath160 when the @xmath37 term dominates , while for the @xmath39 term being dominant , @xmath119 is proportional to a @xmath118-independent constant . from the above analysis",
    ", we see that the dependence of @xmath138 on the ll parameter @xmath118 follows from the fact that the final state of the single - particle scattering is an entangled state of the left- and the right - mover carrying fractional charge @xmath161 . on the other hand ,",
    "the classical schottky result arises from the final state of the two - particle scattering , which is a direct product state of the left and the right mover both carrying charge @xmath43 .",
    "( this state is not a direct product state of the single - electron states because here the left- and the right - mover carry fractional spins , @xmath162 in units of @xmath163 . ) at finite bias , both the @xmath37 and the @xmath39 terms will contribute to the current and the current noise so that the fano factor depends on the ratio @xmath122",
    ".    we may now compare our results with the main results in ref . .",
    "first of all , in terms of current conservation , that is , @xmath164 , we can obtain the tunnel current noise at finite frequency : @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 is given by eq .",
    "( [ jt1 ] ) . inserting eqs .",
    "( [ hls1 ] ) and ( [ hls2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ jt2 ] ) , we find that @xmath168 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to @xmath169 . equation ( [ jt22 ] ) can also be obtained by a direction calculation using @xmath167 defined in eq .",
    "( [ jt1 ] ) .",
    "the zero - frequency limit , @xmath170 , coincides with the result in ref .",
    "( 21 ) of ref . ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that although we may obtain the total tunnel current noise in ref . from our @xmath62 ,",
    "the reverse is not true .",
    "this is simply because the currents in the four terminals , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 , can not be expressed by the tunnel currents @xmath175 and @xmath176 , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 are spin - up and spin - down tunnel currents , respectively .",
    "the other way to see the difference between the two approaches can be seen from the fano factor for the tunnel current , which is defined as @xmath177 . to @xmath169 ,",
    "we have @xmath178 leading to @xmath179 in the zero - bias limit .",
    "we see that the fano factor in the zero - bias limit @xmath180 , corresponding to the effective quasiparticle charge transporting in the tunneling process , exhibits the classical schottky result : for the single - particle - process - dominated region ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath181 ( corresponding to charge @xmath182 ) , whereas for the region dominated by the two - particle process ( @xmath104 ) , @xmath183 ( corresponding to charge 2@xmath182 ) . this must be the case since only electrons can tunnel between the two edges .",
    "by contrast , the currents in the terminals consist of quasiparticles which may carry fractional charge ; the fano factors for the currents in the terminals can therefore be used to detect the fractionally charged elementary excitations in the helical ll , as discussed .",
    "hence , our work contains unique information about the nature of the fractional charge elementary excitations of the helical edge states , which is not seen in the tunnel current noises as studied in ref . .",
    "on the other hand , as shown in ref . , the cross correlation between the spin - up and spin - down tunnel currents can be used to study the fermionic hbt correlations . since the currents @xmath59 studied here are not spin - resolved ,",
    "our present results can not be used to address such an issue , and it is beyond the scope of our present work .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the case of tunneling between the chiral lls , the fano factor takes the classical schottky result.@xcite in the present case , however , the fano factor is a function of the ll parameter @xmath118 even in the absence of the two - particle tunneling .",
    "similar results also occur for tunneling into a nanotube.@xcite hence , our work offers a way to distinguish the spin-@xmath15 ll from the chiral ll .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that , as noticed in ref . , there exists a duality relation between the cc and the ii limits .",
    "therefore , the noise spectrum in the ii limit in the presence of a bias between the left and right edges can be obtained from our results by interchanging the ll parameters of the charge and spin modes , that is , @xmath184 .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the current and the noise spectrum of a four - terminal qpc in the qshi at finite bias .",
    "special emphasis is put on the fractional charge quasiparticle excitations shown in the noise correlations of the currents in the terminals ( in contrast to the tunneling current noise spectrum ) and examining how the single - particle and the two - particle scattering processes compete with each other . via the keldysh perturbative approach",
    ", we obtained noise spectra of the currents in the terminals , which are , in general , sensitive to the ratios of the tunneling strength and consist of terms exhibiting power law in bias voltage @xmath4 with the exponents determined from the scaling dimension of each scattering process .",
    "we find that both auto- and cross correlations of the noise spectra @xmath93 are sensitive to the positions of the probe with an overall oscillatory behavior .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath93 exhibits singularities at @xmath97 and @xmath95 , corresponding to the single - particle and the two - particle scattering processes , respectively .",
    "it is a unique feature of the helical ll that the two - particle scattering process dominates the electrical transport at low bias in some parameter regime .",
    "the observation of the corresponding singularity in the finite - frequency noise spectra is a direct probe of this mechanism .",
    "in addition to revealing the main characteristics of the current correlations at finite frequency , we also point out the difference between the noise spectra of the helical ll and the chiral ll .",
    "the correlations between the currents in the terminals studied in this paper furnish us with important information about the fractionally charged elementary excitations in the helical ll .",
    "in particular , we find from the fano factors of the currents in the terminals that the fractional charge excitations show up in the single - particle scattering dominated regime ( @xmath96 ) , whereas the classical schottky result is obtained in the two - particle scattering dominated regime ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "we provide further analytical understanding of these results via the idea of charge fractionalization in lls with an electron injection as shown in refs . .",
    "note that this information can not be extracted from the previous study on the tunnel current noise.@xcite in fact , we have calculated the fano factor @xmath185 , corresponding to the effective charge transporting through the junction , and found that the result in the zero - bias limit is nothing but the classical schottky result for both the single - particle- and the two - particle - tunneling - process - dominated regimes .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to our results for the fano factors of the currents in the terminals .",
    "therefore , our results offer a useful guide for the experimental identification of the helical ll , and thus the interaction effects in the qshi .",
    "recently we became aware of the work by souquet and simon ,  @xcite which has partial overlap with the present work .",
    "the finite - frequency tunneling current noise was calculated , and both singularities associated with the one - particle ( @xmath186 ) and the two - particle ( @xmath187 ) processes were also found in their results .    the works of y .- w .",
