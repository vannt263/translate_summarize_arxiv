    "circumstellar dust disks around nearby stars provide strong indirect evidence for the existence of planetesimals in exosolar systems .",
    "radiation pressure , poynting - robertson drag , collisions , and sublimation remove dust orbiting young main sequence stars on timescales 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 times shorter than the stellar ages @xcite . therefore we infer that larger parent bodies exist and replenish dust in the same way that comets and asteroids resupply interplanetary grains in the solar system .",
    "we expect that an undisturbed system of many bodies orbiting a star will have an axially symmetric distribution . over large ( 10@xmath1 au ) scales , however , the northeast ( ne ) side of the @xmath0 pic disk is not a mirror image of the southwest ( sw ) side @xcite .",
    "beginning at @xmath3200 au ( 10 \" ) projected radius , the ne disk extension is brighter , longer , and thinner than the sw extension by roughly 20% .",
    "asymmetry is also evident in the disk vertical height ; in the sw the disk height is greater north of the midplane than to the south , whereas the opposite is true in the ne extension .",
    "the timescale for smoothing such asymmetries is controlled by the orbital period , and it is therefore short relative to the age of the star . hence the observed asymmetries must be young .    gravitational perturbation by a brown dwarf companion @xcite or a close stellar flyby @xcite has been suggested as one possible mechanism for generating large - scale disk asymmetry .",
    "however , no stellar object physically associated with @xmath0 pic has yet been identified .",
    "the key problem in identifying a candidate perturber near @xmath0 pic is that the star is bright ( @xmath4=+3.8 mag ) .",
    "even when we artificially eclipse @xmath0 pic using a coronagraph , spurious instrumental features that resemble both stars and extended objects dominate optical images .",
    "however , data obtained at different telescopes with different instruments have different instrumental noise signatures .",
    "we therefore search for the faintest real objects in @xmath0 pic s field using optical data from multiple telescopes and instruments .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observational data for @xmath0 pic . the hubble space telescope ( hst ) archive data consist of wfpc2 ccd images with the @xmath0 pic disk oriented along either the planetary camera ( pc ) or the wide field cameras ( wfc ) .",
    "the ground - based observations and data reduction techniques are described in earlier work @xcite . here",
    "we note that sensitivity to faint objects is hampered by @xmath0 pic s bright point spread function ( psf ) and light from the circumstellar dust disk itself .",
    "both are subtracted using template stars and/or idealized model fits that are detailed in @xcite .",
    "subtraction of a smooth , symmetric ( axially and vertically ) model disk reveals a brightness enhancement along the ne extension of the disk midplane 785 au from the star ( feature a ; fig . 1 ; table 2 ) . four field stars common to every",
    "data set are utilized for image registration and astrometry , and the feature is confirmed in every data set ( except the hst pc images , which lack a suitable field of view ) .",
    "we do not detect a similar brightness enhancement anywhere between 25 `` and 41 '' radius on the sw side of the disk .",
    "feature a is unlikely to be a background galaxy because it is amorphous in the unbinned hst images , and appears extended along the position angle of the disk .",
    "the ne disk midplane has several more brightness enhancements between 25 `` and 40 '' with a degree of positional correlation not present in brightness knots in the field or sw of the star ( fig .",
    "1 ; table 2 ) .",
    "the centroids of features f and g are spatially correlated to within 0.5 `` in the highest resolution images obtained with hst and the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope .",
    "the morphologies and positions of feature centroids vary due to instrumental noise , sub - pixel registration differences between the observed disk and the idealized model disk , and the number of pixels binned to form a final image .",
    "experiments with the data reduction techniques show that the latter two effects can shift centroids by 1 pixel , which is equivalent to 0.4''-0.6 \" .",
    "these uncertainties are evident even for the highest signal - to - noise detection , feature a ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we identify four more brightness enhancements ( b , c , d , e ; fig .",
    "1 ) that appear spatially correlated within these uncertainties .",
    "we expect that more sensitive , high resolution observations dedicated to imaging this portion of the disk will help establish the exact number of knots and their positions .",
    "brightness knots near and within the sw disk extension are uncorrelated and can be attributed to noise .    table 2 gives the measured positions and surface brightnesses of the seven features .",
    "basic characteristics of the midplane structure are : a ) feature a at @xmath5 `` ( 785 au ) radius is resolved and extended by @xmath34 '' ( @xmath380 au ) , b ) feature a shows the greatest enhancement over the mean midplane surface brightness ( i.e. displays the greatest contrast ) , c ) the spacing between features generally increases with increasing radius , d ) the sw disk midplane does not contain comparable features .",
    "we interpret the observed features as dust density enhancements along the projected disk midplane.24 mag ) objects detected in the entire unobstructed field of view , there is a @xmath33% chance that one of the disk features is due to a background galaxy . ]",
    "the density enhancements may represent discrete clouds of dust produced by random planetesimal collisions , or a ring system system viewed edge - on .",
    "we reason that if random planetesimal collisions were important , then we would observe density enhancements on the sw side of the disk also . because density enhancements are absent in the sw midplane ,",
    "the random collisions mechanism may be insignificant , though future work should perform quantitative tests .    here",
    "we explore the validity of a ring model to explain the midplane density enhancements .",
    "we assume that the multiple features along the ne midplane represent nested eccentric rings viewed close to edge - on .",
    "the absence of comparable features to the sw of @xmath0 pic means that the rings are not centered on the star .",
    "the well ordered nature of the system of bright features over a radial scale @xmath3300 au may be indicative of a global restructuring of the planetesimal disc in the recent past .",
    "thus , as a first attempt to explain the origin of such a system , we test how a strong gravitational perturbation , such as from a close stellar flyby , might alter the global morphology of an initially symmetric planetesimal disk .",
    "in addition , we require that the resulting disk morphology qualitatively fits the radial and vertical disk asymmetries known to exist along the same region of the disk as the proposed ring system .",
    "we utilize a standard numerical code radial dependence of surface number density , and a vertically exponential density profile with the disk flared such that the scale height is proportional to @xmath6 . ]",
    "@xcite to follow @xmath7 collisionless test particles that are initialised in circular orbits about a point - mass potential ; this system experiences an encounter with a secondary point - mass that follows a prescribed parabolic trajectory . the key parameters governing the disk response are : the mass ratio , the pericenter distance @xmath8 , and the inclination of pericenter to the initial midplane of the disk @xmath9 .",
    "the test particles are taken to represent the underlying parent bodies that replenish the dust through infrequent collisional disruption .",
    "we assume that the distribution of simulated particles traces the distribution of dust grains that would result from collisions in the real system @xcite .",
    "we find that coplanar encounters distort disk structure near periastron , leading to the development of transient kinematic spiral features .",
    "these are regions of eccentricity growth . within a few disk orbital periods of periastron passage",
    "the spiral patterns collapse into generally eccentric nested rings . if the encounter timescale is sufficiently short , as in relatively close encounters , then one spiral arm dominates the response .",
    "correspondingly , the disk takes on a lopsided appearance @xcite .",
    "after many orbital periods , the ring patterns become incoherent through orbital phase - mixing . inside a radius @xmath10 the tidal influence of the perturber is slight ; outside a radius @xmath11 the interaction rapidly increases in strength @xcite .",
    "similarly , non - coplanar flyby encounters excite inclination changes in the orbits of disk particles @xcite , generating asymmetry about the midplane @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass ratio is taken to be @xmath12 throughout the models presented here .",
    "the perturber therefore has the mass of an m star relative to @xmath0 pic .",
    "however , varying the mass ratio was not found to affect the qualitative outcome significantly compared with varying @xmath8 .",
    "we investigated the induced length asymmetry in the disk as a function of @xmath8 for coplanar encounters . for a broad range of viewing angles ,",
    "the required length asymmetry ( @xmath13 ) is produced at a radius corresponding to the initial size of the disk when @xmath8 is @xmath14 times larger than that value .",
    "we then considered various inclinations , @xmath9 , for the encounter , and compared the resulting isophotal contours with those from observations , for various viewing angles .",
    "figures 2 , 3 , and 4 present the simulation which best reproduces the observational data .",
    "the model disk is seen @xmath15 orbital periods ( at the initial outer radius ) after periastron .",
    "planetesimals have scattered outwards to several times the initial disk radius , and show well - defined ringed structure on one side of the disrupted disk , but not the other , in agreement with the observations ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in the edge - on view",
    ", model disk isophotes qualitatively match the observed asymmetries in length , width , and height above and below the midplane ( fig .",
    "the rings appear as bumps along the disk midplane in the edge - on view , with spacing increasing with radius ( fig .",
    "ring structure inside computational radius 2 has been eliminated by orbital phase mixing , which in the observational data corresponds to radius @xmath3 26 `` ( 500 au ) .",
    "the region of relatively unperturbed particles , @xmath16 , now scales to @xmath3 9 '' , which is consistent with the projected radius where disk asymmetries are observed to begin @xcite .",
    "having determined the length unit we deduce that this model is at a state @xmath17 yr after periastron .",
    "since the removal timescale of dust due to poynting - robertson drag is significantly longer than 10@xmath18 yr @xcite , the distribution of parent bodies will trace the reflecting dust particles , as we initially assumed .",
    "the stellar flyby hypothesis provides a simple explanation for the existence , spacing , and morphology of the brightness maxima along @xmath0 pic s midplane , as well as the large - scale disk asymmetries .",
    "the pumped up velocity dispersion of planetesimals may also lead to increased dust replenishment rates , owing to more frequent and destructive collisions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the large total dust mass around @xmath0 pic compared to that of other main sequence stars probably results from both its youth @xcite and the dynamical state of the system . our model for @xmath0 pic",
    "s recent dynamical history implies that the top panel of fig .",
    "2 approximates the face - on view of the planetesimal disk .    the encounter distance assumed in the simulation scales to @xmath3700 au , implying a statistically unlikely event ( 0.01% chance in 10@xmath19 yr , assuming empirical parameters for the solar neighborhood ; garcia - sanchez et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , if @xmath0 pic formed with a bound stellar companion on a @xmath201000 au radius orbit , and it was the companion that was perturbed by a stellar flyby into a new orbit that disrupted the planetesimal disk , then the flyby probability increases by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the prograde and relatively small angle trajectory of the perturber relative to the disk midplane in our simulation .",
    "ultimately , identification of the perturber is necessary to validate the stellar flyby hypothesis .",
    "future work will present a comprehensive , statistical analysis of the relative space motions and uncertainties for candidate perturbers using hipparcos data @xcite .",
    "we note that the orientation of the outer disk height asymmetry is in the same direction relative to the midplane as the proposed midplane warp imaged @xmath350 au from the star @xcite",
    ". this inner warp could be due to a planet that is inclined relative to the disk midplane @xcite .",
    "the stellar flyby hypothesis offers an alternate explanation for the warp .",
    "the non - coplanar flyby generates planetesimal orbits with increased eccentricity and inclination , which at apastron manifest as the flared disk in the sw extension .",
    "however , as seen in the edge - on projection , this family of vertically scattered planetesimals cross the main disk on their way to periastron at @xmath350 au to the ne of @xmath0 pic ( fig .",
    "2 ) . this intersecting second plane might contaminate isophotes from the quiescent inner disk , giving the appearance of a warped midplane .",
    "hypothetical planets near 50 au radius may also encounter the second plane planetesimals and deliver them to the innermost parts of the system , leading to an enhancement of cometary activity @xcite .",
    "the main effect of the external perturber is to scatter planetesimals from their formation sites outward to greater radii , and vertically away from the midplane .",
    "roughly 10% of the disk mass is actually lost to interstellar space in the simulation presented here.5 km s@xmath21 , in which case they could cover the distance between @xmath0 pic and the sun in @xmath34 myr . ]",
    "this rearrangement of the planetesimal disk was achieved primarily by the gas giant planets during the evolution of the solar system .",
    "however , recent theoretical work links the high eccentricities and inclinations of kuiper belt objects to close stellar flybys with the young sun @xcite .",
    "the current state of the @xmath0 pic system may therefore accurately represent an early evolutionary phase of our solar system .",
