    "although the solutions to ( [ eq : che ] ) are not given explicitly , their approximations can be found using the smallness of @xmath27 @xcite ( largeness of the delays ) @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are real .",

    "hence , in order for the second delay to play the destabilizing role , one needs @xmath128 and @xmath129 becoming positive . by requiring this and substituting ( [ eq : ms ] ) into ( [ eq : che ] ) , one can arrive to the following conditions for the parameters of the system : @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
