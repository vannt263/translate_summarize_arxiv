    "the experimental realization of molecular junctions  @xcite some fifteen years ago has sparked a wave of research activities both in theoretical @xcite and the experimental @xcite communities .",
    "presently , single molecule electronics is considered as a possible potential substitution of the silicon - based elements in the information processing technology  @xcite , and this perspective makes studies of molecular transport properties very appealing . besides the standard current - voltage characteristics  @xcite , it is also possible , for example by use of the full counting statistics  @xcite , to obtain the information about the fluctuations of the electric current flowing through a molecular wire @xcite .",
    "the issue of heat transport across such molecular junctions attracted much less attention in the prior literature .",
    "this may be so because a measurement of heat flow experimentally is far from being a straightforward task .",
    "the problem of heat current constitutes , however , an important physical issue .",
    "this is so because the structural _ stability _ of any molecular structure depends sensitively on the heat flow which accompanies the inter - electrode charge transport .    with the systems of interest being of nanoscale the corresponding heat noise",
    "can also be quite large .",
    "this may be so even in situations where the average heat current is identically _ vanishing _ all together , as it is the case in thermal equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the properties of noise correlation features , or likewise , its frequency - dependent spectral properties and , as well , its zero - frequency power spectrum , are in no way directly related to the mean value of the heat flow itself .",
    "it is thus of outmost interest to gain some insight into the size of heat noise in such molecular wire setups .",
    "in particular , it would be very useful to have analytical estimates for its power spectral density ( psd ) available , even at the expense that these may predominantly apply to idealized setups only .",
    "heat transport across conducting molecular wires , explicitly induced by a difference of the lead temperatures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is a phenomenon which involves electrons , phonons and their mutual interaction  .",
    "therefore , the definition of heat , carried through the wire , should be addressed with care , with the need to distinguish between heat transfer mediated by electrons and a one mediated by phonons .",
    "the latter issue constitutes the realm of _ phononics _",
    "@xcite , a promising novel research area which may lead to new elements , such as molecular thermal diodes , thermal transistors , thermal logic gates , to name but a few  @xcite . here also",
    ", the size of fluctuations in heat current does matter ; this is so because those may well turn out to be deleterious to intended information processing tasks .",
    "energy transport mediated by electrons is a process which is related to its electric current : electrons are moving from lead to lead , carrying not only charge but also energy .",
    "however , the amount of energy carried by a single electron , unlike to its charge , is not constant  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the studies that examine the average heat flow much less attention , however , has been paid to the issue and impact of _ fluctuations _ of heat flow across various nanoscale devices . in some prior work",
    "@xcite the heat transport through a ballistic quantum wire has been considered in the luttinger - liquid limit , by neglecting the discreteness of the wire s energy spectrum . in more recent publications , refs .",
    "@xcite , the psd of the heat current fluctuations has been derived within the scattering theory , under the assumption that the electrons are transmitted ( reflected ) at the same rates , independently of their actual energies .",
    "the results of the last two papers are distinctive because they have shown that the heat noise exhibits a well - pronounced frequency dependence even in the zero - temperature limit .    with this work we consider the _ electronic _ heat current that proceeds across a molecular wire composed of a single energy level with the two leads held at a constant temperature difference .",
    "in doing so we shall neglect electron - phonon interactions and electron - electron interactions .",
    "such a simplification can be justified in situations that involve a short wire .",
    "then , the coulomb interaction via a double occupancy shifts the energy far above the fermi level so that its role for thermal transport can be neglected . likewise , the electron dwell time is very short as compared to the electron - phonon relaxation time scale .",
    "in contrast to prior works @xcite , however , we here take into account the dependence of the transmission coefficient on its electron energies , and , within the nonequilibrium green function approach @xcite , derive an explicit expression for the psd of the heat current fluctuations , @xmath2 . with this result at hand",
    "we explore different regimes of electron transport and demonstrate that the heat noise in fact is quite distinct from its electric counterpart .    in sec .",
    "iii , we evaluate by use of the green function method the expression for both , electronic heat current and its noise .",
    "we study analytically the distinct properties of the electronic heat noise and compare this result with the electronic current noise counterpart . in doing so",
    "we demonstrate that for the chosen setup of a molecular junction with a single molecular energy level different power laws for the psd occur in different frequency regions .",

    "although this distinction seemingly appears minor , it leads to a tangible difference in a dependence of the noise psds on energy level of the wire orbital , as depicted with fig .",
    "[ fig : curnoise ] .",
    "when the orbital level , @xmath53 , is tuned to the chemical potential , the two expressions reveal different properties : while the zero - frequency component of the electric psd at @xmath71 exhibits a maximum at @xmath46 , its heat counterpart possesses a local minimum at this value .",
    "this difference originates from the salient fact that the two transport mechanisms for charge and the energy are not equivalent .",
    "the electric current is quantized by the electron charge , @xmath75 ; in contrast , the energy carried by the electron is not quantized and may assume principally an arbitrary value .",
    "the main contribution to the electron flow across the wire stems from the electrons occupying energy levels around the chemical potential @xmath6 .    because the interaction between the leads and the molecule is weak , it only slightly perturbs the fermi distributions , which possess strongly nonuniform profiles around @xmath25 . electrons of different energies contribute differently to the heat transport , but the fermi distribution allows only for a finite number of electrons per energy level : i.e. just one in case of spinless electrons , or two in the case of electron with spin .",
    "therefore , the electrons of given energy can move across the wire only when the corresponding level of the destination lead can host them .    when @xmath53 deviates from the chemical potential , increasingly less electrons",
    "participate in the transport .",
    "the flow of electrons becomes diminished , and since both , the electric current and the electric noise are insensitive to the electron energies , they both decrease with increasing @xmath76 .",
    "this scenario differs for heat transport : this is so because the deviation from the chemical potential increases the possibility that successive electrons will carry different energies .",
    "this in turn will lead to an increase of heat noise .",
    "with further deviation of the orbital energy from the chemical potential , the occupancy difference decreases monotonically and consequently the heat noise strength decreases again .",
    "next let us focus on the equilibrium properties of heat noise ; i.e. , the situation when the two temperatures are equal , @xmath51 .",
    "in this case the average heat flow vanishes identically , but not its fluctuations .",
    "the zero - frequency spectra of both noises , for heat and electric noise , i.e. the corresponding power spectra increase with the increase of the coupling @xmath78 , since it increases the transmission probability .",
    "the noise intensities are different from zero , however , even at equilibrium , see for heat noise fig .",
    "[ fig : curnoise ] , i.e. , the two panels ( b , d ) .",
    "the properties at vanishing temperature , @xmath64 , are more subtle .",
    "it has been pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite that heat noise seemingly violates the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "in fact , a temperature difference , @xmath79 , does not induce any thermal gradient .",
    "therefore , there is no force which is conjugate to the heat current , and the process is out of the validity region of the fdt .",
    "this ` evasion ' of the fdt is fully active in the zero - temperature limit , @xmath80 , where the heat noise psd still depends on the frequency .",
    "this dependence is due to quantum fluctuations , the virtual transitions of electrons directly from lead- to - lead @xcite .",
    "the fermi distribution equals the heaviside step function in this case .",
    "thus , the contributions to the integrand in eq . comes from the interval @xmath81 $ ] only . after the integration of eq .",

    "this is in full agreement with the results obtained in refs .",

    "introduces a linear cutoff in the limit @xmath85 , @xmath86 . in distinct contrast , in the high - frequency region , the first term in the rhs of eq .",
    "is dominating . as a result",
    "the psd   approaches a square - law asymptotic dependence , @xmath87 , in the high - frequrncy limit , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ze ] .",
    "by using the green function formalism we have investigated electronic heat transport with our focus being the heat flow fluctuations for a setup composed of a single orbital molecular wire . for the noninteracting case we succeeded in deriving a closed form for the frequency dependence of heat current noise ,",
    "i.e. , the heat noise psd , see eq .  , both in nonequilibrium @xmath88 and in thermal equilibrium @xmath51 .",
    "the dependence of the heat noise on the orbital energy @xmath53 is qualitatively different from that for the accompanying electric current noise .",
    "in the zero - temperature limit , the psd of the heat noise obeys two distinctive asymptotic behaviors , being different in the low - frequency and the high - frequency regions .",
    "it is evident that the particular square - law shape of the psd in the high - frequency region is due to the lorentzian shape of the transmission coefficient , @xmath89 . yet",
    "the general effect would remain for any choice of the coefficient in the form of a localized , bell - shaped function : the noise spectrum will deviate from a cubic power - law asymptotic behavior upon entering the high - frequency region .",
    "there is an intriguing perspective to apply an external periodic perturbation with the goal to control the spectral properties of the heat noise , similar to electronic shot - noise control in ac - driven nanoscale conductors @xcite .",
    "this idea can be realized , for example , by subjecting the molecular wire to strong laser radiation @xcite or by using direct modulations of the gate voltage .",
    "we conjecture that the role of laser radiation may give rise to novel phenomena to be explored further by combining a floquet theory for the driven system with the nonequilibrium green function formalism @xcite .",
    "as emphasized in our introduction , with this work only the electron subsystem has been considered .",
    "realistic heat transport in real molecular junctions would involve the complexity of interacting electrons and electron - phonon interactions @xcite . as reasoned in the introduction",
    ", the electronic heat transport may dominate in certain situations so that the measured heat noise can be attributed approximately to the electronic component only .",
    "the unified approach , which would include both the electron and the phonon subsystems , as well as the effects of their interactions , presents a future challenge , although several contributions in this direction for the heat current ( but not the heat psd ) have already been undertaken before @xcite ) .",
