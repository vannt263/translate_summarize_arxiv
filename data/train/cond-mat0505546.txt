    "due to their being a common feature of fluid motion , vortices appear in diverse fields of science . in a superfluid ,",
    "that is , a fluid without viscosity , the flow has quantized circulation which originates in quantized vortices@xcite .",
    "a quantized vortex is commonly viewed as a topological defect of the order parameter in bose - einstein condensation .",
    "since the gradient of the phase of the order parameter is proportional to the superfluid velocity , quantized vortices play a crucial role in understanding superfluidity .",
    "moreover , the structure of the order parameters in multicomponent bose - einstein condensates , hereafter becs , are analogous to other studies including superfluid @xmath0he@xcite , unconventional superconductors@xcite , quantum hall systems@xcite , nonlinear optics@xcite , nuclear physics@xcite , and cosmology@xcite .",
    "therefore , the investigation of unconventional topological defects in such multicomponent becs is of great importance and of broad interest .",
    "while quantized vortices have been extensively studied in the field of superfluid helium@xcite , they have seen a remarkable resurgence of interest since the realization of bose - einstein condensation in dilute alkali - atomic gases@xcite .",
    "this bose - condensed system has some distinct advantages for the study of quantized vortices .",
    "first , the becs of alkali - atomic gases are so dilute that the interatomic interaction can be accurately parametrized in terms of the @xmath1-wave scattering length .",
    "experimentally , the diluteness leads to a relatively large healing length that characterizes the vortex core size , thus enabling us to directly visualize the quantized vortices by optical techniques . also , because the gas is dilute , the gross - pitaevskii equation gives an accurate description of static and dynamic properties of the atomic condensate within a mean - field approximation .",
    "this situation differs from superfluid @xmath2he in which the high density and the strong interaction complicate the theoretical treatments .",
    "second , rapidly developing techniques of atomic , molecular and optical physics allow us to carry out quantum - state engineering of the condensates in a well - controlled manner , thereby opening a new direction for the study of coherent quantum phenomena .",
    "for example , since alkali atoms have internal degrees of freedom attributed to the hyperfine spin , an external field can be used to induce conversions between spin states and thus it can be used to control the spatial variation of the wave functions .",
    "moreover , a field - induced feshbach resonance allows one to tune of the atom - atom interaction and create of a quasi - bound molecular state@xcite .    the first experimental detection of a vortex in a dilute alkali - atomic gas bec was made by matthews _",
    "_ in 1999@xcite .",
    "their study involves condensates of @xmath3rb atoms residing in two hyperfine states .",
    "the generation of a vortex was achieved by a phase imprinting technique proposed by williams and holland@xcite , in which the interconversion between two components was controlled spatially and temporally by an external coupling field . after turning off the coupling , the vortex state is formed by one circulating component surrounding a nonrotating core of the other component .",
    "leanhardt _ et al._@xcite used ",
    "topological phase imprinting\"@xcite to create a vortex in a spin-1 bec .",
    "these two methods use internal degrees of freedom of the condensate to create vortices , but a simple way to create vortices is to stir a condensate mechanically with a rotating  bucket \" . following the latter method ,",
    "the ens group observed the formation of a single vortex and multiple vortices in a single - component elongated condensate@xcite .",
    "the condensate was trapped in a static axisymmetric magnetic trap which was deformed by a nonaxisymmetric attractive dipole potential created with stirring laser beams .",
    "this combined potential produces a cigar - shaped harmonic trap with a slightly anisotropic transverse profile . by rotating the orientation of the transverse anisotropy at frequency @xmath4 , they observed the dynamic formation of a vortex above a certain critical value of @xmath4 . a lattice involving more vortices appeared when @xmath4 was further increased .",
    "in contrast to indirect visualization methods used in superfluid helium systems , the quantized vortices were directly visualized as hollows in the transverse density profile of the time - of - flight image .",
    "later , groups at mit@xcite , jila@xcite , and oxford@xcite observed vortex lattices with the first two groups succeeding in creating 100 or more vortices .    theoretical studies mainly used the mean - field gross - pitaevskii theory to describe the main features of the vortex states ( see ref . for a review ) , and several predictions have been shown to agree with experiments .",
    "some of the important problems are concerned with the equilibrium properties of a single vortex , including its structures and dynamics@xcite@xmath5@xcite , the critical frequency and the surface - mode instability for vortex nucleation@xcite@xmath5@xcite , and the nonlinear dynamics of vortex lattice formation@xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "finally , experiments on a rapidly rotating bec@xcite@xmath5@xcite have motived theoretical studies of collective oscillations of a vortex lattice@xcite@xmath5@xcite , new vortex phases in an anharmonic potential@xcite@xmath5@xcite , and a strongly - correlated fractal quantum hall phase via quantum melting of a vortex lattice@xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "another important issue in vortex physics is to elucidate the vortex phase in multicomponent becs .",
    "multicomponent order parameters allow the formation of various unconventional topological defects with complex properties that arise from interactions between different order - parameter components@xcite . since it is possible to load and cool atoms in more than one hyperfine spin state or more than one atomic element in the same trap , multicomponent condensates",
    "can be realized experimentally@xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "such systems offer an ideal testing ground for the study of such topological defects ; moreover the microscopic characterization of these systems should in principle be possible because this system is free from impurities and well controlled by optical techniques .",
    "in this paper we review recent studies on quantized vortices in multicomponent becs , especially focusing on those in _ two - component becs_. to the best of our knowledge , there are no reviews of two - component becs despite the large number of studies of this system@xcite@xmath5@xcite . also , while a number of interesting phenomena have been reported on vortices of a spin-1 bec , we mention this system only briefly and would like to refer the reader to references - for more details .",

    "<S> we review the topic of quantized vortices in multicomponent bose - einstein condensates of dilute atomic gases , with an emphasis on that in two - component condensates . </S>",
    "<S> first , we review the fundamental structure , stability and dynamics of a single vortex state in a slowly rotating two - component condensates . to understand recent experimental results , we use the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations and the generalized nonlinear sigma model . an axisymmetric vortex state , which was observed by the jila group , can be regarded as a topologically trivial skyrmion in the pseudospin representation . </S>",
    "<S> the internal , coherent coupling between the two components breaks the axisymmetry of the vortex state , resulting in a stable vortex molecule ( a meron pair ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention unconventional vortex states and monopole excitations in a spin-1 bose - einstein condensate . </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss a rich variety of vortex states realized in rapidly rotating two - component bose - einstein condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a phase diagram with axes of rotation frequency and the intercomponent coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> this phase diagram reveals unconventional vortex states such as a square lattice , a double - core lattice , vortex stripes and vortex sheets , all of which are in an experimentally accessible parameter regime . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent coupling leads to an effective attractive interaction between two components , providing not only a promising candidate to tune the intercomponent interaction to study the rich vortex phases but also a new regime to explore vortex states consisting of vortex molecules characterized by anisotropic vorticity . a recent experiment by the jila group vindicated the formation of a square vortex lattice in this system .    </S>",
