    "this document is intended to summarize the potential of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) for high transverse momentum physics and explain the reasons why it is a crucial next step in our understanding of the behavior of nature .",
    "it is the physics potential of the lhc that motivates us participation ; not a desire to build detector components , a need for projects for students or postdocs , or a requirement for a future program to retain university funding ( though these elements may be important ) .",
    "we believe this physics potential enormous and that , among currently approved projects , the lhc is unique in that it is the only one that has sufficient energy and luminosity to probe in detail the energy scale relevant to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we outline the many physics processes that have been studied as part of the design processes for the atlas@xcite and cms@xcite detectors .",
    "examples are selected from the large amount of detailed work carried out for and since the technical proposals .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) is a very successful description of the interactions of the components of matter at the smallest scales ( @xmath0 m ) and highest energies ( @xmath1gev ) accessible to current experiments .",
    "it is a quantum field theory which describes the interaction of spin-@xmath2 , point - like fermions , whose interactions are mediated by spin-1 gauge bosons .",
    "the bosons are a consequence of local gauge invariance applied to the fermion fields and are a manifestation of the symmetry group of the theory , which for the sm is @xmath3 .",
    "the fundamental fermions are leptons and quarks .",
    "the left - handed states are doublets under the @xmath4 group , while the right - handed states are singlets .",
    "there are three generations of fermions , each generation identical except for mass : the origin of this structure , and the breaking of generational symmetry ( flavor symmetry ) remain a mystery .",
    "there are three leptons with electric charge @xmath5 , the electron ( @xmath6 ) , muon ( @xmath7 ) and tau lepton ( @xmath8 ) , and three electrically neutral leptons ( the neutrinos @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "similarly there are three quarks with electric charge @xmath12 , up ( @xmath13 ) , charm ( @xmath14 ) and top ( @xmath15 ) , and three with electric charge @xmath16 , down ( @xmath17 ) , strange ( @xmath18 ) and bottom ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the quarks are triplets under the @xmath20 group and thus carry an additional `` charge , '' referred to as color .",
    "there is mixing between the three generations of quarks , which in the sm is parameterized by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm)@xcite matrix but not explained .    in the sm the @xmath21 symmetry group ( which describes the so - called electroweak interaction ) is spontaneously broken by the existence of a ( postulated ) higgs field with non - zero expectation value",
    "this leads to the emergence of massive vector bosons , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which mediate the weak interaction , while the photon of electromagnetism remains massless .",
    "one physical degree of freedom remains in the higgs sector , which should be manifest as a neutral scalar boson @xmath24 , but which is presently unobserved .",
    "the @xmath20 group describes the strong interaction ( quantum chromodynamics or qcd ) .",
    "eight vector gluons mediate this interaction .",
    "they carry color charges themselves , and are thus self - interacting .",
    "this implies that the qcd coupling @xmath25 is small for large momentum transfers but large for small momentum transfers , and leads to the confinement of quarks inside color - neutral hadrons . attempting to free",
    "a quark produces a jet of hadrons through quark - antiquark pair production and gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the basic elements of the standard model were proposed in the 1960 s and 1970 s @xcite .",
    "increasing experimental evidence of the correctness of the model accumulated through 1970 s and 1980 s :    * slac deep inelastic scattering experiments showed the existence of point - like scattering centers inside nucleons , later identified with quarks @xcite * observation of the @xmath14 and @xmath19 quarks @xcite * observation of neutral weak currents ( @xmath23 exchange)@xcite * observation of jet structure and three - jet final states ( gluon radiation ) in @xmath26 and hadron - hadron collisions@xcite * direct observation of the @xmath27 and @xmath23 at the cern sps collider @xcite    following these discoveries , an era of consolidation has been entered .",
    "ever more precise experiments have been carried out at lep and slc which have provided verification of the couplings of quarks and leptons to the gauge bosons at the level of 1-loop radiative corrections ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the top quark was discovered at fermilab in 1995 , with a very large mass ( @xmath29gev).@xcite    only two particles from the standard model have yet to be observed ; @xmath11 and the higgs boson . of these",
    "the latter is more important as it holds the key to the generation of @xmath27 , @xmath23 , quark and lepton masses .",
    "some of the sm parameters , particularly those of the ckm matrix are not well determined .",
    "experiments over the next few years involving cp violation in the k@xcite and b systems@xcite should determine these parameters or demonstrate the sm can not adequately explain cp violation .",
    "there are some indications that the sm may be incomplete or inadequate in that there are a very few experimental observations that it can not accommodate such as the possibility that neutrino oscillations occur@xcite .",
    "the success of the standard model@xcite of strong ( qcd ) , weak and electromagnetic interactions has drawn increased attention to its limitations . in its simplest version , the model has 19 parameters @xcite , the three coupling constants of the gauge theory @xmath30 , three lepton and six quark masses , the mass of the @xmath23 boson which sets the scale of weak interactions , the four parameters which describe the rotation from the weak to the mass eigenstates of the charge -1/3 quarks ( ckm matrix ) .",
    "all of these parameters are determined with varying errors .",
    "of the two remaining , one , a cp violating parameter associated with the strong interactions , must be very small .",
    "the last parameter is associated with the mechanism responsible for the breakdown the electroweak @xmath21 to @xmath31 .",
    "this can be taken as the mass of the , as yet undiscovered , higgs boson .",
    "the couplings of the higgs boson are determined once its mass is given .",
    "the gauge theory part of the sm has been well tested ; but there is no direct evidence either for or against the simple higgs mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "all masses are tied to the mass scale of the higgs sector . within the model",
    "we have no guidance on the expected mass of the higgs boson .",
    "the current experimental lower bound is 65 gev . as its mass increases , the self couplings and the couplings to the @xmath27 and @xmath23 bosons grow@xcite .",
    "this feature has a very important consequence .",
    "either the higgs boson must have a mass less than about 800 gev or the dynamics of ww and zz interactions with center of mass energies of order 1 tev will reveal new structure .",
    "it is this simple argument that sets the energy scale that must be reached to guarantee that an experiment will be able to provide information on the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the presence of a single elementary scalar boson is distasteful to many theorists .",
    "if the theory is part of some more fundamental theory , which has some other larger mass scale ( such as the scale of grand unification or the planck scale ) , there is a serious `` fine tuning '' or naturalness problem .",
    "radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass result in a value that is driven to the larger scale unless some delicate cancellation is engineered ( @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are order @xmath35 gev or larger ) .",
    "there are two ways out of this problem which involve new physics on the scale of 1 tev .",
    "new strong dynamics could enter that provide the scale of @xmath36 or new particles could appear so that the larger scale is still possible , but the divergences are cancelled on a much smaller scale . in any of the options , standard model , new dynamics or cancellations ,",
    "the energy scale is the same ; something must be discovered on the tev scale .",
    "supersymmetry is an appealing concept for which there is , at present , no experimental evidence@xcite .",
    "it offers the only presently known mechanism for incorporating gravity into the quantum theory of particle interactions and provides an elegant cancellation mechanism for the divergences provided that at the electroweak scale the theory is supersymmetric .",
    "the successes if the standard model ( such as precision electroweak predictions ) are retained , while avoiding any fine tuning of the higgs mass .",
    "some supersymmetric models allow for the unification of gauge couplings at a high scale and a consequent reduction of the number of arbitrary parameters .",
    "supersymmetric models postulate the existence of superpartners for all the presently observed particles : bosonic superpartners of fermions ( squarks @xmath37 and sleptons @xmath38 ) , and fermionic superpartners of bosons ( gluinos @xmath39 and gauginos @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) .",
    "there are also multiple higgs bosons : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "there is thus a large spectrum of presently unobserved particles , whose exact masses , couplings and decay chains are calculable in the theory given certain parameters .",
    "unfortunately these parameters are unknown .",
    "nonetheless , if supersymmetry is to have anything to do with electroweak symmetry breaking , the masses should be in the region 100  gev  1  tev .",
    "an example of the strong coupling this scenario is `` technicolor '' or models based on dynamical symmetry breaking@xcite . again , if the dynamics is to have anything to do with electroweak symmetry breaking we would expect new states in the region 100  gev  1  tev ; most models predict a large spectrum .",
    "an elegant implementation of this appealing idea is lacking .",
    "however , all models predict structure in the @xmath46 scattering amplitude at around 1 tev center of mass energy",
    ".    there are also other possibilities for new physics that are not necessarily related to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking . there could be new neutral or charged gauge bosons with mass larger than the @xmath23 and @xmath27 ; there could be new quarks , charged leptons or massive neutrinos ; or quarks and leptons could turn out not to be elementary objects . while we have no definitive expectations for the masses of these objects , the lhc must be able to search for them over its available energy range .",
    "high energy physics is explored experimentally by accelerating and colliding beams of quarks and leptons .",
    "electrons ( and/or positrons ) and protons ( and/or antiprotons ) are used in practice .",
    "it is much easier to reach high energies using protons , but each of the constituent quarks and gluons carries only a fraction of the total energy .",
    "the present comprehensive state of understanding the standard model stems in large part from our having a wide range of facilities which explore the interactions between the fermions at energy scales @xmath47 of order @xmath48gev to @xmath49gev .",
    "these are :    * the fermilab tevatron collider , with @xmath50 collisions at @xmath51tev ; * the cern lep collider , with @xmath52 collisions at @xmath53 , increasing to about 180  gev in lep  2 ( 1996 ) ; * the slac slc collider , with @xmath52 collisions at @xmath53 ; * the desy hera collider , which collides 30  gev @xmath54 with 800  gev protons .    while either lep 2 or the tevatron may be sufficiently lucky to discover new physics in the coming decade , there is _ only one _ facility under construction that will really enable us to address interactions at energy scales 250  gev  1  tev : cern s large hadron collider . at present , this is our only sure window on to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the lhc machine is a proton - proton collider that will be installed in the 26.6 km circumference tunnel currently used by the lep electron - positron collider at cern @xcite .",
    "the 8.4 tesla dipole magnets each 14.2 meters long ( magnetic length ) are of the `` 2 in 1 '' type ; the apertures for both beams have common mechanical structure and cryostat .",
    "these superconducting magnets operate at 1.9k and have an aperture of 56 mm .",
    "they will be placed on the floor in the lep ring after removal and storage of lep .",
    "the 1104 dipoles and 736 quadruples support beams of 7  tev energy and a circulating current of 0.54 a.    bunches of protons separated by 25 ns and with an rms length of 75 mm intersect at four points where experiments are placed .",
    "two of these are high luminosity regions and house the atlas and cms detectors .",
    "two other regions house the alice detector @xcite , to be used for the study of heavy ion collisions , and lhc - b@xcite , a detector optimised for the study of b - mesons and b - baryons . the beams cross at an angle of 200@xmath7rad resulting in peak luminosity of @xmath55 @xmath56 sec@xmath57 which has a lifetime of 10 hours . at the peak luminosity",
    "there are an average of @xmath58 interactions per bunch crossing .",
    "ultimately , the peak luminosity may increase to @xmath59 @xmath56 sec@xmath57 .",
    "the machine will also be able to accelerate heavy ions resulting in the possibility of pb - pb collisions at 1150 tev in the center of mass and luminosity up to @xmath60 @xmath56 sec@xmath57 .    in the @xmath61 version , which will be the focus of the rest of this article",
    ", the lhc can be thought of as a parton - parton collider with beams of partons of indefinite energy .",
    "the effective luminosity@xcite of these collisions is proportional to the @xmath61 luminosity and falls rapidly with the center of mass energy of the parton - parton system .",
    "the combination of the higher energy and luminosity of the lhc compared to the highest energy collider currently operating , the tevatron , implies that the accessible energy range is extended by approximately a factor of ten .",
    "the fundamental goal is to uncover and explore the physics behind electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this involves the following specific challenges :    * discover or exclude the standard model higgs and/or the multiple higgses of supersymmetry . *",
    "discover or exclude supersymmetry over the entire theoretically allowed mass range . * discover or exclude new dynamics at the electroweak scale    the energy range opened up by the lhc gives us the opportunity to search for other , possibly less well motivated , objects :    * discover or exclude any new electroweak gauge bosons with masses below several tev . * discover or exclude any new quarks or leptons that are kinematically accessible .",
    "finally we have the possibility of exploiting the enormous production rates for certain standard model particles to conduct the following studies :    * the decay properties of the top quark , limits on exotic decays such as @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "* @xmath19-physics , particularly that of b - baryons and @xmath64 mesons .",
    "an lhc experiment must have the ability to find the unexpected .",
    "new phenomena of whatever type will decay into the particles of the standard model . in order to cover",
    "the lists given above a detector must have great flexibility .",
    "the varied physics signatures for these processes require the ability to reconstruct and measure final states involving the following    * charged leptons including the tau .",
    "* the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "* jets coming from the production at high transverse momentum of quarks and gluons . *",
    "jets that have b - quarks within them . *",
    "( missing transverse ) energy carried off by weakly interacting neutral particles such as neutrinos .",
    "particle i d which is required for a detailed study of b - physics , as opposed to b - tagging , is not part of atlas or cms .    in the discussion of physics signals that we present below , it is necessary to estimate production cross sections for both signal and background processes .",
    "these are estimated using perturbative qcd and depend on several ingredients .",
    "differences can arise from the structure functions that are used ; the energy ( @xmath67 scale ) used in the evaluation of the qcd coupling constant and the structure functions ; and the order in qcd perturbation theory that is used in the calculation of the underlying parton process .",
    "these issues can make comparison between different simulations of the same process difficult .",
    "higher order corrections are not known for all processes and in some cases they are known for the signal and not for the background .",
    "when the corrections are known , they are often not incorporated in the event generator tools that are employed . except where noted ,",
    "we have adopted a conservative approach and use calculations that are only to lowest order .",
    "almost all higher order corrections increase the rates , and are sometimes included by multiplying the lowest order rates by a so - called k - factor .",
    "these corrections are typically @xmath68 and can occasionally be as large as 2.0 .",
    "since the corrections depend on kinematical details this procedure is at best an approximation .",
    "uncertainties from the choice of scale and structure functions are at the 20% level except in cases involving the production of very light states .",
    "the total cross - section for b - quark production is particularly uncertain .",
    "the level of simulation used in the processes varies quite widely .",
    "for a few processes a full geant@xcite style simulation has been carried out .",
    "such simulations are very slow ( @xmath69 mips / event ) and are difficult to carry out for processes where large number of events need to be simulated and many strategies for extracting signals need to be pursued . in these cases",
    "a particle level simulation and parameterized detector response is used . a lower level of simulation involving partons ( _ i.e. _ leptons and jets ) and parameterized response is fast and might be required when the underlying parton process is not present in full event generators .",
    "this last level of simulation is useful for exploring signals but often leads to overly optimistic results , particularly where the reconstruction of invariant masses of jets are involved .",
    "none of the results included here use this last level of simulation , unless stated explicitly .",
    "two large , general - purpose @xmath61 collider detectors will be constructed for lhc : atlas@xcite and cms@xcite .",
    "both collaborations completed technical proposals for their detectors in december 1994 , and were formally approved in january 1996 .",
    "though they differ in most details , the detectors share many common emphases which derive from the physics goals of lhc :    * they both include precision electromagnetic calorimetry ; * they both use a rather ambitious magnet ( though of different geometries ) in order to obtain good muon identification and precision momentum measurement ; * both have lepton identification and measurement over @xmath70 ; * they both incorporate ambitious multi - layer silicon tracker systems for heavy flavor tagging ( the usefulness of this capability is an important lesson from the tevatron ) ; * they both include forward calorimetry for large @xmath71 coverage in order to obtain the required @xmath72 resolution .",

    "these provide a unique opportunity to learn , in a somewhat less demanding environment , how to deal with many of the challenges of high luminosity hadron collider physics , such as energy from pileup events , discrimination between multiple vertices , trigger rates dominated by backgrounds , and heavy flavor tagging , in a real experiment .",
    "we will use `` higgs bosons '' to refer to any scalar particles whose existence is connected to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "generically , higgs bosons couple most strongly to heavy particles .",
    "their production cross section in hadron colliders is small resulting in final states with low signal to background ratios .",
    "the ability to detect them and measure their mass provides a set of benchmarks by which detectors can be judged .",
    "a specific model is required in order to address the quantitative questions of how well the detector can perform . while one may not believe in the details of any particular model",
    ", a survey of them will enable general statements to be made about the potential of the lhc and its detectors .",
    "all the properties of the standard model higgs boson are determined once its mass is fixed .",
    "the search strategy at lhc is therefore well defined .",
    "the current limit on the mass of the higgs boson is @xmath96 gev for experiments at lep@xcite .",

    "the branching ratio is very small and there is a large background from the pair production of photons via @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and the bremsstrahlung process @xmath107 .",
    "excellent photon energy resolution is required to observe this signal , and this process is one that drives the very high quality electromagnetic calorimetry of both experiments .",
    "cms has a mass resolution of order 540 ( 870 ) mev at @xmath108 for low ( high ) luminosity@xcite .",
    "the mass resolution is worse at high luminosity due to event pile up and the presence of a preshower detector that is used to determine the photon direction .",
    "this preshower is necessary as there are multiple interactions and the primary vertex is not readily recognised .",
    "the preshower enables the photon direction to be determined with a precision of @xmath109 and used to resolve the ambiguity in which of the several events contains the signal and therefore what point along the beam is used in computing the diphoton invariant mass .",

    "the atlas mass resolution at high ( low ) luminosity is 1.2 ( 1.1 ) gev for at @xmath110 gev .",
    "however the photon acceptance and identification efficiency are higher in the atlas analysis@xcite , partly because cms rejects photons that convert in the inner detector .",
    "in addition to the background from @xmath104 final states , there are @xmath111 and @xmath112 final states , that are much larger . a @xmath113 rejection factor of @xmath114 is needed to bring these backgrounds below the irreducible @xmath104 background .",
    "a detailed geant based study of the atlas detector has been performed to study these backgrounds@xcite .",
    "jets were rejected by applying cuts on the hadronic leakage , photon isolation and the measured width of the electromagnetic shower .",
    "these cuts result in an estimate of these backgrounds which is a factor of six below the irreducible @xmath104 background .",
    "the background @xmath115 where both electrons are misidentified as photons was found to be significantly below the jet background , except in the range @xmath116 . in this case",
    ", stringent track rejection is needed .",
    "given the uncertainties in the rates for these `` reducible '' backgrounds one can be confident that they are smaller than the irreducible @xmath104 background , but they may not be negligible .",
    "the cms analysis for this process is as follows@xcite .",
    "two isolated photons are required one of which has @xmath117 gev and the other has @xmath118 gev .",
    "both are required to satisfy @xmath119 .",
    "isolation means that there is no track or additional electromagnetic energy cluster with @xmath120 in a cone of size @xmath121 around the photon direction .",
    "the higgs signal then appears as a peak over the smooth background .",
    "the signal to background ratio is small , but there are many events .",
    "a curve can be fitted to the smooth background and subtracted from data .",
    "4 shows the result of this subtraction .",
    "peaks are shown corresponding to higgs masses of 90 , 110 and 130 gev .",
    "the figure also shows the event rate needed to establish a signal of some significance as a function of the mass . from this one",
    "can see that this mode can discover the higgs if its mass is too high to be detected at lep and below about 140 gev . at larger masses",
    "the branching ratio becomes too small for a signal to be extracted .",
    "the large event rate for this process implies that it becomes effective for a more limited range of higgs masses once the integrated luminosity exceeds @xmath122  fb@xmath57 .",
    "results of the atlas study are similar and the reach of the two experiments is similar@xcite    = 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    another process is available at the lower end of the mass range . if the higgs is produced in association with at @xmath27 or @xmath123 , the cross section is substantially reduced , but the presence of additional particles proportionally larger reduction in the background .",
    "events are required to have an isolated lepton arising from the decay of the @xmath27 ( or top quark ) .",
    "this lepton can be used to determine the vertex position .",
    "the process is only useful at high luminosity , for @xmath124 pb@xmath57 there are approximately 15 signal events for higgs masses between 90 and 120 gev ( the falling cross - section is compensated by the increased branching ratio for @xmath125 ) over an approximately equal background @xcite",
    ". the process will therefore provide confirmation of a discovery made in the @xmath104 final state without an associated lepton .",

    "there are more potentially important sources of background in this channel than in the @xmath209 final state .",
    "in addition to the irreducible background from @xmath199 final states , one has to worry about @xmath210 events where the missing @xmath208 arises from neutrinos in the jets or from cracks and other detector effects that cause jet energies to be mismeasured . at high luminosity",
    "the background from the pile up of minimum bias events produces a @xmath211 spectrum that falls very rapidly and is completely negligible for @xmath212 gev , provided the calorimeter extends to @xmath213 .",

    "the events were selected so that a large fraction of them had jets going into the region @xmath215 where atlas has weaker jet energy resolution due to the crack between the endcap and barrel hadron calorimeters .",

    "this estimate correctly models the contribution from b - decays which the full study showed to be dominant .",
    "a cut was imposed requiring that reconstructed @xmath216 has @xmath217 gev .",
    "this cut causes the @xmath199 background to peak .",

    "the statistical significance of the signal shown is large but it is difficult to assess at this stage the true significance when data are actually taken .",
    "the dominant @xmath199 background has qcd corrections of order 40% @xcite .",
    "once data are available this background will be measured .",
    "the cms analysis of this process@xcite uses a central jet veto requiring that there be no jets with @xmath219 gev within @xmath220 . by requiring a jet in the far forward region ( see below ) , most of the remaining @xmath199 background can be rejected .",
    "a study by cms requiring a jet with @xmath221 and @xmath222 , produces an improvement of approximately a factor of three in the signal to background ratio at the cost of some signal .",
    "this mode is only effective for high mass higgs bosons and becomes powerful only at high luminosity .",
    "nevertheless it will provide an unambiguous signal .",
    "= 8.5 cm    substantially larger event samples are available if the decay modes @xmath223 and @xmath224 can be exploited efficiently . in order to do",

    "henceforth the discussion will be for the @xmath46 final state ; the @xmath199 state is similar .",
    "the first step is to reconstruct the @xmath27 decay to jets@xcite .",
    "a particle level simulation was used including the effects of pile up at high luminosity .",
    "basic calorimeter cells of @xmath226 and energy threshold of @xmath227 gev per cell were used .",
    "jets were found using a cone of size @xmath228 and required to have @xmath229 gev . within these cones",
    "two smaller jets with @xmath230 and @xmath231 gev were reconstructed .",
    "this algorithm reconstructs @xmath232 with an efficiency of about 60% and a w mass resolution of approximately 6.5 gev for @xmath233 produced in the decay of 1 tev higgs bosons .",
    "the mass resolution is slightly better at low luminosity where pile up is unimportant .",
    "these cuts applied to the @xmath234 sample with @xmath235 gev reduces the rate for this process by a factor of 500 and brings it to a level approximately equal to that from @xmath123 production ; @xmath236 .",
    "a limited statics full simulation of this method in the atlas detector is in qualitative agreement with the above study @xcite .    after these cuts , the backgrounds from @xmath225 and @xmath123 are still larger than the signal from @xmath237 and topological cuts are required .",
    "one of the processes @xmath238 produces the higgs boson in association with jets at large rapidity .",
    "these jets can be used as a tag to reject background .",
    "this forward jet tag will cause some loss of signal since the @xmath97 process lacks these forward jets .",
    "hence it is only effective for high mass higgs bosons where the @xmath238 process is a significant part of the cross section .",
    "the central part ( in rapidity ) of the higgs events is expected to have less jet activity in it than the background , particularly that background from @xmath123 . at low luminosity , requiring that the events have no additional jets ( apart from the ones that make up the w candidate ) with @xmath239 gev and @xmath240 loses approximately 30% of the signal and reduces the background from @xmath225 ( @xmath123 ) by a factor of 3 ( 30 ) . at high luminosity the requirement has to be raised to @xmath241 gev in order to preserve the efficiency for the signal .",
    "the rejection factors for @xmath225 and @xmath123 are then 2.5 and 12 .",
    "the forward jet tagging was investigated in atlas as follows .",
    "clusters energy of size @xmath228 were found in the region @xmath242 .",
    "events from the pile up of minimum bias events have jets in this regions so the threshold on @xmath208 of the jet must be set high enough so that these jets do not generate tags in the background .",
    "if the individual calorimeter cells are required to have @xmath243 gev , then there is there is a 4.6% ( 0.07% ) probability that the pile up at high luminosity will contribute a single ( double ) tag to an event that would otherwise not have one for tagging jets with @xmath239 gev and @xmath244 gev .",
    "the requirements for single and double tags are then applied to the signal from a higgs boson of mass 1 tev and the various backgrounds .",
    "the pile up contributions are included and the event rates for a luminosity of @xmath124 pb@xmath57 shown in table [ taggingtable ] .",
    ".@xmath245 signals and backgrounds , for @xmath246  tev , before and after cuts in the forward region ( see text ) . the rates are computed for an integrated luminosity of @xmath247 and a lepton efficiency of 90% . only the @xmath248 contribution to the signal",

    "this is sufficient to just reach the interesting region where one may hope to see deviations from the standard model given present limits on the scale of new physics .",
    "the potential for the study of the top quark at hadron colliders is already apparent .",
    "its recent discovery at the tevatron undoubtedly presages a long and fruitful program of top physics studies .",
    "the lhc will be a top factory , with about 10@xmath252 @xmath151 pairs produced per year at a luminosity of @xmath253 .",
    "this would result in about 200,000 reconstructed @xmath254 events and 20,000 clean @xmath255 events .",
    "the top mass may be reconstructed from the @xmath254 final state using the invariant mass of the 3-jet system .",
    "problems arise from the presence of backgrounds , from combinatorics , and from systematic effects due to the detector and the theoretical models used .",
    "atlas@xcite have estimated that an accuracy of @xmath256  gev could be attained . by selecting very high-@xmath128 top quarks , where the decay products are boosted and thus close , combinatorics may be reduced , and the mass measured to perhaps @xmath257  gev .",
    "this measurement requires , of course , that the hadronic calorimetry be calibrated to this level in the absolute energy scale and that its response be stable over time .",
    "cms have investigated the possibility of in - situ calibration of the jet response within top events by reconstruction of the hadronic @xmath27 decays , a possibility already evident in the present cdf and d  data .",
    "the mass may also be reconstructed from dilepton events .",
    "atlas estimate that , by selecting events with two leptons from @xmath27 decays and an additional lepton from @xmath19-decay , and plotting the invariant mass of the lepton pair originating from the same top decay , the mass could be determined with a statistical accuracy of @xmath258  gev , and a total accuracy of about @xmath257  gev .",
    "the dominant systematic errors arise from uncertainties in the @xmath19-quark fragmentation and are therefore complementary to the 3-jet system which is dominated by calorimeter and jet systematics .      in extensions of the standard model with charged higgs bosons @xmath45 , such as in the mssm ,",
    "the decay @xmath259 may compete with the standard @xmath260 if kinematically allowed .",
    "the @xmath45 decays to @xmath261 or @xmath262 depending on the value of @xmath263 . over most of the range @xmath264 , the decay mode @xmath265 dominates",
    "the signal for @xmath45 production is thus an excess of taus produced in @xmath151 events .",
    "both atlas@xcite and cms@xcite have investigated the sensitivity to this excess .",
    "top events with at least one isolated high-@xmath128 lepton are selected , and the number having an additional tau compared with the number having an additional @xmath6 or @xmath7 . both studies used @xmath19-tagging to reduce the backgrounds to top production .",
    "taus were identified in a way very similar to that described earlier ( in the section on @xmath266 searches ) . the uncertainty in the tau excess is estimated to be @xmath256% , dominated by systematics .",
    "for an integrated luminosity of @xmath198 , both atlas and cms conclude that over most of the @xmath263 range , a signal can be observed at the @xmath267 level for @xmath268  gev , which corresponds to the region @xmath269  gev in the @xmath270 plane .      the large statistics available at lhc will provide sensitivity to other non - standard or rare top decays . as an example",
    ", atlas have investigated the channel @xmath271@xcite , which should occur at a negligible level in the sm . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath195 , branching ratios as small as @xmath272 could be measured .",
    "the tev2000 study@xcite estimates that lhc will attain a precision 23 times better than tev33 on the ratio of longitudinal to left - handed @xmath27 s produced in @xmath15 decays .",
    "this ratio is exactly predicted in the sm for a given top mass , and is sensitive to non - standard couplings at the @xmath273 vertex , such as a possible @xmath274 contribution .",
    "the preceding sections have shown the importance of @xmath19-tagging in addressing many of the high-@xmath128 physics goals of the lhc .",
    "both major detectors will consequently have the capability to tag heavy flavor production through displaced vertices .",
    "this capability , together with the @xmath19-quark production cross - section at the lhc , will enable them to also pursue a targeted but interesting program of @xmath19-physics .",
    "it can be assumed that cp violation in the @xmath275quark system will have been observed before the lhc gives data .",
    "nevertheless the enormous rate will enable a very precise determination of @xmath276 to be made using the decay @xmath277 .",
    "an error of @xmath278 can be expected after @xmath279 fb@xmath57 of integrated luminosity .",
    "it should also be possible to measure @xmath280 mixing and to search for rare decays such as @xmath281 .",
    "the lhc is unique among accelerators currently existing or under construction .",
    "it will have sufficient energy and luminosity to enable vital discoveries to be made and will lead to insight into the mass generation mechanism of the standard model .",
    "the very detailed simulation studies carried out by the atlas and cms collaborations enable one to make the following statements with a high degree of confidence:-    * if the minimal standard model is correct and the higgs boson is not discovered at lep ii , it will be found at lhc . *",
    "if supersymmetry is relevant to the breaking of electroweak symmetry , it will be discovered at lhc and many details of the particular supersymmetric model will be disentangled . *",
    "if the higgs sector is that of the minimal supersymmetric model , at least one higgs decay channel will be seen , no matter what the parameters turn out to be . in many cases , several higgs bosons or decay channels will be seen . * if the electroweak symmetry breaking proceeds via some new strong interactions , many resonances and new exotic particles will almost certainly be observed . * new gauge bosons with masses less than several tev will be discovered or ruled out .",
