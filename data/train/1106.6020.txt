    "to better understand the heavy flavor production and energy loss mechanism , it is crucial to determine experimentally the relative contributions of charm and bottom hadron decays to npe and to study detailed characteristics of heavy quark interactions with the bulk qcd medium .    the separation of bottom and charm contributions to npe has been achieved for @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1  gev by studying the near side of npe - hadron azimuthal correlation  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we extend this analysis to @xmath0 collisions at @xmath4  gev .",
    "since the high @xmath5 ( @xmath6  gev / c ) npes represent well the directions of their heavy flavor parents , and since heavy flavor quarks are produced close to back - to - back , the away side of the npe - hadron azimuthal correlation in @xmath2 collisions bears the information of the processes of heavy flavor quarks traversing bulk qcd medium . as a result , one can use the npe - hadron azimuthal correlations to study the heavy flavor tagged jet - medium interactions , as we do in this work , which can shed light on the medium responses beyond flow - like correlations .",
