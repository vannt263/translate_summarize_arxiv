    "it is widely believed that many astrophysical objects are powered by mass accretion on to black holes .",
    "black hole accretion disk models have been extensively studied during the past three decades ( see kato et al .",
    "2008 for a review ) .",
    "the standard geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc model can be successfully explained by most of the observational features in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "besides the traditional standard disk model by shakura and sunayev ( 1973 ) , there are a number of new disk classifications including advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) or radiative inefficient accretion flows ( riaf ) for a very small mass - accretion disks ( narayan & yi 1994 ) and supercritical accretion disk or so - called slim disk , for a very large mass - accretion rate ( abramowicz et al 1998 ) .",
    "adafs are optically thin and hot ( compared to the virial temperature of the gas in the flows ) , which radiate mostly in x - ray waveband ( see narayan & mcclintock 2008 ) . in the adaf model , only a small fraction of the gravitational energy released in the accretion flow is radiated away due to inefficient cooling and most of it energy is stored in the accretion flow and advected to the black hole .",
    "this model can successfully explain the main observational features of black hole x - ray binaries and low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a ; quataert et al .",
    "1999 ; yuan et al . 2003 ; ho 2008 ) .",
    "the diversity of models indicates that modeling the hot accretion flows around a black hole is a challenging and controversial problem .",
    "one of the largely neglected physical phenomena in the modeling adafs is the thermal conduction .",
    "recent observations of hot accretion flows around active galactic nuclei indicate that it should be based on collision - less regime ( tanaka & menou 2006 ) .",
    "it is also suggested that accretion in these systems proceeds under the weakly collisional condition .",
    "furthermore , it is proposed that thermal conduction can be a possible mechanism through which sufficient extra heating is provided in hot advection dominated accretion flows .",
    "so , thermal conduction seems to have an important role in energy transport in the accreting materials around a hot accretion disk where they are nearly completely ionized .",
    "since advection - dominated disks have high temperatures , the internal energy per particle is high .",
    "this is one of the reasons why advective cooling overcomes radiative cooling .",
    "for the same reason , turbulent heat transport by conduction in the radial direction is non - negligible in the heat balance equation .",
    "so it should be important to consider the role of thermal conduction in an adaf solution .",
    "shadmehri ( 2008 ) , faghei ( 2011 ) , abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) tanaka & menou ( 2006 ) have studied the effect of hot accretion flow with thermal conduction in a semi - analytical method ; physics of such systems have been studied in simulation models ( e. g. sharma et al .",
    "2008 ; wu et al .",
    "shadmehri ( 2008 ) has shown that thermal conduction opposes the rotational velocity , but increases the temperature .",
    "abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that for this problem there are two types of solutions ; high and low accretion rates .",
    "they plotted the radial velocity for both solutions which revealed that it is influenced by thermal conduction . in this study , by introducing a new physical condition , it has been shown that high accretion rate solutions of abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are not exactly correct . also some of the low accretion rate solutions presented there are not of physical value . with this extra condition",
    "it is possible to find the physically meaningful parametric space using which we next plotted the dynamical quantities to investigate how thermal conduction affects them . finally , tangled magnetic fields in accretion flows are likely to reduce the effective mean free path of particles .",
    "the magnitude of this reduction , which depends on field geometry , is still unknown . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the effect of thermal conduction on the physical structure of adaf - like accretion flow around a black hole in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "we are interested in analyzing the structure of a magnetized adaf where thermal conduction plays an important role in energy transportation .",
    "we only consider toroidal component of the magnetic field and suppose that the gaseous disk is rotating around a compact object of mass @xmath1 .",
    "thus , for a steady axi - symmetric accretion flow , i.e. @xmath2 , we can write the standard equations in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we vertically integrate the flow equations and so , all the physical variables only become functions of radial distance @xmath4 . moreover , relativistic effects are neglected and newtonian gravity in radial direction is taken into account .",
    "the disk is supposed to be turbulent and possesses an effective turbulent viscosity @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt @xmath6-prescription for viscosity of a rotating gaseous disk . as for conservation of energy",
    ", it is assumed the energy generated due to viscosity dissipation is balanced by the radiation , thermal conduction and advection cooling ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 , abbassi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "the equation of continuity reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the accretion velocity ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 is the surface density at a cylindrical radius @xmath4 . where @xmath11 the mass loss rate per unit volume , h is the disk s half - thickness .",
    "the equation of motion in the radial direction is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the rotational velocity of the disk , sound velocity and alfven velocities of the gas , respectively .",
    "sound speed and the alfven velocity are defined as @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the gas and the magnetic pressures , respectively .",
    "the vertically integrated angular momentum equation becomes : @xmath19 where @xmath6 is the viscose parameter,@xmath20 the angular velocity and @xmath21 the keplerian angular velocity , respectively .    by integrating over @xmath22 of the hydrostatic balance one",
    "gets : @xmath23=(1+\\beta)c_s^{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 which indicates the important of magnetic field pressure compared to gas pressure ( akizuki & fukue 2006 , abbassi et al . 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "two cases can be considered ; case 1 : where the pressure is assumed to be the gas pressure ( thermal pressure ) ( which is the choice of this paper ) and case 2 : when the pressure is assumed to be the total of magnetic plus gas pressure .",
    "so in case 2 we replace @xmath6 with @xmath25 in all of the equations .",
    "next , the dynamical properties of the disk for different values of @xmath26 is demonstrated .",
    "the energy equation considering cooling and heating processes in an adaf can be found as follows .",
    "we assume the energy generated due to viscous dissipation and the heat conducted into the volume are balanced by the advection cooling and energy transport by thermal conduction .",
    "thus , @xmath27 on the right - hand side of the energy equation we have : @xmath28    where @xmath29 represents energy transfer due to the thermal conduction and @xmath30 is the saturated conduction flux ( cowie & mackee1977 ) in the direction of temperature gradient .",
    "@xmath31 , the dimensionless coefficient , is less than unity .",
    "finally since we consider the toroidal component for the global magnetic field , the induction equation can be written as : @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the field scaping / creating rate due to magnetic instability or dynamo effect .",
    "now we have a set of mhd equations that describe the structure of magnetized adafs .",
    "the solutions to these equations are strongly correlated to viscosity , magnetic field strength @xmath26 , the degree of advection @xmath34 and the thermal conduction parameter @xmath35 for the disks .",
    "we seek a self - similar solution for the above equations . in the next section",
    "we will present self - similar solutions to these equations .",
    "in order to have a better understanding of the physical processes taking place in our disks , we seek self - similar solutions of the above equations . the self - similar method has a wide range of applications for the full set of mhd equations although it is unable to describe the global behavior of accretion flows since no boundary conditions have been taken into account .",
    "however , as long as we are not interested in the behavior of the flow near the boundaries , these solutions are still valid . in the self - similar model the velocities are assumed to be expressed as follows : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and constant @xmath41,@xmath42 and @xmath43 are determined later from the main mhd equations .",
    "we obtain the disk half - thickness h as : @xmath44 hence , a hot accretion also has a conical surface , whose opening ( half - thickness ) angle is @xmath45 . assuming the surface density @xmath46 to be in the form of : @xmath47 we obtained , e.g . @xmath48 @xmath49    by substituting the above self - similar solutions in to the the equations of the disks , we obtain the following system of dimensionless equations , to be solved for @xmath41,@xmath42 and @xmath43 : in case 1 : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52c_3\\ ] ] @xmath53 @xmath54    it is evident from the above equations that for @xmath55 there is no mass loss while it is present for the case where @xmath56 . on the other hands ,",
    "the escape and creation of magnetic fields balance one another for @xmath57 .",
    "although outflow is one of the most important processes in accretion theory,(see narayan & yi 1995 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; stone & pringle & begelman1999 and also some recent work like xie & yua 2008 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2011 ) , but in our model we choose a self - similar solution in which @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath55 ) thus ignoring the effect of wind and outflow on the structure of the disk .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations , we obtain a forth order algebraic equation for @xmath41 : @xmath60    where the coefficients depend on the input parameter as : @xmath61 @xmath62[\\frac{1}{3(s+1)}]}\\ ] ] @xmath63^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    this algebraic equation shows that the variable @xmath41 which determines the behavior of radial velocity only depends on the @xmath6 , @xmath31 , @xmath26 and @xmath34 . using @xmath41 from this equation",

    "( 2008 ) have found two types of solutions which represent high and low accretion rates .",
    "these two rates act differently towards the saturated thermal conduction parameter , @xmath35 .",
    "as it was stated in the introduction the main aim of this paper is to place an additional physical condition .",
    "this new requirement limits the solutions of @xmath70 . from the above equation , @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ", we have :    @xmath72    therefore the @xmath73 parametric space could be found as follows :    @xmath74    a numerical solution to this equation is presented in fig . 1 for variety of values of the viscosity parameter @xmath6 and the thermal conduction parameter @xmath35 . these solutions may be considered either as flows with a fixed value of viscosity parameter and a sequence of increasing thermal conduction parameter or a sequence of different values of viscosity parameter @xmath6 in a fixed thermal conduction regime .",
    "these plots show that the new physical condition places a constraint on the physically valid parametric space . as a result we used this extra condition to check the validity of the solutions presented by abbassi et al .",
    "tanaka & meneu ( 2006 ) , abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that for a very small @xmath35 their solutions coincide the original 1d adaf solutions ; but by adding the saturated conduction parameter , @xmath35 , the effect of thermal conduction can be better seen while approaching @xmath75 . on the other hand , the widely accepted values of @xmath6 are between @xmath76 .",
    "so we have to plot our solutions in this range .",
    "the dark areas in fig1 are where we are looking for ; regions of the parametric space physically acceptable .",

    "the radial velocity is generally less than free fall velocity on a point mass , but it becomes larger if the advection parameter @xmath34 is increased and such behavior is consistent with the previous analytical solutions ( e.g. , akizuki & fukue 2006 ; abbassi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) . for a given @xmath34 ,",
    "both the radial and rotational velocities increase as the disk becomes more magnetized ( i.e. , larger @xmath26 ) .",
    "a magnetized disk must rotate faster than the case where no magnetic field is present because of the effect of magnetic tension .",
    "it is clear that increasing the magnetic field strength increases radial velocity ( accretion rate ) in the accretion flows .",

    "the widely accepted values of @xmath6 are between @xmath76 .",
    "so we have to plot our solutions in this range .",
    "we can see that for a given set of input parameters , the solution reaches a non - rotating limit at a specific value of @xmath35 .",
    "we can not extend the solution for values of this limit for @xmath35 because equation ( 25 ) gives a negative value for @xmath79 , which is clearly not valid .",

    "as it is seen in the lower panels of figures 4 and 5 by increasing @xmath80 the vertical thickness of the disks in a given @xmath35 will increase .",
    "but the vertical thickness in a fixed @xmath26 or @xmath34 , will decrease globally as @xmath35 increased .",

    "[ figure7 ]    as the level of thermal conduction is increased , more heat flows outward from the hot inner regions , resulting in a local increase of the gas temperature relative to the original adaf solutions .",

    "we have found that the level of advection , @xmath34 , will significantly modify the structure of the disk .",
    "the breakdown of the solutions , when @xmath81 , occurs at lower values of @xmath35 .",
    "clearly thermal conduction can significantly affect the structure and the properties of the hot accretion flows . in order to understand the role of thermal conduction better",
    "it is useful to study it in a more realistic two - dimensional case , without height integrations .",
    "but at this stage we are going to find out how thermal conduction affects the structure of the disks with a simple analysis .",
    "it would be interesting to show how the surface density , radial velocity and accretion rate which are all observables , change with the radius of the disk when the thermal conduction plays an important role . to show how surface density is affected by our input parameters we use : @xmath82 where accretion rate is constant from the continuity equation ; eq(1 ) . assuming @xmath83 and @xmath84 and by using self - similar solution for @xmath85 we have : @xmath86 as it is seen in figures 6 and 7 , we have plotted the surface density , @xmath46 , and radial velocity as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "as expected , the absolute values of surface density and radial velocity will decrease as one moves out farther in the disk . in figure 6",
    "it is evident that surface density is increased when thermal conduction plays an important role .",
    "but by adding the advection parameter @xmath46 will decrease significantly . by adding viscous and advection parameters the absolute values of radial velocity",
    "will increased in a fixed @xmath4 , as expected .",
    "thermal conduction has the same effect and causes high radial velocity when it has an important role .",
    "compared to other physical parameters , the magnetic field , @xmath26 , does not have a significant effect on surface density and velocity gradients .",
    "in this paper , we studied an accretion disk in the advection dominated regime by considering a purely toroidal magnetic field and in presence of thermal conduction .",
    "some approximations were made in order to simplify the main equations .",
    "we assumed an axially symmetric , static disk with the @xmath6-prescription of viscosity .",
    "we also ignored relativistic effects and self - gravity of the disk . considering the weakly collisional nature of a hot accretion flow ( tanaka & menou 2006 ; abbassi et al .",
    "2008 ) , a saturated form of thermal conduction was adopted as a possible mechanism for energy transportation .",
    "we have accounted for this possibility by allowing the saturated thermal conduction constant , @xmath35 , to vary in our solutions .",
    "a set of similarity solutions was presented for such a configuration . also following those presented by abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we re - examined the validity of their solutions by putting an additional physical condition .",
    "they had found two types of solutions : low and high accretion rate solutions .",
    "their solutions had different behaviors towards thermal conduction parameters .",
    "we found out that the high accretion rate solution presented by abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is not physically valid .",
    "also our new imposed condition puts some physical constrain on low accretion rate solutions . as a result in order to have a physically valid solution only a small part of parameter space should be considered .",
    "after we assuring the validity of our solutions , by using proper values of input parameter , @xmath87 , we investigated the influence of thermal conduction on the structure of accretion flows .",
    "it is shown that the surface density is increased when the thermal conduction plays an important role .",
    "also thermal conduction has the same effect on radial velocity . however , there exist some limitations to our solutions .",
    "one is that the self - similar hot accretion flow with conduction is a single - temperature structure .",
    "thus if one uses a two - temperatures structure for the ions and electrons in the disks , it is expected that the ions and electron temperatures decouple in the inner regions , which will modify the role of conduction .",
    "the other limitation of our solution is the anisotropic character of conduction in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "balbus ( 2001 ) has argued that the structure of the hot flows could be affected by the anisotropic character of thermal conduction in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "although our preliminary self - similar solutions are too simplified , they clearly improve our understanding of the physics of adafs around a black hole . to have a realistic picture of an accretion flow a global solution",
    "is needed rather than the self - similar one . in our future studies",
    "we intend to investigate the effect of thermal conduction on the observational appearance and properties of a hot magnetized flow .",
