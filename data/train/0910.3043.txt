    "magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process of energy release that lies at the core of many dynamic phenomena in the solar system such as solar flares , coronal heating events , geomagnetic substorms and flux transfer events .",
    "reconnection in three dimensions has been shown to be completely different in many fundamental respects from the classically studied process in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the main thrust of reconnection theory at present is to understand the different ways in which it may take place in three dimensions ( e.g. , the books * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a key point is that in three dimensions reconnection occurs where a component of the electric field parallel to the magnetic field is present  and this can be in many different field configurations .",
    "for example , reconnection may occur either at null points ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or in the absence of null points at quasi - separatrix layers or hyperbolic flux tubes @xcite or it may occur along separators that join one null point to another @xcite .",
    "null points are common in the solar atmosphere @xcite and are sometimes implicated in solar flares and coronal mass ejections @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional collapse of a null has been described @xcite and stationary resistive flows near them have been modelled @xcite . in particular , for a linear null and uniform magnetic diffusivity , @xcite discovered field - aligned flows when the spine current is small and spiral field - crossing flows which do not cross the spine or fan when the spine current exceeds a critical value .    a three - dimensional null point possesses two different classes of field lines that connect to the null : for a so - called _ positive null point _ , a surface of field lines ( called a _ fan _ by @xcite ) recede from the null , while an isolated field line ( called the _ spine _ of the null ) approaches it from two directions ; for a _ negative null point _ ,",
    "on the other hand the fan approaches the null , while the spine recedes from it .",
    "( for an alternative nomenclature see ref .",
    "the different types of linear null were categorised by @xcite .",
    "the generic null in a potential magnetic field is an improper radial null , with the fan perpendicular to the spine and the field lines in the fan approaching or receding from essentially two directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) .",
    "a particular case is the proper radial null in which the field lines in the fan are radial ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) .",
    "the effect of a current along the fan is to make the fan and spine no longer perpendicular ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b ) , whereas a strong enough current along the spine makes the fan field lines spiral ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a ) .",
    "there have been three steps towards categorising reconnection at a null point due to ( i ) analytical ideal modelling , ( ii ) kinematic resistive modelling and ( iii ) computational experiments . the initial analytical ideal treatment by @xcite aimed to understand the types of ideal motions that are possible in the environment of a null point .",
    "they supposed that the nature of reconnection is determined to a large extent by the nature of the large - scale flows : they suggested that an ideal flow across the fan would drive _ spine  reconnection _ , in which a current forms along the spine , whereas an ideal flow across the spine would drive _ fan  reconnection _ with a strong current in the fan .",
    "they also proposed _",
    "separator  reconnection _ with a strong current along a separator joining two nulls .    since then , as we shall see in this paper , although behaviour reminiscent of the early spine and fan models may be observed in certain limiting situations , recent numerical experiments have suggested different forms of spine and fan reconnection and also a hybrid spine - fan regime as being the generic modes that occur in practice .",
    "however , the existence of separator reconnection has been well confirmed by a series of numerical experiments @xcite and its importance in the solar corona has been stressed @xcite . in addition , quasi - separatrix layer reconnection ( called slip - running reconnection by @xcite ) has been confirmed in numerical experiments @xcite and in bright point and flare simulations @xcite .",
    "our aim here is simply to look more closely at the nature of reconnection at a 3d null point and to propose a new categorisation to replace spine reconnection and fan reconnection . in the next section it",
    "is necessary to summarise the main results from theory and computational experiments on null - point reconnection and to reinterpret them in the light of the new regimes of reconnection that we are proposing . in the following sections we consider in turn the properties of the three new types of reconnection , namely , _ torsional  spine  reconnection _ , _ torsional  fan  reconnection _ and the most common regime _ spine - fan  reconnection_.",
    "the simplest linear null point ( for which the magnetic field increases linearly from the null ) has field components @xmath0 in cartesian coordinates or @xmath1 in cylindrical polars , so that @xmath2 identically , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constant .",
    "the field lines are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants .",
    "the @xmath8-axis is the spine and the @xmath9-plane is the fan .",
    "for this so - called _",
    "proper  radial  null _ the fan field lines are straight ( figure [ fig:1]a ) .",
    "it is a particular member ( with @xmath10 ) of a wider class of current - free improper radial null points ( @xmath11 ) with curved fan field lines , having field components @xmath12.\\ ] ] this is the generic form for a current - free null , since the proper radial null is structurally unstable in the sense that it occurs only for a particular value of @xmath13 , but for simplicity much of the theory so far has used a proper radial null .    more generally ,",
    "each of the three field components of a linear null may be written in terms of three constants , making nine in all .",
    "however , @xcite built on earlier work @xcite and showed , by using @xmath2 , by normalising and by rotating the axes , that the nine constants may be reduced to four constants @xmath14 such that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the current parallel to the spine and @xmath17 is the current perpendicular to the spine",
    ". furthermore , both nulls and separators are susceptible to collapse to form current sheets when the boundary conditions allow it @xcite .",
    "the effects in the ideal region around a 3d null of steady reconnection were studied in the kinematic regime by @xcite extending earlier ideas @xcite .",
    "they solved the equations @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 when @xmath22 is given by equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) and a variety of different boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "in particular , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) implies that @xmath23 and then the component of equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) perpendicular to @xmath22 yields @xmath24 which , for certain imposed boundary conditions , may be integrated along field lines ( characteristics ) to determine the value of @xmath25 ( and therefore @xmath21 ) throughout the volume .",
    "then the component of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) perpendicular to @xmath22 determines the plasma velocity normal to @xmath22 everywhere as @xmath26        if a continuous flow is imposed across the fan ( figure [ fig:2]a ) , singularities in @xmath21 and @xmath20 are produced at the spine .",
    "@xcite speculated that this would produce a strong current at the spine in what they dubbed _",
    "spine  reconnection_. they considered the effect of diffusion in a preliminary manner , but they were unable at the time to resolve the singularities at the spine .",
    "as an example , they considered flows with no @xmath27-component and an electric field of the form @xmath28 giving rise to a velocity @xmath29 for which @xmath30 is continuous at the fan @xmath31 , while @xmath32 is singular at the spine @xmath33 .    if , on the other hand , a continuous flow is imposed across the spine ( figure [ fig:2]b ) , singularities are produced at the fan together with a strong _ flipping  flow _ ( that @xcite had previously discovered ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that this would produce a strong current at the fan in what they dubbed _",
    "fan  reconnection_. a particular example is given in terms of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 by a potential of the form @xmath37 $ ] , which produces a flow field @xmath38 for which @xmath39 is continuous on the planes @xmath40 , while @xmath41 and @xmath39 are singular at the fan ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , this analysis left open the questions as to whether it is possible to resolve the singularity and also whether these pure states are likely to be set up in practice .",
    "the next step in the theory was to consider the effect in 3d of an isolated diffusion region where frozen - in flux breaks down and the induction equation is typically of the form @xmath43 reconnection in 3d is very different in many respects from that in 2d .    in 2d , a differentiable flux - transporting velocity @xmath44 @xcite satisfying @xmath45 always exists apart from at the x - point itself .",
    "this velocity has a hyperbolic singularity at an x - type null point , where the reconnection takes place .",
    "the magnetic flux moves at the velocity @xmath44 and slips through the plasma , which itself moves at @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the mapping of the field lines in 2d is discontinuous at the separatrix field lines that thread the x - point .",
    "this mapping discontinuity is associated with the fact that field lines break and reconnect at one point , namely , the x - point .",
    "while they are in the diffusion region , field lines preserve their connections everywhere , except at the x - point .",
    "two flux tubes that move into the diffusion region break and rejoin perfectly to form two new flux tubes that move out . in 3d ,",
    "surprisingly , none of the above properties carry over and so the nature of reconnection is profoundly different @xcite .",
    "first of all , a single flux tube velocity ( @xmath44 ) does not generally exist @xcite since @xmath46 , but it may be replaced by a pair of flux velocities describing separately what happens to field lines that enter or leave the diffusion region @xcite .",
    "secondly , the mapping of field lines is continuous if there is no 3d null point or separatrix surface .",
    "thirdly , as they move through a 3d diffusion region , magnetic field lines continually change their connections .",
    "fourthly , two tubes do nt generally break and reform perfectly to give two other flux tubes : rather , when the two flux tubes are partly in the diffusion region and so are in the process of reconnecting , they split into four parts , each of which flips in a different manner , a manifestation of the continual change of connections .",
    "( note that in general in 2d and 3d the flux velocity @xmath47 is non - unique .",
    "we choose here to consider the case in which we select @xmath44 by insisting that @xmath48 in the ideal region .",
    "the crucial distinction is that in 2d a single @xmath44 exists ( and is singular ) , while in 3d reconnection _ no single _",
    "velocity @xmath44 exists that satisfies ( [ eq:9 ] ) together with the constraint that @xmath48 in the ideal region .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for further discussion . )",
    "the first attempt to model kinematically the effect of an isolated diffusion region was by @xcite who set up a formalism and applied it to a case without null points .",
    "they solved @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath2 .",
    "the idea was to impose a sufficiently simple magnetic field that both the mapping and the inverse mapping of the field can be found analytically .",
    "then , after writing @xmath23 , the integral of the component of ( [ eq:6 ] ) parallel to @xmath22 determines @xmath25 everywhere as an integral @xmath52 along field lines , in terms of the values ( @xmath53 ) at one end of the field lines and the distance @xmath54 along field lines .",
    "more simply in terms of a dimensionless stretched distance @xmath55 such that @xmath56 , @xmath57    one way of isolating the reconnection region in these kinematic solutions is by choosing a form of @xmath58 that is localised .",
    "so - called _ pure _ solutions have @xmath59 and produce counter - rotating ( or flipping ) flows of field lines that link the diffusion region .",
    "the rate of flux reconnection is calculated by evaluating the integral @xmath60 along a field line through the diffusion region @xcite .",
    "then the flow normal to the field lines is determined by the component of equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) perpendicular to @xmath22 as @xmath61 these solutions may be regarded as either kinematic ( i.e. , satisfying just the induction equation ) or as fully dynamic in the limit of uniform density and slow flow ( since they also satisfy the equations @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "@xcite applied this formalism to determine the behaviour of the magnetic flux when an isolated diffusion region contains a spiral null point , i.e.  a null with current directed parallel to the spine line .",
    "the imposed magnetic field was @xmath64 or @xmath65 in cylindrical polars , with the spine and current both directed along the @xmath8-axis , where @xmath66 is a dimensionless current density .",
    "the diffusion region was assumed to be a cylinder of radius @xmath13 and height @xmath67 ( figure [ fig:3]a ) .",
    "first of all , a pure elementary solution which describes the core of the reconnection process was obtained by setting the flow to zero outside the volume defined by the ` envelope ' ( @xmath68 ) of flux that threads the diffusion region . inside @xmath68",
    "the flow and flux velocities are purely rotational ( i.e. , in the @xmath27-direction ) , so that there is no flow across either the spine or the fan .",
    "the reconnection rate is @xmath69 along the spine , and measures the rate of rotational mis - matching of the flux velocities of field lines entering and leaving the diffusion region .",
    "to this solution any ideal solution ( @xmath70 ) may be added and in particular they considered a stagnation - point flow of the form @xmath71 , which brings flux into @xmath68 and carries it out again .",
    "the result is a transition from o - type to x - type flow near the null when @xmath72 exceeds a critical value .",
    "what this solution suggests , therefore , is that a type of spine reconnection with strong current along the spine direction is possible when there are twisting flows about the spine .",
    "this is quite different from the spine reconnection that was envisaged in @xcite and so here we propose to call it _",
    "torsional  spine  reconnection _ and discuss its properties further in section [ sec:3 ] .    next , @xcite applied the same approach to a diffusion region ( @xmath73 ) containing a null point having a uniform fan - aligned current ( @xmath74 ) in the @xmath75-direction and field components @xmath76 the diffusion region was assumed to have the shape of a disc of radius @xmath13 and height @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) ) , inside which the magnetic diffusivity decreases smoothly and monotonically from the null to zero at its boundary .",
    "outside @xmath73 it vanishes .",
    "the resulting plasma flow was surprisingly found to be quite different from the fan reconnection of @xcite , since it is found to cross both the spine and fan of the null .",
    "field lines traced from footpoints anchored in the fan - crossing flow are found to flip up and down the spine , whereas those that are traced from the top and bottom of the domain flip around the spine in the fan plane , as envisaged by @xcite .",
    "the reconnection rate is again given by an integral of the form ( [ eq:8 ] ) , this time along the fan field line parallel to the direction of current flow ( here the @xmath75-axis ) .",
    "for such a mode of reconnection this expression can be shown to coincide with the rate of flux transport across the fan ( separatrix ) surface @xcite .",
    "it is possible to find a solution that has similar field line behaviour to the pure fan reconnection envisaged by @xcite , with flow across the spine but not the fan , by adopting instead a field of the form @xmath77 with a fan @xmath75-current @xmath78 ( see ref .",
    "it is also possible to model pure spine reconnection with flow across the fan but not the spine by considering @xmath79 . with a fan @xmath75-current @xmath80 .",
    "both of these fields have a vanishing current at the null .",
    "however , a key property of a null point is the hyperbolic field structure , which tends to focus disturbances and thus generate non - zero currents at the null for the _ primary  reconnection  modes_. the above pure spine and fan solutions should therefore not be considered as fundamental or primary reconnection modes but as _ secondary  reconnection  modes _ in the sense that the current vanishes at the null .",
    "it has been suggested that solutions for spine reconnection in incompressible plasmas @xcite may not be dynamically accessible , and while incompressible fan solutions @xcite are dynamically accessible @xcite , this breaks down when the incompressibility assumption is relaxed @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the generic null point reconnection mode that is observed in numerical experiments in response to shearing motions is one in which there is a strong fan current with flow across both spine and fan , and which is in some sense a combination of the spine and fan reconnection of @xcite .",
    "we propose here to call it _ spine - fan  reconnection _ and discuss its properties further in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "several numerical experiments have been conducted in order to go beyond the constraints of analytical theory and to shed more light on the nature of reconnection at a 3d null .",
    "the aim was also to see whether the types of reconnection envisaged qualitatively could indeed take place in practice and to discover whether any other regimes are possible .",
    "first of all , @xcite investigated propagation of a helical alfvn wave towards the fan plane , launched by a rotational driving of the field lines around the spine .",
    "this led to the concentration of current in the fan plane and suggests the possibility of _ torsional  fan  reconnection _ which we shall propose in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "( for highly impulsive driving coupling to a fast mode wave that wraps around the null was also observed . ) on the other hand @xcite used a resistive mhd code to show how rotational disturbances of field lines in the vicinity of the fan plane can also produce the strong currents along the spine that are symptomatic of _ torsional  spine  reconnection _",
    "( section [ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "then @xcite used an ideal lagrangian relaxation code to follow the formation of current sheets by the collapse of a line - tied 3d null in a compressible plasma .",
    "this was a result of the focussing of externally generated large - scale stresses in the field in response to an initial shearing of either the spine axis or fan plane .",
    "building on a previous linear theory by @xcite , they found that locally the fan and spine collapse towards each other to form a current sheet singularity .",

    "* ) .,title=\"fig : \" ]    this was followed up by @xcite , who used a resistive mhd code to investigate the formation and dissipation of the current sheet in response to shearing of the spine , as shown in figure [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the results support the idea of _ spine - fan  reconnection _ in which current concentrates around the null ( in a sheet spanning the spine and fan ) .",
    "including compressibility does not affect the results qualitatively , except that in the incompressible limit the spine - fan current is found to reduce purely to a fan current @xcite with behaviour closely resembling earlier fan reconnection models @xcite .",
    "so pure _ fan  reconnection _ can be either an incompressible limit of _ spine - fan  reconnection _ or , as we have seen in section [ sec:2c ] , the result of a secondary fan current which vanishes at the null .",
    "the type of reconnection set up at a 3d null depends crucially on the nature of the flows and boundary conditions that are responsible for the reconnection .",
    "let us suppose first that a rotation of the fan plane drives a current along the spine and gives rise to torsional spine reconnection , as sketched in figure [ fig:5]a .",
    "the nature of the reconnection is that in the core of the spine current tube there is rotational slippage , with the field lines becoming disconnected and rotating around the spine ( see @xcite ) : figure [ fig:5]b shows on the left side a particular magnetic field line and its plasma elements at @xmath82 ; in the upper part of the figure ( above the shaded diffusion region ) this field line and its attached plasma elements rotate about the spine through positions at times @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ; in the lower part of the figure ( below the diffusion region ) the plasma elements that were on the field line at @xmath86 rotate to positions at @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 that are on different field lines .    , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , that initially ( @xmath82 ) lay on one field line .",

    "this is a sacrifice made for tractability and pedagogic purposes . for a solution with differentiable physical quantities , see @xcite .    in the above",
    ", the diffusion region was imposed to be a cylinder whose width ( @xmath13 ) and height ( @xmath67 ) are parameters of the solution .",
    "the formation , in a self - consistent fashion , of such a cylindrical diffusion region was observed in the simulations described by @xcite . in one of their simulations they imposed a twisting perturbation of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the fan plane .",
    "as the disturbance propagated inwards towards the null , it was dominated by a helical alfv ' enic wave  travelling along the field lines and thus stretching out along the spine .",
    "the result was a tube of current focussed around the spine , giving a large aspect ratio to the diffusion region ( @xmath177 ) . during the process of torsional spine reconnection",
    "the narrowing and elongation of the current tube is likely to continue until the rotational advection that twists the field and intensifies the current is balanced by the rotational slippage .",
    "now suppose that we rotate the field lines near the spine in opposite directions above and below the fan .",

    "let us follow the approach of section iiia and calculate the pure non - ideal solution",
    ". we shall assume the diffusion region to be a disc of radius @xmath13 and height @xmath67 , with the same diagram as before ( figure 6 ) , except that the diffusion region is now expected to be in the shape of a thin disc ( with @xmath185 ) rather than a thin tube ( with @xmath186 ) .",
    "assuming , as before , that @xmath187 vanishes in regions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we evaluate it in region ( 3 ) by integrating from a point @xmath120 on the top of the disc to a point @xmath122 inside the diffusion region .",
    "after using equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) and the mapping and setting @xmath188 , the expression for the potential at @xmath122 then becomes @xmath189    we adopt the following general form for the magnetic diffusivity inside the diffusion region ( d ) @xmath190 which peaks at the null point and vanishes on the boundary of d when @xmath191 and @xmath192 are positive and @xmath192 is even . after substituting into ( [ eq:21 ] ) and using the mapping and inverse mapping , we find the potential throughout the diffusion region .",
    "in particular , it transpires that an important constraint on the constants @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 is that @xmath193 be finite and continuous at the fan plane . as an example , one set of such constants that works is @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , for which @xmath198 the corresponding components of electric field are @xmath199 @xmath200    in order to find @xmath187 in region ( 4 ) of figure 6 , as before , we calculate its value at any point @xmath121 where a field line leaves the diffusion region , and then project that value along that field line .",

    "this collapse is opposed by the line - tying at the boundaries , and what occurs is that the shear distortion tends to focus in the weak field region in the vicinity of the null point , forming a localised current sheet @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes spine - fan reconnection from the other null point reconnection modes is that flux is transferred across both the spine and fan .",
    "furthermore , the current concentration is in the form of a localised sheet that is inclined at an intermediate angle between the spine and fan  indeed the current sheet contains part of both the spine and the fan ( see figures [ fig:4]b and [ fig:8]a ) . as mentioned above , the reconnection rate for this mode of reconnection is obtained by integrating @xmath228 along the fan field line with the maximum value of @xmath229 . by the symmetry of the simple models described herein , this is the field line parallel to the current orientation at the null ( perpendicular to the applied shear ) .",
    "the reconnection rate thus obtained measures exactly the rate of flux transport in the ideal region across the fan separatrix surface . to illustrate the properties of this mode of null point reconnection",
    ", we describe here briefly the results of resistive mhd simulation runs ( see @xcite for an initial description ) .    in the simulations ,",
    "a shear velocity is prescribed on the ( line - tied ) @xmath8-boundaries , which advects the spine footpoints , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) ( the results are qualitatively the same if the fan is distorted instead ) . the current sheet that forms in response to the shearing",
    "is localised in all three directions about the null",
    ". however , in the plane of the applied shear ( perpendicular to the current orientation at the null ) the magnetic field and current patterns have a similar appearance to a 2d x - point configuration . as one moves away from the null in the fan along the direction of current flow ,",
    "the magnetic field strength parallel to the current ( sometimes known as the ` guide field ' ) strengthens , while the current intensity weakens ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "the boundary shearing velocity is ramped up to a constant value ( @xmath230 ) at which it is held until being ramped down to zero , at @xmath231 ( space and time units in the code are such that an alfv ' en wave would travel one space unit in one time unit for uniform density and magnetic field @xmath232 ) .",
    "the resistivity is uniform .",
    "current focusses at the null during the period when the driving occurs , and when the driving ceases both the current and reconnection rate peak , after which the null gradually relaxes towards its original potential configuration . under continuous driving , it is unclear whether a true steady state would be set up , or whether the current sheet would continually grow in dimensions and intensity ( see ref .",
    "this is an open question for future study . for the case of transient driving , the peak current and reconnection rate increase linearly with the driving velocity .",
    "here we examine more closely the sheet geometry , and its scaling with the driving velocity , and also investigate the scaling of this geometry , the peak current and peak reconnection rate with resistivity .",
    "as previously noted , the current sheet that forms in spine - fan reconnection is focussed at the null , locally spanning both the spine and fan .",
    "the sheet has a tendency to spread along the fan depending on the parameters chosen ( spreading is enhanced by lowering @xmath230 or increasing the plasma-@xmath233 ) .",
    "we examine four spatial measurements ( see figure [ fig:8]b ) associated with the current sheet , focussing on the time when the current magnitude is a maximum and defining the boundary of the sheet to be an isosurface at 50% of @xmath234 .",

    "the angle @xmath237 between the current sheet and the @xmath31 plane can be seen to increase as the driving velocity increases .",
    "this can be put down to the fact that the stronger driving creates a stronger lorentz force  the force that is responsible for the collapse .",
    "as expected , @xmath235 increases as @xmath230 increases .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the spine footpoints are sheared further for larger @xmath230 , and there exists in fact a close correspondence ; @xmath239 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath235 , @xmath225 shows a linear _ decrease _ with @xmath230 ( as does @xmath236 , see ref .",

    "the decline in @xmath225 with increasing @xmath230 must of course cease once @xmath240 , as is the case for the strongest driving considered .",
    "examining finally the sheet thickness @xmath224 , any variation is within the error bars of our measurements , and moreover the resolution is not sufficient for firm conclusions to be drawn .",
    "we turn now to consider the scaling of the current sheet with @xmath58 , setting @xmath241 , see figure [ fig:10 ] . as @xmath58 decreases ,",
    "@xmath242 increases , while the reconnection rate decreases . in both cases , with the limited data of this preliminary study , the proportionality appears to be somewhere between power law and logarithmic . that the run with the largest resistivity does not seem to fit the trend for the reconnection rate is likely to be because the current significantly dissipates before reaching the null itself due to the high resistivity ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "accompanying the increase in @xmath242 with @xmath58 is , as expected , a decrease in the thickness @xmath224 .",
    "on the other hand , the overall dimensions of the sheet , @xmath225 and @xmath236 , seem to be unaffected by @xmath58 , to within our measurement accuracy .",

    "we have here outlined a new categorisation of reconnection regimes at a 3d null point . in place of the two previous types , namely , spine and fan reconnection",
    ", we suggest that three distinct generic modes of null point reconnection are likely to occur .",
    "the first two are caused by rotational motions , either of the fan or of the spine , leading to either _ torsional spine reconnection _ or _ torsional fan reconnection_. these involve slippage of field lines in either the spine or the fan , which is quite different from classical 2d reconnection , but does involve a change of magnetic connection of plasma elements .",
    "even though pure spine or fan reconnection may occur in special situations ( such as when @xmath244 or there are high - order currents ) , it is much more likely in practice that a hybrid type of reconnection takes place that we refer to as _ spine - fan reconnection_. this is the most common form of reconnection that we expect to see in three dimensions at a null point , since it is a natural response to a shearing of the null point .",
    "it is most similar of all the 3d reconnection regimes to classical 2d reconnection and involves transfer of magnetic flux across both the spine and the fan .",
    "it possesses a diffusion region in the form of a current sheet that is inclined to the fan and spine and has current localised in both the spine and fan , focussed at the null .    in future ,",
    "much remains to be determined about these new regimes of reconnection that have been observed in numerical experiments .",
    "one is the shape and dimensions of the diffusion regions and their relation to the driving velocity and the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "another key question is : what is the rate of reconnection at realistic plasma parameters , and is there a maximum value ?",
    "since the analytical theory is so hard in three dimensions , progress is likely to be inspired by future carefully designed numerical experiments .",
