    "sne ib / c ( type ib and ic supernovae ) are hydrogen free , or nearly hydrogen free , and are thought to have stripped massive star core , i.e. wolf - rayet star , progenitors",
    ". the observed rate of sne ib / c indicates that they make up about 1/4 of massive star supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and thus are an important mode of massive star death .",
    "although single very massive stars may end their lives as wolf - rayet stars , they are probably not in sufficient numbers to account for all of the sne ib / c @xcite ; binary progenitors are likely to be important contributors to the rate .",
    "considerable interest in sne ib / c has been generated by their relation to grbs ( gamma - ray bursts ) .",
    "the spatial and temporal correlation of the type ic sn 1998bw with the burst grb 980425 led to the probability of a chance superposition of only @xmath2 @xcite , and the extraordinary energy displayed by the optical @xcite and radio @xcite emission from the supernova made the identification even more secure .",
    "the case was clinched by the finding of type ic supernovae similar to sn 1998bw in the cosmological grbs 030329 and 031203 @xcite .",
    "the broad line character of the optical spectrum of sn 1998bw , with velocities up to @xmath3 , led to the view that sne ib / c with such broad lines were likely to be related to grbs , including sn 2002ap @xcite .",
    "however , sn 2002ap was a relatively weak radio @xcite and x - ray source .",
    "on the basis of the radio emission , @xcite argued that the energy in high velocity ejecta was low , so that a connection to grbs was unlikely for this object .",
    "although it is not known which sne ib / c have a grb connection , it is clear at least some of them do and this led to the prediction that late radio observations of sne ib / c could yield the detection of an off - axis grb jet that slowed down and radiated more isotropically @xcite .",
    "searches for such emission were undertaken @xcite , leading to the detection of luminous radio and x - ray emission from sn 2001em @xcite , sn 2003l @xcite , and sn2003bg @xcite . in the case of sn 2003l , broad - lined optical emission is not present @xcite , and in no case is there direct evidence for a grb connection .",
    "sne ib / c were generally not detected at radio wavelengths , showing that such luminous supernovae are rare @xcite .",
    "although there have been discussions of the radio and x - ray emission from individual sneib / c , there has been little discussion of their overall properties and how they relate to the mass loss properties of the progenitor star .",
    "we consider these properties and discuss the mechanisms for x - ray emission from the supernovae . in   2 , the observed properties of sne ib / c are briefly reviewed .",
    "the hydrodynamics of the interaction and the resulting velocities are estimated in   3 .",
    "the expected relativistic electron spectrum , allowing for loss processes , is treated in   4 and the resulting synchrotron radio emission in   5 .",
    "the possible mechanisms for the x - ray emission and their application to the observations are discussed in   6 .",
    "a discussion of the results is in   7 .",
    "clear signs of circumstellar interaction in sne ib / c are not present at optical wavelengths , but are seen at radio and x - ray wavelengths .",

    "sn 2001ig was observed to have h lines in its spectrum at one point , but some of its properties point to a wolf - rayet star progenitor @xcite , so we include it here .    the light curves for the radio supernovae show an early increase followed by a decline .",
    "the peak spectral luminosity and time of peak for various supernovae are shown in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "if ssa ( synchrotron self - absorption ) is the dominant absorption process , the position of the supernovae in this plot gives an indication of the velocity of the radio emitting shell @xcite .",
    "sne ib / c generally separate themselves from other supernovae in this plot by having high velocities .",
    "the type ic sn 1998bw , associated with grb 980425 , stands out even more by requiring relativistic motion .",
    "other type ic supernovae associated with grbs , e.g. , sn 2003dh with grb 030329 and sn 2003lw with grb 031203 , had radio properties indicating highly relativistic motion . in these last two cases ,",
    "the radio emission is generally believed to be associated with power from the same central engine that caused the grb .",
    "the case of sn 1998bw has been more controversial . @xcite",
    "suggest an association with the grb power source , but others have argued for a supernova origin for the radio and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "other than sn 1998bw , we do not treat the sne ic associated with grbs here .",
    "one quantity of interest that can be found from radio observations in the optically thin regime is the energy spectral index of the synchrotron emitting electrons .",
    "the values of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , are given in table 1 .",
    "these values cover a range of times , but go to as late as several hundred days in some cases .",
    "the corresponding energy spectral index is @xmath6 for these supernovae .",
    "the spectral indices are generally steeper for the sne ib / c than for other types of supernovae .",
    "table 1 also gives @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , in the optically thin regime .",
    "the uncertainties in these values are @xmath9 and vary among the different objects .",
    "there are only a few data points for sn 1984l , so those results are especially uncertain .",
    "sn 2001ig and sn 2003bg both showed jumps in their light curves ; the numbers used here do not include those parts of the light curves .",
    "sne ib / c generally have no more than a few x - ray observations , so there is no complete light curve information .",
    "table 2 lists the current observations , including the unabsorbed luminosities , of sne ib / c ; all the detections are of type ic objects , which are the ones without he lines .",
    "the distances in table 2 and 3 are based on @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 . for sn 2003l and sn 2003bg",
    ", the distances are based on the recession velocity of the host galaxy and this value of @xmath12 ; in all the other cases , the distances of @xcite have been scaled to @xmath10 from their assumed value of 75 . the resulting distance",
    "to sn 2002ap , 10.4 mpc , is at the high end of the range of distances typically chosen for this supernova , but we are especially interested in having a consistent set of relative distances .",
    "sn 1994i in m51 was detected by _",
    "chandra _ at an age of @xmath13 years @xcite ; apparently it was detected at a later age in x - rays than in any other wavelength band .",
    "the hydrodynamic interaction between a supernova and its surroundings depends on the density structure of the freely expanding supernova ejecta and the structure of the circumstellar medium . if sne ib / c have wolf - rayet progenitors , typical wind properties are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we define a constant to specify the wind density @xmath16 , with a reference value @xmath17 corresponding to the typical wind properties . because of the high wind velocity , the supernova shock samples a region of recent mass loss , so the assumption of steady mass loss and a @xmath18 density profile is reasonable . for the mass loss rates and wind velocities determined by @xcite for galactic wolf - rayet stars , @xmath19 ranges from @xmath20 .",
    "the low value is for a wo star with @xmath21 .",
    "if the supernova shock moves out at @xmath22 and the wind velocity is @xmath23 , then the age of the wind that is sampled by the supernova is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the age of the supernova .",
    "since @xmath25 is typically @xmath26 a few years for observed sne ib / c , the radio emission is sensitive to changes in the mass loss properties on only a short timescale before the explosion ( @xmath27 yr ) . if a slow wind were present from an earlier evolutionary phase , a longer timescale for change would be possible because of the slower wind velocity ; this may have occurred in the type ib / c sn 2001em @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss that situation any further here .",
    "a number of studies of sne ib / c have quoted mass loss rates assuming a wind velocity of @xmath28 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a rationale for a low velocity is that the wind is from a late type companion with a slow wind .",
    "however , the ram pressure of a wolf - rayet star wind is likely to dominate that of any companion star .",
    "@xcite address this by suggesting that sne ib / c are the thermonuclear explosions of cores .",
    "the further study of sne ib / c has supported the wolf - rayet hypothesis for their progenitors and we assume a fast wind here .",
    "when they occur in binary systems , the wolf - rayet wind can sweep back the companion star wind .",
    "the spiral structure that then results from the binary motion has been observed in some wolf - rayet systems @xcite .",
    "the supernova structure depends on explosion models .",
    "@xcite discussed the density profiles resulting from the explosions of stars with radiative envelopes , as expected for sne ib / c progenitors .",
    "radiative losses at the time of shock breakout set the upper limit to the velocity of the material that is shock accelerated at the outer edge of the star .",
    "the maximum velocity can be expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath31 ergs , @xmath32 is the ejecta mass , @xmath33 is the progenitor radius ( @xmath34 is typical for a wolf - rayet star ) , and typical values have been used for the opacity and the progenitor density structure .",
    "the resulting density profile , approximately a steep outer power law and a shallow inner power law , can be scaled with the ejecta mass , @xmath32 , and energy @xmath30 .",
    "models of the optical light curves and spectra of particular supernovae lead to estimates of @xmath32 and @xmath30 . the outer density structure can be written as @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 for the freely expanding gas and cgs units are used for the coefficient .",
    "the interaction of the steep outer power law structure with the surrounding wind can be described by a self - similar solution for a @xmath37 fluid @xcite .",
    "the solution should apply at early times and can be used to find the radius of the contact discontinuity between the ejecta and the circumstellar gas , @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the age in units of 10 days .",
    "the forward shock is at @xmath41 and the reverse shock at @xmath42 .",
    "the density at the reverse shock is 29 times that at the forward shock and the mass of shocked ejecta is 2.0 times that of swept up circumstellar medium . in this solution ,",
    "the fraction of the volume within the outer shock wave occupied by shocked gas is @xmath43 , which is made up of shocked circumstellar gas ( @xmath44 ) and shocked ejecta ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "combining equations ( [ vmax ] ) and ( [ rsh ] ) gives the approximate time at which interaction with the power law profile begins @xmath46 this is earlier than the time at which radio supernovae are observed , so the initial hydrodynamic evolution is expected to be in the self - similar regime of interaction with a steep power law .",
    "deviations from self - similar behavior are expected when the reverse shock front moves into the interior , flatter part of the supernova density profile . to estimate the importance of this effect",
    ", we use the harmonic mean density distribution of @xcite .",
    "results for a particular density profile can be scaled to any appropriate values of stellar mass , @xmath32 , explosion energy , @xmath30 , and circumstellar density , @xmath47 , using the scaling laws that lengths @xmath48 and time @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "we use results for the interaction in the thin shell approximation , as described by @xcite .",
    "these results show that at an age @xmath53 the value of @xmath54 , corresponding to @xmath55 . this value is close to the initial value , so that the assumption of self - similar evolution over the time of observation of radio supernovae ( at most up to a few years old ) is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the density structure advocated here can be compared to that found by other groups .",
    "the model co100 has been used by mazzali and collaborators to model energetic type ic supernovae ( see fig",
    ". 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for the density structure ) .",
    "the high velocity ( @xmath56 ) end of this structure can be approximated by a steep power law ( @xmath57 ) , in reasonable agreement with the model used here .",
    "however , @xcite find that the spectroscopic modeling of the broad - line type ic sn 1997ef is improved by having a relatively flat density profile ( @xmath58 ) over the velocity range @xmath59 .",
    "if the reverse shock wave of the interaction region propagated into such a shallow density gradient , the forward shock wave would begin to evolve toward @xmath60 blast wave expansion .",
    "although the self - similar solution is expected to be adequate for the typical case , there may be circumstances where it fails .",
    "one is if there is a combination of high @xmath30 , low @xmath32 , and low @xmath19 so that the flow is relativistic ; this requires @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 , or @xmath64 in equation ( [ rsh ] ) . @xcite",
    "have discussed the supernova structure for the case where the accelerating shock at the outer edge of the star becomes relativistic . however , equation ( [ rsh ] ) shows that even for @xmath65 the shock velocity is not relativistic for radio and x - ray supernovae at typical times of observation .",
    "another circumstance is recent change from a different stellar evolutionary phase , as described above .",
    "deviations from the @xmath37 energy - conserving self - similar solution are expected if radiative cooling of the gas is important . for the hydrodynamic model described above , the velocity of gas moving into the reverse shock is @xmath66 and the preshock density is @xmath67 unless the ejecta are very heavy element rich , the radiative cooling is dominated by free - free emission ( see   6.1 ) and the cooling time is larger than the age of the supernova even at @xmath68 day .",
    "the temperature gradually declines with time , but the density also declines and the cooling time remains larger than the age . the temperature at the outer shock is higher and density lower , so the cooling times are even longer .",
    "this justifies the use of the nonradiative self - similar solution .",
    "another effect that can change the structure is the efficient acceleration of relativistic particles .",
    "if relativistic particles are an important contributor to the pressure , the adiabatic index approaches @xmath69 and the compression ratio in the shock front is increased .",
    "the result is a decrease in the width of the shocked region @xcite .",
    "if there are losses of relativistic particles from the shocked region , the compression in the shocked region is increased further ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "particle acceleration is most likely to occur at the shock fronts resulting from the interaction .",
    "there are reasons to believe that the forward shock dominates the reverse shock in contributing to the relativistic particle component .",
    "the forward shock has a higher velocity , postshock energy density , and volume of shocked gas .",
    "in addition , the preshock magnetic field at the reverse shock is small because of the expansion of the supernova . in the case of tycho s supernova remnant , @xcite have argued on the basis of x - ray observations that the particle acceleration is primarily at the forward shock and not at the reverse shock .",
    "loss processes that can affect the particle distribution are synchrotron losses and inverse compton losses .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath70 of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the preshock circumstellar density and @xmath73 is the forward shock velocity , is converted to magnetic energy density , @xmath74 , so that @xmath75 where @xmath76 is @xmath77 and @xmath40 is the age in units of 10 days .",
    "the value of @xmath78 for the reference parameters is 1.1 g. assuming that electrons radiate at their critical synchrotron frequency , the lorentz factor of electrons radiating at frequency @xmath79 is @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time can then be written as @xmath82 and the critical frequency at which the synchrotron cooling time equals the age is @xmath83 it can be seen that synchrotron cooling is typically not important when considering radio emission , but is important when considering x - ray emission . if the electron shock acceleration extends to a high energy , the effect of synchrotron cooling is to steepen the energy spectrum from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , inverse compton losses can be significant when considering the radio emission from a type ic supernova .",

    "the ratio of synchrotron cooling time to inverse compton cooling time is @xmath90 after maximum light , the luminosity @xmath87 drops more rapidly than @xmath91 , so synchrotron cooling is expected to be the dominant cooling process .    assuming that the maximum energy to which electrons are accelerated , @xmath92 , is limited by synchrotron losses",

    "the above considerations show that synchrotron losses typically do dominate , except near maximum optical light when @xmath98 for the standard parameters . even in this case",
    ", the emission should extend to x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time is much less than the age at these high frequencies , so the supernova age is not a limiting factor in determining the maximum particle energy .    as noted in   2 ,",
    "radio observations of sne ib / c indicate an energy spectral index @xmath99 over a broad range of times .",
    "the fact that synchrotron and inverse compton losses are unlikely to affect the spectrum implies that this is the injection spectrum for the radiating particles .",

    "higher energy particles experience a higher degree of compression and thus have a flatter spectrum ; there is the possibility of curvature in the spectrum",
    ". the total compression can be @xmath104 ( leading to @xmath105 ) because of the relativistic contribution to the equation of state and the loss of high energy particles from the shock region .    at the high shock velocities in sne ib / c ,",

    "the predicted velocity ratio is 3.2 , whereas the observed is 3.3 ; the high velocity in sn 2002ap can be attributed to the low circumstellar density and early time of observation .",

    "circumstellar x - ray absorption is expected to be negligible for sne ib / c .",

    "one type of inverse compton emission is scattering of photospheric photons with thermal hot electrons in the shock interaction region @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that this mechanism is responsible for the x - ray emission observed from sn 2002ap .",
    "however , the required electron optical depth and position of the hot electrons are not compatible with the hydrodynamic situation expected in sn 2002ap , and inverse compton scattering of photospheric photons by relativistic electrons is more plausible @xcite .",

    "the radio emission gives the quantity @xmath203 , so that equation ( [ eq11 ] ) becomes @xmath204 the epsilon parameters now enter only through the ratio @xmath146 .",
    "predictions of the x - ray luminosity using equation ( [ eq12 ] ) are given in table 4 , where the values of @xmath205 have been taken from the velocity at peak radio luminosity ( table 3 ) and evolved to the time of the x - ray observation .",

    "no direct optical observations of sn 1994i at an age of 7 years are available , but estimates of the luminosity are possible by analogy to sn 1987a . at an age of 7 years , sn 1987a had faded by 15 magnitudes from maximum light @xcite , to @xmath207 .",
    "the power input is presumably from @xmath208ti at this age and sne ib / c are estimated to have @xmath209 of @xmath208ti synthesized in the explosion @xcite , comparable to the @xmath210 of @xmath208ti estimated for sn 1987a .",
    "in addition , the estimated mass of @xmath211ni , @xmath212 @xcite , is comparable to that ejected in sn 1987a .",
    "the late luminosity of sn 1994i , is probably considerably less that @xmath213 because the ejected mass in sn 1994i , @xmath214 @xcite , is much less than that of sn 1987a and the ejecta are less able to absorb the radioactive power .",
    "there is not a published optical light curve for sn 2001ig , so we used amateur photometric measures @xcite to estimate the bolometric luminosity for this case .",
    "the results show varying degrees of agreement with the observed x - ray luminosities .",
    "the observation that is most consistent with the expectations from inverse compton is the early observation of sn 2002ap , which is in agreement with the interpretation of @xcite .",
    "the other predictions of inverse compton emission are lower than expected , and require high values of @xmath146 to come into agreement with the observed luminosities .",
    "a problem with departures from energy equipartition of magnetic fields and electrons ( @xmath215 ) is that we argued for @xmath216 in order to approximately reproduce the range of wolf - rayet wind densities .",
    "because the @xmath162 s are expected to be @xmath217 , the possible departure from equipartition is limited ; this argument especially applies to the radio luminous supernovae ( sn 2003l and sn 2003bg ) .",
    "a general expectation of the inverse compton model is the relation between the optical luminosity and the inverse compton luminosity ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq12 ] ] ) ; this relation is not shared by other mechanisms ( thermal and synchrotron ) . the existing x - ray observations do not provide good light curve coverage , but , where multiple epochs do exist , they do not show the expected relation . the large decline expected between days 30 and 120 for sn 2003bg does not appear in the observed fluxes , which argues against the inverse compton mechanism , at least at the late time .",
    "for sn 1994i , the inverse compton definitely fails to explain the late time observations , as will be shown explicitly in  [ sec_synch ] .",
    "searches for inverse compton emission should concentrate on observations around the time of maximum optical light .      because of the lack of a detailed theory for the acceleration of relativistic electrons , the x - ray synchrotron emission is typically estimated by extending the radio synchrotron emission into the x - ray regime . in view of the relatively steep spectra of sne ib / c and further steepening expected from synchrotron losses , a simple extrapolation of the optically thin radio emission leads to a low x - ray luminosity .",
    "table 2 gives the value of @xmath218 for the various supernovae at 5 ghz ; in cases where there are no radio observations at the time of the x - ray observations or the emission is optically thick at 5 ghz , a rough extrapolation of the radio evolution has been made . with @xmath219 , as is approximately observed in these supernovae , the quantity @xmath218 stays constant with frequency .",
    "it can be seen that the x - ray luminosity is above this extrapolation ( table 4 ) ; if synchrotron losses to the electron spectrum were included , the discrepancy would be larger .",
    "it is for this reason that the synchrotron mechanism is generally not found to be viable for x - ray supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* on sn 2003l ) .",
    "however , as described in   [ sp ] , the nonlinear theory of particle acceleration predicts that the electron spectrum becomes flatter for @xmath220 .",
    "we use an approximate version of this theory to estimate whether synchrotron emission can account for the late emission from sn 1994i .",
    "following @xcite , we assume power law segments for the electron energy distribution . below @xmath221",

    "this injection spectrum for the particles extends to x - ray emitting particles , as argued above .",

    "the synchrotron mechanism is thus able to approximately account for the late x - ray emission from sn 1994i in the context of a particle spectrum formed in a cosmic ray dominated shock .",
    "equation ( [ xray ] ) shows that , with the synchrotron mechanism , the evolution of @xmath234 is flatter than @xmath235 by one power of @xmath25 . for",
    "the radio evolution observed for sn 1994i ( table 1 ) , the predicted evolution is @xmath236 .",
    "although this gives an estimate of the expected emission , we have carried out more detailed calculations of the effects of synchrotron and inverse compton radiation on the particle spectrum and emission , using the methods of @xcite .",

    "these results confirm that the cosmic ray dominated shock model can explain the observed x - ray emission on day @xmath242 .",
    "the model is also consistent with the observed upper limit on day 52 , but falls below the detection on day 82 .",
    "however , the early detection of sn 1994i did not have high statistical significance : @xmath243 in a 6.4 ks observation and @xmath244 in a 29.9 ks observation with rosat @xcite .",
    "1 shows that the x - ray light curves have an imprint of the optical light curve due to inverse compton radiation near maximum light .",

    "there is a strong inverse compton component extending from the ultraviolet to the x - rays . at 30 days this has almost disappeared .",
    "the curvature of the synchrotron component is apparent , especially at 10 days when the radio range is also affected by cooling . for sn 1994i",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility of late dense circumstellar interaction giving rise to thermal x - ray emission because there are not simultaneous observations at other wavelengths . in our model , this would require dense matter at some distance from the supernova , as appears to be the case in sn 2001em @xcite .",
    "our suggestion of late synchrotron emission from a type ic like sn 1994i needs confirmation from more complete x - ray observations of a similar event .",
    "spectral observations would provide the most direct constraints , but as fig .",
    "1 shows , the evolution of the x - ray light curve can also discrimnate between different mechanisms .",
    "none of the supernovae discussed so far have a clear connection with grbs and the emission can be accounted for by an interaction region driven by the fast outer supernova ejecta .",
    "sn 1998bw was observed as a bright sn ic and was associated with grb 980425 .",
    "the early turn - on of the radio emission suggests mildly relativistic expansion in the synchrotron self - absorption model @xcite ; this implies that the nonrelativistic analysis presented here may not be accurate , but it can still be expected to give approximate results .",
    "the early peak emission ( 42 mjy 5 ghz flux at 13 days ) implies @xmath245 . for a comparable efficiency of magnetic field production ,",

    "inverse compton scattering of photospheric photons would decline much more rapidly after maximum light , so synchrotron emission is the most likely emission mechanism .",
    "the radio emission has an optically thin spectral index @xmath248 , implying @xmath249 .",
    "if the observed flux at @xmath250 days is extended to the x - ray range , the luminosity falls short of the observed x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath247 . considering that synchrotron losses can further decrease the x - ray flux by 20 ,",
    "the radio through x - ray emission is not consistent with injection of electrons with a single power law index . as discussed above",
    ", there are reasons to believe that the energy index might flatten at high energy if the shock waves are cosmic ray dominated . in this case",

    ", the x - ray emission could originate from a different region from the radio .",
    "@xcite discuss the possibility that the x - ray emission is related to off - axis emission from a fast jet related to the gamma - ray burst .",
    "we have found that the radio and x - ray emission from sne ib / c can be accounted for by supernova interaction with the wind from the wolf - rayet star progenitor . following the arguments of @xcite , synchrotron self - absorption is generally responsible for the early absorption of the radio emission . the radio synchrotron emission from most of the sne ib / c considered here imply an electron energy index @xmath99 .",
    "the radio spectral index of sn 1998bw is distinctly flatter , with @xmath249 .",
    "the only other sn ib / c with a relatively flat spectrum is sn 2002ap , with @xmath130 in the model of @xcite .",
    "interestingly , sn 2002ap has the highest velocity of any of the supernova in our group of normal ib / c events .",
    "it may be that as the shock velocity increases and relativistic effects become important , there are changes in the character of the particle acceleration .",

    "if the circumstellar densities are typical of wolf - rayet stars , thermal radiation can not explain the observed x - ray emission and a nonthermal mechanism is required . although inverse compton scattering of photospheric photons might be able to explain x - ray emission close to maximum optical light , it generally fails to explain late emission .",
    "if this emission is synchrotron radiation , there must be a flattening of the particle spectrum at high energy , as can occur in diffusive acceleration in cosmic ray dominated shock waves .",
    "more detailed x - ray observations are needed to confirm this picture .",
    "we expect the early x - ray luminosity to be related to the optical luminosity of the supernova if it is inverse compton emission ; as the supernova fades , synchrotron emission may become the dominant mechanism , with a relatively slow rate of decline .    an additional piece of information from our interpretation is the magnetic field in the shocked region . if the circumstellar densities are typical of wolf - rayet stars , we find that efficient amplification of magnetic fields is needed , with @xmath252 .",
    "a possible reason for the field is a streaming instability that accompanies cosmic ray acceleration @xcite , which may explain the high amplification at the high shock velocities present in sne ib / c . with this mechanism , @xmath253 ,",
