    "the thermopower or seebeck coefficient @xmath3 of a system is the electric voltage @xmath4 generated in response to an imposed temperature difference @xmath5 across its ends . in an electron system thermally connected to a phonon bath , the primary contributions to @xmath4 are from `` phonon drag , '' which is driven by electron - phonon scattering , and the diffusive kinetics of the electrons themselves in order to maintain local thermal equilibrium .",
    "the latter is dominant at sufficiently low temperatures when most phonons freeze out and is called the diffusion thermopower ( @xmath6 ) . within the semiclassical boltzmann framework , the diffusion thermopower is given by the mott relation  @xcite and connects it to the conductivity @xmath7 of the system as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath10 is the average electron temperature , @xmath11 is the charge of the carriers , @xmath12 is the energy , and @xmath13 is the chemical potential of the system .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is sensitive to the energy - derivative of @xmath7 and consequently various system parameters such as the electronic density of states ( dos ) and the momentum relaxation time @xmath14 .",
    "this sets it apart from the resistivity as a spectroscopic tool and the physics it probes .",
    "for instance , the @xmath10  dependence of @xmath3 is markedly different for metals , anderson insulators , and gapped insulators : for metals , where there is a continuous dos and free charge carriers , @xmath15 decreases to zero linearly as @xmath16 ; for 2d anderson insulators which are characterized by a sharp mobility edge separating the conducting ( extended ) and nonconducting ( localized ) states in an otherwise continuous dos , @xmath15 varies as @xmath17 ; in the efros - shklovskii regime , where coulomb interactions cause the opening of a soft gap at the fermi energy in the dos , @xmath18 constant as @xmath19 ; and finally , for hard gapped insulators @xmath15 diverges as @xmath20 .",
    "these distinctions are far less pronounced in the resistivity @xmath21 .",
    "another virtue of @xmath3 is its equivalence to the entropy per carrier , thus providing a probe of this abstract quantity .",
    "we note here that the mott formula [ eq .",

    "a heating current @xmath22 establishes a temperature gradient along the length of the device.,width=312 ]    the theromopower has proved to be a powerful tool to probe many - body phases in strongly interacting 2dess , particularly those involving transitions from insulating to either metallic or fractional quantum hall liquid phases . in the presence of strong transverse magnetic fields ,",
    "the thermopower has been employed to investigate the nature of the insulating state near the @xmath23 fractional quantum hall state  @xcite , the existence of an energy gap at the @xmath24 fractional quantum hall state  @xcite , and the possibility of a wigner crystalline ground state near @xmath25 in a bilayer gaas / algaas hole system  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a metallic ground state in low - density 2dess at zero magnetic field , where the metallicity is driven purely by coulomb interactions , has however been far more controversial  @xcite . several attempts to identify such",
    "a metal have been made with thermopower as a probe in the apparently metallic regime , notably in low - density 2d electron or hole systems  @xcite and high - mobility si mosfets  @xcite . while these studies indicate a definite change in the conduction mechanism and/or critical behavior in thermopower near the transition point between insulator and apparent metal , an unambiguous demonstration of a metallic state has never been achieved .",
    "much of the uncertainty could be due to the very nature of the transition which has been suggested to be an inhomogeneity - driven , classical percolation transition  @xcite rather than an interaction - induced one .",
    "recently , the possibility of a metallic phase in strongly interacting 2dess in zero magnetic field has resurfaced through transport experiments with micron - scale 2dess in gaas / algaas heterostructures  @xcite . the motivation behind using micron - sized or `` mesoscopic '' samples was to circumvent the influence of the long - ranged disorder known to exist in molecular - beam - epitaxy - grown gaas / algaas heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "this greatly reduces the tendency of the 2des to fragment into puddles and , consequently , the chances that the transport be governed by percolation through these puddles . indeed , at low @xmath26 , baenninger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite observed striking behavior in mesoscopic 2dess : the @xmath10  dependence of the resistance weakened drastically either saturating to a finite value or decreasing with decreasing @xmath10 even though the absolute value of resistivity exceeded @xmath2 by several orders of magnitude .",

    "this strongly suggests that these oscillations are not a result of coulomb blockade in electron puddles .",
    "two outstanding questions remain : first , can the nature of the metallic state be understood within an effective semiclassical boltzmann framework ? and second , why is @xmath3 two hundred times larger than that expected from the non - interacting model at low @xmath26 ? in the drude - like metal described by eq .",

    "have been suggested to lead to extended , or at least relatively less localized , electron wave functions in the ground state thereby modifying the single - electron conduction mechanism ( see for example ref .",
    "moreover , a common effect of interactions at low temperatures is to induce broken - symmetry states such as wigner crystals , stripe / bubble phases  @xcite etc .",
    "recently , the metal - like electrical transport observed in refs .",
    "@xcite and  koushik was attributed to the melting of spontaneous symmetry - broken states  @xcite , where the melting transition proceeds through the proliferation of topological defects that form delocalized quasiparticles at sufficiently low temperatures where zero - point fluctuations dominate  @xcite .",
    "the signature of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) melting transition was indeed observed in all our devices [ insets of figs .",
    "[ kt](a )  [ kt](c ) ] , where the resistivity @xmath32 varies as @xmath109 , @xmath110 being a constant and @xmath111 the melting density  @xcite . the corresponding delocalized excitations can be responsible for thermal transport as well , and being much smaller than the number of electrons in the system , may lead to very large thermopower .",
    "we note that though wigner crystallisation is expected at much lower @xmath26 in disorder - free systems  @xcite , the presence of disorder may `` pin '' the order and allow finite grain - size wigner crystallites at much higher @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "thus , in conclusion , the effects of the many - body coulomb potential appear to manifest in a novel metallic phase in dilute mesoscopic 2dess , with giant thermopower that decreases linearly as @xmath16 . while we can not rule out the possibility that the system turns insulating at even lower @xmath10 , the fact that it persists down to lowest experimental @xmath26 explored here indicates that the metallic phase might be the true ground state of strongly interacting 2dess .",

    "<S> we present thermal and electrical transport measurements of low - density ( 10@xmath0  m@xmath1 ) , mesoscopic two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) in gaas / algaas heterostructures at sub - kelvin temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even in the supposedly strongly localized regime , where the electrical resistivity of the system is two orders of magnitude greater than the quantum of resistance @xmath2 , the thermopower decreases linearly with temperature indicating metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the magnitude of the thermopower exceeds the predicted value in noninteracting metallic 2dess at similar carrier densities by over two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate a new quantum state and possibly a novel class of itinerant quasiparticles in dilute 2dess at low temperatures where the coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role . </S>"
