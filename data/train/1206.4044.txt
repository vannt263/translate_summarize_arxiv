    "binaries have played a central role in the study of the coolest dwarfs over the last two decades .",
    "each advance that has led to creation of a later spectral type has benefitted from discovery of companions to higher mass objects .",
    "the first l  dwarf , gd  165b , was found as a companion to a white dwarf @xcite . at the time ,",
    "its unusual optical spectrum compared to late - m dwarfs was puzzling , but with the subsequent discovery of more l  dwarfs , it became apparent that gd  165b was the prototype of a new spectral type @xcite .",
    "the first t  dwarf , gl  229b , was found around an m  dwarf @xcite , and its uniqueness was evident from the strong  and  in its near - ir spectrum @xcite .",
    "just last year , two low - mass companions were found with temperatures of only @xmath0300400  k , one being a tight ( 3  au ) companion to the t9.5  dwarf  @xcite and the other being a very wide ( 2500  au ) companion to the white dwarf gj  3483 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of these objects has not been possible yet , due to the small angular separation ( 0.11 ) of  and the lack of a near - ir detection for gj 3483b ( a.k.a .",
    "wd  0806@xmath4661b ) . however , their exceptionally faint absolute magnitudes showed these two objects were novel compared to all previously known t  dwarfs . their temperatures ,",
    "as inferred from their absolute magnitudes using evolutionary models , are far cooler than the previous record - holder , the @xmath0520  k t10  dwarf @xcite , and place the two companions in _ terra incognita _ where theoretical models predict the onset of new photospheric signatures including  absorption in the near - ir , the disappearance of neutral alkali lines , and the formation of water clouds @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have identified five free - floating objects with sufficiently distinct near - ir spectra to propose classification as y  dwarfs , based on the likely presence of  absorption in the blue wing of their @xmath1-band continuua .",
    "while reliable parallaxes are not yet available for these objects and thus their absolute magnitudes are uncertain , model atmosphere fits indicate temperatures of @xmath0300500  k. their novel near - ir appearance may be a precursor to even more significant changes along the remaining temperature gap down to jupiter ( 124  k ; @xcite ) .",
    "as part of our ongoing effort to study low - temperature objects using substellar binaries , we present here the discovery of two extraordinarily well - resolved binaries that shed light on the transition from the latest t  dwarfs to the y  dwarfs .",
    "the primaries , wisepc  j121756.91 + 162640.2 and wisepa j171104.60 + 350036.8 ( hereinafter wise  j1217 + 1626  and wise  j1711 + 3500 ) , were found from a mid - ir search of the solar neighborhood by @xcite , who asssigned integrated - light near - ir spectral types of t9 and t8 , respectively .",
    "we also present improved near - ir imaging of .",
    "our characterization of these three binaries includes resolved photometry in the @xmath5 band , which spans the @xmath01.0  transmission window of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "a broadband filter in this window is a new capability for adaptive optics imaging at keck , just installed in september  2011 .",
    "one of the prime motivating factors for its procurement , as a collaboration between one of us ( m. liu ) and keck observatory , is to explore the @xmath01  fluxes of the coolest substellar objects , which can be diagnostic of surface gravity , metallicity , and photospheric chemistry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we imaged wise  j1217 + 1626 , wise  j1711 + 3500 , and  over 3  nights in january and april  2012 using the laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs ao ) system of the 10-meter keck  ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii @xcite . for wise  j1217 + 1626",
    ", we used the facility ir camera nirc2 with its wide field - of - view optics ( @xmath6 ) , and for wise  j1711 + 3500  and  we used the narrow field - of - view optics ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "conditions were photometric , with 0.8  seeing in january and 0.40.6  seeing in april .",
    "the lgs provided the wavefront reference source for ao correction , with the tip - tilt motion measured simultaneously using @xmath8 , 14.4 , and 15.5  mag stars from the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite located 38 , 43 , and 55away from wise  j1217 + 1626 , wise  j1711 + 3500 , and , respectively .",
    "the lgs brightness , as measured by the flux incident on the ao wavefront sensor , was equivalent to a @xmath9  mag star .",
    "the lgs was pointed at the center of the nirc2 field - of - view for all observations .",
    "we obtained images with all or a subset of the broad - band @xmath5  ( 1.02  ) , @xmath10  ( 1.25  ) , @xmath1  ( 1.64  ) , and @xmath11  ( 2.20  ) filters of the mauna kea observatories ( mko ) photometric system @xcite . we also obtained data with the medium - band @xmath12 filter ( central wavelength of 1.592  , 0.126  wide ) , which is positioned around the @xmath1-band peak in the spectra of t  dwarfs .",
    "finally , for wise  j1217 + 1626 , we obtained data with nirc2 s custom `` @xmath13 '' filter ( central wavelength of 1.031  , 0.048  wide ) , which covers the cleanest portion of the @xmath5-band atmospheric window . to avoid confusion with optical filters using the same letter but spanning different wavelengths ,",
    "we refer to this as the @xmath14 filter .    for each filter",
    ", we obtained a set of dithered images , offsetting the telescope by a few arcseconds between every pair of images .",
    "the images were analyzed in the same fashion as our previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the raw images were reduced using standard methods for flat - fielding and sky - subtraction . the binary s flux ratios and relative astrometry",
    "were derived by fitting an analytic model of the point spread function as the sum of three elliptical gaussians .    for the",
    "very well - resolved _ wise _  binaries , we fitted all the individual images and adopted the averages of the results as the final measurements and the standard deviations as the errors .",
    "( the two _ wise _  binaries are so wide that simple aperture photometry gave essentially the same results , as the contamination of the secondary by the primary is negligible . ) for , we fitted the stacked mosaic to maximize the s / n of the faint , close secondary and derived uncertainties from monte carlo simulations , as we did in @xcite . for nirc2 s wide camera , we adopted a pixel scale of @xmath15  mas / pixel and an orientation for the detector s",

    ", we adopted a pixel scale of @xmath18  mas / pixel and an orientation for the detector s",
    "@xmath16  axis of @xmath19@xcite .",
    "the relative astrometry was corrected for ( the very small ) instrumental optical distortion based on a solution by b. cameron ( priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "table  [ table : keck ] presents our final measurements , and figure  [ fig : images ] shows our reduced images .",
    "for all three binaries , the astrometry from the different filters shows excellent agreement .",
    "for wise  j1217 + 1626 , our measurements have  values of 0.89 and 3.46 ( 5 degrees of freedom ) for the separation and pa , respectively , when compared to the hypothesis of a constant value for each quantity . for wise  j1711 + 3500 ,",
    "the  values are 0.2 and 3.10 ( 4 degrees of freedom ) for separation and pa , respectively , and for  they are 2.3 and 0.17 ( 2 degrees of freedom ) . also , our  @xmath10 and @xmath12 flux ratios are consistent with those obtained in 2010 by @xcite , with the new @xmath10-band data being a significant improvement .",
    "given that the uncertainties in the resolved measurements are likely dominated by systematic errors in deblending the two components of this tight binary , we forgo averaging the 2010 and 2012 measurements and simply choose for each filter the measurement with the smaller error in our analysis ( section  3 ) .",
    "we obtained seeing - limited @xmath5-  and @xmath11-band integrated - light photometry of wise  j1217 + 1626ab  using the facility near - ir camera niri @xcite on the gemini - north 8.1-m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "these observations complement the @xmath10- and @xmath1-band photometry published in @xcite .",
    "our niri observations were obtained as queue observing program gn-2012a - dd-2 on 01  april  2012  ut . the seeing was 0.7  fwhm , and the binary was marginally resolved .",
    "we obtained five 60-s exposures at @xmath5-band and eighteen 30-s exposures at @xmath11-band , taken using a dither pattern with 10  offsets .",

    ", we observed the ukirt faint standard fs  21 , using @xmath11-band magnitudes from @xcite and @xmath5-band magnitudes from the ukirt online catalog.cal/fs@xmath20zy@xmath20mko@xmath20wfcam.dat ] we measured @xmath21  mag and @xmath22  mag for the integrated - light system .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , we apply a small shift to transform the niri @xmath5-band photometry to the mko system , giving a final value of @xmath23  mag .",
    "we obtained resolved seeing - limited spectroscopy of wise  j1217 + 1626ab  with the facilty near - ir spectrograph nirspec @xcite on the keck - ii telescope on 12  april  2012  ut . seeing conditions were excellent , with 0.50.7  fwhm in the optical as measured from the dimm at the nearby canada - france - hawaii telescope , suitable to resolve the two components of the binary .",
    "very light cirrus was present in the sky .",
    "we used the low spectral resolution mode with the 0.38  @xmath24  42  slit and the nirspec-5 blocking filter , which spans the @xmath1-band . the achieved spectral resolution ( @xmath25 ) was @xmath26 based on measurements of bright isolated sky emission lines .",
    "the slit was oriented along the binary pa which did not match the parallactic angle . however ,",
    "the binary was observed at airmass 1.01.1 so systematic errors due to differential chromatic refraction were negligible .",
    "we obtained 12  exposures of wise  j1217 + 1626ab , each with a  300  s integration time , nodding the telescope in an abba fashion .",
    "immediately afterwards , we observed the a0v star hd  109055 for telluric calibration and then obtained calibration observations of an internal flat - field source , argon arc lamps , and a dark frame . during the spectroscopic observations of both the science target and a0v calibrator ,",
    "the nirspec image quality was afflicted by an unusual guiding program , causing the formation of double - peaked psfs in the spatial direction on the detector .",
    "the psf s secondary peak was typically about 2/3 the flux of the main peak and in the direction opposite the binary s b  component .",
    "basic image reduction was performed with the redspec reduction package .",
    "this included bad pixel removal , spatial rectification of the images , the creation of a wavelength solution , pairwise image subtraction , and flat fielding .",
    "residual sky line emission in the pair - subtracted images was removed by subtracting a constant value at each wavelength as measured from a spatial region 10 pixels in width on either side of the target spectrum .    because of the close separation of the binary pair and the unusual double - peaked psf , we extracted 1-d spectra from the 2-d rectified images using custom idl routines . we found that modeling the psf as the sum of two gaussians provided an excellent match to the data .",
    "the 2-gaussian psf of the two binary components differed only in total flux and position , as we fixed the fwhm and the relative amplitude of the 2  gaussians to be the same for each binary component . to determine the psf characteristics of each image",
    ", we fit this 2-gaussian psf model to the collapsed 1.55 - 1.60  spatial profile of the individual reduced images using the nonlinear , least - squares curve fitting package mpfit written in idl @xcite .",
    "the fitting results were used to fix all parameters of the psf except the flux ratio of the binary .",
    "this model was then fit to the spatial profile as a function of wavelength , while median - averaging the spectrum in wavelength bins to boost the s / n .",
    "we found this model to be an excellent fit to the data , as the subtraction of a 2-d image based on the model fits from the original data produced essentially a pure noise image , without any coherent residuals .",
    "the resulting individual spectra for wise  j1217 + 1626  a and  b were computed at each wavelength bin by summing the flux of their respective 2-gaussian psfs . to construct the final spectra ,",
    "we combined the individual extracted spectra by first scaling each one to the median - averaged spectrum from 1.551.65  .",
    "then at each wavelength we computed the weighted average , with the weights inversely proportional to the fwhm of the psf model .",
    "the purpose of the weighting is to favor data obtained in better seeing conditions .",
    "we adopted the standard error of the individual spectra as the measurement uncertainties for the final spectrum .",
    "the spectra of the a0v calibrator star were extracted by summing flux in a single fixed - sized aperture and then combined .",
    "this was used to correct the spectra of wise  j1217 + 1626a  and  b for telluric absorption using the xtellcor_general routine in the spextool reduction package for irtf @xcite . to test the sensitivity of the results to the fitting procedure , we experimented with wavelength bin sizes of 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 pixels ( 0.0014 , 0.0028 , 0.0042 , 0.0055  ) .",
    "we also extracted the spectra by allowing the fwhm of each gaussian in the 2-gaussian psf model vary .",
    "the results were all consistent within the spectral measurement uncertainties .",
    "we use the 10-pixel binned data for our final analysis , as the resulting sampling gives a resolution ( @xmath27 ) compared to other published near - ir spectra of late - t and y  dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the reduced spectra of the two components .",
    "the peak s / n are about 60 and 15 for the primary and secondary , respectively . as a cross - check on our reduction",
    ", we also compare the sum of our spectra with the integrated - light spectrum from @xcite and find excellent agreement , as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we also compute an @xmath1-band flux ratio from our nirspec spectra of @xmath28  mag , in accord with our keck lgs imaging ( @xmath29  mag ) .",
    "to improve upon the modest s / n data for wise  j1711 + 3500  presented in @xcite , we obtained near - ir photometry and low - resolution ( @xmath30 ) spectroscopy of wise  j1711 + 3500 .",
    "such data are important for our analysis , since the keck lgs imaging provides only flux ratios for the two components .",
    "computing the resolved magnitudes requires multi - band integrated - light photometry , which can be synthesized from a near - ir spectrum and photometry in a single band .",
    "we used the facilty instrument spex @xcite at nasa s infrared telescope facility located on mauna kea , hawaii on 2012  april  20  ut .",
    "for imaging , we obtained 9  dithered exposures of wise  j1711 + 3500  and the ukirt faint standard fs  27 using the mko @xmath10-band filter .",
    "conditions were photometric with good seeing , 0.60.7fwhm in @xmath10-band as measured from the reduced images .",
    "data were reduced in a standard fashion , and we used aperture photometry to determine an apparent magnitude of @xmath31  mag , with the uncertainty determined from the quadrature sum of the standard error of the fluxes from the individual images of the science target and photometric calibrator .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath32  mag , which is consistent with our measurement given the @xmath00.3  mag offset expected for late - t dwarfs between the mko and 2mass filter systems @xcite .",
    "our near - ir spectrum ( described below ) finds @xmath33  mag , consistent with the @xmath34  mag difference between our photometry and that of kirkpatrick et al .    for spectroscopy , we used spex in prism mode with the 0.8  slit , obtaining 0.82.5  spectra in a single order .",
    "wise  j1711 + 3500  was nodded along the slit in an abba pattern with individual exposure times of 180  sec for a total exposure time of 48  min and observed over an airmass range of 1.041.06 .",
    "we observed the a0v star gat  7 @xcite contemporaneously for telluric calibration .",
    "all spectra were reduced using version  3.4 of the spextool software package @xcite .",
    "the s / n per pixel in the final reduced spectrum is about 35 , 50 , 25 , and 8 in the @xmath35 peaks , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra1711 ] shows that our spectrum agrees well with that of @xcite .",
    "we use our spectrum and @xmath10-band photometry to synthesize the integrated - light magnitudes in the @xmath36  bands on the mko system ( table  [ table : wisetwo ] ) .",
    "with only one epoch of imaging , it is not possible to determine if the companions seen in the keck lgs images are co - moving with the our two _ wise _  targets . but the resolved photometry of the systems ( and spectra in the case of wise  j1217 + 1626ab ) provides overwhelming circumstantial evidence that the binaries are true physical associations .",
    "specifically , the nearly identical flux ratios in the @xmath37 and @xmath1-band images indicates that the secondary components also have strong methane absorption , with basically no flux redward of the 1.6  flux decrement seen in t  dwarfs .",
    "the possibility of two unassociated t  dwarfs having such a small angular separation is diminishingly small .",
    "@xcite identified 54  t dwarfs in an area of 700  degs@xmath38 to a depth of @xmath39  mag .",
    "nine of these objects are spectral type t7 or later , where the @xmath1-band methane absorption is saturated in medium - band filter photometry ( figure  4 of @xcite ) . assuming a uniform space density of late - t  dwarfs , this means a surface density of 0.20  late - t  dwarfs per  degs  to a depth of @xmath40  mag . within the field of view of the nirc2 wide and narrow cameras",
    ", this corresponds to probabilities of @xmath41 and @xmath42 for an unassociated t  dwarf to be next to wise  j1217 + 1626  and wise  j1711 + 3500 , respectively .",
    "this is highly unlikely .",
    "note that this calculation is an _ a posteriori _ one based on a discovery of a companion to a individual target .",
    "we need to consider the total number of objects that we have imaged with sensitivity to late - t dwarf companions . our keck lgs program to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has targeted about 100  field t  dwarfs using the nirc2 narrow camera .",
    "thus the probability of an unassociated late - t companion being contiguous to any single object in our survey is @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "however , note that both these `` single - object '' and `` total - survey '' calculations overstate the odds of a chance association , since they do not consider that the photometric distance of a background late - t dwarf would not be compatible with those of the science targets . we conclude that both _ wise",
    "_  systems are physical binaries .",
    "we searched for common proper motion companions within 10@xmath44 of wise  j1217 + 1626 , using the proper motion reported in kirkpatrick et al .",
    "we found no comoving objects in the hipparcos , tycho , lspm - n , or nltt catalogs .",
    "the reported proper motion of wise  j1711 + 3500  is consistent with zero , obviating a search for comoving companions .",
    "we can estimate photometric distances to our two binaries using the late - t primary components , and then as a result we also know the distances to the t / y secondary components . to compute a photometric distance for wise  j1217 + 1626ab , we compare the apparent magnitudes of component  a to the six t8.5 and t9  dwarfs with parallaxes summarized in @xcite and using the @xcite spectral types for the latest t  dwarfs .",
    "we include the t8.5  dwarfs ( 1 )  to compensate for the small sample of only two t9  dwarfs with parallaxes and mko near - ir photometry ( ugps  j0722@xmath40540 and cfbdsir  j1458 + 1013a , which differ from each other by @xmath00.9  mag in absolute magnitudes ) and ( 2 )  to encompass the current uncertainties in the spectral typing of the very coolest brown dwarfs . a weighted average of the absolute magnitudes gives @xmath45  mag , where the uncertainty here is the rms scatter of the six objects .",
    "we use the @xmath10- and @xmath1-band data for the photometric distance , as the @xmath5  and @xmath11  bands are more influenced by variations in metallicity and surface gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both bands give an identical distance modulus of @xmath46  mag ( @xmath47  pc ) for wise  j1217 + 1626a .    in a similar fashion , for wise  j1711 + 3500ab",
    "we use the @xcite weighted average of @xmath10- and @xmath1-band absolute magnitudes for t8  dwarfs , choosing the three objects that are `` normal '' ( not young or low metallicity ) .",
    "these give distance moduli of @xmath48 and @xmath49  mag , respectively .",
    "we take the average and adopt the slightly larger rms for a final distance modulus of @xmath50  mag ( @xmath51  pc ) for wise  j1711 + 3500a .",
    "as expected , our photometric distances are larger than the 6.7  pc and 17.0  pc estimates for wise  j1217 + 1626  and wise  j1711 + 3500 , respectively , given by @xcite which were based on integrated - light @xmath52-band photometry assuming a single object .",
    "note that if the large flux ratios we observe in the near - ir ( @xmath023  mag ) were also representative of the mid - ir flux ratios , we would expect better agreement between our distances and those of kirkpatrick et al .",
    "in other words , the secondary components in these systems must be relatively brighter in the mid - ir and thus contribute a larger portion of the @xmath52-band flux , as expected based on the very red mid - ir colors of the coolest brown dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "our nirspec spectra of both components of wise  j1217 + 1626ab  exhibit the deep  and  absorption in the @xmath1-band that is characteristic of the coolest brown dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : typing ] compares our @xmath1-band spectra with the t9 and y0 spectroscopic standards proposed by @xcite .",
    "component  a shows excellent agreement with their t9 standard .",
    "the spectral type for this component is identical to the integrated - light type , as expected given the large near - ir flux ratios .",
    "component  b shows good match with the y0  standard wise  j1738 + 2732 .",
    "in particular , the hallmark of the y  spectral type proposed by @xcite is the enhanced absorption at 1.531.58  seen in the low - resolution spectra of the coolest _ wise _  discoveries that is distinct from the latest t  dwarfs .",
    "they attribute this feature to , though a definitive identification is still pending .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : typing ] , wise  j1217 + 1626b  shows the same enhancd absorption on the blue side as the y0  standard , and thus we classify it as y0 .",
    "the red side of the @xmath1-band continuum for wise  j1217 + 1626b  does not appear to be as sharply truncated as for the y0  standard .",
    "however , the other y0  dwarf from the @xcite with reasonable s / n , wise  j1405 + 5534 , also has a similar redward extent , which motivated a classification of `` y0  ( pec ? ) '' in their discovery paper . given the modest s / n of our spectrum , we defer a decision on whether wise  j1217 + 1626b  is spectroscopically peculiar .",
    "followup resolved spectroscopy with broader wavelength coverage will help refine the spectral typing , especially as the width of the @xmath10-band continuum appears to decrease with later - type objects .      in the absence of resolved spectroscopy for wise  j1711 + 3500ab",
    ", we consider the flux ratios and estimated absolute magnitudes of the components to estimate their spectral types .",
    "the large near - ir flux ratios ( @xmath02.8  mag ) suggests strongly that the t8 integrated - light spectrum is dominated by the primary .",
    "this is corroborated with simple numerical experiments combining spectra of late - t and y0  dwarfs using the observed @xmath1-band flux ratio as a constraint .",
    "the @xmath5310@xmath24 fainter secondary has negligible impact on the near - ir spectrum .",
    "thus we safely classify wise  j1711 + 3500a  as t8 .    for the secondary ,",
    "we use its near - ir absolute magnitude as estimated from the photometric distance to the primary .",
    "this is obviously an uncertain process , though preliminary parallaxes from @xcite suggest that the near - ir absolute magnitudes drop off quickly at the t / y transition , which lessens the impact of uncertainties in the photometric distance .",
    "wise  j1711 + 3500b  has @xmath54  mag , which is intermediate between the two t9 and two y0  dwarfs with parallaxes in figure  12 of @xcite .",
    "( their figure has  plotted as the sole t9.5 , but as discussed in the next subsection this object is more likely to be typed as y0 . ) in terms of its @xmath3 color and estimated color - magnitude diagram position , wise  j1711 + 3500b  also appears to be intermediate between the t9 and y0 dwarfs ( section  [ sec : phot ] ) .",
    "thus we estimate a spectral type of t9.5 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    at the time  was discovered to be a binary , the near - ir absolute magnitudes of its secondary component were fainter than the coolest known dwarf ,  which was classified as t10 at the time @xcite .",
    "this motivated an initial spectral type estimate of @xmath53t10 for the secondary by @xcite , with the primary type assumed to be identical to the integrated - light type of t9.5 .",
    "while the secondary type was unknown given the absence of resolved spectroscopy , the monotonic behavior of near - ir absolute magnitudes among the t  dwarfs demonstrated the object was exceptionally low temperature .",
    "since then , there have been several late - t and y  dwarfs identified from the _ wise _  dataset , which has warranted a reclassification of the integrated - light spectrum to t9 by @xcite . given this new state of knowledge , we reexamine here the resolved spectral types ..    based on the latest @xmath1-band absolute magnitudes from @xcite , @xcite estimated types of t8.5 and t9.5 for the two components of .",
    "however , closer examination of the data indicates these types are too early .",
    "as is the case with wise  j1711 + 3500a , the large near - ir flux ratios ( @xmath02  mag ) of  indicate the t9 integrated - light spectrum is dominated by the primary .",
    "this is corroborated by the aforementioned experiments of summing spectra and by the model atmosphere fitting in @xcite , which found a blended - light spectrum had negligible impact on the derived physical parameters .",
    "as for the secondary , it has @xmath55 mag , in good agreement with the two y0  dwarfs in @xcite with parallaxes .",
    "this absolute magnitude also agrees well with that estimated for the ( spectroscopically typed ) y0 dwarf wise  j1217 + 1626b , based on our photometric distance for wise  j1217 + 1626a .",
    "thus we estimate the near - ir spectral types for the two components of  are t9 and y0 .",

    "based on the photometric distance to its primary , the location of wise  j1217 + 1626b  on the color - magnitude diagram also suggests a temperture low enough for potassium depletion .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , current cloud - free models agree reasonably well in @xmath79 .",

    "the fact that these two systems are so unusual in their separation and mass ratios compared to nearly all previously known substellar binaries opens the question of whether these initial discoveries among the late - t dwarfs is a harbinger of a change in binary properties at such cool temperatures .",
    "an answer awaits a larger survey of such targets at comparable sensitivity .",

    "examining the complete ensemble of available @xmath3 color data , we find a sharp drop to the blue between the t9.5  and y0  dwarfs .",
    "we suggest this may be the signature of potassium depletion , which removes a significant opacity source at far - red optical wavelengths and is expected for objects of @xmath2400  k. it is a fortuitous coincidence that the change in near - ir spectra that demarcates the t / y transition ( currently suspected to be due to ) also coincides with this change in photospheric chemistry . however , in contrast to the relatively subtle changes in the near - ir spectra between t9 and y0 , the @xmath3 color drops by @xmath00.5  mag .",

    "it is unclear whether such dispersion represents intrinsic variations in the physical properties of y  dwarfs , failings in the model atmospheres , or both . for binaries ,",
    "the two components have a common ( albeit unknown ) metallicity and very similar surface gravity ( tables  [ table : wiseone ] and  [ table : wisetwo ] ) . thus resolved spectra will cleanly probe the effect of decreasing temperature , without the uncertainties arising from second parameter variations ( age / gravity or metallicity ) present in the free - floating population . in a similar vein , spectrophotometric monitoring of the two components may shed light on the nature of the clouds at the t / y transition .    finally , the photometric distances of 1020  pc place wise  j1217 + 1626ab  and wise  j1711 + 3500ab  easily within reach of near - ir parallax measurements , and we have begun such monitoring using the canada - france - hawaii telescope @xcite . a direct distance will place the four components in context with other late - t and y  dwarfs , through both the absolute magnitude - spectral type relation and color - magnitude diagrams . given the unusually small mass ratios of @xmath00.5 for these systems ,",

    "the differences are especially significant for the late - t and y  dwarfs as the peak of their continuum in this bandpass falls near the red edge of the filter , so for a given object the @xmath5-band magnitudes will be brightest for the ukirt / wfcam filter and faintest for the keck / nirc2 filter . to assess the offsets between filters , we synthesize colors in the various @xmath5-band filters using spectra of t8y0 dwarfs with sufficient blue wavelength coverage , primarily from @xcite and @xcite .",

    "note that applying this shift does not affect one of our main results , namely the very blue @xmath78 color of wise  j1217 + 1626b  compared to previously known objects , since the secondary is unusually blue relative to both the field objects and its t9 primary even if we apply no shift at all .",
    "we also compute a keck - ukirt shift of @xmath83  mag .",
    "figure  [ fig : yband ] indicates that for y0  dwarfs , the wfcam flux should be systematically different than for the keck or gemini fluxes given the stronger water absorption cutoff in the red edge of the bandpass for later - type objects , but no convincing offset was detected between the two y dwarfs ( wise  j0410 + 1502 and wise  j1541@xmath42250 ) and the t8t9.5  dwarfs in our compilation , especially given the low s / n spectra of the latest - type objects .",
