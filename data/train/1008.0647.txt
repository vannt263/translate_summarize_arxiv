    "circinus  x-1 is an unusual x - ray binary ( xrb ) . @xcite",
    "first noticed that circinus  x-1 resides inside of a parsec - scale radio nebula inflated by curved jets .",
    "more - recent radio observations have observed jet emission on multiple scales ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "additionally , at the peak of the 40 + year x - ray light curve ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite detected evidence of superluminal motion from ultra - relativistic jets within a few arcseconds of the xrb , which would make this the only known accreting neutron star with an ultra - relativistic jet . with",
    "its resolved , parsec - scale radio jets , circinus  x-1 has become an important stepping stone in our understanding of microquasars over the past few decades .",
    "circinus  x-1 has been extensively studied at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "type - i x - ray bursts , originally observed by @xcite and seen again by @xcite during a recent flare , now firmly establish that the compact object is an accreting neutron star .",
    "gratings observations of the point source have revealed variable x - ray p - cygni line profiles that were interpreted as high - velocity outflows ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have claimed possible detection of a highly - inclined precessing jet ( similar to ss433 , e.g. , @xcite ) through doppler - shifted x - ray line emission .",
    "however , this interpretation is not unique as the emission is also consistent with simple orbital motion of the neutron star .",
    "moreover , @xcite also analyzed that particular data set and , with systematic uncertainties included , find no shifts .",
    "finally , in the longest gratings observation of the point source ( zero - order , 50  ks ) taken in 2005 , @xcite discovered faint , diffuse x - ray emission roughly coincident with the arcminute - scale radio jets . however , the observation had insufficient signal  to  noise to constrain the nature of the emission spectroscopically .",
    "similar diffuse emission was subsequently seen in a 50  ks hrc - i observation @xcite , but no spectral information was available with this instrument .    in this letter , we report on a follow - up deep _",
    "imaging observation of the diffuse x - ray emission found by @xcite .",
    "we outline our observations in section 2 and present an initial analysis of the emission in section 3 .",
    "section 4 discusses the physical implications .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 5 . throughout this letter , we assume a distance of 7.8  kpc @xcite , which is in the middle of a wide range of distance estimates ( 4.111.8 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "we observed circinus  x-1 on the s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) aboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ on 2009 may 1 , in a continuous 99  ks exposure .",
    "data were taken in timed exposure mode and telemetered in faint mode .",
    "data reduction and analysis were completed using ciao and sherpa versions 4.2 , xspec 12.5.1 , and acis extract version 2010 - 02 - 26 ( ae ; @xcite ) .",
    "compared to previous gratings and hrc - i observations , this observation proved about an order of magnitude more sensitive to diffuse flux not only because of the long exposure and the lack of gratings , but also because the contaminating emission from the point source was at an exceptionally low level ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "radio comparison data were constructed from two separate observations .",
    "standard calibrations using the miriad software @xcite were applied to both sets of observations .",
    "a low angular resolution radio image was derived from data taken on 2001 august 3 during an 11 hr run at 1.4 ghz with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in 1.5a array configuration .",
    "this observation and the resulting images were presented in @xcite and are shown as contours in figure  [ fig : outer_radio_overlay ] .    a higher angular resolution radio image ( figure   [ fig : inner_radio_overlay ] ) was created from @xmath2 hr of observations spread from 2009 december 30 to 2010 january 8 , using the atca - compact array broadband backend in 6a configuration at 5.5 ghz ( d. e. calvelo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the reduced event file of the x - ray observation is shown in figure  [ fig : outer_radio_overlay ] with a contour overlay of the low - resolution radio image of the large - scale radio nebula of circinus  x-1 .",
    "this image clearly shows the existence of two bright emission regions @xmath3 from the point source .    in order to highlight the morphology of the diffuse emission closer to the point source and to allow detailed comparison with the high - resolution radio image",
    ", we created an exposure - corrected , background - subtracted image ( figure  [ fig : inner_radio_overlay ] ) .",
    "background surface brightness profiles were constructed by azimuthally averaging over nested partial annuli in the ne and sw quadrants ( visually chosen to exclude the excess diffuse emission ) and then subtracted from the exposure - corrected image .",
    "finally , we note that on the largest scales , we find roughly axisymmetric soft emission from what we interpret as the dust - scattering halo , centered on the binary , best visible in the adaptively - smoothed image in figure  [ fig : csmooth ] .",
    "an in - depth discussion of the dust - scattering halo will be presented in a follow - up paper .",
    "image analysis and x - ray ",
    "radio comparisons are presented below , ordered from smaller to larger scales . all well - determined background / foreground point sources were masked and excluded from our analysis .",
    "we caught circinus  x-1 at the lowest observed flux to date ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "even so , the source is still significantly piled up with a pileup fraction of @xmath5 .",
    "we will present detailed model fits to the point source spectrum in a follow  up paper .      because the point source was so faint",
    ", the point spread function ( psf ) from the xrb only dominates the inner @xmath6 .",
    "this enabled us to search for jet emission on scales of a fraction of a parsec , much smaller than what had been possible in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found two sources within @xmath7 of the point source , which are both evident in figure  [ fig : inner_radio_overlay ] :    * in the w - nw direction ( between position angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 , measured counterclockwise from due w ) , we find a clear surface brightness enhancement separated from the xrb by @xmath6 and extending out to @xmath10 .",
    "the emission appears to be _ resolved _ and is coincident with a source in the high - resolution radio image .",
    "no ir counterpart is found in either 24 @xmath11 m mipsgal or 3.68@xmath11 m glimpse _ spitzer _ images .",
    "given that the source is extended and aligned with the large - scale radio jet and with the x - ray caps reported below , we interpret this source as genuine jet emission .",
    "* in the se direction ( at position angle @xmath12 ) , we detect a bright , _ unresolved _ point source at @xmath13 from the xrb .",
    "this emission is coincident with a point - like radio source .",
    "it is spatially coincident with a very bright ir point source , with no optical counterpart detected in an archival 5 minute hst / wfpc i exposure .",
    "+ from the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ) log _ n_log",
    "_ s _ , we estimate that the probability of finding a background radio point source of the same or larger flux within 13 arcseconds from circinus  x-1 is @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , given the ir source density in the region , the likelihood of finding an ir background source with equal or larger flux coincident with the radio and x - ray point source within the mips psf is also of order 1% .",
    "neither scenario can be ruled out statistically .",
    "thus , we can not draw any conclusions about the nature of the se point source without further observational evidence , e.g. , from optical spectroscopy , variability , or proper motion .",
    "a detailed psf subtraction of the binary emission ( complicated by effects of pileup ) and spectral fits of these sources are beyond the scope of this letter and will be presented in a follow - up paper .      the most obvious features in figures  [ fig : outer_radio_overlay]-[fig : csmooth ] are the two diffuse emission regions between @xmath15 and @xmath16 from circinus x-1 in the nw and se directions .",
    "the positions of both regions are consistent with the diffuse emission tentatively reported in @xcite and @xcite . based on their morphological appearance ( nw cap appears slightly concave ) and their placement away from the binary along the jet axis",
    ", we will refer to both regions as `` caps '' throughout the rest of this letter .",
    "however , the geometry of these regions could be complicated by projection effects , and other interpretations are possible .",
    "the caps have distinctly different x - ray colors from both the much redder large - scale diffuse background ( dominated by the dust - scattering halo ) and the distinctly bluer psf , as can be seen from the color image in figure  [ fig : csmooth ] .",
    "the two caps have very similar surface brightnesses ( @xmath17 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 ) and appear to be similar in their angular extent ( nw : @xmath21@xmath22 ; se : @xmath23245@xmath24 ) .",
    "however , they are asymmetric in their radial extent ( nw : @xmath2550@xmath26 , se : @xmath271845@xmath26 ) . the inner nw jet emission ( section  3.2 ) has similar position and opening angles to the nw cap .    the correspondence between the high - resolution radio contours ( @xmath28 ) and the x - ray cap emission in figure  [ fig : inner_radio_overlay ] is striking .",
    "while the x - ray image has significantly higher angular resolution than the radio , it is clear that the x - ray caps align closely with the extended jet emission .",
    "the diffuse emission to the se of the xrb in the radio image shows a sharp surface brightness drop at the position of the cap and what has been interpreted as a bend in the jet direction at this position , trailing to the south ( referred to as `` knot b '' in @xcite ) .",
    "we see no clear corresponding surface brightness enhancement to this trail in the x - rays .",
    "however , our sensitivity is compromised by the fact that the read streak runs right along this feature .",
    "we used partial annuli regions to extract the cap spectra .",
    "because the background is dominated by the dust - scattering halo , the surface brightness of which depends on the angular distance to circinus x-1 , we carefully selected background partial annuli at the same radial extent as the source regions . we recover a total of 6240 source counts over 2860 expected background counts in both cap regions combined ( 0.59.5 kev ) .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "initial extractions of each of the caps indicated that the spectral parameters are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "therefore , we jointly fit the spectra .",
    "we restricted our spectral analysis to 0.59.5  kev .",
    "quoted uncertainties correspond to 90% confidence intervals .",
    "the spectra are well fit by an absorbed powerlaw with a neutral hydrogen column of @xmath29 and a photon index , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 over 252 degrees of freedom ) , giving 0.59.5 kev cap fluxes of @xmath32 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 ( nw ) and @xmath33 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 ( se ) .    the caps can also be fit by a thermal ( apec ) model ( @xmath34 over 251 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the required absorbing column is very similar to the power - law case with @xmath35 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there is no obvious line emission present in the spectra , the apec fit requires a low abundance of @xmath36 and a high temperature of @xmath37 kev .",
    "when forced to solar abundance , the fit requires even higher temperatures .",
    "the 0.59.5 kev cap fluxes are @xmath32 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 ( nw ) and @xmath38 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 ( se ) .",
    "the limb - brightened morphology of the x - ray image ( which has significantly higher angular resolution than either radio image ) suggests that the emission from the two caps originates at a shock in the outflow from circinus x-1 , seen in projection .",
    "this suggestion is supported by a sharp drop in surface brightness in radio and x - ray just outside of the caps and by the fact that the se radio jet seems to be changing direction at the location of the x - ray cap .",
    "the fact that the caps appear inside the large - scale radio nebula would be a result of foreshortening , since the jet axis is likely inclined with respect to the line of sight ( though the actual inclination is unknown ) .",
    "the outflow itself appears largely x - ray dark ( except for the inner nw diffuse radio  x - ray feature ) , similar to the x - ray cavities observed in many clusters with central radio galaxies .",
    "the caps span projected half  opening angles of @xmath39 ( nw ) and @xmath40 ( se ) .",
    "this implies that either :    * the outflow is , in fact , much wider than what would typically be considered a jet and might thus be better characterized as a non - thermal wind , or * the jets are precessing with a fairly wide opening angle , as is the case for ss433 ( @xcite ) , and/or * the jet or precession cone axis is very close to the line of sight , causing significant foreshortening of an intrinsically narrow jet .",
    "the wide opening angle of the _ inner _ nw jet would be consistent with ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , but to be consistent with ( 2 ) , it would require a precession period of the jet that is short compared to the travel time through the x - ray emission region to blend the jet emission ( as seen in the arcsecond radio jets of ss433 * ? ? ?",
    "the claim of a highly relativistic jet ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) coupled with these new observations would require that such a jet has a precession cone that is within @xmath43 of the line  of  sight such that the jet sometimes points very close to the line  of  sight .",
    "such a geometry would imply a physical scale of @xmath44  pc from cap to cap . for comparison , this is an order of magnitude larger than the projected distance between the hotspots of xte  j1550564 @xcite and h1743322 @xcite but would still fit comfortably within the radio nebula surrounding ss433 @xcite .",
    "below , we will discuss two possible interpretations of the radiative origin of the cap emission .",
    "the most likely interpretation of the spectra is synchrotron emission . in this case",
    ", the emission arises from the reaccelerated jet particles entering the terminal shock , as is observed in the hot spots of many fr  ii radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emission in this case should be co - spatial with the radio , which appears consistent with the radio contours in figure  [ fig : inner_radio_overlay ] .",
    "the radio synchrotron spectrum of the large - scale nebula has a typical spectral index of @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 @xcite , consistent with the standard power - law slope of first - order fermi acceleration . for the canonical model of continuously injected power - law electrons one would expect a spectral index of @xmath47 above the cooling break at frequency @xmath48 , perfectly consistent with the observed x - ray spectral index of @xmath49 . from extrapolation of the radio and x - ray spectra",
    ", we estimate the break frequency from uncooled to cooled synchrotron emission to be @xmath50 hz , which is uncertain by about an order of magnitude when uncertainties in the radio and x - ray spectral indices are used primarily because the x - ray and radio power - law slopes are extrapolated over a very large range of frequencies .    taking the emission regions to be spherical to lowest order",
    ", we estimate the equipartition magnetic field strength to be @xmath51 g , which gives a _ minimum _ total internal energy for each emission region of @xmath52 erg . from the estimate of the break frequency",
    ", we estimate a cooling time , @xmath53 .",
    "a different emission geometry will change these numbers by factors of order unity .",
    "together , these numbers provide a robust _ lower _ limit on the total jet power of @xmath54 , needed _",
    "just _ to put the synchrotron emitting particles in place ( not including any plasma currently in the jet or the energy needed to inflate the large - scale radio nebula ) . departing from equipartition can only _",
    "increase _ this number .",
    "this limit is _ independent _ of the assumed geometry and size of the emission regions .",
    "conversely , we can place a rough _ upper _ limit on the outflow power from the fact that the large - scale radio nebula must be at least as old as @xmath55 . using the same arguments as presented in @xcite and @xcite for the expansion of the radio nebula we find that @xmath56 , though this limit is not as robust since the magnetic field could well be out of equipartition and the nebula could be significantly elongated along the line  of  sight",
    ", both of which would increase the total power .    these limits on @xmath57",
    "confirm that the accreting compact object in this system is driving powerful jets into the interstellar medium ( ism ) . taking the high 42 year average luminosity of circinus  x-1 at about 80% of the eddington luminosity for a 1.4 @xmath58 neutron star @xcite at face value would imply that the long - term average jet power is between 2% and 10% of the _ current _ average radiative power .",
    "given that the average long - term accretion rate can not greatly exceed the eddington rate , we can derive a robust lower limit on the efficiency with which accretion power is converted into outflow power of @xmath59 ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "given the equally good fit we achieved with a thermal emission model , it is worth discussing the alternative scenario that the x - ray caps are the shocked ism pushed ahead of the expanding radio outflow ( similar to the shells around many x - ray cavities in galaxy clusters and around the microquasar cygnus  x-1 ; @xcite ) .    in the thermal model the x",
    "- rays should be located further out from the binary than the radio emission . however ,",
    "the high - resolution radio data indicate that the radio and the x - ray emission are co - spatial .",
    "this requires a very low inclination angle in order to align the two regions by projection ( which is consistent with the inclination required by the ultra - relativistic flow claimed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from the best - fit temperature of 6.6 kev",
    ", we directly infer a shock velocity of @xmath60 km s@xmath19 . from the projected distance",
    ", we can infer an estimated travel time of @xmath61 years out to the observed shock positions for each of the caps . again approximating the emission region as spherical",
    ", we estimate the mass and the total ( thermal plus kinetic ) energy of the shocked material for each of the caps to be @xmath62 g and @xmath63 erg , respectively .",
    "combined with the shock travel age , this gives a minimum outflow power for both caps combined of @xmath64 erg@xmath19 s@xmath19 , _ just _ to supply the x - ray emitting material ( not including the putative power required to inflate the large - scale radio nebula ) . unless the inclination angle is very small , this power is exceedingly large . even for inclinations as low as those inferred from the relativistic jet claimed in @xcite , the _ minimum",
    "_ average power would still be @xmath65 .    while we can not completely rule out a thermal origin , the very high power required by the thermal model combined with the perfect spectral correspondence to a classic broken synchrotron spectrum and the spatial correspondence with the radio suggest that the synchrotron model is the more natural choice .",
    "we have presented an initial analysis of a deep _ chandra _ imaging observation of circinus x-1 . we detect two diffuse x - ray caps that are likely the terminal shocks of powerful jets running into the ism .",
    "in addition , we find an arcsecond - scale outflow between the xrb and one of the x - ray caps , coincident with the radio jet .",
    "these discoveries make circinus  x-1 the first microquasar with both an x - ray jet and two stationary x - ray shocks , and one of only a handful of microquasars with a direct estimate of the jet power ."
