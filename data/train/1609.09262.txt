    "semiconductor surfaces are of enormous importance both industrially , as the basis of the microelectronics industry , and scientifically , where they form the basis for studies of diffusion , growth and electronic structure .",
    "moreover , recently a number of proposals for quantum information implementations based on isolated states in or near semiconductor surfaces have emerged @xcite . in light of this , it is vital that our understanding of their atomic and electronic structure is as accurate and detailed as possible .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that both the gap and the character of the valence band depend strongly on the thickness of slabs used to model the system , and find that the slabs used in most calculations are much too small to describe the electronic structure of si(100 ) , the most common surface in industry .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) has become the standard approach to model the atomic and electronic structures of semiconductor surfaces . although it is known to underestimate the band gap of solids , dft generally reproduces the density of states ( dos ) and band structure accurately . a surface is usually modeled by using a supercell consisting of a slab with two surfaces and a vacuum region .",
    "since this approach gives a non - periodic system perpendicular to the surface ( z direction ) , the accuracy of the resulting electronic structure will depend on the slab thickness . in case of the ge(100 ) surface , which bears a very similar structure to si(100 )",
    ", the influence of slab thickness on the top of the valence band has been discussed in detail @xcite . some other physical properties , such as surface electronic structure @xcite",
    ", dielectric function @xcite , chemical reactivity @xcite , and transport properties @xcite , sensitively vary with cell size and slab thickness .",
    "since recent improvements to experimental techniques allow measurements to be made with high energy resolution ( @xmath1 mev ) , slab thickness is likely to become a key parameter in determining energy precision in dft modeling .",
    "however , it is still unclear how thick a slab is needed to reliably produce the electronic structure of a semiconductor surface ; one study @xcite suggested that slab thickness was unimportant , while another study of the basic @xmath2 reconstruction @xcite suggested , without giving detailed analysis , that at least 30 layers are required .",
    "recently , we found that previously reported band structures of si(100 ) calculated with dft @xcite do not compare well with data obtained by the state - of - the - art angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscope ( arpes ) @xcite . in addressing this problem",
    ", we found that surprisingly thick slabs were required to obtain agreement with the arpes data . in this paper , we report the critical slab thicknesses in the dft calculation required to reliably produce the electronic structure of the si(100 ) surface in terms of dos and band structure .",

    "the si(100)-_p_(2@xmath02 ) surface was modeled using supercells consisting of a si slab and vacuum layer of approximately 15   thick ( this vacuum thickness was carefully converged ) .",
