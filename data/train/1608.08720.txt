    "out - of - equilibrium phenomena are as prevalent in natural and engineered systems as equilibrium ones . despite this , our understanding of nonequilibrium states of matter is far inferior to the understanding of equilibrium states governed by the broadly applicable foundational principles of statistical mechanics . at the fundamental level , our ability to describe and characterise out - of - equilibrium phenomena requires understanding of the organising principles of nonequilibrium quantum states from the underlying microscopic interactions between the constituent particles . such understanding , however , is hampered by the fact that real - time dynamics of interacting many - particle systems is an unsolved problem in many - body physics , except for special cases amenable to pure numerical simulations . even for systems that can be described by a handful of known exactly solvable models of many - body theory , the calculation of physical observables",
    "is often limited to only the ground - state or finite - temperature _ equilibrium _ states .",
    "describing the _ out - of - equilibrium _ behaviour of such systems , on the other hand , is extremely challenging , especially in experimentally realistic finite - temperature scenarios .    in recent years",
    ", ultracold quantum gases have emerged as a platform - of - choice for studying nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that such gases represent nearly - ideal and highly controllable realisations of various models of many - body theory in which nonequilibrium behaviour can be accessed on observable time scales . a particularly active research area here concerned the study of quantum quenches and mechanisms of relaxation in 1d bose gases @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) , which , in the uniform limit , can be well approximated by the integrable lieb - liniger model @xcite with delta - function pairwise interactions between the particles .",
    "the limit of infinitely strong repulsive interactions in the lieb - liniger model corresponds to a 1d gas of impenetrable ( hard - core ) bosons , also known as the tonks - giradeau ( tg ) gas .",
    "the strong interactions required for realizing the tg regime have been achieved in ultracold atom experiments in highly anisotropic traps  @xcite , and its spectacular dynamics in a quantum newton s cradle setting were observed in ref .",
    "as was discovered by marvin girardeau in 1960  @xcite , the impenetrability of bosons allows one to map the problem of many strongly interacting bosons to an ideal ( noninteracting ) gas of fermions .",
    "remarkably , this bose - fermi mapping and hence the exact integrability of the model works not only in the uniform limit but also for inhomogeneous systems @xcite , which allows for accurate tests of theory against experiments performed typically in harmonic ( inhomogeneous ) traps .",
    "thus , theoretical and experimental opportunities offered by the tg gas for understanding the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviour of strongly interacting quantum many - body systems are truly unique and remarkable . despite this , and despite the relatively long history behind the model , theoretical studies of tg gases have so far been limited to either zero- and finite - temperature _ equilibrium _ properties or",

    "use it to reveal a striking dynamical manifestation of the impenetrability of tg bosons  a quantum many - body bounce effect . in a simple two - body bounce scenario ,",
    "the problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_sketch ] . consider two particles in a harmonic trap at the opposite outer turning points of the classical motion : when the particles accelerate towards each other and meet at the bottom of the trapping potential , the noninteracting fermions `` pass '' freely through each other , moving with maximal and opposite momenta .",
    "two particles with hard - core interactions , on the other hand , will reflect elastically off each other .",
    "the main difference between these situations is that in the case of hard - core reflection the momentum of each particle becomes zero at the collision , so their momentum distribution differs considerably from that of free fermions .    to",
    "what extent this difference survives in a _ many - body _ collisional scenario is a nontrivial open question .",
    "here we apply our finite - temperature dynamical theory to the problem of breathing - mode oscillations of the tg gas and show that the quantum bounce phenomenon survives as a _ collective _ many - body effect .",
    "the effect , while being invisible in the evolution of the _ in - situ _ density profile of the tg gas , can be revealed through a nontrivial narrowing of its momentum distribution during breathing - mode oscillations .",
    "such a _ collective _ behaviour does not _ a priory _ follow from the respective collisional scenario at the simple _ two - particle _ level , and is absent in the respective noninteracting fermion problem which the bosonic solutions can be mapped to . as a very loose analogy ,",
    "the situation where a collective behaviour of a fluid can be revealed in its momentum distribution , but not in the real - space density , is somewhat reminiscent to detecting underwater rip currents behind an otherwise calm - looking ocean surface . as such",
    ", the idea of revealing collective manifestations of inter - particle interactions through the dynamics of the momentum distribution ( rather than the _ in - situ _ density profile ) can be applied to other interacting quantum fluids and other collisional scenario , and we envisage this method to become a valuable tool for characterising the out - of - equilibrium behaviour of such fluids .",
