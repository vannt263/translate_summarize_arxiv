    "rough sets were introduced in @xcite by z.  pawlak .",
    "the key idea is that our knowledge about the properties of the objects of a given universe of discourse @xmath1 may be inadequate or incomplete in the sense that the objects of the universe @xmath1 can be observed only within the accuracy of indiscernibility relations . according to pawlak s original definition ,",
    "an indiscernibility relation @xmath7 on @xmath1 is an equivalence relation interpreted so that two elements of @xmath1 are @xmath7-related if they can not be distinguished by their properties known by us .",
    "thus , indiscernibility relations allow us to partition a set of objects into classes of indistinguishable objects . for any subset @xmath4 , the _ lower approximation _",
    "@xmath8 of @xmath6 consists of elements such that their @xmath7-class is included in @xmath6 , and the _ upper approximation _",
    "@xmath9 of @xmath6 is the set of the elements whose @xmath7-class intersects with @xmath6 .",
    "this means that @xmath8 can be viewed as the set of elements certainly belonging to @xmath6 , because all elements @xmath7-related to them are also in @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , @xmath9 may be interpreted as the set of elements that possibly are in @xmath6 , because in @xmath6 there is at least one element indiscernible to them .",
    "the _ rough set _ of @xmath6 is the pair @xmath10 and the set of all rough sets is @xmath11 the set @xmath2 may be canonically ordered by the coordinatewise order : @xmath12    in @xcite it was proved that @xmath2 is a lattice which forms also a stone algebra .",
    "later this result was improved in @xcite by showing that @xmath2 is in fact a regular double stone algebra .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 determines also a three - valued ukasiewicz algebra and a semi - simple nelson algebra , because it is well known that these three types of algebras can be transformed to each other @xcite .    in the literature",
    "can be found numerous generalizations of rough sets such that equivalences are replaced by relations of different types .",
    "for instance , it is known that in the case of quasiorders ( reflexive and transitive binary relations ) , a nelson algebra such that the underlying rough set lattice is an algebraic lattice can be defined on @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "if rough sets are determined by relations that are symmetric and transitive , then the structure of @xmath2 is analogous to the case of equivalences @xcite . for a more general approach in the case of partial equivalences ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "there exist also studies in which approximation operators are defined in terms of an arbitrary binary relation  this idea was first proposed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "expansions of bounded distributive lattices equipped with a galois connection are represented in terms of rough approximation operators defined by arbitrary binary relations .",
    "one may also observe that in the current literature new approximation operators based on different viewpoints are constantly being proposed ( see e.g. @xcite for some recent studies ) .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that indiscernibility relations are tolerances ( reflexive and symmetric binary relations ) . the term _ tolerance relation _ was introduced in the context of visual perception theory by e.  c.  zeeman @xcite , motivated by the fact that indistinguishability of `` points '' in the visual world is limited by the discreteness of retinal receptors .",
    "one can argue that tolerances suit better for representing indistinguishability than equivalences , because transitivity is the least obvious property of indiscernibility .",
    "namely , we may have a finite sequence of objects @xmath13 such that each two consecutive objects @xmath14 and @xmath15 are indiscernible , but there is a notable difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is known @xcite that in the case of tolerances , @xmath2 is not necessarily a lattice if the cardinality of @xmath1 is greater than four .",
    "our main goals in this work are to find conditions under which @xmath2 forms a lattice , and , in case @xmath2 is a lattice , to study its properties .",
    "as mentioned , originally rough set approximations were defined in terms of equivalences , being bijectively related to partitions . in this paper , we consider tolerances , which are closely connected to coverings . in the literature can be found several ways to define approximations in terms of coverings ( see recent surveys in @xcite ) , and in this work we connect our approximation operators to some covering - based approximation operators , also .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we present the definition of rough approximation operators and present their essential properties . in addition , we give preliminaries of galois connections , ortholattices , and formal concepts . section  [ sec : toleranceapproximations ]",
    "is devoted to the rough set operators defined by tolerance relations .",
    "starting from the well - known fact that for any tolerance on @xmath1 , the pair @xmath18 is a galois connection on the power set lattice of @xmath1 and characterize rough set approximation pairs as certain kind of galois connections @xmath19 on a power set .",
    "we show that @xmath20 and @xmath21 form ortholattices and prove that these ortholattices are completely distributive if and only if @xmath0 is induced by an irredundant covering of @xmath1 .",
    "note that distributive ortholattices are boolean lattices , and a boolean lattice is atomistic if and only if it is completely distributive .",
    "this means that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are atomistic boolean lattices exactly when @xmath0 is induced by an irredundant covering of @xmath1 , and we describe the atoms of these lattices . in section  [ sec : orderedsets ] , we study the ordered set of rough sets @xmath2 and show that it can be up to isomorphism identified with a set of pairs @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are interior and closure operators on the set @xmath1 satisfying certain conditions . we prove that @xmath2 is a complete lattice if and only if it is a complete subdirect product of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we also show that @xmath2 is an algebraic completely distributive lattice if and only if @xmath0 is induced by an irredundant covering of @xmath1 , and in such a case , on @xmath2 a quasi - nelson algebra can be defined .",
    "the section ends with necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee that for a tolerance @xmath0 on @xmath1 , the ordered set @xmath3 is a lattice for all @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the restriction of @xmath0 to the set @xmath6 and @xmath3 is the set of all rough sets determined by @xmath5 .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : disjointrepresentations ] is devoted to the disjoint representation and the formal concept representation of rough sets .",
    "in particular , we prove that these representations are dedekind  macneille completions of @xmath2 .",

    "if we map the set @xmath526 by the isomorphism @xmath955 , we obtain the set @xmath965 the set @xmath966 is called the _ disjoint representation of rough sets_. obviously , the map @xmath958 defined in is a de  morgan operation on @xmath966 , and if @xmath2 is a complete lattice , then @xmath2 and @xmath966 can be identified by the map @xmath955 .",
    "we end this work by studying the connection between @xmath966 and the concept lattice @xmath109 defined by the context @xmath144 . in @xcite , it is considered for a concept @xmath103 of an arbitrary context its _ weak negation _ by @xmath967 and its _ weak opposition _ by @xmath968 especially , we are here considering the weak opposition operation @xmath969 , which satisfies for all concepts @xmath103 and @xmath970 : @xmath971 we already noted in section  [ sec : toleranceapproximations ] that the concept lattice of the context @xmath144 is @xmath972 , where @xmath85 is the orthocomplement operation of @xmath22 .",

    "we define the set @xmath981 and we call it the _ formal concept representation of rough sets_. we order the set @xmath982 by the order of @xmath975 .",

    "@xmath982 is a complete sublattice of @xmath983 .",

    "if @xmath987 , then @xmath988 thus , @xmath474 is an order - embedding . if @xmath989 , then @xmath152 and @xmath990 .",
    "therefore , the map @xmath474 is also onto , and it is an order - isomorphism .",
    "next , we prove that @xmath982 is the image of @xmath966 under @xmath474 .",
    "note first that for all @xmath152 , @xmath991 since @xmath992 , we have that @xmath993 additionally , @xmath994 . these facts imply @xmath995 since @xmath474 is a bijection , we get @xmath996 hence , @xmath474 determines an order - isomorphism between the complete lattices @xmath966 and @xmath982 , which proves ( b ) .    because @xmath526 is a complete sublattice of @xmath452 by proposition  [ prop : completion](b )",
    ", its image @xmath966 under the isomorphism @xmath997 is a complete sublattice of @xmath166 .",

    ", it is easy to see that @xmath1001 is a de  morgan operation on @xmath982 . up to isomorphism",
    ", this operation is the same as in @xmath526 and @xmath966 .",
    "namely , if @xmath1002 , then @xmath1003    we conclude this section by giving the following summary of rough representations :    * for any tolerance @xmath0 on @xmath1 , the representations @xmath526 , @xmath966 , and @xmath982 are dedekind  macneille completions of @xmath2 equipped with de  morgan operations satisfying ( k3 ) that are identical up to isomorphism . * the ordered sets @xmath2 and @xmath957 are isomorphic , and they are complete lattices if and only if @xmath2 is a complete sublattice of @xmath452 , or , equivalently , @xmath957 is a complete sublattice of @xmath1004 . *",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath957 are complete lattices , then they are identical to @xmath526 and @xmath966 , respectively .",
    "this implies also @xmath1005 . *",
    "if @xmath0 induced by an irredundant covering of @xmath1 , then @xmath2 , @xmath957 , @xmath526 , @xmath966 , and @xmath982 determine isomorphic quasi - nelson algebras .",
    "in this work , we have considered rough set systems determined by so - called element - based approximation pairs induced by a tolerance relation . for any tolerance",
    ", we were able to give the dedekind ",
    "macneille completion of @xmath2 in terms of formal concept analysis , and also in the terms of increasing and , respectively , disjoint representations . under some certain conditions , the rough set system @xmath2 forms a complete lattices .",
    "particularly , if the tolerance is induced by an irredundant covering of the universe , its rough set lattice is algebraic and completely distribute , and a kleene algebra ( in fact , even a quasi - nelson algebra ) may be defined on it .",
    "we learned that weak similarity satisfies condition ( c ) in the case attributes are two - valued , but this is generally no longer true even for three - valued attributes .",
    "additionally , we observed that tolerances induced by irredundant coverings arise in incomplete and approximate information systems in the presence of learning examples .",
    "we also would like to emphasize that if we have a finite universe @xmath1 and we want that the rough set lattice @xmath2 is distributive , this means that necessarily @xmath2 is determined by a tolerance induced by an irredundant covering .",
    "this is because if a finite lattice is distributive , it is also completely distributive .",
    "since quite often in studies of rough set theory it is assumed that the universe is finite , this means that case of @xmath2 forming a distributive lattice is completely characterized .    in the future",
    ", we will study under which conditions rough sets systems determined by tolerances define nelson algebras or 3-valued ukasiewicz algebras , because it is known that in case of quasiorders the rough set systems form nelson algebras , and in the particular case of equivalences , these systems define 3-valued ukasiewicz algebras .",
    "we propose a deeper analysis of the tolerance relations induced by irredundant coverings , and their relations to information systems .",
    "it might also be fruitful to study lattice - theoretical properties of completions considered in section  [ sec : disjointrepresentations ] , that is , how the properties of the ortholattices @xmath179 effect to the completions .",
    "these constructions may have some similarities to the one of sendlewski @xcite or they could be based on generalizations of heyting algebras @xcite , for instance .",
    "finally , we note that it still remains an open question under which condition on the tolerance @xmath0 , the rough set system forms a lattice .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referees and yiyu yao for their constructive comments ."
