    "recently , both the atlas and cms collaborations have reported an excess of events in the diphoton channel at a reconstructed invariant mass of about 750 gev .",
    "this excess is visible in both the 13 tev only  @xcite and @xmath4 tev  @xcite lhc data analyses .",
    "the atlas collaboration reports a local signal significance of @xmath5 from an integrated luminosity of 3.2 @xmath6 at 13  tev , and about 1.9 @xmath7 from 20.3 @xmath6 of 8 tev data .",
    "the cms collaboration likewise reports a local signal significance of 3.4 @xmath7 from combined luminosities of 3.3 and 19.7 @xmath6 at 13 and 8 tev , respectively .",
    "cms finds the observed significance to be maximized for a narrow decay width @xmath8 , while the atlas data is reported to favor a larger width with @xmath9 .",
    "the collection of more data is necessary to clarify the status of the observed excess and the associated decay width .",
    "a straightforward approach to explaining the diphoton excess is the introduction of a standard model ( sm ) singlet @xmath10 with a mass of 750  gev accompanied by multiplets of vector - like particles  @xcite . with vector - like particles in the loops",
    ", the singlet @xmath10 can be produced via gluon fusion , and can likewise decay into a diphoton pair .",
    "the vector - like particles can solve the vacuum stability problem  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to masses of the chiral fermions of the sm , the masses of the vector - like quark and lepton are not tied to the electroweak ( ew ) scale , since they do not arise from the breakdown of the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "the natural question that arises is whether we may introduce a new symmetry that can be broken down at the tev scale to generate masses for the vector - like fermions . in this paper",
    ", we employ the gauge group @xmath0 , placing the sm quarks , leptons and also the new vector - like quarks and leptons into anomaly free @xmath11 , @xmath3 and @xmath3 representations .",
    "@xmath0 is a subgroup of the anomaly - free exceptional group @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 , implying that our results may likewise be embedded within the context of an @xmath12 model . in our scenario ,",
    "the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken down to @xmath14 at the gut scale , and the residual @xmath1 gauge symmetry is broken at the tev scale by the vev of sm singlets belonging to @xmath2 and @xmath15 , producing vector - like masses for 3 generations of new down - type quarks and lepton doublets . the ratio of vector - like quark and lepton masses @xmath16 gets fixed .",
    "the 750 gev resonance arises from a scalar field which is the sm singlet within a @xmath2 of @xmath0 . the sm is subsequently broken at the weak scale .",
    "in addition to the new vector - like quarks and leptons , the adoption of fundamental representations of @xmath0 also naturally implies two sets of sm singlets carrying the @xmath17 charge for each generation which develop majorana masses @xmath18 tev .",
    "one set of particles interacts with the sm leptons and will be responsible for the lightness of the neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the lightest component of the second set will be a dark matter ( dm ) candidate .",
    "we also investigate the gauge coupling unification in this model .",
    "in section 2 we detail the @xmath0 model and discuss the vector - like particle masses , neutrinos , and dm . in section 3",
    "we discuss the gauge unification and gut symmetry breaking . in section 4",
    "we discuss the diphoton excess and predict cross - sections for various other final states in the context of the @xmath0 model . in section 5",
    "we conclude .",
    "in order to explain the observed excess of events around 750 gev in the diphoton channel , we need to introduce new particles beyond the sm spectrum at a low scale . particles with fermionic degrees of freedom are slightly better motivated than scalars , since their loop - induced contributions are larger , in general . also , mass stability is much easier to explain in the fermionic case .",
    "it is very natural to ask about an underlying mechanism for the introduction of new vector - like particles into the spectrum , and whether the necessary fields are an arbitrary choice or one governed by the enlarged symmetry structure of some grand unified theory ( gut ) . in particular , we are interested in the question of what dynamics may protect the tev scale masses of these particles from gut or planck scale corrections . whereas the sm fermions neatly fit into representations of @xmath19 or @xmath20 , the minimal group structure which provides natural unification of the sm chiral fermions with additional particles transforming as vector - like particles under the sm gauge symmetry is the @xmath0 gut .",
    "the smallest anomaly - free set of chiral representations which fulfill this purpose ( for one particle generation ) in the @xmath0 gut are @xmath21 the @xmath22 and @xmath11 dimensional representations decompose under the the gauge symmetry as follows .",
    "@xmath23 here we are using the common notation @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for the sm fermions .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are vector - like particles arising from @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are singlet fermions . for simplicity ,",
    "we presently consider @xmath27 , and @xmath28 to be elements of the @xmath37 representation , while the new vector - like particles are in @xmath38 .",
    "however , as we shall elaborate later , the physical sm @xmath27 , and @xmath28 will actually arise from a superposition of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the additional vector - like particles can only obtain mass once the rank of the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "specifically , the vector - like particles are chiral under the residual @xmath1 subgroup of @xmath0 , and will remain massless until this symmetry is broken .",
    "we consider the scenario where @xmath0 is broken at the gut scale to @xmath39 , and the @xmath1 breaking scale is around a tev .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 gut may facilitate a well - defined vector - like particle spectrum with a common mass scale around a tev .",
    "the yukawa sector in our model has the following form .",
    "@xmath40 we have suppressed family and gauge indices for simplicity . in order to generate the sm fermion masses and mixing , as well as the vector - like particle masses , we need to introduce the following @xmath0 representation for the higgs field .",
    "@xmath41 the up - type higgs lives in @xmath42 , the down - type higgs lives in @xmath43 , and the sm singlet field which can break the extra @xmath44 symmetry is in @xmath45 .",
    "we need to introduce two different representations , i.e. @xmath46 , for the sm higgs fields in order to have realistic quark and lepton masses .",
    "the reason for this is that taking only a single representation @xmath43 ( or @xmath42 ) will lead to a non - renormalizable coupling for one of the yukawas  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the non - renormalizable coupling in @xmath47 would lead to a very small effective yukawa coupling to the up type quarks , since the singlet field responsible for @xmath44 symmetry breaking takes a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at the tev scale in our scenario .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) characterizes the up - type quark mass matrix and mixing .",
    "the second term does the same for down - type quark and charged leptons .",
    "the assumption that @xmath27 , and @xmath28 live only in the @xmath37 representation implies @xmath48-@xmath49 yukawa coupling unification at the gut scale .",
    "this condition is problematic , since the @xmath48 and @xmath49 yukawa couplings meet each other around @xmath50 gev in the sm if we run under the renormalization group equations ( rges ) from low scale to high .",
    "however , considering instead that @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are superpositions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 breaks the @xmath48-@xmath49 yukawa unification condition such that there is no conflict with experimental data .",
    "this mixing between the sm particles and the vector - particle particles is likewise helpful  @xcite to explain the bnl muon @xmath51 data  @xcite . the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) provides for dirac neutrino masses .",
    "the final term in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) generates vector - like masses for the new particles when the sm singlet component in @xmath52 generates a vev which breaks the @xmath1 symmetry around the tev scale , and moreover provides the scalar particle candidate ( @xmath10 ) responsible for the observed 750  gev resonance .",
    "+    _ neutrino mass and dark matter _",
    "+ in order to avoid cosmological constraints on the number of degrees of freedom for massless particles  @xcite , we need to generate a large mass for each of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 fields , one of which we will consider as a right - handed neutrino which interacts with the sm like @xmath28 .",
    "the singlets @xmath53 and @xmath54 can acquire majorana mass from the interaction @xmath55 the @xmath15 dimensional representation of @xmath0 contains single @xmath56 under the sm gauge symmetry @xcite .",

    "the unification solution is not greatly affected by small variation of the vector - like mass scale within the physical window , nor even by omission of these fields ( except for a reduction in @xmath94 ) .",

    "however , it is not phenomenologically necessary to consider such an extreme splitting .",
