    "principal aims of current studies of galaxy formation and evolution include the exploration of the interplay between the gaseous and stellar components of galaxies and the mechanisms which trigger the conversion of gas into stars . during the last decade ,",
    "wide area surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) have enabled statistical studies of star formation ( sf ) in the local universe .",
    "for example , galaxies which are currently forming stars , the so - called `` blue - cloud galaxies '' in the color - magnitude diagram @xcite , occupy a relatively narrow `` star - forming sequence '' in a plot of specific star formation rate ( @xmath5 ) versus stellar mass @xmath3 @xcite , with the ssfr declining as the stellar mass increases .",
    "such a trend suggests that the galaxy s stellar mass regulates the overall star formation history ( sfh ) , at least at intermediate masses .",
    "this star - forming sequence breaks down above @xmath6 , where the `` red sequence '' , occupied by massive galaxies having lower values of the ssfr , becomes more prominent .",
    "the importance of the gaseous component is reflected in the kennicutt - schmidt law which relates the gas column density ( @xmath7 ) to the sfr surface density ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "a super - linear slope is sometimes reached , e.g. @xmath9 as in @xcite , indicating that the star formation efficiency is higher in regions of higher gas surface density .",
    "however , the empirical relations among galaxy properties which are derived from such surveys apply to the galaxy populations which dominate them , typically the more massive and luminous galaxies",
    ". the same relations may not apply to dwarf or low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "of particular relevance to this work , in such objects the environment where star formation occurs may be quite different .",
    "compared to the optically bright and massive systems which dominate the sdss , gas - rich dwarf galaxies are often underrepresented in samples selected by stellar mass .",
    "often the optical emission arising in such systems is very blue , patchy and of very low surface brightness or small in extent . however , gas - rich , low mass , low metallicity , low optical surface brightness galaxies are important to the study of star formation because the processes by which gas is converted into stars within such systems may mimic those which occurred in the early universe . as the most chemically unevolved systems within the present - day galaxy population , the faintest dwarfs represent unique laboratories for understanding star formation and galaxy evolution in extreme environments , that is , in regimes of low metallicity , low dust content , low pressure , low shear , and low escape velocity @xcite .",
    "several recent works suggest that the star formation in dwarf galaxies may proceed quite differently from that in large spirals .",
    "based on a sample of very local dwarf irregular galaxies , the faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey ( figgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , found a lower average @xmath8 than would be expected from the kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite .",
    "moreover , no threshold density is observed below which star formation is completely turned off .",
    "recently , @xcite explored the distribution of the ssfr against absolute magnitude for a complete sample of @xmath10300 star - forming galaxies within 11 mpc of the milky way , from the 11mpc h@xmath11 uv galaxy survey ( 11hugs ) .",
    "in addition to confirming the transition in star formation activity at the high mass end , those authors found a second transition , with low luminosity dwarf galaxies ( @xmath12 ) having a very large spread in their ssfrs .",
    "this second transition suggests that the star - forming behavior may be distinct at the lowest mass range . after showing that other potential drivers are not able to explain the magnitude of observed systematics , @xcite",
    "suggest that the over - prediction of the sfr by the uv flux compared to that estimated from h@xmath11 in dwarf systems is consistent with an imf deficient in the most massive stars .",
    "however , those authors also point out that it is possible that some combination of effects may conspire to produce the observed trend , and thus the requirement of systematic variations in the imf can be avoided .",
    "the 11hugs sample is complete in hi mass only above @xmath13 , becoming rapidly incomplete at smaller hi masses . to develop further the current understanding of how the gas supply regulates star formation in the lowest mass systems , a larger sample of extreme dwarf galaxies",
    "is needed . making use of the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) ,",
    "the on - going arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) extragalactic hi line survey is specially designed to identify low mass , gas rich objects in the local universe @xcite .",
    "because of its combination of wide areal coverage , sensitivity , and velocity resolution , alfalfa has already detected more than 400 galaxies with hi masses @xmath14 @xcite . while star formation is more directly linked to the molecular interstellar component",
    ", the detection of co in low - metallicity dwarfs is difficult ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , suggesting further that co no longer traces h@xmath15 well .",
    "furthermore , in many gas - rich dwarf galaxies , the hi component dominates both the gas as well as the baryonic mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the combination of hi parameters from alfalfa with complementary multi - wavelength data contributed by sdss and galex provides an ideal dataset to investigate the abundance and distribution of gas - rich dwarfs and to explore the relations among their gas content , stellar populations and star formation properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sample ]",
    "we define our hi - selected sample and present its basic gas properties . in  [ data ] we present the supplementary sdss and galex data , especially our re - processed uv photometry . the directly measured colors and selected spectroscopic behavior are also briefly examined . in  [ prop ]",
    "we describe how we utilize sed fitting techniques to obtain physical parameters for the dwarfs , e.g. , @xmath3 and the dust extinction - corrected sfr .",
    "we discuss in  [ sfgas ] the relations between gas , star and star formation in dwarfs , and how they compare to the overall alfalfa hi - selected population .",
    "a summary is presented in ",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "all the distance - dependent quantities in this work are computed assuming @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , and a @xcite imf is adopted .",
    "in this section , we use the 40% alfalfa catalog ( @xmath11.40 : * ? ? ? * ) to define two hi - selected dwarf galaxy samples , one of which is complete in hi mass and velocity width ( _ s - com _ ) . the second sample ( _ s - sup _ ) is less restrictive in those parameters but supplements the first through the availability of deeper galex nuv / fuv observations .",
    "we discuss here the selection of these two samples and their hi properties . in  [ sed ] , we will define a third sample _ s - sed _ as a subset of dwarfs among the _ s - com _ and _ s - sup _ samples .",
    "begun in 2005 , the alfalfa survey has been using the 7-beam alfa receiver to conduct a blind search for hi sources with @xmath19 km s@xmath2 over 7000 deg@xmath20 of high galactic latitude sky @xcite .",
    "the targeted regions cover the sky visible to arecibo @xmath21 dec .",
    "@xmath22 in both the spring ( @xmath23 r.a .",
    "@xmath24 ) and fall ( @xmath25 r.a .",
    "@xmath26 ) night sky . with a median @xmath27 of @xmath108200 km s@xmath2 , alfalfa for the first time",
    "samples the hi population over a cosmologically fair volume , and is expected to detect @xmath1030,000 extragalactic hi - line sources out to redshifts of @xmath28 . as a second generation wide area hi survey , alfalfa is designed to greatly improve on the hi census derived from previous results .",
    "for example , alfalfa is 8 times more sensitive than the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass * ? ? ? * ) , with 4 times the angular resolution and 3 times the velocity resolution , all of which are essential to the discovery of the lowest hi mass objects . in particular , hipass detected only 11 objects with @xmath29 @xcite whereas alfalfa is detecting hundreds of such low mass systems .",
    "for example , at the distance of the virgo cluster , alfalfa is sensitive down to @xmath30 for sources with s / n @xmath106.5 @xcite .",
    "in addition , hi source positions derived from alfalfa can be determined with a median accuracy of about 20@xmath31 ( see eqn 1 of * ? ? ? * ) , allowing the identification of optical / uv counterparts for the vast majority of hi sources without the need for follow - up synthesis mapping .",
    "while source confusion within the 3.5@xmath32 arcmin beam can affect sources at large distance , it has little effect on the identification of nearby dwarfs , except when they are located in close proximity to giant neighbors .",
    "the current alfalfa survey , `` @xmath33 '' , covers @xmath34 of the final survey area , and includes a catalog of 15855 hi sources , 15041 of which are extragalactic @xcite .",
    "the remainder have no optical counterparts ( ocs ) and lie at low velocities which are consistent with galactic phenomena , e.g. , as high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) .",
    "alfalfa hi detections are further categorized by source reliability : code 1 sources are reliable extragalactic detections with high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath35 ) while code 2 sources , also known as `` priors '' , have lower s / n ( @xmath36 ) but coincide with an oc of known optical redshift matching the hi measurement .",
    "the hvcs are identified as code 9 objects .",
    "further details are given in @xcite .",
    "hi masses in units of solar mass are obtained from the relation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the distance in mpc and @xmath39 is the integrated hi line flux density in units of jy km s@xmath2 . in the local universe ,",
    "distance determinations suffer significantly from the uncertainty introduced by a galaxy s peculiar velocity . in order to minimize the hi mass error introduced by the uncertainty in distances",
    ", we adopt a peculiar velocity flow model which incorporates both primary distances available from the literature and secondary distances derived from the sfi++ survey @xcite . the flow model derived by @xcite",
    "is adopted for galaxies with @xmath40 6000 km s@xmath2 , while distances for more distant objects are derived from redshifts in the cmb rest frame .",
    "primary distances are assigned to individual galaxies wherever available from the literature , and following the method discussed in @xcite , galaxies identified as members of groups and clusters are placed at the distance to their assigned hierarchical unit . we have been conservative in ambiguous cases , assigning larger distances where a choice is given to avoid the inclusion of higher mass galaxies in the present analysis .",
    "all of the spring sky coverage of alfalfa and part of the fall sky survey region overlap the footprint of the sdss legacy survey , thereby allowing a direct cross - match of the two . as part of the alfalfa catalog production process ,",
    "the hi detections have been crossed matched to sdss dr7 photometric objects for 12470 of the @xmath33 hi detections @xcite . through sed fitting to the five sdss photometric bands ( see  [ sed ] ) , we are able to derive additional basic properties of the full @xmath33-sdss hi selected parent sample . a more detailed discussion of the @xmath33-sdss - galex sample in general , as well as the selection effects characteristic of the @xmath33 survey will be presented in @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the identification of ocs to the @xmath33 hi sources and the cross match to the sdss dr7 is not a perfect process ; in individual cases , the wrong counterpart may have been selected , the sdss photometry may be bad etc .",
    "however , the cross match with the sdss dr7 allows us to make a first statistical study of the relationships between gas , stars and star formation , and provides us with a parent sample of gas - rich galaxies within which we can explore the distinctiveness of the lowest hi mass systems .      the studies which infer global properties derived from the sdss main galaxy catalog are highly biased against the inclusion of dwarf irregular galaxies because of the magnitude and surface brightness limits on the sdss spectroscopic targets ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 mag arcsec@xmath43 ) .",
    "since @xmath44 increases with decreasing @xmath45 , hi - selected samples are more inclusive of star - forming galaxies than optical samples of similar depth . because of their relatively young stellar populations and low dust contents , gas - rich dwarfs are typically blue and often patchy in optical appearance ;",
    "at the same time , they are often extended and diffuse in hi .",
    "since the cold gas is the fuel needed to sustain star - formation , a blind hi survey of sufficient depth , like alfalfa , is especially effective in identifying star forming systems at the low mass end , and hence should offer a full census of star forming galaxies in the local universe .    in order to identify a sample of low mass , gas - rich dwarfs ,",
    "we have applied selection criteria to the @xmath33 catalog as follows : ( i ) alfalfa detection code = 1 or 2 ( reliable sources and priors , but no hvcs ) ; ( ii ) @xmath46 ; ( iii ) velocity width of the hi line , @xmath47 km s@xmath2 ; ( iv ) the optical images were visually inspected to eliminate the ones without optical counterparts , those which appear to be more massive but hi - deficient galaxies . following the detailed analysis of the hi mass error in @xcite and @xcite , the @xmath48 error in the @xmath49 bin is @xmath50 dex .",
    "hence , requirement ( ii ) ensures that we are unlikely to miss dwarfs with @xmath51 due to their hi mass error .",
    "criterion ( iii ) helps to insure that we include only truly low mass systems .",
    "based on criterion ( iv ) , 2 gas - poor face - on giant galaxies ( ugc  7622 = ngc  4469 and ugc  7718 = ngc  4526 ) have been removed .",
    "both have sdss @xmath52-band absolute petrosian magnitudes brighter than @xmath53 and are early type spirals situated in the virgo cluster ; their hi masses and velocity widths are unusually low , probably due to interaction within the cluster environment .",
    "additionally , extragalactic hi sources without ocs ( 38 of them ) are dropped . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the majority of those are part of the extended hi structures in the leo region : the leo ring and leo triplet @xcite or are similar fragments associated with nearby groups of galaxies . with these objects",
    "removed , the final complete alfalfa dwarf galaxy sample , referred to hereafter as _ s - com _ , contains 176 galaxies .",
    "the designation of ` complete ' for this hi - selected sample emphasizes that it is a complete subset of the @xmath33 catalog . because the alfalfa sensitivity depends not only on the integrated flux but also on the profile width",
    ", there is no simple translation of a limiting flux to the lower limit on the hi mass but the completeness can be well characterized @xcite . of particular relevance here , we note that , at the mean @xmath54 km s@xmath2 of the _ s - com _ galaxies , @xmath33 is 90% complete to @xmath55 and 25% complete to @xmath56 , within a distance of 11mpc . in comparison , the 11hugs sample is complete in @xmath48 only to @xmath57 @xcite within the same distance . while we include all the low hi mass detections in the _ s - com _ sample out to a distance of @xmath10 30  mpc , the @xmath33 completeness limit at that distance is well above the hi mass upper limit of the _ s - com _",
    "sample , @xmath58 .",
    "s - com _ sample is not complete in a volume - limited sense , but it does probe the extreme low hi mass tail of the @xmath33 catalog .      since alfalfa is an on - going survey , its catalog of hi detections continues to grow with time .",
    "similarly , the simultaneous undertaking of the galex satellite mission has provided some opportunity to obtain images in the nuv and fuv bands for early alfalfa detections , at least until the galex fuv channel failure in 2009 .",
    "because exploration of the population of galaxies which define the low mass end of the hi mass function ( himf ) has always been one of the main goals of alfalfa , we proposed to obtain galex mis ( medium imaging survey ) level fuv and nuv observations of low hi mass targets , based on early releases of the alfalfa catalog , in galex cycles 3 , 4 and 5 ( gi3 - 84 , gi4 - 42 and gi5 - 2 ) .",
    "as alfalfa has progressed , the identification of the lowest hi mass population has likewise been an ongoing process , extending to lower hi masses as its catalog of hi sources has grown .",
    "hence , the complete @xmath33 low mass sample _ s - com _ as defined above is more restrictive in hi mass than our galex target dwarf galaxy lists which were based on early alfalfa catalogs . fortunately , although the criteria for the galex target selection derived from the early alfalfa catalogs were less restrictive in terms of hi mass and velocity width , the alfalfa - based galex targets are nonetheless of relatively low mass . of the 77 galaxies for which we acquired galex fuv / nuv observations , 24 overlap with the strictly complete sample _ s - com_. the remaining 53 galaxies have somewhat higher hi masses ( see discussion in  [ hiprop ] ) ; we refer to this supplementary sample as _ s - sup_. while the _ s - sup _ sample is not complete in any sense , the availability of galex mis - depth imaging in both fuv and nuv bands for its galaxies allows us to explore with better statistics the low hi mass systems so that we can test for trends ( or thresholds ) with hi mass at the low mass end of the himf .      the combination of the two samples _ s - com _ and _ s - sup _ yields a final alfalfa - selected set of 229 low hi mass and low velocity width dwarf galaxies upon which we base the analysis presented here . table [ table : dwarf ] presents the relevant uv , sdss and hi properties for them .",
    "columns are as follows :    * column(1 ) : alfalfa catalog identifier ( also known as the agc number ) .",
    "* columns(2 ) and ( 3 ) : j2000 position of the oc assigned to the hi source .",
    "* columns(4 ) and ( 5 ) : the adopted fuv and nuv magnitudes , with their associated error , respectively , as derived via our reprocessing of the galex images ( see  [ gdata ] ) . * column(6 ) : the @xmath52-band _ modelmag _ with its associated error , from the sdss pipeline . * column(7 ) : the @xmath59 color with its associated error , from the sdss pipeline . * column(8 ) : the sdss code sflag indicating the quality of sdss photometry as defined in  [ sdssdata ] . * column(9 ) : the adopted distance with error , in mpc . * column(10 ) : the logarithm of the hi mass and its error , taken from the @xmath33 catalog @xcite . * column(11 ) : the logarithm of the stellar mass and its error , derived from sed fitting ( see  [ smass ] ) * column(12 ) : the logarithm of the sfr and its error , in solar masses per year ( see  [ sfr ] )    figure [ fig : sample5 ] shows histograms of the recessional velocity @xmath27 , adopted distance , observed hi line width and logarithm of the hi mass for the combined alfalfa dwarf sample , with shaded areas identifying the complete sample , _ s - com _ and the open areas indicating the additional _ s - sup _ galaxies . as expected since the lowest hi masses are detected only nearby , most galaxies lie within the local supercluster at @xmath60 3000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the peak in the distance distribution at 16.7 mpc arises from the assignment of virgo membership to a significant number of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "a cross match with the vcc catalog @xcite shows that there are 37 virgo members belonging to the dwarf sample defined here ( 35 in _ s - com _ and 2 in _ s - sup _ ) .",
    "the dashed vertical line in the hi line width histogram corresponds to the adopted line width cutoff , @xmath61 80 km s@xmath2 . the mean uncertainty on the line width measurement is 6.7 km s@xmath2 .",
    "note that only one galaxy in the _ s - com _ sample is included in the last bin below this cutoff , suggesting that the low hi mass and narrow line width criteria are consistent : we are not missing a population of high line width but still low mass dwarfs because our line width cutoff is set to be too narrow , and the low hi mass criterion is more important than the narrow line width one in the definition of the _ s - com _ sample . in agreement with this point , a quick check of the _ s - sup _ galaxies reveals the fact that they all have @xmath62 , although by the definition of the _ s - com _ subset",
    ", it is possible that galaxies in the _ s - sup _ sample could have @xmath63 but @xmath64 80 km s@xmath2 . in another words , the supplemental sample _ s - sup",
    "_ does not include low mass dwarf galaxies which are excluded from the _ s - com _ one through the restriction to the velocity width , @xmath61 80 km s@xmath2 . as anticipated , galaxies in the _ s - sup _ sample span a wider range of @xmath65 and distance than the stricter low hi mass sample . in the histogram of @xmath48 ,",
    "the low mass tail extends to @xmath666 ; the sharp edge at @xmath67 ( our upper limit for _ s - com _ ) reflects the fact that the _ s - sup _ galaxies represent only a small subset of the @xmath33 galaxies in the higher hi mass range .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite shows the similar distributions for the full @xmath33 catalog .",
    "previous studies of dwarf galaxies have focused mainly on optically selected samples and contain relatively few objects with @xmath63 .",
    "for example , the figgs sample of @xcite contains only 41 galaxies with @xmath63 , compared to 176 in the alfalfa _ s - com _ sample .",
    "the majority of the figgs targets lie within 8 mpc and have been selected from existing optical surveys .",
    "similarly , the volume - limited 11hugs sample is complete in @xmath68 to @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "in fact , only seven of the _ s - com _ plus _ s - sup _ galaxies are included in the 11hugs catalog ; at the same time , 54 of the alfalfa dwarfs lie at distances of less than 11 mpc .",
    "figure [ fig : plothi ] shows a spaenhauer plot of hi mass versus distance for the alfalfa dwarfs , with filled circles denoting the _ s - com _ members .",
    "the lower edge of the distribution represents the alfalfa sensitivity limit @xcite .",
    "compared to the similar plot in figure 1 from @xcite , the distribution of alfalfa dwarfs is shifted towards the lower hi mass range , just where the deviation of the uv - based sfr from that inferred from h@xmath11 is more likely to show up @xcite . benefiting from its improved sensitivity and angular and spectral resolution , the alfalfa survey catalog allows us to draw a statistically significant sample of the lowest hi mass galaxies in the local universe .",
    "in this section , we describe the galex and sdss datasets used , including reprocessed uv photometry from galex . in addition , the uv - to - optical color and emission - line diagnostics critical to the appraisal of star formation in the dwarf galaxies are discussed .      in dusty starbursting galaxies , a dominant fraction of the uv emission",
    "may be obscured by dust and reprocessed at fir wavelengths @xcite . in red sequence galaxies ,",
    "older evolved stars make significant contributions to the uv luminosity @xcite .",
    "however , the alfalfa - selected dwarf galaxies are likely to suffer less from extinction and their young stellar populations contribute the bulk of the uv light .",
    "the fuv luminosity @xmath70 is generally thought to give the most robust measure of the sfr in individual galaxies with low total sfrs and low dust attenuation .",
    "dwarfs are known to be low in metallicity and dust content , so that ir indicators of the sfr , which are calibrated via massive spirals , may be less reliable .",
    "in contrast to h@xmath11 emission , fuv photons primarily originate in the more abundant and relatively longer - lived population of b - stars so that the fuv flux is not as vulnerable to stochastic effects .",
    "furthermore , fuv photons are emitted directly from the stellar photospheres , and thus do not suffer from possible uncertainties in the photoionization of the gas in low density media @xcite .    in order to explore the uv properties of the faint and low surface brightness galaxies in the alfalfa dwarfs , we examined all available moderate exposure ( mis - depth ) galex images coincident with them , including both ones from our own gi programs as well as others available in the galex archive .",
    "galex simultaneously imaged the sky in the fuv ( effective wavelength of 1516  @xmath71 ) and nuv ( effective wavelength of 2267  @xmath71 ) , with a circular field of view of @xmath72 in diameter @xcite .",
    "the images were processed through the galex pipeline , and the intensity maps with a 1.5@xmath31 pixel scale were retrieved . with typical exposure times of @xmath101500 sec ,",
    "the images reach limiting magnitudes of @xmath1022.7 mag in both the fuv and nuv , corresponding to surface brightness limits of @xmath1027.5 mag arcsec@xmath2 or a sfr of @xmath73 @xcite . as discussed in ",
    "[ sample ] , all 53 _ s - sup _ galaxies were included in our galex gi programs , though five of them were only observed in the nuv due to the failure of the fuv detector . since the final _ s - com _ sample was extracted from the @xmath33 catalog after the fuv channel was completely turned off , we also searched the galex archive for any additional mis - depth images with adequate coverage of alfalfa dwarf galaxies . among the final alfalfa - galex",
    "/ mis sample of 77 _ s - com _ galaxies , seven were observed in the nuv only .    using a standard ellipse fitting extraction of the magnitudes ( galphot ;",
    "see below ) , 67 of the 70 extreme dwarfs in the _ s - com _ sample are clearly detected in the fuv band .",
    "two of the remaining three are extremely faint and lsb in the fuv , but magnitudes are still measurable in concentric apertures ( elphot ; see below ) . furthermore , @xmath74 of the sources in the higher hi mass supplementary _ s - sup _ sample which have fuv images are detected in fuv .",
    "thus , only @xmath75 out of the 118 dwarfs in the combined _ s - com _ plus _ s - sup _ sample with fuv mis level images is a non - detection .",
    "a similarly high detection rate was found by @xcite .",
    "only 22 of the 390 galaxies in their 11hugs sample observed by galex were not detected in fuv . about half of these are galaxies classified as faint dwarf ellipticals / spheroidals ( de / dsph ) and lack any evidence of recent star formation ; nearly all the others were found in images of exposure times less than 200 sec .",
    "those authors concluded that , despite the variable , episodic or bursty star formation histories of dwarfs , the fluctuations in the sfr do not go to zero on timescales comparable to the lifetimes of uv emitting stars ( @xmath10100 myr ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite propose the need to examine the possible complete cessation of sf in low luminosity systems via an hi selected sample probing masses down to @xmath76 , exactly what the alfalfa _ s - com _ sample is .",
    "the presence of hi selects against the very gas - poor de / dsph population , so our even higher fuv detection rate is not unexpected .",
    "this result clearly suggests that virtually all hi - bearing dwarf galaxies exhibit some level of recent star formation .      because we rely mainly on the fuv luminosity to infer sfrs , it is essential to obtain accurate fuv photometry",
    ". given the typical faint , lsb and patchy nature of the uv emission of dwarf galaxies , extra attention must be paid to the extraction of magnitudes .",
    "the standard galex pipeline , which is based on the sextractor code @xcite , suffers from shredding if multiple star forming sites are resolved .",
    "it also suffers from blending if foreground stars or uv - bright background galaxies are viewed in projection with the target galaxy .",
    "additionally , the background determination matters more than that in high surface brightness regions , since the background subtraction uncertainty , rather than the photon noise , dominates in lsb regions @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", we developed our own tools to perform the photometric extraction on the galex images of the alfalfa dwarf galaxies .",
    "for each of the target galaxies , we extracted a portion of the intensity map retrieved from the mast website . further reduction of the image was performed within the iraf / stsdas environment using a set of scripts developed for previous i - band imaging surveys undertaken by our group , referred to as the galphot package @xcite , and appropriately modified to accommodate the galex images .",
    "because the morphology of galaxies in the fuv is not necessarily the same as in the nuv , and because foreground stars are often much brighter in the nuv images , we elected to work on the two channels separately rather than adopt a single identical set of apertures .",
    "a constant value associated with the sky background was subtracted using a procedure that allows the user to mark boxes that are free of bright stars and galaxies on each frame .",
    "the boxes are placed so that they surround the target galaxy but are far enough from it to avoid the influence of faint extended emission .",
    "in contrast to the circumstances applied to optical images , the uv sky is so dark that the pixel values in sky boxes follow a poisson distribution rather than a gaussian one . the subtracted sky value in the uv case is the mean intensity obtained within the sky boxes after iteratively clipping out the pixels whose values are more than 3@xmath77 above the mean value , a process which removes the faint stars and galaxies within the sky boxes .",
    "usually this process converges quickly after 1 or 2 clipping cycles .    to clean the regions over which the galaxy photometry is to be derived , we first used an automatic procedure to mask uv sources at least 2 galaxy radii away from its center , and then masked by hand sources within 2 radii deemed to be unrelated to the galaxy itself .",
    "starting from an initial guess marked by hand , elliptical surface brightness contours were then fitted to the cleaned images , using the stsdas package isophote , outwards to the radius at which the fitting fails to converge , and inwards to the seeing limit .",
    "this process yields the azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profile as well as the variation with semi - major axis of the ellipse centroid , its position angle and ellipticity ; these ellipses are then used later as the apertures for the photometric extraction and allows for the interpolation of masked regions .",
    "the disk portion of the surface brightness profile is then fit by a linear function , using an interactive procedure that allows specification of the inner and outer disk radii , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : sb110482 ] to [ fig : sb212824 ] illustrate examples of the isophotal fitting result for four representative cases . selected sdss and galex images of them are shown in figure [ fig : img ] .",
    "figure [ fig : sb110482 ] shows the result for agc  110482 = kk  13 , a patchy dwarf galaxy whose fuv flux is dominated by two bright knots .",
    "the galphot isophotes are centered on the brighter knot in the inner region but the ellipse fitting treats the merged light from the two knots as a single disk at large radius .",
    "this process results in a second peak in the surface brightness profile , when the ellipses reach the center of the fainter knot , but at large radii , the surface brightness profile falls exponentially as expected , yielding a valid total magnitude .",
    "this process of fitting the disk assumes that the surface brightness profile of dwarf irregulars follows an exponential falloff @xcite so that disk scale lengths can be determined .",
    "however , dwarfs sometimes show multiple disk components , with clearly different slopes in inner and outer regions . in such cases ,",
    "we fit two linear functions to each portion individually , and use the inner fit to determine the general disk properties , e.g. scale length , position angle , etc , whereas the outer fit is used to extrapolate the surface brightness profile beyond the outermost measured isophote . among the 130 alfalfa dwarfs observed in galex ( 12 with no fuv exposure ) , 28 have such double disks .",
    "the majority of those ( 20/28 ) have shallower outer disks in the nuv ( e.g. agc  122212 in figure [ fig : sb122212 ] and its images in figure [ fig : img ] ) , but 15/20 of them show no outer disk in the fuv ( e.g. agc  213796 in figure [ fig : sb213796 ] and images in figure [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "of the 8 blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) studied by @xcite , 5 also have nuv double exponentials , all of which drop more shallowly in the outer disk .",
    "those authors argue that the shallower outer profile represents the underlying stellar population , while the steeper inner profile is dominated by the centrally concentrated and intense recent star formation .",
    "consistent with this interpretation , the shallow outer disks are frequently not in evidence in the fuv .",
    "further evidence for this scenario arises from the fact that the disk scale length is smaller in the fuv band compared to that seen in the nuv , again suggesting that recent star formation is more centrally concentrated than is the overall stellar disk , i.e. , the active star - forming region is shrinking .",
    "on the other hand , of the 29 dwarf irregulars studied by @xcite , eight have clear double exponential profiles in the nuv ; in only one of those is the outer exponential shallower than the inner one .",
    "similarly , most of the alfalfa dwarfs with steeper outer disks ( 7/8 ) belong to the higher @xmath68 _ s - sup _ sample ; it is possible that some may be more massive galaxies with more extinction in the inner regions .",
    "an example of this case is shown in figure [ fig : sb212824 ] for agc  212824 = kk  100 ( see its images in figure [ fig : img ] ) which has the highest @xmath68 in our sample .",
    "another possible explanation for the apparent flattening of the uv profile was proposed in @xcite , namely that the sfr in the inner disk has been higher than the infall of the gas , leading to a progressive consumption of gas towards the center . in the outer parts however , star formation is less efficient , and the infall of gas proceeds on longer timescales . as a result , the gas reservoir of the outer disk is not exhausted , and the shape of the exponential profile is preserved",
    ". the steeper outer disk may thus be more evident in the gas rich dwarf irregulars , while the lower @xmath68 _ s - com _ dwarfs which are gas - poor relative to the overall alfalfa population ( see  [ fgas ] ) frequently show flatter outer uv profiles .",
    "once ellipses are fit , magnitudes are calculated using the iraf routine polyphot to measure the total flux within the ellipses and the disk fits are used to extrapolate beyond the measured isophotes . following @xcite ,",
    "several sets of magnitudes are recorded , including ones at fixed isophotal levels , partial magnitudes integrated to a certain number of disk scale lengths , and asymptotic magnitudes extrapolated to infinity .",
    "the extrapolation helps to recover the lsb outer emission below the sky level . while magnitudes extrapolated to infinity",
    "are adopted by the 11hugs studies @xcite , we follow the discussion in @xcite and adopt in this work a total magnitude computed at a radius of eight disk scale lengths 8@xmath78 .",
    "note that for the majority of the galaxies , a radial extent of 8@xmath78 lies beyond the outermost radii marked as defining the disk region , except in a few cases that the uv emission is compact and the image is particularly deep ( e.g. agc  225852 in the nuv and agc  220609 in the fuv ) . to determine the error in the total magnitude , following @xcite",
    ", we add the zero - point calibration errors of 0.052 ( fuv ) and 0.026 ( nuv ) mags to the poisson errors , and the uncertainty in the determination of the sky level , which is formally the rms noise of the pixel values in the sky boxes after masking the sources contained within them .",
    "we do not account for other types of errors , e.g. the flat - fielding errors , which are improved in the products of the latest version of the galex pipeline ( gr6 ) .",
    "because of their extreme lsb in the uv , two galaxies , agc  201970 = leg  18 and agc  223913 = vcc  1649 ( see its images in figure [ fig : img ] ) , fail to produce convergence of fitted isophotal ellipses .",
    "the former one is also lsb in the sdss images , but agc  223913 , a de / dsph in virgo , is only faint in the uv ( see  [ cmd ] for more discussion ) .",
    "for these two objects , the galex pipeline extracts a handful of unmatched faint sources in the nuv and fuv at the location of the target galaxy . we assign concentric elliptical apertures with increasing semi - major axis by hand to extract a curve of growth and adopt their magnitudes from those measured in the outermost aperture .    only one galaxy ,",
    "agc  220483 = vcc  628 is too faint in the fuv to yield a reliable magnitude ; it is also undetected by the galex pipeline to a limiting magnitude @xmath1022.7 mag .",
    "it is a dwarf irregular ( i m ) associated with the virgo b cluster but moving at very high velocity ; it exhibits lsb also at optical wavelengths .",
    "it remains the lone object in our sample of alfalfa dwarfs with mis - depth galex fuv imaging to exhibit no traceable fuv emission .",
    "a comparison between our galphot / elphot - derived magnitudes and the galex pipeline magnitudes ( gr6 ) is shown in the upper row of figure [ fig : plotuvmag ] for the nuv ( left ) and fuv ( right ) channels respectively .",
    "the magnitude difference is defined as ( mag@xmath79-mag@xmath80 ) . filled and",
    "open circles denote the galaxies in the _ s - com _ and _ s - sup _ samples respectively .",
    "in addition to agc  220483 = vcc  628 , which was not detected in the fuv as discussed above , several galaxies are excluded from these plots because they were not detected by the galex pipeline in either one band or the other : agc  205097 in the nuv ( 2 nuv - bright stars are nearby ) , agc  112505 in the nuv ( blend with 1 nearby nuv - bright star and also very close to ugc  1176 = ddo  13 ) , agc  223913 in the fuv (= vcc  1649 , de in virgo , lsb in the nuv , invisible in the fuv by eye ; sdss and galex images shown in figure [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "in addition to these non - detections , several clear outliers are seen in figure [ fig : plotuvmag ] .",
    "the outliers in the fuv plot have a brighter magnitude obtained by the ` galphot ' ellipse fitting than that measured by the galex pipeline .",
    "close inspection shows that they are mostly extended irregulars with large disk scale lengths and patchy uv emission ; they suffer from significant shredding by the galex pipeline , e.g. ugc  4415 and agc  122206 in the nuv ; agc  200512 in the fuv ( sdss and galex images are shown in figure [ fig : img ] ) ; agc  201970 in both the nuv and fuv .",
    "several galaxies lie at such nearby distances that they have resolved hii regions visible in the fuv ( e.g. ugc  12613 with a distance of only 0.9 mpc ; ugc  5373 = sextans b at 1.3 mpc ) . after excluding the non - detections and outliers which arise from blending or shredding by the pipeline process , the magnitudes we derive are in reasonable agreement with the pipeline magnitudes .",
    "the improved gr6 pipeline magnitudes agree better with our results , especially in the nuv .",
    "the bottom row of figure [ fig : plotuvmag ] shows the same magnitude difference versus the disk scale length r@xmath81 on a logarithmic scale . as evident in figure [ fig : plotuvmag ] , our photometric extraction technique , which is specifically designed to capture all of the low surface brightness flux , yields brighter magnitudes for a significant number of galaxies .",
    "the median magnitude difference is @xmath82 and @xmath83 mag in the nuv and fuv , respectively .",
    "a weak trend is seen such that , as the galaxies become more extended ( larger r@xmath81 ) , the galex pipeline misses the outer lsb uv emission and hence underestimates the true uv magnitude . for the remainder of this work , we use our own measurements of galex uv magnitudes ,",
    "denoted as @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "in addition to the uv photometry from galex , we use optical data from the sdss data release 7 @xcite .",
    "the sdss database provides photometry in five bands ( @xmath86 ) and spectroscopic follow - up for most galaxies with @xmath87 . for the present work , we use the sdss archival measurements to derive the properties of the underlying stellar population , but because of issues of shredding and blending similar to those found with the galex magnitudes , significant caution is applied .",
    "given the higher resolution of the sdss imaging and the higher density of bright stars , the problems associated with magnitude estimation are worse in the optical than in the uv .",
    "to check for such issues , we inspected visually each galaxy and the magnitudes derived from the sdss pipeline , and adopted the photometric properties associated with the best photometric crossmatch along with its reported quality code , sflag ( see below ) .",
    "as suggested by the sdss team , _ modelmag _ magnitudes are adopted to derive stable colors while still capturing most of the total light .    of the 229 galaxies in the _ s - com _ and",
    "_ s - sup _ samples , 24 lie outside of the sdss legacy survey footprint ; most of these are found in the fall sky region of alfalfa ( @xmath88 r.a.@xmath89 , @xmath21 dec .",
    "@xmath22 ) .",
    "it is well known that the sdss photometric pipeline is optimized for small , high surface brightness objects @xcite , not the clumpy and lsb dwarf galaxies typical of our sample .",
    "in fact , of the 205 alfalfa dwarfs in the sdss sample , only 44 alfalfa dwarfs are extracted as single photometric objects by the sdss pipeline ( sflag=``oly '' as given in column 8 of table [ table : dwarf ] ) . since",
    "multiple peaks are usually evident in the light profiles of patchy dwarfs ( the `` parent '' object ) , these are often de - blended by the standard pipeline into pieces ( the `` child '' objects ) .",
    "accurate magnitudes can be recovered in those cases where the `` parent '' object contains all ( or nearly all ) of the emission associated with the galaxy and is not blended with any other nearby objects .",
    "53 of the alfalfa dwarfs belong to this category ( sflag=``par '' ) ; in these cases , the magnitudes of the associated _ parentid _ are adopted .",
    "for the remaining objects for which the `` parent '' objects still suffer from blending , we examined the magnitudes of each `` child '' object within the region of the target galaxy . according to @xcite ,",
    "roughly 75% of galaxies have more than 90% of their flux contained in the brightest child .",
    "we used the magnitudes of the brightest child where it is brighter than the second brightest child by at least 3 magnitudes , implying that it contains the vast majority of the galaxy s flux .",
    "55 of the 205 alfalfa - sdss dwarfs fit this category ( sflag=``domi '' ) so that the sdss magnitudes contribute a satisfactory lower limit of the optical flux .",
    "the remaining 53 galaxies have photometry too uncertain to be used further , usually because the parent object is blended with other sources or has no dominant child ( sflag=``pbphot '' ) .",
    "it is relevant to note that most are dropped for one of two specific reasons : either ( 1 ) because they are very patchy or ( 2 ) because they are contaminated by the presence of nearby or superposed stars .",
    "the latter reason has nothing to do with the galaxy itself , but the first is particularly common for this sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we checked the distribution of hi properties for the excluded objects , and find that they span the full range in distance , line width , and hi mass evident in figure [ fig : sample5 ] , suggesting that the inclusion of a criterion of acceptable sdss photometry introduces no extra bias in terms of hi parameters .",
    "although we have not reprocessed the sdss photometry as did @xcite , the careful visual inspection technique applied here effectively avoids the shredding or blending of the sdss magnitudes which are the main causes of the failure of the sdss pipeline to deliver reliable photometry for diffuse , patchy and/or lsb galaxies .",
    "however , because of the typical faintness and lsb optical appearance of the alfalfa dwarfs , the percentage of the photometric objects that are targeted for sdss spectroscopy is quite low : only 114/205 have a counterpart in the sdss spectroscopic survey .",
    "this circumstance further validates the importance of hi - selection for deriving a complete sample of dwarfs in the local universe .",
    "furthermore , only 101 of the 114 spectroscopic targets are included in the mpa - jhu dr7 release of sdss spectral measurements ( http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr7/ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which contains reprocessed line flux , etc .",
    "we confirm that all these 101 dwarfs are star - forming or low s / n star forming galaxies , following the classification in @xcite . in comparison with the sdss - selected population , the hi - selected dwarf sample includes a much smaller representation of galaxies containing agns or are classified as ` non - star - forming ' ; this finding also implies that the sdss magnitudes are more likely to be contaminated by line emission .",
    "similarly , a quick inspection shows that all the alfalfa dwarf galaxies with sdss @xmath90 measurements have a value below 1.6 , the demarcation in the bimodal distribution derived in @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that these dwarfs have been actively forming stars throughout their history .",
    "the global color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is a powerful tool for the assessment of the basic properties of a sample of galaxies .",
    "the bimodal nature of the field galaxy cmd is well demonstrated with the large datasets available from recent large scale galaxy surveys , in particular sdss @xcite . it is clear that galaxies separate into the ` red sequence ' of early type galaxies which show little or no evidence of ongoing star formation ( corresponding to the low ssfr portion in the ssfr versus @xmath3 diagram ) , and the ` blue cloud ' of star - forming spirals ( corresponding to the star forming sequence in that diagram ) . compared to the traditional optically - based cmds",
    ", a cmd constructed from a uv - to - optical color provides a more powerful diagnostic @xcite . by contrasting the recent star formation , as indicated by the uv light , to the total past star formation , as indicated by the optical light ,",
    "the uv to optical color provides a more concrete diagnostic of a galaxy s sfh @xcite .    to produce the cmd shown in figure [ fig : cmd ] ,",
    "the magnitudes given in table [ table : dwarf ] have been corrected for foreground reddening . for the sdss bands",
    ", we adopted the pipeline extinction correction .",
    "for the galex bands , we used @xmath91 values based on the fir dirbe maps of @xcite , the @xcite extinction law with @xmath92 , and @xmath93 for the fuv and 8.2 for the nuv bands respectively , following @xcite .",
    "of the 229 galaxies listed in table [ table : dwarf ] , 51 belonging to the complete _ s - com _ sample and 32 to the higher @xmath68 supplementary _ s - sup _ set have both acceptable sdss photometry ( sflag not `` pbphot '' ) and nuv magnitudes , making it possible to estimate a color ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "their distribution in the combined uv - optical cmd is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : cmd ] , with filled circles denoting objects in the _ s - com _ sample and open ones representing the additional _ s - sup _ galaxies .",
    "the first obvious difference of this work from most previous studies is the much fainter absolute magnitude range probed by the alfalfa dwarfs .",
    "for example , as clear from figure 1 of @xcite , the majority of galaxies in that study have @xmath95 , whereas nearly all of the alfalfa dwarfs are less luminous than @xmath96 , with the mean @xmath97 .",
    "secondly , hi selection results in no obvious color bimodality in dwarfs , because nearly all hi - bearing galaxies are blue , actively star - forming systems ; hi selection is highly biased against the red sequence @xcite .",
    "based on the distribution of their full galex - sdss matched catalog , @xcite identified blue cloud galaxies as those with @xmath98 . given the color - magnitude relation , fainter galaxies are bluer on average and the dividing criterion shifts to @xmath99 at @xmath100 , according to figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "as evident in figure [ fig : cmd ] , virtually all the alfalfa dwarf galaxies are below the division of @xmath101 .",
    "only three objects , ugc  6245 , agc  223913 = vcc  1649 and agc  222297 = vcc  180 ( the latter two early type galaxies associated with the virgo cluster ) have @xmath102 , lying in the green valley or blue edge of the red sequence . at fixed @xmath103 ,",
    "galaxies with lower @xmath68 ( the filled circles ) have , on average , redder colors , indicating that they also exhibit a lower gas fraction ( @xmath104 , defined as @xmath105 throughout this work ) ; this trend confirms the general association of lower @xmath104 and redder color ( see also  [ fgas ] ) . as a result ,",
    "in the range of @xmath106 , a population of extremely low gas fraction de / dsph would have @xmath68 lower than the detection limit of alfalfa ; they would sit on the red sequence in this low luminosity range , but are not included in this sample .",
    "this point is further discussed in the case of the virgo cluster by @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a trend for lower luminosity objects to have bluer colors , as is also found in studies of large samples of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "as is the case with the full alfalfa sample @xcite , the cmd shown in figure [ fig : cmd ] confirms that , in comparison with large optical - uv samples , an hi - selected dwarf sample is highly biased against red sequence galaxies .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : cmd ] presents a color - color plot , with the horizontal axis showing the optical color @xmath107 .",
    "not surprisingly , there is a strong correlation such that as a galaxy becomes redder in @xmath108 , it also becomes redder in @xmath59 .",
    "as found by @xcite for blue galaxies , the two colors are very well correlated with a slope of @xmath109 ; this slope is roughly consistent for the alfalfa dwarf sample .",
    "those authors also found that , for galaxies with colors redder than @xmath110 , the @xmath59 color begins to increase less quickly with @xmath108 than for bluer @xmath59 colors .",
    "the alfalfa sample shows no obvious change in slope , as expected since most lie on the blue side of the division .",
    "we also examine the @xmath111 color , a sensitive probe of the rate of current star formation .",
    "there are 117 galaxies ( 69 belonging to the complete _ s - com _ sample and 48 to the supplementary _ s - sup _ one ) which have detectable magnitudes in both the fuv and the nuv . as described in @xcite , late - type spiral and irregular ` blue - cloud ' galaxies can be roughly separated from early - type ` red - sequence ' galaxies using a division at @xmath112 .",
    "according to that demarcation , 92% of our galaxies fall on the blue side .",
    "72% of the combined ( _ s - com _ plus _ s - sup _ ) sample have @xmath113 ; among the lower hi mass _ s - com _ galaxies , this percentage drops to 64% .",
    "furthermore , the median uv color is 0.36 mag for the _ s - com _ plus _ s - sup _ galaxies ( 0.42 mag for the _ s - com _ and 0.31 mag for the _ s - sup _ galaxies ) .",
    "evaluation of the k - s statistic shows that the probability that the uv color distributions of the two samples ( _ s - com _ vs. _ s - sup _ ) are drawn from the same underlying distribution is only 2.6% .",
    "the galaxies with the lowest hi mass ( _ s - com _ ) are _ redder _ than comparable galaxies with higher hi masses , that is , the hi mass cutoff imposed on the _ s - com _ results in a sample with redder uv colors on average at _ fixed optical luminosity _",
    "( see also  [ fgas ] ) .",
    "in comparison , the sample studied by @xcite , mainly drawn from the 11hugs , has 79% of the galaxies with @xmath113 , and a median uv color of 0.29 mag , bluer than the alfalfa dwarf galaxies , especially the _ s - com _ ones .",
    "figure [ fig : absmag ] examines more closely the distribution of absolute magnitude @xmath114 for the alfalfa dwarf and 11hugs samples .",
    "the solid histograms trace the distribution of the 152 alfalfa dwarfs with acceptable sdss magnitudes ( see  [ sdssdata ] ) , with the shaded area identifying the complete _ s - com _ sample and the open area , the _ s - sup _ galaxies . to convert the sdss bands to @xmath115-band , the transformation equation derived by lupton ( 2005 ) is used , @xmath116 . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed histogram represents the parent 11hugs sample with their @xmath115-band absolute magnitudes drawn from table 3 of @xcite .",
    "although the alfalfa _ s - com _ sample extends to considerably lower hi mass , the faintest optical magnitudes probed by both alfalfa and 11hugs are similar .",
    "relative to the 11hugs galaxies , the lower gas fractions typical of the _ s - com _ dwarfs are consistent with their redder colors .",
    "one of the alfalfa dwarfs , agc  223913 = vcc  1649 ( see its images in figure [ fig : img ] ) even has @xmath117 , implying that it is in a quiescent stage of star - formation .",
    "it is a de / dsph in virgo , whose red uv color could result from a recent quenching of star formation activity , possibly due to gas loss by ram pressure stripping ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this object and the other early type dwarfs detected by alfalfa in the virgo cluster are discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in this section , we use the datasets discussed above to derive the physical properties of the alfalfa dwarf galaxies ( _ s - sed _ ) : their stellar masses , internal extinction , metallicity and sfr .      while studies of resolved stellar populations provide the best means to determine the star formation histories of galaxies , it is not yet feasible to conduct such studies on the majority of the alfalfa dwarfs . hence we analyze their integrated light and global properties by sed fitting , following the method of @xcite , with a slight change in the prior distribution of the effective optical depth in v band , @xmath118 ( see  [ afuv ] ) . of the full alfalfa dwarf sample , reprocessed fuv and nuv magnitudes and acceptable quality sdss pipeline photometry as described above are available for a total of 74 galaxies , 45 belonging to the more restrictive _",
    "s - com _ sample and 29 to the additional _ s - sup _ set .",
    "the full likelihood distributions of parameters are derived for this combined sample , referred to hereafter as _ s - sed _ , by fitting the seven observed sdss ( @xmath119 ) and galex ( @xmath120 ) bands to an extensive library of model seds @xcite , generated using the b&c 03 stellar population synthesis code @xcite .",
    "dust is accounted for with the @xcite two - component model to include attenuation from both the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) and short - lived ( 10myr ) giant molecular clouds .",
    "it is proposed to produces consistent treatment for both the h@xmath11 and uv continuum attenuation .",
    "however , we do note that recent studies show that the extinction curve may be a function of stellar mass , ssfr , axis ratio and stellar surface mass density , etc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a @xcite imf is assumed , and random bursts are allowed to be superimposed on a continuous sfh .    a concern for the study of hi - selected galaxies is whether the parameter space used for building the library is set wide enough to cover the intrinsic values of the metal- and dust - poor alfalfa dwarfs .",
    "for example , following @xcite , the effective @xmath121-band optical depth lies in the range @xmath122 , and the @xmath123 factor , i.e. , the fraction of the optical depth that affects stellar populations older than 10 myr , varies from 0.1 to 1 . a commonly - used prescription by @xcite adopts @xmath124 ( see also discussion in  [ afuv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the metallicity of the stellar population is uniformly distributed between 0.1 and 2 @xmath125 .",
    "in particular , we can anticipate that in some cases , the emission lines may be so strong that the observed colors may deviate from the adopted line - free continuum model @xcite , e.g. the h@xmath11 emission may dominate the @xmath52-band luminosity to offset the observed @xmath126 color bluewards of the models .",
    "however , outliers affected by line emission can be identified in a color - color plot , e.g. @xmath126 versus @xmath127 . as a result",
    ", the @xmath128-value of the best - fitting model , @xmath129 , would have a mean larger than that predicted by the degree of freedom of the fitting .",
    "we checked the distribution of @xmath129 and found it is generally good , implying that the library does , in fact , reproduce most of the observed seds .",
    "however , there is a tail of large @xmath129 objects , and we confirm by visual inspection that their deviation is likely caused by strong line emission ( e.g. agc  220856 = vcc  1744 and agc  223390 = vcc  274 , two virgo bcds ; the sdss and galex images of the former are included in figure [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "additionally , although we already excluded the `` shredded '' sources , there remain a few objects with suspicious sdss magnitudes , e.g. agc  205165 ( problematic de - blending of a superposed star ) , agc  191791 = lsbc d634 - 03 ( unusual color in the sdss image ) , which also lead to large @xmath129 . for these reasons",
    ", we emphasize that the sed fitting results should be interpreted only in a statistical sense , with these large @xmath129 objects being less reliable .",
    "the galaxies with @xmath130 are noted by a ` * ' over the agc numbers in table [ table : dwarf ] .",
    "compared to sed fitting to the optical sdss bands only , fitting with the addition of the galex uv bands yields better constraints on the parameters , especially on the dust optical depth and the sfr over a timescale of 100 myr , comparable to the lifetime of uv bright stars @xcite .",
    "we use the likelihood - weighted average as our nominal estimate of the logarithm of the parameter value , rather than the mode , to avoid sensitivity to binning , and @xmath131 of the 2.5 - 97.5 percentile range as a proxy for what would have been the uncertainty estimate in the gaussian distribution @xcite . an extra term which accounts for distance uncertainties",
    "is added for distance - dependent quantities , e.g. the stellar mass and sfr .",
    "this term always dominates the sed fitting error ( characterized by the probability distribution function , pdf ) for the nearby dwarfs in the stellar mass estimates , but not for the errors in the sfrs . note that systematic uncertainty is not included in the error estimate .",
    "when the uv bands are excluded , the median uncertainty in the @xmath132 estimate is 0.217 ; in @xmath133 , it is 0.455 ; in @xmath134 , it is 0.323 .",
    "when the uv data are incorporated , those values decrease to 0.212 , 0.367 , 0.277 , corresponding to median improvement of 1% , 21% and 7% respectively . while the constraint on the stellar mass is least improved",
    ", the incorporation of the uv data is critical to the other parameters , both of which are more sensitive to changes in the uv luminosity .",
    "based on the sed fitting error term characterized by the pdf , the @xmath3 is the best constrained parameter in the sed fitting .",
    "the logarithm of @xmath3 , in units of solar mass , is listed in column ( 11 ) of table [ table : dwarf ] .",
    "@xmath135= 7.40 for the _ s - sed _ dwarfs ( 7.28 for the lower hi mass _ s - com _ galaxies and 7.58 for the additional _ s - sup _ objects ) , significantly lower than those of typical sdss or galex samples @xcite .",
    "this result further confirms that the imposition of an hi line width cutoff effectively eliminates most of the hi deficient but high luminosity objects .",
    "the only two galaxies with @xmath136 are ugc  6245 , a low luminosity sb0 galaxy viewed almost face - on so that its true velocity width may be much larger , and ugc  7889 (= ngc  4641 ) , a bcd in virgo .",
    "the former has the highest stellar mass @xmath137 and a low gas fraction , but is left in the _ s - sup _ sample because of the availability of its galex image from our gi program ( see  [ sample ] ) .",
    "another widely used method to estimate the stellar mass from optical magnitudes employs the relation of mass to light ratio versus color as calibrated by @xcite .",
    "however , the sfh adopted by @xcite does not fully account for the impact of the bursty behavior seen in nearby dwarfs @xcite .",
    "gas - rich dwarfs have @xmath138-parameters ( @xmath139 , the current sfrs normalized to the average past sfrs ) which are high on average ( see  [ sfs ] ) . as a result ,",

    "therefore , following @xcite , we also calculate the stellar mass using the @xmath142 band luminosity and the @xmath127 color .",
    "we apply k - corrections using the idl code `` kcorrect '' ( @xmath143 ) , described in @xcite and estimate internal extinction corrections based on equation ( 12 ) in @xcite .",
    "the latter has little effect on the stellar mass estimate , since when the luminosity is increased , the color also becomes bluer by an associated amount such that the two effects cancel each other @xcite .",
    "the two stellar mass estimates , i.e. , that derived from @xcite calibration versus that derived from sed fitting , agree for the most massive galaxies with @xmath144 and low @xmath138-parameters , but systematic deviations between the two become non - negligible at the low mass end . while the @xcite method gives a median @xmath132=7.73 for the _ s - sed _",
    "alfalfa dwarfs ( converted to chabrier imf ) , sed fitting yields a considerably lower median of 7.45 corresponding to a factor of two difference . furthermore , because the most gas rich galaxies ( i.e. higher @xmath68 for their @xmath3 ) with higher @xmath138-parameters in this stellar mass range are excluded from the dwarf sample in this work ( see  [ sfgas ] ) , the deviation is even larger among the full low stellar mass alfalfa population @xcite .",
    "we find a discrepancy of similar magnitude to that found by @xcite , @xmath100.4 dex on average at @xmath145 , and we confirm that the galaxies which are estimated to be more massive by the @xcite method have generally higher @xmath138-parameters .",
    "to incorporate reasonably the effects of stochastic star formation , bursty behavior in dwarf galaxies should be a key feature of modeling the seds .",
    "although the fuv luminosity provides a more robust estimate of the recent sfr in dwarf galaxies than optical measures , it is subject to significant uncertainties because of the required dust attenuation corrections which themselves are subject to large scatter produced by the large range of possible dust content , dust distribution , and geometry relative to the stars and ism in galaxies . even at @xmath146 ,",

    "based on that assumption , they found a lower average @xmath8 for the figgs dwarfs than would be expected from the kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite took @xmath150 and @xcite found @xmath151 for the faintest galaxies . here , rather than ignoring extinction ,",

    "given the possible degeneracy of its red color arising from either high extinction or strong sf quenching in the virgo environment , it is probable that the large extinction implied by the sed fitting for this galaxy is unreliable .",
    "another approach which we suggest is relevant here anticipates that extinction should be lower in less luminous and face - on systems with low metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that the derived @xmath153 is sensitive to the assumed prior distribution of @xmath118 in the model library . therefore",
    ", to constrain better @xmath153 , we first try to estimate @xmath118 , following @xcite , and trim out the models with unrealistically high extinctions . with this improvement in the sed fitting , the mean values for the alfalfa dwarf _",

    "since the @xmath157 estimates are reduced by 0.14 mag on average , the @xmath134 is reduced correspondingly by 0.06  dex ( see values in  [ sfr ] ) . as noted previously (  [ smass ] )",

    "[ hiprop ] , it is unlikely that we are missing edge - on dwarfs because of the line - width cutoff . rather , the observed",
    "distribution implies that dwarf galaxies are intrinsically thicker or that the distribution of sf sites within them are quite irregular , making the tracing of their disks more complicated .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggested that dust reddening is not so sensitive to axial ratio at low metallicity as at high metallicity .",
    "we have also looked for trends in @xmath157 with @xmath3 and @xmath104 .",
    "the trend seen by @xcite that attenuation increases with stellar mass , is not evident among the alfalfa dwarf galaxies ; the latter of course include no really massive galaxies .",
    "however , in comparison with figure 2 of @xcite , we find that the highest value of @xmath157 reached by gas - rich galaxies ( as identified by high @xmath104 ) is lower than that estimated for relatively gas - poor galaxies .",
    "such a result is reasonable assuming that the galaxies which are gas - rich for their stellar masses are less evolved , have lower dust content and metallicity , and thus exhibit less attenuation .",
    "other common approaches to estimating extinction exploit the infrared wavelengths . in this case however , the spitzer archive contains too few of the alfalfa dwarfs to permit a direct measurement of the infrared excess ( irx ) incorporating mips wavelengths .",
    "instead we examine how @xmath157 varies with uv color ( @xmath140 ) , equivalent to the @xmath159 relation following @xcite . in comparison with the relation given for normal star - forming galaxies by those authors ,",
    "the alfalfa dwarfs only marginally follow the trend , with the more massive _",
    "s - sup _ members showing less scatter about the relation . a number of the lowest hi mass _ s - com",
    "_ galaxies fall below the relation for normal galaxy samples ; their @xmath157 would thus be over - predicted by the standard @xmath159 relation given their uv color , possibly because of their different sfh and/or dust geometry .",
    "we also find that @xmath157 is better correlated with the @xmath111 color than with the @xmath108 color .",
    "in addition , we use the the spectroscopic balmer lines to compare the observed flux ratios in the h@xmath11 to h@xmath140 lines with the theoretical value ( 2.86 for case b recombination ) to estimate @xmath166 .",
    "we assume that @xmath167 , following the calzetti law @xcite , with the caveats about large variations in uv extinction curves and aperture effects .",
    "we approximate the ratios using the line flux measurements from the mpa - jhu dr7 catalog ( see  [ sdssdata ] ) .",
    "this method is applied to 42 galaxies which are common to both the _ s - sed _ sample and the mpa - jhu catalog .",
    "surprisingly , this crude application of the balmer decrement method gives systematically smaller extinction estimates , with a mean @xmath157 = 0.64 mag when we adopt the calzetti law .",
    "given that the @xmath157 values are presumably dominated by attenuation by the diffuse ism whereas the emission lines probe the local attenuation within the clouds in which they originate , one might expect the opposite result as is found in massive galaxies @xcite , and incorporated into the factor of 1.8 between the fuv and h@xmath11 extinctions .",
    "however , we note that @xcite also found a strong decrease in emission line - to - continuum attenuation ratio with increasing ssfr , in agreement with the overall high ssfrs of the alfalfa dwarf sample relative to the massive galaxies ( see  [ sfs ] ) and likely indicative of the variation of the dust geometry with the ssfr .",
    "furthermore , there is large uncertainty in the uv extinction curve so that the constant in the @xmath167 relation suffers from large uncertainty and is most likely underestimated . for the low stellar surface mass density galaxies ( @xmath168 ) with @xmath169 , @xcite found 0.3 mag more attenuation in the nuv compared to the calzetti law which is derived for starburst galaxies .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a steeper dust extinction curve in ordinary star - forming galaxies than found in starburst galaxies by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the bump strength of the 2175   dust feature is known to vary . incorrectly assuming a dust curve with no 2175   feature ( e.g. the calzetti law for starburst galaxies ) would lead to an underestimate in the amount of dust , in turn leading to the incorrect conclusion that the stellar populations are extremely metal poor @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the steep fuv rise and small 2175   feature in dwarf galaxies , resembling the observed extinction curve of some regions in the lmc , may due to different dust grain properties in low mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a final approach , we have explored the extended @xmath160 relation based on the @xmath108 color and the @xmath90 measurement derived in @xcite , which is commonly used by local galex studies @xcite ; application of this relation to the alfalfa dwarfs predicts a much larger extinction @xmath157 in many of the lowest mass _ s - com _ galaxies .    at the end of this analysis of the various methods of estimating the internal extinction , we conclude that ( a ) sed - fitting using the uv continuum is the most reliable currently available tool to obtain @xmath157 values for the alfalfa dwarfs , but that ( b ) there is large uncertainty in the extinction estimates . it is inappropriate to ignore completely a correction for extinction at uv wavelengths (",
    "the mean of @xmath157 is 1.33 mag ) , although attenuation in the dwarfs is smaller than that found in more massive sdss galaxies , e.g. 2.03 mag in @xcite .",
    "we note that taking attenuation into account can bring the dwarf galaxies in the figgs study of @xcite closer to the kennicutt - schmidt star formation law obtained for more massive galaxies .",
    "however , it will not lead to a change in the slope of the relation . as was found by @xcite ,",
    "the relationship between the hi density and the sfr in gas - rich dwarfs is steeper than the kennicutt - schmidt star formation law .",
    "standard recipes used to convert fuv luminosities to sfrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are derived on the assumption of solar metallicity stellar populations , @xmath125 . however , in the general population of star - forming galaxies , the gas - phase metallicity @xmath170 of the ism is known to increase with stellar mass , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this dependence is consistent with simple closed - box models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereby high gas fraction galaxies are relatively unevolved and thus have experienced low metal enrichment . especially in low mass systems ,",
    "ism blow - out can follow episodic star formation events .",
    "the adoption of an incorrect @xmath170 to estimate the sfr through the observed fuv luminosity can significantly bias the result , as a relative deficiency of metals would result in higher temperatures in the photospheres of forming stars and thus in a greater number of uv photons produced per unit stellar mass .",
    "it is thus legitimate to question the validity of sfrs derived for low @xmath3 systems such as the alfalfa dwarfs , if an account for their presumed low @xmath170 is not considered .",
    "short of specific measurements through optical spectroscopy , the stellar population metallicity may be estimated via sed fitting . unlike other well constrained parameters such as @xmath3 however , @xmath170 is poorly constrained by sed fitting ; in fact deriving @xmath170 from sed fitting often yields a likelihood distribution with multiple peaks .",
    "while we would normally expect that the mean estimates of metallicity @xmath171 derived for larger samples are more reliable , we note that the @xcite sample yields @xmath172 , while for the alfalfa dwarf _ s - sed _ sample we obtain @xmath173 ( @xmath174 for the low hi mass _ s - com _ galaxies and @xmath175 for the additional _ s - sup _ ones ) .",
    "therefore , for our estimates of sfr , we adopt kennicutt s relation , with a correction of 1.1 as given by @xcite , appropriate for a salpeter imf and @xmath176 .",
    "the stellar population metallicity is correlated with gas - phase metallicity , though with large scatter @xcite .",
    "given the shallow potential well of dwarf galaxies , the gas - phase metal enrichment can be easily lost by outflow .",
    "oxygen abundance measures from the mpa - jhu dr7 release of sdss spectral @xcite is available for 58 alfalfa dwarf galaxies , with a mean of @xmath177 ( 8.27 for 44 low hi mass _ s - com _ members and 8.22 for 14 _ s - sup _ galaxies ) . the oxygen abundances can be converted to gas - phase metallicities in units of solar metallicity ( @xmath178 ) , adopting a value of @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "the mean of the gas - phase metallicity for the alfalfa dwarf galaxies corresponds to @xmath180 .",
    "however , according to the mass - metallicity relation derived in @xcite , based mainly on more massive galaxies @xmath181 , the stellar mass of @xmath182 corresponds to @xmath183 .",
    "almost all of the alfalfa dwarfs lie above this relation .      as a next step",

    "the alfalfa dwarfs overall show very low values of sfr .",
    "in such a regime where only a handful of o - stars are formed over timescales comparable to their lifetimes ( i.e. , a few million years ) , h@xmath11 emission will appear weak or even absent .",
    "the sfrs inferred from h@xmath11 deviate from those of fuv at @xmath191 , but such stochastic effects may begin to play a role below @xmath192 , according to @xcite .",
    "low mass stars may form continuously but at a very low rate so that no change in the imf is required .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that other factors , including internal dust attenuation , stellar model uncertainties , metallicity , ionizing photon loss and starbursts , if considered alone , are insufficient to explain the amplitude of the underestimate of the sfr derived from h@xmath11 relative to that implied by the uv luminosity .",
    "they also suggested that an imf deficient in high mass stars is consistent with their results .",

    "the relatively tight correlation evident here confirms that the stellar population synthesis model we used is consistent with what was used in @xcite .",

    "although we do not compare the @xmath184 with @xmath201 here , we note that this threshold is close to the critical value identified by @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that , since their sample is characterized by a wide variation in sfh , the conversion factor from fuv luminosity to sfr is smaller than that which would apply for a constant sfh . compared to their sample , the alfalfa dwarfs are currently forming more stars relative to the accumulated stellar masses ( see  [ sfs ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath138-parameters become systematically larger in dwarf systems , i.e. a higher fraction of their stars have been formed more recently .",
    "for the same amount of observed fuv luminosity , the sfrs averaged over 100 myr would be smaller than those derived if the sfrs had remained constant .",
    "if so , the standard @xcite conversion factor from @xmath70 to @xmath184 would be too large in the case of dwarf galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , a bursty sf behavior would have less impact on the @xmath201 , because the sfr is more likely to remain constant during the much shorter life times of o - stars .",
    "these results suggest not only that the @xmath201 values may be suspicious @xcite , but so also may be the estimates of @xmath184 derived using standard conversions obtained for samples of more typical and more massive galaxies .    at this point , we do not have available h@xmath11 images , but we can make a crude attempt to quantify the sfrs with the h@xmath202 line flux derived from the sdss spectra , @xmath201 , for those galaxies with such measures .",
    "we again use the standard conversion factor calibrated in @xcite , taking into account the metallicity and imf difference .",
    "the mpa - jhu reprocessed h@xmath11 line flux is corrected for attenuation , given by the balmer decrement as in  [ afuv ] .",
    "we correct for the aperture effect by using the ratio of the fluxes corresponding to the entire galaxy @xmath52-band magnitude and the magnitude through the fiber in the same band , following @xcite .",
    "the aperture correction implicitly assumes that the emission measured through the fiber is characteristic of the galaxy as a whole .",
    "however , in almost all of the alfalfa dwarfs the @xmath59 colors are bluer within the fiber than across the galaxy , a fact which can be explained if the bluest star - forming peaks in surface brightness are usually the targets of the spectroscopic observations . as a result ,",
    "our crude scaling by the @xmath52-band light should overestimate @xmath201 .",
    "however , the bottom panels in figure [ fig : sfrcom ] still show a systematic deficiency in @xmath201 , relative to both @xmath184 ( panel c ) and @xmath185 ( panel d ) , albeit with large scatter . as evident in panel ( c ) , the number of galaxies in the _ s - sed _ sample and with sdss spectra is quite limited . in panel ( d ) , we attempt to improve the statistics by dropping the requirement of uv data and thus calculating a @xmath185 by fitting only to the sdss bands .",
    "albeit crude , the best linear fit line to the data points ( the red dashed - dotted line ) has a slope larger than 1 , suggesting that while the @xmath184 could be an overestimate due to stochastic effects , we can not rule out the possible systematic deficiency of @xmath201 , compared to @xmath185 , and thus a non - universal imf .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining h@xmath11 images for this sample and plan to present a more comprehensive comparison of sfr measures in a future work .",
    "numerous previous works have explored the relationships between stars , star formation and gas in galaxies , and in this section , we explore how the alfalfa dwarf galaxies , specifically the _ s - sed _ sample galaxies , compare to others . in comparison with results obtained for large samples derived from the sdss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "besides the well - known correlation that the sfr increases with stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the ` star - forming sequence ' in a specific sfr ( @xmath5 ) versus stellar mass diagram is identified by the fact that the ssfrs of lower mass galaxies appear to be confined to a relatively narrow range of ssfr that declines as the stellar mass increases @xcite . at masses above @xmath203 ,",
    "some galaxies exhibit much lower values of the ssfr ; i.e. , the sequence turns over .",

    "in particular , the alfalfa _ s - sed _ dwarfs ( the circles and squares ) correspond to the systems of lowest stellar mass and define a low , broad tail of the sfr distribution . in the sfr versus @xmath59 color plot , while most of the alfalfa dwarfs lie on the blue branch , the colors remain almost unchanged despite their varying , but relatively small , sfrs .    as shown also by @xcite , the alfalfa catalog is clearly biased against red sequence galaxies .",
    "still , the bimodal nature of the distributions of ssfr is evident in the left panel of the second row of figure [ fig : sfs ] . at the high mass end , a relatively small population of red sequence @xmath33 galaxies occupies the low ssfr regime",
    "the contours of the blue star - forming sequence reflect the general trend that the ssfr generally decreases with increasing stellar mass . at the same time , compared to that in the intermediate mass range ( @xmath208 ) , the dispersion of the ssfr distribution in a given stellar mass bin increases below @xmath209 .",
    "the standard deviation of the @xmath210 distribution for galaxies in a given @xmath132 bin is 0.55  dex in @xmath211 , 0.71  dex in @xmath212 and increases to 0.83  dex in @xmath213 .",
    "most of the alfalfa dwarfs lie in this low stellar mass regime , and not surprisingly , they show a large dispersion in ssfr . moreover , because of the hi mass cutoff used to define the alfalfa dwarf sample , it actually includes galaxies with low hi mass for their stellar mass , e.g. , they are relatively gas - poor in comparison with the parent @xmath33-sdss sample ( see  [ fgas ] ) .",
    "this selection tends to exaggerate the dispersion of the ssfrs to low values , and a concentration of small grey points from the parent sample with higher ssfrs is visible above the _ s - sed _ galaxies within the same @xmath3 range . for the same reason , the additional _ s - sup _ galaxies with their higher gas fractions have higher ssfrs on average than the lower hi mass _ s - com _ ones .",
    "the few extreme outliers from the star - forming sequence with low ssfrs are mostly galaxies drawn from the lowest hi mass _ s - com _ sample ( filled circles and squares ) .",
    "several of them are des / dsphs in virgo ( e.g. agc  220819 = vcc  1617 and agc  223913 = vcc  1649 ; see images of the latter shown in figure [ fig : img ] ) , among the very few early type virgo dwarfs detected by alfalfa @xcite .    for galaxies with low ssfrs ,",
    "a blind hi survey is more efficient at the detection of galaxies at both the low and high stellar mass ends @xcite .",
    "moreover , a blind h@xmath11 survey would be biased against galaxies with low ssfrs .",
    "the sample analyzed by @xcite is heterogenous , making use of existing compilations of hi and h@xmath11 data derived for other purposes .",
    "for example , the local low ssfr galaxies with low @xmath3 were particularly targeted for the 11hugs program which contributes significantly to the h@xmath11 data used by @xcite .",
    "similarly , the hi data analyzed in @xcite includes a large population of massive cluster galaxies which have low ssfrs and were included in the targeted but deep surveys of nearby rich clusters @xcite .",
    "alfalfa probes to a slightly lower stellar mass range than the sample examined by @xcite and reveals outliers from star - forming sequence at both mass ends similar to those noticed by those authors .",
    "thus , the break - down of the star - forming sequence at the low mass end is real and indicates that the stellar mass is no longer the dominant regulator of sf in dwarfs .",
    "it is possible that dwarfs are more vulnerable to environmental effects so that their gas supply can be easily disturbed , and thus star formation quenched . in the intermediate @xmath3 range , many outliers with extremely low",
    "ssfrs exist within the @xmath33 parent sample , but their number density relative to the contoured region is so low that the dispersion of ssfrs remains low .",
    "however , while alfalfa reveals that outliers with anomalously low ssfr for their stellar mass exist at all masses , intermediate mass outliers are missing in similar plots ( e.g. figure 8) from @xcite . given the heterogenous sample which the @xcite analysis is based on , the absence of low ssfr galaxies in the intermediate mass range could be due to some combined bias in the sample selection criteria by the dual requirement of h@xmath11 and hi ( from the cornell digital hi archive , selected typically by luminosity , optical size and/or cluster membership ) measures .",
    "the contours in the ssfr versus @xmath59 diagram ( middle column ) show that the ssfrs of @xmath33 galaxies are tightly correlated with the @xmath59 color : for hi - selected galaxies nearly all of which are blue , the ssfrs , and thus the recent star - formation histories , are well constrained by the @xmath59 color itself .",
    "given the fact that the nuv band better traces star formation than the @xmath214-band , we would have expected that the @xmath108 color would be better correlated with ssfr than is the @xmath59 color .",
    "however , such an improvement is not obvious in the right panel : the larger attenuation correction introduces a greater dispersion in the observed nuv , so that a better correlation between ssfrs and @xmath108 colors is in fact not clearly evident among the _",
    "s - sed _ dwarf galaxies .",
    "finally , we consider another quantity related to the ssfr , namely , the birthrate or @xmath138-parameter , @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath217 is the fraction of the mass formed over the galaxy s lifetime that does not eventually get returned to the ism or igm @xcite .",
    "a typical value of @xmath217 is @xmath218 @xcite , and on the assumption that all galaxies started forming stars shortly after the big bang , @xmath219 gyr . for these choices of @xmath216 and @xmath217 , a galaxy with @xmath220 ,",
    "i.e. a constant sfr , would have a ssfr of @xmath221 yr @xmath2 .",
    "thus , galaxies with ssfrs larger than this value appear to have current sfrs above their lifetime average . with the caveat that sfr measures based on h@xmath11 emission in the low sfr regime may be systematically underestimated , @xcite found that only @xmath106% of low mass 11hugs galaxies are currently experiencing massive global bursts ( h@xmath11 ew above 100  @xmath71 or @xmath222 ) .",
    "here , we find that 13 galaxies ( 18% ) of the alfalfa _ s - sed _ sample have @xmath223 and 5 galaxies ( 7% ) even have @xmath224 . because of the relationship between the ssfr and the @xmath138-parameter ,",
    "the distributions of @xmath225 vs. stellar mass , @xmath59 and @xmath108 colors , shown in the bottom row of figure [ fig : sfs ] , resemble the corresponding distributions in the second row , suggesting that dwarfs have both higher ssfrs and @xmath138-parameters , on average , compared to higher mass galaxies . for this reason ,",
    "it is even more essential to take bursty behavior into account when modeling the seds of hi - selected dwarfs . at the same time , the equivalent widths of emission lines , e.g. h@xmath11 , which also characterize the ssfrs or @xmath138-parameters @xcite , could be large enough to modify the continuum emitted by the underlying stellar population , leading to large @xmath128 in the sed fitting (  [ sed ] ) . despite the caveats , the wide spread in @xmath138 values evident among the _ s - sed _ sample suggests that the sfhs of the alfalfa dwarfs are highly variable and no longer a strong function of @xmath3 .",
    "this result suggests further that other factors including environmental effects may play an important role in the regulation of star formation in hi - selected dwarfs .",
    "in addition to normalizing the sfrs by stellar mass to infer the level of the current sfr relative to its past average , we can also normalize the sfr by the hi mass to infer the ratio relative to potential future star formation , as inferred from the present amount of hi gas .",
    "following @xcite , we define the star formation efficiency as @xmath226 , and its reciprocal , as the gas consumption timescale @xmath227 , also known as the roberts time @xcite .",
    "observationally , low sfes have been measured for low - mass galaxies and lsb galaxies @xcite , and conversely , high efficiencies have been measured in starburst galaxies and interacting systems .    based on a sample of @xmath101000 local galaxies @xmath228 , with hi and h@xmath11 fluxes compiled from the literature , @xcite found that , with increasing luminosity , the hi gas fraction @xmath105 drops off faster than the h@xmath11-derived sfr , resulting in shorter @xmath229 for more luminous galaxies .",
    "those authors report @xmath229 in excess of several hubble times ( @xmath230 ) for samples of dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "in contrast , using the fuv luminosity instead of h@xmath11 to measure the sfr , @xcite found that dwarf galaxies may not be as drastically inefficient in converting gas into stars as suggested by h@xmath11 estimates , with sfes exceeding @xmath231 .",
    "although the @xcite sample also exploits hi measures for a large sample to derive gas fractions , it is based on optical , rather than hi , selection , deriving most of its hi properties from the extensive compilation of hi spectra contained in the cornell digital hi archive @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is important to note that more than @xmath232 of alfalfa hi detections are new and were not included in any of the extensive pointed observations which contributed to the digital archive dataset @xcite . in terms of the availability of hi measures , the @xmath33 parent sample is more homogeneous and its size is more than 10 times larger than the @xcite sample .",
    "moreover , we rely on sed fitting to derive physical quantities , rather than deriving stellar masses based on the @xmath233 versus color relation ( see  [ smass ] ) , or the h@xmath11 luminosity for the sfr ( see  [ sfr ] ) . in addition",
    ", the alfalfa dwarf population used here extends to lower hi masses compared to those in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the alfalfa - based galaxy sample is more comprehensive than either of those two previous studies both in terms of probing the general trends exhibited by hi - selected galaxies as well as exploring the behavior of the lowest mass dwarfs .",
    "figure [ fig : sfe ] shows the distribution of @xmath234 versus @xmath3 , @xmath59 and @xmath108 colors for the alfalfa samples . contours and grey small points in the left two panels depict the distribution of the full @xmath33-sdss dataset , and the symbol definition follows the same convention as in figure [ fig : sfs ] .",
    "the superposed dash - dotted line corresponds to @xmath235 .",
    "three main conclusions can be drawn from the general distribution .",
    "first , as discussed more fully elsewhere @xcite , alfalfa galaxies have , on average , higher sfrs but lower sfes than optically - selected ones , due to their higher than average hi masses . at the same time , the sfes are barely dependent on either the @xmath59 or @xmath108 color as shown in the center and right panels of figure [ fig : sfe ] .",
    "secondly , although the variation in the average sfr is mild across the stellar mass range of @xmath236 ( @xmath237 dex ) , the averaged sfe in each stellar mass bin increases with stellar mass . at the low mass end , the @xmath238 , albeit with considerable scatter .",
    "thirdly , a population of galaxies with very low sfe , arising mainly because of their low sfr ( see figure [ fig : sfs ] ) , stands distinct from the general distribution at the high mass end ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "notably , despite the fact that they are selected to have the lowest hi masses in the @xmath33 catalog , the _ s - sed _ dwarfs ( circles and squares ) typically have higher sfes regardless of their low sfrs , compared to an extrapolation of the general trend into this stellar mass range .",
    "in contrast to the extremely low sfes derived from h@xmath11 emission for the dwarfs studied by @xcite , the alfalfa dwarfs studied here are forming stars efficiently , and a large portion of them even have @xmath240 . in particular , 14 out of 17 virgo dwarfs ( red squares ) detected by alfalfa have @xmath241 , suggesting that the cluster environment may actually play a role in enhancing their sfes by either accelerating their evolution and thus driving them to the gas - poor side , or simply stripping part of their gas away .",
    "in contrast , agc  223913 and agc  220819 , both de / dsphs in virgo , have low sfes and @xmath242 .      as specified in  [ cmd ] , we define the gas fraction here simply as the ratio of the hi mass to the stellar mass ( @xmath243 ) , without a correction for the presence of helium or for other phases of hydrogen .",
    "little is actually known about the molecular content of dwarf galaxies other than that it is low .",
    "numerous other studies , e.g. @xcite , have shown that dwarf galaxies , including ones detected in hi , are notoriously difficult to detect in co and contain only small masses of dust . moreover",
    ", the relationship between co and h@xmath15 may break down in galaxies of low metallicity . since the fraction of the ism contributed by very cold molecular material is likely to be insignificant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the uncertainty in it , large , we assume that the alfalfa dwarfs are likely dominated by hi at least on global scales and equate the hi mass with their total gas mass .",
    "figure [ fig : fgas ] presents the distribution of hi mass ( upper panels ) and gas fraction @xmath104 ( lower panels ) as a function of stellar mass , @xmath59 and @xmath108 colors , respectively .",
    "as before , in the left two panels , the alfalfa dwarf galaxies in the _ s - sed _ sample are shown as circles and squares superposed on the parent @xmath33-sdss sample ( black contours and grey points ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed line in the upper panels marks the hi mass cutoff @xmath244 imposed on the _ s - com _ sample . in the lower plots , horizontal dashed line traces @xmath245 while in the lower left panel",
    ", the diagonal dash - dotted line traces the the locus where @xmath246 .",
    "the distributions for the full alfalfa population are smooth , with the mean @xmath68 increasing with @xmath3 , and the mean @xmath104 decreasing monotonically as @xmath3 grows .",
    "unsurprisingly , @xmath104 is tightly correlated with both the @xmath59 and @xmath108 color : bluer galaxies have higher gas fractions . note again that alfalfa probes significantly lower masses , both stellar and hi , than other surveys . imposing a limit in @xmath68 confines the alfalfa _ s - com _ sample to fall below the horizontal dashed line in the upper panels and to the left of the the dashed - dotted line in the bottom left panel . as evident in the bottom row of panels , some of the lowest mass galaxies have extremely high gas fractions ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "visual inspection of the most egregious cases shows that these values are corrupted by poor sdss photometry or , possibly , by the assignment of the wrong oc .",
    "although we have checked the photometry for the dwarf sample individually , only a portion of the ocs in the @xmath33-sdss sample have been inspected individually to set a sdss photometric quality flag @xcite . as a result , it is not surprising that some of the @xmath33 galaxies with @xmath247 suffer from shredding , with a fainter child assigned as the sdss cross - match and thus producing an underestimate of @xmath3 . in other cases ,",
    "confusion within the alfa beam may result in a match to the wrong object albeit the `` most probable '' oc . the complexities and caveats involved in assigning ocs to the alfalfa dataset are discussed in @xcite . however",
    ", some dwarfs really do appear to be highly hi dominated .",
    "for example , agc  174514 in the supplementary _ s - sup _ sample also has a @xmath247 ; its images are shown in figure [ fig : img ] .",
    "it is the bluest galaxy among the _ s - sed _ sample , suggesting that it is truly a galaxy with lots of gas and not many stars .",
    "however , it may not be a single object and the @xmath104 could be a slight overestimate due to the uncertainty of the distribution of the hi ; there are several additional small blue lsb clumps within the alfalfa beam which may contribute comparable optical luminosities , thereby raising the stellar mass by some factor , but certainly not @xmath248 ; this galaxy remains an unusual object with a very high gas fraction .    using a similar @xmath104 vs. @xmath114 diagram",
    ", @xcite found a population of outliers , namely early type galaxies with extremely low @xmath249 , extending below the main distribution ( figure 3 of that paper ) at the bright end ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "they further identified this phenomenon with the large spread in the ssfrs of massive galaxies , suggesting that a dearth of fuel for star formation causes the extremely low ssfrs . in comparison with figure 3 of @xcite , figure",
    "[ fig : fgas ] reveals no concentration of galaxies with low @xmath104 below the main distribution at the high mass end , despite the existence of many low ssfr massive galaxies .",
    "the absence of very low @xmath104 massive galaxies in alfalfa is not surprising given its well - characterized flux completeness and near - constant integration time .",
    "in contrast , some of the hi measures contributed by the @xcite dataset and used by @xcite made use of very deep targeted observations designed specifically to probe to very low gas fractions in massive early type and cluster galaxies . the desire to probe",
    "the true range of gas fractions representative of the most massive galaxies likewise motivated the targeted deep observations of the gass program @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", they found that the population of low mass galaxies with a large spread in ssfrs is not matched by an equivalent shift to a larger range of @xmath104 . on the other hand ,",
    "the broadening of the @xmath104 distribution at the low mass end is more evident in the alfalfa dataset , compared to that seen by @xcite . among the 176 alfalfa dwarfs in the low hi mass _ s - com _ set , only 2 are included in the @xcite catalog .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that @xcite see no broadening of the @xmath104 distribution at the low mass end .",
    "hi selection yields a high overall gas fraction across the full range of sampled masses , and at the same time , still a larger dispersion in the@xmath251 distribution at both the high and low stellar mass ends ( see  [ sfs ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fgas ] , the alfalfa dwarfs in the _ s - sed _ sample ( circles and squares ) lie on the low mass tail of both the @xmath68 and @xmath104 distributions : at low stellar masses , the alfalfa dwarfs probe a relatively low gas fraction population .",
    "this departure from the norm for the majority of the alfalfa detections results from the imposition of the low hi mass cutoff . among the low mass _ s - com",
    "_ galaxies ( filled symbols ) , at a given @xmath68 , the virgo members ( red squares ) have , on average , higher @xmath3 and thus lower gas fractions , than the non - virgo ones ( blue circles ) .",
    "given the general trend between @xmath104 and @xmath3 , the most gas - rich galaxies have very low @xmath3 . even if their @xmath252 , the least massive may lie below the hi sensitivity of alfalfa at the virgo distance ( log @xmath253 ) .",
    "alternatively , the low gas fractions may reflect a possible connection between the cluster environment and relative gas poorness ; in fact , @xcite show that some morphologically early virgo dwarfs contain `` normal '' gas fractions and argue that they must have recently accreted their hi . here , as is seen in figure [ fig : fgas ] , more than half ( 46 ) of the _ s - sed _ galaxies have @xmath252 , meaning that their baryonic mass is dominated by their atomic gas , rather than by their stars .",
    "it is well known that the local surface density of the star formation rate is strongly correlated with the local surface density of gas , @xmath254 , at least when averaged over @xmath10 kpc scales .",
    "a precise measurement of its exponent is the ` kennicutt - schmidt law ' @xcite , @xmath255 )       = \\alpha \\log ( \\sigma_{gas } [ { \\rm m_\\odot\\ pc^{-2 } } ] ) + c,\\ ] ] where @xmath256 $ ] , @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "the denominator of @xmath259 , 1.5 , results from the chabrier imf adopted in this work .",
    "such a super - linear schmidt law ( @xmath260 ) suggests a star formation efficiency which rises with gas surface density .",
    "measurements of azimuthally averaged gas and sfr profiles show that the sfr correlates better with the molecular hydrogen component than with the total gas density at least within the optical disk @xcite . yet ,",
    "on global scales averaged over the whole galaxy , sfrs appear to correlate better with the total gas ( hi + h@xmath15 ) , rather than the molecular gas , surface density @xcite .",
    "global quantities such as those available to us sample a range of gas surface densities , timescales and conditions within the ism , and since we have only global hi measures , we can only estimate @xmath7 by proxy , using the global hi mass and the optical size of the stellar disk .",
    "albeit crude in comparison to more detailed studies of spatial resolved atomic and molecular distributions , we examine via figure [ fig : sfl ] the correlations of global quantities related to the schmidt law to demonstrate the constraints placed by the global hi measures on global sfrs . as before , both the @xmath33 and the dwarf _ s - sed _",
    "samples are shown , with symbol definitions following figure [ fig : sfs ] .",
    "panel ( a ) of figure [ fig : sfl ] , shows the distribution of the sfr as a function of @xmath68 ; this can be thought of as the global atomic and volumetric star formation law .",
    "the green dotted line with a slope of 1.2 is the linear fit to all the @xmath33-sdss galaxies .",
    "the dashed line , of slightly steeper slope 1.5 , is the linear fit to the galaxies in the dwarf _ s - sed _",
    "sample only . while it is natural to expect higher sfrs in galaxies with more gas available to form stars , the alfalfa _ s - sed _ dwarf galaxies define the low hi mass tail of the distribution of star forming galaxies .",
    "note also the presence of a second tail exhibited by the parent @xmath33-sdss population at very low sfrs ; these galaxies may include a population of objects whose hi distributions extend beyond their star - forming disks . in ",
    "[ sfe ] , we have already presented the result that the @xmath234 increases slowly with @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , other recent works demonstrate that the @xmath261 relation steepens at low gas surface densities due to the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the dependence of sfr on @xmath68 for the alfalfa dwarfs shown in panel ( a ) shows a suggestive mild steepening at low @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that the sfr is generally lower in gas rich dwarfs than predicted by the ` kennicutt - schmidt law ' .",
    "again , we note that the linkage of the scaling between sfr and @xmath68 with the power law derived for @xmath8 and @xmath7 is subject to various uncertainties , including the contribution from molecular gas , and the relative extent of the star forming and hi disks . therefore",
    ", this comparison of global quantities yields only a suggestive empirical result .    in panel ( b ) , we normalize both axes by @xmath3 , giving the relationship between ssfr and @xmath104 .",
    "normalization by @xmath3 moves the galaxies in the alfalfa dwarf _ s - sed _",
    "sample from the tail seen in panel ( a ) back to within the main distribution . for the majority of alfalfa galaxies , except those with extremely low ssfr , a clear trend exists : the more gas - rich ( higher gas fraction ) , the higher is the sfr relative to the accumulated stellar mass ( higher ssfr ) .",
    "given the fact that the majority of hi disks are un - resolved by alfalfa , we can not quantify @xmath7 directly .",
    "however , we can characterize the surface densities by introducing an area - related quantity : the stellar surface mass density , @xmath262 .",
    "following @xcite , we define the stellar surface mass density : @xmath263 = \\frac{0.5 m _ * [ { \\rm m_\\odot]}}{\\pi(r_{50 , z } [ { \\rm kpc } ] ) ^2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath264 is the petrosian half - light radius according to the sdss pipeline measurements . panel ( c ) of figure [ fig : sfl ] shows that ssfr decreases with increasing @xmath262 in general , and that the dwarf _ s - sed _ galaxies , on average , have lower @xmath262 than the full alfalfa population . for comparison with other studies ,",
    "we adopt an aperture of radius @xmath264 and assume that , by definition , it encloses also one half of the stellar mass . although it is likely not a correct assumption , we assume first that this aperture also contains exactly half of the global sfr , as well as half of the hi mass , and thus @xmath265 )           = \\log \\frac{0.5 sfr [ { \\rm m_\\odot yr^{-1}}]}{\\pi(r_{50 , z } [ { \\rm kpc } ] ) ^2 }   \\\\      \\log ( \\sigma_{gas } [ { \\rm m_\\odot\\ pc^{-2 } } ] )           = \\log ( \\sigma_{gas } [ { \\rm m_\\odot\\ kpc^{-2 } } ] ) - 6          = \\log \\frac{0.5 m_{hi } [ { \\rm m_\\odot}]}{\\pi(r_{50 , z } [ { \\rm kpc } ] ) ^2 } - 6\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the star formation law averaged within this aperture can be re - written from equation ( [ ksl ] ) as : @xmath266 )           = \\alpha ( \\log \\mu _ * [ { \\rm m_\\odot\\ kpc^{-2}}]-6 )           + \\alpha \\log f_{gas } + c\\ ] ]    certainly the adoption of the right hand side of equation ( [ ksl2 ] ) to infer @xmath8 , is crude at best .",

    "gives a crude relation between the ssfr , @xmath262 and @xmath104 : @xmath267      = \\log \\frac{0.5 sfr [ { \\rm m_\\odot yr^{-1}}]}{\\pi(r_{50 , z } [ { \\rm kpc } ] ) ^2 }           - \\log \\frac{0.5 m _ * [ { \\rm m_\\odot]}}{\\pi(r_{50 , z } [ { \\rm kpc } ] ) ^2 } \\nonumber\\\\      = ( \\alpha-1 ) \\log \\mu _ * [ { \\rm m_\\odot\\ kpc^{-2 } } ]           + \\alpha \\log f_{gas } - 6\\alpha + c. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    adopting the values of @xmath259 and @xmath11 from equation [ ksl ] , we plot the right hand side of this equation on the x axis of figure [ fig : sfl ] panel ( d ) and the left hand side ( @xmath210 ) on the y axis .",
    "although these two quantities are correlated as expected with a slope of @xmath268 , the main distribution is shifted from the one - to - one correlation , represented by the red dashed line , in the sense that the right hand side overestimates the ssfr , i.e. @xmath8 . among the three possible caveats to the adoption of the right hand side of equation ( [ ksl2 ] ) to infer @xmath8 which might lead to systematic errors in the @xmath8 estimates , only the second one , that the hi gas extends beyond the stellar disk , would yield a shift in the correct direction .",
    "additional factors that might cause such a shift include : ( iv ) the alfalfa galaxies have sub - solar metallicity on average , requiring an even smaller @xmath259 ( see  [ z ] ) ; ( v ) because they are gas - rich in general , they also have lower sfes relative to the typical sdss galaxies ( see  [ sfe ] ) , and thus smaller @xmath259 values .",
    "both these interpretations are consistent with what is evident in figure [ fig : sfl ] panel ( d ) , i.e. , the standard @xmath259 @xcite may be an overestimate for an hi selected population .",
    "furthermore , a plot with the same x and y axes as in figure [ fig : sfl](d ) but color coded by the mean sfes of galaxies within each grid cell clearly shows that the offset from the one - to - one line increases with decreasing sfe .    rather than adopting @xmath259 and @xmath11 values from the kennicutt - schmidt law , @xcite calibrated an empirical estimator of @xmath104 from @xmath251 and @xmath262 , reformulated as , @xmath269 corresponding to larger @xmath11 and smaller @xmath259 values than given in equation [ ksl ] .",
    "their best estimator of @xmath104 had @xmath251 substituted by @xmath127 color , since optical colors can be good proxies for ssfrs ( see  [ sfs ] ) . in agreement with @xcite , we also prefer a smaller sfe scaling factor than the @xcite value ( see eqn [ ksl ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite calibrate their @xmath104 estimator from an sdss selected sample with existing hi data and therefore relatively gas poor compared to the alfalfa hi - selected population .",

    "panel ( d ) of figure [ fig : sfl ] shows that , compared to the full @xmath33 distribution , the alfalfa dwarf galaxies appear slightly closer to the one - to - one line given by equation ( [ sfmulaw ] ) .",
    "again , this result may arise from their selection as the lowest @xmath68 systems .",
    "as we have seen , the dwarfs studied here are relatively gas - poor ( see  [ fgas ] ) and have higher sfes ( see  [ sfe ] ) compared to those estimated for the full @xmath33 population in the same _ stellar mass _ range .",
    "therefore the fact that the dwarfs lie closer to the one - to - one relation traced by equation ( [ sfmulaw ] ) is consistent with the finding above that lower than typical sfes drive the overall alfalfa distribution to lower ssfrs for their @xmath262 and @xmath104 .",
    "comparisons of the star forming properties of samples selected either by stellar mass or by hi mass must account for the biases imposed on those properties by the various selection criteria .",
    "with unprecedented sensitivity , areal coverage , angular and velocity resolution , the alfalfa extragalactic hi survey provides us with a homogeneous parent sample of gas - bearing galaxies which approaches a full census of star - forming galaxies .",
    "more than 2/3 of alfalfa sources are new hi detections and thus would not have been included in previous star formation studies of large hi samples based on optical target selection , e.g. @xcite . in this paper , we have examined the population of galaxies detected by alfalfa with the lowest hi masses , combining photometric and spectroscopic data from the sdss and new uv images from galex to probe the relationship between their hi , stellar and star - forming components . compared to other dwarf studies such as figgs @xcite or 11hugs @xcite , the alfalfa dwarf sample includes a much larger number of very low hi mass objects ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "moreover , only 56% of the alfalfa dwarfs within the sdss footprint have a counterpart in the sdss spectroscopic survey confirming that the alfalfa survey is providing an important contribution to the census of dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "being sensitive to very low levels of star formation activity ( below @xmath270 ) , the fuv luminosity is a more robust tracer of the sfr in metal- and dust - poor dwarfs than the h@xmath11 or ir predictors .",
    "we have reprocessed all of the available mis - level galex fuv images for 118 alfalfa dwarfs . only @xmath75 out of those 118 dwarfs is not detected in the fuv : virtually all hi - selected gas - rich dwarfs show some evidence of recent star formation .",
    "examinations of the cmd , uv colors , bpt diagram and @xmath90 all confirm the general notion that hi - selected dwarf galaxy samples are dominated by faint blue cloud galaxies and are more likely to be star - forming than galaxies typically included in optical - uv selected samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sed fitting to uv / optical bands is improved via trimming out the models with unrealistically high extinction .",
    "we demonstrate that estimates of the @xmath184 still suffer from internal extinction in the alfalfa dwarfs . even in such low metallicity , low luminosity systems , neglecting the extinction at fuv wavelengths @xmath157 , as has been the practice of some authors , e.g. @xcite , will lead to the systematic underestimate of fuv luminosity . at the same time",
    ", application of the standard @xmath159 relation given their uv colors would over - predict @xmath157 in many of the lowest hi mass galaxies , possibly because of their different sfh and/or dust geometry .",
    "although limited to the sdss fiber apertures , the sfrs derived from sdss h@xmath11 line flux are compared to those derived from sed - fitting and we can not rule out systematic deficiency in the sfr values derived from h@xmath11 as might be consistent with @xcite . because the alfalfa dwarfs have low sfrs on average , they provide an ideal sample for h@xmath11 imaging to probe this question ; this work is in progress .",
    "many alfalfa dwarfs have high ssfrs and @xmath138-parameters greater than 1 , suggesting that they are currently forming stars in a bursty manner . as a result , it is essential to take the possibility of bursty star formation into full account when modeling their seds .",
    "if a constant sfh is assumed , the calibrations used most often will over - predict the derived properties , e.g. the stellar mass as derived from the mass to light ratio versus color relation @xcite , or the sfr obtained from the fuv luminosity @xcite .    in the ssfr vs. @xmath3 diagram ,",
    "the red sequence galaxies possess low ssfrs .",
    "the dispersion in the ssfr distribution increases at both the high and low mass ends .",
    "factors other than @xmath3 such as environmental effects likely play important roles in the regulation and quenching of star formation in low mass galaxies . in the @xmath104 vs. @xmath3 plot , although @xcite reported broadening in the @xmath104 distribution only at the high mass end , we find a mild increase in the dispersion of @xmath104 only at the low mass end . within the alfalfa dwarf",
    "_ s - sed _ sample , virgo cluster members have lower gas fractions at a given @xmath68 with a wide spread also in the distributions of ssfr or the @xmath138-parameter .",
    "a study of the gas and stars in a larger sample of vcc virgo dwarfs selected by optical criteria will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a clear decrease of the @xmath104 with increasing @xmath3 is seen for the whole distribution , i.e. on average , the low mass galaxies are extremely gas rich for their @xmath3 and relatively unevolved . however , because the alfalfa dwarfs are selected to be the sources with lowest hi masses , the imposition of an hi mass cutoff leads to the selection of a dwarf sample with lower gas fractions for their stellar mass than is characteristic of the @xmath33 sample overall .",
    "therefore , a large portion of the alfalfa dwarfs studied here still have @xmath240 , in particular the more gas poor virgo members .",
    "the hi mass correlates well with the sfr on global scales .",
    "under the simple assumption that the aperture subtended by the half light radius also contains exactly half of the stellar mass , hi mass and star formation , we substitute the general `` kennicutt - schmidt '' star - formation law @xcite into the expression of the ssfr , leading to a predicted relation between ssfr , stellar surface mass density and gas fraction as given by equation ( [ sfmulaw ] ) ; this relation also depends on the exponent @xmath11 and scaling factor @xmath259 in the star formation law .",
    "the observed trend is consistent with the assumption that hi disks are in general more extended than the corresponding stellar ones .",
    "additional possible contributions are that alfalfa galaxies have generally sub - solar metallicity and , probably more importantly , lower sfes , both of which may lead to lower @xmath259 values .",
    "a statistical sample such as that provided by alfalfa allows the study only of global relations between the constituent populations within the galaxies .",
    "clearly , a full understanding of the interaction between gas and stars and the physical mechanisms responsible for laws of star formation requires resolved maps of the distribution of hi , and where feasible , the molecular component as well as deeper and better probes of the stellar population .",
    "alfalfa is already providing the fundamental target list for an on - going evla / spitzer / hst project exploring the lowest hi mass galaxies detected by alfalfa : shield ( survey of hi in extremely low mass dwarfs , * ? ? ?",
    "the completion of the alfalfa survey over then next few years will yield an even richer sample of dwarf galaxies than that studied here .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge the work of the entire alfalfa collaboration team in observing , flagging , and extracting the catalog of galaxies used in this work .",

    "<S> we examine the global properties of the stellar and hi components of 229 low hi mass dwarf galaxies extracted from the alfalfa survey , including a complete sample of 176 galaxies with hi masses @xmath0 and hi line widths @xmath1 80 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> sdss data are combined with photometric properties derived from galex to derive stellar masses ( @xmath3 ) and star formation rates ( sfrs ) by fitting their uv - optical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . in optical images , </S>",
    "<S> many of the alfalfa dwarfs are faint and of low surface brightness ; only 56% of those within the sdss footprint have a counterpart in the sdss spectroscopic survey . </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of the dwarfs have high specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) and estimates of their sfrs and @xmath3 obtained by sed fitting are systematically smaller than ones derived via standard formulae assuming a constant sfr . </S>",
    "<S> the increased dispersion of the ssfr distribution at @xmath4 is driven by a set of dwarf galaxies that have low gas fractions and ssfrs ; some of these are de / dsphs in the virgo cluster . the imposition of an upper hi mass limit yields the selection of a sample with lower gas fractions for their @xmath3 than found for the overall alfalfa population . </S>",
    "<S> many of the alfalfa dwarfs , particularly the virgo members , have hi depletion timescales shorter than a hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> an examination of the dwarf galaxies within the full alfalfa population in the context of global star formation laws is consistent with the general assumptions that gas - rich galaxies have lower star formation efficiencies than do optically selected populations and that hi disks are more extended than stellar ones . </S>"
