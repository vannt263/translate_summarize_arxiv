    "the population of seyfert 1 galaxies has a widely - used sub - classification into narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) and broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( bls1s ) .",
    "while the scheme appears to make an arbitrary distinction based primarily upon the widths of the optical emission lines ( nls1s having h@xmath5 @xmath6 , @xcite ) , this turns out to be an extremely useful terminology as the x - ray properties of the two sub - classes are systematically different .",
    "rapid and large - amplitude variability ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bbf96 ; @xcite ) is a characteristic of nls1s , with the excess variance @xcite typically an order of magnitude larger than that observed for samples of bls1s with the same luminosity distribution @xcite .",
    "spectral properties also vary across the seyfert population with nls1s showing systematically steeper photon indices than those of bls1s across both soft and hard x - ray bands , @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlations between h@xmath7 @xmath8 and both x - ray spectral slope @xcite and excess variance @xcite reveal a continuous range of parameter values between the nls1 and bls1 extremes of the population ; the observed differences are now thought to be driven by a range in a fundamental physical parameter , such as the accretion rate .",
    "a popular idea , originally proposed by @xcite , draws an analogy between seyfert 1 galaxies and galactic black - hole candidates . the latter show steepening in the high state . in this scenario ,",
    "nls1s are sources in the high - state , emitting at higher fractions of their eddington luminosity , hence having higher fractional accretion rates ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "given that nls1s have comparable luminosity to that of the bls1s , it has often been suggested that they also have relatively small central black holes , i.e. , @xmath10 , as opposed to @xmath11 , which is typical for bls1s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "smaller black - hole masses naturally explain both the narrowness of the optical emission lines , which are generated in clouds that have smaller keplerian velocities  hence smaller widths  and the extreme x - ray variability , since the primary emission would originate in a smaller region around the central engine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "higher accretion rates lead to some observational predictions , such as a hotter accretion disk leading ( via inverse compton scattering ) to enhanced soft x - ray emission and an ionized surface for the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "support for the ionized disk is found in the form of k@xmath1 emission from ionized states of fe in six nls1s ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the observation of similar lines in some bls1s , may point to the luminosity of the central source playing as important a role as accretion rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternative explanations of the extreme properties in nls1s are that ( 1 ) the broad - line regions ( blr ) of nls1s have larger radii ( i.e. , the blr gas is more distant from the nucleus ) than in the bls1s @xcite then the narrow width of the lines is a reflection of the lower orbital velocity ; ( 2 ) the nls1s may be low - inclination ( i.e. , observed nearly face on ) systems @xcite . assuming the motions around the central source to be virialized , the narrowness of the lines is due to the fact that the gas is moving preferentially on a plane that is almost perpendicular to the line of sight , hence the line widths are reduced by a factor of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is face - on .",
    "one way to distinguish between these models is to measure the the size and virial mass of the blr via reverberation techniques @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite find that the blrs of nls1s and bls1s have comparable size , while nls1s have virial masses one order of magnitude smaller than bls1s , but can not exclude the second model solely on the basis of reverberation results .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite disfavor the low - inclination model , while @xcite show that the inner regions of bls1s also appear to be observed close to face - on .",

    "the soft and hard x - ray light curves in figure  [ lcv2 ] exhibit similar characteristics , suggesting a short time delay between the variations in each curve . to quantify any correlations we undertook a cross - correlation analysis using the interpolation cross - correlation function ( iccf ) method of @xcite and @xcite as implemented by @xcite .",
    "we calculated the ccfs of the total hard - flux in the 210kev band with respect to the total soft - flux in the 0.71.3kev band , which has the highest signal - to - noise .",

    "given the 180 points in our light curves , the probability of exceeding @xmath50 from uncorrelated samples is @xmath51 0.1% , and the lag is less than 0.07 d at 95% confidence . since the power - law component provides @xmath2 72% of the flux in the mean spectrum 0.71.3kev band , as we will show in  [ meanhump ] , and the power - law component dominates the 210kev band , this correlation is probably dominated by the rapid variability in the power - law flux .              the fractional variability amplitude @xmath52 and its error @xmath53 are defined in @xcite , as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total variance of the light curve , @xmath56 is the mean squared error , and @xmath57 is the mean count rate .",

    "to examine the evolution of timing properties of ton  s180 further , we split the data into 14 evenly - sampled sections across the 12 day _",
    "asca _ observation .",
    "even sampling is important because @xmath52 depends strongly on the duration of the data - train .",
    "the baseline for each time - selected section of data was 75ks with average on - source exposure time 25ks .",
    "we then calculated @xmath52 over each of these one - day intervals ( again with 256s bins in each `` daily '' light curve  ) .",
    "this test showed that @xmath52 is significantly variable showing correlated changes in the soft and hard bands , on a day - to - day basis ( figure  [ 14fits ] ) .    as we will demonstrate in",
    " [ meanhump ] , in the mean spectrum the power - law continuum provides about 72% of the flux in the 0.71.3kev band , and the power - law variations contribute significantly to @xmath52 in both the soft and hard bands , explaining the gross similarity between the quantity in those two bands .",
    "the        slightly greater @xmath52 for the soft band is probably due to a combination of changes in the relative flux levels of two spectral components ( power law and hump ) , and slope changes in the power - law , as we will show in  [ humpfits ] .",
    "source counts were binned with a minimum of 20 counts per energy bin for the spectral analysis . the data from the four instruments were fit simultaneously , with the relative normalizations free to allow for small differences in calibration of the absolute flux and in the fraction of encircled counts encompassed by the sis versus gis extraction cells .",
    "spectral fits were performed using xspec v11.0.1 and response files generated with heasoft v5.0.4 .",
    "ton  s180 is detected at better than 3-@xmath46 level in the sis data for energies @xmath59kev and in the gis data for energies @xmath60kev ( observed frame , in the unbinned spectrum ) .",
    "the photon index @xmath4 ( defined by photon flux @xmath61 ) was determined by fitting a power - law model attenuated by galactic absorption with an additional correction applied to sis0 and sis1 to compensate for the low - energy degradation as described in  [ sistrouble ] . for this fit we used data in the bandpass 1.84.71kev ( observer s frame ) .",
    "the power - law fit yielded @xmath62 and @xmath63 for 683 degrees of freedom ( @xmath64 ) .",

    "hereafter we refer to this component as the `` soft hump '' .",
    "also evident in the main panel is an excess of emission close to 7kev , which is due to an unmodeled fe k@xmath1 emission line .",

    "they are not so serious as to warrant exclusion from the fit .",

    "we confirm the presence of the soft x - ray emission component previously observed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . at the time of writing",
    ", the status of the sis calibration limits the accuracy to which the absolute form of the soft spectral hump can be determined .",
    "thus we adopted a simple parameterization of the soft hump which allowed us to perform a sensitive examination of the flux variability of the component .",
    "the simultaneous _ chandra _ letg data for ton  s180 @xcite and the results for ngc",
    "4051 @xcite show that the soft hump is a smooth continuum component , as opposed to a blend of unresolved spectral features .",
    "the variability study afforded by the _ asca _",
    "data is therefore the optimum available tool for exploring the nature of the soft hump .",
    "this was also shown to be the case for akn  564 @xcite .",
    "we used sis data in the range 0.74.71kev simultaneously with gis data in the range 1.04.71kev ( observer s frame ) .",
    "the lower energy limit of the sis data was based on the level of agreement achieved between the two ccds using our methods of correction (  [ sistrouble ] ) .",
    "the upper energy limit of both sis and gis effectively excluded the fe k@xmath1 regime for these fits , in order to avoid an overly complex model ( which can result in false or local minima being found ) .",

    "we examined the variability of the soft hump using sis data in the range 0.74.71kev simultaneously with gis data in the 1.04.71kev range ( observer s frame ) , as we did for the mean spectrum in  [ meanhump ] .",
    "the model was a simple power - law plus a broad gaussian for the soft hump , with the gaussian peak and width fixed at the values noted in  [ meanhump ] .",
    "the flux of the soft hump , the flux of the continuum power law , and the power - law slope were free parameters .",
    "the time series for the flux of the soft hump is shown in figure  [ 14fits ] .",
    "fitting a constant model to this flux yields @xmath109 for 13 @xmath64 .",
    "the soft hump flux varies by a factor of @xmath110 while the 210kev flux ( when binned the same way ) varies by a factor of @xmath111 .    in akn 564",
    ", @xcite showed that the different amplitudes of variability of the soft hump and power - law ( @xmath112 , compared to @xmath113 ) explain the gross change in softness ratio across the observation . in ton s180 , the amplitude of variation of the soft hump is not so pronounced , although it is clear from the light curves ( figure  [ 14fits ] ) that most of the flares in the hard x - ray flux are also present in the soft hump .",
    "to clarify the situation in ton s180 , we split the data into `` hard '' and `` soft '' states based upon the softness ratio .",
    "we chose t @xmath114 s for our soft - state spectrum , and t @xmath115 s for our hard - state spectrum where t is the time from the start of the observation ( see figure  [ lcv2 ] ) .",
    "fits were performed on each state , as we did for the mean spectrum (  [ meanhump ] ) , and confidence contour plots were generated for the flux of the soft hump versus the photon index , assuming the soft hump shape to be approximately constant during the observation .",
    "the resulting @xmath4soft hump flux contours are well separated ( figure  [ gamhump ] , top ) in both directions .",
    "hence , the confidence contour plot indicates that the source varies significantly in photon index _ and _ strength of the soft hump on a timescale of about one week .",
    "therefore both effects are contributing to the change in softness ratio observed across the baseline of the observation .",
    "the spectral changes observed between the soft and hard states result in a change of the ew of the soft hump from @xmath116ev to @xmath117ev .",
    "since we adopt a fixed soft hump shape in our fits of the 14 time - selected spectra , we are confident our fitting method can separate the fluxes of soft hump and power - law continuum .",
    "furthermore , the bottom panel in figure  [ gamhump ] shows @xmath4 plotted against the strength of the soft hump component and demonstrates a strong correlation ( spearman rank coefficient @xmath118 , probability of chance occurrence is 8@xmath119 ) , as is expected from disk - corona models , as we will see in  [ discussion ] .",
    "if the strength of the soft hump component and the photon index were difficult to separate in the spectral fit , we would expect an anticorrelation instead .",
    "figure  [ gamhump ] also shows that a steeper photon index appears to be associated with a relatively strong soft hump . finally , as noted in ",
    "[ contfits ] , the variations in the shape of the gaussian soft hump are small so that our model for the soft hump parameterizes most of the flux in each time - selected spectrum , and does not weaken our approach in fixing the shape when testing for flux variability .      as we have seen in  [ contfits ]",
    ", figure  [ allratios ] suggests that there are small variations in the strength of the fe emission line . to investigate this possibility , we utilized sis data in the 1.87.45kev range simultaneously with the gis data in the 1.89.42kev range , as we did for the mean spectrum in  [ meanfek ] .",
    "the model was a simple power - law continuum plus different models for the k@xmath1 line , with fixed shape parameters .",
    "we initially tested the assumption of a fixed shape by splitting the data with an intensity division equivalent to an sis0 count rate of 0.6 ^-1 cts s@xmath17 .",
    "this yielded high- and low - state spectra with similar signal - to - noise .",
    "we also calculated confidence contours of line flux versus @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ kacontprof]a shows overlapping contours , thus this division of the data , corresponding to a timescale of about 1 week , reveals no evidence for significant flux variability . using the high and low - state data we then fit for the mean continuum slope as described in  [ meansp ] and overlaid the data in the k@xmath1 band relative to the local power - law slope in each case .",
    "the two line profiles are shown as data / model ratios in figure  [ kacontprof]b and they appear indistinguishable . the same test , performed with the soft- and hard - state division discussed in  [ humpfits ] , leads us to conclude that no changes were observed either in flux or in shape of the line .",
    "figure  [ kacontprof]c , d show the confidence contour and the line profile , respectively , for the soft- and hard - state spectra .",
    "we further tested the possibility that the shape of the line might be variable , on a @xmath2 1 day timescale by overplotting the line profiles for spectra that looked qualitatively different .",
    "no significant changes in the line profile are observed .",
    "once assured that variations of the line shape , if present , are minor , we returned to our 14 time - selected spectra , where we considered the following models for k@xmath1 line : ( 1 ) a laor ( kerr ) model ; ( 2 ) a 2-gaussian model (  [ meanfek ] ) with the two fluxes allowed to vary independently ; ( 3 ) a 2-gaussian model in which either the broad gaussian flux or ( 4 ) the narrow gaussian is flux fixed to the best - fit value from the mean spectrum ; and ( 5 ) a 2-gaussian model in which fluxes have fixed ratio derived from fits to the mean spectrum . all fits were performed with photon index and the flux of the power law continuum left as free parameters .",
    "the shape of the k@xmath1 line was kept fixed to the best fit values obtained for the mean spectrum .",
    "no model component was included for the soft hump , as we excluded the soft - band data for these fits .",
    "figure  [ 14fits ] shows the time series for the k@xmath1 line for the kerr model , yielding results similar to those obtained from models ( 2 ) through ( 5 )",
    ". fits to a constant model yield @xmath120 for 13 @xmath64 , thus the line does not show significant changes in flux when sampled on @xmath2 1 day timescale .",
    "analogous conclusions can be drawn for all other models considered .    finally , we considered the spectra extracted in bins 4 and 13 , which have the highest and the lowest measured k@xmath1 flux , respectively ( figure  [ 14fits ] ) .",
    "we calculated confidence contours of line flux versus @xmath4 and overplotted the line profiles as we did above .",
    "figure  [ kacontprof]e shows the contour plots which demonstrate that the flux variation is insignificant and there is a large overlap of the contours .",
    "figure  [ kacontprof]f shows the line profiles , whose large equivalent widths are consistent at 90% confidence ( ew@xmath121ev , ew@xmath122ev ) .",
    "therefore , we do not detect significant variations in ew or flux of the k@xmath1 line . with the signal - to - noise available using these data",
    "the line flux would have had to vary by at least a factor of 2 for us to detect it at the 99% confidence level ( cf .",
    "figure  [ kacontprof]e ) .",
    "we also applied a laor model to the 1996 _ asca _ observation @xcite , within the same energy ranges as we used here and with the corrections for the sis low - energy degradation appropriate to 1996 ( see  [ sistrouble ] ) , and obtained peak energy , ew , and inclination for the k@xmath1 line consistent with what we found in  [ meanfek ] .      in optical / uv spectroscopy of active galactic nuclei ,",
    "it is easy to obtain a series of spectra of sufficiently high s / n to perform time - resolved spectroscopic analysis . in this case , a useful way to isolate variable features is to construct a root - mean - square ( rms ) spectrum .",
    "this asca long look has allowed us to use our 14 individual time - selected spectra described in ",
    "[ ciccio ] in analogous way . for each detector",
    "the 14 spectra have been rebinned so that each bin has at least a 5-sigma detection ( but up to a maximum of 10 adjacent bins were combined to achieve a signal - to - noise ratio of 5 within a bin ) then they were degraded to the resolution of the worst spectrum .",
    "we created rms and mean spectra by calculating the rms and mean flux in each bin .",
    "the choice of a simple mean as opposed to a weighted mean was dictated by the fact that we did not want to favor the high state spectra .",
    "figure  [ rms_on_mean ] shows the ratio rms / mean spectrum for sis1 and sis0 , using data with energy @xmath123kev .",
    "the mean value is @xmath35% and there is no systematic trend for different energies .",
    "this is consistent with the results from  [ meanhump ] showing that the power - law continuum component contributes most of the flux in the hard band and @xmath77% of the flux in the soft band .",
    "the possible weak trend for energies @xmath124kev of increased variability for decreasing energy , may suggest that the soft hump is partially driving the variability in the soft band .",
    "the `` spike - like '' features at @xmath21.72.5kev are probably due to calibration uncertainties .",
    "1 .   on a 12-day baseline , the x - ray flux of ton  s180 presents trough - to - peak variations by a factor 3.5 in the 0.71.3kev band , and 3.9 in the 210kev band when sampled using 256s bins .",
    "the mean photon index , calculated from the continuum fit of the mean spectrum , is @xmath125 .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy reveals significant changes on timescales of @xmath2 1 week .",
    "we confirm the presence of a separate `` soft hump '' component at energies @xmath0kev .",
    "this component shows flux variations down to timescales of @xmath2 1 day , ranging by a factor of 2.3 in normalization over the 12 days of our observations .",
    "some flux changes appear to match changes in the 210kev flux on this timescale although the soft hump shows a drop in ew from 100 to 84ev across the observation .",
    "minor changes in the shape of the soft hump are apparent on timescales of a few days . 4 .   in our approximately daily sampling the photon index is correlated with the flux of the soft x - ray hump .",
    "5 .   variations in both the photon index and soft hump strength contribute to the change in softness ratio observed across the _ asca _ observation .",
    "the softness ratio reveals spectral variability down to timescales of @xmath3s in addition to the slow decline across the observation .",
    "the power - law and soft hump show divergent behavior on very short ( 1000s ) or long ( 2 weeks ) timescales . 7 .",
    "the fe k@xmath1 line emission is detected with a narrow component peaking at @xmath2 6.8kev , indicating an origin in ionized material . a broad line component ( ew @xmath126ev )",
    "is also evident .",
    "we do not detect significant variations of the fe k@xmath1 line strength or equivalent width , on timescales of @xmath2 1 day12 days .",
    "comparison of our results for ton  s180 with those obtained for akn  564 @xcite reveals broad similarity in the overall shape of the x - ray spectra ( steep power - law continuum , strong soft excess , and ionized , large ew fe k@xmath1 ) , and variability characteristics . given these similarities , that may be indicative of the characteristics of the nls1 as a class , we summarize the properties of these two nls1s in table  [ tonakn ] .",
    "column ( 1 ) lists the properties ; column ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the values for ton  s180 and akn  564 , respectively ; column ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) the references for ton  s180 and akn  564 , respectively .",
    "ton  s180 reaffirms the rapid and large - amplitude x - ray variations which are a characteristic of the nls1 class . during our 12-day observation ,",
    "the light curves sampled on 256s timescales show trough - to - peak flux variations by a factor of @xmath2 3.5 in the soft band ( 0.7 - 1.3kev ) , and up to a factor of @xmath2 4 in the hard band ( 210kev )",
    ". further examination of these light curves shows variations up to a factor of @xmath127 occurring on timescales of @xmath2 1000 s which are sometimes accompanied by spectral changes . there is a strong correlation ( @xmath128 ) between the soft- and hard - band light curves , with a 95% confidence upper limit on the lag of hard with respect to soft of @xmath129d .",
    "the strength of this correlation , the short lag , and the fact that @xmath2 72% of the flux in the soft band is contributed by the power - law continuum while the hard flux is driven by the power - law , indicate that this correlation is dominated by the variations of the power - law continuum itself .",
    "we used these timing data to obtain an estimate of some fundamental parameters for ton  s180 .",
    "our estimate of the accretion efficiency is @xmath130% , marginally above the limit for the efficiency in the schwarzschild geometry , perhaps favoring a kerr geometry .",
    "however , large uncertainties are associated with this estimate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "light - crossing time arguments yield a radius @xmath131 for the emitting region , @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "the 1000s timescale for variability observed in ton  s180 indicates that neither thermal nor viscous / radial drift phenomena can be held responsible for the observed fast variability .",
    "the values of these parameters are consistent with what is generally found for other seyfert 1s .",
    "@xcite discuss a model where soft thermal photons from the accretion disk are compton - upscattered in localized blobs of coronal plasma , constrained by magnetic loops from the disk .",
    "the resulting x - rays from the blobs then illuminate the disk and produce the so - called compton hump and fe k@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the amplitudes and timescales of the rapid variations observed in ton  s180 are consistent with those expected as a result of stochastic noise in the number of reprocessing blobs , which depend on the formation and reconnection of magnetic loops .",
    "the continuum fit to the mean spectrum yields a photon index @xmath62 .",
    "our time - selected spectral fits give @xmath134 ( 1-@xmath46 error ) with variations from 2.38 to 2.62 . the steep index and the range ( @xmath135 )",
    "are comparable with that observed in akn  564 ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the variations on a @xmath19day timescale are significant in the case of akn  564 and not for ton  s180 ( where we detect variations of @xmath4 in @xmath19week timescale ) .",
    "the range of indices is also consistent with that found for the bls1 ngc  7469 ( @xmath138 , * ? ? ?",
    "this may indicate a fundamental similarity in the process which causes slope fluctuations , over a range of different agn .",
    "we confirm the presence of the soft x - ray emission component at energies @xmath0kev previously observed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this component rises above the power - law continuum @xmath139kev , and has recently been shown to be a smooth continuum component rather than a blend of features , not only in ton  s180 @xcite , but also in the nls1 ngc  4051 @xcite .",
    "therefore , our time - selected spectroscopic analysis is particularly well suited to study its variability properties in particular and understand the nature of the soft hump in nls1s in general .",
    "the soft hump shows flux variations on timescales as short as @xmath19day ( the shortest timescales our time - selected spectroscopy can study ) , ranging by a factor of 2.3 in flux over the observation , but always being present .",
    "we note that the fast variability observed in the soft hump of ton  s180 rules out an origin of the soft emission in large - scale components , such as circumnuclear starburst ( as also concluded for the soft hump in akn  564 , @xcite ) .",
    "the hard flux , when similarly binned on timescales of a day , has a range of a factor 1.65 .",
    "the softness ratio shows spectral variability on timescales as short as @xmath3s . in ton",
    "s180 such fast spectral variability can be attributed either to rapid changes in photon index or in the relative strengths of the soft hump and power - law .",
    "in addition to this evidence for divergent behavior on very short timescales , the soft hump and power - law show different trends on timescales of @xmath19 week . the higher value of @xmath52 measured in the soft than in the hard band is probably due to the combined effects of a larger amplitude of variation of the soft hump over the baselines of the observation , and the changes in spectral slope ( which could preferentially affect the soft band if the pivot point lies within the hard band ) .",
    "the correlation observed between the soft hump flux and the photon index in ton  s180 is expected in disk - corona models where an increase of the flux in the soft x - ray / uv component can cool the corona and steepen the power - law continuum @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for akn  564 , where @xcite suggest the corona cooling might be saturated .",
    "iron k@xmath1 line emission is detected , with a broad , asymmetric profile .",
    "it is best parameterized by two gaussian components ; the narrow component peaks at @xmath140kev , which is consistent with emission from highly ionized gas , the broad component consistent with emission from either neutral or ionized gas .",
    "we caution about the reliability of this result because the signal - to - noise in this range is low and the errors on the fitted parameters are correspondingly large ( table  [ kafitstab ] ) .",
    "therefore it seems that the best parametrization for the fe k@xmath1 line is a broad ionized line , which is consistent with previous _",
    "bepposax _ @xcite and _ asca _ @xcite observations .",
    "the broad component is generally thought to originate in the innermost regions of the accretion disk around the central black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and so it is due to highly ionized fe , while the narrow component is thought to be generated in the putative obscuring torus that extends on a parsec scale @xcite , and so is believed to be due to neutral material . in this context , the result of an ionized narrow fe k@xmath1 component is therefore somewhat suprising .",
    "note , however , that observations of such a feature are not unprecedented : @xcite and @xcite detected narrow lines due to highly ionized iron in _ chandra _ observations of mkn  3 and ngc  4151 , respectively .",
    "the fe k@xmath1 emission line has a very large equivalent width , ew @xmath141ev , as previously observed in other _",
    "asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations of ton  s180 , akn  564 , and other nls1s @xcite . these ews are interesting compared to a sample taken across the seyfert 1 population @xcite , which found an average ew @xmath142ev .",
    "one interpretation is in terms of an extreme fe abundance in nls1s , as proposed by @xcite for akn  564 ; this may , in turn , support the proposition that nls1s are seyfert galaxies in an early stage of evolution @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "@xcite show that the expected ews for predominantly h- and he - like fe can be a factor of a few higher than those from neutral fe .",
    "we do not detect significant variations of the fe k@xmath1 line , on timescales of @xmath2 1 day or of @xmath2 1 week .",
    "we note that given our signal - to - noise in the k@xmath1 energy range for the 14 time - selected spectra , the line flux would have had to varied by at least a factor 2 for us to have detected the variation at @xmath143% confidence level .",

    "<S> time - resolved spectroscopy , using approximately daily sampling , reveals that the broad `` soft hump '' component at energies @xmath0kev shows flux variations on timescales as short as 1 day that are well correlated with the photon index and the 210kev band flux . </S>",

    "<S> there is also a statistically significant evidence for a narrow fe k@xmath1 line at @xmath2 6.8kev , indicating an origin in ionized material . </S>",
    "<S> we do not detect significant variations of the fe k@xmath1 line flux or equivalent width on timescales of @xmath2 1 day1 week .    despite evidence for correlated events in the power - law and soft hump on timescales of a day </S>",
    "<S> , the flux correlations clearly do not exist on all timescales . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the softness ratio reveals spectral variability on timescales as short as @xmath3s , indicating that the power - law continuum and soft hump fluxes are not well correlated on this timescale . </S>",
    "<S> the softness ratio also shows a slow decline across the observation , due to a combination of the different time - variability of the power - law continuum and soft hump flux on timescales of @xmath2 1 week .    </S>",
    "<S> our timing analysis and time - selected spectroscopy indicate that the x - ray emission originates within 12 schwarzschild radii . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes and timescales of the rapid variations we observed are consistent with those expected within disk - corona models . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observed fast variability of the soft hump rules out an origin of the soft emission in large scale components , such as circumnuclear starburst . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4soft hump correlation is consistent with the soft hump being produced by up - scattering of the accretion disk radiation within a patchy , flaring disk corona . </S>"
