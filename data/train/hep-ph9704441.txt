    "if supersymmetry is broken at the tev energy scale and the standard @xmath9 gauge symmetry is not extended at that same scale , then the existence of supersymmetry above that scale protects the theory from nondecoupling contributions of physics above that scale . in other words ,",
    "we get the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . however , if the gauge symmetry is extended also at the tev energy scale and it breaks down to that of the standard model together with the supersymmetry , there will be in general new important phenomenological consequences at the tev scale as well as the 100 gev scale . with further simplifying assumptions , the parameters of the two scales may also be related .",
    "a particularly interesting extension of the mssm is the inclusion of an extra u(1 ) factor at the tev energy scale .",
    "the motivation for this could be theoretical .",
    "if the standard model is embedded in a larger symmetry group of rank greater than 4 , such as @xmath10 [ rank 5 ] or @xmath7 [ rank 6 ] , then an extra u(1 ) gauge factor is very possible at the tev energy scale .",
    "this is especially true for the supersymmetric @xmath7 model@xcite based on the @xmath11 heterotic string .",
    "in particular , if only flux loops are invoked to break @xmath7 down to @xmath12 , then a specific extra u(1 ) [ conventionally known as @xmath13 is obtained . remarkably , @xmath14 is also phenomenologically implicated@xcite by the experimental @xmath15 excess .",
    "another possible clue is the totality of neutrino - oscillation experiments ( solar , atmospheric , and laboratory ) which suggest that there are at least 4 neutrinos .",
    "this has been shown@xcite to have a natural explanation in terms of the @xmath7 superstring model with a specific u(1 ) called @xmath16 .    in sec .  2",
    ", we consider a generic extra supersymmetric u(1 ) gauge factor at the tev energy scale with two doublet superfields @xmath0 and a singlet superfield @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is an allowed term in the superpotential .",
    "( note that if @xmath1 has a nonzero charge under the aditional u(1 ) , as is the case if the scalar component of @xmath1 is to acquire a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) so as to break this u(1 ) , then above this breaking scale , no @xmath17 superpotential term exists . )",
    "we then derive its nondecoupling effects on the two - doublet higgs sector at the 100 gev scale . in sec .  3",
    ", we specialize to a class of @xmath18 models derivable from @xmath7 , of which the @xmath14 and @xmath16 models are special cases . in sec .  4 , we discuss how the new @xmath19 mixes with the standard @xmath20 in the general case , and formulate the effects in terms of the oblique parameters @xmath21 or @xmath22 in the @xmath18 models .",
    "we also discuss the generic neutralino sector . in sec .  5 ,",
    "we show how supersymmetric scalar masses are affected by the extra d - terms from @xmath18 . combining this with the results of sec .  2 and sec .  3 , and assuming universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms at the grand - unification scale , we show that there is a relationship between the @xmath18 vacuum expectation value and the well - known parameter @xmath23 used in the mssm . finally in sec .",
    "6 , we have some concluding remarks .",
    "as the u(1 ) gauge factor is broken together with the supersymmetry at the tev scale , the resulting heavy scalar particles have nondecoupling contributions to the interactions of the light scalar particles.@xcite consequently , the two - doublet higgs structure is of a more general form than that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "previous specific examples have been given.@xcite here we present the most general analysis .",
    "we denote the scalar components of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath1 as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 respectively . under @xmath29",

    "we have already discussed this issue in ref .  [",
    "assuming eq .",
    "( 42 ) , we first consider the spontaneous breaking of @xmath18 , _ i.e. _ @xmath36 , which requires @xmath152 to be negative .",
    "this may be achieved by considering the superpotential @xmath153 ( where we have omitted the rest of the mssm yukawa couplings ) together with the trilinear soft supersymmetry - breaking terms @xmath154 along with the soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses . starting with a wide range of given values of @xmath144 , the universal gaugino mass @xmath155 , and the universal trilinear massive parameter @xmath156 at the gut scale , we find that @xmath152 does indeed turn negative near the tev energy scale for many typical values of @xmath48 and @xmath157 .",
    "an example of this is given in fig .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath159 , which is also the mass of the physical scalar boson @xmath37 .",
    "however , as we will discuss shortly , the mass of the @xmath19 so obtained must also be consistent with the desired electroweak symmetry breaking conditions .",
    "we assume that the top quark s pole mass is 175 gev , and that at 1 tev @xmath160 which corresponds to @xmath161 .",
    "we will also assume that at the tev scale and above , the particle content of the model is that of three complete * 27 * s of @xmath7 and some additional field content so as to achieve gauge coupling unification .",
    "the additional field content could be near the unification scale and hence provide threshold corrections that allow the gauge couplings to unify , perhaps even at the string compactification scale .",
    "another possibility is to add an anomaly - free pair of @xmath110 doublet fields so as to mimic gauge coupling unification in the mssm .",
    "such an example is discussed for the @xmath162 model of ref . [ 8 ] .",
    "this model has the same unification scale as is possible in the mssm . in calculating the gauge - coupling beta functions",
    ", we will in fact assume the field content of that model , but the choice of additional matter fields or threshold corrections to bring about gauge coupling unification has no significant effect on our calculation . the fact that such models have three complete * 27 * s has the noteworthy implication that the gauge coupling at the unification scale is approximately the strong coupling .",
    "the reason is that with three copies of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the beta function for @xmath163 is zero in one loop above the tev scale .",
    "similarly , the gluino mass also does not evolve in this approximation .    defining @xmath164 ( where @xmath132 is the scale )",

    ", we show the similar situation for @xmath214 and @xmath221 gev , @xmath222 gev and @xmath223 gev .",
    "these two figures are quite similar except that the mass scale in fig .",
    "5(b ) has been pushed up relative to that shown in fig .",
    "these choices of soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters are fairly typical in that generally we need @xmath144 to be at least twice as great as @xmath224 to find a solution .",
    "further , if we want to have a solution for all @xmath213 less than some value , @xmath156 must be positive and of order @xmath144 .    in figs .",
    "6 - 9 , we illustrate the effects of varying the parameters @xmath225 for a fixed value of @xmath210 .",
    "we look at the solutions for @xmath173 and @xmath191 ( as well as @xmath218 and @xmath219 ) when the four input parameters are varied one at a time around the point @xmath214 and @xmath226 gev , @xmath216 gev and @xmath217 gev .",
    "note from fig . 6 that with decreasing @xmath48 , @xmath173 and @xmath191 both increase .",
    "we do not extend @xmath48 above 0.345 so as to avoid the upper bound coming from fig .",
    "we find also that we can not decrease @xmath48 much below 0.32 for this example and still have a solution for the electroweak breaking . to use smaller values of @xmath48",
    ", one would have to increase the scale of the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters . in fig .",
    "7 , we look at the effect of varying @xmath156 .",
    "the range of @xmath156 examined is restricted because any extension in either direction would require values of @xmath191 larger than can be reached via the @xmath227 term with @xmath157 within the perturbative regime . in fig .",
    "8 , we vary @xmath144 .",
    "note that with increasing @xmath144 , the predicted @xmath173 increases significantly and @xmath191 decreases . in this example , increasing @xmath144 beyond 1200 gev would predict an @xmath191 less than 500 gev and a @xmath173 greater than 10 .",
    "the lower limit of 500 gev for @xmath144 used here is due to the same reason as just given for the range of @xmath156 plotted in the previous figure . in fig .",
    "9 , we show the effect of varying the gluino mass which is also here the gut scale universal gaugino mass . with increasing gluino mass , @xmath173 decreases while @xmath191 increases .",
    "the upper limit of 350 gev used here for the gluino mass again corresponds to about the size of that parameter for this example where increasing it anymore would require values of @xmath218 larger than can be reached perturbatively through the renormalization - group equations .",
    "we find the general trends of fig .",
    "6 - 9 to be typical of other choices of paramter values where consistent solutions exist .",
    "if @xmath144 is demanded to be less than about 1 tev , then in general @xmath228 , where the @xmath229 and @xmath230 yukawa couplings are small enough not to contribute significantly to the renormalization - group equations .",
    "it is interesting to note that in contrast to the mssm , where @xmath231 , solutions with @xmath232 in principle are possible here due to the tev scale d - terms .",
    "however , to have such a solution in practice with @xmath233 gev means having @xmath234 greater than its fixed - point value of about 1.22 with @xmath235 where the gauge couplings run according to the additional exotic field content as we have chosen .",
    "if @xmath59 , where @xmath236 is not small , then eqs .  ( 64 ) to ( 66 ) have additional contributions , but they are always suppressed by @xmath237 relative to @xmath57 , hence our numerical results on @xmath180 and @xmath191 , _ etc .",
    "_ do not change appreciably .",
    "the corrections are only important if the masses and splittings of the two higgs doublets are considered .",
    "we have shown in this paper that there are many interesting and important phenomenological consequences if we assume the existence of a supersymmetric u(1 ) gauge factor at the tev energy scale .",
    "we assume that there is a higgs superfield @xmath1 which is a singlet under the standard gauge group but which transforms nontrivially under this extra u(1 ) so that it may break the latter spontaneously without breaking the former .",
    "we assume also that @xmath2 is an allowed term in the superpotential .",
    "we then analyze the most general form of the higgs potential and derive an upper limit on the lighter of the two neutral scalar higgs bosons of the two - doublet higgs sector as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this generalizes the well - known case of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we then specialize to the case where this extra u(1 ) is derivable from a @xmath7 model with the particle content given by its fundamental * 27 * representation .",
    "we discuss the effect on @xmath3 mixing and the oblique parameters @xmath21 , as well as the extended neutralino mass matrix .",
    "we then work out in detail the consequences for supersymmetric scalar masses .",
    "we note that the mere existence of a spontaneously broken u(1 ) gauge factor at the tev scale implies new important corrections to these masses through the so - called d - terms which are now dominated by @xmath150 instead of just @xmath148 in the mssm .",
    "this changes the entire supersymmetric scalar particle spectrum and should not be overlooked in future particle searches .    assuming universal soft supersymmetry - breaking terms at the grand - unification ( gut ) scale",
    ", we match the electroweak breaking parameters with the corresponding ones from the u(1 ) breaking .",
    "specifically , the values of @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath176 in the well - known two - doublet higgs potential are constrained as shown by eqs .",
    "( 64 ) to ( 69 ) .",
    "we then obtain consistent numerical solutions to these constraints and demonstrate how the u(1 ) breaking scale and the parameter @xmath23 are related through the @xmath2 coupling .",
    "our results are presented in figs .",
    "2 to 9 .    during the final stage of completing this manuscript",
    ", we became aware of ref .",
    "@xcite , which also discusses electroweak symmetry breaking with an additional supersymmetric u(1 ) gauge factor , but the emphasis there is on the case @xmath238 .",
    "the case @xmath239 is also discussed there , but the conclusion is that whereas the breaking of the additional u(1 ) radiatively via the term @xmath227 , already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be achieved with universal soft supersymmetry - breaking terms at the gut scale , it does not work in the large trilinear coupling scenario .",
    "our approach is essentially orthogonal .",
    "we concentrate on solutions where the u(1 ) scale is much larger than the electroweak scale . with the two scales being intimately related through the matching of eqs .",
    "( 64 ) to ( 66 ) with eqs .",
    "( 67 ) to ( 69 ) , it is in fact highly nontrivial to find solutions which are consistent with this matching even with an arbitrary @xmath157 .",
    "we note also that our examples are models with complete @xmath7 particle content and in our approximation , the yukawa coupling @xmath48 is bounded as shown in fig .",
    "3 . in the more general case ,",
    "the bound on @xmath48 increases as the trilinear coupling increases .",
