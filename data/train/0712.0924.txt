    "cosmic radiation is a valuable source of information about various energetic astrophysical processes .",
    "candidates for the production of the most energetic cosmic rays are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "interactions of accelerated protons and electrons with the ambient photons at the acceleration site give rise to very energetic secondary particles .",
    "in particular for proton energies around the knee region of the cosmic ray spectrum , @xmath1 interactions yield a flux of very energetic ( @xmath2  tev ) neutrinos , mainly via production of the @xmath3 resonance and subsequent decays .",
    "various attempts have been made to identify a high - energy neutrino excess in correlation with satellite observations of grbs .",
    "the performed searches comprise both photon - neutrino coincidence studies and investigations of so - called `` rolling time windows '' .",
    "however , the former will obviously fail in case there exists a significant time difference between the arrival times of the photon and neutrino fluxes , whereas the latter can only be succesful in case some grbs produce multiple neutrino detections within the corresponding time windows .",
    "so far , no positive identifications have been reported .    from the above it",
    "is seen that it would be preferable to use an analysis procedure that does not require the simultaneous arrival of photons and neutrinos and which also provides a high sensitivity in case of low signal rates .",
    "such a method , based on a time profile stacking technique , is presented here and evaluated by means of a toy model which mimics grb induced signals as well as ( atmospheric ) background .",
    "the only large scale neutrino telescope currently in operation is icecube and as such we use the parameters of this detector @xcite as benchmark values for our present studies .",
    "our analysis procedure is based on the detection of upgoing @xmath4 tracks and as such our toy model only generates grb positions homogeneously distributed over the hemisphere opposite to the detector location . + for each generated burst location we define the satellite trigger time to be @xmath5 and create a time window of @xmath6  hour around it .",
    "observations with the amanda neutrino telescope @xcite show that a km@xmath0-scale detector will observe on average 300 upgoing muons per 24 hours due to ( atmospheric ) background , homogeneously distributed over the hemisphere and uniformly in time .",
    "therefore , each of the above time windows will be filled with a number of background upgoing muon signals taken from a poissonian distribution with an average number of 25 . to conservatively account for detector resolutions @xcite ,",
    "gaussian spreads of @xmath7s and @xmath8 are introduced to the arrival times and directions , respectively .",
    "only a fraction @xmath9 of the generated burst locations is randomly selected to yield a single upgoing @xmath4 signal . a reasonable estimate for the possible photon - neutrino arrival time difference @xmath10 and its spread @xmath11",
    "can be obtained from the actual burst duration .",
    "satellite observations @xcite exhibit a mean burst duration of about 30  seconds . as such",
    ", the upgoing @xmath4 signal arrival time of each signal burst is taken from a gaussian distribution with a mean @xmath12  s and @xmath13  s. also for these signal muon arrival times and directions the corresponding detector resolutions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are introduced .    in order to optimise the time bin clustering of the signals , the bin size should be taken to be of the order of the temporal signal spread @xmath11 . however , since the observed redshifts of grbs @xcite exhibit a median value of @xmath16 with a spread of 1.3 , cosmological time dilation effects have to be taken into account .",
    "as such , we take for the time profile bin size a conservative value of @xmath17 , corresponding to 150  s. + the fraction @xmath9 we keep as a free parameter in order to determine the sensitivity of our analysis procedure for different sizes of the grb sample .",
    "the above results in a set of identical time windows with upgoing @xmath4 arrival time recordings relative to the corresponding grb trigger time .",
    "+ stacking of all these time profiles will exhibit a uniform distribution for background events .",
    "however , in case the data contain upgoing @xmath4 signals correlated with the grbs , a clustering of data bins is expected , allowing the identification of correlated signals . due to the cumulative character of the procedure",
    ", large statistics can be obtained resulting in a good sensitivity even in case of low signal rates .    for a first investigation of the performance of the procedure we generated 100 grbs in one hemisphere .",
    "all parameters were set to the values mentioned above and for the fraction @xmath9 we used a value of 10% .",
    "the resulting stacked time profile is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : tott1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bkgt1 ] shows that 8 of our generated grbs induced a signal in the stacked time window .",
    "however , due to the presence of a large background we are not able to identify the grb signals on the basis of our observations of fig .",
    "[ fig : tott1 ] alone .    restricting ourselves to an angular region of @xmath18 around the grb location will reduce significantly the background while preserving basically all signal muons .",
    "the corresponding stacked time profiles of our previous generation , but now restricted to an angular region of @xmath18 around the burst location , are shown in figs .",

    "[ fig : bkgt2 ] allows the identification of the grb signals in the central bin . in the analysis of experimental data , however , we do nt have access to the actual corresponding background distribution . as such",
    ", we need to quantify our degree of ( dis)belief in a background observation solely based on the actually recorded signals like in fig .",
    "[ fig : tott2 ] .",

    "we introduce the notation @xmath23 to represent the probability that @xmath19 is true under the condition that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are true . from the theorem of bayes",
    "we immediately obtain @xmath24 introducing an intuitive decibel scale , we can express the evidence @xmath25 for @xmath19 relative to any alternative based on the data @xmath21 and prior information @xmath22 as  : @xmath26 \\quad .",
    "\\label{eq : evidence}\\ ] ] to quantify the degree to which the data support a certain hypothesis , we introduce the bayesian observables @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "since the value of a probability always lies between 0 and 1 , we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 . together with eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath31 in other words : there is no alternative to a certain hypothesis @xmath19 which can be supported by the data @xmath21 by more than @xmath32 decibel , relative to @xmath19 .",
    "+ so , the value @xmath33 provides the reference to quantify our degree of belief in @xmath19 .    in our evaluation of the stacked time profile",
    "the main question is to which degree we believe our observed distribution to be inconsistent with respect to a uniform background .",
    "this question can be answered unambiguously if we are able to determine the @xmath32 value corresponding to the uniform background hypothesis @xmath19 based on our observed stacked time profile .",
    "the process of recording uniform background signals is identical to performing an experiment with @xmath34 different possible outcomes @xmath35 at each trial .",
    "obviously , @xmath34 is in our case just the number of bins in the time profile , the number of trials @xmath36 is the number of entries and all the probabilities @xmath37 corresponding to the various outcomes @xmath38 on successive trials are equal to @xmath39 . as such , the probability @xmath40 of observing @xmath41 occurrences of each outcome @xmath38 after @xmath36 trials is given by the multinomial distribution .",
    "this immediately yields the following expression for the corresponding @xmath32 value @xmath42~. \\label{eq : psi}\\ ] ]",
    "evaluation of the expression of eq .   for the data displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : tott1 ] and [ fig : bkgt1 ] yields @xmath43  db and @xmath44  db , respectively .",
    "consequently , it is required to determine the @xmath32 value of the corresponding background before the statistical significance of an observed time profile can be evaluated .",
    "one way to investigate background signals is to record data as outlined above , but with fictative grb trigger times not coinciding with the actual @xmath45 . in order to have similar detector conditions for both the signal and background studies ,",
    "background data may be recorded in a time span covering 1 day before and 1 day after the grb observation .",
    "this provides at least 25 different background time profiles per burst , which in turn yield the corresponding different stacked background time profiles allowing the determination of an average value @xmath46 and the corrresponding root mean square deviation @xmath47 .    in the case of the situation reflected by fig .",
    "[ fig : tott1 ] this yields @xmath48  db and @xmath49  db , which is seen to be in excellent agreement with the actual background value corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : bkgt1 ] .",
    "+ comparison of the actually observed @xmath32 value of 713.38  db with the reconstructed background values immediately shows that no significant signal is observed .",
    "+ however , evaluation of the data corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : tott2 ] yields @xmath50  db with background values @xmath51  db and @xmath52  db . here a statistically significant signal is obtained .",
    "variation of the number of grbs allows a determination of the minimal value of the fraction @xmath9 for which a statistically significant signal can be obtained .",
