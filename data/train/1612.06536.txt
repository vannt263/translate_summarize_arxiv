    "regge calculus was proposed to formulate einstein s general relativity on piecewise linear manifolds @xcite .",
    "it provides coordinate - free lattice formulation of gravitation and has been used in investigations of classical as well as quamtum gravity .",
    "as is the case of qcd , lattice theoretical approach provides a powerfull framework in nonperturbative studies of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "however , before moving to detailed quantum study , it is desired to investigate the formalism at the classical level .",
    "any lattice regularized theory should reproduce basic results of corresponding continuum theory .",
    "taking classical continuum limit is relatively easy in the case of lattice gauge theories .",
    "the reason of this is obvious . in lattice",
    "gauge theory space - time itself is not dynamical .",
    "we usually consider hypercubic regular lattice for the space - time .",
    "dynamical variables sit on sites for matter fields and on links for gauge fields .",
    "classical lattice actions are written in manifestly gauge invariant form by using plaquette variables and covariant differences whose classical continuum limits can be taken easily . though the lorentz invariance is absent from the beginning , lattice action is still invariant under discrete rotations .",
    "the lorentz invariance is considered to recover in the continuum limit . in regge calculus , however , the space - time itself should be considered as dymnamical .",
    "we replace it by a piecewise linear manifold , which is composed of a set of simplices .",
    "the basic variables are the edge lengths of the simplices . for a given piecewise linear manifold we can write the regge action . in general",
    "there is no natural choice of piecewise linear manifold .",
    "furthermore , the regge action is written in coordinate - free form .",
    "hence , the recoverance of general coordinate invariance in classcal continuum limit becomes much more complicated than that of lorentz invarinace in nonabelian lattice gauge theories .    in this note",
    "we investigate friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe of three - dimensional einstein gravity with positive cosmological constant in regge calculus .",
    "the contimuum action is given by @xmath2 it is well - known in three dimensions that the vacuum einstein equation leads to flat space - time without the cosmological term . in the case of negative cosmological constant",
    "the theory admits black hole solution @xcite and has been investigated within the context of conformal field theory @xcite . as in four dimensions",
    "the einstein equations have evolving universe as a solution for the flrw metric ansatz @xmath3 where @xmath4 for the space being spherical , euclidean and hyperspherical , respectively , and @xmath5 is the so - called scale factor .",
    "it is subject to the friedmann equations @xmath6 of these our concern is the spherical universe , which can be approximated by convex polyhedron of a finite volume .",
    "regge calculus has been applied to four - dimensional closed flrw universe by collins and williams @xcite .",
    "they considered regular polytopes as the cauchy surfaces of discrete flrw universe and used , instead of simplices , truncated world - tubes evolving from one cauchy surface to the next as the building blocks of piecewise linear space - time .",
    "their method , called the collins - williams ( cw ) formalism , is based on the idea of the @xmath7 decomposition of space - time and plays a similar role of well - known adm formalism @xcite .",
    "recently liu and williams has extensively studied the discrete flrw univese @xcite .",
    "they found that the universe with regular polytopes as the cauchy surfaces can reproduce the continuum flrw universe to a certain degree of precision .",
    "their solutions fairly agree with the continuum when the size of the universe is small , whereas the deviations from the exact results become large for the large universe because of the finite edge length .",
    "since the regge action heavily depends on the choice of polytopes to approximate the cauchy surface , it seems to be hard to take the continuum limit keeping the action simple .",
    "this motivates us to investigate simpler but less realistic three - dimensional model .    in four dimensions",
    "there are six types of regular polytopes . restricting to those obtained by tessellating the three - dimensional sphere by regular tetrahedrons",
    ", there are only three with 5 , 16 and 600 cells @xcite .",
    "the foregoing investigations are mainly restricted to these regular polytopes .",
    "the regge equations , however , are still very complicated .",
    "as we shall show the situation becomes much simpler in three dimensions , where every geometric calculations can be done without complications coming from higher dimensions .",
    "this is the reason why we consider three dimensions , where the spherical cauchy surfaces are replaced by regular polyhedrons .",
    "there are five types of polyhedrons .",
    "we treat them in a unified way and give generic expressions for the regge equations , which is convenient to analyze the continuum limit .",
    "let us briefly summarize the essence of regge calculus . in regge calculus , an analog of the einstein - hilbert action",
    "is given by the regge action @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the volume of a hinge , @xmath10 the deficit angle around the hinge @xmath11 and @xmath12 the volume elements of the building blocks of the piecewise linear manifold . in three dimensions",
    "the hinges are the links , or equivalently the edges of the 3-simplices , and @xmath9 is nothing but the edge length @xmath13 .",
    "regge s original derivation is concerned with simplicial lattice , so that it describes the gravity as simplicial geometry .",
    "this formalism can easily be generalized to arbitrary lattice geometries .",
    "we can fully triangulate the non - simplicial flat blocks by adding extra hinges with vanishing deficit angles @xcite without affecting the regge action .",
    "the fundamental variables in regge calculus are the edge lengths @xmath13 .",
    "varying the regge action with respect to @xmath13 , we obtain the regge equations @xmath14 note that there is no need to carry out the variation of the deficit angles owing to the schlfli identity @xcite @xmath15 in three dimensions the regge equations simply relate the deficit angle around an edge to the total rate of variation of the volumes having the edge in common with respect to the edge length . in particular the space - time becomes flat in the absence of the cosmological term as it should be .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we setup the regular polyhedral universe in the cw formalism and introduce the regge action .",
    "derivation of the regge equations is given in section [ sec : req ] .",
    "in the continuum time limit the regge equations are reduced to differential equations . applying the wick roation",
    ", we arrive at the equations , regge calculus analog of the freedmann equations , describing the evolution of the polyhedral universe .",
    "this is done in section [ sec : ctl ] . in section [ sec : nsol ] we solve the differential regge equation numerically and compare the scale factors of the polyhedral universe with the continuum solution . to have better approximations we introduce geodesic domes as the cauchy surface . in section",
    "[ sec : gdu ] we propose a geodesic dome universe as a pseudo - regular polyhedral universe with a fractional schrfli symbol and show that the continuum solution can be recovered in the infinite frequency limit . section [ sec : sum ] is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "the flrw metric ( [ eq : flrwm ] ) describes expanding or contracting universe with a maximally symmetric space as the cauchy surface .",
    "surfaces of maximally symmetric compact space are spheres .",
    "it is geometrically characterized by the radius @xmath5 , the scale factor in cosmology . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with the regge calculus of closed flrw universe in three dimensions , which describes an evolution of two - dimensional sphere . following the cw formalism",
    ", we replace the spherical cauchy surfaces by regular polyhedrons .",
    "the fundamental building blocks of space - time are world - tubes of truncated pyramids or frustums as depicted in figure [ fig : fbb ] . in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to regular polyhedrons as the cauchy surfaces .",
    "then every edge has equal length in each cauchy surface and so does any strut between two adjacent cauchy surfaces .",
    "evolution of the universe can be seen by focusing our attention only to expanding or shrinking of a face of the polyhedron .",
    "this considerably reduces the number of dynamical variables .",
    "it is well - known that there are only five types of regular polyhedrons , a tetrahedron , cube , octahedron , dodecahedron and icosahedron .",
    "let us denote the numbers of vertices , edges and faces of a polyhedron by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively",
    ". then they are constrained by euler s polyhedron formula @xmath19 a regular polyhedron is specified by the schlfli symbol @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the numbers of sides of each face and @xmath22 the number of faces meeting at each vertex .",
    "they give rise to further constraints @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these together with ( [ eq : epf ] ) completely determine @xmath25 . in table",
    "[ tab : rph ] we summarize the properties of regular ployhedrons for reader s reference .",
    ".five regular polyhedrons in three dimensions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to avoid the difficulty we regard the geodesic dome as pseudo - regular polyhedron of an average edge length @xmath26 and assume that ( [ eq : hcphu ] ) and ( [ eq : mcphu ] ) still hold true .",
    "how about the schlfli symbol @xmath20 ?",
    "since all the faces of the geodesic dome is triangle , we use @xmath27 . as for @xmath22 , we employ the average number of faces meeting at a vertex .",
    "we thus assign the fractional schlfli symbol for the geodesic dome of frequency @xmath28 as @xmath29 this recovers icosahedron for @xmath30 and approaches @xmath31 as @xmath28 gets large , which corresponds to the tessellation of flat plane with regular triangles .",
    "if we introduce average dihedral angle for the geodesic dome universe by ( [ eq:31 ] ) as in the case of regular polyhedron univese and define the scale factor as ( [ eq : rc ] ) , then the evolution of the universe can be described by ( [ eq:33 ] ) with the parameters ( [ eq : ssprp ] ) .",
    "the initial edge length is given by @xmath32 in contrast to the cases of regular polyhedrons this can be arbitrarily small as @xmath33 , or equivalently @xmath34 .",
    "the initial scale factor ( [ eq:35 ] ) , however , approaches to the value of the continuum theory as can be easily seen from @xmath35    there is no difficulty to numerically integrate ( [ eq:33 ] ) for fractional @xmath22 .",
    "we give plots of dihedral angle in figure [ fig : dhagdm ] and scale factor in figure [ fig : sfgdm ] as functions of time for @xmath36 . as we have mentioned before , the dihedral angle is a monotone decreasing function of time .",
    "the era of almost constant dihedral angle for small @xmath37 gets longer with the frequency of geodesic dome .",
    "one easily see that the results for the polyhedral universe given in sect .",
    "[ sec : ctl ] is more and more improved as @xmath28 increases .        in figure",
    "[ fig : lflthgdm ] we give the dihedral angle for @xmath38 .",
    "it apporaches to a constant solution @xmath39 in the infinite frequency limit .",
    "indeed , @xmath40 satisfies ( [ eq:32 ] ) and ( [ eq:33 ] ) as one can verify directly .",
    "the scale factor for the geodesic dome universe with @xmath38 is plotted in figure [ fig : lflargdm ] . during the era of almost constant dihedral angle",
    "the agreement with the continuum scale factor can be seen immediately .",
    "the velocity of expansion @xmath41 still approaches to a constant value ( [ eq:36 ] ) as @xmath42 for finite @xmath28 . in the infinite frequency limit @xmath43",
    "becomes arbitrarily large .",
    "this property is required for the geodesic dome universe to correctly converge to the flrw universe .",
    ": the broken line corresponds to the solution in the infinite frequency limit @xmath44 . ]    : the broken curve is the scale factor of the continuum theory . ]",
    "it can be shown that the scale factor of the geodesic dome universe @xmath45 approaches to that of the continuum theory in the infinite frequency limit .",
    "the easiest way to see this is to come back to ( [ eq : hcphu ] ) and ( [ eq : mcphu ] ) . rewriting them in terms of @xmath46 and then taking the limit @xmath47",
    ", we obtain the continuum equations of the scale factor ( [ eq : cc ] ) .",
    "this justifes the approach regarding ( [ eq : hcphu ] ) and ( [ eq : mcphu ] ) as the equations of motion of discretized flrw universe .",
    "we have investigated closed flrw universe in tree dimensions using the cw formalism in regge calculus . we have given unified expressions applicable to any regular polyhedron as the cauchy surfaces .",
    "we have shown that the regge equations in the continuum lorentzian time limit , one corresponding to hamiltonian constraint and the other to momentum constraint , describe the evolution of universe . in spite of the simplest approximations of spheres by regular polyhedrons the coincidence with the continuum solution is appreciable when the size of the universe is around the minimum , where the nonlinearity of the evolution equation ( [ eq : mcphu ] ) can be neglected .",
    "the discrepancies , however , become larger and larger with the size of the universe . in particular , the expansion speed of the universe approaches to a constant as time goes to infinity , whereas the dihedral angle around the time - like struts appoarches to zero .",
    "we have seen that the geodesic dome model can remedy the shortcoming of the regular polyhedral universe . by choosing the frequency sufficiently large",
    "the expansion velocity of the geodesic dome universe can be arbitrarirly large and the dihedral angle approaches to the natural value @xmath48 as time goes to infinity .",
    "we found that the continuum solution can be obtained in the infinite frequency limit . strictly speaking ,",
    "we have not carried out the regge calculus for the geodesic domes . instead of solving exact regge equations , we have only assumed that ( [ eq : hcphu ] ) and ( [ eq : mcphu ] ) are valid for an average edge length and the fractional schlfli symbol ( [ eq : ssprp ] ) .",
    "it is desired to give further justification , numerically or analytically , to the assumption .",
    "it is also of great interest to extend our approach to four - dimensional flrw universe .",
    "we have considered closed compact universe . in the continuum theory",
    "there is an oscillating solution for negative cosmological constant , where the cauchy surface is not compact .",
    "application of our approach to hyperspherical universe might be interesting .",
    "our concern in this work was the vacuum solution .",
    "inclusion of matter is also interesting .",
