    "the last twenty years have witnessed remarkable improvements in the sophistication and precision of methods devoted to the extraction of parton density and fragmentation functions from experimental hard scattering data .",
    "these distributions are essential ingredients for any phenomenological study of hard scattering processes involving identified hadrons in the initial and final - state , respectively .",
    "their precise knowledge is not only critical for testing the very successful framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) but , in more general terms , also for quantifying uncertainties for precision studies of the standard model and searches of `` new physics '' at high energy accelerators like the cern - lhc . at the same time ,",
    "parton densities and fragmentation functions give fundamental insights into nucleon structure and the hadronization mechanism .    with the gain in precision and refinements of analyses , modern parton distribution functions ( pdfs )",
    "have often revealed intriguing aspects of hadronic structure , such as the sizable breaking of isospin symmetry in the light sea quark sector , suggestions of differences between the strange quark and anti - quark distributions , the steep rise of the distributions at small momentum fractions , and an interesting pattern of modifications of the distributions in nuclei , to name just a few .",
    "certainly one of the most striking results is the unexpectedly small fraction , about a quarter , of the proton s spin that can be attributed to the intrinsic angular momenta of quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "this finding , famously dubbed `` proton spin crisis '' , has triggered a flurry of experimental and theoretical activity aiming at clarifying the contributions of gluons and orbital angular momenta of partons to the spin of the proton @xcite .",
    "the only way to effectively deconvolute the experimental information on pdfs , which in its raw form is smeared over the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath1 , summed over many different partonic subprocesses , and taken at different hard scales @xmath2 for each data point , is a `` global qcd analysis '' .",
    "it treats all available probes simultaneously , in order to extract the set of universal pdfs that yields the optimal theoretical description of the combined data . for the case of polarized pdfs ,",
    "the available world - data are from polarized deep - inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite , semi - inclusive dis ( sidis )  @xcite , photo- and electroproduction of hadrons and charm @xcite , and proton - proton ( @xmath3 ) collisions at bnl - rhic  @xcite .",
    "the different data sets are complementary in the sense that they probe different aspects of the helicity dependent pdfs .",
    "fully inclusive dis data from the many different experiments are pivotal in precisely determining the sums of quark and anti - quark distributions , sidis data help to tell different quark flavors and quark and anti - quarks apart , and rhic @xmath3 data give a first direct constraint on gluon polarization .    a global qcd analysis of nucleon spin structure at full next - to - leading ( nlo ) accuracy was completed recently @xcite .",
    "the present paper gives in large part a more detailed account of the methods and results of @xcite .",
    "it also addresses the issue of the uncertainties of the pdfs in a more detailed and comprehensive way . as customary for recent unpolarized pdf analyses",
    "@xcite , we provide sets of polarized pdfs associated with displacements in the pdf parameter space in the vicinity of the best fit which greatly facilitate the propagation of pdf uncertainties to any observable of interest .    as a new feature over all previous fits based only on dis",
    "@xcite , or combined dis and sidis data @xcite , the analysis @xcite included for the first time also results from polarized @xmath3 scattering at rhic in a nlo framework .",
    "it benefitted significantly from an improved knowledge of parton - to - hadron fragmentation functions @xcite which are an essential non - perturbative input for the theoretical description of all processes with identified hadrons in the final state , such as sidis .",
    "for the first time , these fragmentation functions provide a good description of identified hadron yields in the entire kinematic regime relevant for the analysis of polarized sidis and @xmath3 data @xcite . for the time being , hadron and charm production data from fixed - target experiments @xcite , which constrain the gluon polarization at momentum fractions around @xmath4 , were not included in the analysis @xcite since nlo calculations of the relevant cross sections are not yet complete @xcite .",
    "we will provide a comparison to these data in order to demonstrate their consistency with the results of the global fit .",
    "rhic data for charged pion spin asymmetries @xcite are also not taken into account as they are still preliminary and statistically not as significant as the neutral pion or jet data @xcite . with sufficient statistics ,",
    "however , they can provide an important constraint on the gluon polarization as will be shown below .",
    "the use of parton distributions in predictions for standard model benchmark processes , e.g. , as `` luminosity candles '' at the lhc , or in understanding fundamental properties of a nucleon like its spin , not only requires a careful extraction of pdfs from data but also a proper assessment of their uncertainties and how they propagate to other observables of interest . in spite of a great deal of activity and many significant achievements for both parton distribution and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) ,",
    "this has shown to be a rather formidable task in practice  @xcite .",
    "the specific challenge of a global qcd analysis is to incorporate a large body of data from many experiments with diverse characteristics and errors .",
    "the complications are compounded by uncertainties inherent to the theoretical framework used to describe the data , which are notoriously difficult to quantify .",
    "examples are the choice of the factorization scale , the functional form used to parameterize the pdfs , or unavoidable approximations and assumptions limiting the parameter space",
    ".    several complementary strategies have been devised and implemented to estimate uncertainties of pdfs and ffs  @xcite . in general , one starts with introducing an effective @xmath5 function that combines all phenomenological inputs to the analysis as a quantitative measure of the goodness of the global fit . minimizing this @xmath5 function",
    "yields the optimal set or `` best fit '' of parameters in the multi - dimensional space defining the pdfs .",
    "the most common method to determine the range of uncertainties is to study the dependence of @xmath5 near its global minimum based on a taylor expansion and keeping only the leading term as characterized by the error matrix or its inverse , the hessian matrix  @xcite .",
    "this _ assumes _ a quadratic form in the displacements of all parameters from their optimum values .",
    "the hessian also determines the uncertainties of any other physical observable @xmath6 , provided that the dependence of @xmath6 on the fit parameters is approximately linear around the minimum . both assumptions are not necessarily adequate in the complex global analysis environment , and their range of applicability needs to be carefully scrutinized .",
    "the more robust method of lagrange multipliers  @xcite circumvents all these shortcomings and is free of assumptions concerning the functional dependence of @xmath5 on the fit parameters .",
    "the idea is to explore directly how the fit to data deteriorates if one enforces certain values for an observable @xmath6 away from its best fit value . in practice ,",
    "one performs a series of constrained fits in which @xmath5 is minimized for particular values of @xmath6 , in order to map out the parametric relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the method is straightforward to implement and can be applied to any combination of physical observables or even to fit parameters themselves",
    ". we will pursue and compare both methods , hessian and lagrange multiplier , to estimate uncertainties for the shape and truncated first moments of helicity - dependent pdfs using the analysis presented in @xcite as the starting point .",
    "the lagrange multiplier technique will provide the necessary benchmarks for testing the accuracy of approximations within the hessian method .",
    "we note that alternative approaches recently proposed in the literature include studies of uncertainties based on neural networks or large samples of pdfs generated with monte - carlo methods  @xcite .    in any case ,",
    "all of these methods require an extensive number of calculations and minimizations of the effective @xmath5 function , in order to explore the very complex and entangled sensitivity of the data to variations of the parameters describing the pdfs .",
    "this calls for new and more efficient calculational tools to include all observables used in the global fit consistently at nlo accuracy without resorting to potentially unreliable approximations .",
    "in particular , numerical computations of nlo cross sections in hadron - hadron scattering are prone to being very time consuming .    in order to deal with this problem , ref .",
    "@xcite employed a method based on the mellin transform technique proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which allows to speed up the relevant nlo computations to a level that they can be incorporated in the global analysis .",
    "an important improvement of this mellin transform method was the implementation of a novel monte - carlo sampling technique .",
    "this new computational strategy proved already very useful for the analysis of single - inclusive observables in @xmath3 scattering that are presently relevant at rhic .",
    "however , it is completely general and becomes especially powerful when less inclusive observables like two - particle correlations in hadronic collisions need to be incorporated in the global qcd fits , as will soon be the case . in the present paper",
    "we will describe the mellin transform technique and its improvement in detail .",
    "we note , that the fast and efficient mellin technique for incorporating nlo @xmath3 processes is , of course , not restricted to analyzing helicity - dependent pdfs , but could equally find important applications for qcd processes at the lhc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe all technical details of a global pdf analysis .",
    "we first discuss the @xmath5 function and the underlying ideas of the hessian and lagrange multiplier approaches for estimating pdf uncertainties .",
    "we next describe in detail our mellin moment and monte - carlo sampling techniques as implemented for fast evaluations of nlo @xmath3 cross sections in our global qcd analysis . in sec .",
    "iii we apply all techniques to the global analysis of helicity - dependent pdfs @xcite .",
    "we discuss the results for the best fit and its uncertainties .",
    "we argue that the range of applicability of the hessian method is limited to estimating uncertainties of helicity - dependent pdfs consistent with only small departures from the best global fit , corresponding to @xmath7 .",
    "we present sets of polarized pdfs associated with displacements along the eigenvector directions of the hessian matrix and resulting in @xmath8 , which characterize the pdf parameter space in the vicinity of the global minimum in a process - independent way .",
    "we also explore the impact of the individual data sets on the results and uncertainties obtained for helicity - dependent pdfs in the global fit . in sec .",
    "iv we study the potential of upcoming measurements at rhic at @xmath9  gev center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . ) energy for further constraining the polarized pdfs .",
    "we focus on predictions for single - inclusive pion and jet production , and on @xmath0 boson single - spin asymmetries .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "in this section , we will describe all techniques we use for the global analysis of polarized pdfs .",
    "the first two subsections discuss the @xmath5 function and the various methods for the analysis of pdf uncertainties .",
    "much of the discussion here will follow the pioneering work in refs .",
    "we then lay out the details of our mellin moment and monte - carlo sampling techniques .",
    "global qcd extractions of pdfs @xcite or ffs @xcite are implemented around an effective @xmath5 function that quantifies the goodness of the fit to data for a given set of theoretical parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 that determines the pdfs or ffs at some initial scale @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest @xmath5 function , convenient for the search for optimum pdfs by minimization , is usually taken as @xmath13 where @xmath14 counts the individual experimental data sets and @xmath15 the corresponding number of data points in each set .",
    "each data value @xmath16 is compared to the corresponding theoretical estimate @xmath17 , which depends in general non - linearly on the @xmath18 parameters @xmath10 , weighted with the estimated uncertainties combined in @xmath19 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2def ] ) @xmath20 is a special weighting factor for each data point with default value one .",
    "it can be set to zero if a certain data point is to be removed from the analysis due to some physics considerations .",
    "for instance , such cuts are routinely introduced in a global fit to remove kinematical regions where the framework of perturbative qcd used to compute @xmath21 is known to be not adequate for describing the available data .",
    "the simple form ( [ eq : chi2def ] ) for @xmath5 is appropriate only in the ideal case of data sets with uncorrelated errors , and @xmath22 is then given by statistical and point - to - point systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "for most experiments , additional information on the fully correlated normalization uncertainty @xmath23 can be found , i.e. , on a systematic shift common to the entire data set .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : chi2def ] ) is straightforwardly extended to account for such normalization uncertainties : @xmath24\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath25 are the normalization factors , which can be either fitted along with the @xmath10 , or even determined analytically in each step of the minimization by solving @xmath26  @xcite",
    ".    there are several equivalent methods of extending further the simple @xmath5 function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2def ] ) in the presence of @xmath27 sources of correlated systematic errors for a data point @xmath16 in data set @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the numerically most efficient method treats the correlated systematic errors analytically in the optimization procedure like for the global normalization uncertainties discussed in ( [ eq : chi2defnorm ] ) .",
    "this avoids the construction and inversion of large covariance matrices used in the conventional approach .",

    "we note that most global analyses of unpolarized pdfs now start to include correlated systematic errors whenever this information is available from experiment .",
    "this is of much importance , as very precise pdf uncertainty studies are a key ingredient for reliably estimating new physics signals and standard model backgrounds at the tevatron or the lhc . for the time being , and keeping in mind that our analysis is the first fully global one of this kind for polarized pdfs , we stick to an effective @xmath5 function based on the simplest expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2def ] ) .",
    "also , most of the relevant experiments do not publish the full information on correlated systematic errors .",
    "whenever a global normalization uncertainty is provided , we have explored the possibility of normalization shifts to improve the global fit by minimizing @xmath5 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2defnorm ] ) .",
    "we have not found any significant improvements of the fit from this . since data sets are continuously evolving and more and more precise information becomes available , the proper inclusion of correlated systematic errors is certainly needed in future global analyses of helicity pdfs .    as mentioned in the introduction , there are considerable complications when statistical methods are applied to global qcd analyses based on a large body of diverse data and a theoretical model with many parameters @xmath10 . in particular , the statistical value of the definitions given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chi2def])-([eq : chi2defcor ] ) has been under considerable debate  @xcite , since both the theoretical [ @xmath21 ] and the experimental inputs [ @xmath16 , @xmath36 are far from being ideally suited for statistical analysis . for instance , uncertainties inherent to the theoretical framework used to describe the data are notoriously difficult to quantify and usually correlated . in addition , it is often the case that even in a `` best fit '' to data , the values of @xmath5 per data point for individual experiments vary considerably around unity , sometimes by much more than the expected amount @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , conclusions drawn on a tolerable range of uncertainty from a certain increase @xmath38 , must be considered keeping in mind this complex situation .",
    "an important objective is to estimate uncertainties of the spin - dependent pdfs obtained from the @xmath5 optimization . to this end",
    "one must study the behavior of the effective @xmath39 function in the neighborhood of the global minimum @xmath40 , using reliable statistical methods rather than some subjective tuning of selected parameters .",
    "basically two complementary tools have been put forward , refined to deal with the complexity of global pdf analyses , and applied to characterize uncertainties in the extraction of unpolarized pdfs .",

    "no assumptions are made regarding the dependence of @xmath5 or the observable @xmath63 on the parameters @xmath10 of the fit .",

    "( [ eq : lagrange ] ) .    in principle",
    ", the lagrange multiplier method is superior to the hessian approach for reliably estimating uncertainties . for a given @xmath38 it finds the largest range of @xmath67 allowed by the data used in the global fit and the theoretical ansatz , independent of the approximations involved in the hessian method .",
    "the entire parameter space @xmath10 is explored in minimizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrange ] ) , not necessarily limited to the vicinity of the best fit @xmath68 . in practice , a large number of global fits is required to map out all @xmath5 profiles of interest .",
    "thanks to our novel monte carlo sampling technique to be described below , this is no longer a serious limitation computationally .",
    "the only drawback to this method is that it requires access to the full machinery of global fitting to estimate uncertainties of a given observable of interest , contrary to the hessian method for which the eigenvector pdf sets @xmath53 make it very simple to propagate pdf uncertainties to arbitrary observables .    in this paper ,",
    "lagrange multipliers will mainly be the method of our choice for estimating uncertainties and to monitor to what extent the approximations involved in the hessian approach are justified .      as is evident from the previous subsections",
    ", the extraction of pdfs in a global qcd analysis of a large body of data at nlo accuracy requires an extensive number of time consuming computations of the corresponding observables in each step of the @xmath5 minimization procedure .",
    "the large number of parameters specifying the functional form of the pdfs in the fit , typically of @xmath69 , and the need for a proper assessment of their uncertainties , add to this .",
    "assuming a representative analysis with about 500 data points , 5000 iterations to reach the optimum set of parameters , and a modest computing time of 1 second per cross section calculation at nlo , one easily realizes that computational improvements are very much in demand .",
    "we stress at this point that approximating nlo corrections by parameterizing them by a @xmath70-factor , @xmath71 , which is a possible strategy in the spin - averaged case in order to speed up the analysis  @xcite , is not a viable option in the polarized case . in the latter , the parton distributions as well as the hard scattering cross sections may have nodes and change sign within the kinematic region of interest . as a result , different partonic subprocess contributions can have very different nlo corrections that are never well approximated by a single @xmath70-factor .",
    "this problem is even more prominent at the present time when the spin - dependent parton distributions , in particular the gluon distribution , are still poorly known .",
    "also , from a more theoretical point of view , the nlo corrections are expected to decrease the factorization / renormalization scale dependence of the calculation . in the ideal case that the nlo cross section has relatively little scale dependence , this would imply that the @xmath70-factor inherits the full lo scale dependence and thus can not serve well as a proxy for the nlo corrections .",
    "we thus do not really see a useful workaround that would avoid inclusion of the full nlo calculation in the global analysis .",
    "the required numerical calculations also involve the scale evolution of the pdfs from some initial scale @xmath72 to each of the scales relevant for the data points .",
    "the evolution is governed by a well - known set of integro - differential equations  @xcite that can be solved analytically after an integral transform from bjorken @xmath1 space to complex mellin @xmath73-moment space .",
    "the mellin transform of a generic function @xmath74 depending on the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath1 is defined as @xmath75 and its inverse reads @xmath76 here @xmath77 denotes a suitable contour in the complex @xmath73 plane that has an imaginary part ranging from @xmath78 to @xmath79 and that intersects the real axis to the right of the rightmost pole of @xmath80 . in practice , it is beneficial to choose the contour to be bent at an angle @xmath81 towards the negative real-@xmath73 axis  @xcite . the integration in ( [ eq : invmellin ] ) can then be very efficiently performed numerically by choosing the values of @xmath73 as the supports for a gaussian integration .",
    "the transformation ( [ eq : mellin ] ) has the welcome property that convolutions factorize into ordinary products , which greatly simplifies calculations based on mellin moments .",
    "it can be carried out analytically not only for the splitting functions governing the scale evolution of the pdfs but even for the partonic hard scattering cross sections for both inclusive and semi - inclusive dis .",
    "the latter case requires straightforward extensions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mellin ] ) and ( [ eq : invmellin ] ) to double transformations as was discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this reflects the fact that sidis depends on two scaling variables , the momentum fractions @xmath1 and @xmath82 taken by the struck parton from the parent nucleon and by the final - state hadron from the scattered parton , respectively .",
    "the usefulness of the mellin technique was demonstrated in practice in a global analysis of helicity - dependent pdfs using all available dis and sidis data  @xcite .",
    "however , the inclusion of observables in hadron - hadron collisions or in less inclusive reactions in lepton - hadron scattering , which are crucial for determining , e.g. , the gluon distribution , require a more elaborate framework .",
    "they involve multiple convolution integrals between one or more pdfs , partonic cross sections , and , depending on the process , fragmentation functions .",
    "more importantly , they typically depend on several kinematic variables , so that there is no direct way of taking mellin moments of the cross section under which it would become a simple product of mellin moments of pdfs and partonic cross sections .",
    "an example is single - inclusive pion production in proton - proton collisions , @xmath83 , at measured transverse momentum @xmath84 and rapidity @xmath85 of the pion .",
    "while @xmath86 is the typical scaling variable of the process , taking mellin moments of the cross section in @xmath87 does not lead to a simple expression involving the moments of the pdfs .",
    "an efficient computational scheme that allows to circumvent this complication has been devised in ref .",
    "its main feature is to use the inverse mellin transforms of the pdfs in the theoretical expression , which makes it possible to store all numerically time consuming calculations involving the lengthy and complicated expressions for the underlying hard scattering cross sections on large `` look - up tables '' or `` grids '' in mellin moment space . here",
    ", we review the technique of  @xcite and describe a method to compute these grids very efficiently using monte - carlo sampling techniques .",

    "it is worth pointing out that these behaviors are not related to a lack of flexibility of the input parameterizations , but to features of the data itself .",
    "for example , the double minima observed for @xmath237 and @xmath238 are associated with two possible `` best - fit solutions '' to the pion sidis asymmetries , which show strong fluctuations .    in most cases ,",

    "we note that the behavior of @xmath287 at high @xmath1 will also be further addressed by experiments at jefferson lab after the 12  gev upgrade  @xcite .    for @xmath293 production , one has the following structure of the spin - dependent cross section  @xcite : @xmath294 here the distinction of the two contributions by considering large negative or positive lepton rapidities is less clear - cut than in the case of @xmath270 .",
    "for example , at negative @xmath267 the partonic combination @xmath295 will dominate , but at the same time @xmath276 so that the angular factor @xmath296 is small .",
    "likewise , at positive @xmath267 the dominant partonic combination @xmath297 is suppressed by the angular factor .",

    "nonetheless , the @xmath293 measurements at rhic will of course still be of great value .",
    "in fact , our global analysis technique is precisely suited for extracting information on the polarized pdfs even if there is no single dominant partonic subprocess .",
    "we have presented details of a recent study of the helicity parton distribution functions of the nucleon , which used experimental information available from inclusive and semi - inclusive polarized deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering and from polarized proton - proton scattering at rhic .",
    "the data sets were used jointly in a next - to - leading order global qcd analysis , which allows to extract the set of parton distributions that provides the optimal overall description of the data , along with estimates of its uncertainties . we have presented techniques and computational methods that speed up the next - to - leading order calculations for @xmath3 scattering to the level required in practice for a global analysis .",
    "our technique is formulated in mellin moment space .",
    "a key feature is that the computationally most challenging parts are done only once , prior to the fit .",
    "use of a monte - carlo sampling method allows us to perform this one - time calculation very efficiently .",
    "our extracted parton distributions show particularly interesting features in the sea quark and gluon sector .",
    "we find evidence for a mostly positive @xmath146 and a negative @xmath147 distribution , so that @xmath160 is positive .",
    "this behavior has been predicted by a number of models of nucleon structure .",
    "the polarized strange quark distribution @xmath167 comes out slightly positive at medium @xmath1 , which is driven by the semi - inclusive kaon dis data and could be subject to rather large systematic uncertainties .",
    "@xmath167 turns negative at @xmath299 as a result of constraints from su(3 ) symmetry , which have a relatively small nominal error .",
    "if true , this means that @xmath167 acquires its large negative integral essentially completely from the small-@xmath1 region . as a further consequence , quark and anti -",
    "quark spins combined contribute about a fourth to a third of the proton s spin , with the lower value arising if strange quarks and anti - quarks are indeed strongly negatively polarized at low @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we have found that the gluon helicity distribution @xmath197 is small in the region of momentum fraction accessed directly so far by rhic , with likely a node and an almost vanishing integral over that region .",
    "reliable statements about the full gluon spin contribution to the proton spin are presently not yet possible .",
    "we have performed uncertainty estimates for our polarized parton distributions , using both the lagrange multiplier technique and the improved hessian approach . to obtain these , a large number of additional fits are necessary , for which the computational techniques we have developed are particularly important .",
    "we find that both approaches yield consistent results for moderate departures from the best fit , typically @xmath149 . for larger @xmath38",
    ", significant differences develop as a result of departures from parabolic behavior of @xmath5 around its minimum .",
    "this implies that the hessian matrix method becomes unreliable .",
    "we have produced a set of 38 `` eigenvector '' parton distributions for the hessian method with @xmath149 @xcite , which may be used to estimate the uncertainty of any observable that depends on the distributions .",
    "we stress , however , that we presently prefer a more conservative choice of @xmath150 as a tolerance criterion for acceptable parton distributions .",
    "unfortunately , the behavior of @xmath5 around its minimum does not warrant use of the hessian method for producing eigenvector parton distributions in this case .",
    "we have used the @xmath149 eigenvector distributions to obtain predictions for spin asymmetries for high transverse momentum pion and jet production in polarized proton - proton collisions at 500  gev center - of - mass energy at bnl - rhic , as well as for @xmath0 boson production .",
    "the former would give information on @xmath196 at lower @xmath1 , while the latter would provide a clean new probe of the polarized quark and anti - quark distributions , which is important in view of the uncertainties inherent in semi - inclusive dis .",

    "<S> we discuss techniques and results for the extraction of the nucleon s spin - dependent parton distributions and their uncertainties from data for polarized deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon and proton - proton scattering by means of a global qcd analysis . </S>",
    "<S> computational methods are described that significantly increase the speed of the required calculations to a level that allows to perform the full analysis consistently at next - to - leading order accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we examine how the various data sets help to constrain different aspects of the quark , anti - quark , and gluon helicity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainty estimates are performed using both the lagrange multiplier and the hessian approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we use the extracted parton distribution functions and their estimated uncertainties to predict spin asymmetries for high - transverse momentum pion and jet production in polarized proton - proton collisions at 500  gev center - of - mass system energy at bnl - rhic , as well as for @xmath0 boson production . </S>"
