    "there is growing evidence in favor of magnetic driving in outflows associated with gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vk03a ; see also knigl s contribution in these proceedings ) .",
    "the dynamics of these outflows may be described to zeroth order by the ideal , axisymmetric , hydromagnetic equations , consisting of the maxwell and momentum equations together with the conservations of baryonic mass and specific entropy .",
    "vk03a demonstrated that , under the assumptions of a quasi - steady poloidal magnetic field and of a highly relativistic poloidal velocity , these equations become effectively time - independent and the motion can be described as a frozen pulse , generalizing the so - called `` frozen pulse '' approximation already known in purely hydrodynamic models of grb outflows @xcite . introducing the magnetic flux function @xmath2 ,",
    "the arclength along a poloidal streamline @xmath3 , and the operator @xmath4 that acts while keeping @xmath5 constant , the momentum equation can be written as ( see vk03a for details ) @xmath6 the large - scale electromagnetic field ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , the bulk flow speed ( @xmath9 ) , and the total ( @xmath10 radiation ) pressure can be written as functions of @xmath2 and the rest baryon density @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denote cylindrical and spherical coordinates , whereas subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote poloidal and azimuthal components , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath15 faraday s law and the conservations of specific entropy and mass imply that the functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are constants of motion , i.e. , functions of @xmath2 . by integrating equation ( [ mom ] ) along @xmath19 and @xmath20 one gets two additional constants of motion , @xmath21 describing the conservation of the ratio ( total energy flux)/(mass flux ) and of the total specific angular momentum , respectively .",
    "the remaining unknowns are the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the latter is the solution of bernoulli s equation [ which is obtained after substituting all quantities in the identity @xmath24 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) ] , whereas the former controls the shape of the poloidal streamlines and is the solution of the highly nonlinear transfield component of the momentum equation ( [ mom ] ) .",
    "vk03a integrated the last two equations under the @xmath25 self - similarity assumption @xmath26 , which makes it possible ( with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and constant @xmath29 , @xmath18 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) to separate the ( @xmath25 , @xmath32 ) coordinates .",
    "the resulting simplified set of ordinary differential equations can be easily integrated .",
    "two types of boundary conditions at the base of the flow were considered : ( 1 ) the case of a strong poloidal magnetic field @xmath33 , which corresponds to a trans - alfvnic outflow ( since the azimuthal field dominates asymptotically and the flow becomes super - fast ) .",
    "( 2 ) the case of a strong azimuthal field @xmath34 , which corresponds to a super - alfvnic flow .        )",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath36 , the ratio @xmath37 of the enthalpy to the rest energy , and the ratio of the poynting flux to the rest - energy flux ( _ top _ curve ) are shown as functions of @xmath38 along the innermost field line .",
    "( @xmath39 ) the meridional projections of the innermost and outermost field lines are shown on a logarithmic scale , along with a sketch of the central object / disk system .",
    "the field lines have a parabolic shape ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath41 cm and become asymptotically cylindrical .",
    "the vertical lines mark the positions of the various transition points along the innermost field line ( see text and * ? ? ?",
    "\\1 ) @xmath42 is the fireball phase .",
    "the specific enthalpy @xmath37 decreases , resulting in increasing @xmath43 ( @xmath44 const , a characteristic of hydrodynamic acceleration ) , while the specific poynting flux remains constant ( the field is force free ) .",
    "the electromagnetic field only guides the flow , with the bulk of the collimation occurring in this regime .",
    "\\3 ) @xmath47 is the asymptotic cylindrical regime .",
    "the final lorentz factor is of the order of the final specific poynting flux , meaning that @xmath48 of the total energy ( which was mostly electromagnetic initially ) is transformed into baryonic kinetic energy ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the solution presented in fig .",
    "1 describes one shell , corresponding to a particular value of @xmath50 . by specifying the @xmath50 dependence in the initial conditions",
    "one can examine a multiple - shell outflow and the time dependence of the pulse .",
    "for example , the @xmath50 dependence of the ( total energy)/mass flux ratio @xmath51 translates into different final lorentz factors for distinct shells : @xmath52 .",
    "in contrast with michel s solution @xcite , in which the classical fast magnetosonic point is located at infinity and @xmath53 , here this point is encountered at a finite height and most of the magnetic acceleration occurs further out , leading asymptotically to @xmath54 .",
    "thus , not only is the magnetic acceleration highly efficient , but the stronger dependence of @xmath55 on the initial conditions [ through @xmath56 can lead to a larger contrast in @xmath57 between successive shells and hence to a higher efficiency of internal shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      a representative super - alfvnic solution , corresponding to a base magnetic field ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , is shown in fig .",
    "the super - alfvnic solutions are distinguished from the trans - alfvnic ones in two main respects : ( 1 ) during the initial thermal - acceleration phase , some of the internal energy is transformed into electromagnetic energy even as another part is used to increase @xmath60 .",
    "( 2 ) during the subsequent magnetic - acceleration phase , the rate of increase of the lorentz factor with @xmath61 can be significantly lower than in the trans - alfvnic case ; the rate of increase of the jet radius with @xmath61 is correspondingly higher .",
    "the overall magnetic - to - kinetic energy conversion efficiency is higher .",
    "see @xcite for further details and analytic scaling relations .",
    "another potentially important aspect of super - alfvnic outflows , namely , the possibility that their initial composition is highly neutron - rich , could significantly alleviate the grb baryon - loading problem . in @xcite ( see also knigl s contribution ) it is shown that , in contrast to the purely hydrodynamic case , the neutrons can decouple at a lorentz factor that is over an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath64 for the protons ."
