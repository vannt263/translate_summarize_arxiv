    "one of the main findings in neuroscience is the modular organization of the brain which in turn implies the parallel nature of brain computations @xcite . for example , in the visual modality , more than thirty visual areas analyze simultaneously distinct features of the visual scene : motion , color , orientation , space , form , luminance and contrast among others @xcite .",
    "these features , as well as information from different sensory modalities , have to be integrated , as one of the main aspects of perception is its unitary nature @xcite .",
    "this leads to a basic conundrum of brain networks : modular processors have to be sufficiently isolated to achieve independent computations , but also globally connected to be integrated in coherent functions @xcite .",
    "a current view is that small - world networks provide a solution to this puzzle since they combine high local clustering and short path length @xcite .",
    "this view has been fueled by the systematic finding of small - world topology in a wide range of human brain networks derived from structural @xcite , functional @xcite , and diffusion tensor mri @xcite .",
    "small - world topology has also been identified at the cellular - network scale in functional cortical neuronal circuits in mammals @xcite and even in the nervous system of the nematode _ caenorhabditis elegans _ @xcite . moreover",
    ", small - world property seems to be relevant for brain function since it is affected by disease @xcite , normal aging and by pharmacological blockade of dopamine neurotransmission @xcite .",
    "while brain networks show small - world properties , several experimental studies have also shown that they are hierarchical , fractal and highly modular @xcite .",
    "as there is an intrinsic tension between modular and small - world organization , the main aim of this study is to reconcile these ubiquitous and seemingly contradictory topological properties . indeed",
    ", traditional models of small - world networks can not fully capture the coexistence of highly modular structure with broad global integration .",
    "first , clustering is a purely local quantity which can be assessed inspecting the immediate neighborhood of a node @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "modularity is a global property of the network , determined by the existence of strongly connected groups of nodes that are only loosely connected to the rest of the network @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is easy to construct modular and unclustered networks or , reciprocally , clustered networks without modules .",
    "second , the short distances of a small - world may be incompatible with strong modularity which typically presents the properties of a `` large - world '' @xcite characterized by long distances which effectively suppress diffusion and free flow in the system @xcite . while a clustered",
    "network preserves its clustering coefficient when a small fraction of shortcuts are added ( converting it into a small - world ) @xcite , the persistence of modules is not equally robust . as we show below , shrinking the network diameter may quickly destroy the modules .",
    "hence , the concept of small - world may not be entirely sufficient to explain the modular and integration features of functional brain networks on its own .",
    "we propose that a solution to modularity and broad integration can be achieved by a network in which strong links form large - world fractal modules , in agreement with @xcite , which are short - cutted by weaker links establishing a small - word network .",
    "a modified percolation theory @xcite can identify a sequence of critical values of connectivity thresholds forming a hierarchy of modules which progressively merge together .",
    "this proposal is inspired by a fundamental notion of sociology termed by granovetter as `` the strength of weak ties '' @xcite . according to this theory , strong ties ( close friends ) clump together forming modules .",
    "an acquaintance ( weak tie ) becomes a crucial bridge ( a shortcut ) between the two densely knit clumps ( modules ) of close friends @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this theme also emerges in theoretical models of large - scale cognitive architecture .",
    "several theories suggest integration mechanisms based on dynamic binding @xcite or on a workspace system @xcite .",
    "for instance , the workspace model @xcite proposes that a flexible routing system with dynamic and comparably weaker connections transiently connects modules with very strong connections carved by long - term learning mechanisms .",
    "we capitalize on a well - known dual - task paradigm , the psychological refractory period @xcite . a total of 16 subjects responded with the right hand to a visual stimulus and with the left hand to an auditory stimulus ( see si appendix ) .",
    "the temporal gap between the auditory and visual stimuli varied in four stimulus onset asynchrony , soa= 0 , 300 , 900 and 1200 ms .",
    "the sequence of activated regions which unfolds during the execution of the task has been reported in a previous study @xcite .",
    "the network analysis relies on the time - resolved bold - fmri response based on the phase signal obtained for each voxel of data @xcite .",
    "we first compute the phase of the bold signal for each voxel with methods developed previously @xcite . for each subject and each soa task",
    ", we obtain the phase signal of the @xmath0-th voxel of activity , @xmath1 , over @xmath2 trials performed for a particular soa value and subject .",
    "we use these signals to construct the network topology of brain voxels based on the equal - time cross - correlation matrix , @xmath3 , where a network link indicates a high cross - correlation in the phase activity of the two voxels ( see si appendix ) .",
    "the accuracy of the calculated @xmath3 values was estimated through a boot strapping analysis .",
    "the 95% confidence interval becomes more narrow for higher @xmath3 values , e.g. , for @xmath4 it is ( 0.9744 , 0.9760 ) .",
    "the corresponding standard deviation is of the order of 0.003 .",
    "thus , we typically distinguish between values that differ by 0.005 ( see si appendix and fig .",
    "s1 ) .    to construct the network , we link two voxels if their cross - correlation @xmath3 is larger than a predefined threshold value @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the resulting network for a given @xmath5 is a representation of functional relations among voxels for a specific subject and soa .",
    "we obtain 64 cross - correlation networks resulting from the four soa values presented to the 16 subjects .",
    "graph analyses of brain correlations relies on a threshold @xcite which is problematic since small - world like properties are sensitive to even a small proportion of variation in the connections .",
    "the present analysis may be seen as an attempt to solve this problem .",
    "the thresholding procedure can be naturally mapped to a percolation process ( defined in the @xmath6 space of interactions @xmath3 ) ; a model to describe geometrical phase transitions of connected clusters in random graphs , see chapters 2 and 3 in @xcite and @xcite .    in general",
    ", the size of the largest component of connected nodes in a percolation process remains very small for large @xmath5 .",
    "the crucial concept is that the largest connected component increases rapidly through a critical phase transition at @xmath7 , in which a single incipient cluster dominates and spans the system @xcite .",
    "a unique connected component is expected to appear if the links in the network are occupied at random without correlations . however , when we apply the percolation analysis to the functional brain network , a more complex picture emerges revealing a hierarchy of clusters arising from the non - trivial correlations in brain activity .    for each participant ,",
    "we calculate the size of the largest connected component as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the largest cluster size increases progressively with a series of sharp jumps ( fig .",
    "[ perco]a , soa=900 ms , all participants , other stimuli are similar ) .",
    "this suggests a multiplicity of percolation transitions where percolating modules subsequently merge as @xmath5 decreases rather than following the typical uncorrelated percolation process with a single spanning cluster .",
    "each of these jumps defines a percolation transition focused on groups of nodes which are highly correlated , constituting well - defined modules .",
    "figure [ perco]b shows the detailed behavior of the jumps in a typical individual ( subject labeled # 1 in our dataset @xcite , soa=900 ms ) . at high values of @xmath5 , three large clusters are formed localized to the medial occipital cortex ( red ) , the lateral occipital cortex ( orange ) and the anterior cingulate ( green ) . at a lower @xmath8 ,",
    "the orange and red clusters merge as revealed by the first jump in the percolation picture . as @xmath5 continues to decrease this mechanism of cluster formation and absorption repeats , defining a hierarchical process as depicted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ perco]b .",
    "this analysis further reveals the existence of `` stubborn '' clusters .",
    "for instance , the anterior cingulate cluster ( green ) , known to be involved in cognitive control @xcite and which hence can not commit to a specific functional module , remains detached from the other clusters down to low @xmath5 values . even at the lower values of @xmath5 , when a massive region of the cortex including motor , visual and auditory regions has formed a single incipient cluster ( red , @xmath9 ) , two new clusters emerge ; one involving subcortical structures including the thalamus and striatum ( cyan ) and the other involving the left frontal cortex ( purple ) .",
    "this mechanism reveals the iteration of a process by which modules form at a given @xmath5 value and merged by comparably weaker links .",
    "this process is recursive .",
    "the weak links of a given transition become the strong links of the next transition , in a hierarchical fashion .    here",
    ", we focus our analysis on the first jump in the size of the largest connected component , for instance , @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ perco]b .",
    "we consider the three largest modules at @xmath7 with at least 1,000 voxels each .",
    "this analysis results in a total of 192 modules among all participants and stimuli which are pooled together for the next study .",
    "an example of an identified module in the medial occipital cortex of subject # 1 and soa=900 ms is shown in fig .",
    "[ perco]c in the network representation and in fig .",
    "[ perco]d in real space .",
    "the topography of the modules reflects coherent patterns across the subjects and stimuli as analyzed in si appendix ( see fig .",
    "s2 ) .      to determine the structure of the modules we investigate the scaling of the `` mass '' of each module ( the total number of voxels in the module , @xmath11 ) as a function of three length - scales defined for each module : _ ( i ) _ the maximum path length , @xmath12 , _ ( ii ) _ the average path length between two nodes , @xmath13 , and _",
    "( iii ) _ the maximum euclidean distance among any two nodes in the cluster , @xmath14 .",
    "the path length , @xmath15 , is the distance in network space defined as the number of links along the shortest path between two nodes .",
    "the maximum @xmath12 is the largest shortest path in the network .",
    "figure [ fractal]a indicates power - law scaling for these quantities @xcite . for instance : @xmath16 defines the euclidean hausdorff fractal dimension , @xmath17 .",
    "the scaling with @xmath12 and @xmath18 is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) as seen in fig .",
    "[ fractal]a .",
    "the exponent @xmath19 quantifies how densely the volume of the brain is covered by a specific module .",
    "next , we investigate the network properties of each module , applying renormalization group ( rg ) analysis for complex networks @xcite .",
    "this technique allows one to observe the network at different scales transforming it into successively simpler copies of itself , which can be used to detect characteristics which are difficult to identify at a specific scale of observation .",
    "we use this technique to characterize sub - modular structure within each brain module @xcite .",
    "we consider each module identified at @xmath7 separately .",
    "we then tile it with the minimum number of boxes or sub - modules , @xmath20 , of a given box diameter @xmath21 @xcite , i.e. , every pair of nodes in a box has shortest path length smaller than @xmath21 . notice that the calculations are performed in network space , where path lengths are defined across the network links without the need for an embedding dimension .    covering the network with minimal @xmath20 sub - modules",
    "represents an optimization problem which is solved using standard box - covering algorithms , such as the maximum excluded mass burning algorithm , memb , which was introduced in @xcite to describe the self similarity of complex networks ranging from the www , biological and technical networks ( see si appendix and fig .",
    "[ fractal]b describing memb ; the code can be downloaded from @xcite ) . the requirement to minimize",
    "the number of boxes is important since the resulting boxes are characterized by the proximity between all their nodes and minimization of the links connecting the boxes @xcite .",
    "thus , the box - covering algorithm detects boxes / submodules that also tend to maximize modularity .",
    "the repetitive application of box - covering at different values of @xmath21 is a rg transformation @xcite that yields a different partition of the brain modules in submodules of varying sizes ( fig . [",
    "fractal]b ) .",
    "figure [ fractal]c shows the scaling of @xmath20 versus @xmath21 averaged over all the modules for all individuals and stimuli .",
    "this property is quantified in the power - law relation @xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the box fractal dimension @xcite which characterizes the self - similarity between different scales of the module where smaller - scale boxes behave in a similar way as the original network .",
    "the resulting @xmath24 averaged over all the modules is @xmath25 .",
    "the rg analysis reveals that the module topology does not have many redundant links and it represents the quantitative statement that the brain modules are `` large - worlds '' .",
    "however this analysis is not sufficient to precisely characterize the topology of the modules .",
    "for example , a two - dimensional complex network architecture and a simple two - dimensional lattice are compatible with the scaling analysis and the value of the exponents described in the previous section .    to identify the network architecture of the modules we follow established analysis @xcite based on the study of the degree distribution of the modules , @xmath26 , and the degree - degree correlation @xmath27 .",
    "the form of @xmath26 distinguishes between a euclidean lattice ( delta function ) , an erdos - renyi network ( poisson ) @xcite , or a scale - free network ( power - law ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the brain modules have a broad degree distribution @xcite with an approximate power - law @xmath28 .",
    "the statistical analysis provides strong evidence for a power law form and rules out exponential decay ( see si appendix ) . in fig .",
    "s4 we present a number of @xmath26 curves for different modules , along with their best fittings . in the si appendix",
    "we describe the calculation method that takes into account all the clusters and finally yields an average exponent @xmath29 .",
    "an ` average ' curve for the distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fractal]d , where the exponent @xmath30 is not a direct fit to this curve , but instead represents the result of the accurate calculation .",
    "this result indicates that the modules have a scale - free fractal structure , different from a simple two - dimensional lattice , where @xmath26 should be a narrow function .",
    "the embedding of scale - free networks in a finite - dimension real space constitutes a problem which has attracted recent attention @xcite .",
    "scale - free networks may arise from a 2-dimensional lattice with added dense connectivity locally , where the weights and connectivity are inversely proportional to the euclidean distance on the lattice . to investigate this possibility we study the correlation function of the phases of the voxels as a function of euclidean distance in real space : @xmath31 versus @xmath32 .",
    "this function can be interpreted as the correlation between two spins with orientation determined by the phase @xmath33 of the voxel at location @xmath34 ( average is over all pairs at distance @xmath35 ) .",
    "we find ( see si appendix and fig .",
    "s3 ) that @xmath36 decays algebraically with distance . thus ,",
    "our results indicate that modules are scale - free networks which can be embedded in a lattice with an added long - range connectivity .    how can fractal modularity emerge in light of the scale - free property , which is usually associated with small - worlds @xcite ? in a previous study @xcite , we introduced a model to account for the simultaneous emergence of scale - free , fractality and modularity in real networks by a multiplicative process in the growth of the number of links , nodes and distances in the network .",
    "the dynamic follows the inverse of the rg transformation @xcite where the hubs acquire new connections by linking preferentially with less connected nodes rather than other hubs .",
    "this kind of `` repulsion between hubs '' @xcite creates a disassortative structure with hubs spreading uniformly in the network and not crumpling in the core as in scale - free models @xcite .",
    "hubs are buried deep into the modules , while low degree nodes are the intermodule connectors @xcite .",
    "a signature of such mechanism can be found by following hubs degree during the renormalization procedure . at scale @xmath21 ,",

    "scaling theory defines precise relations between the exponents for fractal networks @xcite , through @xmath43 . for the case of brain modules analyzed here ( fig .",
    "[ fractal]e ) , we find @xmath44 . using the values of @xmath24 and @xmath41 for the brain clusters , the prediction is @xmath45 , which is close to the calculated value of @xmath29 from fig .",
    "[ fractal]d .",
    "the previous analysis reveals the mechanism of formation of a scale - free network , but it does not assure a fractal topology .",
    "fractality can be determined from the study of the degree - degree correlation through the distribution , @xmath27 to find a link between nodes with @xmath46 degree .",
    "this correlation characterizes the hub - hub repulsion through scaling exponents @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( see si appendix and fig .",

    "taken together , these results indicate a scale - free fractal morphology of brain modules .",
    "such structure is in agreement with previous results of the anatomical connectivity of the brain @xcite and functional brain networks @xcite .",
    "standard modularity decomposition methods @xcite based on maximization of the modularity factor @xmath53 as defined in @xcite are particularly suitable to uncover the submodular structure .",
    "for example , the girvan - newman method @xcite yields a value of @xmath54 for the brain clusters , indicating a strong modular substructure .",
    "the box covering algorithm benefits from detecting submodules ( the boxes ) at different scales .",
    "then , we can study the hierarchical character of modularity @xcite , and detect whether modularity is a feature of the network that remains scale - invariant ( see si appendix and fig .",
    "s6 for a comparison of the submodular structure obtained using girvan - newman and box covering ) .",
    "the minimization of @xmath20 guarantees a network partition with the largest number of intramodule links and the fewest intermodule links .",

    "the observation of such an organization in brain networks suggests that it may be a ubiquitous natural solution to the puzzle of information flow in highly modular structures .    over the last decades",
    ", wire length minimization arguments have been used successfully to explain the architectural organization of brain circuitry @xcite .",
    "minimizing wire length is in fact of paramount importance , since about 60% of the cortical volume is taken up by wire ( axons and dendrites ) @xcite .",
    "this turns out to optimize conduction rate , posing a strict packing limitation of the amount of wire in cortical circuits @xcite .",
    "our finding of a distribution of weak links which minimizes wiring cost is hence in line with a previous literature , consistently showing that neural circuit design is under pressure to minimize wiring length .",
    "however , some important nuances of the specific optimization procedure ought to be considered .",
    "first , we specifically showed that at the mesoscopic scale , short - cut distribution optimizes wiring cost while maintaining network proximity .",
    "this is consistent with the organization of large - scale neural networks in which total wiring can in fact be decreased by about 32% ( in 95 primate cortical areas ) and up to 48% in the global neuronal network of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans @xcite .",
    "this extra wiring cost comes from long - range connections which achieve network benefits of shortening the distance between pairs of nodes @xcite .",
    "our results are in agreement with this observation , suggesting that simultaneous optimization of network properties and wiring cost might be a relevant principle of brain architecture . in simple words",
    ", this topology does not minimize the total wire per - se , simply to connect all the nodes ; instead it minimizes the amount of wire required to achieve the goal of shrinking the network to a small - world .",
    "a second intriguing aspect of our results , which is not usually highlighted , is that this minimization assumes that broadcasting and routing information are known to each node .",
    "how this may be achieved what aspects of the neural code convey its own routing information remains an open question in neuroscience .",
    "bold fmri is an indirect measure of brain activity which relies on multiple vascular and biophysical factors which couple the neural response to the haemodynamic signal @xcite .",
    "even if in fmri research it is always assumed that haemodynamic signals reflect metabolic demand generated by local neuronal activity , recent studies have shown reliable haemodynamic signals that entrains to task structure independently of standard neural predictors of haemodynamics @xcite .",
    "hence , our results , as any other fmri analysis , have to be taken cautiously and may partly reflect the underlying structure of vascular motives . specifically , the human cortical vascular system has a large number of arterial anastomoses which show a seemingly looking fractal structure in the mm to cm range @xcite .",
    "precise measurements of fractality have been reported at the micrometer scales in volumes of the order of a few mm@xmath102 @xcite , which corresponds to approximately a voxel volume , where branching structure of microcapilarities then generates fractals .",
    "hence , it is possible that the fractal organization of brain modules is inherited from the vascular system itself .",
    "although we can not readily test the influence of the vascular system at a large scale , it is still possible to address this concern at a microscopic scale , by discarding neighboring correlations .",
    "neighboring voxels are expected to carry some shared signal due to spatial autocorrelations from the microvascular network . to assure that our results do not rely on neighbouring correlations which might be particularly spurious , we coarse - grained the original fmri signal by doubling the lattice spacing , reducing the number of voxels by a factor of 8 and repeat the calculations .",
    "the results are consistent with the percolation picture of fractal modules , albeit with an expected lower @xmath7 .",
    "such a renormalized @xmath7 is expected from renormalization theory to change under coarse - graining , while the main results on long - range links , such as the value of the exponents , are insensitive to this type of coarse - graining .",
    "we also investigate whether the map of fractal dimension @xmath24 reflects a meaningful organization based on known facts of functional properties of the cortex and the specific task which subjects are performing .",
    "we found a topographical organization of fractality in the human brain ( fig .",
    "the right portion of the anterior cingulate , sma and the right ppc regions involved in routing of information and cognitive control @xcite , which are expected to have a more complex functional organization , are the clusters with higher fractal dimension .",
    "the left - right asymmetry is interesting since , in this specific task , the left hand response is queued for a few hundred millisencods and has to be temporally connected to working memory and inhibitory circuits . while not fully conclusive , this analysis suggests a functional role of the network architectures described here .",
    "another similar concern is that the recovered brain modules may be a manifestation of the fractal structure of the underlying three - dimensional vortex grid or of the cortex .",
    "however , since the dimensions of the grid ( @xmath103 ) and of the cortex ( @xmath104)@xcite are both sufficiently different from 1.9 and the connectivity distribution of the modules is much broader than the typical euclidean fractal cortex ( which should be narrow around @xmath105 ) or a 3d lattice ( @xmath106 ) , we may safely assume that these objects have their own structure .",
    "moreover , we also observed modules with similar fractal dimension in subcortical structures suggesting that these results do not simply reflect anatomical properties of the cortical mantle .",
    "a hierarchical modular organization of the brain composed of modules within modules has been invoked in @xcite to describe the brain structure .",
    "the present results support these previous findings , while , at the same time , provide a new view by integrating the results with the ( non - critical ) properties of small - worlds and placing self - similarity in the framework of scaling theory , universality and renormalization groups @xcite .",
    "in this framework , brain modules are characterized by a set of novel scaling exponents , the septuplet : @xmath107 , and the scaling relations @xmath108 , relating fractality with modularity , @xmath101 , relating global integration with modularity , @xmath43 , relating scale - free with fractality , and @xmath109 , relating degree correlations with fractality .",
    "one advantage of this formalism is that the different brain topologies can be classified into universality classes under rg @xcite according to the septuplet @xmath110 .",
    "universality applies to the critical exponents but not to quantities like @xmath111 which are sensitive to the microscopic details of the different experimental situations @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "( non - critical ) small - worlds are obtained in the limit @xmath112 .",
    "a path for future research will be to test the universality of the septuplet of exponents under different activities covering other areas of the brain , e.g. , the resting - state correlation structure @xcite .    in conclusion , we propose a formal solution to the problem of information transfer in the highly modular structure of the brain .",
    "the answer is inspired by a classic finding in sociology : the strength of weak ties @xcite .",
    "the present work provides a general insight into the physical mechanisms of network information processing at large .",
    "it builds up on an example of considerable relevance to natural science , the organization of the brain , to establish a concrete solution to a broad problem in network science .",
    "the results can be readily applied to other systems where the coexistence of modular specialization and global integration is crucial ranging from metabolic , protein and genetic networks to social networks and the internet .",

    "starting from these centers as box origins , we then simultaneously burn the boxes from each origin until the entire network is covered , i.e. each node is assigned to one box ( we call this process burning since it is similar to burning algorithms developed to investigate clustering statistics in percolation theory [ 29,30 ] ) . in fig .",
