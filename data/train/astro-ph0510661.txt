    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ has confirmed that x - ray emission from large - scale jets is common in radio galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , harris & krawczynski  2002 ; kataoka & stawarz  2005 , and references therein ) . in nearby fr",
    "i sources , the typical radio - to - x - ray spectrum of kpc - scale jet knots is consistent with a single , smoothly broken power - law continuum , suggesting that this broadband emission is entirely due to nonthermal synchrotron radiation from a single electron population ( e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "2001 for 3c66b ) , although spatial offsets observed in these sources between the positions of the x - ray and radio knots may indicate a more complicated physical picture . meanwhile , the observed x - ray knots in hundred - kpc  scale quasar jets are much brighter than expected from a simple extrapolation of the radio - to - optical fluxes ( e.g. , schwartz et al .  2000 for pks0637@xmath3752 ) .",
    "this has led to the hypothesis that the x - ray production involved inverse - comptonization of cmb photons within a highly relativistic flow ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 , celotti et al .",
    "it has been argued , however , based on recent studies of multi - wavelength properties of powerful large - scale jets , that the inverse - compton model may face serious problems ( see , e.g. , the discussion in stawarz et al .  2004 ; kataoka & stawarz  2005 )",
    ". moreover , the inverse - compton model can not readily explain the detected x - ray emission from a few fr  ii jets  pictor  a ( wilson et al .",
    "2001 ) , 3c303 ( kataoka et al .",
    "2003 ) , 3c120 ( harris et al.2004 ) , 3c403 ( kraft et al .",
    "2005 )  since they are expected to be the @xmath4-@xmath5 analogues of the radio - loud quasars .",
    "therefore , the synchrotron origin of the kev photons remains a plausible alternative even for powerful fr  ii / quasar jets .",
    "the synchrotron model for x - ray emission from the large - scale jets in radio galaxies ( fr  i / fr  ii ) and quasars involves much lower bulk velocities for the flows , but on the other hand requires the presence of ultra - relativistic electrons with energies @xmath6tev .",
    "this requirement is supported in a natural way by the expectation that the large scale jets are good candidates for the the acceleration of cosmic ray particles owing to their large , extended structures and turbulent nature ( see hillas  1984 ) . from the theoretical perspective",
    ", it has been proposed that the most energetic particles are accelerated preferentially in the turbulent boundary layers of such outflows ( ostrowski  2000 ; stawarz & ostrowski  2002 ; see also in this context rieger & duffy  2004 and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the ` limb - brightened ' jet morphology expected in this type of models has been observed at radio frequencies ( probing relatively low electron energies ) in several objects , such as m87 ( fr  i , owen et al .",
    "1989 ) and 3c353 ( fr  ii , swain et al .",
    "more importantly , the continuous acceleration processes acting thereby should result in the formation of flat spectra at the highest electron energies , which may account for the hard x - ray spectra and high x - ray luminosities of powerful jet sources .",
    "similarly , dermer & atoyan ( 2002 ) suggested the formation of high - energy spectral hardening owing to inefficient klein - nishina radiative losses of electrons , which also could appear at x - ray energies for some particular choices of jet parameters .",
    "therefore the investigations of ( 1 ) the transverse structure of x - ray jets , and ( 2 ) the spectral properties of diffuse x - ray jet emission , provide important clues for an understanding of the production of cosmic ray particles and the origin of hard x - ray emission in large scale jets .",
    "unfortunately , only few such studies have been reported so far , mainly due to the technical difficulties .",
    "in fact , it is generally impossible to resolve jets in low power fr  i radio galaxies or distant quasars , even with the excellent spatial resolution ( 0.5@xmath0 half power diameter on - axis ) and sensitivity of _ chandra _ ( see _ proposers observatory guide v.7 _ ) .",
    "centaurus  a ( hereafter cen  a ) is the nearest active galaxy ( @xmath7mpc , for which 1@xmath0 corresponds to 16pc ) and has been well studied across the entire electromagnetic spectrum at the highest linear spatial resolution ( israel  1998 ) .",
    "it is considered to be a prototypical fr  i radio galaxy , although the one - sidedness of its kpc - scale jet and the presence of the outer , mpc - scale radio lobes is unusual for this type of object .",
    "previous observations of cen  a have resulted in the detection of a bright x - ray and radio jet extending @xmath84@xmath9 northeast of the nucleus ( schreier et al .",
    "1979 , 1981 ; clarke et al .  1986 , 1992 ; kraft et al .  2002 ; hardcastle et al .",
    "2003 ) . from the analysis of the broadband radio  to  x - ray jet emission , the synchrotron origin of kev photons has been established for the bright knots , which are characterized by a minimum pressure @xmath10dyn@xmath11 , equipartition magnetic field @xmath12@xmath13 g and @xmath14kev luminosities of the order of @xmath15ergs@xmath16 . in addition , a very complex morphology of the whole outflow was noted in both the radio and x - ray bands , including the presence of bright filaments and diffuse extended regions with complex sub - structure .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission clearly extends to the edge of the radio jet and is reasonably well matched to the radio emission on these scales .",
    "moreover , hardcastle et al .  (",
    "2003 ) noted two conspicuous regions where the extended x - ray emission appeared to be associated with the edges of the jet , and to be absent in the center .",
    "these x - ray edges of the jet have no obvious radio counterparts , although clarke et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1992 ) also reported a limb - brightened radio morphology in some sections of the jet .",
    "we note that these radio polarization studies indicated a projected magnetic field parallel to the jet axis along the whole jet length .",
    "stimulated by these previous reports , the goal of this work is twofold , namely determining the transverse profile of the diffuse x - ray emission extending over the cen  a jet , and constraining its spectral properties .",
    "our approach differs from previous studies in that we focus on the diffuse emission rather than the bright jet knots , which are thought to be compact shocks inside the jet ( hardcastle et al .",
    "we remove the contributions from the knots , as particle acceleration may take place in quite different manners in different jet regions ( but we will revisit this problem later in the discussion section ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in @xmath172 , we describe the _ chandra _ observations , data reduction process and our analysis method . in @xmath173 , we present the results of the data analysis . in @xmath174 , we discuss our findings in the context of particle acceleration models , presenting our conclusions in @xmath175 .",
    "since the launch of _ chandra _ x - ray observatory in july 1999 , x - ray observations of cen  a have been conducted 10 times , three of which were for calibration ( cal ) purposes , and the remaining for general observer ( go ) or guaranteed time observing ( gto ) proposals .",
    "the first _",
    "chandra _ x - ray image of cen  a was obtained with the microchannel plate x - ray imaging detector hrc - i ( obs i d 463 , 1253 , and 1412 ) , and the results presented in kraft et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . the first useful spectral information was subsequently presented based on observations using the acis - i configuration ( obs i d 316 and 962 : kraft et al .",
    "the exposure times for the two observations were 35.9ksec and 36.5ksec , respectively .",
    "although the jet was 4@xmath35@xmath9 off - axis from the aim point in these observations , and the image resolution was therefore significantly degraded , 31 knots in the cen  a jet were successfully detected .",
    "more recent _ chandra _ observations of cen  a were made in 2002 september ( obs i d 2978 ) and 2003 september ( obs i d 3965 ) using the standard acis - s configuration , where the back - illuminated s3 chip was focused to obtain maximal sensitivity to soft photons .",
    "the exposure times for the two observations were 45.2ksec and 50.2ksec , respectively .",
    "the active nucleus was at the aim point , resulting in both sub - arcsecond resolution and good spectral sensitivity for the whole inner part of the jet in cen  a. although the imaging degrades substantially for sources more than 1@xmath9 off - axis , and the x - ray jet in cen  a extends over @xmath184@xmath9 in length , the encircled energy for a point source is contained within a diameter of @xmath183@xmath0 all along the outflow .",
    "the roll angle of the satellite was carefully chosen to avoid the readout streak of the bright nucleus impinging on the jet image .",
    "the results from the first observation , obs i d 2978 , are given in hardcastle et al .",
    "the x - ray image was compared with new , high dynamic range vla images for one - to - one identification of radio knots , for which apparent sub - luminal motions were found ( on scales of hundreds of pc ) . here",
    "we analyze the combined acis - s data ( obs i d 2978 and 3965 ) to obtain the best image resolution and spectral information reported to date .    a co - added , exposure - corrected image of the cen  a jet in the 0.4@xmath38kev bandpass is shown in figure  1 ( _ upper _ ) .",
    "the image is smoothed with a @xmath19=0.5arcsec gaussian function .",
    "the nucleus is located in the southwest corner of the image , and the jet extends to the northeast .",
    "the figure shows that the diffuse emission from the jet is observed up to @xmath18 4@xmath9 from the nucleus .",
    "also , the _ chandra _ image shows that the x - ray jet consists of many knots of enhanced emission embedded within the diffuse regions , as described in detail by kraft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . since the primary purpose of this paper is to study the characteristics of the _ diffuse _ x - ray emission associated with the jet ,",
    "our approach is complementary to previous reports in the literature : we first resolve the point - like sources within the jet ( in projection ) .",
    "next we subtract the contributions from these point sources to enable a quantitative measurement of the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "one may ask if the remaining emission is truly diffuse in nature , or whether it is the summation of numerous unresolved jet - knots at even smaller spatial scales . we will revisit this problem in @xmath173.3 , based on the luminosity function of the jet - knots .    using a wavelet decomposition source - detection algorithm ( _ wavdetect _ ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "1995 ) to detect emission enhancements on angular scales of 0.5@xmath0 and 1@xmath0 , we find a total of 35 distinct knots or enhancements of x - ray emission embedded within the diffuse regions .",
    "we then extend the angular scales to 2@xmath0 and 4@xmath0 , but only an additional six sources are found in these larger region sizes .",
    "this suggests that most of the jet knots in cen  a are very compact and that their extent is smaller than , or comparable to , that expected from the _ chandra _ point spread function .",
    "our result is therefore consistent with findings by kraft et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who claimed that most of the x - ray knots are diffuse but at the 1@xmath0 ( @xmath1810pc ) level .",
    "due to the good photon statistics and excellent angular resolution during the observations , the total number of the detected sources is significantly larger than that reported in the literature ( i.e. , 41 compared with 31 for kraft et al .",
    "three of the weaker knots reported in kraft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , nx1 ( knot-1 ) , ex3 ( knot-19 ) , and fx4 ( knot-23 ) , were not detected at the previous level in our high resolution , co - added acis - s image .",
    "the location , distance and position angle of the 13 knots or enhancements which were newly detected in our analysis are listed in table  1 .",
    "we next apply _ dmfilth _ implemented in the ciao 3.2 package to replace the pixel values for the point sources detected by _ wavdetect _ with values interpolated from surrounding background regions ( dist option in _ dmfilth _ ; see _ science threads for ciao 3.2 _ ) . here",
    "the source regions are defined as the ellipses output from _ wavdetect _ which contain at least a 3@xmath19 excess of photon counts over the background .",
    "the background is taken from the `` doughnut '' shaped region surrounding the source , with the dimensions of the major and minor axes of the outer ellipse both doubled .",
    "the resultant image is almost flat , as expected , but contains a few irregular pixels with outstanding photon counts .",
    "this is because , in some regions , source ellipses overlap .",
    "the background region for a certain point source therefore inevitably contains photons from neighboring source regions .",
    "we therefore repeat the same process ( i.e. , source detection by _ wavdetect _ and smoothing by _ dmfilth _ ) three times , until no irregular bins appeared in the image .",
    "the resultant x - ray image of the diffuse emission is given in figure  1 ( _ bottom _ : 0.4@xmath38.0kev ) .",
    "we also made bandpass images for soft x - rays ( 0.4@xmath31.5kev ) and hard x - rays ( 1.5@xmath38.0kev ) using the same procedure .",
    "in order to derive the intensity ( photon counts ) profile of the jet both in the longitudinal and transverse directions , we first define the position angle ( @xmath20 ) and the distance ( @xmath21 ) with respect to the nucleus of cen  a as shown in figure  1 ( _ bottom _ ) . note that the position angle is measured from east through north ( i.e. , in a clockwise direction in the figure ) .",
    "then we can integrate the photon counts in a sector of an arbitrary range of @xmath21 and @xmath20 , to construct the intensity profile parallel or perpendicular to the jet main axis , which is given by @xmath22 .",
    "since our approach is simply to sum the counts in each sector bounded by the stated values of @xmath21 and @xmath23 , and not to derive the emissivity , no normalization by the area of each sector ( @xmath24 @xmath25 ) was performed .",
    "we first integrate the photon counts in each thin shell within a radial distance @xmath21 @xmath18 @xmath21+@xmath26 over the range of position angle 25@xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath20 @xmath28 45@xmath27 , and then construct the longitudinal intensity profile in @xmath26=4@xmath0 steps , from @xmath21=0@xmath0 to 250@xmath0 .",
    "figure  2 shows the longitudinal jet profiles thus produced , for both soft x - rays ( 0.4@xmath31.5kev : _ top _ ) and hard x - rays ( 1.5@xmath38.0kev : _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the dotted histograms show the profiles derived from the raw x - ray images , whereas those for the diffuse x - ray emission are given as the data points on the solid - line histogram .",
    "we also show the intensity profile of the background ( i.e. , off - jet ) region as a dashed line for comparison , where the background was accumulated in the 15@xmath29 and 45@xmath30 regions .",
    "the intensity profiles along the jet are quite different in the two energy bands , especially at the innermost part of the jet ( 0@xmath31 ) , where the soft x - ray photons are significantly absorbed in the dust lane crossing the cen  a host galaxy .",
    "to see this more clearly , we divided the 1.5@xmath38.0kev longitudinal jet profile by that of the 0.4@xmath31.5kev , to check for hardness variations along the x - ray jet .",
    "figure  3 compares the hardness ratio ( hr ) and the 0.4@xmath38.0kev x - ray intensity profile .",
    "one can clearly see that hr changes significantly at @xmath32 , corresponding to a linear scale of @xmath18 800pc . obviously , such a dramatic change of the hr is not due to the changes of intrinsic jet spectrum .",
    "in fact , we can see that the hr changes in a similar way for the background region also , as shown by the dashed line in the bottom panel .",
    "the inner 1kpc of the jet is observed through the dust lane of the galaxy , making detection of any optical component difficult ( israel  1998 ) .",
    "this same dust lane , or equatorial gas , heavily absorbs soft x - rays as well , resulting in the significant changes of the hardness ratio seen in figure  3 . in the outer part of the jet ( 50@xmath33 ) ,",
    "the hr is almost constant .",
    "this trend suggests that the x - ray spectrum does not change significantly along the jet , but the contribution from the background photons must be carefully examined before reaching this conclusion .    to find possible spectral changes along the jet , we fit the diffuse emission with a power - law function in xspec , for each shell in @xmath34=10@xmath0 steps between 10@xmath0 and 100@xmath0 , and 20@xmath0 steps between 100@xmath0 and 240@xmath0 .",
    "we do not examine the innermost part of the jet ( @xmath35 ) because the x - ray emission from the nucleus significantly contaminates the jet emission there .",
    "@xmath28 10@xmath0 ) of the jet .",
    "see fig .  2 for a comparison of background profile with the diffuse jet emission profile .",
    "] we take the background from neighboring shells just outside the jet ( 15@xmath27@xmath28@xmath20@xmath2825@xmath27 , 45@xmath27@xmath28@xmath20@xmath2855@xmath27 at the same range of @xmath21 ) and subtract it from the source spectrum .",
    "the result of spectral fitting along the jet is shown in figure  4 .",
    "as expected from the hardness profile , the x - ray spectrum clearly changes at a characteristic distance of @xmath36 @xmath37 50@xmath0 . in the inner jet region ( @xmath38 ) , the spectrum is well represented by a power - law function heavily absorbed with a free zero - redshift absorbing column .",
    "a combined spectrum between @xmath39 and 50@xmath0 gives the best - fit absorbing column density of @xmath40 = ( 4.79@xmath41)@xmath4210@xmath43@xmath11 and an intrinsic energy spectral index of @xmath44 = 0.89@xmath45 , where the reduced @xmath46 is 0.50 for 164 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the absorption column in the outer region ( @xmath21 @xmath8 @xmath36 ) is much smaller , and similar to the galactic column density ( @xmath180.7@xmath4210@xmath43@xmath11 ) .",
    "although there is a weak trend of spectral steepening at larger distances from the nucleus , there is no sudden change in the spectral form over the wide distance of @xmath47 and 240@xmath0 .",
    "the subtle anti - correlation between the fitted x - ray spectral index and the x - ray flux which can be seen in figure  4 is most likely due to minor variation of the fitted absorbing column density at @xmath48 .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the average spectrum in this outer jet region are @xmath40 = ( 0.96@xmath490.13)@xmath4210@xmath43@xmath11 and @xmath44 = 1.19@xmath490.07 , which have a reduced @xmath46 of 0.88 for 267 dof .",
    "this energy spectral index of the diffuse emission inside the jet is consistent with that reported in hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , viz , @xmath40 = ( 1.1@xmath490.3)@xmath4210@xmath43@xmath11 and @xmath44 = 1.00@xmath50 , derived for the extended jet emission in the jet between knot a2 and the knot b region ( approximately 20@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 70@xmath0 ) , excluding all compact x - ray features .",
    "interestingly , in the 100kpc - long jet in the radio galaxy pictor  a , the observed x - ray spectral index is constant along the jet , and is @xmath44 @xmath18 1 ( wilson et al .",
    "2001 ) , as in the kpc - scale jet analyzed here , suggesting the action of similar particle acceleration processes for the high - energy electrons resulting in the synchrotron x - ray emission .",
    "we next integrate the photon counts in each narrow sector with an angular width @xmath51 over certain radial distances ( selected in the range 50@xmath0@xmath28@xmath21@xmath28250@xmath0 ) , and then construct the transverse intensity profiles in @xmath51=1@xmath27 steps , from @xmath20=20@xmath27 to 50@xmath27 .",
    "we do not examine the innermost part of the jet ( @xmath21@xmath2850@xmath0 ) because of the strong absorption due to the dust lane , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "moreover , we can not determine the position angle @xmath20 in the inner - jet region with sufficient accuracy .",
    "for example , the @xmath181@xmath0 diameter of a typical _ chandra _ image resolution corresponds to @xmath51@xmath81@xmath27 at @xmath21@xmath2850@xmath0 , which is larger than the angular step size of @xmath52=1@xmath27 for our analysis . note that @xmath52=1@xmath27 at @xmath21=250@xmath0 corresponds to @xmath534.4@xmath0 , or to a linear scale of @xmath54pc .",
    "figure  5 shows the transverse jet profiles thus produced for both soft x - rays ( 0.4@xmath31.5kev : _ top _ ) and hard x - rays ( 1.5@xmath38.0kev : _ bottom _ ) .",
    "we made separate plots of the transverse profiles for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , because the jet s emission decreases to the background level at 170@xmath0 , but then gradually increases again to a peak at @xmath57 ( see figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the dotted histograms show the profiles derived from the raw x - ray images , whereas those for the diffuse x - ray emission are given as the data points on the solid - line histogram .",
    "the transverse jet profile of the diffuse emission shows a flat - top structure for the jet region between 50@xmath0 and 170@xmath0 but , in contrast , a single , narrow peak for the outermost part of the jet ( 170@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 250@xmath0 ) .",
    "such an edge - brightened structure , as observed for the inner jet region , is not readily apparent in the asymmetric intensity profile derived from the raw data .    the flat - topped intensity profile along the transverse jet direction in cen  a can not be explained by a homogeneous plasma fluid moving with a uniform velocity .",
    "one natural and simple possibility to account for the observed profile is to consider a stratified model for the kpc - scale cen  a jet , with a velocity shear across the jet outflow .",
    "in general , such a structure is actually required to explain many observed properties of extragalactic jets , and is also expected on the grounds of theoretical and numerical jet studies ( see the discussion in stawarz & ostrowski  2002 and references therein ) . in this model ,",
    "different doppler enhancements of the emission produced within different velocity components can result in the observed limb - brightening of the jet .",
    "the other possibility discussed in the literature is to consider a mildly - relativistic jet bulk velocity and the enhanced emissivity of the non - thermal plasma at the jet boundaries resulting from , e.g. , non - uniform radial structure of the jet magnetic field due to jet interaction with surrounding medium or some particular large - scale magnetic topology ( see , e.g. , the discussion in owen et al .",
    "because of the apparent one - sidedness of the kpc - scale jet in cen  a , we favor the former possibility as the dominant factor shaping the transverse intensity profile , although both doppler favoritism and plasma emissivity stratification may both play a role . the exact velocity profile across the kpc - scale jet in cen  a can not be precisely modeled with the present data .",
    "let us however underline a few appropriate constraints .",
    "first , note that the observed parallel magnetic field structure along the jet axis , with no evidence for the transverse component that is usually observed in fr  i sources , is consistent with a well - developed velocity shear ( see in this context laing & bridle  2002 ) .",
    "second , if the limb - brightening of the diffuse x - ray emission is predominantly due to varying doppler enhancements of different jet axisymmetric layers , and the emissivity is @xmath58 along the jet ( although this may not be a realistic assumption for a stratified jet ) , a component for which the emission is most strongly beamed toward the observer is the one characterized by the bulk velocity @xmath59 ( or bulk lorentz factor @xmath60 ) , where @xmath61 is the jet viewing angle . with the preferred @xmath62 ( tingay et al .",
    "1998 ; kraft et al .  2003 ) , one can roughly estimate the bulk velocity of the limb - brightened regions ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) as @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) .",
    "this very rough , illustrative estimate indicates that the spine of the kpc - scale jet in cen  a  at the position angle @xmath67  is most likely still relativistic , with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath68 . in this context , the single narrow peak at the outermost part of the jet ( 170@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 250@xmath0 ) , may correspond to the spine , decelerated significantly at the terminal part of the collimated outflow .",
    "finally we note that the half - opening angle of the x - ray jet , @xmath69 , is smaller than that of the radio jet structure @xmath70 for @xmath71 ( clarke et al .  1992 ; see also kraft et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the framework of the above discussion",
    ", this would be consistent with the boundary shear layer spreading in the transverse direction as the jet propagates .",
    "similar to the analysis in the longitudinal direction , we divided the 1.5@xmath38.0kev transverse jet profile by that of the 0.4@xmath31.5kev , to examine the hardness ratio ( hr ) variation across the x - ray jet .",
    "figure  6 compares the hr and the 0.4@xmath38.0kev x - ray intensity profiles .",
    "here we divided the inner jet region further into three separate sectors , ( a ) 50@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 80@xmath0 , ( b ) 80@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28",
    "120@xmath0 , and ( c ) 120@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 170@xmath0 , for a detailed comparison of changes in transverse profile .",
    "edge - brightened structure is most clearly seen in the profile derived for 50@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 80@xmath0 ( figure  6a ) .",
    "interestingly , one can clearly see that the hr is almost uniform across the jet , but shows a weak sign of enhancement at the very edges of the x - ray jet regions ( @xmath20 @xmath18 25@xmath27 and @xmath20 @xmath18 45@xmath27 ) , followed by a sudden `` drop '' ( softening ) close to the edges .",
    "similar hardening or softening may explain some variation of the hr even for the jet - edges in figure  6 ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we may speculate that the spectrum changes considerably at the outer edges of the jet , accounting for these variations , though the present data do not allow this to be established .",
    "first , since the hr contains a significant contribution from background photons , apparent changes in hr might be due to variation in the background characteristics rather than changes in the source spectrum itself .",
    "this effect is important especially at the jet edges , where the emission is dominated by background photons .",
    "we will carefully examine this problem later by choosing an appropriate background for spectral fitting .",
    "second , it is well known that the response of the _ chandra _ x - ray mirror changes with the incident x - ray energy .",
    "the half - power diameter of the point spread function is 0.5@xmath0 at 1kev , but slightly worse at higher energies ( e.g. , 1@xmath0 at 5kev ; see _ the proposers observatory guide_. such an energy dependence of the angular resolution might introduce hr variations perpendicular to the cen  a jet , especially at the jet edges . to check for this effect",
    "quantitatively , we smoothed the 0.4@xmath38.0kev image ( figure  1 _ bottom _ ) with gaussian functions of @xmath19 = 0.5@xmath0 and 1.0@xmath0 to mimic the images obtained in different energy bands .",
    "the resultant intensity profiles have only negligible ( less than 2@xmath72 ) changes in the hr across the jet , suggesting that we can not explain the observed hard x - ray features shown in figure  6 by this effect alone .    finally , variations of hr may be caused by any possible artifact caused by _",
    "dmfilth _ and inclusion of background .",
    "we therefore remove all the point sources detected by _",
    "wavdetect _ and fit the diffuse emission with a power - law function in xspec , without filling the ` holes ' remaining after subtracting the source ellipses .",
    "we assume a fixed absorption column density of @xmath40 = 0.96@xmath4210@xmath43@xmath11 , which is valid all along the jet if @xmath21 @xmath8 50@xmath0 ( see @xmath173.1 ) .",
    "we take the background from two sectors just outside the jet ( 19@xmath27@xmath28@xmath20@xmath2823@xmath27 , 47@xmath27@xmath28@xmath20 @xmath2851@xmath27 within an equal @xmath21 @xmath18 @xmath21+@xmath73@xmath21 ) and subtracted them from the source spectrum .",
    "the result of spectral fitting across the jet with @xmath52=2@xmath27 steps is shown in figure  7 .",
    "although the photon counts are inevitably poor at the jet edges , the general trends of the flux variations and spectral changes are very similar to that expected from the hr profiles . the spectral index seems to increase slightly and gradually along the main jet , being @xmath44 @xmath8 1.0 .",
    "in addition , the hardest x - ray spectra are observed at the edges of the jet in the 50@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 80@xmath0 region , where @xmath44 = 0.23@xmath74 for @xmath20@xmath1825@xmath27 or @xmath44 = 0.40@xmath75 for @xmath20@xmath1845@xmath27 .",
    "we note that the background spectrum is approximately represented by a power - law with an energy spectral index of @xmath44 @xmath18 1.5@xmath32.0 , and therefore background contamination can not produce an x - ray spectrum as hard as that as observed in figure 7(a ) .",
    "unfortunately , the photon statistics are insufficient to confirm that the x - ray spectrum is actually harder at the very edges of the jet .",
    "nevertheless , this provides an important motivation for future deep observations of the cen  a jet .      as pointed out by kraft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the x - ray morphology of the cen  a jet is much more complex when observed at higher spatial resolution .",
    "this raises the question whether some fraction of the extended emission discussed in this paper can be explained by the pile - up of small scale knots below the resolution limit for _ chandra _ point source detection . to estimate",
    "what part of the remaining unresolved emission of the jet could indeed result from a large number of unresolved low luminosity compact features , we construct a luminosity function ( lf ) for the already resolved jet - knots , presented in figure  8 .",
    "here we consider the 32 jet - knots located between 50@xmath0 and 250@xmath0 as the strong absorption due to the dust lane makes determination of the unabsorbed luminosity quite uncertain for @xmath21 @xmath28 50@xmath0 .",
    "we assume a power - law energy spectrum with the spectral index @xmath44 = 1.0 ( hardcastle et al.2003 ; kraft et al .",
    "2002 ) and @xmath40 = 0.96@xmath4210@xmath43@xmath11 ( see @xmath173.1 ) to estimate the 0.55kev luminosities of the knots . although kraft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived their lf for 0.110kev luminosities of the knots with a different choice of spectral parameters ( @xmath76 = 2.3 and @xmath40 = 1.7@xmath4210@xmath43@xmath11 ) , a rough conversion to their 0.110kev fluxes can be obtained by multiplying our 0.55kev luminosities by a factor of three .",
    "the limiting sensitivity for this analysis is somewhat uncertain due to source confusion and possible variations of spatial extent among the jet - knots .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity of the observation varies across the field of view due to the telescope vignetting and variations in the psf .",
    "a detailed computation of the limiting sensitivity requires a monte carlo simulation taking into account the unknown morphology of the _ intrinsic _ diffuse emission and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we follow the simplified method adopted by kraft et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : we use the measured background and the telescope psf at the edge of the field of view and we require a 4@xmath19 measurement of the count rate . our conservative estimate ( using the background map and the telescope vignetting ; kraft et al .",
    "2001 ) provides a sensitivity limit of @xmath77 @xmath18 4@xmath4210@xmath78erg s@xmath16 .",
    "let us briefly discuss this value . during these observations",
    "the encircled energy of a point source is contained within a diameter of @xmath183@xmath0 all along the jet .",
    "assuming that the intrinsic spatial extent of the knots is less than 4@xmath0 , we conservatively expect that all the compact sources can be detected within a circle of @xmath18 6@xmath0 diameter , even if they are in the outermost part of the jet ( i.e. , @xmath8 4@xmath9 off axis with respect to the mirror focus ) .",
    "the typical background within this region is @xmath1815  cts from the observational data . to detect a knot at the required statistical level",
    ", we therefore need @xmath1825 net source counts excluding the background photons .",
    "this corresponds to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath77 = 2@xmath4210@xmath78erg s@xmath16 .",
    "if a similar knot is embedded in extended emission ( as observed in 50@xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 80@xmath0 ) , @xmath1850 net photons are required over the @xmath18120 background photons .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume @xmath77 = 4@xmath4210@xmath78erg s@xmath16 in the following discussion .    in figure  8",
    ", the hatched region shows where our sampling is incomplete and somewhat biased .",
    "the overall lf is well modeled by a broken power - law , with the power - law slope flatter below the break .",
    "the dashed line on figure  8 shows the fit considered hereafter , where the power - law slope ( @xmath79 of @xmath80 @xmath24 @xmath81 ) flattens significantly from @xmath79 = 1.4 to 0.5 below @xmath82 @xmath37 9@xmath4210@xmath78erg s@xmath16 .",
    "the maximum likelihood method of crawford , jauncey & murdoch ( 1970 ) , using separate data sets below and above the break , supports this fit with an uncertainty ( defined here as a standard deviation ) of @xmath19@xmath370.4 for each @xmath79 .",
    "however , due to the limited number of the detected jet - knots ( 24 for @xmath83 @xmath8 4@xmath4210@xmath78erg s@xmath16 ) , the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) indicates that a single power - law model with @xmath79@xmath180.7 is also statistically acceptable .",
    "even so , a single steep power - law with @xmath79 @xmath8 1.0 can be rejected at the @xmath8490% confidence level .",
    "assuming further that the distribution of knot luminosities extends down to some minimum value @xmath85 , the integrated total x - ray luminosity can be evaluated quantitatively for both the resolved and the unresolved jet - knots ( see kraft et al .",
    "2002 for the detailed formalism ) .",
    "we note that the total luminosity of the cen  a jet ( i.e. , the sum of the jet - knots and the unresolved diffuse emission ) is 1.6@xmath4210@xmath86erg s@xmath16 .",
    "meanwhile , by integrating the lf down to any value of @xmath87 we get @xmath88 8.1@xmath4210@xmath89erg s@xmath16 , at most , if we assume the `` best - fit '' broken power - law lf described above . note that this is only 25@xmath72 larger than the sum of the _",
    "already resolved _",
    "jet - knots .",
    "the situation is almost unchanged if we take a single power - law function with @xmath79@xmath370.7 for the lf .",
    "we therefore conclude that about half of the total jet emission , @xmath90 @xmath18 8@xmath4210@xmath89erg s@xmath16 , is truly diffuse in nature .",
    "we finally consider an apparent discrepancy between our results and previous reports .",
    "kraft et al .  ( 2002 ) suggested that the diffuse x - ray emission of the cen  a jet may be entirely explained by unresolved knots only if @xmath85 = 3@xmath42 10@xmath91ergs@xmath16 and there is no break in the lf below the sensitivity limit of @xmath77 @xmath183@xmath4210@xmath92erg s@xmath16 ( corresponding to @xmath83 @xmath181@xmath4210@xmath92erg s@xmath16 in our lf ) .",
    "there are several possibilities to account for this discrepancy .",
    "first , the sensitivity limit adopted in kraft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is calculated for a single @xmath1835ksec observation . as discussed in detailed in kraft et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the sensitivity is limited by the source luminosity , not by the background , over the most of the field of view . therefore , our analysis based on the co - added acis - s image ( 95ksec exposure in total ) provides a factor of @xmath18@xmath93 deeper sensitivity for the source detection .",
    "moreover , the psf in the inner jet is a factor of @xmath182 smaller than previous observations ( see @xmath172 ) , which further improves the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "second , by applying the same sensitivity limit as kraft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , it would be difficult to see a flattening in the low - luminosity part of the lf .",
    "thus , a steep power - law lf is consistent with the work of kraft et al .",
    "( 2002 ; who obtained @xmath79=1.1 ) , although is implausible when the low - luminosity range ( @xmath83 @xmath88 10@xmath92erg s@xmath16 ) is taken into account .",
    "third , it seems that quite different conclusions can be reached for different choices of @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , integration of the lf down to arbitrarily small @xmath85 approaches infinity if @xmath79 @xmath8 1 .",
    "future deep observations of the cen  a jet are therefore strongly encouraged , although it seems to us reasonable that a significant fraction of the x - ray jet emission in this source is actually diffuse .",
    "the observed x - ray spectral index of the diffuse emission within the whole jet  including both the central flow and the limb - brightened edges  is steep , @xmath44 @xmath37 1.01.2 .",
    "the implied energy distribution of the x - ray synchrotron emitting electrons therefore has to be @xmath94 with @xmath95=3.03.4 , where @xmath96 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "such a spectrum is very similar to the one observed in the compact knots , which are believed to be the sites of shock waves , suggesting that the same , or a similar , particle acceleration process is acting in both regions . in the case of the shock acceleration",
    ", however , one expects the energy spectral index of the freshly accelerated electrons to be @xmath97=2.0 in the strong non - relativistic regime , or @xmath97@xmath982.0 when relativistic plasma velocities are considered ( see , e.g. , kirk & duffy  1999 , ostrowski  2002 ) .",
    "thus , if first order fermi shock acceleration is indeed responsible for formation of the x - ray ( synchrotron ) emitting electrons within the cen  a jet , the observed particle energy spectrum  both within and outside the resolved knots  has to be already modified by the ( dominant ) synchrotron losses , i.e. , the spectral index of freshly accelerated high - energy electrons has to be increased by the radiative cooling @xmath99 to @xmath100 ( the ` strong cooling regime ' with homogeneous magnetic field @xmath101 ; see kardashev  1962 ) .",
    "in fact , the appropriate cooling timescale is very short , @xmath102yrs ( for a jet magnetic field",
    "@xmath103 g @xmath18 1 , an observed synchrotron photon energy @xmath104kev @xmath18 1 , and a jet doppler factor @xmath105 ) , consistent with this interpretation .",
    "we note in this context that the detailed analysis of the radio emission from a number of fr  i sources of young et al.(2005 ) revealed a ` universal ' injection spectral index for the radiating electrons of @xmath97 = 2.1 , in accordance with the above discussion .",
    "we also note that synchrotron cooling within a non - uniform magnetic field can result in a spectral break larger than the standard one discussed above , @xmath106 ( e.g. , bicknell & begelman1996 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the very short synchrotron lifetime and the extended character of the diffuse x - ray jet component discussed here indicate that the appropriate acceleration process for the x - ray emitting electrons can not be connected exclusively with the localized compact knots of the kpc - scale jet , but instead has to operate effectively throughout the whole jet volume .",
    "indeed , the maximum propagation length of the jet electrons emitting 10kev synchrotron photons within the 100@xmath13 g jet ( equipartition ) magnetic field can be estimated as @xmath107pc for @xmath108 , which clearly indicates the need for the continuous acceleration of the radiating electrons in between the compact knots .",
    "let us mention at this point , that the analysis of the expected @xmath96-ray emission from kpc - scale fr  i jets presented by stawarz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggests that sub - equipartition magnetic fields ( which could increase @xmath109 ) are not likely in these objects . the problem could disappear if many small scale",
    "strong _ shocks are present ( below the flux resolution limit for our point source detection ) , possibly generated at the supersonic and highly turbulent jet boundary layer . however , as argued in the previous section , based on the constructed luminosity function for the resolved jet - knots , the observed extended x - ray emission is most likely truly diffuse in nature , and not just the pile - up of the unresolved compact knots .    a physical process which can naturally account for the distributed continuous acceleration of the radiating electrons within the whole jet volume consists of interaction of the particles with turbulent mhd waves . indeed , by applying quasi - linear theory for particle - wave interactions ( see , e.g. , schlickeiser 1989 )",
    ", one can find that with a reasonable set of physical parameters for the cen  a jet , the available maximum energies of the electrons accelerated in this way may be high enough to alow for efficient production of the synchrotron x - rays .",
    "on the other hand , the resulting electron energy spectrum is expected to be very flat : with a one - dimensional power spectrum of alfvnic turbulnce @xmath110@xmath24@xmath111 and a ` typical ' range of turbulence spectral index @xmath112  usually obtained in phenomenological models for the astrophysical mhd turbulence ( see , e.g. , the recent review by muller & biskamp  2003 , and references therein )  the steady - state solution for the momentum diffusion equation is a power - law with @xmath113 between 0 and 1 ( see , e.g. , borovsky & eilek 1986 or park & petrosian 1995 ) . however , the observed x - ray spectral index of the diffuse component of the cen  a jet is steep , requiring an electron energy slope of @xmath114 . in particular",
    ", taking the expected injection spectrum with @xmath97 either 0 or 1 , the strong ( synchrotron ) cooling regime condition gives an observed electron energy index of @xmath115 in both cases ( see aharonian  2002 ) , or an expected x - ray power - law slope @xmath116 , i.e. , much flatter than observed .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the quasi - linear theory for particle - wave interactions is of limited applicability for physical conditions within extragalactic jets , which may be highly turbulent , even with a possibly dynamically important pressure due to ultra - relativistic particles at the jet boundary ( see ostrowski 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , the expected large ratio of the escape to the radiative losses time scales within the jet ( see stawarz & ostrowski  2002 ) means that the stationary solution may not be realizable due to accelerated particle back - reaction , or that the turbulent diffusion could dominate the escape process . in such cases",
    "the quasi - linear approach may no longer be valid .",
    "in addition , radiative effects within a non - uniform magnetic field can modify the high - energy part of the electron energy distribution in a non - trivial way .",
    "a set of such problems is under investigation .",
    "our analysis indicates the possible presence of hard x - ray features within the outer ( fragmentary ) sheath of the cen  a kpc - scale jet , extending beyond the x - ray limb - brightened jet edges .",
    "the x - ray spectral properties of the outer jet boundaries are most probably very different from the ones characterizing the central jet flow .",
    "in particular , the observed x - ray spectral index can be as flat as @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the physical connection of these regions to the main flow is not clear , although they do roughly coincide with the edges of the radio structure .",
    "one may note in this context that detailed studies of the extragalactic radio jets using the ` spectral tomography ' technique has also revealed the presence of some features along the outer jet boundaries .",
    "in particular , katz - stone & rudnick  ( 1997 ) showed that the large - scale jet in the fr  i radio galaxy 3c449 , for which the radio spectral index @xmath117 is roughly constant along the whole jet , is surrounded by a steep - spectrum radio ` sheath ' . also , large - scale jets in the fr  ii radio galaxy cygnus  a are placed in the edge - brightened ` channels ' , which are consistent with the enhancement of radio - emitting electrons at the outer jet boundaries ( katz - stone & rudnick  1994 ) .    unfortunately , the present x - ray data are not sufficient to convincingly demonstrate the presence of a hard sheath around the cen  a jet .",
    "let us however mention briefly a possible scenario which can account for formation of such hard features , namely synchrotron emission of the high - energy electrons which lose energy predominantly due to inverse - compton radiation in the klein - nishina regime ( hereafter ` ic / kn ' process ; see aharonian & ambartsumyan 1985 ; dermer & atoyan 2002 ; kusunose & takahara 2005 ; khangulian & aharonian 2005 ; moderski et al .",
    "an interesting aspect of this scenario is that the observed electron spectrum can be flatter than the injected one , with the asymptotic power - law slope @xmath118 .",
    "let us therefore assume that the acceleration process similar to the one operating within the jet acts also within the outer boundaries of the outflow , where the magnetic field intensity is possibly lower than within the jet .",
    "thereby the high - energy electrons cool partly due to the synchrotron emission , producing x - ray photons , but mostly due to the ic / kn radiation at @xmath96-ray frequencies .",
    "the dominant ic / kn process thus flattens the injected electron spectrum , leading to the observed flat x - ray ( synchrotron ) continuum .",
    "the lorentz factor of electrons emitting 0.1kev synchrotron photons is @xmath119 .",
    "hence , the required energy of the seed photons to be upscattered by these electrons in the kn regime is @xmath120ev . at the same time",
    ", the energy density of the seed photons has to be @xmath121erg@xmath122 in order to ensure the dominance of the ic / kn losses . taking the lowest expected value @xmath123 ,",
    "this already excludes the cosmic microwave background radiation as the source of seed photons .",
    "however , cen  a is a giant elliptical galaxy known for its strong infrared emission : @xmath124jy at @xmath125@xmath13 m ( knapp et al .",
    "assuming that all of this radiation is produced within @xmath126kpc from the galactic center ( see israel 1998 ) , one can obtain a rough estimate for the energy density of the galactic @xmath127ev photons at the position of the kpc - scale cen  a jet , @xmath128erg@xmath122 , close to the average value for giant ellipticals , @xmath129erg@xmath122 , found by stawarz et al .  ( 2003 ) .",
    "note that this is about two orders of magnitude lower than the expected energy density of the @xmath130@xmath13 m starlight energy density ( stawarz et al .",
    "2003 ) . also , the energy density of the synchrotron infrared emission of the nuclear jet in cen  a can be important in this respect . in particular , taking the observed synchrotron luminosity of the cen  a nuclear jet @xmath131ergs@xmath16 and its critical observed synchrotron frequency @xmath132hz ( chiaberge et al .",
    "2000 ) , one gets the appropriate energy density as measured by a stationary observer located on the jet axis at @xmath126kpc from the active center @xmath133erg@xmath122 , and the appropriate critical frequency @xmath134ev , for the expected bulk lorentz factor of the nuclear jet @xmath135 ( see stawarz et al .  2003 ) .",
    "relative enhancement of synchrotron emission produced within a structured relativistic jet may constitute an alternative / additional source of the seed infrared photons ( see in this context ghisellini et al .",
    "thus , we conclude that if only the magnetic field in the outer sheath of the kpc - scale cen  a jet is @xmath136@xmath13 g can the suggested hard x - ray emission result from synchrotron radiation of the high energy electrons characterized by the standard initial spectrum @xmath137 , which cool mainly by comptonization of the nuclear jet emission ( and also the starlight photon field ) in the kn regime .- ray flux of the outer sheath implied by this model , @xmath138 erg @xmath11 s@xmath16 , is well below the sensitivity limits of current cherenkov telescopes . ]",
    "we have presented an analysis of the diffuse x - ray emission from the kpc - scale jet in centaurus  a. we found that the extended emission is most likely diffuse in nature rather than being the summation of unresolved compact sources and that it exhibits a relatively flat - topped intensity profile with a steep , uniformly distributed spectral index of @xmath139 , similar to those observed in the compact knots .",
    "we interpret the observed x - ray morphology in terms of a stratified jet model , consisting of a relativistic outflow with an expanding turbulent boundary shear layer .",
    "we argue that the observed x - ray spectrum of this diffuse component , consistent with the synchrotron emission produced in the strong cooling regime , requires continuous acceleration of ultra - relativistic electrons within the whole jet volume .",
    "we also note that the jet may be ( partially ) surrounded by an outer sheath with a very hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "both the presence and origin of this feature are unclear : we suggest that it forms in a turbulent region just outside the jet , separating the main outflow from the external medium , where the conditions for the radiative cooling processes are different from the ones characterizing the jet .",
    "although the present data do not allow us to unequivocally demonstrate the presence of the hard outer sheath , or to determine the appropriate particle acceleration mechanism acting within ( and possibly outside ) the outflow , our analysis indicates that ( 1 ) the jet structure is more complex than that visible on the intensity maps alone , and ( 2 ) the acceleration and spectral evolution of the radiating particles may be governed by many different processes ( including those such as magnetic field reconnection which we have not discussed ) , linked to the complex magneto - hydrodynamical configuration of the outflow .",

    "<S> we construct the luminosity function for the detected jet - knots and argue that the remaining emission is most likely to be truly diffuse , rather than resulting from the sum of many unresolved fainter knots . </S>",
    "<S> we subtracted the contributions of the bright knots from the total x - ray jet flux , and show that the remaining extended emission has a relatively flat - topped intensity profile in the transverse jet direction , with the intensity peaking at the jet boundaries between 50@xmath0 and 170@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that limb - brightened morphologies have been observed previously at radio frequencies in a few fr  i and fr  ii jet sources , but never so clearly at higher photon energies . </S>",
    "<S> our result therefore supports a stratified jet model , consisting of a relativistic outflow including a boundary layer with a velocity shear . </S>",

    "<S> we discuss this spectral behavior within a framework of shock and stochastic particle acceleration processes , connected with the turbulent , supersonic , and non - steady nature of the relativistic outflow . </S>",
    "<S> we note some evidence for a possible spectral hardening at the outer sheath of the jet , and manifesting itself in observed x - ray spectra of @xmath2 in the most extreme cases . due to the limited photon statistics of the present data , further deep observations of centaurus  </S>",
