    "some years ago , the materials science took an important step forward by obtaining the fabrication of small conducting devices known as quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite . in those devices , it is possible to confine several thousand electrons in a small region whose linear size is about @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fundamental characteristic of qds is that they are typically formed by a two - dimensional electron gas , where , by applying an electrostatic potential , the electrons are confined to a small region , which is called dot , in the interface region of a semiconductor .",
    "a very important advantage of qds is that their transport properties are readily measured , allowing an experimental control .",
    "moreover , the effects of time - reversal symmetry breaking can be easily measured by applying a magnetic field @xcite . nowadays",
    ", a variety of theoretical and experimental research about small conducting devices , such as qds , has been the focus of many scientists and engineers attention prb1,prb2,pre1,prl1 . from a phenomenological viewpoint ,",
    "qds are very small structures , where the laws of quantum mechanics ( qm ) are the most important ingredients to describe their properties .",
    "thus , as  a natural consequence of practical applicability of the theoretical framework of qm , a great interest arises for exact solutions of two - dimensional confined systems , which can be fundamental to explore the physics in small conducting devices , such as the qds . in the light of these facts",
    ", it was shown in ref . @xcite",
    "that it is possible to find exact solutions of the two - dimensional schrdinger equation with the position - dependent mass ( pdm ) for the square well potential in the semiconductor quantum dots ( sqds ) system .",
    "another important work in this context , it was presented by schmidt , azeredo , and gusso schmidt - azeredo - gusso , where the authors have studied both the problems of quantum wave packet revivals on two - dimensional infinite circular quantum wells ( cqws ) and circular quantum dots ( cqds ) with pdm , showing the results for the eigenfunctions , eigenenergies and the revival time for spatially localized electronic gaussian wave packets . at this point , it is important to highlight that the importance in adding a pdm is due to the fact that the system will take into account the spatial variation of the semiconductor @xcite .",
    "however , as consequence of inclusion a pdm , the system becomes ambiguous at the quantum level , and the ordering ambiguity problem ( oap ) is one of the long standing unsolved questions in quantum mechanics . as we know",
    "the oap has attracted the attention of some of the founders of the quantum mechanics , namely , born , jordan , weyl , dirac and von newmann worked on this problem , as can be verified from the review by shewell @xcite .",
    "this is viewed as a deep problem in qm , which has advanced very few along the last decades .",
    "but all is not lost , it was shown that the ordering ambiguous problem has a very special importance for the modeling of some experimental situations like electrons in perturbed periodic lattices @xcite , impurities states and cyclotron resonance in semiconductors @xcite , the structure of electronic excitation levels in insulating crystals @xcite ,  the dependence of nuclear forces on the relative velocity of the two nucleons @xcite , and more recently the study of semiconductor heterostructures @xcite . moreover ,",
    "some time ago , it was discussed in the literature the exact solvability of some classes of one - dimensional hamiltonians , where the potentials has a pdm , with ordering ambiguity @xcite , after that , a large number of works regarding one - dimensional hamiltonians with ordering ambiguity has emerged in the scientific community along the last few years m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,jpa2006 .",
    "another interesting research line regards to the supersymmetry approach to one - dimensional quantum systems with spatially - dependent mass , by including their ordering ambiguities dependence @xcite . on the other hand , as far as we know , some physical systems like ones where a magnetic field is present @xcite , lead naturally to the necessity of a two - dimensional analysis . in the face of this situation ,",
    "it was presented in ref.@xcite a general approach for the problem of a particle with pdm interacting with a two - dimensional potential well with finite depth , where the ordering ambiguity was taken in account . in that work",
    ", it was shown that the considered system retain an infinite set of quantum states , which usually do not happens in the case of the constant mass systems .",
    "furthermore , it was verified also that the su(2 ) coherent state corresponds to a stationary state .",
    "also recently , numerous other theoretical studies have been conducted on two - dimensional position - dependent mass schrdinger equation ( pdmse ) .",
    "these include the two - dimensional quantum rotor with two effective masses @xcite , kinetic operator in cylindrical coordinates @xcite , exact solutions for the pdmse in an annular billiard with impenetrable walls cc3 , and a particle with spin 1/2 moving in a plane @xcite .    here",
    ", we will address the position - dependent mass ( pdm ) type of the systems in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) by using cartesian coordinates .",
    "we will introduce a very interesting system where , as we are going to see below in the manuscript , the relation between the quantum numbers introduced along the procedure of resolving the equations of the system and the energy eigenstates organization is somewhat remarkable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ,",
    "we review the effective schrdinger equation in two - dimensional cartesian coordinates . in section",
    ", we introduce the position - dependent massive particle with morse - like terms and its exact solutions . in section",
    ", we present our conclusions and directions for future work .",
    "in this section , we will recapitulate the results presented some years ago in ref .",
    "let us start with the ordering defined by von roos @xcite for the hamiltonian operator , which in one - dimensional space is written in the following form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the momentum operator and @xmath3 is the position - dependent effective mass .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary ordering parameters which must to obey the relation @xmath6    at this point , it is important to highlight that the above relation is necessary to get the correct classical limit .    applying the canonical commutation relations ,",
    "we have    @xmath7    through the relation ( [ eq2b ] ) , the effective hamiltonian operator pla2000 is given by    @xmath8    where the effective potential @xmath9 is written as    @xmath10 .",

    "we can now write the effective schroedinger equation in the form    @xmath11 \\frac{d\\psi}{dx}+[v(x)+u(\\alpha,\\gamma , x)-e]\\psi=0 .   \\label{eq2ww}\\ ] ]    in the case of a set of two - dimensional cartesian coordinates , where @xmath12 , the effective hamiltonian operator    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the effective potential . now it can be written in the form @xcite",

    "there , it was discovered that the system retains an infinite set of quantum states . in the next section ,",
    "we explore the problem where the pdm is morse - like .",
    "an important problem in quantum mechanics is that one related to the vibrations of diatomic molecules , and the case of vibrations of a two - atomic molecule are well described by the morse potential . on the other hand",
    ", there is a growing number of applications of quantum wells and quantum dots .",
    "in fact , those systems present a small spatial region capable to confine quantum particles . as one can see in figure 1 , the bidimensional morse - like potential can simulate such kind of physical situation and it has the advantage , as we will see below , of being exactly solved .",
    "furthermore , having the exact solutions in hands , one can use them in order to describe more realistic problems by using approximation techniques which make use of those exact solutions .",
