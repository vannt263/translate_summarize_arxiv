    "knowledge of the evolution of energy levels with doping in strongly correlated systems is of significant importance for understanding the physical mechanisms leading to their unconventional properties .",
    "for example , information about the changes in the ground state energy of model electron systems ( such as hubbard model ) upon electron or hole doping may be used to confirm or disprove hypotheses about the origin of the pairing mechanism , eventually leading to superconductivity . as accessing this information",
    "analytically usually requires the use of various approximations , numerical techniques are often the only tools which can provide unbiased estimates for the observables of interest .",
    "we have recently applied the auxiliary field quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) on a c@xmath0 molecule to extract the electronic binding energies @xcite .",
    "afqmc has been widely used in hubbard hamiltonian simulations since its introduction by blankenbecler _",
    "@xcite , and its further development by hirsch @xcite and white _ et al .",
    "being a finite - temperature technique , afqmc does not allow easy access to the physical observables , not represented by thermodynamic averages , such as energy gaps .",
    "a convenient procedure to extract this additional information from the afqmc data was proposed by dagotto _",
    "@xcite , who introduced imaginary chemical potentials in afqmc simulations .",
    "it was then used to extract the charge gaps of the one - band hubbard model on finite two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattices .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize this formalism to systems without particle - hole symmetry , such as the tetrahedron , truncated tetrahedron and c@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the canonical partition function ratios are obtained from the expansions of the afqmc determinant ratios for a set of finite temperatures @xmath1 , which are subsequently used to extract charge gaps at low temperatures .",
    "this generalization results in the appearance of an extra phase factor in the expansion of the determinant ratios , which reduces to unity in the particle - hole symmetric systems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we briefly describe the imaginary chemical potential qmc ( icpqmc ) formalism",
    ". then simulation results on some hubbard molecules are presented to illustrate our method .",
    "the results are compared with the data obtained by exact diagonalization ( ed ) on small molecules and projector qmc ( pqmc ) on larger ones .",
    "we start with an expansion of the grand canonical partition function @xmath2 in terms of canonical partition functions @xmath3 @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inverse temperature , @xmath6 is the chemical potential , @xmath7 is the deviation of the particle number from half - filling ( positive or negative , denoting electron or hole doping , respectively ) in canonical ensemble , @xmath8 is the electron number operator , and @xmath9 is the number of spatial lattice sites in the system .",
    "@xmath10 is the usual one - band hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath11 the summation in the hopping term @xmath12 is performed over all nearest - neighbor pairs of the hubbard molecule . for the c@xmath0 molecule we have set @xmath13 for the links between the pentagons and hexagons and @xmath14 for the links between hexagons . in all other cases",
    "@xmath12 was set equal to @xmath15 for all links , with @xmath15 used as an energy unit .",
    "@xmath16 is the on - site coulomb repulsion ( hubbard ) term , and an extra diagonal term has been added to the hamiltonian so that @xmath17 corresponds to half - filling on bipartite lattices .",
    "following dagotto _",
    "@xcite , we analytically continue eq .",
    "( [ gcexpand ] ) to imaginary chemical potential @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is real .",
    "then the inverse fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ gcexpand ] ) gives @xmath20 in afqmc the grand canonical partition function is given by @xmath21\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\{\\sigma\\}}\\det o(\\{\\sigma\\},\\mu)_{\\uparrow}\\det o(\\{\\sigma\\},\\mu)_{\\downarrow } , \\label{zfinal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fermion degrees of freedom have been traced out , and the @xmath22 matrices are defined as @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{vls}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 is the imaginary time discretization interval and @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the original problem of taking a trace over fermionic degrees of freedom has been replaced by a problem of tracing over auxiliary ising variables @xmath26 , introduced at every space - time point @xmath27 .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ zfinal ] ) into eq.([zinverse ] ) , we get @xmath28    c +    c +   +    dividing eq .",
    "( [ zinverse1 ] ) by @xmath29 from eq .",
    "( [ zfinal ] ) yields @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the probability distribution for @xmath33 .",
    "since there is always an energy gap above and below half - filling for any finite system , we expect the fermion determinants to be nearly @xmath19-independent at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , we can generate the ising field configurations @xmath34 for @xmath35 and use these configurations to calculate system properties at @xmath36 .",
    "similar to the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ gcexpand ] ) , we expect that the determinant ratio @xmath37 in eq.([biglambda ] ) can be expressed as complex fourier series in the particle number @xmath7 @xmath38\\cos(\\beta\\lambda n)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + i\\sum_{n=1}^n[c_n(\\{\\sigma\\})-c_{-n}(\\{\\sigma\\})]\\sin(\\beta\\lambda n ) , \\label{detexpand}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 ( @xmath39 ) represents a doping of @xmath7 electrons ( holes ) with respect to half - filling .",
    "( [ detexpand ] ) is real for systems with particle - hole symmetry , since then @xmath40 .",
    "when we substitute eq.([detexpand ] ) back into eq .",
    "( [ znf ] ) , we see that @xmath41 , where the average @xmath42 is over the ising field configurations @xmath34 generated from the probability distribution @xmath43 . in the case of negative weight we replace @xmath44 by its absolute value @xmath45 and include a sign @xmath46 in the average : @xmath47 .",
    "the average @xmath42 now refers to the probability distribution @xmath45 .",
    "as we are interested in regions near half - filling , the sign problem does not limit the applicability of our method .    at low temperatures",
    "the canonical partition function ratio will be dominated by @xmath48 , the energy difference between the ground states for the two fillings , and will take the form @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the degeneracy of the ground state at filling @xmath7 .",
    "when there is an energy level close to the ground state ( produced by the elementary excitations such as spin waves ) , we include it explicitly in the fitting expressions : @xmath52 here @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the degeneracy of the spin wave state at filling @xmath7 , and @xmath55 are the spin - wave gaps at filling @xmath7 with respect to the ground state at half - filling .",

    "the imaginary parts of the determinant ratios are positive for @xmath68 , which is different from the tetrahedron and truncated tetrahedron cases .",
    "the cause of this difference is the relative size of electron and hole gaps in the system .",
    "the larger the gaps , the smaller the corresponding canonical partition function ratios @xmath83 . for the tetrahedron and the truncated tetrahedron",
    "the electron gaps are larger than the hole gaps , so @xmath84 .",
    "in contrast , for the c@xmath0 molecule the electron gap is smaller than the hole gap , so @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the relative size of the canonical partition function ratios results in a positive imaginary part of the determinant ratios for @xmath68 in fig .  [ c60b5det ] due to eq.([detexpand ] ) .",
    "similar fits were done for other temperatures , and the resulting canonical partition function parameters @xmath62 were obtained to calculate the canonical partition function ratios .",
    "unfortunately , eq .  ( [ nlf ] ) contains too many fitting parameters to provide unique fits to the data .",
    "therefore , we had to rely on the pqmc results ( at @xmath86 ) for the gap values @xmath87 and on the analysis of the molecular orbital energy level diagram ( fig . 3 of ref . ) for the degeneracies and their ratios",
    "@xmath88 we were able to demonstrate the consistency of the results obtained by the two methods ( icpqmc and pqmc ) by employing a following procedure .",
    "we first let all three gap values be free fitting parameters .",
    "fitting results are then in agreement with the pqmc results , albeit with rather large uncertainties .",
