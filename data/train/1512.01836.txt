    "in recent works @xcite we have developed a theory of quantum phase which is based on some enlarging of the fock space to the hilbert space of the square integrable functions on the circle , @xmath3 .",
    "then the well known machinery of the naimark projection is employed to find the respective objects in the original fock space .",
    "such an approach to quantum phase have been considered by many authors ( for references see @xcite ) . in our case",
    "we were able to define also a number - phase quasiprobability distribution which we called the _ number - phase wigner function _ @xcite .",
    "in short our construction can be introduced as follows : firstly , define the self - adjoint operator @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a normalised eigenvector of the number operator @xmath7 i. e. @xmath8 and @xmath9 stands for the phase state vector @xmath10 then the _ number - phase wigner function _ is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density operator of a given quantum system .",
    "the operator @xmath4 given by ( @xmath13 ) can serve as a _ number - phase stratonovich - weyl quantizer_. namely , for any classical number - phase function @xmath14 one can assign the respective operator @xmath15 according to the rule ( the _ generalized weyl quantization _ ) @xmath16 employing the well known formulae @xmath17 we quickly find that if @xmath18 @xmath19 and if @xmath20 then @xmath21 for any @xmath14 with the corresponding operator @xmath15 defined by ( [ eq1.5 ] ) the expectation value @xmath22 in a state @xmath12 is @xmath23 finally , the marginal distributions read    @xmath24    in particular for any function @xmath20 eqs ( [ eq1.9 ] ) and ( [ eq1.10b ] ) give @xmath25 with @xmath15 given by ( [ eq1.8 ] ) . as it has been pointed out by many authors @xcite the formula ( [ eq1.11 ] )",
    "gives the expectation value for the quantum phase - function @xmath26 equal to the one calculated within the pegg - barnett approach to quantum phase @xcite .",
    "consequently , our choice for a number - phase wigner function ( [ eq1.4 ] ) seems to be appropriate when the pegg - barnett formulation is considered . a crucial question one should answer is whether the given number - phase wigner function @xmath27 defines uniquely the respective density operator @xmath12 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have suggested that this is indeed the case ( see corrigendum in @xcite ) but we were not able to give any explicit formula therein .",
    "we fill this gap in section [ sec2 ] of the present paper .",
    "another important issue which is explored in section [ sec3 ] is the relation between @xmath28 and other well known in quantum optics quasiprobability distributions such as the _ glauber - sudarshan distribution @xmath0 _ , the _ husimi function @xmath29 _ or the _ wigner function @xmath30_. we find the formula which enables one to obtain the number - phase wigner function @xmath31 from those distributions and , in general from the _ cahill - glauber function @xmath32_. we hope that the results of the present work show that the function @xmath31 can be considered as some useful quasiprobability distribution depending on the photon number @xmath33 and on the phase @xmath34 ( see section [ sec4 ] where some conclusions are given ) .",
    "first , we recall some properties of the celebrated susskind - glogower ( sg ) phase operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite . they can be defined as @xmath37 and @xmath38 one can easily show that the annihilation @xmath39 and creation @xmath40 operators can be expressed in terms of the sg operators as follows @xmath41 and @xmath42 for any operator depending on @xmath7 @xmath43 one gets @xmath44 ( compare with ( [ eq2.3 ] ) ad ( [ eq2.4 ] ) ) . from ( [ eq2.1 ] ) and ( [ eq2.2 ] ) we quickly have @xmath45",
    "so @xmath46 and @xmath47 are certain lowering and raising operators , respectively . finally , employing ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , ( [ eq2.2 ] ) and the general definition ( [ eq1.8 ] ) one finds the relation @xmath48 using ( [ eq2.3 ] ) , ( [ eq2.4 ] ) , ( [ eq2.5 ] ) and ( [ eq2.7 ] ) , after performing straightforward calculations we get @xmath49 we express the density operator @xmath12 in the form @xmath50 i.e. as a series of operators constructed from @xmath39 and @xmath40 in anti - normal ordering . inserting ( [ eq2.8 ] ) into ( [ eq2.9 ] ) and using the last equality of ( [ eq2.7 ] ) one obtains @xmath51 where @xmath52 , are some operators , depending on @xmath7 . substituting ( [ eq2.10 ] ) into ( [ eq1.4 ] ) we get the number - phase wigner function @xmath27 in the form @xmath53\\\\       & +       \\sum_{m = n+1}^{\\infty }    \\left (   \\varrho_m(n ) e^{im\\phi}+\\varrho_m^*(n ) e^{-im\\phi }   \\right )      \\bigg\\}.   \\end{split}\\ ] ] from ( [ eq2.11 ] ) one immediately has    @xmath54    and we quickly conclude that to have all ingredients determining @xmath12 from a given @xmath31 we need @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( see ( [ eq2.12b ] ) ) .",

    "we begin our considerations with searching for a relation between @xmath84 and the celebrated glauber - sudarshan function @xmath0 defined by @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath67 stands for the normalised ket vector of the coherent state @xmath86 from the last equation of ( [ eq3.2 ] ) one quickly concludes that two different coherent states are non orthogonal .",
    "however , as is well known the set @xmath87 gives a resolution of the identity operator @xmath88 assuming @xmath12 in the form of ( [ eq2.9 ] ) and using ( [ eq3.3 ] ) and then the first formula of ( [ eq3.2 ] ) one gets @xmath89 comparing ( [ eq3.1 ] ) and ( [ eq3.4 ] ) we immediately have @xmath90 to express @xmath91 by @xmath0 we insert ( [ eq3.1 ] ) into ( [ eq1.4 ] ) and we obtain @xmath92 employing ( [ eq1.3 ] ) and ( [ eq3.2 ] ) , and performing simple calculations one gets @xmath93        \\mathrm{d}^2 \\alpha\\ ] ] where @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "now we are going to study the relation between @xmath31 and the _ cahill - glauber function @xmath1 _ defined as @xcite @xmath96,\\quad \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{c}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 with @xmath99 standing for the _ displacement operator _ @xmath100 note that for @xmath101 , the cahill - glauber function @xmath102 is usually denoted by @xmath103 and it is well known in quantum optics as the _ husimi function _ ; for @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the famous _ wigner function _ and for @xmath106 we get @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "given @xmath1 , @xmath108 , one can find the respective density operator @xmath12 from the following formula ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath109 substituting ( [ eq3.11 ] ) into ( [ eq1.4 ] ) we get @xmath110 the matrix elements of @xmath111 are given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 stands for the associated laguerre polynomial . inserting ( [ eq3.13 ] ) into ( [ eq3.12 ] ) , after some simple manipulations one arrives at the formula @xmath114 }   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we put @xmath115 .",
    "although the relation ( [ eq3.14 ] ) is rather involved it shows that , in principle , given the cahill - glauber function @xmath1 , @xmath116 , we can find the respective number - phase wigner function @xmath31 .",
    "of course , since @xmath31 defines uniquely the density operator @xmath12 ( see section [ sec2 ] ) and @xmath12 defines @xmath1 by ( [ eq3.8 ] ) one concludes that given @xmath31 we can find the respective @xmath1 .",
    "however the relevant formula seems to be extremely involved .",
    "we conclude that the proposed number - phase wigner function @xmath31 can be used as a quasiprobability distribution in quantum optics .",
    "the natural question is what are the relations between @xmath31 and other number - phase wigner functions introduced previously by several authors @xcite .",
    "another interesting question is if our consideration of the number - phase wigner function can be carried over to the case of a quantum system with finite dimensional space of states .",
    "if it can be done then the respective procedure would provide us with an approach to the weyl - wigner - moyal formalism in quantum mechanics of discrete systems alternative to the one given by s.  chaturvedi et al @xcite .",
