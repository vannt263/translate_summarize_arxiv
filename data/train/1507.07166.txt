    "the ground state ( gs ) of strongly interacting spin systems immersed in a magnetic field @xmath3 can exhibit , under certain conditions , the remarkable phenomenon of factorization @xcite , i.e. , of becoming a product of single spin states .",
    "such exact factorization can occur at finite fields despite the strong couplings existing between the spins , albeit at very specific values ( and orientation ) of the field . in the seminal work of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that antiferromagnetic ( afm ) chains with first neighbor @xmath0 couplings possess a separable nel - type gs ( ngs ) if the field vector lies on the surface of an ellipsoid determined by the couplings .",
    "factorization was then investigated in other models with transverse fields @xcite , with a general formalism for describing factorization introduced and discussed in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that in _ finite _ @xmath0 chains , the transverse factorizing field ( tff ) @xmath4 pointing along a principal axis ( @xmath5 ) corresponds actually to the last gs @xmath6 parity transition ( level crossing ) .",
    "the ensuing separable gs is two - fold degenerate , breaking a basic symmetry of the hamiltonian ( @xmath6 parity ) .",
    "the non - transverse factorizing fields ( ntff ) @xmath2 of @xcite will be shown to also belong to this class in finite cyclic chains , i.e. , they arise at the last gs level crossing and determine a degenerate separable gs breaking translational invariance ( ti ) . in finite systems the underlying mechanism of factorization in these cases is the existence of separable linear combinations of the symmetry preserving entangled crossing states .    in this work",
    "we first determine the general conditions for exact factorization under non - transverse fields .",
    "it is then shown that a _ uniform _",
    "non - degenerate separable gs ( ugs ) does exist at a field @xmath1 which does not belong in general to the ellipsoid of ref .",
    "@xcite , and does not correspond to a level crossing .",
    "this gs actually arises in both afm and fm - type systems , even for couplings of arbitrary range provided there is a fixed anisotropy ratio , but only for fields parallel to a principal plane , with the set of fields @xmath1 forming four straight lines .",
    "factorization emerges here from the splitting of the degenerate separable eigenstates existing at the tff @xmath4 . unlike @xmath2",
    ", @xmath1 can be arbitrarily strong , allowing the separation of the ugs from the remaining spectrum .",
    "this enables an easy preparation of an exactly separable state , which can be useful for quantum information applications ( a product initial state is assumed in the standard model of quantum computation @xcite ) .",
    "a second but not less important aspect of factorization is that it corresponds to an _ entanglement transition _ : in the transverse case , the factorizing field is , remarkably , the point where pairwise entanglement reaches _ full range _ in its immediate vicinity , and changes its type @xcite .",
    "we had previously shown that the entanglement between any two spins reaches in a finite chain weak yet finite _ common side - limits _ at the transverse field @xmath4 , irrespective of separation or coupling range @xcite , arising from the entangled crossing states .",
    "this type of limit also occurs at the ntff @xmath2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , as will be shown .",
    "but in addition , we will prove that pairwise entanglement also reaches full range at the vicinity of the ntff @xmath1 leading to a non - degenerate ugs . here",
    "the entanglement between any two spins , though 0 at @xmath1 , is turned on as @xmath1 is approached from either side , with the concurrence vanishing then linearly with @xmath7 .",
    "the underlying reason is essentially the monogamy of entanglement @xcite , which prevents distant pairs from becoming entangled if first or close neighbors are strongly entangled . in the vicinity of @xmath8",
    ", close neighbor entanglement decreases strongly , allowing the emergence of weak yet non - zero entanglement between distant pairs .",
    "the behavior of the block entanglement entropy in the vicinity of the ntff will be also analyzed .",
    "it will be shown to vanish essentially quadratically at @xmath1 , while at @xmath2 it will approach finite side - limits in a finite chain , which will be analytically determined .",
    "the entanglement spectrum will indicate , as expected , just one nonzero eigenvalue at @xmath1 , although at the side - limits of @xmath2 two nonzero eigenvalues will remain .",
    "the general equations for non - transverse factorizing fields and its uniform and nel - type solutions are derived and discussed in section [ ii ] , whereas entanglement together with illustrative results for the pairwise concurrence , block entropy , entanglement spectrum and magnetization in fm and afm chains with @xmath9 and @xmath0 couplings under non - transverse fields are discussed in section iii .",
    "conclusions are derived in iv .",

    "this fact explains the pronounced increase of the block entropies of the fm case as the field vanish , since they approach in this limit the higher afm values .",
    "this symmetry no longer holds for finite fields not pointing along the @xmath5 axis .    in spin @xmath284 systems ,",
    "the magnetization can be used as a _",
    "separability witness _ : the quantity @xmath321 satisfies @xmath322 in any pure entangled state of such system , with @xmath323 if and only if the pure state is completely separable . for a state with ti , @xmath324 , with @xmath325 the total magnetization .",

    "[ f5 ] , entailing a non - monotonous behavior of @xmath234 for increasing fields , as seen in the insets .",
    "we have numerically checked that such non - monotonous behavior persists for larger sizes , indicating that it is not a finite size effect .",
    "therefore , through a careful measurement of @xmath327 or the associated susceptibility as a function of the applied field , one could be able to identify the ntff @xmath1 .    in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] it is seen that the ugs at @xmath1 is non - degenerate and well separated from the first excited state , whereas the ngs at @xmath2 is two - fold degenerate . actually , as seen from the energy gap and also from the magnetization and previous entanglement measures , while no transitions are observed in the fm case , in the afm case the exact gs exhibits @xmath302 transitions as @xmath328 increases at fixed @xmath125 , the last one taking place at @xmath2 .",
    "they correspond to `` translational parity '' transitions @xmath329 , with @xmath330 the exact ti ground states , which satisfy @xmath331 ( @xmath253 is the one - site translation operator ) .",
    "these transitions are similar to those observed for transverse fields in both afm or fm systems @xcite , where they are related with spin parity transitions and also end at the corresponding transverse factorizing field @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath2 still represents , in the non - transverse case , a critical field for the finite system , indicating the passage to a different regime .",
    "finally , we depict in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] results for the pairwise concurrence in a chain with full @xmath0 couplings , a system which can not be mapped to independent fermions even in the transverse case ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have set @xmath332 , in both the fm ( @xmath333 ) and afm ( @xmath334 ) cases , using the same previous field orientations .",
    "the behavior is quite similar to that of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , with the gs translational parity transitions also present in the afm case .",
    "one just notes the higher values of @xmath292 above the factorizing fields in both cases , and the closer side - limits at @xmath2 in the afm case ( now @xmath335 , @xmath336 ) , due to the different value of the anisotropy ratio @xmath75 .",
    "the values at zero field are again still strictly coincident due to the same sign of @xmath175 .",
    "results for the block entropy and entanglement spectrum for the finite case considered are also qualitatively similar to the previous results .",
    "we have first determined the general conditions for the existence of separable eigenstates with maximum spin at each site in general arrays with anisotropic @xmath0 couplings immersed in a non - transverse field .",
    "the set of factorizing fields can be characterized by the local fields orthogonal to the local alignment direction , plus arbitrary fields parallel to the latter .",
    "we have next identified the possibility of a uniform non - degenerate separable gs in quite general systems of arbitrary spin , including fm and afm - type chains and arrays , for fields parallel to a principal plane ( fig .",
    "the coupling range can be arbitrary , provided the anisotropy ratio @xmath75 is constant . in afm @xmath0 chains with first neighbor couplings ,",
    "this separable solution coexists in field space with the nel - type separable solution .",
    "we have also demonstrated , for arbitrary spin , that pairwise entanglement reaches full range in a finite array in the vicinity of the factorizing field determining the uniform solution , with the concurrence vanishing linearly at this field .",
    "full range is also reached at the nel ntff , although here it was shown that in finite cyclic even chains , the pairwise concurrence reaches finite side - limits in its vicinity , which were analytically evaluated .",
    "this ntff was shown to correspond to the last parity transition of the gs in the finite cyclic chain .",
    "block entropies were also analyzed and shown to vanish quadratically at the uniform ntff , while reaching again finite ( and analytically determined ) side - limits at the nel ntff in these finite chains .",
    "present results and limits are also applicable to more complex systems , like dimerized chains and arrays @xcite .",
    "the recent possibility of performing quantum simulations of spin chains and lattices with tunable couplings through cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite or trapped ions @xcite augments the potential of the present results .",
    "such experiments could then provide valuable insights into the remarkable phenomenon of factorization and its relation with entanglement and criticality in finite many body systems .",
