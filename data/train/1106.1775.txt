    "thermodynamics successfully describes equilibrium properties of macroscopic objects coupled to a heat bath . in the standard theory ,",
    "the system - bath interaction is assumed to be small and is therefore neglected .",
    "this is a well - justified assumption when the coupling energy is small compared to the thermal energy of the system @xcite .",
    "however , at low temperatures , quantum effects come into play and the interaction energy can not be discarded anymore @xcite .",
    "this is particularly relevant for solid - state nanodevices , such as nanomechanical oscillators , which may be strongly coupled to their environment @xcite . in the limit of vanishingly small coupling ,",
    "the damped quantum system asymptotically relaxes to the correct thermal gibbs state @xcite .",
    "however , for any finite interaction strength , the stationary state of the quantum system deviates from a gibbs state , in contrast to the prediction of thermodynamics .",
    "it has , for example , been shown that , at zero temperature , the coupled oscillator is in an excited , mixed state and not in its pure ground state @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is worth noticing that the deviation from a gibbs state leads to the interesting possibility of entangling two noninteracting coherent states via the indirect coupling to a common reservoir @xcite .",
    "a useful quantity to describe classical systems that are strongly coupled to their environment is the so - called potential of mean force @xcite .",
    "it was first introduced by kirkwood in his study of the average structure of liquids @xcite .",
    "it has since proved to be an invaluable tool in chemistry @xcite , where it is commonly employed in the investigation of implicit solvent models @xcite and of protein - ligand binding @xcite , to name a few examples .",
    "a quantum extension in the form of the hamiltonian of mean force ( hmf ) , see eq .",
    "below , has recently been proposed in ref .",
    "potential and hamiltonian of mean force are instrumental in characterizing the deviations from standard thermodynamics that occur in the strong coupling regime .",
    "however , they are difficult to evaluate explicitly in the general case . here",
    ", we use the quantum hmf to quantify the deviation from the thermal gibbs state for a damped quantum harmonic oscillator , for which we obtain exact analytical results .",
    "we further derive approximate expressions for arbitrary systems in the strong damping regime .",
    "we additionally relate the hmf to the thermodynamic change of energy and entropy associated with the initial coupling between system and bath .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we introduce the concept of the quantum hmf and show how it can be used to characterize the deviation from a thermal gibbs state . in section [ sec:3 ] , we determine the exact expression for this deviation for the case of the analytically solvable damped quantum harmonic oscillator . in section [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we provide useful approximations in the limit of high and low temperatures , weak and strong coupling . furthermore in the semiclassical limit",
    ", we employ the quantum smoluchowski equation to evaluate the deviation from the gibbs state for any damped quantum system . in section [ sec:5 ] ,",
    "we finally give a physical interpretation of the hmf by establishing a relationship with the initial system - bath coupling .",
    "we consider the total hamiltonian , @xmath0 which describes a quantum system @xmath1 coupled to a heat bath @xmath2 via the interaction @xmath3 .",
    "the equilibrium state of the total system is given by the gibbs state , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total partition function and @xmath6 the inverse temperature of the bath .",
    "when the interaction energy is negligible , @xmath7 , the reduced density operator of the system , @xmath8 , is also of the gibbs form , @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "however , for finite coupling , the interaction term can not be neglected , and the reduced density operator is no longer of the gibbs form . it can generically be written as , @xmath11 where the quantum hmf is defined as the effective hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath12 the corresponding partition function is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the hmf reduces to the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath14 , in the limit of vanishing coupling .",

    "we evaluate the deviation @xmath16 explicitly for the damped quantum harmonic oscillator .",
