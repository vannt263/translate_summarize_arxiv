    "a _ loop _ is an algebraic system @xmath0 satisfying the equations @xmath1 see the books @xcite for further information . since loops in general form too broad a class for detailed study , the literature has focused on various sub - varieties of loops .",
    "many of these varieties are defined by some weakening of the _ associative _ law , @xmath2 .",
    "some obvious weakenings are the _ flexible _ laws and the _ left _ and _ right _ _ alternative _ laws : @xmath3 there is also the _ inverse property , ip_. this asserts that there is a permutation @xmath4 of order two such that ( writing @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) left and right division are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "to see that the ip defines a variety of loops , note that it can be expressed by the equations @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "most of the loops considered in this paper have the ip .",
    "the ip implies the antiautomorphic inverse property ( aaip ) , @xmath11 , so that @xmath4 provides an isomorphism from the loop @xmath12 onto its opposite loop @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 ) .",
    "thus , in ip loops , the right and left versions of properties ( e.g. , ralt and lalt ) are equivalent .    in a loop @xmath15 , the left and right translations by @xmath16 are defined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the _ multiplication group _ of @xmath15 is the permutation group on @xmath15 , @xmath19 , generated by all left and right translations .",
    "the _ inner mapping group _ is the subgroup @xmath20 fixing @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath15 is a group , then @xmath20 is the group of inner automorphisms of @xmath15 . in an ip loop",
    ", the aaip implies that we can conjugate by @xmath4 to get : @xmath22 where @xmath23 for a permutation @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath24 is an inner mapping , then so is @xmath25 .",
    "this leads us to one of the classes of ip loops we study in this paper :    a _ rif loop _ is an ip loop @xmath15 with the property that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "equivalently , inner mappings preserve inverses , i.e. , @xmath28 for all @xmath27 and all @xmath16 .",
    "rif loops include the _ steiner loops _ , which may be defined to be ip loops of exponent two ( that is , @xmath29 , so @xmath4 is the identity permutation ) .",
    "steiner loops arise naturally in combinatorics , since they correspond uniquely to steiner triple systems ; specifically , the steiner loop @xmath15 corresponds to the triple system @xmath30 on @xmath31 .",
    "rif loops also include what is probably the most well - studied class of nonassociative loops , namely those satisfying the _ moufang laws _",
    "@xcite :    [ def : moufang ] a _ moufang loop _ is a loop satisfying the following equations : @xmath32    in fact , by work of bol and bruck , each of these equations implies the other three ( see bruck @xcite , lemma 3.1 , p.  115 ) . that every moufang loop is rif follows from lemma 3.2 , p.  117",
    ", of @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen that the only loops which are both steiner and moufang are the boolean groups .",
    "thus a direct product of a nonassociative steiner loop with a nonassociative moufang loop is a rif loop which is neither steiner nor moufang .",
    "a loop is said to be _ diassociative _ if the subloop @xmath33 generated by any two elements is a group .",
    "diassociative loops are always ip loops , and are flexible and alternative .",
    "steiner loops are obviously diassociative ; in fact each @xmath33 is a boolean group ( of order @xmath21 , @xmath34 , or @xmath35 ) .",
    "less obviously , by moufang s theorem , every moufang loop is diassociative .",
    "bruck and paige @xcite defined an _ a - loop _ to be a loop in which every inner mapping is an automorphism .",
    "an a - loop need not be an ip - loop , but they show , by modifying the proof of moufang s theorem , that every ip a - loop is diassociative .",
    "in fact , it turned out later @xcite that the ip a - loops form a proper sub - variety of the moufang loops .",
    "weakening of the notion of ip a - loop so that inner mappings preserve inverses , but not necessarily products , we obtain rif loops .",
    "the notion `` rif '' can be expressed by a finite set of equations ( lemma [ lem : rif - equiv ] ) . these lead naturally ( lemma [ lem : rif - implies - arif ] ) to a slightly weaker notion , arif .",
    "[ def : arif ] an arif loop is a flexible loop satisfying the following equations : @xmath36    in fact , a flexible loop satisfying either w1 or w2 has the ip and hence satisfies both equations ( lemma [ lem : arif - ip ] ) .",
    "every arif loop of odd order is moufang ( corollary [ cor - odd ] ) ( whereas non - group steiner loops are rif and not moufang ) . besides rif loops",
    ", arif includes another variety of ip loops , namely the flexible c - loops ( corollary [ coro : flex - c - arif ] ) .",
    "c - loops were introduced by fenyves @xcite ; see section [ sec - basics ] .",
    "there exist flexible c - loops which are not rif loops ( example [ ex - flex - c - non - rif ] ) , and there exist arif loops which are neither rif loops nor c - loops ( see section [ sec - ex ] ) .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "section [ sec - dias ] is devoted to the proof of our main result , a generalization of moufang s theorem to arif loops :    [ thm - dias ] every arif loop is diassociative .",
    "our inductive proof of this theorem is patterned on moufang s proof , but is quite a bit more complicated than hers , or than the corresponding proof in bruck and paige @xcite for ip a - loops .",
    "we do not know a simpler proof , but example [ ex - steiner ] shows that the basic lemma on associators developed by moufang can fail in a arif loop ( in fact , in a steiner loop ) .",
    "note that if we write out the definition of diassociativity in the obvious way , we get an infinite list of equations .",
    "the following problem , asked first by evans and neumann @xcite , is still open :    [ question - dias ] does the variety of diassociative loops have a finite basis ?",
    "if the answer is `` yes '' , which seems unlikely , then inductive proofs of diassociativity could always be replaced by the verification of a finite number of instances of diassociativity , which could result in a simplification .",
    "our investigations were aided by the automated reasoning tools otter , developed by mccune @xcite , and sem developed by j. zhang and h. zhang @xcite .",
    "sem finds finite models of systems of axioms , and was used to produce the three examples in section [ sec - ex ] .",
    "otter derives statements from axioms , and was used to derive enough instances of diassociativity from arif for the pattern to become clear .",
    "following bruck @xcite ( see iv.1 ) , the inner mapping group of any loop is generated by the inner mappings of the form @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 :    [ def : inner ] @xmath44 + @xmath45 @xmath46    using this , we can express the notion of rif by equations .",
    "[ lem : rif - equiv ] the following are equivalent for an ip loop @xmath15 :    * @xmath15 is a rif loop .",

    "conversely , if ( 3 ) holds , then taking @xmath58 gives the flexible law , so that ( 3 ) implies ( 2 ) .",
    "finally , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are equivalent by the ip .    combining 3 and 4 from lemma [ lem : rif - equiv ] we obtain the very useful identity @xmath59 , which we will frequently appeal to in our arguments .",
    "for the next result , we introduce the notation @xmath60 .    in a rif loop , @xmath61 .    applying lemma [ lem : rif - equiv ] twice , @xmath62 .    the fact that moufang loops satisfy @xmath61 is theorem 5.1 , p.  120",

    "but in flexible loops , these are simply restatements of the moufang equations @xmath65 in definition [ def : moufang ] , so they do not hold in all rif loops , since they fail in any non - group steiner loop .",
