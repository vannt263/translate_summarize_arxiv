    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are powered by accretion of matter onto a super massive ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) black hole ( smbh ) , and produce a large amount of energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) as electromagnetic radiation ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) , over a wide range of wavelengths ( from radio to hard x - rays , and even to tev photons ) . the strong radiation from agns influences the physical properties ( e.g. , the ionization structure , gas dynamics and density distribution ) of their vicinity , their host galaxies , and even of the inter - galactic material of galaxy clusters to which they belong ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of the radiation - driven outflows from agns as a feedback process is recognized in many of the galaxy formation / evolutionary models ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; ciotti et al .  2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "the formation of agn outflows , of course , can be caused by some mechanisms other than radiation pressure , e.g. , magnetocentrifugal force ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thermal pressure ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the highly blueshifted line absorption features often seen in the observed uv and optical spectra of agns can be best described by the radiation - driven wind models ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , provided that the ionization state of the gas is appropriate . in reality , these forces may interplay and contribute to the dynamics of the outflows in agns in somewhat different degrees ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the agn environment on relatively large scales ( @xmath6  pc ) is a mixture of gas and dust ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation pressure on dust can drive the dust outflows , and their dynamics is likely to be coupled with the gas dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on much smaller scales ( @xmath7  pc ) , the dust is less likely to survive because the temperature of the environment is too high ( @xmath8 ) ; hence , the studies of the radiation - driven outflow dynamics using only gas component ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) would be justified in those cases .    in the first paper of this series ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) , the initial phase of our gas dynamics studies of agns on sub - parsec and parsec scales was set . since the problem is complex , as it involves many aspects of physics such as multi - dimensional fluid dynamics , radiative processes , and magnetic processes , our approach was to set up simulations as simple as possible .",
    "the study focused on exploring the effects of x - ray heating ( which is important in the so - called preheated accretion ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and radiation pressure on gas that is gravitationally captured by a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "we adopted the numerical methods developed by @xcite for studying radiation - driven disk winds in agns .",
    "our simulations covered a relatively unexplored range of the distance from the central bh , i.e. , the outer boundary of our simulations coincides with the inner boundary of many galaxy models ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and our inner boundary starts just outside of the outer boundary of many bh accretion models ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of gas rotation was not included in paper  i.    in the second paper in this series ( @xcite , hereafter paper  ii ) , the effect of gas rotation , position - dependent radiation temperature , density at large radii , and uniform x - ray background radiation were explored . as in the non - rotating case considered in paper  i",
    ", the rotating flow settles into a configuration with two components : ( 1 )  an equatorial inflow and ( 2 )  a bipolar inflow / outflow with the outflow leaving the system along the polar axis .",
    "however , with rotation the flow does not always reach a steady state .",
    "in addition , rotation reduces the outflow collimation and the outward fluxes of mass and kinetic energy .",
    "moreover rotation increases the outward flux of the thermal energy , and it can lead to fragmentation and time - variability of the outflow .",
    "it is also shown that the position - dependent radiation temperature can significantly change the flow solution , i.e. , the inflow in the equatorial region can be replaced by a thermally driven outflow . as it been discussed and shown in the past ( e.g. , @xcite ; ciotti et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) , the self - consistently determined preheating / cooling from the quasar radiation can significantly reduce the mass accretion rate of the central bh .",
    "our results clearly demonstrated that quasar radiation can drive non - spherical , multi - temperature and very dynamic flows .",
    "this effect becomes dominant for the systems with luminosity in excess of 0.01 times the eddington luminosity .",
    "the work presented here is a direct extension of the previous axi - symmetric models of paper  i and paper  ii to a full 3-d model , and is an extended version of the 3-d models presented in @xcite to which we have added the radiation force due to spectral lines and the radiative cooling and heating effect .",
    "here , we consider two cases from paper  i and paper  ii : ( 1 )  the formation of outflows from the accretion of the ambient gas with no rotation and ( 2 )  that with rotation , in 3-d .",
    "we note that our work is complimentary to the work by @xcite who studied the hydrodynamics of axisymmetric torus winds in agns",
    ".    the main goals of this study are ( 1 )  to examine if there is a significant difference between two models with physically identical conditions but in different dimensionality ( 2-d and 3-d ) , ( 2 )  to study if the radiation driven outflows that were found to be stable in the previous studies in 2-d ( paper  i ; paper  ii ) remain stable in 3-d simulations , and ( 3 )  to understand gas dynamics in agns , in particular the dynamics of the narrow line regions ( nlr ) by comparing our simulation results with observations .    in the following section ,",
