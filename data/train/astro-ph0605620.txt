    "russell diagram ( hrd ) of pre - main sequence ( pms ) evolutionary tracks is very sensitive to modeling details such as opacity , atmospheric boundary conditions , rotation and convection treatment . @xcite and @xcite pointed out that , at least for  down to 4000  k , the treatment of convection transport plays a role on the pms evolutionary tracks that is much more important than the effects from recent improvements of low temperature opacities .",
    "they showed that it is the  average efficiency \" of convection in the envelope which determines both , the  of pms tracks and the lithium depletion during this phase of stellar evolution .",
    "unfortunately , the approaches traditionally used in stellar evolution to describe the heat transport by convection are quite rough . the mixing length theory ( mlt , bhm - vitense 1958 ) as well as the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) model @xcite are local theories , which ignore physical processes such as convective overshoot and radiative transfer effects .    the efficiency of convection in the superadiabatic region at the top of convective stellar envelopes determines the asymptotic value of the entropy in the deep and adiabatically stratified layers and , therefore , the star radius and .",
    "any treatment of convection , adjusted to obtain the correct adiabat , will provide similar global structures .",
    "this is the base of the mlt solar calibration .",
    "given the relationship between convective flux and over  adiabaticity in the mlt ( @xmath2 ) , increasing the value of the @xmath3 parameter we decrease the value of the over - adiabaticity , and the radius decreases .",
    "the only parameter in the mlt , @xmath3 , is tuned to reproduce the solar radius at the solar age .",
    "this method has provided very good results , in spite of its simplicity .",
    "nevertheless , the sun yields only one calibration value , and no physical principle guarantees this value to be appropriate for the whole hr diagram , or the whole stellar structure .    the mass of the stellar convective envelope increases with decreasing , and its top gradually shifts towards larger depths , so that the structure of the surface layers is less and less affected by convection as  decreases . for temperatures lower than 4700  k",
    ", however , the convection zone rises again due to h@xmath4 dissociation .",
    "furthermore , as gravity decreases , the convective flux decreases because of the lower density , and therefore , the over - adiabatic region is more and more extended in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "specific atmosphere models with an adequate treatment of radiation and convection transports are hence mandatory .    the available grids of model atmospheres for general use of stellar structure ( atlas9 by kurucz 1993 and nextgen by hauschildt et al .",
    "1999 ) were generally computed just for one specific convection model , e.g. a given @xmath5 value in the mlt .",
    "hence , in the solar calibration , only the mlt parameter used in the interior can be changed .",
    "@xcite showed that this kind of procedure can lead to an uncertainty of the order of 200  k in the 1  pms track ( without changing the effective temperature of ms ) , since its  depends on the optical depth chosen to match the interior and the atmosphere models .",
    "on the other hand , heiter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) computed fst atlas9 models with a value of the @xmath6 parameter fixed by a grey fst solar calibration .",
    "a non  grey fst solar calibration requires a larger value of @xmath6 ( 0.18 in the atmosphere and in the interior ventura , private communication ) . nevertheless , given the different properties of @xmath6 and @xmath3 parameters , a discrepancy between @xmath7 and @xmath8 have no very serious consequences on the stellar structure or on the evolutionary tracks ( as shown in @xcite , this discrepancy can lead to an uncertainty in at given mass and luminosity of the order of 2% , and @xmath91% for 1  ) . in any case ,",
    "non  grey fst stellar models ( either with @xmath8=@xmath7 , or with @xmath8=2@xmath10 ) predict a too large pre - ms lithium depletion compared to observational data in open clusters .",
    "a more realistic approach consists in solving the hydrodynamic equations coupled to the equation of radiative transfer .",
    "recently much progress has been made in performing 2 - 3d radiative ",
    "hydrodynamical ( rhd ) simulations of stellar surface convection ( e.g. freytag et al .",
    "1996 ; stein & nordlund 1998 ; asplund et al .",
    "2000 ; ludwig et al .",
    "these results , however , can not be directly used in stellar evolution computations .",
    "a way of overcoming the problem of computing convection would be to have grids of 3d non local models , and , at each ( t@xmath11-gravity ) , calibrate the @xmath12  value which provides the same specific entropy jump between the atmosphere and the adiabatic region .",
    "this procedure does not give information on the structure of the overadiabatic layers , but allows a proper computation of the interior .",
    "extensive 3d rhd simulations for general applications to the computation of stellar evolution are not yet available , but 2d rhd simulations have been performed by @xcite for a large grid of  and gravity values , and the structural information from these models has been translated into an effective mixing - length parameter @xmath13 , suitable to construct standard stellar structure models .    as the results from rhd models are in principle more reliable than the local models , we computed pre ",
    "ms and ms evolution , based on @xcite , for masses from 0.8 to 1.5  .",
    "we compare the resulting evolutionary tracks and li abundance with those from recent local models @xcite , which assume fst convection both in the non  grey atmosphere and in the envelope structure .",
    "the application of 3d rhd atmosphere computation to studies of spectral line formation , have also shown that in many cases standard 1d analyses are very misleading in terms of derived element abundances ( asplund 2005 ) .",
    "in particular , 3d computations together with a much more accurate analysis of solar spectrum and a non - lte treatment , led to a drastic revision of the photospheric solar composition .",
    "asplund et al .  ( 2004 and 2005 ) analysis results in a significant reduction of solar metallicity down to @xmath14 .",
    "we expect that a smaller lithium depletion could be obtained if we revise downward the solar metallicity .",
    "unfortunately , the 2d rhd models by ludwig et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the corresponding @xmath13 calibration , are only available for the higher  old \" solar metallicity and helium mass fraction y=0.28 .",
    "as we show in section  3 that fst and mlt@xmath1 results are very similar for the standard  old \" solar metallicity , we compute fst pre  ms tracks with the scaled down metal abundances , to test if the new abundances could solve the problem of pms - lithium depletion in young open clusters .",
    "@xcite , by using their 2d rhd atmosphere models , provided a calibration of the @xmath3 parameter as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the domain @xmath17  k , @xmath18 .",
    "we would like to stress two interesting aspects of this calibration in the pms evolution context : first , the 2d models indicate that convection is on average ` efficient ' in the atmosphere and the envelope , corresponding to a large @xmath3 value ; and , second , @xmath3 increases as @xmath15 decreases .",
    "the @xmath13 behavior has been confirmed by 3d atmosphere models .",
    "ludwig , allard and hauschildt ( 2002 ) find , for an m dwarf at @xmath19  k and @xmath20 , @xmath212.1 , a value noticeably larger than that required for the sun ( @xmath211.6 ) .",
    "@xcite made a similar @xmath22 calibration by using 3d model atmospheres computed by means of a different code ( the time ",
    "dependent , compressible , explicit , radiative - hydrodynamics code by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the range of main sequence gravities and @xmath23=3.683.83",
    ", this @xmath22 calibration shows the same behavior than the @xmath13 one and a systematic offset , in the sense @xmath24 . for the sun ,",
    "@xcite found than their 2d - based calibration underestimates the value of @xmath3 by a factor @xmath25 , and they explained that as due to a combined effect of low - temperature opacities and the 2d approximation . on the other hand , @xcite have compared 2d and 3d atmosphere models for sun , and find that the 2d solar model has marginally larger gradients than the 3d one .",
    "@xcite propose the use of a constant scaling factor to compensate the systematic offset seen in the sun , as the relative variations of @xmath3 with  and  should be less affected by systematic shortcomings such as the 2d approximation .",
    "it has also been shown that there is no unique value of the @xmath3 parameter that can reproduce the temperature gradients in the over - adiabatic regions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the function ( , ) by @xcite , guarantees that the adiabat of a stellar model , computed with this @xmath13 and grey boundary conditions , provides the same adiabat ( and therefore the same radius and effective temperature ) as one from a complete 2d rhd computation .",
    "vs. log  g plane ( solid line ; non  grey models with @xmath26 by montalbn et al .",
    "( 2004a ) and 2d calibrated mlt ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "an additional advantage of the procedure of computing 2d models is that the entropy in the adiabatic convection region is independently determined and is not affected by the ambiguity and the uncertainties deriving from the use of several different physics in the over ",
    "adiabatic region of the star .",
    "so , standard non  grey mlt models are not necessarily equivalent to mlt-2d/3d ones even if the numerical value of @xmath3 parameter used in the stellar structure computations is in both cases the same or of the same order",
    ". we must indeed be careful when looking at the exact meaning of published results .",
    "for instance , the 2d models will _ not _ be similar to the popular set of non  grey models having  @xmath27 \" by @xcite .",
    "in fact , these models have indeed @xmath28 in the computation of the internal structure , but the atmosphere down to @xmath29 , i.e. to the match point with with the interior , is computed with @xmath30 . it has been often pointed out that the pms tracks by @xcite match better observations since they have lower t@xmath31  than other computations ( e.g. hillenbrand & white 2004 ) and , sometimes , that has been attributed to the improved opacity in the adopted nextgen atmospheres ( allard & hauschidt , 1997 , hereinafter ah97 ) . on the contrary , for mass values close to the solar mass , a large part of this result is simply due to the very low efficiency of convection in the most superadiabatic part of the star , namely the atmosphere down to @xmath29 ( montalbn et al .  2004a ; dantona & montalbn 2003 ) .",
    "the calibration of @xmath3 in @xcite , whose zero point must be obtained by reproducing the solar radius , is valid for grey models , so the same @xmath3 value is used in the whole structure , and the results are less ambiguous and easier to be interpreted .",
    "the mlt@xmath1 stellar models have been computed with the code aton2.0 ( ventura et al .",
    "1998a ) , with grey boundary conditions , and the mlt option for convection .",
    "@xcite suggest , in the context of stellar evolutionary models , to calibrate @xmath32 with the present sun , and to use its ratio to @xmath33 as scaling factor for the function @xmath13 ( , ) .",
    "so , we used the value @xmath34 ( obtained from the grey mlt sun calibration with aton2.0 ) to scale the analytical fits of @xmath3 ( , ) by @xcite .",
    "these  solar - calibrated \" analytical fits were introduced in aton2.0 to allow for a continuous variation of the @xmath3 parameter as the star evolves in the hr diagram .",
    "the adopted helium mass fraction is y=0.28 and the metal mass fraction is z=0.02 .",
    "the other physical inputs are the same as in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we superimpose the 2d  tracks ( dashed  lines ) and the non  grey fst models by @xcite in the plane log  g vs. .",
    "the latter tracks are computed by using the @xcite boundary conditions , and adopt fst convection , both in the atmosphere and in the interior .",
    "the two sets of results , in the range 0.8  1.5 are very similar .",
    "since stellar radii ( and therefore the s ) are determined by the efficiency of convection in the over - adiabatic region , we can conclude that the global efficiency of convection in 2d  and fst models is very similar .",
    "this allows the use of fst models as proxies of 2d rhd models , also for different chemistry .",
    "so , we have computed low metallicity fst models with chemical and convection parameters given by the new solar calibration , that is : y=0.2495 , z=0.01305 and the fst @xmath6 parameter equal to 0.117 .     calibrated mlt ( solid lines ) and complete ( non grey ) fst models ( dashed lines ) ]    and",

    "lithium is a light element that is burned by the nuclear reaction @xmath37 at a relatively low temperature ( t@xmath38  k ) .",
    "the pms lithium depletion rate strongly depends on temperature and density at the bottom of the convective region .",
    "lithium abundances detected in young open clusters , such as the pleiades and @xmath12per ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , indicate that solar mass stars do not deplete a significant fraction lithium during their pms .",
    "that implies structures of these stars with a temperature at the base of their convective envelope smaller than t@xmath39 .",
    "it is generally accepted ( gough & weiss 1976 ; christensen - darlsgaard 1997 ) that the overall late - type stars structure does not depend on the details of the treatment of over - adiabatic regions .",
    "hence , the radius is determined by the value of the entropy jump between the photosphere and the deep adiabatic regions .",
    "christensen - dalsgaard ( 1997 ) pointed out that , for the sun , the depth of the convective zone is almost insensitive to changes in the adiabat of the convective zone , and that the changes in the surface radius are due only to the changes of the radius of the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "he also pointed out that the same should probably occur for other stars , if the derivatives of opacity with respect to temperature and density are of the same order than in the sun .",
    "the similarity between fst and mlt@xmath1track locations suggests that the `` average efficiency '' of convection is quite close in both series of models , and hence we expect that also the lithium depletion in the mlt@xmath1 models should be similar to that of the fst ones . in fig .",
    "[ figlimasa ] we plot the lithium depletion as a function of time for masses between 0.8 and 1.2  . in these computations",
    "the initial lithium abundance was taken as log n(li)=3.31 , i.e. the solar system abundance given by @xcite @xcite , but the small difference with respect to anders & grevesse ( 1990 ) does not significantly affect our results ] .",
    "both the 2d models and the non  grey fst models show a depletion of the order of @xmath40  dex for the 1  evolutionary track .",
    "thus the non  grey fst models provide a description of the stellar structure very similar to the rhd 2d models , also with respect to lithium depletion .",
    "generally , local convection models are calibrated by requiring that the free parameter(s ) reproduces the solar radius at the solar age .",
    "the mlt models satisfying this constraint predict , however , a pre ",
    "ms lithium depletion which is not compatible with that observed in young open clusters @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the lithium vs. time evolution in some 1  models by @xcite and in the 2d models . as @xcite remarked , the models adopting ah97 atmospheres and @xmath41=1 deplete lithium in pre ",
    "ms by only 0.15  dex .",
    "the same models with @xmath41=1.9 deplete 0.7  dex if the matching point is = 100 , but more than 1  dex for = 10 .",
    "we stress again that this result is only due to the use of a * less efficient convection * when the match with the atmosphere ( @xmath42=1 ) is done at = 100 , even if the @xmath3 parameter chosen for the interior , in order to fit the solar radius , is much larger ( for instance 1.9 ) . as it was shown in @xcite and recalled in sect .  1",
    ", the choice of the optical depth at which we match the two parts of the stellar structure , is not without consequences .",
    "it implies an uncertainty of almost 200  k for the  of 1  pms . _",
    "the optical depth at which the external layers change from adiabatic to over - adiabatic stratification depends on , , and chemical composition as well . to match an @xmath43 structure with an @xmath3=1.9 one at fixed   along the whole evolution",
    "is equivalent to decrease the average efficiency of convection in a complicate , hidden and unjustified way_.    li abundance in young clusters suggests that , if no other physical process is affecting the location of the base of the convective zone , the pms - tracks should be cooler than solar calibrated convection predicts . this evidence should be used to look for the shortcomings of our stellar models .",
    "the location of pre  ms binaries in the hr diagram is a powerful way of constraining stellar models , but unfortunately its indications are , by now , still ambiguous , because of the dearth of systems with well known masses and and good atmospheric parameters . for some of these binaries ,",
    "the location is consistent with models having high convection efficiency , but for others this is not the case . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we compare the 2d tracks with the parameters derived from the observations of four binary systems : rxj 0529.4 + 0041 ( according to the most recent determination by @xcite ) , v1174 ori ( stassun et al .",
    "2004 ) , ntt 045251 + 3016 ( steffen et al . 2001 ) and hd  98800  b @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis is out of the scope of this paper , but it is evident that the agreement is reasonably good for most of the primaries but much less satisfactory for the secondary , i.e. less massive , components .",
    "the v1174  ori primary mass ( 1 ) is consistent with the corresponding 2d  track , as well as the primary masses of rxj 0529.4 + 0041 ( 1.3 ) and hd  98800  b ( 0.699 ) , but that of ntt 045251 + 3016 is rather different from the expected value ( 1.45@xmath440.19 ) is .  away from the @xcite grey  fst tracks , which are hotter than the 2d  tracks by @xmath45270  k. ] besides , at least two secondaries seem to be too cool for the 2d  tracks , and one could perhaps guess a systematic behavior , in the sense that the low mass pms stars seem to be cooler and to have a larger than expected radius .",

    "2005 ; and references therein ) . an accepted , but not definitely proved , explanation is that these larger than expected stellar radii are related to stellar activity .",
    "in fact , the magnetic fields associated with stellar activity can decrease the efficiency of convection ( gough & tayler 1966 ; stein et al .",
    "1992 and references therein ) and as a consequence the stellar radius must grow to transport the same quantity of energy .",
    "besides , the decrease in effective temperature could be due to spots on the stellar surface . in a very recent paper , torres et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have shown that the discrepancy between theory and observation can also appear for stars quite similar to the sun . in their study of the eclipsing binary v1061 cygni with @xmath46  and @xmath47 ,",
    "they conclude : _ `` current stellar evolution models that use a mixing length parameter @xmath48 appropriate for the sun agree well with the properties of the primary , but show a very large divergence in the radius of the secondary , in the sense that the predicted values are @xmath49% smaller than observed .",
    "in addition , the temperature is cooler than predicted by some 200  k ... for a star only 7% less massive than the sun''_. they suggest that there must be a relation among activity level , decrease of  and underestimation of the stellar radii by the standard stellar models ( calibrated by matching the sun ) .",
    "we have considered , until now , 2d  models computed for the  standard \" solar metallicity z=0.02 , but what will happen if we decrease z to @xmath450.013 , as suggested by the re  analysis of the solar spectrum by @xcite ? the lithium depletion would probably be reduced , without affecting too much the pre  ms tracks location , as we still must calibrate convection in order to reproduce the solar location .",
    "rhd 2d models are not available for this revised metallicity , nevertheless , we can compute models with fst convection , and make the hypothesis that , for the reduced solar metallicity , they provide similar results to 2d  models , as they do for the standard solar metallicity .",
    "in fact , the effective temperature in the hayashi track corresponding to the solar model , calibrated with the new solar metallicity , is only 0.3% lower than that for the standard solar metallicity .",
    "however , the temperature and density at the bottom of the convective zone of these pms models , have changed by 6 and 12  % respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "lithium has been depleted only by 0.5  dex .",
    "we recall , however , that the solar model with new solar metallicity is not able to fit either the depth of the convective zone , or the sound speed profile inside the sun .",
    "since the new solar abundances were published , several teams tried to recover the good match between the helioseismic sun and the standard solar model .",
    "they proposed to increase the opacity , the microscopic diffusion coefficients , or a combination of both ( e.g. basu & antia 2004 , montalbn et al .",
    "2004b , guzik et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we recall , that none of the proposed solutions is fully satisfactory .",
    "nevertheless , for what concerns the lithium problem , whatever solution be adopted , it should be able to change the bottom of the convective zone during ms without changing the pms models .",
    "if the discrepancy between the standard solar model and helioseismology could be solved only changing the microscopic diffusion ( not reliable at the moment , see for instance guzik et al .",
    "2005 ) , since this process is very slow , perhaps we could keep a low lithium depletion . for other processes , we should justify why they work during ms and not during solar pms .",
    "basu & antia ( 2005 ) and bahcall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed the solution of increasing the ne abundance ( not directly observed in the solar spectrum ) by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "this suggestion has been supported by drake & testa ( 2005 ) which , on the basis of ne abundance determination in active stars , argue that the solar ne could be 2.5 times larger than the value adopted for the solar mixtures . without entering in the controversy about these new ne abundance determination ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we would like to recall that ne is , with o , one of the main contributors to opacity at the bottom of the solar convective zone ( close to @xmath51 ) .",
    "the solution proposed by basu & antia ( 2005 ) implies to increase the opacity by replacing the decrease of o abundance in the new solar mixture ( asplund et al .",
    "2004 ) by the increase of ne one . a direct comparison between opal opacity tables , with gn93 mixture , and a solar mixture with ne increased by a factor 3.5 yields that the opacity from this latter table , for the temperature and density typical of pms stars , is even larger than for gn93 mixture . as a consequence",
    ", one can predict a deeper convective region in the pms and , therefore , a lithium depletion even larger than in the `` old '' standard solar model .",
    "the computation of mlt pre  ms tracks in which the @xmath3 parameter is calibrated on 2d rhd models ( 2d  tracks ) shows that these tracks deplete too much lithium , at variance with the observations of stars in young open clusters .",
    "the 2d  tracks are similar , in hr diagram location and lithium depletion , to the fst non  grey tracks by @xcite .",
    "thus we compute fst non  grey models , correponding to the new solar metallicity determined by @xcite , as proxies of possible 2d rhd models for the reduced solar metallicity .",
    "the lithium depletion in 1  model has been reduced from 1.7  dex ( with the  old \" solar metallicity ) to @xmath45  0.5  dex . we know , however , that such a low metalllicity is not able to reproduce other , well established , properties of the sun",
    ". hence , much more work shall be done , analyzing all the consequences of the new solar metallicity , before adopting the new abundances as solution of the li problem .",
    "the problem of lithium is therefore not solved in the framework of the numerical simulations of convection . on the contrary ,",
    "2d and 3d numerical simulations imply even more efficient convection in the pms , while lithium depletion in young clusters and pms binaries studied here suggest a lower efficiency .",
    "we conclude that convection in pre ",
    "ms must be less efficient than what is suggested by 2d rhd models .",
    "it is still possible that the description of pre  ms convection requires the introduction of a second parameter linked to the stellar rotation and magnetic field , as we have suggested in the past ( ventura et al .  1998b ; dantona et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the data on masses and radii coming from high quality observations of eclipsing binaries and/or interferometry of late type stars agree only in part with the 2d models .",
    "so , while some observations ( stellar parameters of binaries and lithium abundances in young clusters ) require a low efficiency of convection in the late - type domain of the hr diagram , numerical simulations of convection ( ludwig et al .",
    "1999 ; trampedach et al .",
    "1999 ; ludwig et al .",
    "2000 ) show the opposite : an equivalent value of the @xmath3 parameter that increases as effective temperature decreases .",
    "the abovementioned observational results , together with the high activity level that pms - stars can show ( see e.g. tayler 1987 ) , seems to support the suggestion that that other physical processes ( rotation , magnetic fields ) affect the efficiency of convection in late type stars .",
