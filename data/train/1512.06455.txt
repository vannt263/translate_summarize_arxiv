    "our model ( see material and methods section ) describes the coupled evolution of a quasi - neutral , non - relativistic plasma of collisionless protons ( mass @xmath5 ) , isothermal , fluid electrons of negligible inertia , and electromagnetic fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it formally retains magnetic advection and induction , resistivity and the hall effect but , because of the isothermal - electrons assumption , does not allow for a biermann battery @xcite or weibel - like instabilities @xcite ( these effects only generate very small seed fields and are not themselves viable dynamos ) .",
    "the equations are solved with a 3d-3v eulerian numerical code , in a periodic cubic spatial domain of size @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the ion inertial length , and a velocity - space range of @xmath10 ion thermal speeds @xmath11 .",
    "the system is initialized with a maxwellian ion distribution function of uniform density @xmath12 and temperature @xmath13 , electron temperature @xmath14 , and a magnetic seed in the wavenumber range @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the field strength , characterized by the inverse of @xmath16 , remains small enough ( @xmath17 ) that the hall effect is negligible , but the plasma can self - magnetize if the ion larmor radius @xmath18 becomes smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "an incompressible , non - helical , stochastic external force drives a plasma flow by injecting ion momentum at system scale ( @xmath20 ) with a prescribed average power density @xmath21 . in unmagnetized regimes ,",
    "the plasma is effectively very viscous due to the phase mixing of momentum by streaming ions ( landau damping ) , so the driving generates a smooth ( forcing - scale ) chaotic , subsonic , finite - amplitude flow with a correlation time @xmath22 , smaller by a factor of mach number than the turnover time @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the characteristic mean ion flow velocity .",
    "this differs from fluid dynamo simulations , in which these timescales are comparable , and fast , inertial eddies develop down to viscous scales .",
    "the spatial and velocity - space numerical resolution @xmath25 is close to the current affordable maximum , as characterizing the dynamo requires several simulations which must be integrated for several turnover times with small timesteps to capture fast kinetic physics .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the evolution of magnetic energy in four unmagnetized simulations ( initial @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) with magnetic diffusivities @xmath29\\,{v_{\\mathrm{th}i}}\\,{d_i}$ ] ( magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath30 $ ] ) and all other parameters fixed . the results are a conclusive demonstration of plasma dynamo , with sustained magnetic growth only occurring above a critical @xmath31 at this value of @xmath32 .",
    "the magnetic energy growth rate is @xmath33 for the largest @xmath34 considered .",
    "adimensionalized magnetic - energy density @xmath35 in forced simulations with decreasing magnetic diffusivities .",
    "the flow history is identical for all simulations .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath20 , @xmath37 , @xmath28 , and @xmath38 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] ( see also supplementary movie 1 ) shows two - dimensional snapshots of magnetic - field strength and the corresponding energy spectra for the growing case .",
    "the field is stretched chaotically by velocity fluctuations and develops a characteristic folded structure with reversals perpendicular to the field at the resistive scale @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the trend of the spectral evolution is consistent with the formation of a @xmath40 kazantsev energy spectrum @xcite down to @xmath41 .",
    "these results are reminiscent of a large - magnetic - prandtl number  stretch and fold  mhd dynamo @xcite ( @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the kinematic viscosity ) .",
    "considering that the collisionless plasma flow is effectively very viscous , it is perhaps not a surprise that its dynamo action is similar to that of a random `` stokes flow '' @xcite .",
    "however , the critical @xmath34 is significantly larger than in mhd .",
    "we attribute this effect to the shorter correlation time of collisionless eddies , which limits their capacity to stretch the field in a sustained fashion .     at increasing times ( grey circles in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in the @xmath44 simulation ( darker regions correspond to stronger fields , the colormap is clipped to the amplitude range of each snapshot to highlight magnetic structures ) .",
    "bottom : corresponding magnetic spectra ( darker lines encode increasing times).[fig2 ] ]",
    "as the dynamo demonstrated above proceeds , it will take the plasma from an unmagnetized to a magnetized regime .",
    "covering the full transition is currently computationally prohibitive , as it requires integrating the 3d-3v kinetic system over many ( system - scale ) fluid turnover times .",
    "we instead investigated how magnetization affects magnetic growth using several shorter simulations initialized with seed fields of identical spatial form but different strengths ( @xmath32 @xmath45 @xmath46 $ ] ) , using the same power input and @xmath47 as in the marginally stable @xmath31 , @xmath26 case .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows that the magnetic - energy growth rate increases markedly with decreasing @xmath32 , leading to the conclusion that magnetic growth is self - accelerating , and by implication that the critical rm is lower at lower @xmath32 ( stronger seed field ) .    ) .",
    "inset : magnetic - energy growth rate versus @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath20 , @xmath37 , @xmath48.[fig3 ] ]    we observe a transition between a `` fluid - like '' inductive regime , and a mixed fluid - kinetic growth regime . figure  [ fig4 ] ( see also supplementary movie 2 ) shows that ion pressure anisotropies @xmath49 develop with respect to the local field in the most magnetized @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) case ( @xmath52 is the ion pressure tensor , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) .",
    "magnetic field lines develop an angular shape in strong field - curvature regions of negative @xmath56 , a nonlinear signature of the firehose instability , while bubbly mirror - like fluctuations are excited in regions of positive @xmath56 where the field is stretched ( small - scale magnetic depressions are associated with overdensities , see inset in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "relaxation of @xmath56 is observed at later times in both regions .",
    "these results are consistent with theoretical expectations @xcite and with a scenario in which magnetization and kinetic - scale fluctuations , by impeding the free streaming of ions , enhancing particle scattering and regulating pressure anisotropy , result in more vigorous turbulent field amplification through an effective reduction of flow viscosity @xcite .",
    "higher - resolution simulations with longer integration times than can be afforded currently are required to investigate growth in this regime quantitatively .",

    "inset : close - up on field lines and scalar density fluctuations in the central , mirror - unstable region ( the red / blue colorscale encodes @xmath58 clipped to @xmath57).[fig4 ] ]",
    "this paper offers a conclusive proof - of - principle demonstration that turbulent collisionless plasma dynamo is possible .",
    "this effect involves generic plasma processes independent of any particular geometric configuration and may thus be realizable in `` laboratory - astrophysics '' plasma experiments , provided they can achieve sufficiently weak collisionality . numerical evidence that the dynamo becomes entangled with kinetic - scale dynamical phenomena as the plasma self - magnetizes strongly suggests that future models of weakly - collisional , magnetized turbulence in high - energy astrophysical plasmas should at least include an effective treatment of such multiscale interactions . for the time being , and while reconstructing the detailed history of cosmological magnetic fields remains out of reach observationally and computationally , our results provide a firmer physical basis for the idea that extragalactic plasma turbulence may significantly contribute to the amplification of seed cosmological fields up to dynamical levels on cosmologically short times , despite such plasmas not being simple collisional mhd fluids .",
    "the typical magnetic - field amplification timescale in the unmagnetized regime is an appreciable fraction of the eddy turnover time , and our results suggest that the dynamo self - accelerates as magnetization takes place . in the turbulent icm",
    "where the turnover time is believed to be no longer than @xmath59 years , probably much shorter @xcite , such a dynamo could therefore in principle bring magnetic fields from typical @xmath60 ( at most ) gauss seed field magnitudes @xcite to @xmath0gauss dynamical levels in less than a hubble time .",
    "new supercomputing and experimental facilities should soon make it possible to determine the parameter dependence and saturation properties of this turbulent dynamo and to further assess its relevance to the coevolutions of cosmic magnetic fields and large - scale accreting structures , which are also set to be thoroughly investigated by next - generation x - ray and radio observatories .",
    "we consider a forced , non - relativistic , quasi - neutral hybrid vlasov - maxwell system describing the coupled evolution of collisionless protons ( mass @xmath5 , charge @xmath61 ) , fluid , isothermal electrons of temperature @xmath62 and negligible inertia , and electromagnetic fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the spatial and velocity space coordinates ) .",
    "the ion distribution function @xmath67 is governed by the vlasov equation @xmath68\\cdot{{\\frac{\\partial { f_i}}{\\partial { { { \\ensuremath\\mathbf{v}}}}}}}=0~,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is an external force described below .",
    "the ion number density is @xmath70 , the mean `` fluid '' ion velocity is @xmath71 , and the ion pressure tensor is @xmath72 .",
    "the electron number density @xmath73 is equal to @xmath74 at all times by quasi - neutrality .",
    "the magnetic field evolution is governed by faraday s equation , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the electric field is calculated from ohm s law , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the current density , @xmath79 is the mean electron velocity , and @xmath80 is a uniform magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the equations are adimensionalized using the initially uniform ion density @xmath12 as a reference density , the ion inertial length @xmath81 , as a length scale ( @xmath82 ) , and @xmath83 as a timescale .",
    "@xmath7 is expressed in units of @xmath84 , and @xmath6 in units of @xmath85 .",
    "the adimensional magnetic energy density is the inverse of the plasma @xmath32",
    "the problem is solved numerically with a 3d-3v eulerian vlasov code @xcite parallelized on 1024 cores . the resistive term in ohm s law is only included in faraday s equation to ensure that dynamo modes are numerically resolved .",
    "an incompressible , non - helical , delta - correlated in time vector force @xmath69 injecting ion momentum with a prescribed statistical power density @xmath86 is included in the numerical formulation of the ion vlasov equation using a numerical technique borrowed from hydrodynamics @xcite . defining the correlation tensor of the spatial fourier transform of the force as @xmath87 where brackets denote ensemble averaging , it can be shown analytically that the ( linear ) response to this forcing in unmagnetized , collisionless regimes is a time - dependent flow @xmath88 whose correlation tensor is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the plasma dispersion function @xcite . for the forcing parameters considered here",
    ", we checked that the correlation tensor of the actual subsonic , chaotic flow driven at @xmath91 in unmagnetized simulations is of this form to a very good approximation , with an effective correlation time @xmath22 .",
