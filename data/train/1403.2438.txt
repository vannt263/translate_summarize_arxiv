    "after more than a decade and a half of surveys for brown dwarf variability we now know that the emergent spectrum of many l- and t- type brown dwarfs indeed varies with time .",
    "broadband , near - infrared flux variations can be as large as 1030% , can occur on timescales from 1100  hours , and can be non - periodic .",
    "spectroscopic and multi - band photometric studies have revealed complex , wavelength - dependent lightcurves @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "spectra show periodic brightness fluctuations with wavelength - dependent phase lags , which can be as large as 180@xmath0 ( i.e. , shifted by half of a cycle ) @xcite .",
    "clouds sculpt the emergent spectra of essentially all spectral classes of brown dwarfs , although their impact is most notable in the l - dwarfs .",
    "given the strong evidence for the presence of clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres , and the ability of a continuum opacity source to limit the depth of the wavelength - dependent photosphere , it is expected that these structures play some role in brightness variability @xcite .",
    "indeed thermal emission from the deep atmospheres of both jupiter and saturn is strongly modulated by cloud structures and jupiter itself would show substantial variability if the disk were observed at 5  @xmath1 m in integrated light . however",
    "the intensity of radiation emitted by a planetary or brown dwarf atmosphere depends on many factors in addition to cloud structure .",
    "atmospheric temperature and composition also control the thermal emission and it seems prudent to also consider the role such factors might contribute to variability .",
    "@xcite used a 2-d radiation hydrodynamics model to study atmospheric circulation and dust transport in m - dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "this work highlighted the importance of gravity waves and dust convection to maintaining clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "they found that gravity waves are expected to be ubiquitous above the radiative - convective boundary and likely play an important role in cloud development and evolution .",
    "more recently , global 3-d , cloud - free models were used by to study large - scale flows and convection in the interiors and deep atmospheres of brown dwarfs .",
    "these models revealed that convection is strongly influenced by the relatively fast rotation rates of brown dwarfs and that thermal variations of order several kelvin may be expected at the top of the model convective zone .",
    "this work also discussed a stratospheric circulation , driven by the interaction between atmospheric waves generated at the top of the convective zone and the mean stratospheric flow , that could lead to large ( @xmath250  k ) temperature variations in the upper atmospheres of brown dwarfs .",
    "however , emission spectra were not computed , and so the influence of these variations on the brown dwarfs spectra remain unclear .    here",
    "we provide a case study of the impact of atmospheric temperature fluctuations on the emission spectrum of a brown dwarf .",
    "we intentionally simplify the problem by neglecting clouds as well as chemical evolution , thus allowing us to explore the behaviors , timescales , and related spectral variability due to temperature fluctuations alone . using a new 1-d , time - stepping radiative convective model for brown dwarfs ,",
    "we first investigate the heating of an atmosphere due to an extended thermal pulse from deep within the convective zone .",
    "we then explore variability in the emission spectrum due to time - varying thermal fluctuations , introducing these perturbations at different atmospheric levels , and highlighting circumstances where the model can reproduce wavelength - dependent phase lags .",
    "we adapt a well - validated thermal structure model of brown dwarfs @xcite to permit realistic time - stepping , thus permitting studies of the time - dependent evolution of atmospheric thermal pulses .",
    "we take the atmosphere to be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the heating rate , @xmath3 , throughout the atmospheric profile is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is temperature , @xmath6 is time , @xmath7 is the acceleration due to gravity , which we take to be constant over the small range of altitudes encompassed by the atmosphere , @xmath8 is the temperature- and pressure - dependent specific heat capacity , @xmath9 is the net energy flux , carried by both radiation and convection , and @xmath10 is pressure .",
    "values for the specific heat are taken from the equation of state models of @xcite .",
    "gas opacities in our model are computed according to @xcite , and chemical abundances of all radiatively active species are provided by the equilibrium models of @xcite and . for a given pressure - temperature ( @xmath10-@xmath5 ) profile and set of gas composition profiles , the upwelling and downwelling thermal fluxes are computed for 180 wavelength bins , spanning 0.4325  @xmath1 m . within each spectral interval ,",
    "the two - stream source function technique @xcite is used to solve the equation of radiative transfer within discrete spectral bins using eight - term , correlated-@xmath11 coefficients .",
    "the convective heat flux , @xmath12 , is computed according to mixing length theory , and is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass density , @xmath15 is the eddy diffusivity for heat , @xmath16 is altitude , and @xmath17 is the adiabatic lapse rate .",
    "the eddy diffusivity vanishes when the temperature profile is stable against convection , and is given by @xmath18^{1/2 } , &       \\frac{dt}{dz } > - \\gamma_{\\text{ad } }   \\\\ 0 , &   \\frac{dt}{dz }   \\leq - \\gamma_{\\text{ad } }    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the mixing length , which we set equal to the pressure scale height , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath1 is the atmospheric mean molecular mass .",
    "we tested sensitivity to our mixing length parameterization by running simulations with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and found negligible differences in model outputs .",
    "time - stepping in our model proceeds in a straightforward , linear fashion . a time increment , @xmath25 ,",
    "is selected that is short enough to maintain stability in the convective region of the atmosphere .",
    "typically , @xmath25 of order 0.11  s suffices , which is about 1/10 of the convective timescale for a single model layer .",
    "given a @xmath10-@xmath5 profile at time @xmath6 , the temperature at level @xmath26 is updated according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the heating rate at model pressure level @xmath26 .",
    "our pressure grid contains 68 levels between 90  bar and @xmath29  bar which are , roughly , equally spaced in log - pressure .",
    "the wall - clock time of each model time - step is much less than one second , due to the computational efficiency of our radiation and convection schemes .",
    "we verified that the time - stepping model s equilibrium @xmath10-@xmath5 curve and depth of the convective zone agreed with previous versions of our model , which found equilibrium solutions using a newton - raphson technique .    in this case study",
    ", we use a model t dwarf with an effective temperature of 900  k and a surface gravity of @xmath30  cm  s@xmath31 .",
    "this set of parameters was previously found to produce steady - state models that reproduce observations of a variable t6.5 brown dwarf , 2mass  j22282889431026 @xcite .",
    "note that the best - fit models for this case included thin clouds of na@xmath32s , mns , and cr , which , as mentioned earlier , we intentionally omit .",
    "figure  [ fig : confuncs_spec_temp ] shows the modeled emission spectrum , wavelength- and pressure - dependent normalized contribution functions @xcite , and equilibrium @xmath10-@xmath5 profile for this object , and also shows the observed spex spectrum @xcite .",
    "the contribution functions show the range of pressures that contribute information to the top - of - atmosphere spectrum ( i.e. , the wavelength - dependent specific flux exiting the atmosphere to space ) , and the pressure at the base of the atmospheric simulations was chosen to extend below the deepest pressures probed by the spectra ( which occurs primarily at visible wavelengths ) .",
    "relevant near - infrared bandpasses are also shown , which , for example , demonstrate that the irac1 filter is sensitive to lower pressures ( higher altitudes ) than is j - band .",
    "small discrepancies at continuum wavelengths between the modeled and observed spectra are due to our omission of clouds . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig : confuncs_spec_temp ] also shows a @xmath10-@xmath5 profile from a cloudy model @xcite that was shown to reproduce a time - averaged spectrum of the aforementioned 2mass object in @xcite . as was shown in @xcite , models of this object that include clouds place these relatively deep in the atmosphere , with several different cloud decks forming below 2 bar .",
    "our contribution functions demonstrate that there are wavelength regions below 1.7  @xmath1 m ( between the strong water bands ) which are sensitive to these pressures . as a result , a model spectrum that includes clouds has less flux at these continuum wavelengths .",
    "we proceed with two key investigations in our case study .",
    "first , we use our time - stepping model to study the monotonic heating of a brown dwarf atmosphere due to an energy source at depth .",
    "the focus of this investigation is to understand how the deep atmosphere communicates energy to the upper , radiatively - dominated levels of the atmosphere .",
    "second , we introduce periodic perturbations at different levels of the atmosphere .",
    "we do not specify the mechanism driving these fluctuations , but energy sources could include dynamics , atmospheric wave breaking ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cloud radiative and latent heating affects , and/or other processes . as different wavelengths in the top - of - atmosphere spectrum probe different pressures , we show how the time - dependent perturbations lead to complex behavior in the emergent spectrum .",
    "we can gain insight into the time - dependent response of a brown dwarf atmosphere to a perturbation by varying the bottom boundary condition , which is the internal heat flux .",
    "this flux is equal to @xmath33 , where sigma is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath34 is the dwarf s effective temperature . for our @xmath35",
    "k body , this flux is nominally @xmath36  w  m@xmath31 .",
    "we study the response of the atmosphere , initially in equilibrium , to a 10% increase in this flux , to @xmath37  w  m@xmath31 ( or @xmath38  k ) .    figure  [ fig : heating_temps ] shows the time - dependent evolution of atmospheric temperatures , relative to the equilibrium profile shown in figure  [ fig : confuncs_spec_temp ] .",
    "a curve is shown for every 20  hours of evolution , and brighter hues show later times .",
    "the convective portion of the atmosphere , which is below 40  bar , heats nearly uniformly , while the upper portions of the atmosphere lag behind , which is because the convective timescale ( @xmath20.11  hours ) is short compared to the radiative timescale ( @xmath210100  hours ) .",
    "note that the new equilibrium temperatures , shown by the dashed curve , are about 12% larger than the initial equilibrium state .",
    "also , this figure demonstrates that the characteristic timescale at which the atmosphere responds to the perturbation at depth is @xmath39 hours .    despite the perturbation being introduced at the base of the atmosphere , at 90  bar",
    ", we see that the upper atmosphere is already beginning to heat by several tens of hours into the simulation , and achieves its maximum heating rate at about 120 hours into the simulation . to understand this behavior , we investigated the wavelength- and pressure - dependent radiative heating rates at 120 hours into the run .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig : heating_rates ] . here",
    ", different vertical sub - figures are for different pressures in the atmosphere , at @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 bar .",
    "the horizontal axis is wavelength , and the vertical axis is the specific heating rate ( in k  day@xmath45  @xmath1m@xmath45 ) .",
    "the dotted curve is the integrated heating rate , ( in k  day@xmath45 ) . for convenience , a scaled version of the top - of - atmosphere spectrum",
    "is shown in light grey in the top sub - figure .",
    "investigation of the radiative heating rates in figure  [ fig : heating_rates ] shows that the upper - most portions of the atmosphere are responding to increases in radiative fluxes at short wavelengths ( below about 2  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "heating at these levels occurs primarily in the wings of water vapor absorption bands .",
    "the opacity at band centers is too large for the upper atmosphere to  see \" flux from the deep atmosphere , and there is not enough opacity in window regions at low pressures for significant flux to be absorbed , which would drive heating at these levels .      to investigate periodic variability",
    ", we artificially introduce a sinusoidally - varying heating rate to our model atmosphere at different pressures .",
    "this perturbation is in addition to the heating / cooling due to gradients in the net radiative and convective fluxes that occur as the atmosphere evolves through time .",
    "thus , equation  [ eqn : heating ] is now @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the amplitude of the fluctuation ( in degrees kelvin per unit time ) , @xmath48 is the fluctuation period , @xmath49 is the dirac delta function , and @xmath50 is the pressure where the fluctuation is introduced . in practice ,",
    "since model levels are discretized , the heating perturbation is introduced over a small range of model pressures .",
    "we choose @xmath50 as either the base of the atmosphere ( near 100 bar ) , at 10 bar , or at 1 bar , and study the quasi - steady - state behavior over the course of entire fluctuation cycle .",
    "the timescales we investigate are 10 , 50 , 100 , and 500  hours , and @xmath47 is selected for each run so that the temperature at the perturbed level varies by 1% over a cycle ( i.e. , 20  k variation at the base , 13  k at 10  bar , and 8  k at 1 bar ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we do not specify the mechanism that drives these fluctuations , but possible sources include dynamics , wave breaking , cloud effects , and/or other processes .",
    "figure  [ fig : variability ] shows a grid of model results for the different perturbation pressures and timescales . the horizontal axis is time , which spans one full perturbation cycle , and the vertical axis is wavelength through the near - infrared .",
    "contours show the relative changes in the brightness of the top - of - atmosphere spectrum ( @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the brightness averaged over a full cycle ) .",
    "recall that the contribution functions in figure  [ fig : confuncs_spec_temp ] allow us to map between wavelength and the pressure levels that contribute flux at that wavelength .",
    "a set of lightcurves , from the case with a perturbation introduced at the base of the atmosphere with a period of 100  hours in figure  [ fig : variability ] , are shown for several different bandpasses in figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] .",
    "these bandpasses were chosen as a subset of those used in @xcite , and highlight the wavelength - dependent phase lag produced by our model .",
    "the models with time - varying perturbations demonstrate a number of complex behaviors , including wavelength - dependent phase lags . of note",
    "are the cases where the perturbations are introduced high in the atmosphere ( 1 bar ) . here , regardless of the timescale of the perturbation , the deeper atmospheric levels , which are probed by the shorter wavelengths , do not experience substantial temperature fluctuations , and so we see little or no variability at shorter wavelengths . to understand this behavior ,",
    "we explore the radiative response timescales in the atmosphere , which are shown in figure  [ fig : timescales ] .",
    "we estimate the timescale at which atmospheric level @xmath26 responds to a small ( 1% ) temperature increase , @xmath53 , in level @xmath54 by computing the profile of net radiative heating in response to this perturbation .",
    "this timescale is then @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the radiative heating rate at level @xmath26 after the perturbation is applied .",
    "as figure  [ fig : timescales ] shows , these timescales are from @xmath21  hr for levels near the perturbation , to @xmath2@xmath57  hr for levels far from the perturbation , with timescales tending to be longer for deep levels responding to perturbations at low pressures .",
    "brown dwarf variability is influenced by a number of physical processes , each operating at its own timescale and spatial scale .",
    "commensurate with these variations will be thermal fluctuations , possibly due to convective motions , atmospheric wave breaking , or perhaps latent and/or cloud heating effects .",
    "the model investigations presented here explore the evolution of such thermal fluctuations .",
    "our simplest case is an atmosphere heated from below , where the internal heat flux is increased , and the thermal structure is allowed to adjust .",
    "temperatures throughout the column increase by 12% on timescales of order 100 hours . as figure",
    "[ fig : heating_temps ] demonstrates , there is clear communication between the deep atmosphere ( at pressures larger than @xmath210 bar ) and the upper atmosphere ( at pressures smaller than @xmath20.1 bar ) .",
    "the radiative heating rates ( figure  [ fig : heating_rates ] ) show that a substantial amount of heating in the upper atmosphere is due to radiation absorbed below about 2  @xmath1 m .",
    "the deep atmosphere , which is at temperatures of 1500 - 2000  k , contributes substantial thermal emission at these wavelengths ( about 40% of the flux from a 1750  k blackbody is emitted shortward of 2  @xmath1 m ) , and the atmosphere is relatively transparent here , too ( figure  [ fig : confuncs_spec_temp ] ) .    our investigation of heating from below shows that the timescale at which the atmosphere responds is distinct from the level radiative response timescales presented in figure  [ fig : timescales ] .",
    "the latter simply relates a perturbation at a single level to a response timescale at all other atmospheric levels , whereas the former is a phenomenological timescale associated with the communication and passage of a heating ( or cooling ) pulse through the atmospheric column .",
    "when we let a perturbation evolve in time , as when we increase the internal heat flux into the model atmosphere , we see that levels near the perturbed level respond rapidly ( at the level radiative response timescale ) , and this communication is efficiently passed upward through the atmospheric column .",
    "thus , the level radiative response timescales tend to over - estimate the timescales for communicating thermal pulses over large pressure ranges .",
    "a key feature of the radiative response times shown in figure  [ fig : timescales ] is their asymmetry in communicating a perturbation upward versus downward through the atmosphere .",
    "the deep atmosphere responds more slowly to perturbations above than _",
    "vice versa_. this is , in part , a column mass effect  an equal mass of material ( per unit area ) is located in a column extending from the top of the atmosphere to 1  bar as is located between 1  bar and 2  bar . additionally , as was mentioned above , while the deep atmosphere is at high enough temperatures to emit a substantial amount of flux at the short wavelengths where the atmosphere is relatively transparent , the upper atmosphere is too cool to contribute much thermal flux at these wavelengths ( less than 1% of the flux from a 500  k blackbody is emitted shortward of 2  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the role of radiative response timescales , and their asymmetry between the deep atmosphere and the upper atmosphere , is apparent in fluctuations in the top - of - atmosphere spectrum when periodic heating perturbations are imposed at different pressures in our model atmosphere ( figure  [ fig : variability ] ) . when the perturbation is introduced at the base of the atmosphere ( 90  bar ) , and the perturbation timescale is short ( @xmath58  hr ) , the upper atmosphere does not respond , and we see no variability in the spectrum between 25  @xmath1 m ( which probe lower pressures in the atmosphere ) . as the timescale of the perturbation increases , the fluctuations become apparent at lower pressures . for the longest timescale fluctuations investigated here ( 500  hr )",
    ", the entire atmosphere column responds nearly in unison to the perturbation at depth .",
    "when the perturbation is introduced at 10  bar , we see that the fluctuations at lower pressures ( longer wavelengths ) becomes apparent at shorter timescales .",
    "we do not see fluctuations near 1.1 and 1.3  @xmath1 m , which probe deeper pressures , since the perturbation can not be communicated as efficiently into the deep atmosphere .",
    "similar behaviors are seen when the perturbation is introduced at 1  bar , except that communication to pressures smaller than this occurs at shorter timescales , and so the fluctuations in the top - of - atmosphere spectrum look similar across a wide range of perturbation timescales .",
    "the asymmetry in radiative response timescales then indicates an important potential observable , since spectral fluctuations due to thermal perturbations at lower pressures will be distinct from those occurring at depth .",
    "specifically , variability at wavelengths that probe the upper atmosphere , and a lack of variability at wavelengths that probe the deep atmosphere , indicates a perturbation occurring higher in the atmosphere .",
    "perturbations occurring at depth will be apparent at the wavelengths that probe higher pressures , and can generate spectral variability at other wavelengths , depending on the timescale of the perturbation .    while the extremes of the response of an atmosphere to a perturbation is uniform heating / cooling ( at long timescales ) and strictly local heating / cooling ( at short timescales )",
    ", complex behavior arises in between these extremes , and is rooted in the different timescales at which an atmospheric level is responding to perturbations in all other levels .",
    "wavelength - dependent phase lagging is apparent in some cases in figure  [ fig : variability ] , primarily at wavelengths below 2  @xmath1 m , where the top - of - atmosphere spectrum probes a wide range of pressures over a relatively small range of wavelengths , although phase lags at longer wavelengths are also apparent .",
    "we note that our case with a perturbation introduced at the base of the atmosphere on a timescale of 100 hours produces brightness fluctuations whose wavelength dependence bear a similarity to those observed in @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] ) . like the observations reported by buenzli  et  al . , the amplitude of the model fluctuations is typically of order 13% , and the flux measured in a 1.351.43  @xmath1 m bandpass lags the flux measured in a 1.211.32  @xmath1 m bandpass ( by 140@xmath0 in our model , as compared to @xmath2180@xmath0 in the observations ) .",
    "however , our model can not explain all of the details of the observations .",
    "most importantly , the brown dwarf varies on roughly hour - long timescales , which is comparable to the rotation period and probably reflects the complex , three - dimensional nature of the atmosphere .",
    "in contrast , our model perturbation timescales are closer to 100  hours .",
    "this is likely a shortcoming of using a one - dimensional model , although we note that the observations reported by @xcite do show brightness trends on timescales longer than 10  hours .",
    "thus , in summary , our results show that thermal fluctuations can be an important aspect of spectral variability , while also pointing to the necessary role of dynamics and clouds in fully explaining observations .",
    "future studies should examine the interconnected role of thermal perturbations and cloud and chemical evolution on thermal variability .",
    "clouds typically act as a continuum opacity source .",
    "thus , clouds will limit sensitivity to thermal fluctuations occurring in atmospheric layers beneath the cloud base ( i.e. , those layers probed at window / continuum wavelengths in the cloud - free case ) , and this effect will be stronger for more optically thick clouds .",
    "alternatively , clouds will shield deeper atmospheric layers from thermal perturbations that are propagating downwards , preventing those layers from heating / cooling as they would in a cloud - free scenario . of course",
    ", clouds are not a steady - state process , and so will respond with their own characteristic timescales when other atmospheric layers are perturbed from their equilibrium state . for example , if an amount of flux , @xmath59 , across a cloud with column mass @xmath60 ( analogous to liquid water path for earth clouds ) goes into vaporizing the cloud particles , then a characteristic timescale would be @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the latent heat of vaporization . thus , there is the potential for interesting feedbacks to occur , where the atmosphere is attempting to respond at one timescale ( like those discussed in this work ) , while the clouds are evolving at another timescale .    finally , as the ability of different layers in the atmosphere to influence one another via",
    "radiation hinges on the relatively clear opacity spectral windows found in t - dwarf atmospheres .",
    "l - dwarfs , with stronger cloud and molecular continuum opacity which partially fill in the spectral windows , may accordingly exhibit less radiative coupling between layers , longer response timescales , and perhaps smaller phase shifts between different spectral bandpasses .",
    "larger systematic surveys into brown dwarf variability should investigate such possibilities , not to mention the three - dimensional roles of atmospheric dynamics as coupled to rotation .",
    "using a one - dimensional model of brown dwarf atmospheric structure , we have studied the time - dependent evolution of the atmosphere in response to a variety of thermal perturbations .",
    "we omitted cloud and dynamical effects , choosing to concentrate on behaviors that arise strictly due to atmospheric thermal variations .",
    "thermal perturbations of the deep atmosphere can be communicated to the upper atmosphere at shorter near - infrared wavelengths , although communication in the opposite direction is impeded by the lack of flux generated at these wavelengths by the relatively cool upper atmosphere .",
    "the response timescale of the atmosphere to thermal perturbations is typically 10100  hours .",
    "deep thermal perturbations can lead to brightness fluctuations at nearly all near - infrared wavelengths , and our model predicts that these could be observed on timescales of hundreds of hours .",
    "while it is not our goal to solve the entire problem of brown dwarf variability , our model can produce a number of the observed features , depending on the nature of the thermal perturbation . in the future",
