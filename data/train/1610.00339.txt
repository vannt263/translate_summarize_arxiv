    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , depends on the strength of the polarization of the electron gas and would dominate for strong spin polarization . in turn , for weak spin polarization ( @xmath85 , where @xmath86 ) , this term is negligible and the @xmath67 and @xmath39 interactions dominate .",
    "another point to note is that the essential ingredient for the presence of the dm interactions is the broken symmetry ( time reversal or inversion or both ) . in the original dm work@xcite ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) provided the mechanism for the magnetic interaction .",
    "the interaction between the magnetic moments of two atoms occurred via an intermediate atom and involved the spin - orbit coupled excited states on the two atoms . in this case , as originally showed by dm , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the spin - orbit coupling strength ( @xmath91 ) , so that @xmath92 , @xmath90 being a small parameter , and it is then customary to ignore the tensor dm interaction @xmath93 . in the present case , the broken time - reversal symmetry without the involvement of any soc leads to the dm interaction , so that it is entirely a different mechanism , and further that the strengths of all terms are comparable , being proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "thus , in a solid , if a spin - polarized electron gas is present in addition to magnetic moments on atoms with soc , both effects must be considered separately and the dominant effect for the dm interactions might as well come from the spin polarization of the electron gas , of the type studied in this paper .",
