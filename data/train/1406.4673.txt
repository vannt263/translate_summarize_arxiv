    "quantum chaos is concerned with the behavior of high - frequency laplacian eigenfunctions @xmath1 and their seemingly chaotic properties . apart from highly particular cases which are usually characterized by completely integrable behavior of the geodesic flow",
    ", these eigenfunctions will appear to be somewhat random. indeed , should the behavior be not chaotic , then usually any small perturbation of the geometry of the domain will induce chaotic behavior : randomness is the generic case .",
    "it is of great interest to try to understand this randomness by specifying arising invariants .",
    "some central questions of quantum chaos are    1 .   whether ( and under which conditions on the geometry of the manifold ) the @xmath2mass of the eigenfunctions tends towards uniform distribution  recent spectacular breakthroughs due to anantharaman @xcite and lindenstrauss @xcite .",
    "2 .   whether most eigenfunctions behave like random waves , i.e. whether for example @xmath3 3 .   how many nodal domains there are ( see @xcite for the random wave model and @xcite for deterministic bounds ) and how their volume is distributed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the number of nodal domains has received particular interest : in a highly influental paper by blum , gnutzmann & smilansky @xcite , a universality statement for the number of nodal domains has been conjectured and numerically investigated : a generic laplacian eigenfunction associated to the @xmath4th eigenvalue seems to have @xmath5 nodal domains .",
    "bogomolny & schmit @xcite have worked out a percolation model simulating eigenfunctions in which the observation of blum , gnutzmann & smilansky is confirmed : their model predicts that the number of nodal domains of the @xmath4th eigenfunction is distributed with @xmath6 it is not yet understood to what extent these numbers are precise outside the model ( recent numerical work of konrad @xcite suggests the mean to be @xmath7 smaller ) , however , they are certainly very good approximations .",
    "we are interested in the distribution of the local extrema of a laplacian eigenfunction on a two - dimensional smooth surface with non - integrable geodesic flow .",
    "a cornerstone of existing conjectures is the random wave heuristic , which asserts that for all practical purposes a laplacian eigenfunction should behave like a superposition of random plane waves @xmath8 where @xmath9 are random reals and @xmath10 is a randomly chosen direction normalized to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the energy / eigenvalue .",
    "longuet - higgins @xcite studied this heuristic in a pioneering 1957 paper , which suggests that the @xmath13th laplacian eigenfunction on a compact two - dimensional surface should have @xmath14 extrema .",
    "the random wave approximation is of fundamental importance as its framework allows for precise computations while precise mathematical result seem still out of reach : for example , one would expect ( see e.g. yau @xcite ) that the nodal length has a @xmath15dimensional hausdorff measure of size @xmath16 while the currently best rigorous results in dimensions @xmath17 @xcite do not even rule out the possibility that the nodal length might tend to 0 as @xmath18 .",
    "+ it is natural to try simpler examples ; a prime candidate is a reduction to finite graphs @xmath19 . given a finite , simple , connected graph @xmath20 the natural analogue of the laplacian is the discrete graph - laplacian ( see e.g. @xcite ) given by a @xmath21-matrix @xmath22 with entries @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the degree of the vertex @xmath25 .",
    "the first few eigenvalues / eigenvectors of the matrix will then approximate the first few eigenvalues / eigenfunctions of the laplacian with neumann boundary condition ( for details we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see that as the graph increases in size , it may be used to approximate the given geometry to any arbitrary degree of accuracy ; however , counting nodal domains on graphs is rather difficult .",
    "clearly , if two vertices @xmath26 are joined by an edge e @xmath27 and the eigenfunction satisfies @xmath28 , one would say that the edge crosses the nodal domain  the lack of continuity does not allow for an immediate transfer of the definition from the continuous case . indeed , nodal domains of eigenfunctions on graphs are an ongoing field of great interest ( see e.g. davies , gladwell , leydold & stadler @xcite , dekel , lee & linial @xcite or the survey @xcite ) but difficulty in transferring even very classical theorems from the continuous to the discrete setting pose a difficulty .",
    "in contrast , an extremum of a function is topologically simpler than that of a nodal domain and more easily generalized to the setting of a graph .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * contribution 1 . *",
    "our first contribution is that grid graphs with a small number of added edges behave like continuous surfaces with respect to the number of extrema of eigenfunctions and recover longuet - higgins prediction .",
    "we also computed random wave approximations on both @xmath29 and @xmath30 to allow for comparison .",
