    "consequently , the exactly known leading singularities at @xmath149 in the frequency - dependent spin autocorrelation function @xmath150 , as worked out in ref .  , for example , are not attributable to specific @xmath148-fermion excitations , because the integrated intensity of each @xmath148-fermion contribution taken in isolation is likely to vanish in the limit @xmath137 .    to reconstruct the spectral - weight distribution of @xmath12 at @xmath3 and to determine its singularity structure in the limit @xmath137 from finite-@xmath13 data for excitation energies and transition rates we need to be able to properly handle bethe wave functions with critical pairs of rapidities .",

    "[ sec : ii ] ) how to solve the bethe ansatz equations for all eigenstates in the limit @xmath151 .",
    "one challenging problem for the calculation of transition rates is that bethe wave functions with critical pairs thus obtained vanish identically as pointed out in ref .  .",
