    "by using the advanced technique , it is experimentally possible to explore the properties of the superconducting state under the high pressure ( @xmath11 ) . in particular , the above researches enable : ( i ) the test of the theories for the superconducting state , ( ii ) as well as to improve the properties of the superconductors , and ( iii ) to create the new superconductors . at present , the @xmath12 elemental superconductors are known , however @xmath13 of them superconduct if the pressure is applied @xcite .",
    "the most interesting elements are : lithium , where the critical temperature ( @xmath14 ) rises rapidly to @xmath15 k at @xmath16 gpa @xcite , yttrium with the maximum value of the critical temperature of @xmath17 k at @xmath18 gpa @xcite , and calcium which has the highest observed value of @xmath14 ( @xmath19 k at @xmath20 gpa ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the superconductors under the high pressure can be analyzed in the framework of the eliashberg approach @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this formalism",
    "the complicated form of the electron - phonon interaction is modeled by eliashberg function ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we notice that the first - principle calculations of @xmath21 require the knowledge of the electronic wave functions , the phonon spectrum , and the electron - phonon matrix elements between two single - electron bloch states .",
    "experimentally , the form of the eliashberg function can be directly obtained from the second derivative of @xmath22-@xmath23 curve for the tunnel junction ( @xmath24 ) @xcite .    from the physical point of view",
    ", the eliashberg approach represents particularly important method of the analysis , since it enables the calculation of the thermodynamic parameters on the quantitative level .",
    "in particular , the exact form of the free energy difference between the superconducting and normal state should be calculated on the basis of the so - called eliashberg equations @xcite . in the considered case ,",
    "the input parameters are the eliashberg function and the coulomb pseudopotential ( @xmath0 ) , where @xmath0 models the coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "we notice that its value is selected in such way that @xmath14 determined on the basis of the eliashberg equations equals the experimental value of the critical temperature .    in the presented paper",
    ", we have analysed the thermodynamic properties of calcium under the pressure at @xmath25 gpa by using the eliashberg approach .",
    "in particular , the following parameters were taken into account : the specific heat in the superconducting state ( @xmath26 ) , the specific heat in the normal state ( @xmath27 ) , and the thermodynamic critical field ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "additionally , the dimensionless ratios @xmath29 and @xmath4 have been determined @xcite .    for calcium",
    ", the dependence of the critical temperature on the pressure has been obtained experimentally by okada _",
    "et al . _ in 1996 @xcite and then by yabuuchi _",
    "_ in 2006 @xcite .",
    "the results prove that the critical temperature grows with the pressure from the value of about @xmath30 k ( @xmath31 gpa ) to @xmath19 k ( @xmath32 gpa ) . on the basis of",
    "the yabuuchi s results it is easy to show that the values of the coulomb pseudopotential can be large .",
    "for example , @xmath33_{{\\rm p=120gpa}}=0.215 $ ] and @xmath33_{{\\rm p=160gpa}}=0.241 $ ] @xcite , @xcite . in the case of the pressure @xmath25 gpa ,",
    "the experimental value of @xmath14 is still unknown , therefore the wide range of the coulomb pseudopotential s values have been considered in the paper ; @xmath34 .",
    "the eliashberg functions for calcium were determined by yin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . at the pressure @xmath25 gpa , the @xmath35 structure",
    "is clearly favored , and the linear - response calculations indicate that it is also dynamically stable . additionally , the yin s results have shown that the strong electron - phonon coupling persists and @xmath14 can be high ( @xmath36 k ) . in the paper , the thermodynamic parameters for calcium have been calculated by using the eliashberg equations on the imaginary axis , the yin s eliashberg function has been taken into account .",
    "the eliashberg set has the following form :    @xmath37    and @xmath38                                    \\frac{\\phi_{m } }                                    { \\sqrt{\\omega_m^2z^{2}_{m}+\\phi^{2}_{m}}}.\\ ] ]    the wave function renormalization factor is denoted by @xmath39 , and the order parameter function by @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41-th matsubara frequency has the form : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we notice that the value of the order parameter is given by the ratio : @xmath45 . in eqs . and",

    "the exact solution of the eliashberg equations represents a complicated problem .",
    "we notice that formally the eliashberg set contains the infinite number of the non - linear algebraic equations ; in addition every equation has the integral kernel , which is dependent on the form of the eliashberg function .",
    "it is possible to prove , that if we limit the number of the matsubara frequencies , the solutions of the eliashberg equations lose the convergence only in the area of the very low temperatures . in the paper",
    "we assume @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are stable for @xmath56 k. the eliashberg equations have been solved by using iterative method @xcite .",

    "we have considered the selected values of the coulomb pseudopotential and temperatures .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath58 decreases with @xmath57 number s growth . in particular",
    ", the strong fall of the order parameter appears for low values of @xmath57 ; for higher values the function @xmath58 saturates . very similar dependence on the number @xmath57 possesses the wave function renormalization factor",
    "( see fig . ) . however , the function @xmath59 saturates considerably slower than @xmath58 .",
    "the growth of the coulomb pseudopotential s value differently influences on the order parameter and the wave function renormalization factor . in the first case",
    "the values of the order parameter strongly decrease ; whereas the function @xmath59 is practically not changing . from the physical point of view",
    "the above facts mean , that together with the increasing of @xmath0 decreases only the value of the critical temperature ; the electron effective mass remains fixed ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the solutions of the eliashberg equations also very unlikely evolve with the temperature .",
    "most clearly this fact is possible to observe in fig . , where the dependences of @xmath61 and @xmath62 on the temperature have been plotted .",
    "in particular , the obtained results show that the temperature dependence of the order parameter can be modeled by the function : @xmath63 , where the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath14 , and @xmath65 are collected in tab . .",
