    "most of the rapidly accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are observed to rotate in a strikingly narrow range of frequencies  from @xmath6hz to @xmath7hz ( see e.g. van der klis 1997 ) . a natural explanation for this could be some mechanism which prevents further neutron - star spin - up once the rotational frequency is sufficiently high .",
    "recently several such mechanisms were proposed :    white and zhang ( 1997 ) suggested that magnetic braking could be responsible for halting the spin - up ; this idea will not be discussed here .",
    "bildsten ( 1998 ) pointed out that , because gravitational radiation reaction is a sharply increasing function of rotational frequency , it might halt the spin - ip . in his original manuscript ,",
    "bildsten identified one mechanism for triggering the necessary gravitational waves : lateral density variations caused by temperature dependence of electron capture reactions . while his manuscript was being refereed , bildsten learned of the discovery that an r - mode instability , driven by gravitational radiation , can be very strong in spinning neutron stars ( andersson 1998 , friedman and morsink 1998 , lindblom , owen and morsink 1998 , andersson , kokkotas and schutz 1998 , owen et al 1998 ) ; and the r - mode experts learned of bildsten s gravitational - wave idea for saturating lmxb spinup .",
    "both groups independently saw the connection : bildsten ( 1998 ) and andersson , kokkotas and stergioulas ( 1998 ) proposed that the r - mode instability could provide enough gravitational - radiation reaction to halt the lmxb spinup . in this letter",
    "we examine the consequences of this proposal .",
    "our conclusions depend crucially on whether the dissipation of the r - modes decreases with temperature ( as is the case , e.g. , when shear viscosity dominates the r - mode damping ) , or instead is temperature - independent ( as is the case when , e.g. , the mutual friction of proton and neutron superfluids dominates the damping ) . in the former case ( section @xmath8 of this paper )",
    "we find that the neutron star will undergo a spin - up  heating  spin - down  cooling cycle ; in the latter case ( section @xmath9 ) it will probably settle down to a stable equilibrium state with an internal neutron - star temperature of about @xmath10k .",
    "let us consider first the case when dissipation is a decreasing function of temperature . we show that , if some r - modes become unstable in a neutron star spun up by accretion , then they heat up the neutron star through shear viscousity .",
    "as the neutron star heats up , the r - modes become more unstable .",
    "a thermo - gravitational runaway takes place , in which the r - mode amplitude grows , as a result of this growth the star s temperature rises , the dissipation becomes weaker and the instability becomes stronger . within a fraction of a year",
    "the r - modes gravitational radiation reaction spins the star down to a rotation frequency which is close to the minimum of the critical stability curve ( probably around @xmath11hz , but the exact value depends on poorly understood dissipation mechanisms  see below ) , with a final temperature of about @xmath12k .",
    "the instability then shuts off and the star begins a several - million - year epoch of neutrino cooling and accretional spinup , leading back to the original instability point .",
    "1 shows a typical evolutionary trajectory @xmath13 of the neutron star in the @xmath14 plane , where @xmath15 is the temperature of the star s core measured in units of @xmath16k , and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the angular velocity of the neutron star and @xmath19 is it s mean density .",
    "the portion @xmath20 of the curve represents the accretional spin - up of the neutron star to the critical angular frequency @xmath21 ; @xmath22 represents the heating stage in which the r - modes become unstable , grow and heat up the neutron star ; @xmath23 shows the spindown stage in which the r - mode amplitude saturates because of poorly understood nonlinear effects , and the angular velocity decreases due to the emission of gravitational radiation ; and @xmath24 represents cooling back to the equilibrium temperature with simultaneous spin - up by accretion .",
    "all four stages are discussed in more detail below .",
    "the initial ( steady - state ) temperature @xmath25 of the neutron - star core in steadily accreting lmxb s is somewhat uncertain ; according to brown and bildsten ( 1998 ) , who analyzed heat transport during steady thermonuclear burning of the accreted material and nuclear reactions in the deep ocean , @xmath26k . in fig .",
    "1 we assume @xmath27k .",
    "the curve @xmath28 is the so - called r - mode `` stability curve '' ( lindblom , owen and morsink 1998 ) .",
    "if the neutron star is represented by a point above the curve , then some r - modes in the star are unstable and grow . otherwise , all r - modes decay .",
    "the portion @xmath29 of the stability curve is determined by the shear viscosity , or by mutual friction if part of the star is superfluid .",
    "its exact location is uncertain precisely because the dissipation of the r - modes at the relevant temperatures is poorly understood .",
    "if shear viscosity dominates the dissipation , then the equation of the @xmath29 portion of the stability curve is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the shear viscosity of the neutron star material , and @xmath32 is the shear viscosity due to electron - electron scattering in the neutron star [ we have used eqs  ( 2.10 ) , ( 2.14 ) , ( 2.15 ) and table i of owen et .",
    "al . ( 1998 ) to work out eq . ( [ stabil ] ) ] .",
    "if only shear viscosity due to to electron - electron scattering were operating , with the shear viscosity given by @xmath33 , where all quantities are in cgs units ( see cutler and lindblom 1987 and references therein ) , then the critical rotational frequency at @xmath34k would be @xmath35hz , which is much less than observed values ( van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "however , the friction is probably larger than this ( and therefore @xmath36 is also larger ) because of interaction of the core fluid with the crust and maybe mutual friction in a superfluid state .",
    "the emphasis of this paper is not to figure out whether the r - mode instability is relevant for lmxbs , but to investigate the consequences if it is relevant .",
    "for purpose of illustration , we assume that @xmath37 ; this makes the critical rotational frequency @xmath7hz at @xmath34k , which is consistent with observations ( van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "this choice of viscosity is a cheat since we do nt yet know the @xmath38 and @xmath39-dependence of @xmath31 . however , unless the damping is due to mutual friction , @xmath31 is likely to decrease with increasing temperature , which is a sufficient condition for thermo - gravitational runaway .",
    "our choice of viscosity possesses this feature ; therefore we believe it has a good chance of representing the real physics .",
    "the portion @xmath40 of the stability curve is determined by bulk - viscosity dissipation ; it s exact location is also a subject of yet unsettled controversy [ the heart of the problem is the calculation of lagrangian perturbation in density ( lindblom , owen and morsink 1998 , andersson , kokkotas and schutz 1998 ) , which , to our best knowledge , has not been reliably carried out by any of the groups ] .",
    "of the two current estimates of the bulk - viscosity contribution to damping of the r - modes , we have chosen the one which gives the higher values of @xmath41 , thus maximizing its effect ( see lindblom , owen and morsink 1998 ) .",
    "the fact that , for the evolution curve shown in figure  1 no part is in the region where the bulk viscosity dominates suggests that the details of the bulk viscosity will not be of particular importance .",
    "in this work for concreteness we specialize to a polytropic model of a neutron star with @xmath42 , and consider the r - mode with @xmath43 , which is expected to have the strongest instability in such polytropes ( friedman and morsink 1998 , lindblom , owen and morsink 1998 ) .",
    "we assume that the time evolution of the normalized angular velocity @xmath17 of the star and the dimensionless amplitude @xmath44 of the r - mode are given by phenomenological equations ( 3.14 ) , ( 3.15 ) , ( 3.16 ) and ( 3.17 ) of owen et al ( 1998 ) : @xmath45 @xmath46 when @xmath47 ( the saturation value of @xmath48 , which we assume to be @xmath49 ) , and by @xmath50    @xmath51    when @xmath44 is saturated due to not yet understood non - linear effects . here",
    "@xmath44 is the dimensionless amplitude of the r - mode defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) of lindblom , owen and morsink ( 1998 ) , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the viscous and gravitational timescales for the r - mode dissipation and are given by eqs ( 2.14 ) and ( 2.15 ) of owen et al ( 1998 ) : @xmath54 in the above equation the viscous damping rate is a sum of contributions from the shear and the bulk viscosities ; the former is determined by @xmath55 which we took to be @xmath56sec in order to fit the observed data ; the latter is determined by @xmath57 which is taken to be @xmath58sec , in agreement with owen et .",

    "( [ eq : omega ] ) represents the neutron - star spin - up by accretion ; @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the mass of the neutron star and its accretion rate respectively , and @xmath61 is a factor of order unity which depends on the accretion radius and the angular velocity of the neutron star ; it s exact value is not essential for the physics discussed here and we set @xmath62 from here onwards .",
    "the numerical parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 are given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively for a polytrope star of adiabatic index @xmath67 ( lindblom , owen and morsink 1998 ) .",
    "for the evolution shown in fig .",
    "1 we took @xmath68 and @xmath69yr , and we assumed a random initial perturbation of magnitude @xmath70 when the neutron star reaches the stability curve @xmath29 .",
    "now consider the star s thermal evolution .",
    "the r - mode deposits heat into the star at the rate @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the energy in the r - mode [ cf .",
    "( 3.11 ) of owen et al ( 1998 ) ] . here",
    "@xmath73 is the radius of the neutron star taken to be @xmath74 km , and @xmath75 for the polytropic model considered here . at the relevant temperatures the neutron star is expected to cool predominantly by the modified urca process",
    "( this is not entirely true , since close to @xmath16k neutrino bremstruhlung cooling from the crust and radiative cooling by photons might become significant .",
    "however , their cooling rates are not significantly larger than that of the modified urca process at @xmath16k , and they become negligible at higher temperatures . in this work for simplicity",
    "we assume that modified urca is the only cooling process ; the inclusion of other processes would not change the general evolutionary picture ) .",
    "the modified urca cooling rate , reduced by heating from nuclear reactions in the deep crust , is given by ( shapiro and teukolsky , 1983 ) @xmath76 here the subscript @xmath77 indicates that the temperature is measured in units of @xmath16k and @xmath78 is the equilibrium temperature of the neutron star before the r - mode heating starts , taken to be @xmath16k for our calculation .",
    "the thermal evolution equation is then given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the heat capacity of the neutron star , taken to be @xmath81(erg / k)@xmath82 [ from shapiro and teukolsky ( 1983 ) , eq .",
    "( 11.8.2 ) . however , the heat capacity of neutron star with a superfluid core is less ] .    equations ( [ eq : omega ] ) , ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , ( [ eq : omega1 ] ) , ( [ eq : alpha1 ] ) and ( [ eq : temperature ] ) determine the time evolution of the angular velocity @xmath18 and temperature @xmath38 .",
    "figure  1 shows the predicted evolution , for the representative parameter values , introduced above .",
    "the evolution consists of four stages :    the first stage @xmath20 is the spin - up of the neutron star , during which it s angular velocity @xmath18 is increasing towards the critical one , and the r - mode instability is suppressed by viscosity ; since we assume that the star begins at its equilibrium temperature @xmath83 , its temperature changes little during the spin - up .",
    "for an assumed accretion rate of @xmath84yr this stage takes @xmath4 years .",
    "when the angular velocity reaches its critical value , the r - mode starts to grow and the second stage @xmath22 begins .",
    "the neutron star gets heated up by the r - mode through viscosity , the r - mode becomes more unstable , and thermo - gravitational runaway follows .",
    "it takes @xmath0 years for the r - mode s amplitude to evolve from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the value of the r - mode amplitude at which the accretional torque is exactly compensated by the gravitational radiation reaction [ see wagoner ( 1984 ) ] . for our intuition it is useful to define two characteristic @xmath44-dependent timescales for stage @xmath22 : the thermal timescale [ cf eq .",
    "( [ wdiss ] ) ] @xmath88 and the timescale for the decrease of angular velocity [ cf eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) ] @xmath89 clearly , the neutron star heats up much faster than it spins down due to gravitational radiation .",
    "therefore , during this stage the angular velocity of the star decreases by only a small amount , @xmath90 .",
    "physically , the reasons for such little change in @xmath91 are that the r - mode amplitude grows so quickly , and that in this phase the angular momentum loss is not manifested in a reduction of the angular velocity , but instead in the growth of the r - mode itself ( the r - mode which is driven by gravitational radiation reaction carries a negative angular momentum )",
    ".    eventually the r - mode amplitude saturates due to nonlinear effects .",
    "this initiates the third stage of the evolution , in which all of the angular momentum loss is manifested by reduction of angular velocity ( since the r - mode can not grow any more ) , and the star spins down @xmath23 to the critical angular velocity . at point",
    "@xmath92 the temperature of the neutron star is such that the neutrino cooling exactly compensates the dissipative heating from the r - modes . after that the temperature does not change much until the spin - down stage is terminated .",
    "the physical reason for this is that even though the thermal timescale at @xmath93 is comparable or smaller than the spindown timescale , the rate of dissipative heating does not change much . if the heat capacity @xmath80 of neutron star were zero , we would have @xmath94 at all points of @xmath93 .",
    "this would imply @xmath95 , so even then the temperature would not change significantly over this last part of the spin - down .",
    "an analytical expression for the duration of this rapid spin - down stage can be derived from eqs  ( [ eq : omega1 ] )  and  ( [ eq : timescales ] ) : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the angular velocity at the end of the spin - down . in our simulations",
    "@xmath98 is about @xmath99 years .",
    "after the neutron star reaches the stability curve , the r - mode is damped by viscosity stronger than it is driven by gravitational - radiation reaction ; therefore its amplitude decreases and the neutron star cools back to its original equilibrium temperature , while being spun up by accretion .",
    "this part of the evolution is represented by @xmath24 on fig .  1 ; its timescale is the same as that for the original accretional spin - up , i.e. @xmath4 years .",
    "after this the cycle is closed and can repeat itself as long as the accretion continues .",
    "we believe that the sharp kink at point @xmath100 is not a real physical effect , but a result of our poor understanding of the non - linear saturation of the r - mode ; however , this artificial feature of our simulations does not seem to affect the existence of the thermo - gravitational runaway and the subsequent rapid spin - down to a lower angular velocity .",
    "despite a large number of uncertainties in the details of the evolution , we believe that this scenario is robust so long as the r - mode instability does occur in lmxbs , and the damping of the r - modes decreases with temperature .",
    "if the above described evolutionary scenario is generic , it is then clear that none of the currently observed lmxbs can possess an actively operating r - mode instability  otherwise we would observe a rapid spindown on a time - scale less than a year .",
    "however , it is conceivable that many of the neutron stars in these lmxbs have undergone the r - mode instability at some stage of their evolution , and are currently below the stability curve , evolving along leg @xmath24 of fig .  1 .",
    "from equations ( [ down ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) we can estimate the fraction @xmath101 of neutron stars in extragalactic lmxbs that are in the phase of active emission of gravitational waves : @xmath102 the quantity @xmath103 is bounded from below by the rotational frequencies of young pulsars ( this statement is true only if the r - mode damping is the same for young and old pulsars at the same temperatures ) .",
    "the rotational frequency of the recently discovered n157b ( marshall et al 1998 ) is @xmath104hz .",
    "using the braking index theory one can project the initial rotational frequency of this pulsar to be no smaller then @xmath105hz , which implies @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , only @xmath107 of neutron stars in extragalactic lmxbs are in the phase of rapid gravitational wave emission , which implies that to catch one star in this phase , gravitational - wave detectors must reach out through a volume large enough to encompass @xmath108 galaxies like our own ( this assumes that there are @xmath109 strongly accreting neutron stars in lmxbs in our galaxy ) .",
    "an analysis similar to that of owen et al ( 1998 ) shows that even `` advanced ligo '' detectors are unlikely to be able to see these sources at such great distances .",
    "there is a possible alternative evolutionary scenario which is similar to the one proposed by bildsten ( 1998 ) and andersson , kokkotas and stergioulas ( 1998 ) ( we thank lee lindblom for pointing this out ) .",
    "it may be that the r - mode damping is dominated not by normal dissipative processes , but by mutual friction in the neutron - proton superfluid .",
    "detailed calculations of the effect of such friction on the r - mode damping are in progress ( lindblom and mendell ) ; however for our analysis the essential feature of this dissipative process is already known : it is temperature independent .",
    "therefore , if this process dominates , one would not expect a thermo - gravitational runaway ; instead the neutron star will reach a state of three - fold equilibrium . the neutron star will  sit \" on the stability curve [ @xmath110 ,",
    "the amplitude of the r - mode will adjust so that the accretional torque is compensated by the gravitational - radiation reaction torque ( @xmath111 for our model ) , and the temperature of the neutron star will adjust so that the cooling compensates the frictional heating from the r - mode : @xmath94 . from eqs  ( [ eq : omega ] ) , ( [ eq : timescales ] ) , ( [ wdiss ] ) and ( [ lcool ] ) one can work out the equilibrium temperature : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the rotational frequency of the star .",
    "it is interesting to examine how ( and whether ) the star reaches this equilibrium point . for temperature - independent",
    "damping , eqs  ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha ] ) form a closed system with two independent variables , @xmath91 and @xmath44 . to investigate the behavior of the star",
    "after it reaches the stability curve at @xmath114 , we set @xmath115 and expand eqs  ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha ] ) to first order in @xmath116 . after trivial algebraic manipulations",
    ", we can then reduce the system of two first - order differential equations to a single second - order differential equation : @xmath117 here @xmath118 , and @xmath119 and @xmath120 are given by @xmath121 and @xmath122 in the above equations @xmath53 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : timescales ] ) , and @xmath123 is the timescale for the neutron star to be spun up by accretion to the angular frequency @xmath36 .    clearly eq .",
    "( [ particle ] ) can be thought of as an equation of motion for a particle of unit mass in the potential well given by @xmath120 and with the damping @xmath124 .",
    "the bottom of the potential well corresponds to the equilibrium state described above , and the damping insures that the `` particle '' gets there ( i.e. that the neutron star settles into the equilibrium state ) .",
    "however , the damping is small . to see this ,",
    "consider damped oscillatory motion close to the bottom of the well .",
    "the complex angular frequency of this motion is given by @xmath125 the period of these small oscillations is @xmath126 but the timescale on which they are damped ( i.e. the timescale on which the equilibrium is reached ) is @xmath127y .",
    "since the damping is so small , fluctuating disturbances may keep this nonlinear oscillator off it s equilibrium position .",
    "for example , in our evolutionary scenario we have assumed that there is a mechanism which gives @xmath44 some non - zero initial value .",
    "presumably , the same mechanism could keep the oscillator in an excited state .",
    "then the amplitude of the r - mode , and hence the temperature of the star s core , would vary on the timescales of hundreds of years .",
    "detailed investigation of these issues is a subject for further work .",
    "however it is clear that the time - averaged temperature should be close to the equilibrium value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) .",
    "if the r - mode damping does not depend on temperature , we can expect r - modes to be excited in many of the rapidly rotating neutron stars in lmxbs .",
    "these presumably superfluid steady gravitational - wave emitters could be detected by enhanced ligo gravitational wave detectors , as discussed in bildsten ( 1998 ) and andersson , kokkotas and stergioulas ( 1998 ) .",
    "recently , brady and creighton ( 1998 ) have considered the computational cost of such detection .",
    "their conclusion was that with the enhanced ligo sensitivity and available computational capabilities one could detect gravitational - wave emitters in lmxbs that are as bright in x - ray flux as sco - x1 .",
    "if the rotational frequency of the emitting neutron star is localized to within a few @xmath128s of hz using astronomical observations ( by , e.g. , qpo s ) , one could narrow - band the interferometer response around the frequency of r - mode oscillations ( see e.g. meers 1988 ) .",
    "this could allow ligo to detect gravitational - wave emitters in lmxbs which are @xmath109 times dimmer in x - ray flux than sco - x1 .",
    "positive detection of gravitational waves at the r - mode oscillation frequency would make a strong case for the superfluid nature of the r - mode damping .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the recent proposal that the accretional spin - up of the neutron star in an lmxb is stopped by r - mode gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "there are two possible evolutionary scenarios . in the first scenario ,",
    "the neutron star goes through cycles such as that shown on fig .  1 .",
    "the necessary condition for this scenario to be relevant is that r - mode damping should decrease with increasing temperature . in this case",
    ", it is very unlikely that any of the currently observed neutron stars in lmxbs in our galaxy are in the r - mode excited phase of the cycle .",
    "the detection of gravitational radiation from extragalactic lmxbs in the r - mode excited phase is also not likely , even with advanced ligo interferometers .    in the second scenario , r",
    "- mode damping is temperature independent , and a steady - state equilibrium is probably reached , where both angular velocity and temperature stay constant , or are oscillating with periods of several hundreds of years .",
    "equation ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) makes a robust prediction for the temperature of these objects to be @xmath129k ; this temperature is on the high end of what is typically expected ; and it might be possible to test this prediction by observations . in this case",
    "the neutron stars are emitters of periodic gravitational waves , which could be detected by interferometers like enhanced ligo .",
