    "the web of cosmological large scale structure is both strikingly evident in observations and simulations and difficult to characterize .",

    "recent overviews of many of these directions can be found in the proceedings of the @xcite .",
    "these cosmological structures evolved via gravitational instability from initial conditions which have been characterized by measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these early time initial conditions are well described by gaussian random fields , which can also be classified into cosmic web structures . an assortment of different approximate methods can be used to estimate properties of the late time counterparts of the structures found in the initial conditions .",
    "properties include the fraction of mass which will collapse into a certain type of cosmological structure , the number of such structures , etc .",
    "classic works include @xcite ; some textbook descriptions are found in @xcite and @xcite . for instance , peaks in the initial conditions can be associated with collapsed halos at late times on average @xcite , and properties of the peaks can be connected to final time properties of the halos ( for instance by tracing back particles in simulations to their early time configurations such as in , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "halos are the most studied cosmological structures , in part due to their close identification to galaxies @xcite .",
    "this note extends studies of cosmic structures within the specific cosmic web classification considered in @xcite .",
    "( their detailed particular definitions are in  [ sec : background ] below . ) in that work , they compared analytic predictions for initial random gaussian fields ( equivalently , their values linearly extrapolated to final time ) and measurements of fully evolved dark matter simulations at late times ( redshift @xmath1 ) .",
    "for some values of their parameters , including the primary one which we focus upon in this work , the volume fractions of the structures for gaussian random fields and structures for fully evolved dark matter simulations counterparts at late times were comparable .",
    "the analytic mass fractions followed the same trends as found in the final time simulations , but were somewhat too high for sheets and too low for filaments .",
    "( halos , which have the largest overdensities and thus might be expected to have the largest differences in the two methods , contribute a very small fraction to both the mass and volume fractions in this structure classification . )",
    "this analytic classification of cosmological gaussian initial conditions has further consequences , as the power spectrum also determines mean spatial properties around a given central point .",
    "we analyze these spatial properties in this note .",
    "we find mean properties of regions around different choices of origin , classified as halos , filaments , or sheets , regions we call mean halos , mean filaments and mean sheets .",
    "( the boundary around a `` mean void '' is more challenging to define as for many parameter choices the mean background is also a void , so that a boundary is not evident ) .",
    "the central shear values of these mean objects are an additional parameter which must be chosen .",
    "we explore three natural choices for these mean object central shear values , and measure sizes , shapes , shear profiles , and mean linearly extrapolated overdensities of the resulting mean halos , filaments and sheets .",
    "we also discuss scatter around these mean configurations , subtleties in their construction , and some possible relations between mean halos and final time collapsed halos .",

    "we also discuss scatter around the mean . in ",
    "[ sec : collapse ] we turn to possible connections of the mean halos to collapsed halos at late times . in  [ sec : conclude ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "the three appendices give details of the calculations ( shear , zeldovich displacement and scatter ) , subtleties which arise in some interpretations of one of our construction methods and properties of mean maps corresponding to slightly different constraints at the origin used by @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum used is for a @xmath2cdm universe with @xmath3 @xcite , calculated with the @xcite transfer function .",
    "the cosmic web can be separated into halos ( sometimes called nodes ) , filaments , sheets and voids .",
    "we will use the term halo and node interchangeably , as both terms are commonly used for these structures .",
    "there are many different web classifications based upon density , morphology , shear and beyond , some of which concentrate on just finding one particular type of structure ( e.g. halos or voids ) and others which classify an entire map .",
    "we use a classification of the latter sort , assigning a type of cosmic structure to every region based upon its shear .",
    "we begin with details of our shear definition and classification .",
    "we follow @xcite for definitions and for much of the analysis methodology below .",
    "the shear is defined on the initial gaussian perturbations as @xmath4 our potential @xmath5 has the same spatial dependence as the newtonian potential @xmath6 at early times but is time independent : @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is newton s constant , @xmath9 is the mean background density of the universe , and @xmath10 is the linear growth factor describing how linear structure grows as the universe expands with scale factor @xmath11 .",
    "the derivatives @xmath12 are with respect to the comoving coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "the potential @xmath14 is related to the initial density perturbations evolved linearly to the present time , @xmath15 , via the poisson equation : @xmath16 at times earlier than the present time the linearly evolved overdensity obeys @xmath17 the linearly evolved overdensity at the present time , @xmath18 at position @xmath13 is defined in terms of ( the linearly evolved to the present time ) density via @xmath19 .",
    "the factor @xmath20 is the square root of the integral of the power spectrum @xmath21 associated with @xmath15 , smoothed on scale @xmath22 @xmath23 i.e. , the root mean square fluctuations of the density contrast @xmath15 .",
    "we use a gaussian window function , @xmath24 in part to connect more closely with @xcite , as we use their parameters as a starting point below .",
    "one of the parameters of the classification is the smoothing scale @xmath22 .",
    "we will show results from @xmath25 , studied in depth by @xcite , but note trends we saw for other cases we explored , @xmath26 .",
    "again , to make the notation clear , because @xmath27 , @xmath15 equals the linearly evolved density perturbation today and @xmath20 corresponds to its commonly used definition as the square root of the integral of the power spectrum linearly evolved to the present day .",
    "some other approaches include @xmath10 in the overdensity , and thus in @xmath28 .",
    "as the fluctuations @xmath20 are associated with the overdensity , in our definition they have a factor of @xmath10 as well , and so @xmath29 remains time independent .",
    "this is one reason for introducing @xmath20 into our definition of shear .",
    "other definitions of shear also sometimes take out the trace , again not the case here .",
    "when the shear in numerical simulations is considered , eq .  [ eq : sheardef ] is often used as well , but with the the fully evolved nonlinear potential ( determined by the evolved densities in the simulation ) , rather than its linearly evolved counterpart used in the analytic work in this note .",
    "the potential @xmath28 can also be used to find the zeldovich approximation to the displacement of initial positions at a later time . in the lagrangian approach to structure formation",
    ", the final position @xmath30 of an initial mass component with initial position @xmath31 is related via the displacement @xmath32 : @xmath33 in the zeldovich approximation , @xmath34 for the initial configuration , with coordinate @xmath31 , multiplying the linear final time density by @xmath10 and taking @xmath11 small gives the initial density ( which is linear because it is small , @xmath35 as @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the shear can thus be thought of either as a property of the linearly evolved final density perturbations , or as a property of positions at early times ( which then change , using eq .",
    "[ eq : zeldef ] )",
    ". we will discuss properties in both interpretations .",
    "the @xmath38 shear matrix @xmath29 has three eigenvalues , traditionally ordered as @xmath39 .",
    "their sum , the trace of the shear , is proportional to the density by eq .",
    "[ eq : delphi ] , @xmath40    halos , filaments , sheets and voids can then be defined as regions where ( 3,2,1,0 ) respectively of the @xmath41 are above some threshold @xmath42 . in one way of estimating later structure formation , an initial region",
    "is expected to collapse at late times if it linearly evolves to cross some overdensity threshold @xmath43 . as the linearly evolved overdensity @xmath44 , and regions classified here as halos",
    "might be expected to collapse at late times ( this is an assumption ) , this relation suggests some minimum @xmath41 , i.e. nonzero @xmath0 , for initial conditions .",
    "note that this condition also means that the mean background , @xmath45 , is also classified as a void .",
    "there are thus two scales in this classification , the smoothing @xmath22 and the threshold @xmath0 .",
    "many different choices have been used in the literature .",
    "the same eigenvalue classification is sometimes used for dark matter simulations , but ( as mentioned above ) using the shear associated with the fully evolved nonlinear potential , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "for example , in dark matter nonlinear simulations evolved to redshift zero , @xcite found @xmath46 and @xmath47 separates structure into these different classes in a way that matches visual estimates , while @xcite considered @xmath48 and @xmath49 and found improvements for @xmath50 based upon volume fractions and mass fractions .",
    "one comparison between the above analytic and simulation approaches is by @xcite . in both approaches",
    ", they measured the mass fraction and volume fraction in the four cosmic structures as a function of @xmath0 , and for two values of @xmath22 .",
    "they found reasonable correspondence of volume and mass fractions for filaments , sheets and voids between the analytically calculated linearly evolved perturbations and the numerically evolved fully nonlinear simulations .",
    "given this , we looked for further characteristic properties of the cosmic web in the analytic construction and report these properties here .",
    "we focus for the most part on the parameters used in @xcite . by eq .",
    "[ eq : delphi ] , where each type of structure corresponds to @xmath15 crossing some particular threshold @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the distributions of halos using @xmath0 vs @xmath51 was done in @xcite where it was found that the @xmath0 constraint worked well . in analytic work inspiring the work here , @xcite considered a mixed constraint , using both @xmath0 and @xmath51 to define halos and voids , and compared density anisotropies at large distances between the analytic ( linearly evolved to final time ) and simulated ( nonlinearly evolved to final time ) calculations .",
    "the mixed constraint makes the identification of filaments and sheets less direct .",
    "we give properties using the @xcite constraint in appendix ",
    "[ sec : papsheex ] .",
    "structures classified using eigenvalues of the hessian of the density ( e.g. @xcite ) and the hessian of the velocities ( e.g. @xcite ) have also been considered in great detail by many authors . ]",
    "we will use these definitions of halos , filaments , sheets and voids to analytically calculate mean configurations of each , for initial random gaussian field configurations with different choices of @xmath22 and @xmath0 .",
    "unlike press - schechter theory where one changes the smoothing scale to consider different mass halos , here the one smoothing scale produces a separation of a full configuration into halos , filaments , sheets and voids , i.e. one smoothing scale completely classifies an entire map .",
    "our mean objects correspond to one such specific smoothing scale and threshold .",
    "the analytic definition of halos , filaments , sheets and voids in terms of @xmath0 allows the calculation of volume and mass fractions in each type of object and the average value of each of the eigenvalues @xmath52 in the gaussian random field initial conditions .",
    "the probability distribution for the ordered eigenvalues @xmath53 of a gaussian random field is @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "the mean eigenvalues for this particular constraint @xmath57 , which we will denote by @xmath59 , are @xmath60 in this example , for each structure the corresponding normalization @xmath61 , eq .

    "it depends both upon @xmath0 and the type of structure ( halo , filament , sheet or void ) . in practice ,",
    "for any given @xmath0 we integrated these expressions numerically using mathematica .",
    "another constraint goes beyond restricting eigenvalues in terms @xmath0 for each structure , requiring the @xmath28 from which they come to also correspond to extremal values of the potential ( @xmath64 ) . in this case",
    "the shear obeys conditions to be a halo , filament , sheet or void in terms of @xmath0 , and its potential also obeys @xmath65 .",
    "the measure for the volume average of points obeying this constraint is found in @xcite , starting with the probability distribution for the random gaussian fields @xmath66 times the constraint on @xmath67 .",
    "they were interested in peaks and minima in particular , as their main interest was for halos and voids ( they also had a restriction on @xmath28 , which we do not impose here , and thus it drops out of the expressions ) .",
    "their initial measure for integrating the probability density over volume , shear and @xmath67 becomes an integral over the eigenvalues similar to that in eq .",

    "we will consider one other shear average below , that of the mean objects we construct .",
    "the eigenvalues of the average shear within these mean objects will be called @xmath74 .",
    "one can go beyond the analytic volume fractions , mass fractions and the constrained shear eigenvalue averages for each structure type by using the power spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum can be used to calculate mean spatial properties of the shear around any given central shear configuration .",
    "we make maps of these mean shear values around a given central shear value , and study properties of regions within them , in particular those regions sharing the same cosmic web classification as the central point .",
    "we use the method of @xcite , following @xcite , to find the mean values of @xmath75 ( and thus @xmath76 ) everywhere around a given configuration @xmath77 at the origin .",
    "their calculation , for our case of interest , is summarized in appendix  [ sec : shearcalc ] . denoting the constraint at the origin as @xmath78",

    "we consider the central objects in the mean maps in the most detail .",
    "the central object in a mean map is the region sharing the same cosmic web classification ( e.g. filament ) as the origin and which are continuously connected to the origin via regions with this same classification . far away from the origin , the correlations and thus the mean shear go to zero and the mean configuration becomes the mean background ( again , this is a void region for @xmath50 ) . in between the origin and mean background , depending upon parameters , several different types of structures may occur .",
    "for instance mean halos tend to have filaments and then sheets around them before reaching the mean background .",

    "this comparison is nontrivial .",
    "although the division of halo , filament , sheet and void regions is direct in simulations , as are their volume and mass fractions , the separation into specific distinct objects , e.g. different filaments , is not immediate . splitting halo , filament , sheet and void regions into objects",
    "so that their stack gives our mean objects might be a natural way of defining such individual objects in the full map , but presumably additional assumptions will be required .",
    "the stacking might be most naturally associated with doing a volume average over extremal points as in our choice 3 of origin shear .",
    "this work is in a different direction than the extremely interesting research on finding the probability distribution of initial conditions which are consistent with a given final measured nonlinear configuration ( e.g. the line of study pursued in @xcite ) although both kinds of studies involve cosmic web classifications of initial conditions and their inferred counterparts at late times .    several free parameters appeared in the construction , including the threshold @xmath0 , the smoothing @xmath22 and the central values @xmath98 .",

    "one complication was already noted for voids , as constructing a mean void volume is challenging when there is no boundary between a mean `` void '' configuration and the mean background , i.e. no mean void `` size '' . in practice , restricting to halos , filaments and sheets , we took objects centered on each kind of structure and calculated the average shear within these objects for a given @xmath0 .",

    "for @xmath0 large enough , the mean halo structure only appears when it is the central object , so @xmath98 can be found for the mean halo by imposing @xmath194 for a mean halo centered at the origin .",
    "also , again for @xmath0 large enough , @xmath195 .",
    "then filaments only appear around the central mean halo and as the central mean filament .",
    "so we have : @xmath196 and the filamentary volume around the mean halo , @xmath197 is determined by the mean halo , already in hand . as we also know @xmath198 , we can constrain @xmath199    this can be used to see if the fraction of mean filament shear due to filaments around halos is large relative to that due to a filament centered at the origin . for @xmath97 halos and @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 , giving a fraction of filament volume due to filaments around halos of about 1/35 , which we thus neglected in calculating the filament central value shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aep ] . repeating the argument for sheets , for this threshold and smoothing , the relatively large sheet to filament volume fraction @xmath203 , combined with the large @xmath204 ,",
    "makes @xmath204 too large to reasonably neglect in this interpretation .",
    "( by trial and error ) to meet the constraint @xmath102 by considering the volume centered on the sheet alone . more generally , configurations where any @xmath205 were often quite hard to find via trial and error .",
    "this happens , for @xmath97 , at @xmath206 for filaments and @xmath207 for sheets .",
    "] in fig .",
    "[ fig : aep ] we thus considered instead @xmath208 to impose @xmath209 in a sheet configuration .",
    "( for the other scale studied in detail by @xcite , @xmath210 , filament contributions around halos and the filament to halo fraction ( 1/12 ) were both too large for their @xmath211 to permit neglect of @xmath191 . )",
    "one could include these subleading contributions directly instead of going to regimes where they can be neglected , as well , in some cases , when halos are not found in filament edges , and filaments are not found in sheet edges",
    ". it would be interesting to further explore this interpretation , although the issues with voids might make it difficult to push it very far .",
    "this mean halo / filament / sheet interpretation and argument also gives a characteristic mean halo , filament and sheet volume and an expression for @xmath212 in terms of the number of halos , the volume fractions of filaments and halos and the mean volumes of filaments and halos .",
    "for the simplest case , for instance , @xmath213 , and analogously for sheets .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this method for calculating mean shear was used by @xcite to find the mean shear due to a given configuration at the origin .",
    "they took the origin to correspond to 1 ) the sum of all halos with mass above some smoothing scale and 2 ) all voids associated with a smoothing scale , at large distances and final times . to find the central values of shear , they imposed conditions both on the eigenvalues of the shear individually and on their sum ( the density ) .",
    "we give here properties of the mean configuration maps for their boundary conditions at the origin .",
    "note that we consider the mean smoothed values given their boundary conditions ( that is we smooth the shear both at the origin and at the position it is being measured ) .",
    "they chose @xmath214 , where the latter was found by integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : dorav ] with either their halo or void constraints but with an additional constraint in the measure , a step function in the density . for halos , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , for voids , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "this is analogous to our choice of central shear 2 , except for the additional density constraint .",
    "in addition , voids and halos have different thresholds @xmath0 .    for the comparison with simulations , as @xmath22 increases",
    ", @xmath219 decreases and @xmath0 increases , so halos with a larger smoothing ( higher mass ) will also obey the constraints for a lower @xmath22 ( this was used in this note in  [ sec : collapse ] ) .",
    "thus for halos , @xcite interpret the resulting shear at the origin @xmath98 as due to the sum of halos with mass associated with @xmath22 and above .",
    "they take simulated halos with masses corresponding to @xmath22 and above in a numerical simulation , stack them , and compare measured and analytically predicted anisotropies in density at large distances , finding reasonable agreement .",
    "they consider masses @xmath220 , from which we find @xmath22 . in table 1 , we show halo and void configurations they used , with the corresponding @xmath221 , volume ( @xmath222 ) , shape , average @xmath223 ( eulerian ) overdensity , and @xmath98 , @xmath74 .",
    "we use a gaussian window function .",
    "interestingly , for these constraints , the central value of shear and the average value in the halo or void volume are very close .",
    "the density cut is a stringent constraint on the shear and the average density in the regions is close to the minimum ( maximum for voids ) imposed density .",
    "the associated volumes for the halos correspond to smaller masses than the lagrangian volumes of the halos associated with @xmath22 ."
