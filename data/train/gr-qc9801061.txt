    "phase transitions occuring in the early universe can give rise to topological defects of various kinds ; these may be domain walls , strings and monopoles as well as more exotic objects@xcite .",

    "there are several features of this asymptotic spacetime which are unusual :    at infinity , this spacetime is not flat .",
    "there is a solid angle deficit , @xmath14 , determined completely by the symmetry breaking scale , @xmath2 .",
    "the occurence of a deficit angle is a consequence of the non - trivial topology of the field configuration outside the monopole : non - vanishing gradients along non - radial directions give an energy density outside which falls off slowly , @xmath15 .",

    "this is not , however , a violation of the positive mass theorem  the spacetime is not asymptotically flat so that the gravitational mass does not coincide with the adm mass at infinity@xcite .",
    "a consequence of the slow falloff is that the total energy of the monopole diverges linearly . to regularize this energy we need to introduce a cutoff at some large radius , @xmath16 .",
    "this cutoff will be provided by the correlation length of the scalar field , @xmath17 . in cosmology , an upper bound on @xmath17",
    "is provided by the horizon size .",
    "when the solid angle deficit exceeds @xmath3 , ( @xmath18 ) , the roles of @xmath19 and @xmath20 get interchanged . the exterior solution which corresponds to barriola and vilenkin s ansatz is no longer static .",

    "however , the model suffers from the shortcoming that it only describes a static equilibrium and predicts such an equilibrium for all values of @xmath2 ; it does not possess the scope to describe non - static configurations .",
    "this is essentially because the energy density of false vacuum is constant . in general , when false vacuum is converted to true vacuum ( with constant solid angle deficit ) , the energy released is transferred to the core boundary @xcite .",
