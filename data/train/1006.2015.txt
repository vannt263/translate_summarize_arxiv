    "the mauritius radio telescope ( mrt )  @xcite is a fourier synthesis , t - shaped non - coplanar array operating at 151.5  mhz .",
    "the telescope was built to fill the gap in the availability of deep sky surveys at low radio frequencies in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the aim of the survey with mrt is to contribute to the database of southern sky sources in the declination ( @xmath3 ) range @xmath4 to @xmath5 , covering the entire right ascension ( @xmath6 ) , with a synthesised beam of @xmath7 and an expected point source sensitivity ( 1-@xmath0 ) of @xmath8  mjy  beam@xmath9 .",
    "the _ zenith angle _ @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 , where , @xmath12 @xmath13 is the latitude of mrt .",
    "mrt has been designed to be the southern - sky equivalent of the cambridge 6c survey at 151.5  mhz  @xcite .",
    "the next generation radio telescopes , like the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) , that are being built are low frequency arrays ; clearly indicating a renewed interest in metre - wavelength astronomy .",
    "the key astrophysical science drivers include acceleration , turbulence and propagation in the galactic interstellar medium , exploring the high redshift universe and transient phenomenon , as well as searching for the redshifted signature of neutral hydrogen from the cosmologically important epoch of reionisation ( eor ) .",
    "the surveys made using such arrays will provide critical information about foregrounds which will also provide a useful database for both extragalactic and galactic sources .",
    "mrt survey at 151.5  mhz is a step in that direction and , in addition , will provide the crucial sky model for calibration .",
    "imaging at mrt is presently done only on the meridian to minimise the problems of non - coplanarity . a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) image in @xmath6-@xmath14 coordinates is formed by stacking one - dimensional ( 1-d ) images on the meridian at different sidereal times .",
    "images of @xmath15 a steradian @xmath16 of the southern sky , with an rms noise in images of @xmath17  mjy  beam@xmath9 ( 1-@xmath0 ) , were produced by  @xcite .",
    "a suite of programs developed in - house was used to reduce @xmath18  hours of the survey data ( a quarter of the total @xmath19 hours observed over a span of @xmath20 years ) .",
    "the deconvolved images and a source catalogue of @xmath21 sources were published by  @xcite .",
    "systematics in positional errors were found when the positions of sources common to mrt catalogue and the molonglo reference catalogue ( mrc ) @xcite were compared .",
    "@xcite treated the systematics in errors in @xmath6 and @xmath14 independently . by estimating two separate 1-d least - squares fits for errors in @xmath6 and @xmath14 the systematics",
    "were corrected only in the source catalogue .",
    "however , errors remained in the images which impede usefulness of mrt images for multi - wavelength analysis of sources .",
    "in addition , the source of errors was not investigated . at mrt",
    ", the visibility data is processed through several complex stages of data reduction specific to the array , especially , arising due to its non - coplanarity  @xcite .",
    "it was therefore decided to correct for errors in the image domain and avoid re - processing the visibility data .",
    "this paper describes the application of 2-d homography , a technique ubiquitous in the computer vision and graphics community , to correct the errors in the image domain .",
    "homography is used to estimate a transformation matrix ( which includes rotation , translation and non - isotropic scaling ) that accounts for positional errors in the linearly gridded 2-d images . in our view , this technique will be of relevance to the new generation radio telescopes where , owing to huge data rates , only images after a certain integration would be recorded as opposed to raw visibilities  @xcite .",
    "this paper also describes our investigations tracing the positional errors to errors in the array geometry used for imaging .",
    "our hypothesis on the array geometry , its subsequent confirmation endorsed by re - estimation of the array geometry and its effect on the images are also described .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ s : poserror ] compares positions of sources common to mrt catalogue and mrc .",
    "the 2-d homography estimation is briefly described in section  [ s : homography ] .",
    "section  [ s : scheme ] presents the correction scheme and typical results .",
    "the re - estimation of mrt array geometry is described in section  [ s : arraygeometry ] .",
    "finally , we summarise and present our conclusions in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "the positions of sources common to mrt catalogue and mrc were compared .",
    "we used mrc because of its overlap with mrt survey , its proximity in frequency compared to other reliable catalogues available and , comparable resolution @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , for sources of listed flux density  @xmath23  jy ( at 408  mhz ) the catalogue is reported to be substantially complete and , the reliability is reported to be 99.9%  @xcite . for our further discussions , errors in mrc source positions are considered random , without any systematics .",
    "about 400 bright sources common to the two catalogues and with flux density at 151.5  mhz greater than 5  jy ( @xmath24-@xmath0 ) were identified and their positions were compared .",
    "the sources were labelled as common if they lie within @xmath25 of each other .",
    "since mrc has a source density of @xmath26  source  deg@xmath27 , the chances of considering two unrelated sources as common are extremely low .",
    "a flux threshold of 15-@xmath0 ensures a source population abundant to reliably estimate homography ( explained in next section ) .",
    "the positional errors in @xmath6 and @xmath3 show no systematics as a function of @xmath6 ( refer _ first rows _ of fig .",

    "the errors in @xmath6 , plotted against @xmath14 , reach @xmath28 of the mrt beamwidth ( refer _ second row _ of fig .  [",

    "the histogram of errors in @xmath3 shows a broader spread compared to errors in @xmath6 .",
    "re - imaging , to correct for errors in the images , would involve re - reducing the @xmath31 hours of observed data .",
    "owing to the complexity involved it was decided to correct for the positional errors in the images , thus avoiding re - processing .",
    "the 2-d homography estimation technique was employed for correcting positional errors in images and is discussed in detail in the following section .",
    "the 2-d planar homography is a non - singular linear relationship between points on planes .",
    "given two sets of @xmath32 corresponding image points in projective coordinates , @xmath33 , homography maps @xmath34 to the corresponding @xmath35 @xcite .",

    "are referred to as the _ homogeneous coordinates _ and are always represented one dimension higher than the dimension of the problem space .",
    "this is a commonly used representation in computer graphics .",
    "the simple reason is that with a @xmath45 matrix one can only _ rotate _ a set of 2-d points around the origin and _ scale _ them towards or away from the origin .",
    "a @xmath45 matrix is incapable of _ translating _ a set of 2-d points .",
    "the homogeneous coordinates allow one to express a translation as a multiplication",
    ". a single @xmath46 matrix , with homogeneous coordinates , can account for rotation , scaling and translation of 2-d coordinates .",
    "for example , from equation  [ eq : inhomog ] , @xmath47 .",
    "notice , @xmath48 ( representing translation in @xmath6-dimension ) is simply being added to the normal dot product @xmath49 that together represents rotation and scaling . in homogeneous coordinates ,",
    "the 2-d problem space is a plane hovering in the third dimension at a unit distance .",
    "a general homography matrix , for projective transformation , has 8 degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) . for our system ,",
    "both errors in @xmath6 and @xmath3 have only @xmath14-dependency .",
    "therefore , a less general , 2-d affine transformation is sufficient .",
    "a 2-d affine transformation ( two rotations , two translations and two scalings ) requires 6-dof  @xcite , therefore in @xmath38 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are zero",
    ". since each 2-d point provides two independent equations , a minimum of 3 point correspondences are necessary to constrain @xmath38 in the affine space .",
    "a set of @xmath32 such equation pairs , contributed by @xmath32 point correspondences , form an over - determined linear system : @xmath52 @xmath53\\mbox { , } \\ ] ] @xmath54^{t}\\mbox{and , } \\ ] ] @xmath55^{t}.\\ ] ] in equation  [ e : system ] , @xmath56 represents transpose of a matrix .",
    "this system can be solved by least squares - based estimators .    at this stage",
    "it is useful to consider the effect of using ( @xmath57)-coordinates to represent the brightness distribution on the celestial sphere . ideally , it is the directional cosines @xmath58 , with respect to the coordinates of the array , which represent the spherical coordinates in the sky .",
    "therefore , the image coordinates in which homography should in principle be estimated are @xmath59 .",
    "however , at mrt , for 1-d imaging on the meridian : @xmath60 therefore , @xmath14 is a natural choice for one of the coordinates and is indeed used in the present case . on the meridian ,",
    "the directional cosine @xmath61 is zero . for small errors , @xmath62 , in @xmath61 , i.e. close to the meridian :    @xmath63    @xmath64    [ e : sinza ]    here",
    ", @xmath65 is the error in @xmath6 .",
    "equation  [ e : sinza ] shows that an error in @xmath61 will lead to an error in @xmath6 with a @xmath66-dependence .",
    "the 2-d images of mrt are 1-d images on the meridian made at different sidereal times and stacked .",
    "therefore , positional errors both in @xmath6 and @xmath3 do not show systematics as a function of @xmath6 ( _ first rows _ of figs .",
    "[ f : sourcecomparison]a  and  [ f : sourcecomparison]b ) .",
    "we preferred @xmath42-representation because all mrt images were already generated in this coordinate system .",
    "this choice compelled us to seek solutions for errors in @xmath6 as a function of @xmath14 rather than @xmath66 .",
    "we plotted errors in @xmath6 against both @xmath66 and @xmath14 and obtained separate linear least - squares fits .",
    "the rms of residuals in both fits is @xmath67 of the beamwidth in @xmath6 .",
    "however , the rms of difference between the fitting functions @xmath66 and @xmath14 in the @xmath3 range of mrt @xmath68 is only @xmath69 of the beamwidth in @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the random errors in the source positions are larger than the errors introduced by the preferred @xmath42-coordinates for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "the @xmath6 ranges from 18 hours to 24 hours and the @xmath14 ranges from @xmath70 to @xmath71 ( corresponding to the declination range of @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) .",
    "moreover , in matrix @xmath74 ( refer equation  [ e : system ] ) there are entries of 1 s & 0 s .",
    "such a matrix is ill - conditioned and in the presence of noise in the source positions , the solution for an over - determined system may diverge from the correct estimate  @xcite .",
    "the effect of an ill - conditioned matrix is that it amplifies the divergence .",
    "a normalisation ( or pre - conditioning ) is therefore required .      to obtain a good estimate of the transformation matrix we adopted the normalisation scheme proposed by @xcite .",
    "the normalisation ensures freedom on arbitrary choices of scale and coordinate origin , leading to algebraic minimisation in a fixed canonical frame .",
    "the homography matrix @xmath75 is estimated from normalised coordinates by the least - squares method using singular value decomposition ( svd ) .",
