    "one of the many obstacles posed by rightfully skeptical physicists against the warp drive is the appearance of horizons when a ship travels at superluminal velocities ( see figure [ horizonform ] ) .",
    "this is a problem , to control the speed of the ship because if the bubble becomes causally disconnected from the ship then observers in the ship frame can not turn off the bubble so the ship can not reduce its velocity .",
    "if the ship becomes causally disconnected from the bubble then possible voyages to messier42 orion nebula at 1500 light - years from earth or messier1 at 6000 light years from earth would be impossible because the ship being causally disconnected from the bubble can not turn off the bubble and can not reach its destination .",
    "if a ship is causally disconnected from the bubble then the warp drive must be turned off from outside the ship s frame and we do nt know if there is  someone out there \" at orion or crab to turn off the run away warp bubble . in this work",
    "we show that while part of the warped region becomes causally disconnected from a ship when the ship is luminal or superluminal the behaviour of that part does not depend on the ship speed and can be engineered while the ship is still subluminal .",
    "also it shown the control region of the ship s velocity remains in the portion of the warped region that is still casually connected to the ship ( see figure [ luminalcontrol ] ) .",
    "in order to explore the superluminal control problem of the warp drive we now set up the mathematics which define the physical horizons ( the red region of figure [ horizonform ] ) . in order to do",
    "so it will be necessary to write a two dimensional esaa metric written in the alcubierre formalism : ds^2=-a^2dt^2+[dx - v_sf(r_s)dt]^2 where @xmath0 @xmath1 requiring that ds^2=-a^2dt^2+[dx+v_sdt - v_sf(r_s)dt]^2 where we can replace with ds^2=-a^2dt^2+[dx+v_sdt(1-f(r_s))]^2 for simplicity we write @xmath2 so that we arrive at : ds^2=-a^2dt^2+dx^2 + 2v_ss(r_s)dxdt+(v_ss(r_s))^2dt^2 which leads to ds^2=a^2dt^2-(v_ss(r_s))^2dt^2 - 2v_ss(r_s)dxdt - dx^2 or ds^2=[a^2-(v_ss(r_s))^2]dt^2 - 2v_ss(r_s)dxdt - dx^2 [ proposed ] thereby arriving at a two - dimensional esaa spacetime necessary to discuss the mathematics behind the ` horizon problem , ' and how to overcome it .      in order to discuss the ` horizon problem ' we will be improving upon the paradigm set forth by hiscock .",
    "such that an esaa - hiscock ship frame metric can be written from : ds^2=-h(r_s)dt^2 + a^2(r_s)dx^2h(r_s ) [ horizon1 ] with dt = dt - v_ss(r_s)h(r_s)dx such that we can receive @xmath3 by choosing h(r_s)= a^2-(v_ss(r_s))^2 [ horizon ] we have a horizon function .",
    "we can thus have the corresponding line element @xmath4 which reduces to ds^2=-h(r_s)dt^2 + 2v_ss(r_s)dxdt + dx^2 or ds^2 = - [ a^2 - ( v_ss(r_s))^2]dt^2 + 2v_ss(r_s)dxdt + dx^2 [ propst ]",
