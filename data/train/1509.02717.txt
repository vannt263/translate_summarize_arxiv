    "a one - relator product of groups is the quotient of a free product by the normal closure of a single element , called the _ relator_. in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the following conjecture was proposed .",
    "[ con ] a one - relator product on three non - trivial groups is non - trivial .",
    "conjecture [ con ] is an extension of the scott - wiegold conjecture ( see problem 5.53 in @xcite ) .",
    "the latter problem was solved by the second author @xcite , who also conjectured that a free product of @xmath1 groups is not the normal closure of @xmath2 elements .",
    "our aim in this paper is to prove conjecture [ con ] under certain conditions .",
    "first we assume that the factors are all finite cyclic groups . under this condition the conjecture is already known @xcite , but here we prove a stronger result .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 be non - trivial cyclic groups with generators @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . for any word @xmath9",
    "whose exponent sum in each of the generators is non - zero modulo the order of that generator , each of the factors @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 embed in @xmath10 via the natural maps .",
    "an immediate consequence ( corollary [ fhsfactor ] ) is that in any one - relator product @xmath0 of three cyclic groups , at least one of the factors embeds in @xmath0 ; this is conjecture 9.4 of @xcite for cyclic groups .",
    "also we can place a restriction on the length of the relator .",

    "placing an upper bound on the relator allows us to apply techniques in combinatorial group theory such as pictures .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "chapter 2 discusses pictures .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , pictures combined with curvature arguments ( discussed in chapter 3 ) are used in the proof of theorem [ t2 ] . in chapters 4 and 5 ,",
    "we give a proof of theorems [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] respectively .    throughout",
    ", we shall use the following notations .",
    "normal closure , @xmath11 ; length , @xmath12 ; real part , @xmath13 ; imaginary part , @xmath14 ; homeomorphic , @xmath15 ; conjugate , @xmath16 ; isomorphic , @xmath17 ; union @xmath18 , and disjoint union , @xmath19 .",
    "pictures are one of the most powerful tools available in combinatorial group theory .",
    "essentially , pictures are the duals of van kampen diagrams @xcite",
    ". we will describe pictures briefly as it relates to groups with presentations of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a word with free product length at least two .",
    "groups of the form @xmath0 above are called _ one - relator products of groups @xmath24 and @xmath25_. in the next section we shall discuss such groups in more details .",
    "pictures were first introduced by rourke @xcite and adapted to work for such groups ( as @xmath0 ) by short @xcite . since then they have been used extensively and successfully by various authors in a variety of different ways ( see [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) .",
    "we describe below the basic idea , following closely the account in @xcite . a more detailed description can be found in @xcite and also [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be as above , a picture @xmath26 over @xmath0 on an oriented surface @xmath27 ( usually @xmath28 ) consists of the following :    1 .",
    "a collection of disjoint closed discs in the interior of @xmath27 called vertices ; 2 .   a finite number of disjoint arcs , each of which is either : 1 .   a simple closed curve in the interior of @xmath27 that meets no vertex , 2 .   an arc joining two vertices ( or one vertex to itself ) , 3 .   an arc joining a vertex to the boundary @xmath29 of @xmath27 , or 4 .   an arc joining @xmath29 to @xmath29 ; 3 .   a collection of labels , one at each corner of each region of @xmath27 ( i.e. connected component of the complement in @xmath27 of the arcs and vertices ) at a vertex , and one along each component of the intersection of the region with @xmath29 .",
    "the label at each corner is an element of @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "reading the labels round a vertex in the clockwise direction yields @xmath30 ( up to cyclic permutation ) , as a cyclically reduced word in @xmath31 .",
    "a region is a boundary region if it meets @xmath29 , and an interior region otherwise .",
    "if @xmath32 or if @xmath33 and no arcs of meet @xmath28 , then @xmath26 is called _ spherical_. in the latter case @xmath34 is one of the boundary components of a non - simply connected region ( provided , of course , that @xmath26 contains at least one vertex or arc ) , which is called the _",
    "exceptional region_. all other regions are interior .",
    "the labels of any region @xmath35 of @xmath26 are required all to belong to either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "hence we can refer to regions as @xmath24-regions and @xmath25-regions accordingly .",
    "similarly a corner is called a @xmath36-corner or more specially a @xmath37-corner if it is labelled by the element @xmath38 .",
    "each arc is required to separate a @xmath24-region from a @xmath25-region .",
    "observe that this is compatible with the alignment of regions around a vertex , where the labels spell a cyclically reduced word , so must come alternately from @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "a region bounded by arcs that are closed curves will have no labels ; nevertheless the above convention requires that it be designated a @xmath24- or @xmath25-region .",
    "an important rule for pictures is that the labels within any @xmath24-region ( respectively @xmath25-region ) allow the solution of a quadratic equation in @xmath24 ( respectively @xmath25 ) .",
    "the labels around any given boundary component of the region are formed into a single word read anti - clockwise .",
    "the resulting collection of elements of @xmath24 or @xmath25 is required to have genus no greater than that of the region ( in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "this technical general requirement is much simpler in the commonest case of a simply connected region - it means merely that the resulting word represents the identity element in @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "two distinct vertices of a picture are said to _ cancel _ along an arc @xmath39 if they are joined by @xmath39 and if their labels , read from the endpoints of @xmath39 , are mutually inverse words in @xmath40 .",
    "such vertices can be removed from a picture via a sequence of _ bridge moves _ ( see figure [ bridge ] and @xcite for more details ) , followed by deletion of a _ dipole _ without changing the boundary label .",
    "a _ dipole _ is a connected spherical picture containing precisely two vertices , does not meet @xmath29 , and none of its interior regions contain other components of @xmath26 .",
    "this gives an alternative picture with the same boundary label and two fewer vertices .",
    "we say that a picture @xmath26 is _ reduced _ if it can not be altered by bridge moves to a picture with a pair of cancelling vertices . if @xmath41 is a set of words , then a picture is @xmath41-_minimal _ if it is non - empty and has the minimum number of vertices amongst all pictures over @xmath0 with boundary label in @xmath41 .",
    "any cyclically reduced word in @xmath40 representing the identity element of @xmath0 occurs as the boundary label of some reduced picture on @xmath28 .",
    "a picture is _ connected _ if the union of its vertices and arcs is connected . in particular ,",
    "no arc of a connected picture is a closed arc or joins two points of @xmath29 , unless the picture consists only of that arc .",
    "two arcs of @xmath26 are said to be _",
    "parallel _ if they are the only two arcs in the boundary of some simply - connected region @xmath42 of @xmath26 .",
    "we will also use the term _ parallel _ to denote the equivalence relation generated by this relation , and refer to any of the corresponding equivalence classes as a _ class of @xmath43 parallel arcs _ or _",
    "@xmath43-zone_. given a _",
    "@xmath43-zone _ joining vertices @xmath44 and @xmath45 of @xmath26 , consider the @xmath46 two - sided regions separating these arcs .",
    "each such region has a corner label @xmath47 at @xmath44 and a corner label @xmath48 at @xmath45 , and the picture axioms imply that @xmath49 in @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52 corner labels at @xmath45 spell a cyclic subword @xmath53 of length @xmath54 of the label of @xmath45 .",
    "similarly the corner labels at @xmath44 spell out a cyclic subword @xmath55 of length @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 . if we assume that @xmath26 is reduced , then @xmath44 and @xmath45 do not cancel .",
    "hence the cyclic permutations of the labels at @xmath45 and @xmath44 of which @xmath53 and @xmath55 are initial segments respectively are not equal . hence @xmath55 and @xmath53 are _ pieces_.",
    "for any compact orientable surface ( with or without boundary ) @xmath27 with a triangulation , we assign real numbers @xmath57 to the corners of the faces in @xmath27 .",
    "we will think of these numbers as interior angles .",
    "a vertex which is on @xmath29 is called a boundary vertex , and otherwise interior .",
    "the _ curvature _ of an interior vertex @xmath45 in @xmath27 is defined as    @xmath58 \\pi,\\ ] ]    where the @xmath59 range over the angles at @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath45 is a boundary vertex then we define    @xmath60 \\pi.\\ ] ]    the curvature of a face @xmath61 is defined as    @xmath62 \\pi\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 are the interior angles of @xmath61 .",
    "the combinatorial version of the gauss - bonnet theorem states that the total curvature is the multiple of euler characteristic of the surface by @xmath64 :    @xmath65 \\pi=2\\pi\\chi(\\mathcal{s}).\\ ] ]    we use curvature to prove results by showing that this value can not be realised .",
    "we assign to each corner of a region of degree @xmath66 an angle @xmath67 .",
    "this will mean that regions are flat in the sense that they have zero curvature ( alternatively we can make vertices flat instead ) .",
    "this will be the standard assignment for this work .",
    "in other words , wherever curvature is mentioned with no specified assignments , it is implicitly assumed that we are using the one described above .    in some cases",
    ", it may be needful to redistribute curvature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this involves locating positively - curved vertices ( or regions ) , and using its excess curvature to compensate its negatively curved neighbours .",
    "hence the total curvature is preserved .",
    "we shall describe how to do this in section 5 .",
    "in this section we give a proof of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "recall that @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a word in the free product @xmath72 with non - zero exponent sum in each of the generators @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the proof we present follows closely the one in @xcite .",
    "[ fr ] suppose that @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are prime powers .",
    "then each of @xmath76 embeds via the natural map into @xmath77    we know the result holds when @xmath78 are primes by [ @xcite , theorem 4.1 ] .",
    "he we assume that at least one of @xmath78 is a prime power but not prime .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is the exponent sum of @xmath6 in @xmath71 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath2 is not divisible by @xmath73 implies that @xmath79 with @xmath80 . by replacing @xmath71 with @xmath81 which changes @xmath2 to @xmath53 ( leaving @xmath0 unchanged )",
    ", we can always assume that @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath83 is co - prime to @xmath73 then @xmath84 induces an automorphism of @xmath85 .",
    "thus , replacing @xmath6 by @xmath86 in @xmath71 gives a new word @xmath87 such that the resulting group @xmath88 is isomorphic to @xmath0 ( and such that @xmath85 embeds in @xmath89 if and only if it embeds in @xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , the exponent sum of @xmath6 in @xmath90 is @xmath91 . by bezout",
    "s lemma we may choose @xmath83 such that @xmath92 .",
    "thus without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath2 divides @xmath73 ( and similarly the exponent sums of @xmath93 in @xmath71 divide @xmath94 respectively ) .",
    "so in particular if @xmath73 is prime , then @xmath95 .    now suppose that @xmath73 and @xmath2 ( the exponent sum of @xmath6 in @xmath71 ) are powers of a prime @xmath96 ",
    "say @xmath97 and @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath96 is an odd prime , define @xmath100 if @xmath101 , define    @xmath102    unless @xmath103 , in which case define @xmath104 . recall that an element @xmath105 has order @xmath73 if and only if @xmath106 is a multiple of @xmath107 but not @xmath108 , for any vector @xmath109 .",
    "hence for any @xmath109 , the map @xmath110 induces a faithful representation @xmath111 ( where @xmath112 denotes the quaternions ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "similarly , we can define maps @xmath116 and @xmath117 that induce faithful representations @xmath118 , and such that , if @xmath119 denote the exponent - sums of @xmath93 in @xmath71 , then @xmath120 and @xmath121 where @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "the numbers @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 satisfy a triangle inequality .",
    "in other words none is greater than the sum of the other two .",
    "hence , for example , the triple @xmath126 induces a homomorphism    @xmath127    that sends @xmath71 to @xmath128 with @xmath129 . if @xmath130 then @xmath131 induces a representation @xmath132 that is faithful on each of @xmath76 and we are done .",
    "so assume that @xmath133 .",
    "in other words @xmath134 .",
    "similar remarks apply to the triples @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "hence also the triple @xmath137 induces a representation @xmath131 with @xmath138 .",
    "the map @xmath139 , @xmath140 is an @xmath141-equivariant map under the conjugation action .",
    "it follows that it either sends some @xmath142 to @xmath143 ( in which case @xmath144 gives a representation @xmath132 that is faithful on each of @xmath76 ) , or by [ @xcite corollary 2.2 ] , it represents @xmath145 .    similarly , the map @xmath146 either maps some @xmath109 to @xmath147 and so gives a representation @xmath132 that is faithful on each of @xmath76 , or represents one of @xmath148 .",
    "now any path @xmath149\\to s^2 $ ] from @xmath150 to @xmath151 gives rise to a homotopy    @xmath152    between the above two maps .",
    "if @xmath153 for all @xmath55 and for all @xmath142 , then we can regard this as a homotopy of maps @xmath154 .",
    "this is a contradiction since the two maps belong to different homology classes in @xmath155 .",
    "hence for some @xmath55 and some @xmath109 , the map @xmath156 sends @xmath71 to @xmath157 and so induces a representation @xmath132 that is faithful on each of @xmath158 and @xmath5 .",
    "it follows that each of the natural maps from @xmath158 and @xmath5 to @xmath0 is injective , as required .    the general case of the freiheitssatz for @xmath0 follows from the special case of prime powers together with the chinese remainder theorem by an easy induction .",
    "for the inductive step , suppose that @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "since the exponent sum of the generator @xmath6 in @xmath71 is non - zero modulo @xmath73 , we can assume that it is non - zero modulo @xmath83 .",
    "now factor out @xmath86 and apply the inductive hypothesis .",
    "this shows that the maps @xmath161 and @xmath162 are injective .",
    "it also shows that the kernel @xmath163 of @xmath164 is contained in the subgroup @xmath165 .",
    "if the exponent sum of @xmath6 in @xmath71 is also non - zero modulo @xmath2 , then by interchanging the roles of @xmath83 and @xmath2 in the above we see that @xmath163 is contained in @xmath166 .",
    "however , if the exponent - sum of @xmath6 in @xmath71 is divisible by @xmath2 , then the same is automatically true : @xmath163 is contained in @xmath166 .",
    "finally , we know that @xmath163 is contained in the intersection of @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "but this intersection is trivial by the chinese remainder theorem , so we deduce that @xmath164 is injective .    in a one - relator product of groups @xmath167 , we say that a factor group @xmath168 is a _ freiheitssatz factor _ if the natural map @xmath169 is injective .",
    "it is clear that any @xmath168 such that the product of the @xmath168-letters in @xmath23 is trivial is a freiheitssatz factor .",
    "combining this remark with theorem [ fr ] we obtain :    [ fhsfactor ] any one - relator product of three cyclic groups contains a freiheitssatz factor .    in @xcite , chiodo used the result of @xcite to show that the free product @xmath0 of three cyclic groups of distinct prime orders is _",
    "finitely annihiliated_. in other words , for every non - trivial element @xmath170 , there exist a finite index normal subgroup @xmath171 of @xmath0 such that @xmath172 is trivial in @xmath173 .",
    "the proof uses nothing more than the fact that finitely generated subgroups of @xmath174 are residually finite .",
    "hence our result extends this to the case where the cyclic groups are arbitrary .    any free product of three cyclic groups is finitely annihiliated .",
    "in this section we give a proof of theorem [ t2 ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction the proof uses pictures , as well as bass - serre theory and nielsen transformations , and is broken down into a number of lemmas .",
    "also we shall need the following results .",
    "[ t33 ] suppose that @xmath175 and @xmath176 are non - cyclic two - generator groups with generators @xmath177 and @xmath178 respectively .",
    "if @xmath175 and @xmath176 have faithful representations in @xmath179 , then @xmath180 satisfies the freiheitssatz : the natural maps @xmath181 and @xmath182 are injective .",
    "let @xmath183 and @xmath184 be variable matrices in @xmath185 .",
    "the aim of the proof is to show that one can choose @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath184 such that @xmath188 , @xmath189 gives a faithful representation @xmath190 and @xmath191 , @xmath192 gives a faithful representation @xmath193 .",
    "such a triple of matrices is a representation of the free group @xmath194 of rank 3 .",
    "recall @xcite that the character variety of representations @xmath195 is given by the seven parameters tr@xmath196 ) , tr@xmath197 , tr@xmath198 , tr@xmath199 , tr@xmath200 , tr@xmath201 and tr@xmath202 subject to a single polynomial equation      by hypothesis , faithful representations of @xmath175 and @xmath176 in @xmath179 exist .",
    "moreover they are parametrised by fixing suitable values for tr@xmath196 ) , tr@xmath197 , tr@xmath200 , tr@xmath198 , tr@xmath202 and @xmath204 . by the repeated application of trace relation @xmath205 for arbitrary matrices @xmath206 and @xmath171 can write : @xmath207 hence if we fix suitable values for tr@xmath208 , tr@xmath198 , tr@xmath197 , tr@xmath200 and tr@xmath202 , we have two free variables @xmath209 and @xmath210 which are required to satisfy the quadratic equation which fixes the value of        @xmath213 @xmath214 for suitable constants @xmath215 .",
    "it is routine to check that any such pair of equations can be solved in @xmath216 .",
    "any solution gives a representation @xmath217 that induces the given faithful representations of @xmath175 and @xmath176 in @xmath179 up to conjugacy , mapping the word @xmath218 to the identity element .",
    "this completes the proof .",

    "theorem [ t1 ] holds trivially if @xmath71 is in the normal closure of any of the factors .",

    "[ nel ] in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above we gave two forms of @xmath241 . if @xmath401 we can replace @xmath240 and @xmath241 by @xmath402 and @xmath403 respectively ( or equivalently replace @xmath281 by @xmath404 ) and interchange @xmath175 and @xmath176 to get the first form , @xmath405 .    in what follows",
    "we regard @xmath0 as a one - relator product of @xmath242 and @xmath281 . for convenience we let @xmath406 and @xmath407 , so @xmath408 .",
    "we use @xmath23 to denote a relator in @xmath0 which is a cyclically reduced word in @xmath345 and @xmath409 denotes its length also as a word in @xmath345 .      definition [ index ] generalizes the notion of sign - index .",
    "recall that the sign - index of @xmath23 is @xmath2 ( necessarily even ) if a cyclic permutation of @xmath23 has the form @xmath414 with each @xmath415 a positive word in @xmath345 . in particular the index of @xmath23",

    "we transfer @xmath450 of curvature across each of the edges of @xmath61 joining a @xmath449-corner to @xmath448-corner of an adjacent @xmath281-region .",

    "however , @xmath455 by remark [ nr ] . hence it has transferred at least @xmath456 of curvature to neighbours , so becomes negatively curved .",
    "similarly , it follows from proposition [ positive ] that any interior @xmath452-region whose label is not of the form @xmath453 has curvature at most @xmath456 and that it has transferred at least @xmath456 of curvature to neighbours , so it becomes non - positively curved as well .",
    "a @xmath281-region @xmath61 receives @xmath450 of positive curvature across each edge separating a @xmath449-corner from a @xmath448-corner .",
    "suppose that in @xmath61 there are @xmath457 @xmath449-corners , @xmath458 @xmath448-corners , and @xmath75 edges separating a @xmath449-corner from a @xmath448-corner .",
    "the curvature of @xmath61 after transfer is at most      if @xmath460 , then @xmath61 still has non - positive curvature after transfer .",
    "suppose @xmath61 is an interior @xmath281-region and @xmath461 .",
    "then either @xmath462 or @xmath463 ( since @xmath464 ) .",
    "hence also @xmath465 : so there is no transfer of curvature into @xmath61 and it remains non - positively curved .         when @xmath468 .",
    "the figure on the left corresponds to a vertex of @xmath26 when @xmath469 and the other is when @xmath470.,title=\"fig : \" ]   when @xmath468 .",
    "the figure on the left corresponds to a vertex of @xmath26 when @xmath469 and the other is when @xmath470.,title=\"fig : \" ]    by assumption @xmath471 , and is isomorphic to @xmath472 , where @xmath473 is the order of @xmath419 .",
    "consider the relative presentation @xmath474 the aim is to show that @xmath0 is the free product of @xmath264 and @xmath242 amalgamated over the subgroups @xmath418 and @xmath475 . to this end",
    "we must show that the latter is also isomorphic to @xmath472 .",
    "in other words , any relation in @xmath264 which is a word in @xmath476 is a consequence of @xmath477 .",
    "if this is not so , we obtain a @xmath41-minimal non - trivial picture @xmath26 over @xmath264 on @xmath28 where @xmath41 is the set of non - trivial words in @xmath476 .",
    "figure [ figs ] shows typical vertices with positive orientation in the case of @xmath468 .",
    "note that there are no @xmath320-zones with corners labelled by @xmath478 , for in such case , either the two vertices cancel , or we can combine the vertex with the boundary . in both cases",
    "we get a smaller picture , thereby contradicting minimality of @xmath26 .",
    "make regions of @xmath26 _ flat _ by assigning angle @xmath479 to each of the corners of a degree @xmath480 region @xmath61 .",
    "we claim that interior vertices @xmath26 are non - positively curved .",
    "the proof is in two stages depending on whether @xmath481 or @xmath482 .",
    "suppose that @xmath481 . since @xmath75 is a positive word , @xmath26 is bipartite .",
    "more precisely , only vertices of opposite orientations are adjacent in @xmath26 .",
    "in particular this implies that regions have even degrees .",
    "every interior vertex @xmath45 bounds at least two regions with a corner labelled @xmath310 . by minimality of @xmath26 ,",
    "every such region has degree at least @xmath483 .",
    "also every @xmath320-zone gives the relation @xmath484 , and so each of the two regions on both sides of the @xmath320-zone has a corner labelled @xmath310 , hence is at least a @xmath483-gon .",
    "hence @xmath45 bounds at least four regions of degree at least @xmath483 and so is non - positively curved .",
    "the case of @xmath485 is slightly different as regions can have odd degree .",
    "note that any corner is either a _ source _ ( the two arrows point outwards ) , _ sink _ ( the two arrows point inwards ) , or _ saddle _",
    "( one arrow points inwards and the other points outwards ) depending on whether it is a @xmath449- , @xmath448- or @xmath310-corner ( see figure [ figs ] ) .",
    "so in particular any @xmath320-zone gives the relation @xmath486 or @xmath487 .",
    "if an interior vertex @xmath45 does not bound a @xmath320-zone , then @xmath45 satisfies @xmath488 .",
    "suppose it does .",
    "as before any region adjacent to a @xmath320-zone has a @xmath310-corner ( a saddle ) . but",
    "any region must have an even number of saddles , no two of which are adjacent ( for otherwise a cancellation would be possible ) .",
    "it follows that such a region has degree at least @xmath483 .",
    "there are at least two regions with @xmath310-corner at @xmath45 . if @xmath45 bounds only one @xmath320-zone , then it has degree at least @xmath437 and bounds at least three regions of degree @xmath483",
    ". otherwise @xmath45 bounds at least four @xmath483-gons . in all cases @xmath45 has non - positive curvature .",
    "it follows that there exists a boundary vertex of degree at most @xmath421 .",
    "this is clearly impossible if @xmath455 ( since we will get a @xmath320-zone with corners labelled @xmath310 ) .",
    "so we assume that @xmath468 .",
    "an argument similar to the ones given above shows that such a vertex must connect to @xmath34 by an @xmath43-zone , with @xmath489 .",
    "it follows that either one of @xmath449 or @xmath448 is trivial or we can combine such a vertex with @xmath34 to get a smaller picture .",
    "both possibilities lead to a contradiction which completes the proof .    by earlier comments we can assume @xmath490 and @xmath71 has the form @xmath491 ( up to cyclic permutation ) where @xmath492 and @xmath493 with @xmath494 .",
