    "<S> we studied the thermodynamics of the one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 spin-1/2 heisenberg chain for ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor bonds @xmath2 and frustrating antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor bonds @xmath3 using full diagonalization of finite rings and a second - order green - function formalism . thereby we focus on @xmath4 where the ground state is still ferromagnetic , but the frustration influences the thermodynamic properties . </S>",

    "<S> another effect of the frustration is the appearance of an extra low-@xmath9 maximum in the specific heat @xmath10 for @xmath11 , indicating its strong influence on the low - energy spectrum .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction : _ in low - dimensional frustrated quantum magnets thermal and quantum fluctuations strongly influence the low - temperature physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> special attention has been paid to one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0-@xmath1 quantum heisenberg magnets , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental studies have shown that edge - shared chain cuprates , such as livcuo@xmath12 , li(na)cu@xmath13o@xmath13 , li@xmath13zrcuo@xmath12 , and li@xmath13cuo@xmath13 @xcite , represent a family of quantum magnets for which the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg model is a good starting point for a theoretical description . </S>",
    "<S> the above listed compounds are quasi-1d frustrated spin-@xmath14 magnets with a ferromagnetic ( fm ) nearest - neighbor ( nn ) in - chain coupling @xmath15 and an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) in - chain coupling @xmath16 .    </S>",

    "<S> henceforth we set @xmath18 . for the model ( [ ham ] ) a quantum critical point at @xmath19 exists where the fm ground state ( gs ) gives way for a singlet gs with spiral correlations for @xmath20 @xcite . for most of the edge - shared chain cuprates </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is large enough to realize such a spiral gs . </S>",
    "<S> however , several materials considered as model systems for 1d spin-1/2 ferromagnets , such as tmcuc[(ch@xmath21)@xmath12ncucl@xmath21 ] @xcite and p - npnn ( c@xmath23h@xmath24n@xmath21o@xmath12 ) @xcite , might have also a weak frustrating nnn interaction @xmath25 . moreover , recent studies @xcite lead to the conclusion that li@xmath13cuo@xmath13 is a quasi-1d spin-@xmath14 system with a dominant fm @xmath0 and weak frustrating afm @xmath26 . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the parameter region @xmath27 , i.e.   the gs is ferromagnetic . only at @xmath19 </S>",

    "<S> the frustrating @xmath1 influences the low - energy excitations , in particular , if @xmath1 is close to the quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the frustration may have a strong effect on the low-@xmath9 thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we mention that previous studies @xcite of the thermodynamics of the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 model with fm @xmath0 did not consider values of @xmath1 near the quantum critical point @xmath28 .    to study the thermodynamic properties we use the full exact diagonalization ( ed ) of finite rings of up to @xmath29 lattice sites , complemented by data obtained by a spin - rotation - invariant second - order green - function method ( rgm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that by contrast to ed the rgm is limited to values @xmath30 @xcite but yields results for @xmath31 , that allows the calculation of the correlation length by the rgm . here </S>",
    "<S> we will present data for the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath32 , the uniform static spin susceptibility @xmath5 and the specific heat @xmath33 . for the discussion of the correlation length of the model ( [ ham ] ) , see ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the correlation functions decrease , where the further - distant correlators decay much stronger than the nn correlator . near and at the quantum critical point the large - distant correlator @xmath42 vanishes already at @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 the correlator @xmath42 changes the sign and goes through a minimum . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is not affected by finite - size effects , e.g. , the correlators @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 also change the sign and go through a minimum for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .    </S>",

    "<S> recently it has been confirmed that the critical indices for the susceptibility and the correlation length , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , are not changed by frustration for @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the quantum critical point @xmath19 a change of the low - temperature physics is expected @xcite . to study that question we consider the expansion @xmath57 related to the existence of the fm critical point at @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been derived for @xmath37 in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> [ c - h0-verschn ] it is obvious that the extra low-@xmath9 finite - size peak behaves monotonously with @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we have performed a finite - size extrapolation to @xmath87 of the height @xmath88 and the position @xmath89 of the peak in @xmath63 using the formula @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated values @xmath78 and @xmath79 are shown in the insets of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ c - h0-verschn ] . obviously , @xmath91 even near the quantum critical point @xmath92 , where @xmath93 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath79 decreases with @xmath1 and becomes very small near @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior suggests that a characteristic steep decay of @xmath63 down to zero starts at very low @xmath9 when approaching @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> we discussed the thermodynamics of frustrated fm spin-1/2 @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg chains and found as prominent features ( i ) a change of the low-@xmath9 critical behavior at the quantum critical point @xmath8 , ( ii ) and an additional low-@xmath9 maximum in the specific heat for @xmath95 .    </S>",
