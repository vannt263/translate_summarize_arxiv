    "suppose that one has observed an incomplete portion @xmath1 of some larger complete network @xmath2 . to learn more about the structure of @xmath2 , one can probe nodes from @xmath1 , where each such probe reveals all the neighbors of the selected node in @xmath2 .",
    "the question we address here is : which nodes in @xmath1 should be probed to observe as many nodes as possible in @xmath2 ?",
    "this question is related to previous works on graph sampling and crawling . however , unlike much of the work in graph sampling , we are not attempting to generate a sample from scratch . instead , we are studying how one can enhance or improve an existing incomplete network observation , without control over how it was generated or observed .",
    "our work is motivated by problems where one only has a partial observation of the complete network ; but needs the most accurate and informative picture of the complete network .",
    "for example , suppose a network administrator who has partially observed a computer network through traceroutes .",
    "which parts of the observed network should she more closely examine to get the best ( i.e. , most complete ) view of the entire network ? with a limited probing budget , how should this further exploration be done ? alternatively , suppose that one has obtained a sample of the twitter network from another researcher .",
    "the sample was ( most likely ) collected for some other purpose , and so may not contain the most useful structural information for one s purposes . how should one best supplement",
    "/ enrich this sampled data ?",
    "we present a novel algorithm , called maxoutprobe , whose goal is to select @xmath0 nodes in @xmath1 for probing , such that the greatest number of new nodes are brought into @xmath1 .",
    "maxoutprobe achieves this goal by ranking each node @xmath3 in @xmath1 based on its estimate of have many neighbors @xmath3 has outside of @xmath1 .",
    "it then selects the top @xmath0 nodes in this ranking .",
    "in particular , maxoutprobe consists of two steps : ( 1 ) _ estimation _ and ( 2 ) _",
    "selection_. first , during _ estimation _",
    ", for each node @xmath3 in @xmath1 , maxoutprobe estimates @xmath3 s true degree in @xmath2 ; it also estimates @xmath2 s average clustering coefficient .",
    "second , during _ selection _ , maxoutprobe uses these two quantities to estimate the number of nodes outside @xmath1 to which @xmath3 is adjacent .",
    "the @xmath0 nodes that are estimated to have the most neighbors outside the incomplete network are selected for probing .",
    "we evaluate maxoutprobe on six network datasets , using incomplete networks observed by four popular sampling method , and show that maxoutprobe selects nodes for probing that are more valuable than those selected by comparison methods .",
    "the * contributions * of our paper are as follows :    * we present maxoutprobe , a two - step algorithm that first estimates graph statistics , and then selects probes in accordance with those statistics . unlike existing methods on estimating network characteristics , maxoutprobe does not assume knowledge of how the incomplete network was observed , and estimates the relevant statistics without such background knowledge . * our experiments demonstrate that with respect to the task of bringing as many nodes as possible into the incomplete network , the graphs obtained by probing nodes according to maxoutprobe are substantially better than those by competing methods .",
    "we are given an incomplete , partially observed graph @xmath1 that is a part of a larger , fully observed graph @xmath2 .",
    "we wish to gain broader observability of @xmath2 ; that is , we wish to observe as many nodes as possible in @xmath2 . to aid in this task",
    ", we are allowed to probe a specified number @xmath0 additional nodes in @xmath1 and gain more information about the probed nodes .",
    "thus , the problem at hand is to select the @xmath0 nodes which maximize the number of nodes observed in @xmath2 using only the structure provided in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath4 represent the augmented graph@xmath5i.e .",
    ", @xmath1 with the information obtained from the probes .    in this work ,",
    "_ probing _ a node @xmath3 is defined as learning all of @xmath3 s neighbors ( e.g. , querying facebook for a list of all friends of a user or learning all e - mail contacts of an individual ) .",
    "moreover , there is no ` master list ' of nodes in @xmath2 that allows an algorithm to probe nodes it has not yet seen .",
    "thus , only nodes that already exist in @xmath1 can be probed .",
    "figure  [ fig : probingoverview ] illustrates the probing process .",
    "red nodes in @xmath1 have already been fully explored .",
    "yellow nodes are present in @xmath1 , but have not yet been fully explored : these are the candidates for probing .",
    "green nodes are not yet present in @xmath1 , and we have no knowledge of them . by probing yellow nodes , we learn about the existence of the green node .",
    "we refer to the red nodes as ` fully explored ' , and the yellow nodes as ` unexplored ' .",
    "given a budget of @xmath0 nodes to probe , maxoutprobe selects which @xmath0 unprobed nodes in @xmath1 ( i.e. , yellow nodes in figure  [ fig : probingoverview ] ) are adjacent to many nodes outside @xmath1 ( i.e. , green nodes in figure  [ fig : probingoverview ] ) .",
    "maxoutprobe does not make assumptions about how @xmath1 was observed .",
    "maxoutprobe has two steps : estimation and selection . during the estimation step ,",
    "a small amount of budget is used to probe nodes from @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting information is used to estimate necessary statistics of @xmath2 . during the selection step ,",
    "the statistics estimated during the estimation step are used to score each node in @xmath1 with respect to how many neighbors outside of @xmath1 that node may have .",
    "the highest scoring @xmath0 nodes are then selected for probing .",
    "candidate node _ be a node in @xmath1 that was not fully observed during the process of observing @xmath1 ( i.e. , such a node is a candidate for probing ; a yellow node in figure  [ fig : probingoverview ] ) . for each candidate",
    "node @xmath3 in @xmath1 , maxoutprobe estimates @xmath6 , the number of @xmath3 s neighbors that lie outside of @xmath1 , as follows : @xmath7    where :    * @xmath8 is @xmath3 s true degree in @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity is unknown and must be estimated .",
    "* @xmath9 is the number of nodes in @xmath1 that @xmath3 is adjacent to in @xmath2 .",

    "once @xmath6 has been calculated , maxoutprobe selects the @xmath0 nodes with the highest such values ( where @xmath0 is the probing budget ) .",
    "we next describe how maxoutprobe estimates",
    "each node @xmath3 s true degree @xmath8 as well as the graph s average clustering coefficient @xmath12 , which is used to estimate @xmath13 for each node .",
    "section  [ sec : selection ] describes how maxoutprobe puts these various pieces together to obtain estimates for @xmath6 .",
    "( a ) each candidate node @xmath3 s true degree @xmath8 and ( b ) the graph s clustering coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "note that although there is a large body of work on estimating graph statistics , those works typically assume knowledge about how the graph was observed or generated ( see section  [ sec : related ] ) .",
    "in contrast , maxoutprobe makes no such assumptions .",
    "instead to estimate the necessary statistics of @xmath2 , maxoutprobe performs a series of initial probes .",
    "* estimating node degrees .",
    "* we empirically observe that for incomplete networks , there exists some scale factor @xmath14 such that multiplying @xmath3 s sample degree by @xmath15 gives a good approximation of @xmath8 . thus ,",
    "if maxoutprobe estimates @xmath14 , it can estimate the true degree @xmath8 of every node in the incomplete network by using that node s observed degree . to perform this estimate ,",
    "given a total probing budget of @xmath0 , maxoutprobe begins by identifying the @xmath0 candidate nodes from @xmath1 with the highest degrees in @xmath1 .",
    "a small number of these nodes are randomly selected for probing , and their true degrees in @xmath2 are learned . by taking the average of the ratios of each selected node s true degree to its degree in @xmath1 , maxoutprobe estimates @xmath14 .    * estimating average clustering coefficient . *",
    "recall that the clustering coefficient of a node is the fraction of its neighbors that are connected , divided by the maximum possible such value . for a candidate node @xmath3",
    ", maxoutprobe needs to know how many nodes that are presently two steps away from @xmath3 in @xmath1 are likely to be connected to @xmath3 in @xmath2 .",
    "thus , rather than estimating the global average clustering coefficient or the average clustering coefficient for a candidate node , maxoutprobe must estimate the average clustering coefficient for nodes that are adjacent to the candidate nodes .",
    "it is the clustering coefficient of these neighboring nodes that governs the number @xmath11 . to make this estimation",
    ", maxoutprobe uses the nodes selected for probing during the estimation of @xmath14 , as described above . for each of these selected nodes @xmath3",
    ", maxoutprobe considers each node @xmath16 that was two steps away in @xmath1 .",
    "maxoutprobe then observes whether , after probing @xmath3 , an edge connected @xmath3 to @xmath16 . by averaging these results over all selected nodes @xmath3 , maxoutprobe estimates the average clustering coefficient .",
    "* remarks . * in cases when we know that the incomplete network was observed via random node sampling or random edge sampling , and know what fraction of the complete graph has been observed , it is possible to generate unbiased estimates for the degree of a candidate node and the clustering coefficient of the graph .",
    "the appendix contains the proofs for these claims .",
    "maxoutprobe uses the estimates described above to select the @xmath0 candidate nodes that have the most unobserved neighbors . as before",
    ", @xmath3 is a ( candidate ) node in @xmath1 that was not fully explored during the observation process .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , denote the fraction of nodes and edges in @xmath2 that are present in @xmath1 . to estimate @xmath11 ,",
    "maxoutprobe uses the knowledge that real - world social and information networks tend to exhibit high clustering ( i.e. , have lots of triangles ) .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath19 be an unexplored node that is two hops away from a candidate node @xmath3 , such that @xmath19 and @xmath3 are not connected in @xmath1 ( but they may be connected in @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xmath19 forms an open wedge with @xmath3 , because @xmath19 and @xmath3 share at least one neighbor .",
    "let @xmath20 be the number of such nodes @xmath19 ; these are the nodes in @xmath1 to which @xmath3 is most likely connected .",
    "in the estimation step , maxoutprobe estimated the average clustering coefficient @xmath12 of the network , which defines the fraction of wedges that are triangles ( that is , the ratio of 3 times the number of triangles in the network to the number of length-2 paths in the network ) .",
    "given this value , maxoutprobe estimates that @xmath3 is connected to @xmath21 nodes in @xmath1 , in addition to its known neighbors in @xmath1 .",
    "s individual clustering coefficient would be more valuable here than the global clustering coefficient @xmath12 , maxoutprobe has incomplete information about @xmath3 , and thus uses @xmath12 as an approximation for the per - node clustering coefficients . ]",
    "putting this all together , maxoutprobe obtains the estimate for the number of neighbors that @xmath3 has outside of @xmath1 : @xmath22    @xmath10 and @xmath20 can be calculated exactly from @xmath1 .",
    "the challenge thus lies in estimating @xmath8 and @xmath12 , which was described in the estimation step above .",
    "maxoutprobe computes @xmath6 for all candidate nodes in @xmath1 and selects the @xmath0 candidate nodes with the highest @xmath23 values .",
