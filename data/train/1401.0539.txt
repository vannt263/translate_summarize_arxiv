    "<S> , we can exactly decompose the scalar field into left and right - moving mode as @xmath70 . </S>",

    "<S> it is curious to note that the results do not depend on the parameter @xmath66 or equally the conformal dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> the results for other local operators can be similarly understood in terms of the entangled pairs . </S>",

    "<S> if we act these states on the vacuum @xmath6 , it is obvious that they are all direct product states between left and right - moving sector </S>",

    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions *    in this letter , we proposed a series of new quantities @xmath55 which characterizes local operators in cfts . </S>",
    "<S> in short , they measure the amount quantum entanglement of an operator or more intuitively quantum mechanical degrees of freedom included in an operator .    </S>",
    "<S> they are defined as the increased amount of @xmath37-th r@xmath8nyi entanglement entropy @xmath67 at late time considering a time - evolution of an excited state obtained by acting an operator on the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we chose the subsystem @xmath4 to be a half of the total space @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> we conjectured that @xmath67 are monotonically increasing functions of time .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed various explicit examples in free massless scalar field theories in @xmath83 and @xmath1 dimension . </S>",
    "<S> they are enough to draw general conclusions for free massless scalar theories in dimension higher than two , as summarized in table i. we found that all of our results , even including two dimensional ones , can be understood in terms of quantum entanglement in finite dimensional hilbert spaces like qubits in quantum information theory .    the behavior of @xmath67 can be understood in terms of relativistic propagations of entangled pairs created by local operators . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the entropy starts increasing just when one of the entangled pair reaches the boundary @xmath50 of subsystem @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the time - evolution of entropy becomes step - functional in two dimension , while it gets a smooth function in higher dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this is because there are many directions to propagate and the arrival time at @xmath50 depends on directions in the latter .    </S>",
    "<S> note that taking the subsystem @xmath4 to be infinitely large is important to obtain a non - zero constant entropy at late time . </S>",
    "<S> our entangled pair interpretation suggests that the late time values @xmath55 do not change even if we modify the shape of @xmath4 continuously . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , they are topological quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> it is an interesting future problem to see how our results are changed in interacting cfts , where our entangled quasi - particle interpretation might be modified . </S>",
