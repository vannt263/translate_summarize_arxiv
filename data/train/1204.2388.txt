    "one of the most exciting revelations that has emerged from experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the strongly interacting nature  @xcite of the produced matter .",
    "it has properties of an almost perfect fluid characterized by a rather small value of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath2 , close to the quantum or kss bound  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation based on the measured elliptic flow @xmath3 of hadrons in terms of viscous hydrodynamics however depends sensitively on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "a lot of interest has been generated leading to quite a few estimates of the transport coefficients of both partonic  @xcite as well as hadronic  @xcite constituents of strongly interacting matter .",
    "in general , the shear viscosity coefficient is inversely proportional to the cross - section leading to strongly interacting systems being less viscous than non - interacting ones , the larger values of the viscous coefficients resulting from the possibility of momentum transport over larger distances in the latter case .",
    "the interaction cross - section thus plays the pivotal role in the relaxation of systems towards equilibrium .",
    "pions form the most important component in a hadronic system .",
    "there have been quite a few estimates of the viscosity of a pion gas .",
    "almost all these calculations have been performed in the relativistic kinetic theory approach in which a crucial input is the @xmath4 differential cross - section . in  @xcite , the scattering amplitude was estimated from the lowest order lagrangian of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite and in  @xcite a unitarized amplitude was employed for a meson gas .",
    "phenomenological amplitudes obtained from fits to phase shift data have been employed in  @xcite in view of the fact that the @xmath4 cross - section estimated from lowest order chiral perturbation theory is known to deviate from the experimental data beyond centre of mass energy of 500 mev primarily due to the @xmath0 pole which dominates the cross - section in the energy region between 500 - 1000 mev .    the spectral modification of the @xmath0 in hot and dense matter is known to play the most important role in explaining the invariant mass spectra of lepton pairs from relativistic heavy ion collisions in the region below the nominal @xmath0 mass  @xcite .",
    "the lepton pair production in this region is related by vector meson dominance to two - pion annihilation proceeding through @xmath0-exchange .",
    "moreover , medium modification of the @xmath0 spectral function incorporated in the evaluation of elliptic flow of lepton pairs of low invariant mass have been recently shown  @xcite to result in values close to those of hadrons of similar mass , ascertaining the role of @xmath3 of hadrons in describing the early stages of heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is natural to extend this scenario to the evaluation of the transport coefficients , the temperature dependence of which is particularly relevant for the electromagnetic probes which are emitted at all stages of the collision spanning a range temperatures .",

    "our intention in this work is to observe the effect of the in - medium spectral function of the @xmath0 on the shear viscosity of a pion gas .",
