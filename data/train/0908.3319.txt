    "multiparticle hadroproduction has been extremely useful along decades to understand the strong interaction dynamics @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "we explored the possibility of applying well - known techniques based on inclusive correlations and moments of multiplicity distributions to the quest for a hidden sector ( hs ) at tevatron / lhc experiments . in all fairness ,",
    "multiparticle production is still not fully understood , while our proposal is based on possible departures of @xmath2anomalous  from @xmath2standard  events .",
    "nonetheless , one might expect that , once stringent selection criteria are applied to events , distinctive features associated to a hs would become useful in the search strategy and subsequent interpretation of new phenomena in multiparticle dynamics .      in this work we focus on unparticle physics @xcite in particular , though the main ideas can be generally applied to hidden valley models @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the standard model ( sm ) is accompanied by a hs of new particles not been yet observed due to typically an energetic barrier or a weak coupling to sm particles .",
    "we will assume further that particles coming from a hs can decay back to sm particles @xcite , thereby modifying the conventional pattern of the parton cascade in multiparticle production .",
    "so far most signatures of new physics ( like jets , missing energy , high-@xmath1 leptons or photons , displaced vertices ) have been considered on the transverse plane with respect to the beam direction . in a complementary way",
    ", we advocate that a new stage of matter might also show up in _ soft _ physics of underlying events _ tagged by hard products _ , e.g. through particle ( pseudo)-rapidity correlations ( either integrated or not ) .",
    "collisions , subsequently decaying into final - state sm particles through cluster formation .",
    "the number of unparticles sources at the onset of the cascade may fluctuate , and a large ( and @xmath2continuously variable  )",
    "mass of the unparticle stuff would induce additional long - range correlations among the final - state sm particles . ]",
    "experimental results in multibody production along decades have steadily supported the tendency of produced particles to merge into correlated groups @xcite .",
    "this experimental evidence has traditionally led to the view of a two - step process for high - energy hadron collisions . the resulting multiplicity distribution is thus given by the convolution for particle emission sources ( strings , clusters / clans , fireballs ... ) with the decay / fragmenting distribution of sources .",
    "however , observable consequences could derive from a new stage of matter ( stemming from a hs ) generated at the onset of the parton shower ( see fig.1 ) leading to a 3-step scenario in hadronic collisions at very high energy .",
    "the inclusive 2-particle ( rapidity ) correlation function is defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the inelastic @xmath0 cross section and subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two considered particles event by event .",
    "@xmath5 is usually split in two terms : @xmath6 where the short - range ( sr ) part is generally assumed to be more sensitive to dynamical correlations , while @xmath7 stands for long - range ( lr ) correlations usually due to the mixing of different topologies . in this work",
    "we focus on the central rapidity region .    according to our study @xcite , the @xmath7 piece in eq.(2 )",
    "should become enhanced in a 3-step scenario wrt a standard 2-step cascade as a consequence of larger fluctuations of the number ( and mass ) of the primary sources of partons .",
    "in addition , the correlation length in the @xmath8 term should become larger because of the ( presumably ) higher mass of the intermediate hidden ( un)particle stuff . therefore longer and",
    "stronger correlations between particles can be expected from both sr and lr terms in eq.(2 ) whenever a hs appears in the cascade .",
    "nevertheless , other conventional sources of possible lr effects in multiparticle production @xcite should be properly taken into account .",

    "is deeply connected with intermittent behaviour exhibiting a power - law dependence of the multiplicity moments with the cell size @xcite .",

    "brax and peschanski @xcite proposed a better approximation than eq.([eq : beta ] ) using a lvy stable law description of multiparticle production : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the lvy index ( also known as the degree of multifractality ) which permits an estimation of the cascading rate ; @xmath36 should be in principle restricted to the interval @xmath37 ( region of stability ) with @xmath38 characterizing monofractal behaviour .",
    "instead of the law expressed in eq.([eq : levy ] ) , @xmath12 has been parametrized in the ginzburg - landau model of phase transitions as @xmath39 where @xmath40 now implies monofractality .",
    "the motivation for all these approaches in heavy - ion collisions comes from the need of a signal for quark - gluon plasma formation through , e.g. , a ( second - order ) phase - transition , since the correlation length would then diverge , and the system behave as a simple fractal @xcite .",
    "we are certainly not considering here such kind of phase - transition , but extra lr correlations from a hs leading to a similar effect on both @xmath36 and @xmath41 estimators . indeed our results shown in fig.2 are consistent with the interpretation that multiparticle production including a hs approaches monofractality ; the intermittency exponents , all @xmath10 values and @xmath36 and @xmath41 estimators turn out to be smaller in a 3-step scenario than in a 2-step cascade .",
    "let us finally note that the ( shannon ) entropy , defined for a multiplicity distribution @xmath18 as @xmath42 @xcite , might become another indicator of a hs in multiparticle production . for example , it is relevant to verify to what extent entropy is additive @xcite by checking whether @xmath43 using particles belonging to regions @xmath44 and @xmath45 well separated in rapidity space ( e.g. forward and backward hemispheres ) .",
    "intermittency and ( multi)fractality can be sensitive to a hs altering the pattern of the parton cascade in high - energy inelastic @xmath0 collisions . from our study in @xcite",
    "we conclude that longer and stronger correlations between emitted particles , and larger scaled moments in multiplicity distributions , should be expected than in a conventional qcd cascade , while the pattern of the multiparticle system approaches monofractality - or merely becomes less fractal .",
    "the challenge remains however in tagging those _ anomalous _ underlying events ( where such new phenomena would show up through soft physics ) by appropriate selection cuts , to be compared with a control sample of standard events .",
    "more work requiring prior tuning and monte carlo generation of events at lhc energies is required before drawing any conclusion about the feasibility of our proposal ."
