    "a clear understanding of dwarf galaxies and their relation to their most massive counterparts is essential for testing galaxy formation models . although the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies ( @xmath4 ) appear to contain large amounts of dark matter ( aaronson et al .",
    "1983 ; mateo 1998 ) for brighter dwarfs the situation is less clear .",
    "de rijcke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find that the dwarf companions to m31 , at @xmath5 , contain around 40 - 50% dark matter by mass within the inner two half - light radii .",
    "geha et al ( 2002 ) find that six virgo cluster dwarfs at @xmath6 do not show evidence for dark matter within an effective radius .",
    "toloba et al .",
    "( 2011 ) observe a larger sample of virgo dwarfs , and again find that they are not dark matter dominated . here",
    "we observe a sample of coma cluster dwarfs in a somewhat brighter magnitude range ( @xmath7 ) in order to understand better their internal dynamics .",
    "our goals are the extension of the faber - jackson relation ( @xmath8 ) and the fundamental plane ( fp , djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; bender et al .",
    "1992 ) relating luminosity , velocity dispersion , surface brightness , and scale length of galaxies , to the low luminosity dwarf population , providing important tools for studying formation of galaxies .",
    "for example , the precise value of the exponent of the faber - jackson relation , @xmath9 , helps to constrain galaxy formation models as it is sensitive to the effect of gas loss from self - gravitating systems ( dekel & silk 1986 ; yoshii & arimoto 1987 ) . in the case where a dark matter halo governs the galaxy dynamics ,",
    "@xmath9 is predicted to be 5.26 and @xmath10  @xmath11  @xmath12 . if , instead , the galaxies contain only baryonic matter and have roughly constant @xmath10 , a flatter relation , @xmath13 , is expected ( dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies are ideal for studying scaling relations as they provide large number of galaxies of different types , at a common distance , different environments within the cluster , and allow one to assess the interaction with the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) . since the coma cluster is one of the nearest , rich and dense clusters , it has been a popular target for studies of scaling relations among galaxies including the faber - jackson relation ( jrgensen et al .",
    "1996 ; moore et al .",
    "( 2002 : mlkc02 ) ; graham & guzmn 2003 ) .",
    "the faber - jackson relation for faint ellipticals in coma cluster has been studied by matkovi & guzmn ( 2005 : mg05 ) and cody et al .",
    "( 2009 : co09 ) , using wiyn / hydra ( multi - fiber ) spectroscopy .",
    "both mg05 and co09 find @xmath14 for dwarf ellipticals even though these studies have only 10 galaxies in common whose @xmath15 measurements differ by up to @xmath1630% for the faintest galaxies . thus , it is important to obtain high s / n data to measure velocity dispersions for dwarf galaxies at fainter magnitudes .    in this paper",
    "we use the high spectral resolution of deimos ( faber et al .",
    "2003 ) on the keck ii telescope to measure the velocity dispersions for a sample of 41 faint elliptical galaxies in the core of the coma cluster . of these galaxies ,",
    "15 are common with the samples of mg05 , co09 or both , and for the remaining 26 , these are the first velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "the current deimos measurements extend the study to luminosities in the range @xmath17 , about 1 magnitude fainter than the limit reached by the wiyn / hydra data in previous studies of coma dwarf galaxies .",
    "this paper covers mainly the observations and the technical part of the analysis .",
    "the emphasis is on the reliable estimate of the uncertainties in measuring the internal velocity dispersion of galaxies . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations , the spectroscopic setup and the data reduction .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to the measurement of radial velocities and the velocity dispersions .",
    "the error analysis is described in section 4 .",
    "the results of the analysis and the faber - jackson relation are presented and discussed in section 5 .    throughout this paper , the distance modulus of the coma cluster",
    "is considered to be @xmath18 ( carter et al . 2008 ) .",
    "[ introduction ]",
    "galaxies were selected using the photometry from adami et al .",
    "the ( b - r ) versus r colour - magnitude relation was constructed , and the red sequence identified and fitted by a linear relation .",
    "galaxies were then selected from within a region @xmath19 from this relation , with a magnitude range @xmath20 .",
    "images from the hst / acs coma treasury survey ( carter et al .",
    "2008 ) were then used to reject a very small number of galaxies with obvious spiral structure .",
    "however not all candidates fell within the footprint of the completed survey ( which was truncated owing to acs failure ) so some late - type galaxies may remain in the sample .",
    "the masks were then designed at the university of hawaii to accommodate , and as a compromise between the two programmes : the velocity dispersions programme described here , and a separate programme to measure redshifts of a sample of low surface brightness galaxies . the requirement that the spectra from different slits should not overlap , and the need for sufficient slit length to enable sky subtraction , places considerable restriction on the number of galaxies one can observe in each mask .",
    "the observations were carried out on the night of march 19@xmath21 2007 , using deimos on the keck ii telescope .",
    "the outer dimension of the rectangular deimos field is 16.7@xmath225.0 arcmin@xmath23 and all observed spectra are mapped onto 2@xmath224 mosaic of 2k@xmath224k ccds ( 2 ccds for each spectrum ) .",
    "we used 1200 g grating ( 1200 grooves / mm bk7 , gold - coated , and blazed at 7760  ) .",
    "the nominal central wavelength at the centre of the mask was 8700  , although of course the central wavelength of a given spectrum depends upon the position of that slitlet in the mask .",
    "although slitlets for the redshift survey observations were drilled at a variety of widths , all of those for the velocity dispersion project described here had widths of 0.7 arcsec .",
    "reciprocal dispersion is 0.33  / pixel , giving a spectral resolution ( fwhm ) of 1.6  , and a resolving power r@xmath165000 .",
    "this equates to an instrumental velocity width of @xmath1625 km s@xmath24 , allowing us to measure velocity dispersions down to @xmath1615 km s@xmath24 in spectra with s / n @xmath25 per pixel .",
    "the velocity dispersions of galaxies in the @xmath26 de sample are expected to range between 10 km s@xmath24 and 80 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the spectral range covered is approximately @xmath27 , although it depends upon the slit position in the mask .",
    "this wavelength range is dominated by the very deep calcium ii triplet absorption lines ( cat ) at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which depend only weakly upon metallicity , and therefore provide an ideal range over which to measure the kinematic properties of low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "a gg495 filter was used to block out the contamination from the second order blue spectrum .",
    "two masks were observed for each of two pointings , and the exposure time for each mask was in the range 6030 to 6600 seconds .",
    "a summary of these observations is presented in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "in addition , a number of potential template stars , and flux calibration stars , were observed using a 0.7 arcsec width long slit during twilight at the beginning and end of the night .",
    "wavelength calibration arcs and observations of internal flatfielding lamps were also made at the beginning of the night .",
    "we observed eleven standard stellar spectra of which only two templates were reliable for measurements in this study .",
    "the other stellar templates were excluded because they either were not g / k - type stars or were affected by noise near the ca triplet lines .",
    "the spectra of dwarf galaxies and template stars were reduced using the idl _",
    "spec2d _ pipeline developed by the deep2 galaxy redshift survey team at the university of california - berkeley for that project ( see davis et al . (",
    "2003 ) for more information ) .",
    "the pipeline performs the flat - fielding using internal quartz flats and the wavelength calibration using the arkrnexe arc lamps .",
    "the sky subtraction and the data extraction to 1d spectra are also done within the pipeline . for our purpose here ,",
    "all spectra are not flux calibrated and all partially remaining sky emission lines , particularly near the ca triplet lines , were manually removed . in this manual process , for each galaxy spectrum , we checked the wavelength of the remaining bright emission lines with the catalogues of the sky emission lines and then we replaced the verified sky emission lines with the continuum fitted underneath the spectrum .",
    "each spectrum was originally located on 2 ccds . in order to join the blue and red parts of each 1d spectrum ,",
    "the average value of the nearest 50 pixels to the ccds gap was calculated and the offset was used to construct the conjoined thorough 1d spectrum .",
    "an example of final one - dimensional spectra from the deimos in the range @xmath168300 - 9000    is shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] . in this paper",
    "all spectral s / n values are estimated per pixel ( i.e. 0.33  ) .",
    ".list of the exposures on the galaxy masks . in column 5",
    ", we give the number of slits drilled at 0.7 arcsec width , specifically for the velocity dispersion programme , excluding those drilled at larger widths for redshift measurements of low surface brightness galaxies . in column 6",
    ", we give the total number of slits per each mask . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : sig - lib ]      of six faintest galaxies from deimos sample , gmp2808 , gmp2655 , gmp3119 , gmp2780 and gmp3141 are bluer than all other sample galaxies ( see figure [ fig : csigma ] ) and have larger velocity dispersion with respect to the l-@xmath15 relation of brighter galaxies ( see figure [ tab : faber_jackson ] ) .    in order to test the effect of stellar population on measured velocity dispersions",
    ", we have repeated the @xmath15 measurement using two sets of stellar templates .",
    "first set consists of 10 f - stars with different spectral types and metallicities ( hereafter f - lib ) .",
    "second set includes both f - lib and the g / k - stars of table [ tab : ftemplates ] ( hereafter fgk - lib ) .",
    "the results of @xmath15 measurements based on set80 , fgk - lib and f - lib are compared in table [ tab : sig - lib ] .",
    "the analysis based on fgk - lib shows no changes in results except for gmp2808 which is the bluest galaxy in our sample .",
    "the measured @xmath15 of gmp3119 and gmp2808 in f - lib run is smaller than those of set80 and fgk - lib runs , however the resulting @xmath30 is higher for f - lib run .",
    "the maximum change in measured @xmath15 for all other galaxies in our sample in fgk - lib run is less than 2 @xmath31 . as a results , the measured @xmath15 values in table [ tab : results ] are independent of the stellar population except for the bluest galaxy , for which blue stellar templates should be used for @xmath15 measurement .",
    "recent gas - rich mergers in blue des may be responsible for their deviation from the fj relation .",
    "supernova driven winds can expel the luminous matter of these galaxies and shift them to the faint end of the fj diagram .",
    "moreover , the resulting starburst due to the inward gas transportation during the merger , produces the central excess light compared to the extrapolated srsic function of the galaxy outer region ( kormendy et al .",
    "the correlation between the central extra light and deviation of faint des from the scaling relations of brighter ellipticals is studied in paper ii .",
    "we have observed a sample of @xmath1650 dwarf elliptical galaxies in the core of coma cluster of which for 41 dwarfs we measured their internal velocity dispersion . for 26 galaxies",
    ", we presented the velocity dispersion for the first time .",
    "our current study extends the relation one magnitude fainter than previous studies in coma .",
    "we performed a comprehensive analysis to find the source of the uncertainties when measuring the velocity dispersion .",
    "we found that the main uncertainty may arise due to the mismatch of the stellar templates .",
    "this kind of uncertainty is less than 20% of the measured velocity dispersion for @xmath32 .",
    "the template mismatch uncertainty decreases for higher velocity dispersions and is reduced to @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "we find greater velocity dispersions when using templates with lower stellar metallicities .",
    "the effect of template mismatch is reduced with the use of multiple stellar templates and the optimization of the template weights to reproduce each sample galaxy spectrum .",
    "in addition , using the multiple stellar templates removes the dependency of the measurements on galaxy and/or templates metallicity . casting our data points and those from the literature , we get l-@xmath15 relation as @xmath35 . we noticed that fainter dwarfs show a departure from the fj relation of the brighter ellipticals which indicates that they have higher velocity dispersion than what is predicted by l-@xmath15 linear trend . in paper ii , we will present the combined study of the photometric and spectroscopic properties of this sample , focusing on the fundamental and the photometric plane of the galaxies .",
    "the authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
