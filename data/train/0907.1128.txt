    "<S> a static spherically symmetric wormhole solution for conformal gravity in vacuum is found . </S>",
    "<S> the solution possesses a single integration constant which determines the size of the neck connecting two static homogeneous universes of constant spatial curvature . </S>",
    "<S> time runs at different rates on each side of the neck , and depending on the value of the parameter , the wormhole can develop a cosmological horizon only at one side . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the wormholes correspond to the matching of different einstein spacetimes by means of improper conformal transformations .    </S>",
    "<S> if one wonders about the possibility of realizing static wormholes in vacuum in four dimensions , one knows that it should be performed within some scenario beyond general relativity ( see e.g. ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> experience gathered from extensions of general relativity in diverse dimensions@xcite@xmath0@xcite suggests that one of the key features allowing this possibility is the relaxation of the asymptotic conditions for the metric . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting theory possessing this last feature is conformal gravity ( see e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> , , ) , whose lagrangian can be written as the square of the weyl tensor , so that the action reads@xmath1 apart from being invariant under diffeomorphisms , this action is also invariant under local rescalings of the metric given by @xmath2 , and the field equations are given by the vanishing of the bach tensor , i.e. , @xmath3 it is simple to verify that any einstein space with cosmological constant is a solution of the theory in vacuum .    </S>",
    "<S> conformal gravity was intensively studied in the past and it has been shown to be renormalizable@xcite  note that the coupling @xmath4 is dimensionless . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the theory possesses fourth - order field equations for the metric , so that it has ghosts as it is generically expected . in the context </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in , regardless the theory is suitable or not as the ultimate one to describe gravity , it certainly deserves to be studied .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth pointing out that it has been recently shown that for smooth matter distributions , wormholes that do not violate the weak energy condition near the throat can exist in conformal gravity.@xcite for our purposes , it is useful mentioning that the most general spherically symmetric solution of conformal gravity ( see e.g. ref . ) </S>",
    "<S> possesses a relaxed asymptotic behavior as compared with general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the reasons explained above , the door is open to look for wormholes in vacuum within this theory .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that conformal gravity admits the following static spherically symmetric wormhole solution in vacuum , whose metric reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 stands for the line element of @xmath7 , and the range of the radial coordinate is given by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the wormhole possesses a single integration constant @xmath9 that parameterizes the radius of the neck given by @xmath10 , being located at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the wormhole connects two static homogeneous universes of constant spatial curvature with different radii , as it can be seen from the asymptotic behavior of the curvature @xmath12 and time runs at different rates at each side of the neck , since@xmath13    the case of @xmath14 is obtained from reflexion symmetry of the radial coordinate .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath15 the wormhole interpolates between static universes with spatial geometries given by hyperbolic spaces of radii @xmath16 . in the case of @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> the metric acquires a simple form , given by@xmath18 which at both sides is asymptotically locally described by @xmath19 , and it can be regarded as the groundstate \" . for @xmath20 the wormhole interpolates between flat space and a static universe with spatial geometry given by a hyperbolic space of radius @xmath21 . in the case of @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> the wormhole develops a cosmological horizon at one side of the neck , located at @xmath23 , and interpolates between an einstein universe ( @xmath24 ) for @xmath25 , and @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the causal structure of the wormhole coincides with the one of minkowski spacetime in two dimensions for @xmath26 . for @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> the wormhole shares the same causal structure with two - dimensional rindler spacetime , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a . </S>",
    "<S> + it can also be shown that the wormholes in vacuum generically correspond to the matching of different einstein spacetimes at infinity by means of improper conformal transformations . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly interesting case corresponds to @xmath27 since the wormhole is conformally related to the matching of the patch covering the region within the event horizon and infinity of the schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) metric with positive mass with two additional patches obtained from the region beyond the cosmological horizon of the schwarzschild - de sitter metric with negative mass . </S>",
    "<S> this is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b . note that in general relativity the matching of different spaces through the boundary of their corresponding conformal compactifications has no sense , since the proper distance to pass from one patch to the other diverges . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it is worth pointing out that within the context of conformal gravity this kind of matching can be performed by means of an improper conformal transformation , i.e. , a conformal transformation that vanishes at the matching surface . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the proper distance required to pass through a pair of points located at each side of the matching surface , given by @xmath28 , becomes finite .    </S>",
    "<S> it can also be seen that the wormhole ( [ spherical - wormhole - vacuum ] ) is conformally related by patches to the spherically symmetric solution of conformal gravity found in refs . and .    </S>",
    "<S> this feature also holds for the generalization of the wormholes presented here , having necks of genus greater than one . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the wormhole ( [ spherical - wormhole - vacuum ] ) with radial electric or magnetic fields can also be found , and it turns out to have electric or magnetic charge without charge \" . </S>",
    "<S> for further details we refer to ref . . </S>",
    "<S> as an ending remark , it is worth mentioning that the definition of mass in conformal gravity is a very subtle issue , which is not free of controversy.@xcite@xmath0@xcite thus , in order to have a suitable analysis of the solutions , the construction of finite conserved charges written as suitable surface integrals for conformal gravity should be addressed . </S>"
