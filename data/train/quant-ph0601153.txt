    "[ case1of4 ] shows exactly a @xmath1 configuration with dark state    @xmath19    where @xmath20 with eigenvalue 0@xcite .",
    "however , when applying the driving field @xmath18 , the dark state in resonant condition vanishes .",
    "eigenstates of the hamiltonian then become    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , satisfying the equation :    @xmath24    compared with eq .",
    "( [ dark state_lambda ] ) , state shown in eq . (",
    "[ resonant condition ] ) is the superposition of all four levels and hence is not a dark state at all .",
    "the driving field introduces state shifts and destroys the resonant dark state .",
    "however , eq . ( [ resonant condition ] ) shows some new properties .",
    "it is apparent that there is no strict dark state in this resonant condition , although in eq .",
    "( [ resonant condition ] ) some amplitude of the states can be very small .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 show that the population are transferring between two lower levels and two upper levels independently , each shares a half .",
    "so , more than eit , some applications related to population transfer is available here .",
    "however , when @xmath27 , one of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian becomes    @xmath28    with @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30    the state shown in eq .",
    "( [ dark1 ] ) is the same as in @xmath1 configuration except @xmath7 term .",
    "it has no contribution from @xmath6 and therefore is a dark state , which implies that if the atom is prepared in this state , the probability of the transition to @xmath6 is zero and subsequently , there is no absorption .",
    "thus , the medium is transparent to the probing light with detuning @xmath27 .",
    "the driving field is introduced in order to modulate the @xmath1-type eit properties . with both the coupling and driving fields detunings being zero , the detuned dark states [ eq.([dark1 ] ) ]",
    "have been derived .",
    "next , we will study the influence on this modulation of both the detuning and intensity , which is represented by rabi frequency of the driving field here .",
    "the coupling light is assumed to be resonant for the maximum @xmath1-type eit signal . in this case , it is evident that the eigenstate with zero eigenvalue of the hamiltonian [ eq.([hamiltonian 1 ] ) ] is dark for the probing light , since there is no energy exchange between the probing light and the atom .",
    "the hamiltonian reaches its zero eigenvalue when    @xmath31    and the case @xmath32 , @xmath27 is exactly the same as derived in previous section , and correspondingly , the detuned dark states are    @xmath33    according to this result , the influence of the driving field can be understood as following , while @xmath34 is assumed to be positive for convenience : ( i ) if the driving field is resonant , the detuned effects are the same on both sides of the detunings so that a symmetrical detuned eit can be drawn .",
    "( ii ) when the driving field is not resonant , or if it is far detuned with @xmath35 , then the dark state can be achieved at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "however , it is no longer symmetric because when @xmath36 , the state remains @xmath38 , which is exactly the dark state in three - level @xmath1-type eit profile ; but nearly all the population will be pumped to the level @xmath7 if @xmath37 and merely a eit signal will be available .",
    "the detuned dark state [ eq.([ds 2 ] ) ] can be understood more clearly in a dressed state picture .",
    "since the influence of the driving field is interesting here , the states dressed only by the driving field is sufficiently evident for analysis .    .",
    "apparently it can be understood as two @xmath1-type eit system with level @xmath5 shifted .",
    ", width=3 ]    according to the dressed state theory , the driving field , with no influence on @xmath4 and @xmath6 , dressed the states @xmath5 and @xmath7 into @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , and the energy shifted is exactly the same as that in eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalue zero ] ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dressed ] .",
    "thus , the detuned eit effect can , in this case , be viewed as an autler - townes splitting in an eit medium .    from the above analysis",
    ", the detuning of the driving field is set to be zero for symmetric detuned dark states .",
    "in the above analysis , no dampings are included .",
    "however , in realistic situations , dampings should be considered , especially for the case of the detuned dark state [ eqs.([dark1 ] ) or ( [ ds 2 ] ) ] derived previously , in which an excited state @xmath7 is contained . in this case , the spontaneous emission of @xmath7 will surely affect the transparency feastures .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume that there exists only radiative damping , for the collision - induced dampings can be well controlled in cold atoms , so the coherence dephasing rates are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . to see the absorption and dispersion characteristics of the probing light in such a system ,",
    "we give numerically the steady state solution of @xmath49 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ case1of4vary1 ] .",
    "it is shown that the pumping light generates one ( when @xmath50 ) or more ( when @xmath51 ) transparency windows , which is very evident when @xmath18 is large .    .",

    "[ case1of4vary1 ] , one finds that there are three transparent windows at @xmath74 detunings and resonance .",
    "as mentioned above , the dark states generate the detuned transparency and the resonant transparency can be achieved directly from eq .",
    "( [ resonant condition ] ) .",
    "since @xmath75 is relatively small , we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which makes @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ resonant condition ] ) vanish and leads to a dark - like state and therefore the transparency .",
    "the numerical solution shows that if the shift is large enough , say , about @xmath78 , all the transparency windows are separated evidently .",
    "experimental conditions often guarantee the assumption we have made to be valid .",
    "the eit element @xmath79 is important since , from which , one finds that the three lights play different roles : @xmath55 determines the transparency shift , @xmath80 determines the line shape and width , and @xmath81 is a separate term which only affects the amplitude .",
    "this property makes it easy for manipulation of the state and the coherence .    for further consideration , the dark state [ shown in eq .",
    "( [ dark1 ] ) ] is of great interest since it totally agrees with the dark state in @xmath1 configuration , which is of great importance in many respects .",
    "it should be emphasized that the driving rabi frequency @xmath18 has the impact only on the frequency shift of probing light but has nothing to do with the dark state itself .",
    "also , since the amplitude is the same between @xmath5 and @xmath7 , there is always enough population , more than half , to interact with the light .",
    "so , the detuned eit looks like a perfect shift of the @xmath1-type resonant eit scheme since even the dark states have been shifted to both sides , and the techniques , such as the adiabatic evolution , the dark state polariton and those based on the dark state , can be used here in a symmetric frequency condition .",
    "however , from the above analysis , one may find out that the absorption at @xmath83 is not zero .",
    "this is because only @xmath6 is dark , while @xmath7 , which keeps damping out , is still populated . if the dampings are included , the states expressed in eq .",

    "the influence of @xmath82 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ double_lambda ] and [ absoptionshifted ] , which show that the absorption is proportional to @xmath82 when @xmath82 is small .     and @xmath82 . here , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "both the coupling and driving lights are resonant.,width=325 ]    from the above analysis , it is clear that the damping rate from @xmath7,i.e . ,",
    "@xmath82 , plays an important role .",
    "if @xmath82 is approximately equal to @xmath90 , the expressions have been given already .",
    "if @xmath82 is small compared to @xmath90 , as required experimentally , the imaginary part of @xmath49 can be derived as    @xmath91=\\frac{\\zeta \\,{\\kappa } ^2\\,{g_a } }    { 4\\,{\\kappa } ^2 + { \\left (   { \\kappa } ^2",

    "it is apparent that when the probing light is resonant , the absorption is independent of @xmath82 .",
    "but when the probing light is detuned to be around @xmath99 , the absorption characteristics strongly depends on @xmath82 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the level @xmath100 should not be too stable , as illustrated in fig.[specialplot.eps ] . in the limit @xmath101",
    ", the relationship between the absorption and @xmath102 would undergo great changes ( fig .",
    "[ specialplot.eps ] ) : the absorption at all frequencies has been reduced to less than two percent of that at @xmath103 . that is to say , when one probing light injects into this system , the system is almost transparent , so the difference between transparency window and other frequencies can be neglected . in this sense ,",
    "when level @xmath100 is too stable , the windows we create would collapse .",
    "moreover , the overall property of absorption curve ( inset of fig . [ specialplot.eps ] ) is also significantly changed .    , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",

    "we find that when @xmath107 is reduced to @xmath108 , the transparency window has collapsed . ]",
    "in conclusion , we apply a driving optical field to the @xmath1 configuration and destroy the dark state in resonant condition",
    ". however , at @xmath74 detunings of the probing field , the dark states are rebuilt with almost complete fidelity .",
    "the influences of the three lights and destructive effects by dampings are discussed .    for experimental realization ,",
    "a closed four - level n - type atom system is required .",
    "one of this kind of atom configurations is available in the d2 line of @xmath109cs .",
    "the four levels can be chosen , according to respective dipole moments , as : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 . in this configuration ,",
    "the four levels compose a closed system and all the damping rates are equal ( @xmath114 ) . of course",
