    "researchers in neuroscience often want to understand how the structure of the central nervous system of animals relates to the function of the system both in healthy and diseased individuals , and much effort has been spent trying to model coupled neurons as networks of nonlinearly interacting cells ( see e.g. @xcite ) and emergent dynamical properties of the network are clearly important for an understanding of neural function from basic signal processing to high - level cognition ; for example @xcite suggest that the `` dynome '' of possible states of the network is just as critical as the physical `` connectome '' of connections between neurons and neural assemblies .",
    "in addition to the physical network of coupled cells , the possible transient dynamical states of the system may usefully be thought to form a network _ in phase space _ of some type .",
    "heteroclinic network _ is a finite set of dynamical states connected by trajectories ( defined more precisely below ) .",
    "this idea has been developed in a number of models inspired by neural systems @xcite ; see also winnerless competition dynamics @xcite , stable heteroclinic channels @xcite , and networks of unstable attractors @xcite",
    ". if there are no `` direct connections '' between states , there may be _ excitable connections _ where a certain amplitude of a on - off perturbation at a state is needed for a transition from one state to another , giving rise to an _ excitable network _",
    "( also defined below ) whose structure will typically depend on the amplitude of perturbation used .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we proposed two constructions to show how arbitrary graphs may be embedded or _ realised _ as a heteroclinic network in the sense that there is a one - to - one mapping between vertices and edges of the graph and dynamical states . that paper presents a `` simplex network '' and a `` cylinder network '' of coupled cells that allows one to realise any finite directed graph that is one - cycle free into phase space as a heteroclinic network .",
    "the vertices of the graph correspond to equilibria that are saddles in phase space and the edges of the graph correspond to connecting ( heteroclinic ) orbits in phase space .",
    "the constructions in  @xcite require several different cell types ; field @xcite has recently shown that it is possible to do this even if one restricts to just one cell type .",
    "this paper aims to present an explicit construction to realize arbitrary graphs in phase space as either heteroclinic or excitable networks .",
    "not only this , we identify a bifurcation from a heteroclinic network to an excitable network of the same topology on changing a single parameter in the governing equations . in the former case",
    "the vertices are saddle equilibria and the connections are heteroclinic . in the latter case",
    "the vertices correspond to stable equilibria in the network that are sensitive to perturbations in directions corresponding to the edges in the graph .",
    "the network construction uses two cell types , where there is strong inhibition between cells of one type and strong excitation of this cell type by the second cell type , reminiscent of neuronal systems .",
    "we structure the paper as follows : after defining heteroclinic and excitable networks in phase space we give a simple motivating example ( given in equation  ( [ eq : c3system ] ) ) of a system that realises a cyclic graph between three nodes as either a heteroclinic or an excitable network , depending on values of the parameters in the equations . in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce an explicit description of a coupled cell model ( given in equation  ( [ eq : realiseode ] ) ) that is parameterised by a number of constants . the first main result ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : realisehet ] , shows that an arbitrary finite directed network can be robustly realised as a heteroclinic network in the phase space of this coupled cell system .",
    "similarly , the second main result , theorem  [ thm : realiseexc ] , shows that an arbitrary finite directed network can be robustly realised as an excitable network for amplitude @xmath2 in the phase space of this coupled cell system .",
    "the minimum amplitude is related to the distance of a parameter from a bifurcation point where the saddles in the heteroclinic network are stabilized . in particular , the @xmath2 may be made as small as desired by choosing parameters appropriately .",
    "we give some numerical examples in section  [ sec : examples ] that realise the kirk ",
    "silber network @xcite of competition between two cycles using ( [ eq : realiseode ] ) in the two different ways outlined in section  [ sec : model ] . in the presence of noise",
    ", we note that typical trajectories explore either cycle in a random manner . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss some implications of the study , including generalizations that give networks in phase space where there may be a mixture of heteroclinic and excitable connections , and where the excitable connections may have various thresholds .",

    "note that this definition of heteroclinic network is weaker than that used in most of the literature , e.g.  @xcite , in the following ways : ( a ) we do not require any chain recurrence or even connectedness of the network ; for example , we do not exclude the possibility that the system is of gradient type ; ( b ) we do not require that the entire unstable set is contained in the network ; ( c ) we do not require that the equilibria are hyperbolic , although in typical cases the equilibria of heteroclinic networks are saddles ( if there are incoming and outgoing heteroclinic connections at that equilibria ) , and the equilibria of proper excitable networks are sinks .",

    "if @xmath47 has connections to @xmath46 and @xmath45 via @xmath68 and @xmath224 then for large enough @xmath202 , almost every trajectory on @xmath225 is a connection to one of @xmath226 or @xmath45 .",

    "to in the heteroclinic case , we again note that the residence times near @xmath46 appear to be smaller than near the other equilibria due to the presence of two escape routes .",
    "we also note that the shape of the distributions of escape times in the heteroclinic and excitable cases appears to be different .",
    "in particular , very long residence times are more likely in the excitable case than in the heteroclinic case ( the distribution has a fatter tail ) .",
    "this can be seen in comparison of figure  [ fig : ks - ts](e ) and ( f ) ; although the timescales are different ( due to the different parameters ) , we have scaled the @xmath8-axes so that the mean residence times appear at the same position in each figure ( these are approximately @xmath262 and @xmath263 respectively ) , and the fatter tail in ( f ) can be clearly seen , along with a much more peaked distribution in ( e ) .",
    "in contrast to the case for the heteroclinic network , we expect the residence times for the excitable network will be governed by a kramers - type of escape process giving rise an exponential tail in the residence times .",
    "this and other statistical properties of switching and residence times near heteroclinic and excitable networks are being investigated for a forthcoming work  @xcite .",
    "the main results of the paper are the constructive model ( [ eq : realiseode ] ) and theorems  [ thm : realisehet ] and [ thm : realiseexc ] that give open sets of parameter values where one can robustly realize an arbitrary directed graph as an attracting heteroclinic network or an excitable network in phase space .",
    "although the noise - free dynamics of the network is to some extent trivial ( there will be slowing - down heteroclinic dynamics visiting a sequence of equilibria that depends on the initial condition for the heteroclinic network , or , the trajectory will remain at the first stable equilibrium for the excitable network ) the dynamics of the networks become much more interesting in the presence of noise .",
    "it is known that addition of low noise to an attracting heteroclinic network can lead to random switching around a heteroclinic network in a temporally fairly regular manner @xcite ; similarly , addition of noise to an excitable network leads also to random switching around an excitable network .",
    "we will explore elsewhere the switching probabilities and residence times near equilibria as a function of the noise strengths and parameter values @xcite .",
    "similarly , addition of very small inputs in the form of impulses to the @xmath122 variables allows one to control transitions between states in a way that depend on inputs and current state - and so perform finite state computing in the system ( [ eq : realiseode ] ) in a manner similar to @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to explore the computational potential of this network .",
    "our construction is `` wasteful '' in the sense that only one cell will be active at any time ; the encoding of states is very sparse compared to what nervous systems presumably achieve .",
    "it will be a challenge to see whether this construction can be adapted to achieve more dense encoding without losing the high level of control of the dynamics .",
    "our concept of an excitable network ( in phase space ) needs to be distinguished from the more general concept of a network of excitable systems .",
    "a network of the latter type may or may not realise the former as a network in phase space , depending the nature and strength of the coupling .",
    "for example , networks of excitable systems ( see for example @xcite ) may have many excitable states corresponding to various combinations of cells being active .",
    "the boundary between heteroclinic and excitable network dynamics for is on the line @xmath264 and corresponds to a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation of the equilibria @xmath265 within the invariant subspace @xmath105 for each outgoing direction @xmath266 from @xmath265 . by considering @xmath267 and @xmath268 ( i.e. @xmath121 , @xmath207 depending on @xmath222 ) one can clearly design networks using ( [ eq : realiseode ] ) that mix heteroclinic and excitable connections with thresholds @xmath269 that may vary from one connection to another .",
    "the presence of microscopic noise in the heteroclinic network will result in trajectories wandering around the embedded graph with random choice of outgoing edges at each node . for @xmath121 and @xmath207 independent of @xmath42 and low amplitude noise",
    ", this will appear to be a one - step markov process with a distribution of residence times .",
    "however , varying @xmath270 and @xmath271 in the heteroclinic network case introduces the possibility of `` lift - off '' and `` memory '' of the system trajectories in ( [ eq : realiseode ] ) as discussed for a related system in @xcite .",
    "if the transition past a node is sufficiently fast compared to previous nodes the transition probabilities between nodes may depend not just on the current state but on previously visited states ; this will be dependent on the eigenvalues of the equilibria @xmath265 .",
    "this gives the possibility of designing a system with more complex time correlations than a one - step markov process .",
