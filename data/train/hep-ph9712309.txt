    "the production of hard photons in hadronic processes is an important testing ground for qcd .",
    "since the photon does not take part in the strong interaction , it is a direct probe of the hard scattering process .",
    "direct photon production in @xmath5 @xcite and in @xmath6 collisions @xcite provides a means to determine the strong coupling constant @xmath7 and has been used to extract information on the parton distributions , in particular the gluon density in the proton @xcite . in @xmath8 annihilation @xcite , measurements of photon radiation in hadronic @xmath9 decays at lep1 have provided important independent information on the electroweak couplings of _ up _ and _ down _ quarks to the @xmath9 boson @xcite .",
    "moreover , final states containing a photon are an important background for many searches for new physics and a good knowledge of the standard model predictions for direct photon production is therefore required .    at hera ,",
    "radiative deep inelastic scattering , @xmath10 , with photons collinear to the incoming electron has been used to obtain a measurement of the structure function @xmath11 at low values of the momentum transfer @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "also the first observation of hard non - collinear photons at @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _  in photoproduction has been reported recently @xcite . with increasing luminosity this measurement",
    "is expected to contribute information on the parton content of the photon and the proton . by contrast , direct photon production at large @xmath12 would be sensitive to the parton distributions in the proton only",
    ". the information obtained this way would be complementary to the @xmath11 measurement from inclusive deep inelastic scattering , since _ up _ and _ down _ quarks contribute with different weights .",
    "typical cross sections for the production of hard photons in deep inelastic scattering with @xmath14 gev@xmath15 are of the order of 10 pb . with a luminosity of 50 pb@xmath16 one",
    "thus expects statistical uncertainties of the order of 5% and a measurement of differential cross sections seems feasible .    whereas next - to - leading order calculations for direct photon production are available for photoproduction @xcite , @xmath6 collisions @xcite , as well as for @xmath8 annihilation @xcite , a corresponding calculation for deep inelastic @xmath17 scattering was still missing . in this work",
    "we study the @xmath0 corrections to the process @xmath18 at large @xmath12 .",
    "since hard photon production is a process of relative order @xmath19 with respect to the total deep inelastic scattering cross section , we expect sizable event rates only at moderately large @xmath12 and restrict ourselves therefore to pure photon exchange , _ i.e. _  @xmath9-exchange contributions are neglected .",
    "the calculations will be organized in such a way that the hadronic final state can be separated into  and  topologies ( the remnant being counted as",
    " @xmath20 \" jet , as usual ) .",
    "our approach is thus analogous to that in calculations of @xmath21- and @xmath22-jet cross sections in deep inelastic scattering where a gluon is replaced by a photon @xcite .",
    "events originate through the emission or absorption of a gluon . therefore the ratio of  and  events is sensitive to the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath7 and to the gluon distribution .",
    "in addition to perturbative direct production , photons are also produced through the ` fragmentation ' of a hadronic jet into a single photon carrying a large fraction of the jet energy @xcite .",
    "this long - distance process is described in terms of the quark - to - photon and gluon - to - photon fragmentation functions .",
    "the necessity for taking into account non - perturbative contributions is signaled by the presence of singularities showing up in a perturbative calculation .",
    "these singularities are related to collinear photon - quark configurations .",
    "the factorization theorem of qcd guarantees that all singularities can be absorbed into well - defined universal parton - to - photon fragmentation functions , the remainder being calculable in perturbation theory .    in practice ,",
    "a measurement of direct photon production is feasible only when isolation conditions are imposed on the observed photon in order to reduce various hadronic backgrounds , in particular from two - photon decays of @xmath23 .",
    "the contribution from non - perturbative parton - to - photon fragmentation , being related to collinear photon emission from partons , can be reduced by isolation requirements , but is not completely removed .",
    "again , in a perturbative calculation , this is related to the presence of singularities .",
    "in fact , if one tries to model the experimental isolation conditions by imposing cutoffs on parton - level jets , one can not exclude contributions due to soft quarks having emitted a hard collinear photon ; the soft quark may appear only as part of a parton - level jet , but not as a separate , observable jet which can enter the isolation conditions - jet , where already at leading order photon - jet isolation does not remove the photon - quark collinear singularity @xcite .",
    "a next - to - leading order calculation @xcite shows features typical for a next - to - next - to - leading order calculation .",
    "measurements of the quark - to - photon fragmentation function in @xmath24-jet had been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and were described in refs .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "the implementation of photon isolation is particularly non - trivial in a calculation including @xmath0 contributions since the isolation conditions affect the available phase space for gluon emission @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the parton - to - photon fragmentation functions may have to be modified for isolated photon production and higher - order corrections may turn out to be large and to require their resummation .    in the present work we adopt a simpler approach where the fragmentation contributions are ignored completely .",
    "the photon - quark collinear singularities then have to be removed by explicit parton - level cutoffs .",
    "the dependence of the final results on these cutoffs ( discussed in section 4 below ) will indicate to what extent the quark - to - photon fragmentation function would contribute in a more systematic treatment .",
    "in leading order ( lo ) , the production of photons in deep inelastic electron ( positron ) proton scattering is described by the quark ( antiquark ) subprocess @xmath25 where we have given the definition of the particle momenta in parentheses .",
    "the momentum of the incoming quark is a fraction of the proton momentum @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "the proton remnant @xmath28 carries the momentum @xmath29 and hadronizes into the remnant jet so that the process ( [ loprocess ] ) gives rise to  final states .",
    "the momentum of the hadronic final state , _",
    "i.e. _  the @xmath30-jet system , is @xmath31 and its invariant mass @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 we will use the well - known kinematic variables for deep inelastic scattering @xmath34 determined by the momentum of the scattered lepton . because of the presence of the photon in the final state , large @xmath12 does not guarantee large @xmath32 and we will have to require explicitly @xmath35 in order to stay in the deep inelastic regime where a perturbative treatment can be expected to work .",
    "apart from this , we will also apply cuts on the variables @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath12 since we ask for an observable scattered electron .",
    "these latter cuts remove direct photon production in photoproduction .",
    "both leptons and quarks emit photons .",
    "the subset of feynman diagrams where the photon is emitted from the lepton (  leptonic radiation \" ) is gauge invariant and can be treated separately .",
    "similarly , the feynman diagrams with a photon emitted from the quark line is called  quarkonic radiation \" .",
    "there is also a contribution from the interference of these two parts . for tests of qcd",
    "the interest is in those contributions where the photon is emitted from quarks and leptonic radiation is viewed as a background .",
    "radiative deep inelastic scattering appears as a contribution to qed radiative corrections ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in this case",
    "the emitted photon remains undetected and singularities due to soft and collinear photons have to be canceled by taking into account virtual @xmath38 corrections to non - radiative scattering @xmath39 .",
    "here we are interested in events with an observable photon , _",
    "i.e. _  we restrict ourselves to the case where the energy of the photon @xmath40 is sufficiently large , @xmath41 also , the photon should be spatially separated from all other particles : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the angle between the momenta of the photon and particle @xmath44 ( @xmath45 for the leading - order process ( [ loprocess ] ) and similarly for the next - to - leading order processes specified in section 3 below ) . in particular ,",
    "the photon is not allowed to be emitted close to the beams : @xmath46 these cuts remove all photonic infrared and collinear singularities . instead of using the angle @xmath43 , photon separation from final state particles",
    "can also be imposed by cuts on the invariant masses @xmath47 or , normalized to the invariant mass of the hadronic final state , @xmath48 the condition @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is more comfortable for the analytic calculation , but less suited to experimental requirements .",
    "since we will perform the phase space integration with the help of monte carlo techniques , we are not restricted to one specific choice of isolation criteria , but we can apply a combination of the above cuts as will be described below .    at lowest order ,",
    "each parton is identified with a jet and photon - parton isolation corresponds to the isolation of the photon from an observable jet . with isolation cuts ,",
    "parton - to - photon fragmentation does not contribute at this order .",
    "at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , processes with an additional gluon , either emitted into the final state or as incoming parton , have to be taken into account : @xmath51 @xmath52 where the definition of momenta is again shown in parentheses ( see fig .  [ feynman ] ) .",
    "in addition , virtual corrections ( one - loop diagrams at @xmath0 ) to the process ( [ loprocess ] ) have to be included .",

    "similarly , photon isolation can be imposed with the help of cuts on the scaled invariant masses .    in the phase space region",

    "therefore , @xmath71 can not be identified with the @xmath37-cut of a jet algorithm applied in an experimental analysis . there , due to experimental restrictions , @xmath37 can not be reduced to values below @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , a fixed - order calculation may give unphysical , _",

    "i.e. _  to recombine 2 partons in the parton - level @xmath21-jet events according to a jet algorithm using @xmath37-cuts @xmath66 for the separation of jet pairs ( similarly : @xmath76 for the separation of a jet and a photon ) with values as appropriate for the given experimental situation .",
    "the calculation thus proceeds through two subsequent steps : first , phase space slicing is applied with a small @xmath37-cut @xmath71 of the order of @xmath77 to accomplish the cancellation of singularities .",
    "this step relies on analytic calculations .",
    "secondly , a jet algorithm is applied with experimentally realizable , _ i.e. _  large enough values @xmath66 and @xmath76 of the order of @xmath78 .",
    "the second step is performed during the monte carlo integration .",

    "note that the denominator @xmath86 introduced by partial fractioning can become zero only if both @xmath87 and @xmath88 at the same time ; since configurations where all three partons 3 , 4 , and 6 are collinear with each other are excluded by the cut on @xmath32 , this is possible only for @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , for a contribution containing the pole factor @xmath90 , we can separate the phase space into three regions :    * @xmath91 .",
    "this region contains the infrared singularity at @xmath92 , as well as the collinear singularity at @xmath87 , @xmath93 and leads to singular contributions , _",

    "it is non - negligible in particular for terms related to isr singularities .",
    "the integrals needed for the singular contributions are written in a lorentz - invariant form as tensor integrals which can be reduced to a few basic scalar integrals with the help of analytic programs like mathematica or form .",
    "more details are given in @xcite .",
    "the remaining phase space integrations are performed with the help of monte carlo techniques .",
    "the three contributions s , r , and f are treated separately , each with appropriate mappings of the respective integration variables to improve the numerical stability of the calculation .    as discussed in the introduction , in the present work we do not factorize and subtract those photon - parton collinear singularities which have to be absorbed into parton - to - photon fragmentation functions .",
    "instead , we remove all singular contributions by keeping isolation cuts at the parton level . as stated in the introduction , care has to be taken that the isolation criteria do not restrict the phase space for gluon emission since this would destroy the cancellation of singular contributions .",
    "therefore , in the first step of the calculation described above , we require the photon to be isolated from the quark ( antiquark ) by the cut @xmath100 with @xmath101 for @xmath79 and @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "the cut is not applied to photon - gluon pairs which is possible since gluons do not emit photons and there is no singularity related to @xmath104 .",
    "this definition of photon isolation at the parton level introduces an unphysical parameter ( @xmath105 ) . the sensitivity to @xmath105",
    "can be reduced by applying , in the second step of the calculation , photon isolation with respect to jets described by cutoff parameters which can be used in the same way in the experimental analysis . in order to have some freedom",
    "when modeling these physical isolation criteria we choose a small value for @xmath105 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath105 will be discussed below .",
    "the events generated during monte carlo integration are @xmath112 , @xmath113 or @xmath114 events .",
    "a simple event analysis is applied to obtain  and  event samples .",
    "the event analysis consists of two parts : the first part serves to identify the number of jets according to a conventional jet algorithm ; the second part treats photon isolation . for simplicity",
    "we choose a jet definition using the normalized invariant masses @xmath72 .",
    "since for small @xmath115 the momentum of the remnant and thus @xmath116 can be large even for partons with small transverse momentum , we first remove low-@xmath117 partons before recombining partons to jets .",
    "explicitly we apply the following conditions :    * a final state parton ( quark or gluon ) is recombined with the remnant if its transverse momentum is below a cutoff : @xmath118 * two partons are recombined into one jet if @xmath119 and all quarks , antiquarks and gluons as well as the proton remnant are taken into account when forming jets .",
    "if several pairs of partons have @xmath72 below @xmath66 , the pair with the smallest @xmath72 is recombined first .",
    "several prescriptions for the recombination are possible : the energy and 3-momentum of a jet @xmath120 obtained from pairing partons @xmath44 and @xmath121 can be obtained by @xmath122 for example in the e - scheme one chooses @xmath123 ; in the p - scheme one has @xmath124 , @xmath125 instead .",
    "since the present calculation is of first order in @xmath7 , the recombination has not to be iterated .",
    "however , the different recombination prescriptions become relevant when photon isolation with respect to jets is imposed . in addition , the cut on low-@xmath126 partons or parton - pairs eq .",
    "( [ ptmincut ] ) is affected if a recombination prescription with @xmath127 is used .",
    "our numerical results will be given for the p - scheme .",
    "* finally , an event is accepted only if the photon is separated from the jets or if the photon is accompanied by hadronic energy less than a specified amount , _",
    "i.e. _  we exclude events with @xmath128 where @xmath121 denotes any jet ( _ i.e. _ , parton or pair of partons ) remaining after steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the event analysis .",
