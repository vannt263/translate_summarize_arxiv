    "driven by the need to understand the pion substructure in terms of its quark ( and gluon ) degrees of freedom , an impressive progress has been achieved in the last few years both from the perturbative side @xcite , as well as from the point of view of a deeper insight into the underlying nonperturbative dynamics @xcite .",
    "in addition , the improved quality of recent @xcite and planned experiments @xcite in conjunction with more sophisticated data - processing techniques @xcite may soon enable a cleaner comparison between qcd theory and data .",
    "this talk assesses these issues on the basis of a recent analysis @xcite of the ( spacelike ) pion s electromagnetic form factor under the imposition of analyticity of the running strong coupling and its powers  as far as its factorized part is concerned  including the soft contribution via local duality .",
    "the discussion focuses on the phenomenological exploitation of these theoretical concepts , sketching how analytic perturbation theory ( apt)fixed - order and resummed  can significantly improve the quality of perturbatively calculable hadronic quantities .",
    "nonperturbative input enters via the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) @xcite , derived from nonlocal qcd sum rules .",
    "to start reasoning about `` analytization '' procedures , we have to make some remarks about the origin of the concept of the analytic coupling . already used in inclusive reactions @xcite , the framework of apt @xcite has evolved in parallel with other dispersive techniques @xcite to tame the landau singularity",
    ". a broader framework of analytization in exclusive qcd processes @xcite has permitted to refine  and in some sense to complexify  progressively the related concepts extending the apt formalism of @xcite to hadronic observables with more than one scheme scales ( like @xmath2 at nlo ) , and including erbl  evolution @xcite , and also sudakov resummation pertaining to both logarithms and power corrections . the two main objectives of this framework are ( i ) the augmentation of exclusive amplitudes with ir protection against the landau ghost and ( ii ) the improvement of perturbative qcd calculations by rendering them insensitive to the choice of the renormalization scheme and scale adopted .",
    "this allows to obtain predictions with significantly reduced theoretical bias , permitting this way a much cleaner comparison with experimental data .",

    "note that these expressions take into account the nlo evolution of the pion distribution amplitude and hence contain diagonal ( d ) as well as ( the nlo term ) non - diagonal ( nd ) components .",
    "the effects of the lo evolution are crucial @xcite , while those of the nlo are relatively of less importance .",
    "this allows us to set @xcite : @xmath7 for a detailed exposition of this material , see @xcite .     using apt and the bms  pion da @xcite in conjunction with the `` naive analytic '' ( top ) and `` maximally analytic '' ( bottom ) procedures @xcite : @xmath8 scheme and @xmath9 ( dashed line ) ; blm  ( dotted line ) ; @xmath10 ( solid line ) ; @xmath11-scheme ( dash - dotted line ) .",

    "[ fig : ff - naiv - max ] ) , the soft nonfactorizable contribution was incorporated via local duality ( ld ) and the ward identity at @xmath1 was implemented by a power - behaved pre - factor in order to ensure that each of these two contributions was evaluated in its own momentum region of validity .",
    "hence , we have @xmath24 with @xmath25 ^ 2\\ !         f_{\\pi}^{\\rm",
    "fact}(q^2;\\mu_{\\rm r}^{2 } ) \\label{eq : fpi - mod}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath26  gev@xmath27 ( for more details , see @xcite ) .     calculated with the `` maximally analytic '' procedure and the pion das derived with nonlocal qcd sum rules @xcite ( shaded strip ) .",
    "the broken lines denote the region accessible to the asymptotic pion da .",
    "the experimental data are taken from ( diamonds ) and @xcite ( triangles ) .",
    "[ fig : ff - strip ] ]    the main phenomenological upshot of the presented analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff - strip ] .",
    "it is interesting to observe from this figure that the theoretical error bounds ( shaded strip ) induced by the nonperturbative determination of the pion da within the nonlocal qcd sum - rules picture are much smaller than those of the current high - momentum experimental data .",
    "this situation may , however , dramatically improve in a couple of years when the approved upgrade of cebaf@jlab to an energy of @xmath28  gev will start delivering high - precision data up to momentum transfers of about @xmath29  gev@xmath30 ( see second entry in @xcite ) .",
    "another striking observation from this figure is that the form - factor predictions obtained with the double - humped bms  pion da are only slightly larger than those following from the single - peaked asymptotic da ( area within the two broken lines ) .",
    "hence , it becomes evident that what counts for the form factor is not the central region of longitudinal momenta around @xmath31 of the pion da , but its endpoint regions @xmath32 @xcite , as pointed out before in @xcite .",
    "if the endpoint region is suppressed , then the form - factor prediction does not get artificial enhancement that may jeopardize the perturbative treatment .",
    "this suppression is controlled by the nonlocality of the scalar quark condensate , parameterized by the average quark virtuality @xmath33 in the vacuum , with theoretical estimates in the range @xmath34 @xcite and a preferable value of @xmath35  gev@xmath30 extracted in @xcite from the cleo data .    ]",
    "another means to suppress the endpoint region is provided by the sudakov form factor @xcite to which we now turn our attention .",
    "sudakov resummation in conjunction with `` naive analytization '' was first considered in @xcite in connection with the asymptotic pion da and fig .",
    "[ fig : ffpi - sud ] shows the prediction for the form factor based on a nlo calculation similar to that in @xcite .",
    "i have discussed a cutting - edge analysis @xcite of the electromagnetic pion form factor , representing a confluence of advantages in qcd , ranging from non - power series fixed - order @xcite and resummed analytic perturbation theory @xcite to an improved cleo data processing @xcite and to nonperturbative modelling of the pion distribution amplitude via nonlocal condensates @xcite .",
    "it appears that the principle of maximal analytization @xcite of hadronic observables in conjunction with qcd perturbation theory helps to offset the renormalization - scheme and scale - setting dependence ",
    "unavoidable in the conventional power - series perturbative expansion  already at nlo .",
    "the crucial observation on the nonperturbative side @xcite is that the cleo @xcite and the cello @xcite data on the pion - photon transition and also the jlab  data @xcite on the pion s electromagnetic form factor can be best described by the doubly peaked but endpoint - suppressed bms  pion distribution amplitude @xcite with all other known model distribution amplitudes being relatively disfavored by one or the other set of experimental data at least at the @xmath36 level @xcite .",
    "i am confident that the analytic perturbative approach presented here  to be seen in conjunction with several other applications discussed elsewhere @xcite  is a key step towards achieving a better control over perturbative expansions , in particular , in the low @xmath37 domain  especially after integrating more accurately resummation techniques under ( maximal ) analytization .",
