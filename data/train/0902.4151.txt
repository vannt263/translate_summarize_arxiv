    "noise is usually considered as an unwanted characteristics of electronic circuits .",
    "sometimes , however , studying electronic noise gives important information about physical systems .",
    "in particular , noise in small junctions is affected by the fermionic statistics of electrons and is an essential part of quantum mesoscopic transport ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "even more information about the quantum behavior of charge carriers is encoded in the full probability distribution of the transferred charge : a concept known as full counting statistics @xcite .",
    "the full counting statistics of electrons is most studied for the simplest model of non - interacting fermions in various setups . in this model , the general expression for the probability distribution of the transferred charge is given by an elegant determinant formula of levitov and lesovik @xcite .",
    "this formula expresses the generating function for the probability distribution as a certain functional determinant involving the single - particle scattering matrix .",
    "an exact calculation of this functional determinant may be performed in several special setups of the charge transfer @xcite , and until recently most of the results on the full counting statistics in this model concentrated on studying such exactly solvable cases .    however in the recent years a progress has been made in understanding general properties of charge transfer encoded in the determinant formula .",
    "namely , it has been shown that , in the case of a contact with two external leads , the total electronic transfer is given by a superposition of uncorrelated elementary charge transfers of single electrons . in each of such single - electron events ,",
    "one electron has a certain probability @xmath0 to pass through the contact ( thereby transferring one quantum of charge ) and the probability @xmath1 to reflect ( resulting in no charge transfer ) .",
    "this decomposition into elementary charge - transfer events ( dubbed `` generalized binomial '' statistics @xcite ) has been shown under various assumptions : at zero temperature for a charge transfer driven by a time - dependent bias voltage @xcite , at zero temperature for the adiabatic - pumping problem @xcite , and in the wave - packet formalism ( a finite number of wave packets with a momentum - dependent scattering ) @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to lift the assumptions made in those previous works and to show that the generalized binomial statistics is universally valid for any charge - transfer problem involving non - interacting fermions : at any temperature and for any time- and energy - dependent scatterer .",
    "a necessary condition remains that the initial state does not involve any entanglement between the leads or between different charge sectors in each lead .",
    "it may be therefore practical to describe the statistics for noninteracting fermions by the distribution @xmath2 of the effective transparencies of the elementary charge transfers , instead of the probabilities of the total transfer . to illustrate this construction",
    ", we list several known examples where the distribution @xmath2 is exactly known .",
    "finally , to illustrate the importance of the non - interacting assumption , we also present several examples of _ interacting _ systems where the full counting statistics is _ not _ generalized binomial . in those cases",
    ", we may interpret the effect of interaction as a shift of the transparencies @xmath0 to the complex plane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , to fix the notation , we briefly review the derivation of the levitov ",
    "lesovik determinant formula in section  [ sec : detfcs ] . in section  [ sec : fcszeros ] we obtain our main result : a decomposition of an arbitrary charge transfer process into independent tunneling events . in sections",
    "[ sec : fcsnonint ] and [ sec : fcsint ] , we illustrate our construction with several noninteracting and interacting examples , respectively .",
    "finally , we conclude with section  [ sec : conclusion ] , where we discuss possible generalizations and applications of our results .",
    "some technical details are relegated to appendices a , b , c.",
    "in this section we briefly review some known results from the theory of full counting statistics for non - interacting fermions ( mainly following the method of ref .  ) .",
    "we also introduce the notation and specify the assumptions used in the subsequent sections .",
    "a typical full - counting - statistics problem involves determining the probabilities of a given charge transfer through the junction . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the case of a junction with two leads , and therefore the definitions in this section will be written for a two - lead junction , even though they admit a natural generalization to a many - lead situation @xcite . in the case of two leads ,",
    "the charge transfer is characterized by one number @xmath3 : an integer number of electrons moved from the left to the right lead ( or @xmath4 electrons from the right to the left lead ) .",
    "the ingredients of the problem are : ( i ) the initial density matrix of the system @xmath5 and ( ii ) the unitary evolution operator @xmath6 ( over the time when the measurement is performed ) . to formally define the transferred charge @xmath3 , we also need ( iii ) an operator @xmath7 which counts the particles in one of the leads ( say , the right lead ) .",
    "then one easily sees that the probabilities of a given charge transfer @xmath3 can be found from the generating function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an auxiliary variable and the trace is taken in the many - body fock space ( for technical reasons , it is convenient to explicitly include the normalization of the density matrix ) . for a good definition of charge transfer _ probabilities _ , one needs to further assume that different charge sectors are not entangled , i.e. , that @xmath5 commutes with @xmath7 . under this assumption",
    "one finds that thus defined @xmath10 may indeed be interpreted as a generating function @xmath11 for some probabilities @xmath12 .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath10 ( or , equivalently , the quantization of @xmath3 ) follows from the fact that the spectrum of @xmath7 is integer",
    ". it will therefore be convenient for our purposes to treat @xmath10 as a function of the complex variable @xmath13 then ( [ fcs ] ) becomes the laurent series of the complex function @xmath14 .",
    "the fourier components of @xmath10 ( the coefficients of the laurent series ) define the probabilities @xmath15 , while the derivatives at @xmath16 give the moments of the charge transfer @xmath17 .    in the case of a periodic pumping , it may be useful to define a `` full counting statistics per period '' @xcite as the extensive part of @xmath10 : @xmath18\\ , ,   \\label{chi - extensive}\\ ] ] where the full counting statistics @xmath10 is collected over @xmath19 periods . defined in this way , the characteristic function @xmath20 may be used for calculating extensive quantities ( such as cumulants of the transferred charge ) , but the effects associated with the beginning and ending of the measurement @xcite are neglected .      in the case of non - interacting fermions , the general expression ( [ mbfcs ] ) may be simplified and rewritten in terms of _ single - particle _ operators : the so - called levitov  lesovik determinant formula @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly present its derivation following the approach of ref .  .    for non - interacting fermions , the multi - particle operators ( acting in the fock space )",
    "are related to the corresponding single - particle operators ( acting in the hilbert space of one particle ) with the help of the second - quantized formalism . for notational convenience , we will use the `` hatted '' notation ( as in eq .",

    "now we are ready to derive the levitov  lesovik determinant formula , starting from ( [ mbfcs ] ) and making the following assumptions : + _ 1 ) the operator @xmath7 is a fermionic bilinear .",
    "_ this is obviously true for the operator of the charge in the right lead .",
    "however , more generally , one can use the same formalism for studying full counting statistics for other physical quantities ( e.g. , spin ) .",
    "+ _ 2 ) the evolution operator @xmath6 is an exponential of a fermionic bilinear .",
    "_ this is equivalent to requiring that the hamiltonian is a fermionic bilinear ( see appendix  [ app : fbil ] ) , i.e. , that the fermions are non - interacting .",

    "@xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a hermitian fermionic bilinear ( note that , if using eq .",
    "( [ mbfcs ] ) , we do not need to normalize the density matrix ) .",
    "usually , one considers a thermal equilibrium with @xmath27 given by the physical hamiltonian divided by the temperature .",
    "however , our assumption is much less restrictive .",
    "for example , one can take an initial state with different temperatures of the leads and/or of different channels or even prepare an equilibrium state using a different hamiltonian .",
    "+ _ 4 ) the operators @xmath7 and @xmath5 commute . _",
    "this condition expresses the absence of charge entanglement in the initial state and is a necessary condition for interpreting @xmath10 as a generating function for charge - transfer probabilities .",
    "the trace of the product of exponentials of fermionic bilinears in ( [ mbfcs ] ) can be rewritten as a determinant of an operator acting in the single - particle hilbert space ( see ref .   and appendix  [ app : fbil ] for details ) : @xmath28\\ , .",
    "\\label{spfcs}\\ ] ] here @xmath29 is a single - particle evolution operator and @xmath30 is the occupation - number operator .",
    "depending on the dimensionality and on the asymptotic behavior of the operators involved in ( [ spfcs ] ) , the determinant may require a regularization .    if the dimension of the single - particle hilbert space is finite ( this is the case in the wave - packet formalism of ref .  ) , all the matrices in ( [ spfcs ] ) are finite - dimensional , and no regularization is needed .    if the single - particle hilbert space has an infinite dimension , then a regularization may be needed or not , depending on the properties of the hamiltonians describing the evolution ( in the operator @xmath6 ) and the initial state ( in the operator @xmath31 ) .",
    "usually , one considers a certain dispersion of the particle in the leads ( the same in the evolution and the initial - state hamiltonians ) , with the fermions filling the states up to some fermi energy .",
    "the determinant ( [ spfcs ] ) is well - defined , if the matrix tends to unity sufficiently fast at both large positive and negative energies . at large positive energies",
    ", @xmath32 tends to zero , and the matrix under determinant tends to unity . at large negative energies , the determinant is cut off either by the fermi energy or by the energy dependence of @xmath29 : at very low energy , the particle can not penetrate through the barrier , then @xmath29 commutes with @xmath33 , and the matrix again tends to unity . so the determinant ( [ spfcs ] ) is well defined if one uses exact dispersion relation and the energy dependence of the scattering matrix .    the only ( but historically very common in literature ) case when the determinant needs a regularization is the approximation where the spectrum is linearized ( so that the fermi energy does not serve as a regularizing parameter ) and the scattering matrix is assumed to be energy - independent ( `` instant scattering '' or `` adiabatic pumping '' limit ) @xcite . in that case , the matrix in ( [ spfcs ] ) is infinite - dimensional and tends to a non - unity matrix in the negative - energy asymptotics , therefore the determinant needs to be regularized .",
    "the regularization may be performed by admitting a weak energy dependence of @xmath29 , so that the determinant converges , and then letting the corresponding energy scale tend to infinity .",
    "technically , this procedure amounts to simply re - expressing the determinant in a manifestly convergent form where the weak energy dependence of @xmath29 becomes inessential .",
    "this approach was used in ref .",
    "and then more generally ( but also more formally ) in ref .  . for completeness , we review the details of adiabatic approximation in appendix  [ app : adiabatic ] .    therefore , we assume , without loss of generality , that an appropriate energy dependence is already included in the evolution operator @xmath29 , and the determinant ( [ spfcs ] ) does not need any further regularization",
    "moreover , in the future discussion we will be interested in the zeros of the determinant , which are regularization independent .",
    "to demonstrate that the full counting statistics for non - interacting fermions can be decomposed into elementary single - particle transfer events , we first re - express the determinant ( [ spfcs ] ) in terms of the spectral properties of a single operator , whose eigenvalues give transmission probabilities of those elementary transfers .",
    "this transformation proceeds as follows .",
    "using the fact that the charge operator @xmath33 is a projector ( @xmath34 ) , we rewrite @xmath35 in ( [ spfcs ] ) , in order to obtain , after some simple algebra , @xmath36e^{-i\\lambda q}\\right)\\ , .",

    "4 .   from the above two examples , one can deduce that at zero temperature , in the instant scattering approximation , for a continuous non - periodic time dependence ( a finite - time pumping pulse ) , the spectrum is discrete , if the scattering matrix returns to its initial value , and continuous otherwise .",

    "5 .   for finite temperatures or energy - dependent scattering ,",
    "the spectrum of @xmath38 is typically continuous .",
    "this can be seen in the examples presented in section  [ sec : fcsnonint ] .",

    "a more detailed analysis of the spectrum of the effective transparencies will be presented in a subsequent publication @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of zero temperature and adiabatic pumping , the spectrum of effective transparencies may alternatively be found from a _ different _ operator labeled @xmath70 in ref .   and",
    "@xmath71 in ref .  .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that although the two operators are different , at zero temperature and in the instant - scattering approximation their spectra coincide , as shown in appendix  [ app : adiabatic - nfz ] .",
    "in this section , we illustrate our discussion with several known examples .",
    "an instructive example where the full counting statistics is exactly computable is the case of several lorentzian voltage pulses of one - quantum intensity each : @xmath73 . in this case , as shown in ref .",
    ", the full counting statistics involves only a finite number of transferred electrons . for the effective - transparency spectrum",
    ", this implies a finite discrete spectrum with the number of levels equal to the number of pulses @xcite . in the special case when all pulses are of the same polarity ( this also includes the setup of a constant voltage @xcite as a limiting case ) , all the effective transparencies are degenerate and equal to the transparency of the junction @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number of pulses .",
    "an interesting exactly solvable example with a _ continuous _ spectrum of effective transparencies has been considered in ref .  : a periodic train of openings and closings of the contact . in this case , the distribution of effective transparencies is ( fig .  [",

    "the overall intensity is then given by @xmath90 and the observation time @xmath91 is assumed to be much longer than @xmath92 , so that only the extensive part ( [ chi - extensive ] ) is retained .",
    "the derivation of section [ sec : fcszeros ] shows that the absence of interactions between fermions leads to a generalized binomial statistics of the charge transfer between two conductors . in this section",
    ", we show that if the fermions interact , the zeros of the generating function @xmath14 may shift to the complex plane .    before presenting examples of full counting statistics for interacting fermions ,",
    "let us use a two - particle example to gain some intuition about the positions of the roots of @xmath14 .",
    "consider a system of two particles which propagate from the left to the right lead of the contact .",
    "the full counting statistics is then given by a quadratic polynomial @xmath93 with the probabilities @xmath94 obeying @xmath95 .",
    "the roots of the polynomial become non - real if @xmath96 i.e. , if the probability @xmath97 of separating the two particles becomes too small .",
    "if one considers a strong attraction between particles , so that they become inseparable , then @xmath98 , and the roots of @xmath14 become purely imaginary .",
    "one thus sees that in this example ( i ) the non - reality of roots may be loosely related to an attraction between particles ; ( ii ) a certain threshold of interaction may be needed to shift the roots of @xmath14 from the real axis .",
    "we now turn to several more complicated examples of interacting systems where the full counting statistics may be exactly computed .",
    "a more general example of an electronic system with attraction leading to charge transfer quantized in pairs of electrons ( and hence to a shift of the zeros of @xmath14 from the real axis ) is considered in ref .  : a contact between a normal metal and a superconductor . in the low - temperature limit and at low bias voltage @xmath99 ( so that @xmath100 ) , single - particle tunneling is suppressed , and the full counting statistics is given by @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the probability of andreev reflection and @xmath103 is the effective number of transfer attempts during the observation time @xmath91 . similarly to our two - particle example above , the zeros of @xmath14 are in this case purely imaginary .",

    "@xmath128    one can use this representation to show that the evolution operator for a system of noninteracting fermions is an exponential of a fermionic bilinear .",
    "indeed , the multi - particle evolution operator is given by the time - ordered exponential @xmath129,\\ ] ] where the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath130 is a fermionic bilinear .",

    "has a simple formula @xcite : @xmath133 where the trace is taken in the fock space , and the determinant is in the single - particle space",
    ". for traces of products of exponentials of fermionic bilinears , one finds , using ( [ groupp ] ) and ( [ 1mid ] ) : @xmath134    from this relation , a derivation of the levitov ",
    "lesovik determinant formula easily follows : @xmath135 where @xmath32 is defined by ( [ nf ] ) .",
    "the determinant formula ( [ spfcs ] ) has been derived under the very general assumptions specified in section  [ sec : detfcs ] .",
    "a physically relevant and technically simpler approximation is possible in the situation when the two leads involve asymptotically free electrons , so that the scattering may be described in terms of an instantaneous scattering matrix @xmath136 .",
    "this matrix relates the asymptotic states for electrons at energy @xmath137 scattering on the instantaneous hamiltonian @xmath138 .",
    "if the hamiltonian varies slowly on the scale of the `` scattering time '' @xmath139 , then the evolution operator @xmath29 may be approximated by the wigner transformation of @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding _ adiabaticity condition _ may be formulated as @xmath140 at zero temperature , this condition allows to neglect the energy dependence of @xmath136 , and to replace the scattering operator @xmath29 in ( [ spfcs ] ) by the instantaneous scattering matrix @xmath141 taken at the fermi energy @xmath137 ( since only the states in the vicinity of the fermi energy contribute to the determinant ) @xcite .    at finite temperature ,",
    "to neglect the energy dependence of the scattering matrix , one also needs that the energy dependence of @xmath142 is small on the scale determined by the temperature .",
    "in addition to the adiabaticity condition ( [ adiabcrit ] ) we require : @xmath143 the two conditions ( [ adiabcrit ] ) and ( [ instant - temp ] ) constitute the _ instant - scattering _ approximation ( equivalent to the adiabatic approximation in the case of zero temperature ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the determinant formula becomes @xmath144 where @xmath141 is a local in time unitary scattering matrix .",
    "the determinant ( [ spfcsadiab ] ) , in turn , requires a regularization at negative energies , since the operator under the determinant tends at infinite negative energies to @xmath145 , a non - unity matrix .",
    "this regularization may be performed either by taking into account the finiteness of the negative - energy spectrum or by re - introducing a weak energy dependence of @xmath136 so that @xmath146 . in the latter case ,",
    "the easiest way to implement the regularization is to rewrite ( [ spfcs ] ) as @xcite @xmath147 \\cdot e^{i\\lambda n_f q}u^{\\dagger } e^{-i\\lambda n_f q}u \\big ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{adiab - regularized}\\ ] ] this manipulation is obviously admissible for the `` full '' evolution operator @xmath29 corresponding to the regularized scattering matrix with @xmath146 .",
    "however , in the new expression ( [ adiab - regularized ] ) , one can simply replace @xmath29 by a local in time scattering matrix @xmath141 to obtain a fully convergent expression in the instant - scattering limit .    the regularized formula ( [ adiab - regularized ] ) proposed in ref .",
    "is equivalent to the previously existing regularization prescriptions .",
    "our discussion in this paper does not rely on this regularization , since we always consider the general case of an arbitrary non - interacting evolution operator and therefore may assume that the negative - energy asymptotics is suitably regularized .",
    "generalized binomial statistics for non - interacting fermions has already been proven in our earlier publication under the assumption of zero temperature and instant scattering @xcite .",
    "of course , that result now follows from the more general argument of the present work .",
    "however , we find it instructive to demonstrate explicitly the equivalence of the two results under those more restrictive assumptions .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "that , at zero temperature and in the instant - scattering limit , the effective transparencies of elementary single - particle events are given by the spectrum of the operator @xmath148 ( the same operator was denoted @xmath71 in ref .  ) .",
    "in this appendix , we explicitly show that the spectra of @xmath70 and of @xmath38 coincide , except for the eigenvalues zero and one .    indeed , at zero temperature @xmath32 is a projector operator , and therefore the `` hermitized '' operator @xmath44 given by ( [ tx ] ) , whose spectrum coincides with the spectrum of @xmath38 , is block - diagonal .",
    "the block at positive energies equals @xmath33 and only gives eigenvalues zero and one .",
    "the block at negative energies can be written ( at zero temperature ) as @xmath149 ( we have also used that @xmath33 is a projector ) . on the other hand , one can rewrite ( [ nfz ] ) as @xmath150 from where it becomes obvious that the spectra of @xmath151 and @xmath70 coincide , except for zero eigenvalues ( their eigenvectors can be related to each other by the operators @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) .",
    "this completes the proof of the coincidence of the spectra of @xmath38 and @xmath70 ( modulo eigenvalues zero and one , which do not contribute to the noise , but only to the overall deterministic charge transfer ) .",
