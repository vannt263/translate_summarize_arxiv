    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is not only indispensable in constructing consistent string theories , but it also seems unavoidable at low energies ( @xmath1 ) if the gauge hierarchy problem is to be resolved .",
    "such a resolution provides a measure of the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath2 .",
    "there is indirect evidence for such a low - energy supersymmetry breaking scale , from the unification of the gauge couplings @xcite and from the apparent lightness of the higgs boson as determined from precise electroweak measurements , mainly at lep @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a low energy susy breaking scale is also favored cosmologically , provided that @xmath3-parity is conserved .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath3-conserved susy models contain a stable , neutral particle , identifiable with the lightest neutralino ( @xmath4 ) , referred to as the lsp @xcite .",
    "such a particle is an ideal candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) in the universe . the latest data from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropies @xcite not only favour a flat ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) , inflationary universe , but they also determine a matter density @xmath7 . subtracting from this the baryon density @xmath8 , and the rather tiny neutrino density , one gets @xmath9 for the dm density .",
    "assuming that all dm is supersymmetric due to lsp , i.e. @xmath10 , one can combine the cosmological bound with other presently available constraints from particle physics , such as the lower bound on the mass of the higgs bosons ( @xmath11 ) provided by lep @xcite and the recent results from the bnl e821 experiment @xcite on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the latter is the updated bound after the correction of a sign error in the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution @xcite to @xmath13 .",
    "we find that the updated @xmath13 bound does not put severe constraints on the parameter space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm )  @xcite , especially in the @xmath14 region of this bound , in contrast to the previous situation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this new situation does not seem to affect significantly the potential of discovering susy at future direct dm searches .",
    "in the large @xmath15 regime the neutralino ( @xmath4 ) pair annihilation through @xmath16-channel pseudo - scalar higgs boson ( @xmath17 ) exchange , leads to an enhanced annihilation cross sections reducing significantly the relic density @xcite .",
    "the importance of this mechanism , in conjunction with the recent cosmological data which favour small values of the dm relic density , has been stressed in @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism has been also invoked @xcite where it has been shown that it enlarges the cosmologically allowed regions .",
    "in fact cosmology does not put severe upper bounds on sparticle masses , and soft masses can be in the tev region , pushing up the sparticle mass spectrum to regions that might escape detection in future planned accelerators .",
    "such an upper bound is imposed , however , by the ( @xmath18 ) e821 data and has been the subject of intense phenomenological study the last year @xcite . as was mentioned above , for large @xmath19",
    "the @xmath20 or @xmath21 channel becomes the dominant annihilation mechanism .",
    "in fact by increasing @xmath19 the mass @xmath22 decreases , while the neutralino mass remains almost constant , if the other parameters are kept fixed .",
    "thus @xmath22 is expected eventually to enter into the regime in which it is close to the pole value @xmath23 , and the pseudo - scalar higgs exchange dominates .",
    "it is interesting to point out that in a previous analysis of the direct dm searches @xcite , we had stressed that the contribution of the @xmath24-even higgs bosons exchange to the lsp - nucleon scattering cross sections increases with @xmath19 . therefore in the large @xmath19 region one obtains the highest possible rates for the direct dm searches .",
    "similar results are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the correct calculation of the neutralino relic density in the large @xmath15 region ,",
    "an unambiguous and reliable determination of the @xmath17-mass is required .",
    "the details of the procedure in calculating the spectrum of the cmssm can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we shall only briefly refer to some subtleties which turn out to be essential for a correct determination of @xmath22 . in the cmssm",
    ", @xmath22 is not a free parameter but is determined once the other parameters are given .",
    "@xmath22 depends sensitively on the higgs mixing parameter , @xmath25 , which is determined from minimizing the one - loop corrected effective potential . for large @xmath19",
    "the derivatives of the effective potential with respect the higgs fields , which enter into the minimization conditions , are plagued by terms which are large and hence potentially dangerous , making the perturbative treatment untrustworthy . in order to minimize the large @xmath19 corrections we had better",
    "calculate the effective potential using as reference scale the average stop scale @xmath26 @xcite . at this scale",
    "these terms are small and hence perturbatively valid . also for the calculation of the pseudo - scalar higgs boson mass all the one - loop corrections",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of those of the neutralinos and charginos yields a result for @xmath22 that is scale independent and approximates the pole mass to better than @xmath27 @xcite . a more significant correction , which drastically affects the pseudo - scalar mass arises from the gluino  sbottom and chargino ",
    "stop corrections to the bottom quark yukawa coupling @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the proper resummation of these corrections is important for a correct determination of @xmath28 @xcite , and accordingly of the @xmath22 . in calculating the @xmath4 relic abundance",
    ", we solve the boltzmann equation numerically using the machinery outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this calculation",
    "the coannihilation effects , in regions where @xmath29 approaches in mass the lsp , which is a high purity bino , are properly taken into account .",
    "after the correction of the error in the sign of the hadronic light - by - light contribution to @xmath13 , actually there is no @xmath30 disagreement between the experimental value and the standard model prediction .",
    "there is still an @xmath31 discrepancy , and one can also study the @xmath32 bound .",
    "if we are going to attribute this discrepancy to susy the @xmath33 case is relevant .",
    "in addition the @xmath34 case is not favoured by the recent @xmath35 data .     in the @xmath36 plane .",
    "the remaining inputs are shown in each figure .",
    "the mass of the top is taken @xmath37 . in the dark green shaded area @xmath38 . in the light green shaded area @xmath39 .",
    "the solid red lines mark the region within which the supersymmetric contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is @xmath40 .",
    "the dashed red line is the boundary of the region for which the lower bound is moved to @xmath41 limit .",

    "the dashed red line is the boundary of the region for which the lower bound is moved to @xmath41 limit .",
    "the dashed - dotted blue lines are the boundaries of the region @xmath42.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the panels shown in figure  [ fig1 ] we display our results by drawing the cosmologically allowed region @xmath38 ( dark green ) in the @xmath43 plane for values of @xmath19 equal to @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . also drawn ( light green ) is the region @xmath46 . in the figures shown we used for the top ,",
    "tau and bottom masses the values @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the remaining inputs are shown on the top of each panel .",
    "the solid red mark the region within which the supersymmetric contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon falls within the e821 range @xmath49 .",
    "the dashed red line marks the boundary of the region when the more relaxed lower bound @xmath41 value of the e821 range . along the blue dashed - dotted lines the light @xmath24-even higgs mass takes values @xmath50 ( left ) and @xmath51 ( right ) respectively .",
    "the line on the left marks therefore the recent lep bound on the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "also shown is the chargino mass bound @xmath52 . the shaded area ( in red ) at the bottom of each figure , labelled by th , is theoretically disallowed since the light stau is lighter than the lightest of the neutralinos .",
    "from the displayed figures we observe that for values of @xmath19 up to @xmath44 the cosmological data put an upper bound on the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "however , there is practically no such upper bound for the parameter @xmath54 , due to the coannihilation effects @xcite which allow for @xmath55 as large as @xmath56 within the narrow coannihilation band lying above the theoretically disallowed region .    for large values of @xmath15 ,",
    "see the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , a large region opens up within which the relic density is cosmologically allowed .",
    "this is due to the pair annihilation of the neutralinos through the pseudo - scalar higgs exchange in the @xmath16-channel . as explained before , for such high @xmath19 the ratio @xmath57 approaches unity and the pseudo - scalar exchange dominates yielding large cross sections and hence small neutralino relic densities . in this case",
    "the lower bound put by the @xmath18 data cuts the cosmologically allowed region which would otherwise allow for very large values of @xmath43 .    for the @xmath58 case , close the highest possible value , and considering the lower bound on the muon s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath59 and values of @xmath60 in the range @xmath61 , we find that the point with the highest value of @xmath53 is ( in gev ) at @xmath62 and that with the highest value of @xmath54 is at @xmath63 .",
    "the latter marks the lower end of the line segment of the boundary @xmath64 which amputates the cosmologically allowed stripe . for the case displayed in the right panel of the figure  [ fig1 ] the upper mass limits put on the lsp , and",
    "the lightest of the charginos , stops and the staus are @xmath65 ( in @xmath66 ) . allowing for @xmath67 values , the upper bounds put on @xmath43 increase a little and so do the aforementioned bounds on the sparticle masses .",
    "thus it appears that the prospects of discovering cmssm at a @xmath68 collider with center of mass energy @xmath69 , are not guaranteed .",
    "however in the allowed regions the next to the lightest neutralino , @xmath70 , has a mass very close to the lightest of the charginos and hence the process @xmath71 , with @xmath70 subsequently decaying to @xmath72 or @xmath73 , is kinematically allowed for such large @xmath19 , provided the energy is increased to at least @xmath74 .",
    "it should be noted however that this channel proceeds via the @xmath75-channel exchange of a selectron and it is suppressed due to the heaviness of the exchanged sfermion .",
    "the constraints put by the @xmath76 @xmath77 bound are extremely weak , especially for large values of @xmath19 , as the @xmath78 is proportional to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "actually the @xmath76 region lies in the border line of lhc @xcite .    , from a random sample of 40,000 points . on the top of the figure the cdms excluded region and the dama sensitivity region",
    "are illustrated .",
    "diamonds ( @xmath79 ) are points within the e821 experimental region @xmath80 and which are cosmologically acceptable @xmath81 .",
    "crosses ( @xmath82 ) represent the rest of the random sample .",
    "the higgs boson mass bound @xmath83 is properly taken into account . ]",
    "we turn now to study the impact of the @xmath18 measurements and of the higgs mass bound @xmath83 on the direct dm searches . for this reason we are using a random sample of 40,000 points in the region @xmath84 , @xmath85",
    ", @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we plot the scalar @xmath4-nucleon cross section as function of the lsp mass , @xmath89 . on the top of the figure the shaded region ( in cyan colour )",
    "is excluded by the cdms experiment @xcite .",
    "the dama sensitivity region ( coloured in yellow ) is also plotted @xcite .",
    "diamonds ( @xmath79 ) ( in green colour ) represent points which are both compatible with the e821 data @xmath90 and the cosmological bounds for the neutralino relic density @xmath91 .",
    "the crosses ( @xmath82 ) ( in red colour ) represent the rest of the points of our random sample . here",
    "the higgs boson mass bound , @xmath83 has been properly taken into account . from this figure",
    "it is seen that the points which are compatible both the ( @xmath0 ) e821 and the cosmological data ( crosses ) yield cross sections of the order of @xmath92 pb and the maximum value of the @xmath89 is about @xmath93 .    , from a random sample of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "diamonds ( @xmath79 ) are cosmologically acceptable points , without putting any restriction from the @xmath78 . crosses ( @xmath82 ) represent points with unacceptable @xmath60 . ]    in figure  [ fig3 ] we do nt impose the constraints stemming from @xmath0 data , therefore due to the coannihilation processes the cosmologically acceptable lsp mass can be heavier than @xmath94 .",
    "it is worth noticing that that imposing the @xmath0 bound the lowest allowed @xmath4-nucleon cross section increases by about one order of magnitude , from @xmath95 pb to @xmath92 pb . considering the @xmath88 case , it is important that using the cosmological bound for the dm alone , one can put a lower bound on @xmath96 .",
    "this fact is very encouraging for the future dm direct detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case for @xmath34 , where the @xmath97 can be very small , due to an accidental cancellation between the sfermion and higgs boson exchange processes .",
    "however , as discussed before , this case is not favoured by @xmath35 data .",
    "similar results are presented in ref .",
    "in conclusion , we have combined recent high energy physics experimental information , like the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon measured at e821 brookhaven experiment and the light higgs boson mass bound from lep , with the cosmological data for dm . especially for the @xmath13 bound",
    "we have used the revised value taking into account the correct sign in the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution .",
    "we studied the imposed constraints on the parameter space of the cmssm and hence we assessed the potential of discovering susy , if it is based on cmssm , at future colliders and dm direct searches experiments .",
    "the use of the @xmath31 @xmath13 bound can guarantee that in lhc but also in a @xmath98 linear collider with center of mass energy @xmath99 , cmssm can be discovered .",
    "the @xmath32 bound is rather weak , resulting to a very heavy sparticle spectrum , especially for large @xmath15 .",
    "actually this bound lies in the border line of lhc .",
    "the effect of these constraints is also significant for the direct dm searches . for the @xmath88 case , even ignoring the @xmath13 bound , we found that the minimum value of the spin - independent @xmath4-nucleon cross section attained is of the order of @xmath95 pb .    * acknowledgements * + a.b.l . acknowledges support from hprn - ct-2000 - 00148 and hprn - ct-2000 - 00149 programmes .",
