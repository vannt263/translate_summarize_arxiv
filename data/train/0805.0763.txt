    "consider first the case where the scalar field itself dominates the expansion , so that @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath29 always decreases with time , @xmath46 is also a decreasing function of time , so that @xmath35 always increases with time .",
    "the other possibility is that the universe is dominated by a background fluid ( e.g. , matter or radiation ) with density @xmath47 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath48 .",
    "we can again assume that @xmath46 decreases with time . in order for @xmath0 to serve as a plausible dark energy candidate ,",
    "its density must decrease more slowly with the expansion than the density of matter or radiation .",
    "hence , we can conclude that @xmath49 increases with time , and once again we have that @xmath35 increases with time .",
    "thus , for any model in which @xmath0 serves as the dark energy today , @xmath35 is an increasing function of time , regardless of whether the universe is background - dominated or @xmath0-dominated .    before examining the implications of this result",
    ", we reconsider the behavior discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and described by equation ( [ liddlelimit ] ) . equations ( [ wturner ] ) and ( [ liddlelimit ] ) , taken together , imply that scalar field oscillations are an attractor in a universe dominated by a background fluid only for the case where @xmath50 further , for a power - law potential given by equation ( [ power ] ) , in the background - dominated case , equation ( [ nuapprox ] ) can be expressed as @xmath51 applying equation ( [ wturner ] ) , this becomes @xmath52 which can be rewritten in terms of the scale factor ( using equation ( [ rhoevolve ] ) for @xmath29 and the corresponding equation for @xmath47 ) as @xmath53 a comparison of equations ( [ nua ] ) and ( [ wphiliddle ] ) provides a physical explanation for the bound noted by liddle and scherrer @xcite .",
    "when this bound ( equation [ liddlelimit ] ) is not satisfied , equation ( [ nua ] ) indicates that @xmath35 is a _ decreasing _ function of time .",
    "thus , at late times , the oscillating solution can not be an attractor .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ; when equation ( [ liddlelimit ] ) is not satisfied , the scalar field decays asymptotically to the minimum of the potential without oscillating .",
    "these models do not contradict our claim that in any oscillating scalar field model for dark energy , @xmath35 always increases with time .",
    "the reason is that models that violate the bound in equation ( [ liddlelimit ] ) have an energy density that decays more rapidly than @xmath47 ; they are not plausible models for dark energy .    now consider the possible oscillating scalar field models for dark energy . the fact that @xmath35 increases with time simplifies the classification of such models .",
    "if we assume that the universe evolves from a matter - dominated state to a scalar - field dominated state , there are basically three possibilities , which depend on the redshift at which @xmath32 becomes greater than @xmath3 :    i. the oscillation frequency becomes greater than the expansion rate during the matter - dominated era .",
    "since @xmath35 increases with time , we always have @xmath54 during the quintessence - dominated era , and we can use time - averaged quantities to describe the equation of state of the quintessence . we will call this the early - oscillation case .",
    "this is basically the model described in refs .",
    "@xcite , so these models have been exhaustively explored .",
    "the oscillation frequency is less than @xmath3 at the present day .",
    "again , since @xmath35 always increases with time , this implies that @xmath32 is never larger than @xmath3 , so these models never reach the oscillatory stage . in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite , these are thawing models in which the field has not yet reached the minimum of the potential .",
    "such models are characterized by a value of @xmath10 very close to @xmath55 initially , which increases at late times .",
    "we will call this the  no oscillation \" case . again , such models have been exhaustively explored ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the case intermediate between i and ii occurs when @xmath32 becomes greater than @xmath3 at late times , after the quintessence density exceeds the matter density . in this case",
    ", the scalar field displays two distinct behaviors during the quintessence - dominated era . at first , when the oscillation frequency is less than @xmath3 , the scalar field rolls down the potential and @xmath10 increases .",
    "then , when the oscillation frequency becomes greater than @xmath3 , the field oscillates rapidly , and @xmath10 takes its time - averaged value as in refs . @xcite .",
    "this third possibility has not been previously studied ; we will refer to it as the  late oscillation \" case .",
    "although we believe that our classification scheme in the previous section should describe most possible models for quintessence from oscillating scalar fields , it is obviously impossible to compare all such models with the observational data .",
    "we will therefore limit ourselves to a representative set of models : the power - law oscillating scalar field models discussed in refs .",
    "as we note below , we believe that the general features of the results we derive for these models will be more generally applicable to other oscillating scalar field models .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose the potential to have the form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath24 are constants .",
    "then the evolution of the field depends on three parameters : @xmath57 , @xmath24 , and the initial value of @xmath0 , which we denote @xmath58 .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath57 can be eliminated from the equation of motion ( equation [ motionq ] ) by a suitable rescaling of @xmath0 and the time @xmath59 .",
    "this rescaling means that we are no longer using planck units , but our units of time are irrelevant , since we always define the  present day \" in terms of the value of @xmath60 , rather then @xmath59 .",
    "( another way to see this is to note that all of our results depend only on the evolution of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath60 , and @xmath61 depends only on @xmath62 , which is independent of @xmath57 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the evolution can be described entirely in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath58 .    for a given choice of values of the two free parameters , @xmath58 , and @xmath24",
    ", we numerically evolve the system from a starting point in the matter dominated regime to the point when @xmath63 , which we label as the present time @xmath64 .",
    "the relation between the evolution of @xmath0 and the two input parameters is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ oscbehavior_plot ] . in our numerical simulations",
    ", we define oscillations to commence when the scalar field crosses @xmath65 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath10 increasing from @xmath55 to @xmath66 and marks the point at which @xmath67 first changes sign .",
    "( note that the oscillation frequency for @xmath10 is twice as large as the oscillation frequency for @xmath0 ) .",
    "for early oscillations , this zero - crossing takes place during the matter - dominated era , while for late oscillations it takes place during the quintessence - dominated era .",
    "the no oscillation case corresponds to the parameter region in which zero crossing never occurs up to the present .    for a given @xmath24 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath58 determines when the oscillations will begin . from equation ( [ powernu ] )",
    "( or [ nuapprox ] ) , it is clear that small @xmath58 corresponds to a larger value of @xmath35 for a given ratio of @xmath29 to @xmath6 .",
    "thus , oscillations commence earlier if @xmath58 is small and later if @xmath58 is large . for fixed @xmath24 ,",
    "sufficiently small @xmath58 will produce the early oscillation case , while sufficiently large @xmath58 gives no oscillations , with late oscillations arising from intermediate values of @xmath58 .",
    "this is apparent in fig .",
    "[ oscbehavior_plot ] .",
    "fixing @xmath24 , we see that increasing @xmath58 moves the evolution from early oscillation , through late oscillation , and into no oscillation .",
    "since the late oscillation case has not been previously explored , we present a graph , in fig .",
    "[ hi_phi ] , of the evolution of @xmath68 for some of these models .",
    "as claimed , @xmath10 initially evolves slowly upward from @xmath69 , but then oscillates rapidly at late times ; this transition takes place after the quintessence field becomes dominant .",
    "next , we compare the theoretical luminosity - vs - distance results to the recent type ia supernovae standard candle data ( essence+snls+hst from @xcite ) . the theoretical distance modulus in our model is calculated in the standard way : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km sec@xmath72 mpc@xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the dimensionless luminosity distance , given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 , the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath76 , also depends on @xmath77 and the parameters of our quintessence model .",
    "we construct a @xmath78 likelihood plot for @xmath58 and @xmath24 ranging from 0.01 to 0.40 ( no further structure emerges from extending the parameter space ) .",
    "we take @xmath79 and marginalize over the nuisance parameter @xmath71 .",
    "[ likelihood_plot ] shows this plot .",
    "some of the allowed regions can be understood in terms of our previous discussion of the behavior of the field . in the limit of large @xmath58 ,",
    "the field never oscillates , and it can be effectively treated as a cosmological constant , which is known to be a good fit to the observational data . for sufficiently small @xmath58",
    ", we are in the  early oscillation \" regime . in this case , @xmath10 takes on a constant value determined by equation ( [ wturner ] ) and independent of @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear from equation ( [ wturner ] ) that a value of @xmath10 near @xmath55 requires a value of @xmath24 close to zero .",
    "thus , we see in fig .",
    "[ likelihood_plot ] that for small @xmath58 , the allowed region is confined to small values of @xmath24 ( which give @xmath10 near @xmath55 ) , and the likelihood contours become vertical lines ( indicating that the late - time value of @xmath10 is independent of @xmath58 in this limit ) .    to explore the allowed parameter space",
    "further , we have superimposed the field behaviors outlined in fig .",
    "[ oscbehavior_plot ] onto the likelihood contours displayed in fig .",
    "[ likelihood_plot ] .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ likelihood_phi ] . as noted earlier , almost the entire  no oscillation \" parameter space is allowed , while the  early oscillation \" parameter space is confined to the region for which @xmath10 is close to @xmath55 .",
    "however , we also see that there is an allowed region in the  late oscillation \" regime ; this is the subset of oscillating models that has not been previously explored . in these models ,",
    "the field is initially slowly rolling down the potential , with increasing @xmath10 ; it then transitions into rapid oscillations at late times .",
    "an interesting feature in this regime is the non - smooth structure of the confidence contours .",
    "this is a real effect .    to illustrate the reason for the non - smooth confidence contours , we have sampled four representative models in this regime , denoted by the four diamonds in fig .",
    "[ likelihood_plot ] , which correspond to @xmath80 and @xmath810.10 , 0.12 , 0.13 , and 0.15 .",
    "( these are the four models previously displayed in fig . [ hi_phi ] ) .",
    "this illustrates the complex structure of the allowed region as @xmath82 and 0.13 are ruled out at 95% confidence , while @xmath83 and 0.15 are not .",
    "next , we display the distance modulus for these four models , along with the supernova data , in fig .",
    "[ mu1_plot ] .",
    "although the individual models can not be distinguished here , it is clear that all of these models lie near the edge of the allowed region because they tend to produce a distance modulus that is lower than the observations . in fig .",
    "[ mu2_plot ] , we show a blow - up of fig .",
    "[ mu1_plot ] .",
    "the smallest values of the distance modulus are produced for @xmath82 and 0.13 ; these are the two models that are ruled out at 95% confidence .",
    "the important point here is that the distance modulus is not a monotonic function of @xmath58 .",
    "the reason for this is illustrated in fig . [ rhophi_plot ] , where we give the redshift dependence of the density of the scalar field ( which determines @xmath84 , and therefore , @xmath85 ) . comparing this figure with fig .",
    "[ hi_phi ] , we see that @xmath84 depends crucially on the oscillation phase at the present day .",
    "the two models for which the field is at a maximum of the potential at present ( thus giving @xmath69 at present ) are @xmath82 and @xmath86 .",
    "these produce a larger density at moderate redshift and therefore a smaller integrated value of @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the complex behavior of our contours in figs .",
    "[ likelihood_plot ] and [ likelihood_phi ] is a phase effect : the phase of @xmath0 at present is an oscillating function of @xmath58 , and this phase determines whether or not a given model is excluded . for early oscillation models",
    "the phase becomes irrelevant , since these models oscillate many times before the present , and the equation of state parameter takes on its period - averaged value .",
    "our results indicate that oscillating quintessence models , even for very simple potentials , can display more complex behavior than has previously been considered .",
    "previous discussions have centered on the early oscillation case , in which the oscillation frequency is always much larger than the expansion rate when the scalar field dominates the expansion .",
    "our results show that the late oscillation case , in which the scalar field transitions from a slowly rolling regime at early times into oscillations at late times , can also be consistent with current observations , although the behavior of these latter models depends crucially on the oscillation phase of the scalar field at present .",
    "johnson and kamionkowksi @xcite have argued recently that rapidly - oscillating scalar fields with a time - averaged value of @xmath10 less than @xmath88 are unstable to the growth of inhomogeneities ( see also the argument in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    ", only the late oscillation models would remain as acceptable oscillating scalar field models for dark energy .",
    "how general are our results ?",
    "the conclusion that @xmath35 increases with time depends only on the assumption that the scalar field energy density decays more slowly than the background energy density , so it should be generally applicable to any plausible model for dark energy . on the other hand , our comparison of models with observations was restricted to the case of power - law potentials .",
    "however , we would expect qualitatively similar results for other bound potentials with a single minimum at @xmath89 . if the minimum of the potential were at @xmath90 ,",
    "the analysis is almost identical , except that the dark energy now has an additional component with constant density @xmath91 .",
    "such a model would have a values of @xmath68 closer to @xmath55 than the corresponding model with a minimum at @xmath89 , and thus , would tend to agree more closely with current observations .",
    "one type of potential that could display completely different behavior from those studied here is a @xmath1 with multiple minima , such as the mexican hat potential discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , the field evolution can be considerably more complex , as the field can initially oscillate over the entire range of the potential , but will eventually become trapped in a local minimum at late times . in this case",
    "the simple analysis presented here will not apply ."
