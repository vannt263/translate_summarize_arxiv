    "in particular , the paper @xcite considers the simplest case at the level of , namely the scalar case @xmath24 , and shows that even in this situation the analysis is already quite complicated : in fact , one has to follow the evolution of every elementary component of a wavefront , which we call _ wave _ ( see ( * ? ? ?",
