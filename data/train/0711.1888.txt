    "many clues about the processes of planet formation and evolution have been discovered by studying the ensemble properties of exoplanets , such as the `` brown dwarf desert '' ( halbwachs et al .",
    "2000 , marcy & butler 2000 ) and the tendency for metal - rich stars to have more detectable planets ( santos et al .",
    "2003 , fischer & valenti 2005 ) . however , there are also individual exoplanets whose properties bear directly on theories of planet formation and evolution",
    ". one of the best examples is the transiting planet hd  149026b ( sato et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "compared to saturn , hd  149026b has a similar mass but its radius is 15% smaller , despite the intense irradiation from its parent star that should _ enlarge _ the radius .",
    "sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) modeled hd  149026b as a dense heavy - element core surrounded by a fluid envelope of solar composition .",
    "they found a core mass of 70 - 80  @xmath4 , which is 65 - 75% of the total mass of the planet . this is larger than the canonical core mass of 10 - 20  @xmath4 that is expected from the core - accretion theory of planet formation ( mizuno 1980 , pollack et al .",
    "the finding of a highly metal - enriched composition was confirmed in models by fortney et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , ikoma et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , broeg & wuchterl  ( 2007 ) , and burrows et al .",
    "the latter authors dubbed hd  149026b a `` super - neptune '' because the inferred mass fraction of heavy elements is similar to that of an ice giant rather than a gas giant .",
    "interestingly , the parent star has a rather high metallicity ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 ; sato et al .",
    "the observation of a large core in such a metal - rich system would seem to support the core - accretion theory as opposed to coreless alternatives such as gravitational instability ( boss 1997 ) .",
    "however , the larger - than - expected core mass raises some questions .",
    "why did the growing protoplanet not accrete gas efficiently ? or if it did , what happened to its envelope of light elements ?",
    "many scenarios have been proposed : a collision of two massive protoplanets ( sato et al .",
    "2005 , ikoma et al .",
    "2006 ) , _ in situ _ formation in a low - pressure nebula ( broeg & wuchterl  2007 ) , a viscous and evaporating gas disk ( ikoma et al .",
    "2006 ) , and a separation of gas from planetesimals at the magnetospheric `` x point '' ( sato et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "more recently , harrington et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the 8  @xmath6 m brightness temperature of hd  149026b exceeds its expected blackbody temperature , even if the planet is assumed to absorb all of the incident stellar radiation . in this sense",
    "the planet is anomalously hot .",
    "the high temperature may result from novel atmospheric or structural properties .",
    "most recently , torres et al .  ( 2007 ) announced the discovery of a transiting planet , hat - p-3b , whose measured mass and radius indicate that it too is highly enriched in heavy elements .",
    "in short , hd  149026b seems to be the harbinger of an entirely new kind of planet that current models of planet formation , evolution , and structure can not accommodate without interesting and possibly exotic modifications .",
    "because of this situation , it is desirable to improve the reliability and the precision of estimates of the system parameters , and especially a key parameter that makes this planet unusual : its small radius .    one can measure the planetary radius by gathering photometry during transits , modeling the light curve , and supplementing the model with external information about the stellar radius .",
    "previously , sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analyzed 3 light curves , and charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2006 ) added 3 light curves . in this paper",
    "we present another 5 light curves of comparable or higher quality to the previously published data , and we simultaneously model all of the data to derive the most precise planetary , stellar , and orbital parameters that are currently available .",
    "we present our observations and data reduction procedure in   2 and the light - curve modeling procedure in   3 .",
    "we provide the results in   4 , along with an extended discussion about the limiting error : the uncertainty in the stellar radius .",
    "the final section summarizes the results and speculates on future prospects for improvement .",
    "we used three of the 0.8  m automated photometric telescopes ( apts ) at fairborn observatory to measure the transits of hd  149026b that occurred on ut  2006  april 26 , 2006  may  20 , 2007  may  3 , 2007  june  18 , and 2007  june  21 .",
    "we observed the first three transits with the t11 apt and observed the last two transits simultaneously with the t8 , t10 , and t11 apts .",
    "all three telescopes are equipped with two temperature - stabilized emi 9124qb photomultiplier tubes for measuring photon count rates simultaneously through strmgren @xmath7 and @xmath8 filters .    on a given night , each telescope automatically acquired brightness measurements of hd  149026 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and the comparison star hd  149504 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , which was previously demonstrated to be stable in brightness at the 0.002  mag level or better ( sato et al .",
    "we also measured the dark count rate and the sky brightness in the vicinity of each star .",
    "we used a diaphragm of diameter @xmath13 for all the integrations .",
    "the integration time was 20 seconds on the comparison star and 30 seconds on the ( fainter ) target star .",
    "we computed the magnitude difference for each pair of target - comparison observations . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of each measurement , the differential magnitudes from the @xmath7 and @xmath8 pass bands were averaged , resulting in a differential magnitude for a synthetic @xmath14 pass band .",
    "the typical cadence of the differential magnitude measurements was 1.4  min for the first 3 transits and 1.2  min for the last 2 transits .",
    "for each raw light curve , we fitted a linear function of time to the out - of - transit data and divided the data by this function .",
    "this was intended to correct for differential airmass effects and other systematic errors in the photometry , and also to normalize each light curve to have unit mean flux outside of the transit .",
    "( we also tried fitting a function of airmass rather than time , but this gave slightly poorer results . )",
    "the final light curves are shown in fig .  1 , and",
    "the data are given in table  1 .",
    "the standard deviation of the out - of - transit data is approximately 0.2% in all cases , which is typical for apt observations of bright stars . for additional information on the telescopes , photometers , observing procedures , data reduction techniques , and typical photometric precision ,",
    "see henry  ( 1999 ) or eaton , henry , & fekel ( 2003 ) .",
    "the lower right panel in fig .  1 is a composite light curve of all 8 transits observed by the apts from sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and this paper .",
    "the composite light curve was created by subtracting the mid - transit time from each of the time stamps , and then averaging into 30 second bins .",
    "it is shown here for display purposes only ; the fitting procedure described in the next section was carried out on the unbinned data .",
    "we fitted all of our new photometric data jointly with the three @xmath14 light curves presented by sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and the @xmath15 and @xmath16 light curves presented by charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2006).-band light curve of charbonneau et al .  ( 2006 ) because of its comparatively large errors and sparse time sampling . ]",
    "we used a parameterized model based on a two - body circular orbit .",
    "the orbit is specified by the masses of the star and planet ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , the inclination with respect to the sky plane ( @xmath19 ) , the orbital period ( @xmath20 ) and a particular midtransit time ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the star and planet are taken to be spheres with radii @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , and when their sky - projected centers are within @xmath24 of one another we use the mandel & agol  ( 2002 ) formulas to compute the flux decrement due to the partial blockage of the limb - darkened stellar surface .",
    "this is the same code that has been developed for the transit light curve project ( holman et al .",
    "2006 , winn et al .",
    "2007 ) . for hd  149026",
    ", we assumed the limb darkening law to be linear , with a coefficient given by claret  ( 2000 ) for a star of the appropriate temperature and surface gravity .",
    "for the @xmath14 data we used a coefficient of 0.712 , which is the mean of the tabulated @xmath7 and @xmath8 coefficients .",
    "not all of the parameters listed above can be determined from transit photometry alone .",
    "one set of parameters that can be determined from an individual light curve is @xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath19 , where @xmath27 is the semimajor axis .",
    "our approach was to fix @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 at previously determined values ( thereby fixing @xmath27 through kepler s third law ) , and then fit for @xmath23 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the results for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are specific to the choice of @xmath17 , but they scale as @xmath28 because @xmath29 when the uncertainty in @xmath20 is negligible , as it is here .",
    "we assumed @xmath30  @xmath31 , following sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , a choice that was subsequently corroborated by our analysis of the observable stellar properties and the results for @xmath26 ( see   4.2 ) .",
    "the fitting statistic was @xmath32 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the number of flux measurements , @xmath34(obs ) is the flux observed at time @xmath35 , @xmath36 controls the weights of the data points , and @xmath34(calc ) is the calculated flux .",
    "experience has shown that the data weights @xmath36 should account not only for the single - measurement precision but also the time - correlated ( `` red '' ) noise that afflicts most time - series photometry ( see , e.g. , gillon et al .",
    "the most important timescale in a transit light curve is the @xmath3710  min duration of the ingress and egress , since the resolution of ingress and egress is what permits the determination of @xmath26 and @xmath19 in addition to @xmath25 . to assess the noise on this timescale , we first calculated the standard deviation of the unbinned out - of - transit data ( @xmath38 ) for each light curve .",
    "then we averaged the out - of - transit data into 10  min bins consisting of @xmath39 data points , where @xmath39 depended on the observing cadence , and recalculated the standard deviation ( @xmath40 ) . in the absence of red noise",
    ", one would expect @xmath41 , but in practice @xmath40 was larger than @xmath42 by some factor @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we set the data weights equal to @xmath44 . the results for @xmath43 ranged from 1.05 to 1.27 .",
    "we used a markov chain monte carlo algorithm to determine the best - fitting parameter values and confidence intervals .",
    "this algorithm delivers an estimate of the _ a posteriori _ joint probability distribution for all of the parameters ( see holman et al .  2006 or winn et al .",
    "2007 for more details ) . for each parameter",
    ", we took the mode of the distribution after marginalizing over all other parameters to be the `` best value . ''",
    "we defined the 68% confidence limits @xmath45 and @xmath46 as the values between which the integrated probability is 68% , and for which the two integrals from @xmath47 and @xmath48 were equal .    at first , the preceding computations were performed using free parameters for both the orbital period and a single midtransit time . thus the transits were required to be spaced by integral multiples of a fixed period .",
    "however , we also wanted to measure the individual transit times , in order to search for variations that might be indicative of additional bodies in the planetary system ( agol et al .",
    "2005 , holman & murray 2005 ) . to do this , we fixed @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath19 at the best values determined in the first step , and then performed a three - parameter fit of each individual light curve .",
    "the parameters were @xmath21 along with the zero point and slope of the linear function that was used to correct the out - of - transit data .",
    "( fixing the values of @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath19 is justified because the errors in those parameters are not correlated with the error in the transit time . )",
    "we did this not only for the 5 new light curves , but also for the 5 previously published light curves , to provide consistency in the treatment of errors .",
    "we then used these transit - time measurements to refine the estimates of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( see   4.3 ) . for our final results for the photometric parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath19",
    ", we reran the mcmc algorithm on the entire data set , using fixed values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 from our refined ephemeris .",
    "the results of the light - curve analysis are given in table  2 and discussed in ",
    "the transit times of the individual light curves are given in table  3 , and in   4.2 we use those times to derive a new transit ephemeris .",
    "we also use the new ephemeris along with a previously - measured midpoint of a secondary eclipse to place an upper bound on one aspect of the orbital eccentricity . in order to derive the actual planetary radius ( as opposed to the planet - to - star radius ratio ) , one must supplement the light - curve analysis with external information about the stellar radius or mass . in   4.3 we investigate four different methods to estimate the stellar radius , the results of which are given in table  4 . the planetary parameters derived from the light curves and the stellar radius estimates are given in table  5 .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ probability distributions for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath19 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the most well - constrained of these three basic light curve parameters is the radius ratio , @xmath0 , with a precision of approximately 2.3% .",
    "the radius ratio is determined largely by the observed transit depth , which is the smallest among all of the 20 transiting planets known to date . while there are smaller planets , such as the neptune - sized gj  436b ( gillon et al .",
    "2007 ) , they all orbit smaller stars , making their radius ratios and transit depths larger than that of hd  149026 .    less well - constrained are @xmath26 and @xmath19 , the parameters that depend on the observed durations of the ingress , egress , and total phases of the transit . table  2 gives the results for those parameters as well as the impact parameter and the durations , which can be derived in terms of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the data are consistent with impact parameters ranging from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . as with any eclipsing binary system",
    ", the data can not distinguish between positive and negative impact parameters ; the probability distributions are perfectly symmetric about @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this case",
    "the peak probability occurs at the central values @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 has a highly asymmetric error bar .",
    "the observed duration of the entire transit event enforces the upper limit on @xmath26 , while the ratio of the ingress ( or egress ) duration to the total duration enforces the lower limit on @xmath26 .",
    "our findings are consistent with the two previous light - curve analyses , by sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , although our analysis method is different in several ways besides the use of an expanded dataset .",
    "first , we have attempted to account for time - correlated noise in the photometry , which was neglected in the previous analyses .",
    "second , unlike the previous authors , we have not incorporated any _ a priori _ constraints on the stellar properties into our fitting statistic .",
    "we made this choice in order to clarify what information is derived from the light curves themselves ; for example , the previous works did not call attention to the results for @xmath25 even though that parameter is more precisely known than either @xmath23 or @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , our analysis method provides an estimate of @xmath26 that is independent of any assumptions about the parent star , except for the very weak dependence on the chosen limb darkening parameter .",
    "this is useful because @xmath26 can be used to determine the stellar mean density ( seager & mallen - ornelas 2003 , sozzetti et al .",
    "2007 , holman et al .  2007 ) : @xmath53 the last term in this expression may be neglected in this case because @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "our independent estimate of @xmath56 is useful in characterizing the parent star , as described below .      to determine the quantity of intrinsic interest , @xmath23",
    ", we can multiply our result for @xmath25 by a value of @xmath22 obtained by other means .",
    "we have investigated four different methods for determining @xmath22 :    _ stefan - boltzmann law._the bolometric luminosity , effective temperature , and photospheric radius of hd  149026 are related via @xmath57 .",
    "we use the _ hipparcos _ parallax and apparent magnitude ( @xmath58  mas , @xmath59 ; perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) to compute the absolute @xmath60 magnitude , apply a bolometric correction of @xmath61 ( flower et al .",
    "1996 ) , and use the spectroscopically determined @xmath62  ( sato et al .  2005 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath63  @xmath64 .",
    "this is essentially identical to the value quoted by sato et al .",

    "( 2006 ) presented an alternative means of estimating the effective temperature and bolometric correction , using @xmath65 photometry .",
    "they also provided radius estimates for many nearby stars based on this technique .",
    "using the _ hipparcos _ parallax and @xmath60 magnitude along with 2mass near - infrared photometry , their result for hd  149026 is @xmath66  @xmath64 .    _ yonsei - yale isochrone",

    "we used the yonsei - yale models ( yi et al .",
    "2001 , demarque et al .  2004 ) because they are conveniently provided with tools for interpolating isochrones in both age and metallicity .",
    "for the effective temperature , we used @xmath67  k , a weighted mean of the results of sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and masana et al .",
    "we used the photometric result for @xmath26 as our our proxy for surface gravity , and we explored the range  @xmath5 with an internal uncertainty of @xmath68 . to be conservative , we adopted a somewhat larger uncertainty of @xmath69 , recognizing that different methods for determining the metallicity often produce systematic differences of this size .",
    "] of metallicities [ fe / h ]  @xmath70 . for each metallicity",
    "we considered a range of ages from 0.1 to 14 gyr , in steps of 0.1 gyr .",
    "we interpolated the isochrones using a fine mass grid and compared the points with the measured values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we computed @xmath73 at each point based on the modeled and observed values of @xmath71 , @xmath26 , and metallicity .",
    "then we weighted the points by @xmath74 and applied an additional weighting to take into account the density of stars on each isochrone , assuming a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "the `` best - fitting '' stellar properties were taken to be the weighted mean of the properties of all the points . for more details and other applications of this analysis ,",
    "see torres , winn , & holman ( in preparation ) . for hd  149026 ,",
    "the results are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "similar results were obtained when the spectroscopically determined value of @xmath78 was used instead of @xmath26 . the theoretical isochrones and the observational constraints",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "kepler s law with stellar mass prior._as mentioned earlier , the quantity @xmath26 that is determined from the transit photometry can be used to find @xmath56 ( eq .  2 ) .",
    "with an _ a priori _ estimate of @xmath17 , one may use @xmath56 to determine @xmath22 .",
    "taking @xmath79  @xmath31 based on the isochrone fit described above , we find @xmath80  @xmath64 .",
    "all of the results for the stellar radius are summarized in table  4 .",
    "they are all consistent with one another at the 1@xmath81 level , with a weighted mean of @xmath82  @xmath64 .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that while the methods are different , they are not wholly independent .",
    "the first two methods both rely on the _ hipparcos _ parallax , which is the largest source of error in both cases .",
    "the latter two methods both rely on the yonsei - yale stellar evolutionary models . for this reason we can not say confidently that the uncertainty in @xmath22 is any smaller than the uncertainty in each of the individual measurements , although the mutual agreement is certainly reassuring . in what follows",
    "we adopt the consensus value @xmath83  @xmath64 , the same value used in the previous light curve analyses .    assuming a gaussian error distribution for @xmath22 , and the error distribution for @xmath25 obtained from our light curve analysis",
    ", we find the planetary radius to be @xmath84  @xmath2 .",

    "2005 ) and @xmath86  @xmath87 ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2006 ) , keeping in mind our different method of analysis and treatment of observational errors .",
    "the results are all in agreement .",
    "indeed the differences are smaller than one would expect from gaussian statistics , given the quoted error bars , though we note that 5 of the 10 light curves we fitted were taken from those previous works .",

    "it is important to be able to predict transit times as precisely as possible .",

    "eclipses should be spaced by exactly half an orbital period .",
    "recently , harrington et al .",
    "( 2007 ) observed a secondary eclipse of hd  149026 with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , allowing the assumption of a circular orbit to be checked .",
    "in the presence of a small but nonzero orbital eccentricity , the time difference between the midpoint of secondary eclipse , @xmath94 , and the time of transit , @xmath95 , is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the argument of pericenter ( kallrath & milone 1999 , p.  62 ) .",
    "harrington et al .",
    "( 2007 ) measured the midpoint of a secondary eclipse to be hjd  @xmath98 , represented by the open circle in figure 4 .",
    "the timing offset of equation ( 6 ) is @xmath99  minutes , corresponding to @xmath100 .",
    "the orbit does indeed appear to be nearly circular , as one would expect from the dissipative effects of stellar and planetary tidal interactions .",
    "we have presented 5 new transit light curves of the exoplanet hd  149026b and analyzed them along with 5 previously published light curves .",
    "the joint analysis has resulted in much more precise determinations of the orbital period and transit ephemerides , and also in a more precise value of the planet - to - star radius ratio . in some cases , this ratio is of primary interest , such as inferring the brightness temperature of the planet from the depth of a secondary eclipse ( harrington et al .",
    "2007 ) , or testing for any wavelength dependence in the radius ratio as a means of identifying planetary atmospheric features ( see , e.g. , charbonneau et al .  2002 ) .",
    "however , when it comes to understanding the interior structure of the planet , the quantity of primary interest is @xmath23 itself , and here we can offer no significant improvement .",
    "the limiting error is the 7% uncertainty in the stellar radius .",
    "this error was not reduced by acquiring more light curves , although we did find agreement between the results of 4 different ( and intertwined ) methods for estimating the stellar radius using all of the available data .",
    "thus , we leave unchanged the interpretation of this planet as a being unexpectedly small for its mass , and likely to be highly enriched in heavy elements ( sato et al .  2005 , fortney et al .",
    "2006 , ikoma et al .",
    "2006 , burrows et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "further improvement will depend upon progress in measuring the stellar radius .",
    "baines et al .",
    "( 2007 ) recently used optical interferometry to measure the angular diameter of the planet - hosting star hd  189733 , and combined it with the _ hipparcos _ parallax to measure the stellar radius . for hd  149026 ,",
    "similar observations are not likely to result in a more precise value of the stellar radius , at least not in the near future .",
    "this is not only because of the 6% uncertainty in the parallax , but also because the expected angular diameter is only @xmath101180  @xmath6as , which is only 78 times larger than the measurement error that was achieved for hd  189733 .",
    "supposing the parallax were known with 10  @xmath6as precision ( as one might hope from a space - based interferometric mission ) , the error in the stefan - boltzmann method for determining @xmath22 would be reduced to 2.7% .",
    "the limiting errors in that case would arise from the effective temperature and bolometric correction . in the nearer term ,",
    "a possible path forward is the continued acquistion of high - quality transit photometry , in order to improve upon our measurement of @xmath26 and thereby establish the stellar mean density with greater precision . at fixed mean density",
    ", @xmath22 varies as @xmath28 , and our application of the yonsei - yale models to hd  149026 suggests that the stellar mass has already been pinned down to within 4.6% . if @xmath26 were known exactly , the fractional error in the stellar radius would be approximately 1.5% ( i.e. , one - third as large as the fractional error in the stellar mass ) . in effect , transit photometry measures @xmath102 , and the stellar models generally constrain a different combination of @xmath17 and @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , cody & sasselov 2002 ) .",
    "we encourage observers to be persistent in gathering additional seasons of ground - based photometry and look forward to the results of space - based photometry for this system .",
