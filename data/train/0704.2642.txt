    "the flux of the blackbody is varied . in figure",
    "[ fig : incident ] , we plot the korista continuum and the soft blackbody with several values of flux . we understand that the net continuum shown in figure  [ fig : incident ] is not representative of any real continuum ; this exercise is simply meant to demonstrate the effect of the continuum at @xmath143 , the wavelength of the uv3@xmath28 transitions ( table  [ table : wavelengths ] ) , upon the x - ray line ratios . in figure",
    "[ fig : rlimit ] , we plot the @xmath0-ratio as a function of the flux of the second continuum component , holding everything else constant .",
    "the ratio changes by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the blackbody only contributes to the net continuum for energies less than about 10 - 30  ev .",

    "we also plot the @xmath1-ratio in figure  [ fig : rlimit ] .",
    "pumping in the singlet levels by the continuum at uv1 is much less effective than in the triplet case because the uv1 line strength is many orders of magnitude less than the resonance line strength , especially considering the fact that the resonance line is already being pumped in the low flux limit . because the resonance intensity ( the @xmath1-ratio denominator ) is not strongly affected by the uv1 pumping , and because the uv3@xmath28 pumping decreases one term of the @xmath1-ratio numerator while increasing the other , the @xmath1-ratio is much less affected than the @xmath0-ratio .",

    "<S> a complete model of helium - like line and continuum emission has been incorporated into the plasma simulation code cloudy . </S>",

    "<S> this includes photoionization from all levels , line transfer including continuum pumping and destruction by background opacities , scattering , and collisional processes . </S>",
    "<S> the model is calculated self - consistently along with the ionization and thermal structure of the surrounding nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a complete line and continuum spectrum of the plasma . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the ions of the he  i sequence and reconsider the standard helium - like x - ray diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider semi - analytical predictions and compare these with previous work in the low - density , optically - thin limit . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform numerical calculations of helium - like x - ray emission ( such as is observed in some regions of seyferts ) and predict line ratios as a function of ionizing flux , hydrogen density , and column density . in particular , we demonstrate that , in photoionized plasmas , the @xmath0-ratio , a density indicator in a collisional plasma , depends on the ionization fraction and is strongly affected by optical depth for large column densities . we also introduce the notion that the @xmath0-ratio is a measure of the incident continuum at uv wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-ratio , which is temperature - sensitive in a collisional plasma , is also discussed , and shown to be strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well . </S>",
    "<S> these distinguish a photoionized plasma from the more commonly studied collisional case . </S>"
