    "the large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ? * ) on the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ is a superb instrument with which to study rotation - powered pulsars . since mid-2008",
    ", it has been used to detect more than 170 pulsars at energies above 0.1gev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "has identified millisecond pulsars ( msps ) as a ubiquitous class of gamma - ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these old neutron stars , spun up by accretion from an evolved companion @xcite , are a relatively local and isotropically distributed population , that make up only 10% of the identified population of pulsars in the galactic disk",
    ". however , about half of known gamma - ray pulsars are msps .",
    "nearly half of the known gamma - ray msps were discovered as radio objects in undirected ( `` all sky '' ) surveys prior to the launch of .",
    "gamma - ray pulsations were subsequently detected with the aid of rotational ephemerides obtained from radio timing observations .",
    "many slowly - rotating pulsars have been discovered via direct periodicity searches of sparse gamma - ray photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but so far this has not been possible unbiasedly for binary msps . however , the lat has led to the discovery of msps in a different , and prolific , fashion . in the three lat source catalogs",
    "@xcite , there are hundreds of unidentified sources , many of which have spectral characteristics typical of pulsars . radio searches of many of these have turned up dozens of msps so far , and once the radio ephemerides have been obtained , gamma - ray pulsations have almost always followed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the csiro parkes telescope in 2009 , we discovered five msps in a radio survey of 14 unidentified lat sources @xcite . in an extension of that survey",
    "we have discovered five more msps .",
    "here we present the completed survey , and report on radio timing , polarimetric , and gamma - ray studies of some of the msps .",
    "in this section we describe the radio searches of unidentified gamma - ray sources that we performed at the parkes telescope ( section  [ sec : searches ] ) , the sensitivity of the survey and relevant selection effects ( section  [ sec : sensitivity ] ) , radio timing and polarimetric observations of the pulsars discovered ( sections  [ sec : timing ] and [ sec : pol ] ) , gamma - ray results for one of them ( section  [ sec : gamma ] ) , and some x - ray observations ( section  [ sec : xray ] ) .",
    "@xcite used a digital filterbank at parkes to search 11 unidentified sources from the first  lat catalog ( 1fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "two msps and one slow pulsar were discovered in single observations of each target at a central frequency of 1.4ghz .",
    "subsequently , one of these msps was found to be associated with the corresponding lat source .    at nearly the same time",
    ", in late 2009 , we used an analog filterbank at parkes to search 14 unidentified 1fgl sources @xcite .",
    "the single observations of these targets resulted in the detection of six msps , five of them discoveries .",
    "however , confirmation of some of these msps was not easy : the search observations lasted for 12hr each , but some of the pulsars were not detected in equivalent initial confirmation attempts , owing to the effects of interstellar scintillation .",
    "these and other selection effects ( see section  [ sec : sensitivity ] for details ) led us to search some promising unidentified lat sources repeatedly .",
    "our subsequent searches used the same equipment and methods as @xcite . in brief",
    ", total - power measures from the central beam of the 20 cm multibeam receiver were filtered into 512 contiguous 0.5mhz - wide channels centered on 1390mhz and sampled 8000 times per second , then digitized with 1-bit precision and written to disk for off - line analysis .",
    "individual integration times were about 1hr , and each lat source was observed between one and nine times , depending on the then - perceived quality of the source and telescope availability ( table  [ tab : survey ] ) .",

    "the remaining sources were classified by visual inspection of the gamma - ray spectral energy distribution to pick out candidates with spectral shape resembling those of known pulsars , which typically have exponentially cut - off power - law spectra @xcite .",

    "the pulsar was not detected unbiasedly , because of the dilution of power in the fourier domain caused by the rapid non - linear change in projected orbital velocity for this 3hr binary system .",
    "a constant - acceleration search such as the ones we performed can not correct for this effect well enough . ]    as well , a considerable fraction of lat - selected msps is in eclipsing binary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "multiple observations of a promising source can thus help combat these factors affecting detectability .",
    "in addition , the flux density received from many msps is severely affected by interstellar scintillation ( see , e.g. , figure  1 of * ? ? ? * ) . as we now show , this has played a very significant role in our survey , and the early realization of the magnitude of some of these selection effects is what led us to do multiple observations of many unidentified lat sources starting in 2010 ( section  [ sec:2fgl ] ) .      in order to acquire the detections required to determine the timing solution for  ( section  [ sec : timing ] ) , we used 100hr of parkes telescope time in 79 observations on 54 days spread over 2yr . in only 27 of those observations",
    "did we detect the pulsar in a _",
    "relatively _ unbiased manner  by dedispersing the raw data using the known dm , performing an acceleration search , and looking for a signal with period 3.589ms . in several of those observations the pulsar was not detectable without prior knowledge of the dm and approximate period .",
    "a pulsar like  is therefore discoverable in a search like ours at parkes less than 1/3 of the time !",
    "this is due to its small intrinsic flux density combined with very large modulation owing to propagation through the dynamic and inhomogeneous interstellar medium ( see figure  [ fig : scint ] ) .",

    "away from the galactic plane , putative pulsar counterparts to unidentified gamma - ray sources are largely expected to be relatively nearby msps , which as a class have relatively small space velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "depending on observing parameters ( frequency , bandwidth , and integration time ) , these characteristics can make them particularly susceptible to deep flux density fluctuations , in turn with important implications for radio searches .",
    "scintillation modulations in the strong regime have exponential statistics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with median flux density measurements less than the mean .",
    "two of the six msps for which we have already obtained timing solutions ( section  [ sec : timing ] ) display flux densities that vary by a factor of @xmath150 , with small median values and , given scintillation statistics , not detectable in an unbiased manner most of the time for the parameters of our parkes survey .",
    "the foregoing strongly suggests that an unidentified lat source that is a good pulsar candidate should be searched repeatedly before much of a statement can be made about the likelihood of it being a radio msp beaming towards the earth .",
    "eight of the 10 msps that we discovered were detected on their first observations ( table  [ tab : survey ] ) , but as the preceding account illustrates , in some cases ( particularly for psrs  j1514@xmath64946 and j1658@xmath65324 ) this was fortuitous . based on our empirical evidence ,",
    "we judge that every promising lat source should be observed a _ minimum _ of three or four times in a survey such as the one we did at parkes before it can reasonably be considered searched in an average sense .",
    "as indicated in table  [ tab : survey2 ] , we consider that a number of our survey targets remain promising pulsar candidates , and at least some should be re - searched in radio .",

    "they find that all three models match the gamma - ray and radio profiles fairly well .",
    "however , the complete lack of polarization that we observe ( figure  [ fig : pol]d ) strongly favors the altpc and alog models , where high - altitude caustics are predicted to have a strong depolarizing effect @xcite , over the lasg model , where one expects non - zero polarization from near - surface emission .    for , the high level of observed linear polarization and modest p.a .",

    "@xcite find models that plausibly match the gamma - ray light curves , but the radio profiles are not well reproduced .",
    "our survey of unidentified lat sources had a success rate of 20% ( 11 msps detected unbiasedly in 56 sources searched ; section  [ sec : searches ] ) , despite significant selection effects ( section  [ sec : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "this is very encouraging  a substantial number of unidentified lat sources contain previously unknown msps that can be detected at parkes , and our source selection criteria have allowed us to target them with satisfactory efficiency . however , comparing the initial segment of the survey ( section  [ sec:1fgl ] ) with the latter portion ( section  [ sec:2fgl ] ) reveals a drop in efficiency : we had to search 3.5 times as many sources in 2012 , for twice as long in the aggregate , to discover as many pulsars as earlier on .    since our observations",
    ", another six pulsars have been discovered in these very same sources : four via direct pulsation searches of the gamma - ray photons , one of which was subsequently detected as a very faint radio source with the gbt ( the others might be significantly affected by scintillation , or perhaps they may yet prove to be gamma - ray - only pulsars ) ; one at the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at a lower frequency than at parkes ( perhaps the parkes non - detections reflect a steep radio spectrum ) ; and one that is a transient radio source  not active when we did our parkes searches , but now detectable there ( see notes l  o in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ) .",
    "considering these additional detections , a full 10 of the original 14 targets of our survey are now known to contain pulsars !",
    "this reflects superb source selection criteria for those targets . why has the success rate decreased since then ?",
    "the original ( 1fgl - based ) sources were brighter in gamma rays , allowing for relatively unambiguous determination of spectral characteristics , on which we based our target selection .",
    "there might be secondary effects related to this : e.g. , the brighter 1fgl - based targets might be nearer to the earth on average , and any associated radio pulsars could then also be brighter on average , although we do not see such an effect among our small sample of _ detected _ msps .",
    "now that the third catalog of lat sources is in hand , based on substantially more data and a much better understanding of the instrument and background than was available earlier , we can usefully revisit our 56 sources and the msps found amid them . in table",
    "[ tab : survey2 ] we have summarized some properties of these sources as obtained from the 3fgl catalog .",
    "given that gamma - ray pulsars typically have exponentially cut - off power - law spectra @xcite , by contrast to power - law spectra for agn , it is not surprising that the spectral curvature gleaned from 3fgl correlates well with gamma - ray pulsars : of the 12 pulsars with known gamma - ray pulsations listed in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ( the eight classified as `` psr , '' as well as j1035.7@xmath66720 , j1227.9@xmath64854 , j1624.2@xmath64041 , and j1744.1@xmath67619 ) , 10 display significant curvature according to 3fgl ( @xmath317 ; table  [ tab : survey2 ] ) .",
    "however , two other established gamma - ray msps ( psrs  j1747@xmath64036 and j1903@xmath67051 , reported here ) show no curvature , according to 3fgl ( @xmath318 ) . now that 170 gamma - ray pulsars are known , it is to be expected that some may depart from the norm .",
    "in addition , `` curve '' in 3fgl tests against a log - parabolic spectral model , which may not be a good proxy for testing against exponentially cut - off power laws , especially when the source is not very bright or the background is problematic ( as it happens , these two msps are the faintest in gamma rays of the 12 under consideration ; see `` sig '' in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ) . thus , in considering whether a particular 3fgl source is a good pulsar candidate , we should do more than simply look for significant cataloged curvature .",
    "flux information is available from the 3fgl pipeline processing in five energy bins ( two within 0.11gev , two within 110gev , and one for 10100gev ) .",
    "after familiarizing ourselves with how known gamma - ray pulsars ( and control sources ) appear in five - bin spectra by visual inspection of many 3fgl plots , we have classified the 56 target sources of our parkes survey according to a heuristic ranking scheme that we describe next .",
    "we qualitatively assess the likelihood of a source being a pulsar . according to this scheme",
    ", a classification of `` 1 '' denotes near certainty of being a pulsar ; `` 2 '' is less conclusive but quite plausible ; `` 3 '' is a poorer pulsar candidate ; `` 4 '' is very likely not a pulsar ; `` 5 '' is not a pulsar .",
    "these classifications are based on combinations of the following spectral characteristics ( both are listed for each source in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ) : strong energy cutoff ( c ) ; parabolic ( peak at center energies , p ) ; flat or rising spectrum at @xmath319gev ( r )  c , p , r are `` positive '' features leading to higher likelihood of a source being a pulsar ( for examples , see figure  [ fig:3fglspectra]c and e ) . power law ( l ) ; variability ( v ) ; monotonically decreasing ( d ) or increasing ( i ) ; excess high energy emission ( flat or rising spectrum ; h )  l , v , d , i , h are `` negative '' features , not ordinarily associated with pulsars ( see figure  [ fig:3fglspectra]a and d ) .",
    "capitalization means that the features are more certain , except for p / p which indicates the sharpness of the parabola .",
    "a `` ? '' indicates poor spectral quality , increasing uncertainty in classification .",
    "an asterisk represents an odd spectrum with `` banana '' shape to high energy ( see figure  [ fig:3fglspectra]b ) . in figure  [ fig:3fglspectra ]",
    "we show 3fgl spectral plots for six of our parkes targets that illustrate the features described above .      of the 12 known gamma - ray pulsars in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ,",
    "nine are classified as 1 and two others ( already noted in section  [ sec : psrclass ] as not curved in 3fgl ) as 2 .",
    "the one confirmed gamma - ray msp classified as a 3 , psr  j1227@xmath64853 , is a spectral outlier ( figure  [ fig:3fglspectra]b ) . in a rare state - changing binary system , it is borderline variable within 3fgl , and recently displayed significant variability ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this and its sister system j1023 + 0038 @xcite , as well as the young pulsar j2021 + 4026 @xcite , are counterexamples to the usual assumption that pulsars are steady gamma - ray emitters . of the other five msps known in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ( none of which has yet a reported long - term timing solution or detected gamma - ray pulsations ) , one is classified as 1 , one as 2 , and three as 3 . based on prior statistics , we expect that most , perhaps all , of these five msps will eventually be established as gamma - ray pulsars . that most have a relatively poor classification in our scheme likely reflects their faintness ( three , all discovered in our survey , have 3fgl significance of 6.68.8@xmath320 ) , or location close to the galactic plane ( psr  j1536@xmath64948 is at @xmath321 ) .",
    "following from the discussion in section  [ sec : unidclass ] , while we certainly recommend additional searches first of the `` 1 '' sources that remain without coincident pulsars ( of which there are seven in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ) , followed by the `` 2 '' sources ( nine in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ) , the `` 3 '' sources ( seven in table  [ tab : survey2 ] ) are also reasonable candidates for further searches4402 , has recently been reported to be a binary system currently with an accretion disk @xcite . ] . among these 23 sources , two",
    "are coincident with globular clusters that currently have no known pulsars , and a population of msps in those clusters is a plausible origin for the gamma - ray emission . we expect further msp discoveries among these 23 targets : while the largest offset between our optimized search and the 3fgl positions is 3 , which is not very large compared to the @xmath322 half - width at half - maximum parkes beam , many promising targets have not been searched enough to counter the selection effects presented in section  [ sec : sensitivity ]  e.g. , four of the seven `` 1 '' sources have been searched at parkes only once or twice at locations not far from their 3fgl positions ( see table  [ tab : survey2 ] ) . in addition , in the near future we intend to re - analyze our existing data sets with `` jerk searches , '' i.e. , accounting for changing accelerations that are relevant for short orbital periods ( cf .  figure  [ fig : j1946 ] ) .",
    "after all such searches are done , it remains a possibility that through a combination of faintness and extreme orbital and spin parameters , some of those promising lat sources could still harbor undetected radio msps beamed towards the earth .",
    "it is also possible that some of these sources may be msps that are detectable only via their gamma - ray emission , although this fraction is known to be small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
