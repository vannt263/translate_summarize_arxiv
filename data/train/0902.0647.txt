    "in the past decade , significant progress has been made toward understanding the more evolved stages of massive star formation , phases from hot molecular cores to hyper compact hii regions .",
    "it becomes clear that massive proto b stars are associated with molecular outflows and rotating disks @xcite .",
    "therefore , they likely form through a disk mediated accretion @xcite . active mass accretion can continue during the hyper compact hii region phase when the ionization radius is within the gravitational radius @xcite .",
    "all these studies represents phases of massive star formation after the central star has formed and begun hydrogen burning .",
    "contrary to these progresses , little is known about the initial phases of massive star formation .",
    "since most massive stars are born in a cluster environment @xcite , the initial phase of massive star formation is intimately linked to cluster formation and the fragmentation of molecular clouds .",
    "while theoretical work provides physical insights into fragmentation process , direct observations of precluster molecular clouds are crucial in revealing how the process may take place . among all the observational efforts , studies of infrared dark clouds ( irdc ) , massive clouds at extremely early stages of evolution , hold great promise and has grown rapidly over the past several years .",
    "irdcs were first discovered in large number by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) @xcite through infrared absorption against the bright galactic background .",
    "systematic studies found that many irdcs contain over @xmath6  of dense molecular gas @xcite .",
    "while some massive irdcs show signs of massive star formation through 2o maser emission @xcite , ch@xmath1oh maser emission @xcite , molecular outflows @xcite , and bright 24 @xmath7 m emission @xcite , a large majority do not show signs of star formation @xcite . with a typical star formation efficiency ,",
    "the large amount of dense gas in these irdcs makes them the natural birth place for massive stars and clusters .",
    "thus , these regions are premium sites for uncovering the initial conditions of massive star and cluster formation .",
    "@xcite imaged an irdc g28.34 + 0.06 with the very large array in the 3 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines in the d configuration .",
    "an overview of the region is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the cloud , at a distance of @xmath84.8 kpc , contains several @xmath6 m@xmath9 of dense gas along the infrared absorption filament extending 6 pc in the sky @xcite .",
    "two prominent dust continuum clumps , p1 and p2 , are revealed in the 850 and 450 @xmath7 m images obtained from the jcmt @xcite and the 1.2 mm image obtained from the iram 30 m telescope @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that two clumps contain a similar amount of dense gas within 0.3 pc , the p2 region has a high gas temperature of 30 k , large 3 line width of 3.3 -1 and is associated with a strong 24 @xmath7 m point source with far ir luminosity of @xmath6 .",
    "this is in contrast to p1 which has a gas temperature of 13 k , a relatively narrow 3 line width of 1.7 -1 , and an upper limit to the luminosity of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the gas in p1 appears to be externally heated with temperatures decreasing from 20 k in the outside of the cloud to 13 k inside of the cloud .",
    "likewise , the turbulence measured by the 3 line widths appears to decrease from larger spatial scales to smaller scales .",
    "these observations led @xcite to suggest that p1 is at a much earlier stage of massive star formation compared to p2 .    in order to study the cloud structure , we imaged the p1 and p2 clumps at @xmath11 resolution with the sma .",
    "the sensitive continuum image at 1.3 mm reveals 5 dense cores toward the p1 clump .",
    "the p2 region exhibits rich molecular line emission similar to hot molecular cores , while the p1 cores are absent of molecular line emission , which indicates heavy depletion .",
    "observations with the sma were carried out with 7 antennas in the compact configuration on 2006 august 07 , and 8 antennas in the extended configuration on 2008 july 22 .",
    "the pointing centers of the observations were ra ( j2000 ) = 18:42:52.09 , dec ( j2000 ) = -3:59:52.00 for p2 and ra ( j2000 ) = 18:42:50.74 , dec ( j2000 ) = -04:03:15.34 for p1 .",
    "the fwhm of the primary beam of the two pointings is shown as the dashed circles in figure 1 .",
    "for the compact configuration , quasars 1741 - 038 and 1908 - 201 were used as time dependent gain calibrators , uranus and ganymede were used as bandpass and flux calibrators , respectively .",
    "the system temperatures during the observations varied from 200 to 600 k. the receivers were tuned to an lo frequency of 225 ghz . with",
    "if frequencies of @xmath12 ghz , the observations covered rest frequencies from 220 through 222 ghz in the lsb , and 230 through 232 ghz in the usb , with a uniform channel spacing of 0.8125 mhz ( @xmath8 1 -1 ) across the entire band .    for observations with the extended configuration , we used 1751 + 096 and 1911 - 201 as gain calibrators , 3c279 and 3c454.3 as bandpass calibrators , and callisto as a flux calibrator .",
    "the system temperatures during the observations were around 100 k. the receivers were tuned to an lo frequency of 220 ghz and covered rest frequencies of 215.7 through 217.7 ghz in the lsb , and 225.7 through 227.7 ghz in the usb , with a uniform channel spacing of 0.4062 mhz ( @xmath8 0.5 -1 ) across the entire band .",
    "a detailed description of the sma is given in @xcite .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated with the idl superset mir package developed for the owens valley interferometer .",
    "the absolute flux level is accurate to about 15% . after the calibration in mir ,",
    "the visibility data were exported to the miriad format for further processing and imaging .",
    "the continuum is constructed from line free channels in the visibility domain .",
    "the projected baselines range from 12 to 68 m in the compact configuration , and 20 to 221 m in the extended configuration .",
    "we combined the continuum data from both configurations , which yields a synthesized beam of about 1.2@xmath5 , and a @xmath13 rms of 1 mjy in the naturally weighted maps .",
    "the spectral line data presented here is from the compact configuration only , with a @xmath13 rms of 90 mjy  beam@xmath14 per 1.2 -1 channel , and a spatial resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute position is @xmath16 , derived from comparing the secondary gain calibrators with their catalog positions .",
    "figure 2 presents the 1.2 mm continuum emission from the iram 30 m telescope @xcite , the 3 ( 1,1 ) emission from the vla @xcite , and the sma 1.3 mm dust continuum emission . to describe the dust emission , we follow the nomenclature in the literature that _ clumps _ refer to structures with sizes of @xmath8 1 pc ,",
    "_ cores _ refer to structures within a clump with sizes of @xmath8 0.1 pc , and _ condensations _ refer to sub structures within a core . as shown in figure 2 , the two dust clumps p1 and p2 detected with the iram 30 m telescope and jcmt at resolutions from 11@xmath5 to 15@xmath5 @xcite are resolved by the sma into multiple structures at @xmath17 resolution .",
    "the p1 clump splits into five cores ( p1-sma1 , p1-sma2 , p1-sma3 , p1-sma4 and p1-sma5 ) with an average projected separation of @xmath18 or 0.19 pc .",
    "these cores show further substructures that may correspond to condensations .",
    "since we do not have complementary spectral line data at a resolution of @xmath19 , we defer analysis of the substructure to a future paper .",
    "the emission in p2 , on the other hand , is resolved into two strong , distinctive cores , p2-sma1 and p2-sma2 .",
    "2o masers reported in @xcite coincide with p1-sma2 and p2-sma2 to within 0.1@xmath5 .",
    "the continuum images from the sma and the iram 30 m telescope are in a remarkably good agreement with the 3 emission .",
    "the five continuum cores ( p1-sma1 through p1-sma5 ) lie along the 3 ridge .",
    "there is a feature in the 30-m continuum image extending toward another 3 peak in the northwest .",
    "the sma image from the compact configuration reveals a peak at 5 mjy ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this peak is not detected in the @xmath17 resolution image presented in figure 2 .",
    "the 1.2 mm integrated flux densities from the iram 30 m telescope are 2.6 jy and 1.3 jy , toward p2 and p1 , respectively .",
    "neither clumps have detectable continuum emission at centimeter wavelength at a level of 1 mjy @xcite , thus the mm flux arises predominantly from the dust emission . using the dust opacity of @xcite , an emissivity index of @xmath21 = 1.5 , and a temperature of 13 and 30 k derived from 3 @xcite , we obtained dust mass of 1000 and 880  for p1 and p2 , respectively , with an average 2 density of @xmath22 3 .",
    "the masses in the p1 and p2 clumps are consistent with the estimate in @xcite from 850 @xmath7 m and 450 @xmath7 m if one factors in the different values of dust temperatures used . for @xmath21",
    "= 2 as assumed in @xcite , we obtain a mass of 2000 and 1760  for the p1 and p2 clumps , respectively .",
    "we measure the flux density toward the dust cores in the sma images . for the p2 cores",
    ", the integrated fluxes were obtained from fits of elliptical gaussian .",
    "for the p1 cores , we derived the integrated fluxes within a polygon encompassing each core .",
    "the peak positions and the integrated fluxes are listed in table 1 . the 3 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) data reveal gas temperatures of 13 to 16 k in cores toward p1 , and 30 k in cores toward p2 . using the same dust opacity law and a dust emissivity index of @xmath21 = 1.5 , appropriate for massive dense cores based on multi - wavelength observations at mm and submm wavelengths @xcite",
    ", we obtained dust masses for the cores ranging from 22 to 97 .",
    "the corresponding 2 densities in these cores range from @xmath23 to @xmath24 3 .",
    "these parameters are also listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectra over the 4 ghz bandpass of the sma toward p2-sma1 , and the strongest core , p1-sma4 , in the p1 clump .",
    "the spectra are made from the compact configuration with a resolution of @xmath25 . toward p2-sma1 ,",
    "emissions of co isotopologues , so , and more complex molecules ch@xmath1oh , h@xmath26co , hnco , as well as ch@xmath1cn are detected .",
    "the presence of complex organic molecule is similar to that of hot cores observed with the sma @xcite .",
    "the classical hot core molecule ch@xmath1cn is detected in the k=0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 components of the j=12 - 11 transition .",
    "physical parameters , namely , column density and temperature , have been estimated by fitting ch@xmath1cn spectrum , in the lte approximation , and taking into account the optical depth effect .",
    "the best fit gives a temperature of 120 k , representative of the temperature value in a typical hot core .",
    "in contrast to the rich line spectra in p2-sma1 , no molecular line emission except the faint @xmath2co 2 - 1 emission is detected toward p1-sma4 .",
    "one can estimate co depletion from the 2 - 1 emission of the co isotopologes . toward the p2 position",
    ", the @xmath27co to c@xmath4o ratio yields an optical depth of 1.8 in the @xmath27co 2 - 1 line assuming a [ @xmath27co/@xmath4o ] of 40 .",
    "we use the c@xmath4o 2 - 1 transition to estimate the co column density because it is optically thin , and is least affected by missing short spacing in the sma data as compared to @xmath27co and @xmath2co . with a brightness temperature of 2.5k , a fwhm of 2.5 -1 in the c@xmath4o 2 - 1 line width , and a gas temperature of 30k , we obtain a @xmath2co column density of @xmath28 2 , assuming a [ @xmath2co / c@xmath4o ] of 240 . on the other hand , the 2 column density derived from the dust emission , assuming a dust to gas ratio of 1:100 amounts to @xmath29 2 .",
    "these values give rise to a [ co / h@xmath30 ratio of @xmath31 , a factor of 100 lower than the standard value of @xmath32 in [ co / h@xmath30 ratio .",
    "similarly , one can estimate co depletion from the upper limit of 0.1k in the c@xmath4o 2 - 1 line in p1-sma4 . if the c@xmath4o 2 - 1 emission is optically thin , the 0.1 k upper limit and the 13k gas temperature yield a @xmath2co column density of @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the 1.3 continuum emission gives rise to an 2 column density of @xmath35 @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we obtain a [ co / h@xmath30 ratio of @xmath36 , or a co depletion of @xmath6 from the standard [ co / h@xmath30 ratio .",
    "the non detection of molecular line emission with the sma is in staunch contrast with the strong line emission in co isopologues , cs , hcn toward p1 with the iram 30 m telescope ( rathborne personal communication ) .",
    "the brightness temperatures of the @xmath27co and c@xmath4o 2 - 1 lines are 3 and 1 k , respectively .",
    "the line ratio yields an optical depth in @xmath27co of 2 . with a gas temperature of 16 k from the single dish 3 @xcite and a brightness temperature of 1k in the c@xmath4o 2 - 1 line",
    ", we obtain a column density of @xmath37 @xmath34 in @xmath2co . the 2  column density , based on the measurement from the iram 30 m telescope at 1.2 mm",
    "is @xmath38 @xmath34 .",
    "these values yield a [ co / h@xmath30 ratio of @xmath39 , which is 40 times lower than the typical value ( 10@xmath40 ) in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite reported a similar results in the [ co / h@xmath30 ratio toward this region .    the estimates above yield co depletion upto 10@xmath41 to @xmath6 in p2 and p1 , respectively .",
    "it is known that carbon bearing molecules such as co are heavily depleted in low - mass prestellar cores @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is seen in massive cores over a scale of nearly 0.1 pc , much larger than the @xmath6 au scale in the low - mass prestellar cores .",
    "the timescale of depletion for an average density of @xmath42 3is several @xmath43 yrs @xcite .",
    "this timescale sets a lower limit to the age of the p1 cores at @xmath44 years .",
    "the dust emission from the sma observations appears to be centrally peaked . for a core internally heated by a protostar ,",
    "the dust temperature scales as @xmath45 @xcite with @xmath46 . if the core density @xmath47 scales as @xmath48 , then the flux density from dust emission @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the length along the line of sight .",
    "when @xmath51 , we find @xmath52 .",
    "the fourier transform of the flux density becomes @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath54 is the visibility amplitude and @xmath55 is the uv distance .",
    "figure 4 presents the density profile for p2-sma1 , and p1-sma4 , two of the strongest cores in the clumps .",
    "the visibility is vector averaged over concentric annuli around the center of the core .",
    "the least - squared fit to visibilities yields @xmath56 for p2-sma1 , and @xmath57 for p1-sma4 , if @xmath46 .",
    "the visibility data toward the p1-sma4 have larger scatters due to a limited signal - to - noise ratio , thus the uncertainty to the power - law index is larger than the statistical error quoted here .",
    "the density profiles in both p1 and p2 cores are consistent with a power law relation @xmath48 with @xmath58 between 1.5 to 2 , similar to those found in hot molecular cores @xcite .",
    "such power law structures suggest that these cores may be evolved from an equilibrium state .",
    "a self gravitating core in a hydrostatic equilibrium has a density structure of @xmath59 .",
    "a hydrostatic core truncated by external pressure , @xmath60 , the bonnor - ebert sphere has a similar density structure in the outer radii with a flatter inner profile .",
    "these density structures have been found in low - mass prestellar cores @xcite .",
    "the fact that the more massive cores in the g28 region shows similar structures is rather intriguing , and suggests that cores may evolve slowly to allow them reaching a quasistatic equilibrium state .",
    "this is consistent with the age of the cores inferred from the time scale of chemical depletion .",
    "the early evolutionary stage of the p1 clump makes it an excellent target to study the initial fragmentation in molecular clouds .",
    "the structures revealed by the high resolution sma observations are consistent with a hierarchical fragmentation of molecular clouds .",
    "it appears that the initial fragmentation gives rise to 5 massive cores with masses from 22 to 64  with an average separation of @xmath18 or 0.19 pc .",
    "the cores appear to further fragment as core densities continue to increase .",
    "the average density in the p1 clump based on the iram 30 m telescope is @xmath61 3 . with an average gas temperature in the clump of 16 k",
    ", we find a jeans mass of 1  and a jeans length of 0.05 pc . despite the fact that the sma observations spatially resolve the jeans length ,",
    "the core masses are more than a factor of 10 larger than the thermal jeans mass .",
    "the large discrepancy between the jeans mass and the observed core mass indicates that cloud fragmentation may not be controlled solely by the thermal pressure and gravity .",
    "other stabilizing factors are required to account for the large mass observed .",
    "@xcite reported a systematic decrease in the 3 line width from large scales to small scales of @xmath25 , which can not be attributed to organized motion .",
    "this decrease in line widths is interpreted as a turbulence decay in dense molecular gas .",
    "the observed 3 line width in the p1 cores is 1.7 -1 , a factor of 8 larger than the thermal line width .",
    "this supersonic turbulence likely plays an important role in fragmentation .",
    "the viral masses measured from the 3 line widths are 103 and 24  in p2 and p1 cores , respectively .",
    "the general agreement between the virial mass and gas mass lends support to the notion that turbulence dominates fragmentation .",
    "in addition to turbulence , magnetic fields may also play a role in suppressing fragmentation .",
    "however , without direct measurements of field strengths , it is difficult to assess its importance relative to turbulence .",
    "several theoretical ideas postulate how massive star and cluster formation may begin .",
    "observations find that massive stars and clusters form in higher density and more turbulent regions of molecular clouds as compared to their low mass counterparts .",
    "@xcite propose in the competitive accretion model that clouds fragment initially into cores of jeans mass of @xmath8 0.5 .",
    "these cores subsequently form low - mass protostars that accrete the distributed gas from a reservoir of material in the molecular clump .",
    "prototars located near the center of the gravitational potential accrete at a higher accretion rate because of a stronger gravitational pull , thus , experience a faster mass growth .",
    "this competitive accretion model reproduces the stellar imf observed @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite propose a turbulent accretion model , in which stars form via a monolithic collapse of a molecular cloud .",
    "the heating from the embedded protostars increases the gas temperature , and thus , the jeans mass .",
    "therefore , the core mass function is similar to the stellar imf @xcite .",
    "the observed core masses in p1 appear to be much larger than the core mass assumed in the competitive accretion model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath62 mass sensitivity of 2.5  in this study does not detect the 0.5  jeans cores .",
    "however , the sma observations have a spatial resolution better than the jean length ( 0.05pc ) predicted in the initial fragmentation .",
    "the fact that the core masses are much larger than the jeans mass points to an inconsistency with the theoretical model . in addition",
    ", these cores do not represent transient objects because of the large masses , high average densities @xmath63 3 , and heavy chemical depletion . on the other hand ,",
    "the mechanism of increasing jeans mass through stellar heating proposed by @xcite does not appear to be sufficient . to reach a jeans mass of 30  at a density of @xmath42 3",
    "requires a gas temperature of 100k .",
    "this temperature is a factor of 7 times larger than the gas temperature derived from the 3 emission .",
    "therefore , the increase in temperature is insufficient to stop fragmentation in the p1 region .",
    "the observations indicate that turbulence plays a crucial role in shaping fragmentation in clouds .",
    "it has been suggested that turbulence dissipates rapidly and may not be sufficient to support cores at small scales .",
    "the 3 data from the vla observations @xcite demonstrate that despite turbulence decay , the line widths measured at @xmath25 scales appear to be large enough to support the cores in p1 .",
    "the core mass in the p2 clump is approximately a factor of 2 larger than the core masses in the p1 clump .",
    "it is quite possible that the mass of cores and protostars in the p1 region will grow through infall and become similar to those in the p2 region .",
    "assuming that the cores in p2 is a few @xmath42 yrs , the infall rate required for the core mass growth is a few times @xmath32  yr@xmath14 . such a high infall rate is consistent with expected infall rate @xmath64 , where @xmath65 -1is the turbulent line width , and g is the gravitational constant . the mass accretion to the star , however , is likely to be much smaller as constrained by the low luminosity of @xmath0 .",
    "our observations of the p1 and p2 clumps suggest massive star formation through a low to intermediate mass phase as seen in p1 where masses of cores and protostars continue to grow via infall and accretion .",
    "more observations of similar regions are needed to test this scenario .",
    "we carried out sma observations of two massive clumps p1 and p2 which are at very different evolutionary stages .",
    "the main findings are :    \\(1 ) the p1 clump is resolved into five cores at a projected separation of 0.19 pc , and masses much larger than the jeans mass .",
