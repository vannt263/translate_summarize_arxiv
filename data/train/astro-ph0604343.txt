    "in the first half of the twentieth century the search for and study of variable sources was a major focus of optical astronomy .",
    "this area is widely expected to undergo a renaissance , thanks to significant technological changes ( sensors , computing , storage and dissemination ) .",
    "apart from existing wide - field imagers dedicated facilities such as the panoramic survey telescope &  rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; @xcite ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) are motivated in part to explore transient phenomena in the optical sky .",
    "an excellent precursor of the planned optical searches for transients is the deep lens survey ( dls ) .",
    "this survey is notable for its comprehensive scope and almost real time alerts @xcite , the deep lens survey netted three _ fast _ transients .",
    "the quiescent of the brightest transient was identified with an m dwarf and the transient itself attributed to a flare from the m dwarf .",
    "of the remaining two , the quiescent counterpart of one was spatially extended and the other counterpart coincided with a bright elliptical galaxy ) .",
    "@xcite derive detection rates of 14 , 10 and @xmath0 deg@xmath1 day@xmath2 for transients on timescales of about 1900s in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5-band , respectively .",
    "a byproduct of the 2.2-m mpg / eso survey for orphan afterglow was a search for fast transients over a small piece of sky ( exposure of 0.24deg@xmath6 days ; @xcite ) . from this survey",
    "we derive a 3-@xmath7 upper limit of 28 events deg@xmath1 day@xmath2 for any class of fast transients in the @xmath5 band ( excluding flares from m dwarfs ) , consistent with the dls rate for fast transients .",
    "the two dls fast transients , if real , constitute a new class of extragalactic transients .",
    "the focus of this _ letter _ is the investigation of fast optical transients . here",
    "we report on imaging and spectroscopic observations of the two quiescent counterparts to the two dls fast transients .",
    "the deep lens survey was motivated by considerations of weak lensing . during the period 1999 - 2005 five 2@xmath8 fields",
    "were repeatedly observed on the ctio - blanco &  noao - mayal 4-m telescopes with exposures from 600s to 900s in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath9-bands .",
    "the repeated visits to these fields made the survey attractive to identify fast transients .",
    "@xcite reported the analysis of a transient search based on 14 runs conducted during the period 2000 november and 2003 april .",
    "as with other transient searches these authors found that the largest number of transients were moving solar system objects , followed by variable stars and finally , supernovae ( sne ) .    three fast transients remained after filtering out the above mentioned contaminants .",
    "ot20020115 was detected as a bright source , @xmath3=20.73mag , with a turn - on time of less than 700s .",
    "it faded rapidly following a power law index of 1.5@xmath102.4 .",
    "spectroscopy established this to be a galactic dm4 star , presumably a uv ceti type flare star at a distance of @xmath11350pc .",
    "ot20010326 rose from obscurity to @xmath3=22.7 in less than 700s .",
    "it faded on a timescale of 1000s with @xmath12 . at the position of the transient a compact ( not resolved in an archival hst f606w image ) persistent object with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "was found .",
    "this source resides ( in projection ) on the outskirts of the elliptical galaxy pks1358@xmath1611 , a member of the galaxy cluster a1836 at @xmath17 .",
    "if ot20010326 does lie in a1836 then the quiescent counterpart could be a bright globular cluster associated with pks1358@xmath1611 or a faint galaxian member of a1836 .",
    "radio observations were conducted four days later resulting in a limit of @xmath18mjy in the 8.5-ghz band .",
    "ot20030305 rose in less than 700s and then doubled in flux in less than 700s to @xmath19mag .",
    "the transient dropped by 1.5mag over the next 700s , and was found to brighten again in the @xmath3-band by 0.5mag where it remained nearly constant for at least 1000s .",
    "a post - cursor was detected at @xmath5@xmath1124.6 and @xmath20mag .",
    "@xcite claimed an apparent ellipticity of the post - cursor .",
    "if so , it is tempting to associate the quiescent object to be a distant galaxy .    if the extragalactic nature of ot20010326 and ot20030305 could be established then astronomers have uncovered a new class of explosive transients with a staggering combined annual all - sky rate of @xmath21 .",
    "the red color of the putative host galaxies would mean that the progenitors belong to the old population ( cf .",
    "novae , short hard bursts , supernovae of type ia ) as opposed to long duration grbs which arise only in young populations .",
    "an annual all - sky rate of fast transients , @xmath22 of @xmath23 means three events per second .",
    "the best way to appreciate the potential importance of the dls candidates is the comparison of this rate with the local ( @xmath24 ) rates of known transients ( see table  [ tab : rates ] ) .",
    ".local ( z=0 ) rates of known transients .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : log ]      owing to the faintness ( @xmath5@xmath1123.3 ) and red color ( @xmath25mag ) the blue channel ( @xmath26 ) spectrum is of little value .",
    "the red channel spectrum shows strong absorption features which we identify with tio and cah bands ( figure  [ fig : ot0326 ] )",
    ". a narrow emission feature close to the h@xmath27 wavelength is detected .",
    "we identify this with h@xmath27 .",
    "the line is unresolved with a full width at half maximum ( 7@xmath282 ) consistent with the instrumental line width .",
    "the centroid is blue shifted with respect to the local standard rest frame by @xmath29 .",
    "the measured h@xmath27 line flux is @xmath30 .",
    "we undertook deep observations of this source .",
    "the red spectrum shows a strong emission feature which we identify with h@xmath27 ( figure  [ fig : ot0305 ] ) .",
    "fortified with the h@xmath27 detection we were also able to detect h@xmath31 emission in the blue part of the spectrum ( figure  [ fig : ot0305 ] , middle and right panels ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the h@xmath27 line is @xmath32 , comparable to the instrumental resolution .",
    "the line centroid corresponds to a velocity with respect to the local standard rest frame of @xmath33 .",
    "the h@xmath27 and h@xmath31 line fluxes were measured as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the imaging data were calibrated with respect to the dls source catalog and verified using the colors of stars in the field compared to colors derived from the synthetic stellar spectra included in the library of @xcite .",
    "the quiescent counterpart was not detected in the @xmath3-band down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath36mag but detected in the redder bands with @xmath37mag and @xmath38mag .",
    "as the seeing was moderate during our observations and the imaging data suffered from additional instrumental distortions , we are unable to confirm ( or disprove ) the claimed ellipticity of the source .",
    "in the deep lens survey transient search three fast transients with rise or fall time of @xmath111000s were discovered .",
    "surprisingly all three were detected in the @xmath3-band and none were seen in the @xmath5-band .",
    "similarly , all three events had quiescent red counterparts .",
    "@xcite performed subsequent spectroscopic follow - up observations of the brightest transient and identified it as a flare from a galactic m dwarf .",
    "here we reported keck spectroscopic and imaging observations of the quiescent counterparts of the remaining two events .",
    "the spectrum of ot20010326 shows strong tio absorption band heads and is thus an m star .",
    "the spectrum of ot20030305 shows h@xmath27 and h@xmath31 emission lines and is consistent with a galactic origin ( no significant local standard rest frame velocity ) .",
    "the emission lines and the red color of the quiescent counterpart are best interpreted as arising from a galactic m dwarf .    assuming a distance of about 1kpc for the ot20030305 and ot20010326 ( based on their apparent @xmath5 magnitude ) the flare energy release is @xmath39erg .",
    "this is comparable to the energy release from the uv - ceti variable yy gem @xcite .",
    "however as ( reasonably ) pointed by @xcite one expects that high - altitude ( @xmath40 ) m dwarfs are not expected to possess strong activity ( owing to their older age ) .",
    "it may well be that a fraction of late type dwarfs retain activity for a longer period .",
    "alternatively , the late type counterparts discussed here may have had activity induced later in their life .",
    "indeed we know of several classes of detached binaries belonging to the old population and which are active ( e.g. , rs cvn ; @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that the quiescent dls counterparts are rapidly spinning owing to binarity ( driven by a close - in planet or a brown dwarf companion ) .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral resolution of our lris spectrum pose no significant constraint on the rotation period : the full width at half maximum merely constrain the rotation period to be larger than the breakup period .    the key conclusion of our paper",
    "is that it is now clear that all the fast transients found by the dls are flares from galactic m dwarfs .",
    "the fast transient annual rate in @xmath3 band ( obtained by using the sky exposure and transient detection efficiency given in @xcite ) is @xmath41 .",
    "the impressive value of @xmath42 , relative to any known category of extragalactic transients (  [ sec : interesting ] ) , means that the `` foreground fog '' of flares will ensure that the false positives outnumber genuine extragalactic events by at least two orders of magnitude .    indeed",
    ", current searches even with modest coverage are already facing a steady drizzle of interlopers . noting the tendency of astronomers to report all unusual transients as candidate grb",
    "afterglows we scoured the grb literature .",
    "a large flare in the localization of the gamma - ray burst gb 7810006b turns out to be a dme star @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a source brightening to @xmath43mag in the ipn localization of grb 001212 ; the quiescent counterpart was later identified with a 2mass m dwarf @xcite . during the course of the catalina survey for near earth asteroids @xcite identified a fast transient source ( fading from @xmath44 to 19.7mag in 1 hr ) in lynx and later spectroscopically established to be an m dwarf @xcite .",
    "the fast transient found in the cfht legacy survey @xcite was later identified with a 2mass counterpart , likely a m dwarf @xcite .",
    "consider a specific example of a survey undertaken by a telescope with field of view , @xmath45 ( in steradians ) .",
    "let @xmath46 be the exposure time per field of view ( frame time , usually between 30s and 300s ) .",
    "the number of flares per frame is thus @xmath47 and the number over a time @xmath48 is @xmath49 . for @xmath50steradian ( corresponding to 10 square degrees ) and @xmath51yr ( a year s worth of observing ) we find @xmath52 .    how can this immense fog of m dwarf flares be penetrated ?",
    "spectroscopy of the quiescent counterparts would require significant amount of time on large telescopes and is thus not a feasible approach .",
    "a counterpart which has spatial extent may simply be due to an asterism or a gaseous nebula formed by repeated flares .",
    "an attractive locale such as a bright galaxy or a cluster of galaxies ( cf .",
    "ot20010326 ) does not necessarily imply extragalactic origin .",
    "finally , those transients which lie in unfavorable regions ( close to a diffraction spike , close to a bright object ) would have poorer photometry and errors may conspire to make the transient appear more interesting . indeed , it is only transients with such interesting coincidences or properties that will inevitably lure the hapless observer into a web of incorrect conclusions .    the best line of defense is to take advantage of the blue ( uv ) color of flares . on detection of a potential fast transient follow - up observations in a band ( or two ) complementary to the discovery band should be undertaken and the color(s ) thus used to discriminate against the m dwarfs .",
    "the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody has a distinctly different spectrum ( @xmath53 ) as opposed to say a synchrotron radiation ( @xmath54 with @xmath55 ) .",
    "needless to say these observations should be done whilst the flare is in progress i.e. on timescales of 100s or so .",
    "we close this paper with two observations .",
    "first , pan - starrs and lsst have a multitude of science goals .",
    "discovering new classes of fast transients is only one of them . from the work of @xcite and the work presented here it is now abundantly clear that flares from late type stars constitute a veritable foreground fog",
    "surveys have to be tuned to minimize the fog : judicious choice of directions ( high galactic and ecliptic latitude ) , careful choice of the primary search ( optical ) filter , limiting the target fields so that ( over time ) m dwarfs in those fields are identified , undertaking a pre - search survey designed to identify suspect late type dwarfs ( e.g. deep @xmath56 band observations during bright time ) and/or a well planned rapid followup strategy with complementary filters may be more successful than multi - purpose surveys .",
    "next , we note that the ot_yyyymmdd _ designation is y2k compliant and thus represents a slight improvement over the present grb naming convention .",
    "optical astronomers have the opportunity to continue the ( quixotic and impractical ) grb and sn convention of appending a , b , c , ... , aa and so on ( for successive events ) but , given the measured rate of flares from m dwarfs of @xmath23 , face the risk of drowning in a blizzard of alphabets .",
    "we thank a. becker and p. boeshaar for constructive feedback and s. djorgovski for reminding us of the lynx transient which then led us to search the gcn literature for other examples of m dwarf flares .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with m.  della valle , e.  ofek , e.  s.  phinney , p.  price , e.  priest , m.  salvato &   e.  scannapieco .",
