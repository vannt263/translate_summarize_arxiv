    "the rotation speed of the milky way , , at the distance of the sun from its center , , is a fundamental parameter for both galactic and local group dynamics .",
    "the value of  is needed to convert velocities from the observed heliocentric frame to a galactocentric frame , and it is key to estimating the mass of the milky way .",
    "one can find estimates of   ranging from about 170 to 270  in the literature over the past several decades . in 1985 ,",
    "the iau recommended @xmath1   @xcite , in part based on a particularly compelling analysis by @xcite ( hereafter , gkt ) of the maximum observed velocity of  emission as a function of galactic longitude measured in the inner milky way .",
    "recent measurements of large numbers of trigonometric parallaxes for masers associated with high - mass star forming regions with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) have provided full 3-dimensional velocities along with `` gold standard '' distances to sources across large portions of the milky way @xcite .",
    "modeling the most recent data suggests a value of  of @xmath2   @xcite , significantly greater than the iau recommendation .",
    "independently , the _ apparent _ motion of , assumed to be the reflex of the solar orbit about the galactic center , yields a similar value for , provided @xmath3 kpc @xcite .    of course , other estimates of  can be found in the recent literature in particular , @xcite argue for @xmath4 , coupled with a very large value of the sun s peculiar motion in the direction of galactic rotation of @xmath5 .",
    "( @xmath6   is used to define local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocities . )",
    "however , adopting a larger value for  would not relieve the tension between the   estimate of @xmath1  and the vlbi parallax and proper motion estimate of @xmath0 , since it would lower both estimates .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the method of estimating  from  emission spectra in order to resolve this tension .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : gkt_fig1 ] , we reproduce the plot of the maximum lsr velocity of  emission as a function of the sine of the galactic longitude , @xmath7 , from gkt . for",
    "any given longitude , the maximum positive velocity in the first quadrant ( and maximum negative velocity in the fourth quadrant ) should occur at the tangent point . along a ray from the sun at any longitude",
    ", the tangent point is the closest point to the galactic center , and at this point the observed lsr velocity is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the circular rotation speed at the tangent point radius from the galactic center , @xmath10 .",
    "gkt show traces of the magnitude of the maximum  velocity , , in the first and fourth galactic quadrants .",
    "they fitted a straight line to the first quadrant trace over the range @xmath11 , yielding @xmath12 .",
    "note that at the tangent point for @xmath13 , radii are @xmath14 kpc and one expects significant non - circular motions for gas in the vicinity of the galactic bar .",
    "the slope of the fitted line gives a direct estimate of , provided the rotation curve of the milky way is flat between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "gkt give a formal error on the slope of 3 , but add that a realistic uncertainty is 10 , reflecting the possibility of a slight slope in the rotation curve .",
    "in particular , for a power - law form of the rotation curve , they rule out the possibility of @xmath0 , as it would require a rising rotation curve with an unrealistically large @xmath17 .    over the years",
    "there has been discussion in the literature of the methods used to estimate  from  spectra .",
    "gkt define   as the extreme velocity of emission brighter than 1.0 k , and treat the non - zero intercept ( 28 ) as owing to turbulent broadening . of course , this value is sensitive to the method of estimating .",
    "@xcite point out that  absorption against continuum emission from  regions can affect estimates of , favoring interferometric spectra with high angular resolution , which allow editing of absorbed spectra . also , instead of using a simple brightness threshold",
    ", they fit multiple components to the spectra to estimate .",
    "however , while these improvements suggest a slightly rising rotation curve , their estimates of  still fall well below 240 , whether using the  method ( see their fig .",
    "7 ) or re - scaling the forms of the well - cited rotation curves of @xcite or @xcite ( see their fig . 8) .",
    "vlbi parallaxes and proper motions , from the bar and spiral structure legacy ( bessel ) survey and the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) observations of molecular masers associated with high - mass star forming regions , should be excellent tracers of galactic dynamics .",
    "eighty sources from the combined surveys were modeled with varous forms for the rotation curve by @xcite .",
    "the best fitting model , shown in fig .  [ fig : univ ] , used a `` universal '' rotation curve of @xcite .",
    "this formulation is well motivated by observations of large numbers of spiral galaxies .",
    "( specifically , the curve is for an @xmath18 galaxy ( @xmath19 ) , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 kpc . )",
    "note that the fitted universal rotation curve is nearly flat between about 5.5 and 8.0 kpc , but curves downward inside of 5.5 kpc . at 4.2 kpc ( @xmath23 )",
    "the rotation speed is 228 , it peaks at 241   at 7.2 kpc , and it declines very slightly to 240  just past  ( assumed to be 8.34 kpc ) .    as fig .",
    "[ fig : hi ] shows ,  predicted by the universal rotation curve matches the highest velocity of  emission very well over most of the inner milky way , and at @xmath24 it provides a much better fit than for flat rotation curves with  of 220 or 240 .",
    "however , note that over the longitude range fitted by gkt ( @xmath11 ) , the universal curve is roughly linear in   and can be approximated by a flat curve of 220 .",
    "_ this holds even though the universal rotation curve has a circular velocity of 240 at the solar radius and an average velocity of 238  over the fitted range .",
    "_    to further demonstrate this point , in fig .",
    "[ fig : tp_univ ] we fit  predicted by the universal curve with a straight line over the gkt range of @xmath25 and find a slope of 224 , consistent with the gkt result .",
    "alternatively , simply defining a straight line by the rotation curve values at the endpoints of their fitting range yields a similar value of 220 .",
    "we conclude that a rotation curve that rises from 228  at 4.2 kpc to 241  at 7.2 kpc and then flattens , as does the universal rotation curve fitted to the vlbi data , gives a biased estimate of  that is low by about 20 , when fitting a straight line to tangent - point velocities between radii of @xmath15 and .",
    "this resolves the apparent tension between the two methods of estimating  and favors a value of 240 .",
