    "* ) and have used qso spectroscopy of various rest - frame ultraviolet transitions to constrain the nature of baryonic processes in the outer regions of galaxies , e.g. , feedback , accretion , and cooling @xcite .",
    "these transitions include ly@xmath9  and lines that probe cooler , photoionized gas @xcite , and and doublets that trace warmer , more diffuse material @xcite .",
    "however , while the apparent brightness of qsos enables high signal - to - noise , high spectral resolution datasets , they severely outshine the galaxies projected nearby and therefore limit follow - up analysis , especially at small impact parameters .",

    "the three - dimensional cosmological simulations of @xcite show that even in halos well above the  transition \" mass ( @xmath131 ) , in which hot , virialized atmospheres develop via shock - heating during gas accretion , cold filaments of gas from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can penetrate deep into the hot halo . at high redshifts ( @xmath132 ) , these cold flows reach the central galaxy and fuel star formation . at @xmath133 , in the case of a @xmath134 halo , the filaments penetrate to only half the virial radius , but can fragment into dense , cold clouds via shocks , cooling instabilities , or other mechanisms . as these clouds are virialized within the halo , they will acquire a large velocity dispersion and produce a large @xmath135 , as discussed above .",
    "however , we do not consider cold inflow from the igm to be the most likely origin of the cool halo gas we observe .",
    "first , our detection of @xmath136    @xmath4 halo absorption and @xmath137    k halo absorption in this system ( as noted in  [ sec.thepair ] ; see also figure  [ fig.fgspecstamps ] and table  [ tab.ew ] ) may indicate that the absorbing gas is enriched with metals and dust .",
    "we can not measure the metallicity or dust content of this system directly , as we lack the necessary spectral coverage .",
    "however , strong absorption systems in the redshift range @xmath138 have been shown to significantly redden background qsos @xcite ; furthermore , the degree of reddening increases with @xmath135 .",
    "@xcite find that for absorbers with @xmath139   at @xmath51 , the mean rest - frame @xmath140 ( see their equation 18 ) .",
    "they also find that absorbers with @xmath56   have an average dust - to - metals ratio close to those measured in the milky way ism .",
    "similar results for the mean dust - to - metals ratio of strong absorbers have been reported by @xcite , who additionally show that dust content increases with larger @xmath60 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as noted above , the absorption we observe has an @xmath60 value as large as the strongest absorbers in these studies .",
    "these findings suggest that there may be a substantial amount of dust in this system .",
    "second , we do not resolve individual gas clouds because of our low spectral resolution ( @xmath141 ) ; however , we note that the absorption line profiles in figure  [ fig.fgspecstamps ] exhibit asymmetry .",
    "@xcite find that cool gas clouds distributed such that the gas density is proportional to the total matter density in an isothermal spherical halo tend to produce a symmetric velocity profile , although this depends on the number of absorbing clouds in the halo and the particular sightline observed .",
    "both the likely high dust content of the absorption system and the line profile asymmetry suggest an alternate origin for the observed cool gas .",
    "we next consider whether the observed halo gas could have plausibly originated in the ism of the host galaxy or progenitor galaxies which was ejected during a previous starburst , merger or luminous agn phase .",
    "if this phase occurred @xmath137 gyr ago ( as is likely ; see  [ sec.psb_scenario ] ) , cool outflows would have had to reach speeds of only @xmath142 to reach a projected distance of @xmath3 kpc today , where @xmath143 is the angle between the plane of the sky and the path taken by the gas .",
    "cool outflows commonly reach speeds in excess of @xmath144 in starburst galaxies @xcite and have even been observed in post - starburst galaxies at intermediate redshifts @xcite .",
    "cool gas which has been tidally stripped from the progenitor galaxies of this merger remnant may also give rise to enriched halo absorption with large @xmath54 , provided that the velocity spread in the stripped clouds is large enough @xcite .",
    "the magellanic stream , for instance , has a velocity dispersion of @xmath145 @xcite , and so could not produce the observed @xmath54 in the absence of other clouds .",
    "additionally , anisotropic ejection of gas clouds or tidal streams could easily produce asymmetric absorption line profiles .",
    "we conclude that cool ism which was driven or stripped out of the galactic star - forming regions during a past starburst , merger or agn phase is a plausible origin for this gas . if in reality the gas originated in a cold inflow or halo condensation as discussed in ",
    "[ sec.multiphase ] , our finding that the galaxy experienced a starburst @xmath137 gyr ago is simply a coincidence , and is not necessarily related to the observed absorbing gas .",
    "we note that it is unlikely that there is ongoing expulsion of ism , as there is little current star formation activity in the galaxy , and the observed agn activity is weak .",
    "therefore , in this scenario , once the cool gas was ejected or stripped , it is likely to have remained cold for approximately 1 gyr , i.e. , since the starburst activity .",
    "the analysis of @xcite suggests that ejected _ hot _ gas could not have cooled through condensation , although again , the assumptions made in that analysis may not apply in this case .",
    "cool gas clouds ejected or stripped from the ism and moving through a hot medium may be subject to the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "@xcite showed that such disturbances on the surface of a cloud can not completely disrupt the cloud unless its cooling time is longer than its sound crossing time .",
    "following @xcite , we assume an isothermal halo with temperature @xmath146 and with gas density profile @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the cosmic baryon fraction @xcite , and @xmath149 is the maximum rotation velocity of the halo ( equal to the virial velocity in this case ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we assume that the cool clouds are at @xmath150 and that they immediately come into pressure equilibrium with the surrounding hot gas as soon as they enter the halo .",
    "the sound crossing time for a cloud is given by the ratio of the cloud radius to the cloud sound speed ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "to calculate the cooling time of the cloud , we use equation 33 from @xcite .",
    "we find that the sound crossing time exceeds the cooling time by at least one order of magnitude for clouds with masses @xmath152 out to the halo virial radius ( @xmath153 kpc ) .",
    "we expect that these clouds will be stable against the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "we also note that the clouds at the upper end of this mass range are evaporated by conduction on timescales of @xmath154 gyr , where the evaporation timescale is given by equation 35 in @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the hot gas profile does not change substantially with time , we can conclude that cold clouds driven into the halo from the ism during a starburst or merger occurring @xmath137 gyr ago should remain cold today , and indeed for at least 1 gyr more .",
    "outflow during the past starburst , merger or luminous agn event may have been powered by a variety of mechanisms . the galaxy evolution model advocated by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) suggests that in a gas rich major merger gas is driven to the center of the galaxies once they have coalesced , fueling powerful starburst activity and black hole growth and igniting a luminous qso .",
    "feedback from supernovae explosions is well known to drive outflows in starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and could have contributed all of the power needed to accelerate the cool ism to velocities of @xmath155 .",
    "simulations of major mergers @xcite show that they can generate a shock - heated gas wind , possibly forcing cool gas into the halo .",
    "in addition , gas from the ism that was tidally stripped during a merger event may have been left behind at large impact parameters .",
    "finally , a luminous agn could have contributed to driving cool gas into the galactic halo and to the quenching of star formation . in the @xcite scenario , the phase in which the remaining ism material is blown away and the qso is revealed is expected to occur within a few hundred myr of the merger itself .",
    "the phase in which the qso has faded and the merger remnant reddens and exhibits a post - starburst stellar continuum occurs @xmath156 after the merger . our results on the star formation history , colors , and morphology of this galaxy fit well into this scenario .",
    "however , we note that we have the strongest evidence that the galaxy is post - starburst ; the occurrence of a quasar phase is purely speculative .",
    "we also consider whether clouds ejected from the ism would have a large spread in velocities of @xmath157 1 gyr after the starburst event has ceased . to determine this",
    ", we construct a toy model of the behavior of the outflowing gas inside the halo potential . to start , we follow @xcite and assume that the velocity ( @xmath158 ) of the outflowing gas as a function of distance from the starburst region ( @xmath159 ) is given by @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the halo velocity dispersion , @xmath162 is the lower limit on the starburst luminosity needed to expel a large fraction of the galaxy s gas when it is optically thick , and @xmath163 is the initial radius of the outflow .",
    "this equation applies until the terminal velocity is reached , @xmath164 . for @xmath165 , @xmath166 kpc and @xmath167 ,",
    "the gas is driven to radii of @xmath168 kpc during a 100 myr - long starburst .",
    "the results are insensitive to the choice of @xmath169 as long as @xmath170 ; however , @xmath171 and @xmath163 must have values such that the gas does not fall back onto the galaxy in 1 gyr .",
    "if @xmath166 kpc , values of @xmath172 are viable ; if @xmath163 is doubled , slightly lower values of @xmath173 yield cloud distances and velocities high enough so that they remain in the halo for the necessary amount of time .",
    "we then assume that the starburst ends abruptly , and that the clouds from the wind are now subject only to the gravitational potential of the halo , and neglect the effect of drag forces from the surrounding hot halo gas . by integrating the equations of motion for clouds with distances @xmath174 kpc and with initial velocities given by the above equation for @xmath158",
    ", we calculate the final positions and velocities after 1 gyr .",
    "a bipolar geometry for the outflow with an opening angle of @xmath175 is assumed , consistent with measurements of the opening angle of the outflow cones traced by h@xmath9 and co emission in m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that our line of sight intersects both outflow cones and is parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the cones .",
    "we calculate the line - of - sight velocities for the clouds that are at a projected distance of @xmath176 kpc after 1 and 2 gyr .",
    "the velocity spread is well above @xmath177 at both time increments .",
    "while this model is quite rudimentary , it indicates that clouds driven out of a galaxy 1 gyr ago may have the large velocity dispersion that is observed , and that they will maintain this large dispersion for at least another 1 gyr .    from all of the evidence discussed above",
    ", we conclude that the absorption system is most likely gaseous fragments of the ism from the merger remnant we observe .",
    "this gas may have been ejected by a wind driven by a starburst , merger , or agn , or tidally stripped from the progenitor galaxies .",
    "if indeed these clouds originated in the ism , this is one of the first measurements of the radial extent of such outflows or tidally stripped gas in the distant universe and suggests that it reaches far beyond the stellar disk . because the clouds we observe are likely dusty ( see  [ sec.multiphase ] ) , this mechanism may be responsible for distributing the diffuse dust detected in galaxy halos to projected separations much larger than the scales of galactic disks @xcite .      a complementary method which has recently been used to study the host galaxies of absorption systems measures the clustering strength of a large sample of absorbers with respect to that of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , to determine the mean halo masses in which absorbers of varying strengths are found .",
    "these studies have shown that there is a weak anticorrelation between @xmath135 and the bias of systems at @xmath179 .",
    "this has been interpreted as an anticorrelation with mean absorber halo mass , significant at the 1@xmath70 level ; i.e. , absorbers with 1.0   @xmath180 1.5   have mean halo mass @xmath181 , while @xmath182 absorbers have mean halo mass @xmath183 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the number of @xmath184   absorbers in these studies is relatively small ; however , the @xmath185 we infer for our foreground absorber , while higher than the mean halo mass of strong absorbers quoted above , is well within the uncertainties in the estimates of the mean halo masses for _ both _ weak and strong absorbers ( see figure 7c , * ? ? ?",
    "one explanation proposed by @xcite for the origin of strong absorbers suggests that cool gas is driven into galaxy halos via starburst - driven winds .",
    "these authors propose that winds are more likely to remove gas from galactic disks in shallower potential wells , and therefore expect strong absorbers to be preferentially found in lower - mass halos .",
    "@xcite show , however , that the clustering of strong absorbers is _ unbiased _ with respect to dark matter halos and thus strong absorption does not occur preferentially at low masses .",
    "furthermore , the present study provides one example of strong absorption which is most likely due to past outflow or merger activity in a high mass ( @xmath186 ) halo .",
    "our result implies that while galactic winds may be an important source of cool halo gas , they should not necessarily be the dominant contributor in only low mass halos , and indeed _ must _ not occur preferentially in lower mass halos if they are to fully explain the bias results of @xcite .",
    "an alternative picture is inspired by simulations of , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , which provide evidence for the  transition \" halo mass , above which cold gas is shock heated as it is accreted onto a halo as discussed in ",
    "[ sec.multiphase ] .",
    "@xcite find that an anticorrelation between @xmath125 and @xmath135 , as well as the observed frequency distribution of absorbers , can be reproduced in a halo occupation model which includes such a transition mass , so that the most massive halos are mostly too hot to produce large @xmath54 while lower mass halos contain more cool gas and can give rise to high @xmath54 systems .",
    "as shown in @xcite , cold flows can partially penetrate through the hot gas in massive halos at @xmath187 and form cold clouds , which may even then fuel further star formation . while our galaxy is unusual in that it is post - starburst , the existence of an _ enriched _",
    "@xmath188   system in a halo with a mass well above the  transition mass \" is consistent with this picture , and if the observed gas originated in an outflow , implies that ( 1 ) the effects of star formation on halo gas are observed well into the mass regime in which hot gas accretion dominates the total gas accretion , or ( 2 ) there is a spread in transition mass for different galaxy halos .",
    "using multiwavelength analysis of the luminous components of a galaxy at @xmath0 in concert with spectroscopy of a bright , close transverse background galaxy at @xmath2 , we demonstrate that the cool gas traced by absorption in the foreground galaxy halo at impact parameter @xmath189 kpc most likely originated in the ism of the host galaxy or its progenitors .",
    "this galaxy has little ongoing star formation and exhibits only weak agn activity ; however , it experienced a starburst @xmath137 gyr ago , which may have been triggered by a merger event .",
    "the cool halo gas could have easily been driven or stripped away from the star - forming regions during this past violent phase , and could have survived in the hot halo since that time . our rudimentary toy model for the motions of clouds driven into the halo by a past",
    "starburst suggests that these clouds would have a large velocity dispersion @xmath190 today , consistent with our observations .",
    "we emphasize that the analysis of the luminous components of this galaxy achieves an unprecedented level of detail in the context of studies of distant absorption - selected galaxies with @xmath191  .",
    "such detail is possible because of the rich dataset available in goods , including the galaxy redshifts from tkrs @xcite and our lris spectroscopy .",
    "we were able to identify the post - starburst and age - date it using this dataset ; previous works could not necessarily find such a galaxy , and thus present a less complete view of the host galaxies of strong absorbers .",
    "@xcite searched for @xmath87 emission near @xmath192 absorbers at @xmath133 to investigate a starburst origin for absorption ; this method can not be used to identify host galaxies without @xmath87 emission , such as post - starbursts with weak agn activity .",
    "@xcite investigated environments of @xmath193 absorbers by imaging the corresponding qso fields ; however , they lacked spectroscopic confirmation of galaxy - absorber associations and have not constrained the star formation history of absorber hosts .",
    "our study only begins to demonstrate the power of using background galaxies to probe foreground halo gas .",
    "several large spectroscopic surveys have recently concluded or are nearing completion that can be used to identify pairs suitable for a targeted search for foreground absorption .",
    "spectroscopic followup with an instrument such as lris requires that the background source be bright and blue so that a continuum signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath194 at @xmath195   can be acquired in a reasonable exposure time ( i.e. , @xmath196 in less than 4 hours ) .",
    "this @xmath197 is needed to achieve a @xmath198 ew detection limit of 0.5   for a absorber at @xmath179 .",
    "there are @xmath199 galaxy pairs with redshifts measured as part of the deep2 survey of the extended groth strip ( egs ) with angular separations @xmath200 @xcite which meet these requirements .",
    "surveys such as combo-17 @xcite and zcosmos @xcite will provide pair candidates in numbers on the same order as deep2 , as will the forthcoming vimos vlt surveys @xcite .",

    "the pan - starrs survey , which will image 1200 square degrees in 4 filters to @xmath201 , will provide an unprecedented number of photometric redshifts . using the average sampling rate and the average redshift success rate of the egs portion of the deep2 survey @xcite to scale the number of pair candidates to that expected from a photometric survey , and additionally scaling by the 2400-fold increase in sky coverage with pan - starrs",
    ", we expect that @xmath202 galaxy pairs will be available for spectroscopic followup .",
    "the use of galaxies as background probes is complementary to analysis of grb sightlines , which have a negligible beam size but similarly allow for close analysis of the absorber host @xcite . in good seeing conditions and with extended background galaxies ,",
    "one may probe multiple sightlines through a given foreground halo .",
    "size scales smaller than @xmath203 kpc at @xmath204 are not currently accessible because of seeing limitations .",
