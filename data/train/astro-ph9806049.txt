    "the black hole binary gro j1655 - 40 is one of the rare galactic x - ray sources ( along with grs1915 + 105 and possibly cyg x-3 ) known to produce relativistic radio jets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . these jet sources , and a few other galactic x - ray sources that exhibit double - lobed radio structure ( e.g. 1e1740.7 - 2942 ; see @xcite and references therein ) , are collectively referred to as `` microquasars '' , since they have properties analogous to radio - loud active galactic nuclei .",
    "investigations of microquasars provide opportunities to search for the cause of relativistic jets , to probe the properties of accreting black holes and their mass - donor companion stars , and to measure the spectral evolution associated with the various accretion states .",
    "gro j1655 - 40 is an especially important target for such studies , since its distance and black hole mass are well established : @xmath6 3.2 kpc has been inferred from radio absorption features ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and @xmath7  has been derived from optical investigations of the binary system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gro j1655 - 40 , was discovered with batse on 1994 july 27 . for about four months thereafter a correlation between hard x - ray outbursts ( 20100 kev ) and radio flares",
    "was observed , and this established a relationship between jet formation and hard x - ray activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , subsequently during 199495 the hard x - ray outbursts continued unabated while the radio responses decreased ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus jet formation in gro j1655 - 40 depends on some unknown factor(s ) in addition to hard x - ray outbursts .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of gro j1655 - 40 has been detected with osse to photon energies above 1 mev ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . above 50 kev ,",
    "the spectrum is consistent with a power law function and a photon index in the range of 2.42.8 .",
    "soft x - ray observations were made with rosat during 1994 august ( @xcite ) and with asca during 1994 august  september and 1995 august ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detected flux ( 210 kev ) was in the range of 0.24.7@xmath8 erg @xmath9 ps . with a suggestion of persistence in soft x - rays during the times between hard x - ray outbursts . below 10 kev ,",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a component which is attributed to thermal emission from the inner accretion disk .",
    "spectral fits for this thermal x - ray component indicate that the size of the inner disk in gro j1655 - 40 appears to be relatively small and hot , compared to the disks of other black hole binaries .",
    "a nonrotating 7  black hole would be expected to have an inner disk larger than the innermost stable orbit of 6 @xmath10 or 62 km , while a rapidly rotating ( prograde ) black hole may have a last stable orbit as small as 1 @xmath10 or 10 km ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gro j1655 - 40 appears to have an inner disk radius of 22 km or 2.1 @xmath11 ( @xcite ) , which was interpreted as evidence that the black hole is rotating at @xmath1293% of the maximum rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "such rapid rotation may be the distinguishing characteristic of the microquasars .    during late 1995 and early 1996 , gro j1655 - 40 entered a very low or quiescent accretion state ( e.g. @xcite ) , permitting a clear optical view of the companion star .",
    "this allowed orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) to improve the determinations of the binary period ( 2.62 d ) , the mass function ( 3.2 ) , and the spectral type of the secondary ( f4iv ) .",
    "they further modeled the `` ellipsoidal variations '' of the secondary star and partial eclipses of the accretion disk .",
    "their analysis , using b , v , r , and i bandpasses , provides an exceptionally good fit for the binary inclination angle ( @xmath13 ) and the mass ratio . from these results , they deduce masses of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the black hole and companion star , respectively ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "this is the only microquasar for which there is a clear understanding of the masses and dimensions of the binary system .",
    "the all sky monitor ( asm ) aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) began regular monitoring of the x - ray sky at 212 kev in early 1996 .",
    "for the first two months of asm observations , the source was quiescent and not detected .",
    "then , on 1996 april 25 a new outburst was discovered ( @xcite ) . with great fortune ,",
    "concurrent optical monitoring was in progress , and it was determined that optical brightening preceded the x - ray turn - on by 6 days , beginning first in the i band and then occurring sequentially in the r , v , and b bands ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results provide evidence favoring a two - zone accretion flow in quiescent x - ray novae : a cold outer disk and an extremely hot inner disk with an advection - dominated accretion flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "herein we report the results of x - ray timing investigations derived from a series of 52 rxte pointed observations of gro j1655 - 40 covering the 19961997 outburst . a brief and preliminary account of these results",
    "has been reported previously ( @xcite ) .",
    "we describe four types of transient quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in x - rays that span 0.1 to 300 hz .",
    "three of these qpo types appear only when the luminosity of the hard power - law component is high .",
    "moreover , the 300 hz qpo is seen only when the power - law component dominates the spectrum , and the total x - ray luminosity exceeds @xmath121015% of the eddingtom limit ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this fast qpo appears to be analogous to the stationary 67 hz qpo seen in grs1915 + 105 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rxte asm scans the celestial sphere roughly five times per day .",
    "each of its three cameras contains a position - sensitive proportional counter that is mounted below a coded mask .",
    "the typical sensitivity for measurements averaged over one day is @xmath17 mcrab at 3 @xmath18 significance over the full energy range of the instrument .",
    "data in the form of position histograms are accumulated in three energy channels : 1.53.0 , 35 , and 512 kev .",
    "the mask shadow patterns are deconvolved to yield x - ray source intensities , which are then normalized to the response characteristics of camera # 1 .",
    "further details regarding the instrument and data analysis methods are described by @xcite ( 1996 ) .",
    "the asm light curve for gro j1655 - 40 is shown in figure [ fig : asm ] .",
    "these data have been renormalized via the instrument calibrations that were revised on 1998 march 15 .",
    "the top panel displays the x - ray count rate at 212 kev ; the vertical lines above the data points indicate the times of rxte pointed observations which are of central importance to this paper . as shown below in section 4 ,",
    "the hard x - ray component is usually sufficiently steep that the 212 kev count rate is a fairly good representation of the overall x - ray luminosity .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : asm ] shows measurements of the spectral hardness ratio , _",
    "hr2 _ , which is defined as the asm count rate at 512 kev relative to the rate at 35 kev .",
    "the overall profile of this outburst is markedly different from the fast rise and slow exponential decay characteristic of many x - ray novae ( @xcite ) . in the case of gro j1655 - 40",
    ", the first wave in x - ray brightness lasts for about 270 days .",
    "initially the source is in a soft state , but then it evolves into a hard , flaring state . the highest flux during these flares ( 285 c / s ) corresponds to an x - ray luminosity ( unabsorbed ) near @xmath19 erg s@xmath5 at 212 kev , which is @xmath120.2 @xmath16 for gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "the isolated low points in the asm light curve have been shown to be associated with absorption dips that occur in a narrow range of binary phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "after mjd 50400 , the x - ray flux decreases while the spectrum softens , reaching a local minimum near mjd 50460",
    ". however , this evolution is interrupted by a second wave in brightness that extends the outburst for another 200 days .",
    "the second maximum also displays an interval of increased variability and spectral hardening .",
    "however , compared to the first maximum , the intensity is substantially lower and the flaring is subdued . the decay from the second maximum",
    "is again associated with spectral softening .",
    "however beginning at mjd 50670 ( 1997 august 10 ) , at a count rate of 12 c / s ( or only 0.008 @xmath16 ) , the spectrum abruptly hardens again .",
    "the flux continues to decay , and on mjd 50681 ( 1997 august 21 ) the source falls below the asm detection limit ( 3@xmath18 upper limits @xmath129 mcrab per 1-day bin ) .",
    "the asm results provide a thorough context for the analysis and interpretation of the rxte pointed observations reported below . beyond the results shown in figure  [ fig : asm ] ,",
    "there have been no further asm detections of gro j1655 - 40 through the end of 1998 may ( mjd 50965 ) .",
    "the central theme of this paper is an x - ray timing analysis of a series of 52 observations with the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "the instrument is described by @xcite ( 1996 ) .",
    "the pca consists of five xenon - filled detectors with a total collecting area @xmath12 6200 @xmath20 at 5 kev , sensitivity in the range of 260 kev , and @xmath21 energy resolution at 5 kev .",
    "depending on the observing modes chosen for a particular observation , the time resolution may be as fine as 1 @xmath22s .    the pca observation times are listed in table  [ tab : obs ]",
    "; they are distributed throughout the 19961997 outburst , as shown in figure  [ fig : asm ] .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] also provides exposure times , the number of detector units ( pcus ) that were collecting data , and the pca observing modes .",
    "the data in this study include all of the observations in our ao-1 guest observer program ( p10255 ) , and also the observations for the ao-2 public archive ( p20402 ) , except for those data obtained after mjd 50685 ( 1997 august 25 ) when the source intensity was below 1 mcrab . with one exception",
    ", we define an observation as the collection of pca data obtained on any one particular ut day . on 1996",
    "november 2 , gro j1655 - 40 changed its intensity and qpo properties significantly between intervals of good exposure time , and we therefore divided these data into two observations labeled `` a '' and `` b '' , respectively ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : results ] we provide a variety of measurements that describe the x - ray emission properties of gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "these include the pca count rates for three energy bands ( cols . 3 , 7 , and 8) , the standard deviation of the full ( effectively 225 kev ) pca count rate in 1 s bins ( col .",
    "4 ) , two types of pca hardness ratio ( cols . 5 , 6 ) , and qpo frequencies and comments relevant to the observations ( col . 9 ) .",
    "these results will be used below to help evaluate the conditions under which the different types of qpos appear .      in figures  [ fig :",
    "pds1][fig : pds3 ] we show the power spectra for each of the 52 pca observations of gro j1655 - 40 listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the corrections for instrument dead time and electrical recovery from very large events adopts the model for `` paralyzable '' effects described by morgan , remillard , & greiner ( 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , the instrument operates with a combination of paralyzable and non - paralyzable interruptions ( @xcite ) , and our corrections leave behind residual broadband power at the level of 0.1% hz@xmath5 of the net count rate . since our power spectra are normalized to represent the square of the fractional rms amplitude per hz , any broad continuum at high frequencies in figures [ fig : pds1][fig : pds3 ] with a power density @xmath23 hz@xmath5 is likely to represent residual instrumental effects rather than a real signature of source behavior .    all of the power spectra in figures  [ fig : pds1][fig : pds3 ] show a broadband continuum that typically decreases with frequency in a manner roughly described as a power law with an index of 1.2 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "frequently there is very broad curvature in this continuum in the log power vs. log frequency plane , extending from 0.110 hz with an excess centered near 1 hz . during many observations ,",
    "we also see qpos in the range of 728 hz .",
    "the profiles of these qpos are complex . in several cases ( e.g. 07/25/96 , 08/16/96 , 08/22/96 , 09/04/96 , 09/09/96 , 10/27/96 )",
    ", the profiles suggest separate broad and narrow qpos , with the latter found at higher frequency .",
    "furthermore , there are two occasions ( 8/01/96 and 11/02/96b ) in which there is an additional low - frequency qpo near 0.1 hz .    during the final decay of gro j1655 - 40 in 1997 august ( after mjd 50663 ) , the power continuum abruptly increases and flattens , and there are renewed qpos with relatively narrow profiles . these changes in the power spectra",
    "coincide with the episode of spectral hardening seen in the asm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] ) .",
    "further spectral analysis of this low - hard state is deferred to a later publication .    to derive the central frequencies and widths of each qpo",
    ", we fit the power spectra to a local continuum , using a power law function , plus a qpo assumed to have a lorentzian profile .",
    "we used a least - squares technique to determine the best fit . in the range of 728 hz",
    ", we allowed for the presence of two overlapping qpos with different widths .",
    "the locations of the continuum fitting regions had to be adjusted for the particular qpo locations and broadband power characteristics of each observation .",
    "the central qpo frequencies derived from these fits are included in table  [ tab : results ] , while all of the qpo parameters for individual detections in the range of 0.128 hz are given in table  [ tab : qpos ] .",
    "these parameters include the central frequency ( @xmath25 ) , the fwhm value ( in hz ) , the coherence parameter ( @xmath26fwhm ) , and the qpo amplitude , which is the integrated power normalized to the mean count rate of gro j1655 - 40 in the appropriate energy band .",
    "the data summarized in table  [ tab : results ] show that the intensity and spectrum of the source can be used to predict the presence of qpos at 728 hz . excluding the low / hard state at the end of the 199697 outburst , the approximate thresholds for qpo activity are : a 225 kev count rate of 4000 c ps .",
    "pcu@xmath5 , a 925 kev count rate of 200 c ps .",
    "pcu@xmath5 , a value of 0.45 in _",
    "pca hr1 _ ( counts at 5 - 9 kev / counts at 2 - 5 kev ) , or a value of 0.14 in",
    "_ pca hr2 _ ( counts at 9 - 13 kev / counts at 5 - 9 kev ) .",
    "these thresholds are all related to the appearance of substantial flux above 9 kev , which suggests that the qpo mechanism is linked to the hard power - law component and thus to the source of relativistic electrons . in the case of grs1915 + 105 ,",
    "the increase in qpo amplitudes with photon energy supported a similar conclusion ( @xcite ) .",
    "further considerations regarding the qpo mechanism are given in section 5 .",
    "the relationship between qpo activity and the hard x - ray spectrum motivated us to combine the individual power spectra in groups determined by their spectral hardness , in order to search for more subtle features , especially at higher frequency .",
    "using the _",
    "pca hr1 _ values given in table  [ tab : results ] , we sorted and combined the individual power spectra ( excluding observations 5052 ) into four groups : 1996 and _ hr1 _ @xmath27 , 1997 and _ hr1 _ @xmath27 , @xmath28 _ hr1 _ @xmath29 , and _ hr1 _ @xmath30 .",
    "we label these groups , respectively , `` soft 1996 '' , `` soft 1997 '' , `` hard '' , and `` very hard '' .",
    "for each group the individual power spectra ( 225 kev ) were averaged after weighting them by their respective exposure times .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : pdssum ] , where four important details can be noted .",
    "( 1 ) the 27 power spectra in the group `` soft 1997 '' do provide a narrow qpo just below 30 hz .",
    "( 2 ) there is a suggestion that the qpos move to lower frequency as the spectrum becomes harder .",
    "( 3 ) the qpo near 0.1 hz is apparent in the `` very hard '' group . ( 4 ) finally , and most importantly , there is a broad bump near 300 hz for the `` very hard '' group .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pdssumz ] we replot figure  [ fig : pdssum ] with a magnified scale to provide closer inspection of those qpo features above 10 hz .",
    "we fit the profiles for two of the qpos , as described above .",
    "the qpo for the `` soft 1997 '' group is located at 28.3 hz with a fwhm of 3.6 hz and an integrated amplitude of 0.31% over the effective pca bandwidth ( 225 kev ) . in the remainder of section 3.2 we focus solely on the broad feature near 300 hz .",
    "the qpo fit at 300 hz for the `` very hard '' group ( figure  [ fig : pdssumz ] ) yields a central frequency of 298.3 hz , a fwhm of 77 hz , and an integrated amplitude of 0.45% .",
    "the significance of this qpo detection above the local power continuum is 6.2 @xmath18 in the highest bin and 12 @xmath18 as an integrated feature .",
    "the origin of the 300 hz feature within the `` very hard '' group is investigated in figure  [ fig : pdsstack ] . here the a and b observations of 1996 nov 2 have been combined .",
    "the fit for the qpo profile and the local power continuum is shown with a solid line .",
    "a weak power excess near 300 hz is seen in most of the individual power spectra , especially in the five power spectra for 1996 august .",
    "we conclude that the 300 hz feature is statistically diluted among the individual power spectra , as would be expected for observations of a very weak yet stationary process .    if we select only the 1996 august observations within the `` very hard '' group ( i.e. the top 5 panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdsstack ] ) and refit the continuum and qpo profile , then the detection significance of the integrated 300 hz feature is again 12 @xmath18 , and the other results are changed only slightly : the central frequency is 297.5 hz , the fwhm is 68 hz , and the integrated amplitude is 0.48% .",
    "the upper limits ( 3 @xmath18 ) for a qpo in the range of 250350 hz ( with fwhm of 68 hz ) are 0.21% of the mean flux for the `` hard '' group , 0.16% for the `` soft 1997 '' group , and 0.32% for the `` soft 1996 '' group .",
    "we therefore conclude that the 298 hz qpo in gro j1655 - 40 is significantly weaker or absent when the luminosity in the power - law component falls below that of the `` very hard '' group ( i.e. when _",
    "@xmath31 ) .    finally , the effort to ascertain whether the frequency of this qpo is constant is limited to the weak indications provided in figure  [ fig : pdsstack ] .",
    "we searched for a qpo with a central frequency in the range of 180420 hz for each individual panel shown in figure  [ fig : pdsstack ] ; the power spectra in the top six panels yield a sample of central frequencies that are distributed as 300.2 @xmath32 13.4 hz ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "the variations in frequency are consistent with scatter due to statistical limitations . meanwhile , the count rates in the hard pca band ( i.e. above 9 kev ) for these same six observations vary by a factor of 2.5 ( max / min ) . since the flux in hard photons is highly correlated with the appearance of this qpo , and",
    "since the hard flux variations are much larger than the dispersion in central frequency , we regard these results as an indication of frequency stability in the 300 hz feature .",
    "our detection of the 300 hz qpo in gro j1655 - 40 is limited to just one energy channel ( 225 kev ) for the following reason .",
    "the operating modes for the pca event analyzers ( eas ) are given in table  [ tab : obs ] . during the `` very hard '' observations ( 1996 august - november ) ,",
    "the four discretionary pca eas were operated in parallel in the following modes : ( 1 ) a 4-channel binned mode with 2 ms time resolution at 213 kev ; ( 2 ) a single - channel , `` single bit '' mode with 62 @xmath22s time resolution at 213 kev ; and ( 3 ) a 16 @xmath22s event mode for photons above 13 kev .",
    "the nyquist frequency for 298 hz oscillations corresponds to 1.7 ms , which is faster than the rate used in the 4-channel binned mode .",
    "we therefore have only two channels , divided at 13 kev , with which to examine phenomena at frequencies above 250 hz . during the `` very hard '' observations ,",
    "the 1325 kev source count rate was only 1018 % of the rate below 13 kev , and we do not detect a significant qpo in these data .",
    "the pca time resolution was increased to 4-channel coverage with 125 @xmath22s time resolution for the 1997 observations , but there were no further episodes of `` very hard '' emission during this period .    for the low frequency qpos , however , we can easily measure the qpo properties for `` hard '' and `` very hard '' observations in five different energy bands , with four bands telemetered in binned mode and the highest energy band obtained from event mode .",
    "we show two energy - resolved series of power spectra in figure  [ fig : pdsen ] .",
    "the left panels show results for an observation in the `` very hard '' group ( 08/16/96 ) , while the right panels show results for an observation in the `` hard '' group ( 09/09/96 ) .",
    "both cases show a broad qpo near 810 hz combined with a narrower qpo at higher frequency .",
    "the central frequencies for the 2-qpo fits ( 225 kev ) for each observation are shown with arrows in the top and bottom panels .",
    "the energy - resolved power spectra in figure  [ fig : pdsen ] show that the broad and narrow qpos have very different energy dependence : in both observations , the broad qpo is stronger at lower photon energies , while the narrow qpo shows an increase in amplitude at higher photon energies .",
    "further insight into the broad - soft and narrow - hard qpos are gained by plotting the central frequencies for the 2-qpo fits versus the pca count rate in the hard band ( 925 kev ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : fxqpo ] .",
    "the plotting symbols distinguish broad and narrow qpos using the coherence parameter , @xmath33 , as defined previously .",
    "the `` * '' symbol indicates broad qpos with @xmath34 , while the open triangles denote narrow qpos with @xmath35 .",
    "the data point marked `` x '' represents the narrow and weak qpo for the entire `` soft 1997 '' group , as shown in figure  [ fig : pdssumz ] .",
    "this 28 hz qpo appears to be a simple extrapolation of the narrow qpo branch shown in figure  [ fig : fxqpo ] .",
    "the frequency of narrow qpos is correlated with the intensity in hard x - rays , shifting from 28 to 14 hz as the hard intensity increases from zero to maximum .",
    "this is the only qpo that is visible as the count rate at 925 kev approaches zero .",
    "on the other hand , the broad qpos near 9 hz in figure  [ fig : fxqpo ] remain essentially stationary , and this qpo is not observed when the soft component dominates the spectrum .",
    "there are some exceptions to the pattern of qpo branches in figure  [ fig : fxqpo ] .",
    "for example , we do not detect two distinct qpos for every observation in the hard groups , and two of the qpo detections near 9 hz appear to be relatively narrow in fwhm .",
    "nevertheless , the weight of the evidence suggests that there are two quite different and yet coexisting types of qpos in gro j1655 - 40 in the range of 728 hz .      the power spectra of 08/01/96 ( fig .",
    "2 ) and 11/02/96b ( fig .",
    "3 ) each display a low - frequency qpo near 0.1 hz .",
    "these same two observations are at the extreme end of the `` very hard '' group , yielding the highest values for the x - ray intensity at 925 kev , as shown in table  [ tab : results ] and figure  [ fig : fxqpo ] .",
    "the 0.1 hz qpos lie atop substantial broadband power , and their integrated rms power values ( 2.9 and 4.4% of the mean count rate , respectively ) rank them among the qpos in gro j1655 - 40 with the highest amplitudes ( see table  [ tab : qpos ] ) .",
    "the appearance of low frequency qpos during conditions of high x - ray luminosity in gro j1655 - 40 is reminiscent of the behavior of the microquasar grs1915 + 105 .",
    "the latter source is prone to episodes of tremendous x - ray variability ( @xcite ) , but there are also occasions when the x - ray intensity of grs1915 + 105 is relatively low and steady ( with 1 - 10 hz qpos ) , and there are other occasions characterized by intermediate brightness , moderate flickering and qpos near 0.1 hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the power spectra of grs 1915 + 105 on 1996 april 17may 14 , 1996 september 22 , 1997 august 13 , and 1997 november 730 show qpos near 0.1 hz . the corresponding light curves show substantial flickering but there are no large cyclical variations and the rms deviation ( 1 s bins ) is less than 30% of the mean value , which is also true of our light curves of gro j1655 - 40 ( excluding absorption dips ) .",
    "there is an especially striking resemblance between the pca observation of gro j1655 - 40 on 1996 august 1 and the observation of grs 1915 + 105 on 1997 august 13 . in each case",
    ", the source appears to shift back and forth between a relatively steady emission state and another state in which both the intensity and the hardness ratio are strongly modulated by a 0.1 hz qpo .",
    "this behavior is illustrated for both sources in figure  [ fig : lcflick ] .",
    "both the x - ray intensity and variability of gro j1655 - 40 are as large as we have seen with rxte .",
    "however , grs1915 + 105 has shown a wide variety of much deeper oscillations on time scales ranging from seconds to @xmath1230 min .",
    "given the similarities shown here and the extraordinary behavior observed for grs 1915 + 105 ( @xcite ) , one may surmise that gro j1655 - 40 is on the verge of plunging into unstable x - ray emission on 1996 august 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcflick ] displays the closest link we have seen between gro j1655 - 40 during its radio - quiet x - ray outburst of 1996 - 1997 , and grs 1915 + 105 , which has been wildly active at both x - ray and radio frequencies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in section 5",
    "we use these intermittent 0.1 hz qpos , combined with spectral analyses and our knowledge of the black hole mass in gro j1655 - 40 , to speculate on the mass of the black hole in grs1915 + 105 .",
    "thus far we have described several relationships between qpo characteristics and the x - ray spectrum by correlating the qpo parameters with pca count rates and hardness ratios . in these interpretations",
    "we have assumed that the x - ray spectrum of gro j1655 - 40 can be described by a standard model consisting of a thermal component and a hard power law , with a minimal contribution from the thermal component above 9 kev .",
    "zhang et al ( 1997 ) used asca and batse observations of gro j1655 - 40 during 1995 august 15 - 16 to show that this spectral model produced an acceptable fit with an inner disk temperature of 1.36 kev .",
    "a spectral analysis of all of the data discussed herein is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we have investigated the mean spectra for each qpo - sorted group ( see section 3.2 ) and the results confirm our hypothesis that qpo activity in gro j1655 - 40 is strongly linked to the strength of the power - law component .",
    "we used `` xspec '' to analyze these data , assuming a `` disk blackbody '' model plus a power - law function , both attenuated by absorption due to cold gas along the line of sight .",
    "the analysis was performed with version 2.2.1 of the pca spectral response matrices ( written on 1997 oct 2 ) .",
    "since the high count rates and long exposure times for gro j1655 - 40 stringently test the quality of the pca spectral calibrations , we first investigated the spectra derived from long exposures of the crab nebula on 1997 march 22 , april 15 , and july 26 .",
    "we have concluded that the best performance from these particular response matrices is gained by choosing pcus # 0 , # 1 , and # 4 ( only ) , by restricting the analysis range to 2.525.0 kev ( with 54 data channels from pca standard mode 2 ) , and by imposing a systematic error of 1.0% on each data point .",
    "the statistical error bars for the spectral parameters in each group are very small , and so we conservatively choose to independently analyze the spectra provided by each of the three pcus , and then we use the sample standard deviation as the uncertainty in each spectral parameter .",
    "the absolute normalizations of pcu # 4 are chronically 10% lower than those of pcus # 0 and # 1 , and we accordingly raised the normalizations for pcu # 4 before reporting the results . finally , all of the spectral results ( unlike the counting rates reported in table 2 ) include corrections for the pca deadtime , which ranges from 1.5% to 12.8% per observation , depending on the source count rate .",
    "we conducted spectral fits in which we considered the value of the interstellar column density ( @xmath36 ) as a free parameter , and then we repeated the analysis with @xmath36 = 0.9@xmath37 @xmath9 , which is the value found with asca ( @xcite ) . the results for both cases are shown in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "although the fitted versus fixed values of @xmath36 are statistically different in most cases , this difference has only a minor effect on the other spectral parameters or the integrated flux .",
    "the reduced @xmath38 values ( table  [ tab : spec ] , col .",
    "4 ) for these spectral fits are reasonably good for the `` hard '' and `` very hard '' groups , with total exposure times @xmath1240 ks per pcu for each group . on the other hand , the `` soft 1996 '' group resisted all efforts to apply the disk blackbody plus power law model , including attempted modifications for emission lines , absorption edges , or compton reflection . separating the `` soft 1996 '' group into subsections a ( 1996 may 912 ) and b ( sept .",
    "26 and oct .",
    "3 ) isolates the temporal location of this unsolved problem . during the 1996 may observations , which occurred 14 - 17 days after the beginning of the x - ray outburst , we find @xmath39 , as the soft component appears to be too wide to fit with any combination of disk `` color temperature '' ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath36 .",
    "no such difficulty is evident for the `` soft 1996b '' group ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "problems with the spectral model are encountered again for the `` soft 1997 '' group . however , the residuals are only @xmath42% of the net flux in the accumulated spectra ( 102 ks per pcu ) , and we argue that the comparison of spectral parameters with the other groups provides useful information , despite the elevated value of @xmath43 .",
    "as the overall luminosity increases , it is clear that the temperature of the inner accretion disk increases from @xmath121.1 to nearly 1.5 kev , while the normalization decreases by a factor of 5 .",
    "this is the same pattern seen on a much more rapid time scale in the case of grs1915 + 105 ( @xcite ) .",
    "further evaluations of these results are given in section 5 .",
    "table  [ tab : spec ] confirms that the flux in the power - law component rises sharply as the spectrum evolves from the `` soft '' group to the `` hard '' group , and on to the `` very hard '' group , as we had deduced from the pca hardness ratios . in the `` hard '' group ,",
    "the power - law component represents @xmath1230% of the total x - ray flux , and this fraction increases to @xmath1270% in the `` very hard '' group . in both",
    "the `` hard '' and `` very hard '' groups , the photon index is in the range of 2.42.7 , which is very similar to the results obtained in earlier outbursts for the range of 20600 kev with cgro ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our 1996 august 29 pca observation was used with rxte hexte and cgro osse observations to measure a photon index of 2.7 with a lower limit of 800 kev for the cutoff energy associated with the power law component ( @xcite ) .",
    "our similar value of the photon index for the `` very hard '' group instills some confidence that the power law component is well determined here , despite the constraint which limits our spectral fits to photon energies below 25 kev .",
    "our spectral results allow us to quantify the thresholds for qpo activity in terms of @xmath16 , which is 9 @xmath44 erg ps .",
    "for a 7  black hole .",
    "the threshold where the broad 9 hz qpo appears is @xmath2 .",
    "we detect 300 hz qpos at @xmath45 , and 0.1 hz qpos appear at a slightly higher value , @xmath46 . for these values to have utility ,",
    "the power - law component must radiate isotropically from a region that is roughly as compact as the inner accretion disk .",
    "the 300 hz qpo in gro j1655 - 40 is the fastest oscillation ever seen in a black hole binary .",
    "efforts to explain this feature , and also the 67 hz qpo in grs1915 + 105 , commonly invoke effects of general relativity ( gr ) , and these results provide an important opportunity to investigate both the properties of these black holes and also the physics of strong gravitational fields ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are at least four proposed mechanisms that relate these fast qpo frequencies to a natural time scale of the inner accretion disk in a black hole binary .",
    "these are : the last stable orbit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , diskoseismic oscillations ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) , frame dragging ( @xcite ) , and oscillations related to a centrifugal - barrier model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the physics of all of these phenomena invokes gr effects in the inner accretion disk .",
    "it has also been proposed that the high frequency qpos may be caused by an inertial - acoustic instability in the disk ( @xcite ) , which has a non - gr origin . however , this model as proposed does not extend to frequencies as high as the 300 hz qpo of gro j1655 - 40 .    any model for the high - frequency qpos in microquasars must also explain the observed amplitudes and spectral characteristics of these qpos and the manner in which these properties vary with the state of the x - ray source . in the case of gro j1655 - 40",
    ", the 300 hz qpo is detected only in the `` very hard '' group , when the x - ray luminosity is near @xmath47 and the power - law component dominates the spectrum . the upper limits for 300 hz qpos in the other groups imply that this qpo is at least a factor of 2 - 3 weaker ( in % amplitude ) in fainter states . while the power law component is the primary cause of variations in x - ray luminosity , there is also an evolution in the thermal component as the luminosity increases .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that changes in the inner disk are actually responsible for the 300 hz qpo , and that the larger changes in the power law component are an unrelated byproduct of the accretion state . in that case",
    ", the qpo would have an amplitude @xmath481.5% of the disk flux , since the deconvolution of the spectral components in terms of pca counting rate indicates that 33% of the counts in the `` very hard '' state come from the disk while 67% originate in the power law component .",
    "the spectral constraints on the origin of the 67 hz qpo in grs1915 + 105 are far more challenging for disk oscillation models , since the qpo amplitude has been shown to be as high as 6% at photon energies above 13 kev , where the disk contributes a small fraction of the x - ray flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "the multiplicity of models and the incomplete connections between inner disk timescales and the spectral properties of the high - frequency qpos remain as outstanding problems in this field .",
    "zhang , cui , & chen ( 1997 ) have outlined gr corrections to the disk blackbody model that allow estimation of the real temperature and radius of the inner accretion disk from the measured values of @xmath40 and the disk blackbody normalization . assuming a distance of 3.2 kpc , our spectral results for the `` very hard '' group ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) imply an unabsorbed flux of 3.4 @xmath49 erg @xmath9 ps .  for the disk component .",
    "if we substitute this value along with a color temperature of 1.49 kev into equation 3 of zhang , cui , & chen ( 1997 ) , then the inner disk radius ( @xmath50 ) associated with the `` very hard '' group is 19 km .",
    "this value is basically in agreement with their results ( 22 km ) , which were derived from batse / asca observations during 1995 august ( @xcite ) . as pointed out by zhang , cui , & chen ( 1997 ) ,",
    "this small inner disk can only be larger than the last stable orbit ( @xmath51 ) for a 7 black hole if the black hole rotation is prograde and @xmath4890% of the maximum value .",
    "the rxte spectral results for the `` very hard '' group are consistent with this view , although some of the individual `` very hard '' observations imply inner disk radii as small as 10 km ( see below and also @xcite ) , implying a maximally rotating black hole .",
    "on the other hand , the large _ increase _ in the normalization of the disk component for the `` soft '' x - ray groups ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) necessarily suggests @xmath52 for the same values of black hole mass and spin .",
    "these significant variations in @xmath53 for gro j1655 - 40 are distinctly different from typical x - ray novae ( @xcite ) , and yet they resemble the pattern of changes seen at much more rapid time scales ( i.e. tens of s ) in the case of grs1915 + 105 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we consider these results literally , then we must ask why the disk should terminate well outside the last stable orbit when the luminosity of gro j1655 - 40 ( @xmath54 ) is dominated by the thermal component in a radio quiet state . at present",
    "there is no straightforward explanation ; further work is being done to investigate the spectral evolution of gro j1655 - 40 at shorter time scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the need to monitor the spectral evolution of black hole binaries in order to scrutinize the inner disk region . the disk blackbody model with gr corrections may or may not provide a quantitative and reliable estimate of the inner disk radius .",
    "nevertheless , it does appear that the soft x - ray components in the microquasars gro j1655 - 40 and grs1915 + 105 vary much more in temperature and normalization than do the soft components in typical x - ray novae .    while our analysis of qpo properties in gro j1655 - 40 motivated a segregation of rxte observations into groups defined by pca hardness ratio ,",
    "there is , in fact , a good correlation between these groups and the canonical states of black hole binaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the `` soft '' groups correspond with the `` high state '' seen at 1 - 20 kev , while `` hard '' and `` very hard '' groups display the qpos and the strong power law component ( with index @xmath55 ) that define the `` very high state '' .",
    "previous observations of the very high state have been limited to transient conditions in gx339 - 4 and gs 1124 - 68 ( x - ray nova muscae 1991 ) .",
    "there is also a suggestion that the chronic qpos and high luminosity in grs1915 + 105 constitute some kind of variations of the very high state ( @xcite ) .",
    "the qpo characteristics of gro j1655 - 40 appear to bridge the phenomenology of gs 1124 - 68 and grs1915 + 105 , and these rxte results provide a large increase in the historical archive for the canonical form of the very high state .",
    "following up on the similarity of particular rxte observations of gro j1655 - 40 and grs1915 + 105 presented in section 3.4 and figure  [ fig : lcflick ] , we modeled the average spectrum for each observation as described in section 4 .",
    "we then computed the luminosity , assuming distances of 3.2 and 12.5 kpc , respectively . for gro j1655 - 40",
    ", we find @xmath40 = 1.71 kev , the disk blackbody normalization is 172 , the photon index is 2.50 , the unabsorbed total luminosity is 2.0 @xmath44 erg ps .  at 125 kev , or @xmath56 , and",
    "the corrected value for the inner disk radius is @xmath57 km . in the case of grs1915 + 105",
    ", we find @xmath40 = 1.70 kev , the disk blackbody normalization is 338 , the photon index is 3.17 , the unabsorbed @xmath58 erg ps .  at 125 kev , and @xmath59 km ( assuming maximum rotation and a disk inclination of 70@xmath60 ) .",
    "we may speculate that the conditions in these two microquasars are similar with respect to either the inner disk , with @xmath61 for maximally rotating black holes , or with respect to the value of @xmath16 .",
    "in such cases , grs1915 + 105 contains the more massive black hole , with @xmath62 in the range of 3870 .",
    "we have shown that the full composition of qpos in gro j1655 - 40 includes another quasi - stable frequency in the form of a broad qpo ( 13% amplitude ) at 9 hz .",
    "there is no obvious scheme in which to asign the system s natural time scales to both the 9 and 300 hz oscillations for the same values of black hole mass and spin rate .",
    "moreover , the presence of the 9 hz qpo complicates the application of the frame - dragging model to qpos in black hole binaries ( @xcite ) . here ,",
    "an 8 hz qpo in gs 1124 - 68 was interpreted as being analogous to the 300 hz qpo in gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "however , in this paper we have shown that there are two low - frequency qpos in gro j1655 - 40 that are much closer in frequency to the 8 hz qpo in gs 1124 - 68 , confusing the selection of qpos that might represent the frame dragging effect . moreover , of the four qpo tracks in gro j1655 - 40 , only the 9 hz qpo appears to have the `` soft '' x - ray spectrum expected for a purely disk - rooted oscillation .",
    "clearly there is a need for additional opportunities to observe x - ray sources in the very high state , as we continue to make progress in learning how to use x - ray qpos to investigate the properties of black holes and also to determine the origin of the hard x - ray photons in black hole binaries .",

    "<S> we have investigated 52 rxte pointed observations of gro j1655 - 40 spanning the x - ray outburst that commenced on 1996 april 25 and lasted for 16 months . </S>",
    "<S> our x - ray timing analyses reveal four types of qpos : three with relatively stable central frequencies at 300 hz , 9 hz , and 0.1 hz , and a fourth that varied over the range 1428 hz . </S>",
    "<S> the 300 hz and 0.1 hz qpos appear only at the highest observed luminosities ( @xmath0 ) , where the power - law component dominates the x - ray spectrum , and the inner disk is characterized by a @xmath1 kev color temperature and an estimated inner radius of only 10 - 20 km . at lower luminosity ( @xmath2 ) , the thermal component dominates the spectrum ; the disk is somewhat cooler ( @xmath3 kev ) and its inner radius is larger . in this state only two of the qpos are observed : the broad and spectrally `` soft '' 9 hz qpo , and the narrow , `` hard '' qpo that varies from 14 - 28 hz as the hard flux decreases . at still lower luminosities ( @xmath4 ) , the power - law component contributes less than 30% of the total luminosity , the inner disk appears both larger and cooler , the 9 hz qpo vanishes , and only a very weak ( rms 0.3% ) and narrow qpo at 28 hz remains .    </S>",
    "<S> the 300 hz qpo is likely to be analogous to the stationary qpo at 67 hz seen in the microquasar grs1915 + 105 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss four models of these high - frequency qpos which depend on effects due to general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> the models suggest that these rapid qpos may eventually provide a measure of the mass and rotation of the accreting black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the 9 hz qpo displays a spectrum consistent with a thermal origin , but this frequency does not appear to be consistent with any of the natural time scales associated with the disk , or with the inferred values of the mass and rapid spin of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism for the 14 - 28 hz qpos appears to be linked to the power - law component , as do the 1 - 10 hz qpos in grs1915 + 105 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these low - frequency qpos have the potential to lead us to the origin of the energetic electrons that radiate the power - law spectral component . finally , we show data for gro j1655 - 40 and grs1915 + 105 as each source teeters between relative stability and a state of intense oscillations at 0.1 hz . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the sources spectral parameters allows us to speculate that the black hole mass in grs1915 + 105 is very large  possibly in the range 39 - 70 .    </S>",
