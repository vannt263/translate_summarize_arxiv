    "multipartite entanglement is one of the important areas in the field of quantum information that has many applications including quantum secret sharing . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the dicke states  @xcite , which are useful building blocks in realizing multipartite entanglement . the @xmath0-qubit weight @xmath1 dicke state , @xmath2 , is the equal superposition of all @xmath0-qubit states of weight @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to  @xcite and the references therein for detailed discussion .",
    "after the invention of quantum information , many experimental setups have been proposed and tested to verify some theoretical properties .",
    "most of experiments have been focused on the test of multipartite entanglement such as epr , ghz , and w states .",
    "since the result of experimental tests depends on the steps for preparing , processing , and measuring , all steps should be refined as much as possible . among them",
    ", the first priority is to prepare the target state with very high fidelity and with efficiency . in this work , therefore , we also focus on the efficient way to prepare certain multipartite quantum state .    in line of ghz and w states",
    ", we have the dicke state , @xmath2 , which an equal superposition state of all @xmath0-qubit states of weight @xmath1 .",
    "actually , dicke state is more general state than ghz and w states since w state is @xmath3 and ghz state is the superposition of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the preparation method for dicke state can be utilized for other general case as well . at the same time ,",
    "similar to the above reason , dicke state can be utilized for many applications such as secret sharing @xcite and quantum networking @xcite .",
    "related to this , some previous works have been done that focussed on the experimental ways to prepare six - qubit dicke state @xcite with fidelity @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "while the main focus from the viewpoint of experimental physics is to actually provide the implementation of specific dicke states , our focus is from theoretical algorithmic angle and the only result presented in this direction appeared in  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we show how one can efficiently construct dicke states by using the combinatorial properties of symmetric boolean functions , two well - known quantum algorithms , and the generalized parity measurement . by efficient , we mean that the resource requirements in terms of quantum circuits and number of execution steps is poly@xmath8 to obtain @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider @xmath0-qubit states in the computational basis @xmath9 that can be written in the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 can also be interpreted as a binary string and the number of @xmath13 s in the string is called the ( hamming ) weight of @xmath12 and denoted as @xmath14 .",
    "based on this an arbitrary dicke state can be expressed as follows : @xmath15 let us also define a symmetric @xmath0-qubit state as @xmath16    first , we show how one can prepare a symmetric @xmath0-qubit state with the property that @xmath17 is @xmath18 by using deutsch - jozsa algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this requires certain novel combinatorial observations related to symmetric boolean functions .",
    "then the quantum state out of deutsch - jozsa algorithm is measured using the parity measurement technique  @xcite to obtain @xmath2 with a probability @xmath18 .",
    "thus , @xmath19 runs are sufficient to obtain the required dicke state .",
    "note that a direct approach to construct a symmetric state has been presented in  @xcite using biased hadamard transform . while the order of probability to obtain dicke state by ours and that of  @xcite are the same ,",
    "enumeration results show that the exact probability values are better in our case than that of  @xcite .",
    "further , motivated by the idea in  @xcite , we improve our algorithm further with a modified deutsch - jozsa operator that involves the biased hadamard transform . since biased hadamard transform also helps to generate the target symmetric state , the overall probability to obtain the dicke state increases .",
    "finally , we can also apply the grover operator  @xcite before the measurement .",
    "since grover algorithm amplifies the amplitude of target symmetric state , this helps to reduce the necessary number of steps into @xmath20{n})$ ] .",
    "a boolean function on @xmath0 variables may be viewed as a mapping from @xmath21 into @xmath22 .",
    "let us denote the addition operator over @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 both belong to @xmath21 and the inner product @xmath27 let @xmath28 be a boolean function on @xmath0 variables .",
    "walsh transform _ of @xmath28 is a real valued function over @xmath21 which is defined as @xmath29    an @xmath0-variable boolean function @xmath30 is called symmetric if @xmath31 for all @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "henceforth , we will denote the set of @xmath0-variable symmetric boolean functions as @xmath34 .    in the truth table of @xmath35 ,",
    "it is enough to provide outputs corresponding to different weights of elements of @xmath9 only .",
    "so an @xmath0-variable symmetric function can be expressed by an @xmath36 length bit string as @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the output at the inputs of weight @xmath39 and @xmath40 is referred to as the simplified value vector .",
    "when @xmath41 , one may note that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 such that @xmath44 . therefore , the walsh spectrum of @xmath30 can be represented by an @xmath36 length integer string @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 represents the walsh spectrum value at the inputs of weight @xmath39 .",
    "we now relate the walsh spectrum of the symmetric functions  @xcite with krawtchouk polynomials  @xcite .",
    "krawtchouk polynomial of degree @xmath39 is given by @xmath47 from  @xcite , we get that if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 the @xmath50 matrix which has @xmath51 as the @xmath52-th element is known as the krawtchouk matrix  @xcite .    for example , let us present the krawtchouk matrix for @xmath53 and @xmath54 as follows :    @xmath55,$ ] @xmath56.$ ]    in these two matrices , one can verify the properties related to the krawtchouk matrix given in proposition [ prop3a ] .    to determine all the walsh spectrum values of @xmath41 , it is enough to multiply @xmath57 with the @xmath50 krawtchouk matrix .",
    "applying krawtchouk matrix , the analysis of the walsh spectra of symmetric functions becomes combinatorially interesting .",
    "elements of a krawtchouk matrix have nice combinatorial properties and they follow nice symmetry  @xcite too .",
    "we list some of them in the following proposition .",
    "[ prop3a ] 1 .",
    "@xmath58 , + 2 .",

    "@xmath63 , + 6 .",
    "@xmath64 , + 7 .",
    "@xmath65 + @xmath66 .",
    "the symmetric boolean functions can be efficiently implemented .",
    "as described in  @xcite , the circuit complexity of @xmath0-variable symmetric boolean functions is @xmath67 .",
    "it is known that given a classical circuit @xmath30 , there is a quantum circuit of comparable efficiency which computes the transformation @xmath68 that takes input like @xmath69 and produces output like @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we will consider that for @xmath35 , the quantum circuit @xmath68 can be efficiently implemented using @xmath71 circuit complexity .",
    "consider that we want to maximize the walsh spectrum value corresponding to weight @xmath1 points and naturally , from the property of symmetric functions , all of them will be equal .",
    "now we present an important combinatorial result to show how to find such symmetric boolean functions .",
    "[ ex1 ] as example , consider @xmath78 . in the corresponding column of the @xmath79 matrix , we get the values as @xmath80 .",
    "thus , we will consider the function with @xmath40 as @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "for such an @xmath82 , the walsh spectrum values at the points @xmath83 , such that @xmath84 , will be maximized , which is @xmath85 .",

    "one may similarly note that for the trivial cases of @xmath112 or @xmath0 , if one chooses @xmath35 following theorem  [ thm2 ] , then @xmath113 .",
    "however , proving the result similar to theorem  [ thm3 ] for any @xmath0 and any weight @xmath1 , in general , seems to be quite tedious .",
