    "the strong - correlation physics of bilayer electron systems in the quantum hall regime has been of interest since shortly after the discovery of the quantum hall effect.@xcite of particular interest is the occurrence of broken - symmetry states with spontaneous interlayer phase coherence@xcite(silc ) that continue to be a source of surprises and puzzles.@xcite in the quantum hall regime , landau - level degeneracy leads to competing nascent broken symmetries ; the silc broken symmetry is driven by the strong interlayer electronic correlations that it produces , and competes subtly with a spatially diagonal broken symmetry state in which electronic charge spontaneously occupies one of the two layers .",
    "( in the case of a bilayer system with small interlayer separations and low densities , the silc state can occur in principle even at zero magnetic field.@xcite )    the energy of bilayer quantum hall systems can be expanded in powers of the layer separation @xmath0 , the parameter that most critically controls their properties .",
    "the competition between silc and charge - ordered states is decided only by terms of second and higher order in @xmath0 .",
    "the property that silc and charge - ordered states in bilayers have the same energies to first order in @xmath0 is not an accident and can be understood using the bilayer pseudospin language.@xcite in this description , electrons in top and bottom layers are eigenstates of the @xmath1 component of the pseudospin , while electrons with interlayer coherence have pseudospin projections in the @xmath2 plane . similarly , the charge - ordered and silc - ordered states correspond , respectively , to states with ising and xy ferromagnetic order .",
    "the competition between these two states depends on the sign of the pseudospin anisotropy energy.@xcite the pseudospin - dependent part of the interaction in bilayers is proportional to the difference between same - layer and different - layer electron - electron interactions , which for two - dimensional electron - electron interactions is proportional to @xmath3/q$ ] in reciprocal space , where @xmath4 is the magnitude of the in - plane wave vector .",
    "the origin of the mysterious absence of a pseudospin anisotropy energy at first order in @xmath0 is now clear since the term in this interaction that is first order in @xmath0 is independent of @xmath4 ; _ i.e. _ , it is a delta - function interaction that has no effect on fully spin - polarized fermions because of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the leading terms in the pseudospin magnetic anisotropy energy@xcite in this case appears at second order in @xmath0 and , as it turns out , leads to silc rather than charge order .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the investigation of order in quantum hall systems at integer total filling factors to the case of multilayers , where the pseudospin analogy does not apply .",
    "we should then expect the energetic difference between charge ( diagonal ) and silc ( off - diagonal ) order to be settled at first order in @xmath0 .",
    "we find that , in contrast to the bilayer case , charge order is favored in multilayers for small @xmath0 .",
    "states with interlayer phase coherence can , however , be stabilized by relatively weak interlayer tunneling , and we predict that they will have unusual physical properties .",
    "our conclusions are based on a comparison of variational energies for states with charge order and states with silc in multilayer quantum hall systems.@xcite the multilayer silc states are characterized by spontaneous finite - width bloch minibands . we compare the energies of these miniband wave functions to those of states with strong but independent correlations within each layer , including charge - ordered staggered states with unequal layer densities .",
    "physically , this difference between bilayers and multiple - quantum - well systems occurs because the hartree energy per volume for states with a given charge imbalance is far lower in the superlattice case , as much as four times lower compared to bilayers . in some cases",
    "however , relatively small interlayer tunneling amplitudes are sufficient to stabilize uniform density miniband states .",
    "we propose that these states could be identified experimentally by a substantially enhanced growth - direction conductance that is due to their strong interlayer correlations , and argue that they might also support bloch oscillations .",
    "multilayer quantum hall systems have been fabricated which exhibit the quantum hall effect at integer filling factors per layer,@xcite and an interesting body of recent work has focused on the chiral surface states that occur in this instance.@xcite at fractional filling factors , most work@xcite has concentrated on the physics at the special values of filling factor per layer values for which laughlin - jastrow@xcite states with strong intralayer correlations occur .",
    "our interest here is in nearly disorder - free multilayer systems at strong magnetic fields with general fractional filling factors per layer , @xmath5 , between zero and one .",

    "related physics can in principle occur in other quasi two - dimensional electron systems , for example layered organic conductors.@xcite    our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : minigs ] we present our silc variational wave functions and compare their energies with those of states which have neither charge order nor interlayer correlations .",
    "the silc states , which have better interlayer correlations but less favorable intralayer correlations , have lower energy when @xmath0 is small . in section",
    "[ sec : staggered ] we consider charged - ordered multiple - quantum - well states .",
    "these states achieve the objective of reducing the liklihood of close approaches between electrons in nearby layers simply by reducing the average charge density in the neighboring layer , rather than by improving interlayer correlations . in this section",
    "we demonstrate that charge - ordered states are favored over silc states .",
    "section [ sec : transport ] discusses the properties of the coherent bloch miniband states in the case where interlayer coherence is aided by tunneling between the electron layers ; although the coherence in this case is not spontaneous , it is strongly enhanced by interactions .",

    "the energies of these states,@xcite whose character changes rapidly with @xmath5 , is relatively accurately known . in bilayer systems , as interactions between the two - dimensional layers increase in importance , the many - particle ground state develops silc , which promotes interlayer correlations at the cost of partially disrupting correlations within the layers .",

    "this result for @xmath35 for balanced bilayers is in close agreement with other theoretical estimates : the time - dependent hf collective - mode stability criterion@xcite gives @xmath38=1.18 , and finite - size exact diagonalization studies@xcite give @xmath38=1.175 .",
    "this is consistent with experimental findings@xcite when the finite - thickness@xcite of the electrons layers and quantum fluctuations@xcite are taken into account . in double - quantum - well systems ,",

    "[ fig : enu ] , taken at face value , is evidence for the possibility of a miniband silc state at sufficiently small layer separation .",
    "however , as explained in the introduction , the competition between silc and charge order is a subtle one even in the bilayer case , and there is good reason to expect that this competition plays out differently in a multiple - quantum - well system .",
    "we therefore turn our attention in the following section to variational wave functions with charge order .",
    "we showed in the previous section that for sufficiently small interlayer separations , the miniband state is always energetically favored over independent - layer states of equal uniform density .",
    "however , we must also consider the possibility that at small interlayer separations , the exchange interaction could favor independent - layer states with unequal densities . indeed",
    ", the possibility of staging transitions in multilayer systems was discussed in ref .  , where hf calculations predicted a series of staging transitions in which occupied layers were separated by an increasing number of empty layers as the particle density and interlayer separation were decreased .",
    "in the bilayer case , the predicted@xcite staging transition is not expected to occur , even at zero magnetic field;@xcite instead , it is preempted by a transition to a bilayer silc state with equal layer densities.@xcite even in the case of the bilayer quantum hall state , the silc state is barely favored over the unblanced state with @xmath5=1 in one layer and @xmath5=0 in the other layer for @xmath39 : the two states are degenerate at @xmath0=0 and , as explained in the introduction , the silc state is lower in energy only at order @xmath40 .",
    "the bilayer silc state is most stable at intermediate densities between 0 and @xmath35 .    in the superlattice case",
    ", we show below that the ( @xmath33=0 ) miniband silc state loses energetically to staggered states at small @xmath0 .",
    "one important reason for this is that the hartree energy per volume of a staggered - density state is far lower in a superlattice than in a bilayer .",
    "this is understood qualitatively by considering the case of two - dimensional charge sheets of alternating areal charge density @xmath41 . for a superlattice ,",
    "the bulk - system requirement that the voltage drop due to the electric fields be zero across two layer spacings produces an electric field of constant magnitude that alternates in sign across each layer : @xmath42 , from gauss law . the same calculation for a classical bilayer capacitor gives an electric field that is twice as large , @xmath43 .",
    "the hartree energy per unit volume is given by @xmath44 , so it costs four times less energy per volume to have a staggered state in a superlattice as compared to a bilayer .    to make the comparison more precise ,",
    "we have computed the energy of the silc state analytically in the limit @xmath45 by summing up the interactions of an electron with exchange hole contributions from remote layers .",
    "the two states compete by measuring the loss in exchange energy in the silc state that is due to removing a part of the exchange hole to remote layers against the hartree energy of the charge - ordered state discussed above . from eq .",

    "however , the hf approximation underestimates the miniband energy , and it may be that correlation effects ( and finite - thickness effects ) improve the energetics of the miniband states .",
    "unfortunately , we can not provide a reliable estimate of the correlation - energy contribution to the miniband state , since the generalized random - phase approximation gives a logarithmically divergent ( and negative ) result.@xcite we are not able to make a definitive conclusion on the possibility that fluctuation effects beyond the hf approximation stabilize the miniband state for small or even zero interlayer tunneling , or whether there are other superlattice silc states besides the miniband state which could be realized , leaving this as an issue that must ultimately be decided experimentally . in section [ sec : transport ]",
    "we discuss experimental signatures of the miniband state .",
    "it is useful to compare the energy of the miniband state to those of more general staggered states .",

    "quantum hall miniband states are expected to have greatly reduced scattering rates because of their many - body interlayer correlations .",
    "we caution that our proposals must be regarded as uncertain , since they are based on single - slater - determinant variational wave functions .",
    "for example , interlayer correlations can be established by quantum fluctuations not included in this hf theory without breaking any symmetries .",
    "additionally , the fact that interlayer correlations establish a charge gap in bilayer systems , but not in multiple - quantum - well systems , may make mean - field - theory considerations less reliable in the present case .",
    "we therefore feel that the true nature of the ground state can only be established experimentally and , with this in mind , have argued that enhanced growth - direction conductivity due to collective transport is a reliable signature of spontaneous or interaction - enhanced interlayer coherence .",
    "aside from a large miniband - enhanced growth - direction conductivity and the possibility of producing bloch oscillations , there may also be other many - body effects that are analogous to those proposed for bilayer silc systems.@xcite these includes novel effects produced by in - plane magnetic fields , enhanced coulomb drag at zero temperature , and the existence of charged topological excitations .",
    "the collective modes of miniband states are very different in character from those of a superlattice system with independent - layer states.@xcite the collective - mode spectrum of the miniband state could be explored by tunneling conductivity measurements made in a parallel magnetic field,@xcite or by resonant inelastic light scattering.@xcite    we also note that while finite tunneling is needed to stabilize the miniband state within the hf approximation , it is still an open question whether silc becomes favorable when quantum fluctuations , which lower the miniband energy , are included .",
    "finite thickness is also known to enhance silc in bilayer systems.@xcite it is also likely that the uniform ( in - plane ) density staggered states that we have considered have a higher energy than states with nonuniform densities in the plane . for example",
    ", the ( 1,0 ) staggered state may break up into domains of @xmath5=1 and @xmath5=0 within a plane , so that the average filling factor of the plane remains @xmath5=1/2 .",
    "this would reduce the hartree energy without too large a sacrifice in exchange energy .",
    "such a nonuniform state might also possess interlayer correlations at the boundaries between @xmath5=1 and @xmath5=0 regions .",
    "it is also possible that at some filling factors , in particular those at which laughlin - jastrow states occur , other types of states with silc could be realized , including states that possess both charge order and silc . while this work is necessarily incomplete in exploring all of these possibilities , and unable to reach definitive conclusions concerning the possibilities that have been explored ,",
    "it does demonstrate that the interaction physics of multiple - quantum - well systems at fractional filling factors per layer will be even richer than that of single - layer systems , if systems with sufficiently weak disorder can be fabricated .",

    "<S> we argue that broken - symmetry states with either spatially diagonal or spatially off - diagonal order are likely in the quantum hall regime , for clean multiple quantum well ( mqw ) systems with small layer separations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for mqw systems , unlike bilayers , charge order tends to be favored over spontaneous interlayer coherence . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the size of the interlayer tunneling amplitude needed to stabilize superlattice bloch minibands by comparing the variational energies of interlayer - coherent superlattice miniband states with those of states with charge order and states with no broken symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that when coherent miniband ground states are stable , strong interlayer electronic correlations will strongly enhance the growth - direction tunneling conductance and promote the possibility of bloch oscillations . </S>"
