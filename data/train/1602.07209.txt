    "throughout all this paper we fix a @xmath0-adically closed field @xmath1 . the reader unfamiliar with this notion may restrict to the special case where @xmath2 or a finite extension of it , and @xmath3 is its @xmath0-adic valuation .",
    "we let @xmath4 denote the valuation ring of @xmath3 , and @xmath5 its valuation group ( augmented with one element @xmath6 ) . in this introductory section",
    "we present informally what we are aiming at .",
    "precise definitions will be given in section  [ se : notation ] and at the beginning of section  [ se : p - adic ] .",
    "our long - term objective is to set a triangulation theorem which would be an acceptable analogue over @xmath7 of the classical triangulation of semi - algebraic sets over the reals .",

    "sim ) : :    they are bounded subsets of @xmath8 which can be    described by a finite set of linear inequalities of a very simple    form .",
    "( fac ) : :    there is a notion of `` faces '' attached to them with good properties :    every face of a polytope @xmath9 is itself a polytope ; if    @xmath10 is a face of @xmath11 and @xmath11 a    face of @xmath9 then @xmath10 is a face of    @xmath9 ; the union of the proper faces of @xmath9 is a    partition of its frontier .",
    "( div ) : :    last but not least , every polytope can be divided in simplexes by a    certain uniform process of `` barycentric division '' which offers a    good control both on their shapes and their faces .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to build a @xmath0-adic counterpart of real polytopes and simplexes having similar properties .",
    "obviously there is no direct translation of concepts like linear _ inequalities _ and _ barycentric _ division to _ non - ordered _ fields , such as the @xmath0-adic ones .",
    "nevertheless we want our @xmath0-adic polytopes and simplexes to be defined by conditions which are as simple as possible , to obtain a notion of faces satisfying all the above properties , and most of all to develop a flexible and powerful division tool .",
    "this is achieved here by first introducing and studying certain subsets of @xmath12 called `` largely continuous precells mod @xmath13 '' , for a fixed @xmath14-tuple @xmath13 of positive integers .",
    "these sets will be defined by a very special triangular system of linear inequalities and congruence relations mod @xmath13 . in particular",
    "they are defined simply by linear inequalities in the special case where @xmath15 ( again , see section  [ se : notation ] for precise definitions and basic examples ) .",
    "this paper , which is essentially self - contained , is organised as follows .",
    "the general properties of subsets of @xmath12 defined by conjunctions of linear inequalities and congruence conditions are studied in section  [ se : face - proj ] .",
    "property ( fac ) is proved there to hold true for largely continuous precells mod @xmath13 ( while property ( sim ) is a by - product of their definition ) .",
    "section  [ se : bound - fun ] is devoted to two technical properties preparing the proof of our main result , a construction analogous to ( div ) in our context .",
    "we call this `` monohedral division '' ( see below )",
    ". section  [ se : division ] is devoted to its proof .",
    "we then return to the @xmath0-adic context in the final section  [ se : p - adic ] . by taking inverse images of largely continuous precells by the valuation @xmath3 ( which maps @xmath16 onto @xmath12 ) and restricting them to certain subsets of @xmath17 , we transfer all the definitions and results built in @xmath12 in the previous sections to @xmath16 , especially the monohedral division ( which becomes in this context the `` monotopic division '' , theorem  [ th : div - p - adic ] ) .",
    "this latter result paves the way towards a triangulation of semi - algebraic @xmath0-adic sets , to appear in a further paper .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in addition to ( sim ) and ( fac ) , every largely continuous precell @xmath18 mod @xmath13 has one more remarkable property which real polytopes are lacking : its proper faces , ordered by specialisation if and only if @xmath19 is contained in the closure or @xmath18.[fo : spec - ord ] ] , form a rooted tree ( proposition  [ pr : face - egale - proj]([it : face - lattice ] ) .",
    "when this tree is a chain , we say that @xmath18 is `` monohedral '' .    among real polytopes of a given dimension , the simplexes are those whose number of facets is minimal : a polytope @xmath20 of dimension @xmath21 has at least @xmath22 facets , and it is a simplex if and only if it has exactly @xmath22 facets ( see corollary  9.5 and corollary 12.8 in @xcite ) .",
    "we expect largely continuous precells to fulfill in @xmath12 a function similar to polytopes in @xmath8 , and the monohedral ones ( whose ordered set of faces is in a sense the simplest possible tree ) to fulfill a function similar to simplexes .",
    "indeed our main result , the `` monohedral division '' ( theorem  [ th : mono - div ] ) , provides in our context a powerful tool very similar to ( div ) , the barycentric division of real polytopes .",
    "it provides in particular a `` monohedral decomposition '' ( theorem  [ th : mono - dec ] ) which says that every largely continuous precell mod @xmath13 in @xmath12 is the disjoint union of a complex of _ monohedral _ largely continuous precells mod @xmath13 .",
    "the latter result is in analogy with the situation in the real case , where every polytope can be divided in simplexes forming a simplicial complex .",
    "but the barycentric division in @xmath8 says much more than this .",
    "roughly speaking , given a polytope @xmath18 and a simplicial complex @xmath23 partitioning the frontier of @xmath18 , it makes it possible to build a simplicial complex @xmath24 by partitioning @xmath18 and `` lifting '' @xmath23 , in the sense that for every @xmath25 in @xmath24 , the faces @xmath26 of @xmath25 which are outside @xmath18 belong to @xmath23 .",
