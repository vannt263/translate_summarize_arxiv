    "<S> the interplay between electronic eigenstates , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom , combined with fundamental breaking of symmetries is currently one of the most exciting fields of research . </S>",
    "<S> it not only forms the basis for giant magnetoresistance @xcite , spin - torque manipulation of magnetic domains @xcite and the use of rashba effects for spin manipulation @xcite , but has also lead to outstanding recent discoveries of new quantum phases such as topological insulators @xcite , weyl semimetals @xcite and majorana fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while already each of these topics has initiated new research fields , the combination of several of these effects in a single material opens up a new realm of opportunities . </S>",
    "<S> for example , superconductors with sizable rashba spin splitting and ferromagnetic order would unite all ingredients for formation and manipulation of so - called anyons , generalizing the concept of majorana fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multiferroics , such as ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te  @xcite , fulfill these requirements providing unusual physical properties @xcite due to the coexistence and coupling between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric order in one and the same system . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that multiferroic ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te   inherits from its parent ferroelectric @xmath2gete  compound a giant rashba splitting of three - dimensional bulk states @xcite which competes with the zeeman spin splitting induced by the magnetic exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the collinear alignment of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic polarization leads to an opening of a tunable zeeman gap of up to 100 mev around the dirac point of the rashba bands , coupled with a change in spin texture by entanglement of magnetic and spin - orbit order . through applications of magnetic fields , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate manipulation of spin - texture by spin resolved photoemission experiments , which is also expected for electric fields based on the multiferroic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the control of spin helicity of the bands and its locking to ferromagnetic and ferroelectric order opens fascinating new avenues for highly multifunctional multiferroic rashba devices suited for reprogrammable logic and/or nonvolatile memory applications .    </S>",

    "<S> the larger the symmetry breaking , the larger the rashba spin splitting becomes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is exemplified by the giant spin splitting observed for the polar semiconductor bitei @xcite , the polar surface of srtio@xmath9 @xcite , as well as for high - z surface alloys @xcite . in ferroelectric materials , </S>",
    "<S> the inversion symmetry is naturally broken by the ferroelectric ( fe ) polarization produced by the relative anion / cation displacements in the crystal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spin splitting in ferroelectric rashba semiconductors ( fers ) can assume exceedingly high values . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2gete  exhibits record splitting values @xcite due to the very large rhomobohedral lattice distortion providing cation / anion displacements as large as 10% of the ( 111 ) lattice plane spacing ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the spin splitting of its bulk bands is intimately linked to the fe polarization , meaning that it can be switched and controlled by reversing the ferroelectric polarization direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> doping of gete with mn , ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te  maintains the rhombohedral lattice distortion and fe properties up to mn concentrations as high as 30% @xcite . at the same time , the mn spins couple to each other via free carrier mediated rkky exchange interactions . as a result , </S>",

    "<S> ferromagnetic ordering and ferroelectric symmetry breaking both lead to a spin splittings of the electronic band structure . for fms </S>",
    "<S> , the spontaneous magnetization leads to a vertical zeeman splitting of the bands ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) , whereas for fers the electric polarization induces a rashba splitting in the @xmath10  direction ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> both effects are entangled with each other , modifying the spin texture and band dispersions ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> for a basic discussion , we consider a simplified rashba - zeeman model based on a two - dimensional free - electron approximation ( rashba - zeeman gas ) in which the energy eigenvalues @xmath11 of the rashba - split bands in the presence of magnetic order are given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the band edge , @xmath14 the effective electron mass , @xmath2 the @xmath15-linear rashba coupling constant and @xmath16 the momentum - independent zeeman gap near @xmath17 . in principle , </S>",
    "<S> any orientation of the magnetization opens a gap @xmath16 near @xmath17  ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering the momentum - dependent expected values of the spin components in all directions ( see supplemental note 1 ) , only systems with magnetization parallel to the inversion symmetry breaking direction can reorient the spin of the rashba electron and open a gap in all @xmath10  directions as illustrated by fig .  1 g . </S>",
    "<S> due to coupling between the easy axis of magnetization and the rhombohedral lattice distortion , ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te  ( 111 ) films fulfill these criteria @xcite because the electric polarization and magnetic moments are colinear and perpendicular to the surface ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e , f ) . </S>",

    "<S> as detailed in supplemental note 3 , careful experimental alignment is needed for the quantitative assessment of the zeeman gap . to highlight the competing rashba and zeeman terms @xmath2 and @xmath16 for different doping levels , </S>",
    "<S> both theoretical and experimental data are fitted with the simplified rashba - zeeman gas model ( solid lines ) described above . due to the simplicity of the model that neglects the strong band non - parabolicity of the iv - vi compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the fit does not reproduce the actual dispersions but it gives direct values for both @xmath2 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe both in experiment and theory that a zeeman gap , absent in @xmath2gete , appears and widens with increasing mn concentration , i.e. increasing sample magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this is clear - cut evidence that the zeeman gap opening in the dirac point of the rashba bands is induced by the ferromagnetic order of the multiferroic system . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> this is the first experimental confirmation of the opening of a zeeman gap at the dirac point in a system with strong ferromagnetic order , which was so far elusive in magnetically doped topological insulators due to the lack of measurements justifying the ferromagnetic ordering of the dilute dopants at the arpes measurement conditions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> 3a , b the resulting values for @xmath2 and @xmath16 as a function of mn content reveals that the zeeman gap reaches remarkably high values around 100 mev for @xmath28 10% . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe that the progression of the zeeman gap is accompanied by a decrease of the rashba splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic origin of this trend is that higher mn - doping reduces the rhombohedral distortion of the ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te  lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , reduces the non - centrosymmetric arrangement of the ge cations and fe polarization ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) and thus , the strength of the rashba coupling constant .    </S>",
    "<S> a particularly interesting feature for device applications is the fact that with increasing mn doping the zeeman gap shifts towards @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this will reduce the bias voltage needed to move @xmath20  inside this gap and create a single spin polarised fermi surface reminiscent of an ideal topological insulator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the 2d surface state of a topological insulator , however , ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te  has a three dimensional fermi surface , which in the absence of ferromagnetic order takes the form of a spin polarized spindle torus @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the constant energy surface shows a strong hexagonal warping which becomes three - fold away from the @xmath29 and @xmath23 points , in accordance with the crystal symmetry . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c the 3d fermi surfaces of ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te  are shown for three different chemical potentials , taking into account both the deviation from an ideal torus due to the warping and the opening of a zeeman gap . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath30 the gap opening does not influence the fermi surface , and for @xmath31 the gap is only visible for a limited  range because of the dispersion to higher binding energy away from @xmath23 . for @xmath32 , however , the chemical potential is within the zeeman gap and the 3d fermi surface obtains a non trivial spin texture due to the presence of only one single non - degenerate fermi sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the exact consequences of this configuration require further study , but in both the 1d and 2d equivalents this leads to a template for the formation of majorana fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to spin - resolved information achieved with uv - sarpes to show that ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te  still retains the rashba - type spin splitting from the host gete , but exhibits an out - of - plane spin reorientation due to ferromagnetic ordering . according to our previous studies , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2gete  already exhibits a complex surface electronic structure where surface states coexist with a variety of bulk derived states @xcite . for ge@xmath0mn@xmath1te , </S>",
