    "stars with low- and intermediate main - sequence masses ( 1@xmath28 m@xmath3 ) evolve along the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) just before they become planetary nebulae ( pne ) . at the end of the agb phase , these stars experience thermal pulses ( tp ) and strong mass loss ( up to 10@xmath4@xmath210@xmath5 m@xmath3yr@xmath6 ) . as a consequence of the strong mass loss , the more massive agb stars ( m@xmath73 m@xmath3 ) experience a hidden  transition phase \" ( agb @xmath8pn ) , in which the surrounding circumstellar envelope ( cse ) of dust and gas is optically thick , making these stars completely undetectable in the optical domain but very bright in the ir .",
    "thus , the departure from the agb occurs while these stars are still heavily obscured by their thick cses .",
    "in addition , a fraction of this heavily obscured agb population will be converted into c - rich stars ( m@xmath94@xmath25 m@xmath3 at z@xmath100 ) , when the 3@xmath11 dredge - up is able to bring freshly produced material to the stellar surface .",
    "more massive agb stars ( m@xmath74@xmath25 m@xmath3 ) will evolve as o - rich ( the so - called oh / ir stars ) because of the  hot bottom burning \" activation , which prevents the carbon star formation ( e.g. garca - hernndez et al . 2007 ) .    from the observational point of view",
    ", tp - agb stars are found as mira - like variables with periods of up to 2000 days in the case of oh / ir stars ( jimnez - esteban et al .",
    "2006 ) and up to 900 days in the case of  extreme \" carbon stars ( kerschbaum et al .",
    "the strong mass loss and pulsation cease when the agb phase is terminated , and early post - agb stars are characterized by their non - variability status .",
    "candidate post - agb stars can be easily identified by their characteristic iras colours and the iras two - colour diagram ( see fig.1 ) is a powerful tool to discriminate between these candidate post - agb stars and other types of astronomical sources .",
    "thus , heavily obscured post - agb stars display iras ( 25@xmath212 ) @xmath12 0.0 ( those regions marked as iiib , iv and v in fig.1 ) .",
    "the obscured  non - variable oh / ir stars \" have been positively identified as o - rich post - agb stars ( e.g. engels 2002 ) .",
    "this study was prompted by the remarkable fact that a positive identification for the obscured c - rich post - agb candidates is still lacking .",
    "our sample is composed of 5 extremely red iras sources identified as candidate post - agb stars with no optical counterpart taken from the so - called glmp catalogue ( see e.g. garca - lario et al .",
    "these sources were of unknown chemistry and with no detection of oh maser emission , and thus they were expected to be heavily obscured c - rich stars .",
    "we observed our sample stars by using the irc and irs spectrographs onboard akari and spitzer satellites , respectively .",
    "the akari / irc observations were carried out from 2006 - 12 - 08 until 2007 - 08 - 14 .",
    "we obtained long and short spectroscopic exposures by using the observation mode aot04 for different dispersion elements ( np , sg1 , sg2 ) , which give a spectral resolution between 50 and 140 and an almost complete coverage from 1.8 to 12.9 @xmath1 m ( in one case we used lg2 that covers the 17.5@xmath225.7 @xmath1 m region ) . the data reduction was done with the irc spectroscopy toolkit version 20080528 .",
    "a few sources were reduced by applying the short exposure mode of the data reduction pipeline , since all long exposure frames were saturated .",
    "the spitzer spectral data were taken with irs under a general observer program ( @xmath1330258 , pi , p. garca - lario ) .",
    "spitzer / irs spectra of our sample stars were obtained by using the short - high ( sh : 9.9@xmath219.6 @xmath1 m ; r@xmath14600 ) module .",
    "the spitzer spectra were reduced with the help of the spitzer irs custom extractor ( spice ) and smart ( see e.g. garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2009 , in press ) .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of all 5 sources were constructed with the reduced akari / irc and spitzer / irs spectra ( see fig.2 ) . for all sources ( except iras15408 )",
    "we obtained almost featureless spectra ( e.g. typical of carbonaceous grains ) with a weak 9@xmath212 @xmath1 m depression ( which might be attributed to small amounts of sic or amorphous silicates ) and acetylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 at 13.7 @xmath1 m ) absorptions ( fig.2 ) .",
    "iras15408 is a particular case and it shows the 10 @xmath1 m absorption feature of amorphous silicates ( o - rich ) and no c@xmath0h@xmath0 absorption .    we have determined the dominant chemistry and the properties of the dust grains present in the cse by fitting dusty models ( ivezi & elitzur 1995 ) to the observed seds .",
    "the best fits obtained are shown in fig.2 and the derived model parameters from dusty are summarized in table 1=2500 k ) , the condensation temperature of the dust ( t@xmath15=1000 k ) , and the grain size ( a=0.27 @xmath1 m ) because the spectral shapes of the models are not very sensitive to variations of these parameters . ] .",
    "our modelling confirms the c - rich nature of 4 out of 5 sample stars , containing @xmath7 80% of carbonaceous dust .",
    "the only exception is iras15408 for which we found almost half amorphous silicate and half amorphous carbon dust .    [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "it is not completely clear , if these heavily obscured c - rich stars are still pulsating on the agb or if they have already departed from the agb , being the c - rich counterparts of the heavily obscured ",
    "non - variable oh / ir stars \" ( o - rich post - agb stars ) .",
    "the only variability information comes from the iras variability index and with the exception of iras09024 ( with a high 99% probability for variability ) , all sources are probably not large amplitude variables ( with @xmath920% probability for variability ) , and thus we identifiy them as heavily obscured c - rich post - agb stars .    from fig.1 ,",
    "it is obvious that these sources are the reddest agb / post - agb stars studied so far ( being even redder than the  extreme \" carbon stars previously known ) .",
    "interestingly , iras09024 ( probably the unique agb star in our sample ) shows the strongest c@xmath0h@xmath0 absorption ( fig.2 ) .",
    "c@xmath0h@xmath0 and other carbon - based molecules are believed to be the building blocks of more complex molecules such as pahs ( e.g. sloan et al .",
    "2009 ) , which are seen in more evolved ( and less obscured ) c - rich post - agb stars and pne of our galaxy .",
    "thus , the detection of c@xmath0h@xmath0 in our  non - variable extreme carbon stars \" is indicative of an early post - agb stage because pahs have not formed yet .",
    "we are probably witnessing the evolution of the more massive and obscured c - rich agb / post - agb stars of our galaxy .",
