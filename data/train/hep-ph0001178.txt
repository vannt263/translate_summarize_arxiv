    "a great effort has been devoted in the last few years in order to develop a deeper qualitative and quantitative understanding of systems described by interacting quantum fields out of equilibrium .",
    "there is a class of physical problems that requires the consistent treatment of time dependent mean  fields in interaction with their own quantum or thermal fluctuations .",
    "we may mention , among others , the problem of reheating of the universe after the inflationary era of exponential growth and cooling , and the time evolution of the scalar order parameter through the chiral phase transition , soon to be probed in the forthcoming heavy  ion experiments at cern  sps , bnl  rhic and cern  lhc . in these situations , a detailed description of the time ",
    "dependent dynamics is necessary to calculate the non  equilibrium properties of the system .",
    "indeed , the development of practical general techniques and the advent of faster and cheaper computers have made possible the discovery of novel and unexpected phenomena , ranging from dissipative processes via particle production to novel aspects of symmetry breaking @xcite .    from the technical point of view , it should be pointed out , first of all , that a perturbative treatment of this dynamical problem is meaningful only when the early time evolution is considered .",
    "the presence of parametric resonant bands or spinodal instabilities ( in the case , respectively , of unbroken or spontaneously broken symmetries ) rapidly turns the dynamics completely non  linear and non  perturbative .",
    "thus , the asymptotic evolution at late time can be consistently studied only if approximate non  perturbative methods are applied to the problem @xcite .",
    "quite recently one of these schemes , namely the large @xmath1 expansion at leading order ( ln ) @xcite , has been used in order to clarify some dynamical aspects of the @xmath3 theory in @xmath4 spatial dimensions , reaching the conclusion that the non  perturbative and non  linear evolution of the system might eventually produce the onset of a form of non  equilibrium bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) of the long  wavelength goldstone bosons usually present in the broken symmetry phase @xcite .",
    "another very interesting result in @xcite concerns the dynamical maxwell construction , which reproduces the flat region of the effective potential in case of broken symmetry as asymptotic fixed points of the background evolution .    in a companion work @xcite",
    "we have addressed the question of whether a standard bec could actually take place as time goes on , by putting the system in a finite volume ( a periodic box of size @xmath5 ) and carefully studying the volume dependence of out  of  equilibrium features in the broken symmetry phase .",
    "we summarize here the main result contained in @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution shows the presence of a time scale @xmath6 , proportional to the linear size @xmath5 of the system , at which finite volume effects start to manifest , with the remarkable consequence that the zero - mode quantum fluctuations can not grow macroscopically large if they start with microscopic initial conditions .",
    "in fact , the size of low  lying widths at time @xmath6 is of order @xmath5 , to be compared to order @xmath7 for the case of standard bec . in other words we confirmed that the linear growth of the zero mode width , as found also by the authors of @xcite , really signals the onset of a novel form of dynamical bec , quite different from the standard one described by equilibrium finite  temperature field theory .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the characteristics of the long ",
    "wavelength fluctuations spectrum .    since after all the large @xmath1 approximation is equivalent to a gaussian ansatz for the time  dependent density matrix of the system @xcite , one might still envisage a scenario in which , while gaussian fluctuations would stay microscopic , non",
    " gaussian fluctuations would grow in time to a macroscopic size , leading to an occupation number for the zero mode proportional to the volume @xmath8 of the system .",
    "therefore , in order to go beyond the gaussian approximation , we will consider in this work a time ",
    "dependent hf approach capable in principle of describing the dynamics of some non  gaussian fluctuations of a single scalar field with @xmath3 interaction .    before going into the details of the analysis , let us briefly summarize the main limitations and the most remarkable results of the study of a scalar field out of equilibrium within the gaussian hf scheme @xcite .",
    "first of all , this scheme has the advantage of going beyond perturbation theory , in the sense that the ( numerical ) solution of the evolution equations will contain arbitrary powers of the coupling constant , corresponding to a non  trivial resummation of the perturbative series .",
    "for this reason , the method is able to take into account the quantum back  reaction on the fluctuations themselves , which shuts off their early exponential growth .",
    "this is achieved by the standard hf factorization of the quartic interaction , yielding a _ time dependent _ self  consistently determined mass term , which stabilizes the modes perturbatively unstable .",
    "the detailed numerical solution of the resulting dynamical equations clearly shows the dissipation associated with particle production , as a result of either parametric amplification in case of unbroken symmetry or spinodal instabilities in case of broken symmetry , as well as the shut off mechanism outlined above .    however , the standard hf method is really not controllable in the case of a single scalar field , while it becomes exact only in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "moreover , previous approaches to the dynamics in this approximation scheme had the unlikely feature of maintaining a weak ( logarithmic ) cut  off dependence on the renormalized equations of motion of the order parameter and the mode functions @xcite .",
    "in this article we consider the case of a single scalar field ( i.e. @xmath10 ) . with the aim of studying the dynamics of the model with the inclusion of some non  gaussian contributions ,",
    "we introduce an improved time ",
    "dependent hartree  fock approach . even if it is still based on a factorized trial wavefunction(al ) , it has the merit to keep the quartic interaction diagonal in momentum space , explicitly in the hamiltonians governing the evolution of each mode of the field . in this framework",
    ", issues like the static spontaneous symmetry breaking can be better understood , and the further gaussian approximation needed to study the dynamics can be better controlled .",
    "in particular , questions like out  of  equilibrium `` quantum phase ordering '' and `` dynamical bose ",
    "einstein condensation '' can be properly posed and answered within a verifiable approximation .",
    "we also perform a detailed study of the asymptotic dynamics in infinite volume , with the aim of clarifying the issue of maxwell construction in this approximation scheme .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath11 model at leading order , the asymptotic dynamical evolution of the mean field completely covers the spinodal region of the classical potential , which coincides with the flatness region of the effective potential .",
    "this is what is called _ dynamical maxwell construction _ @xcite .",
    "when we use the hf approximation for the case of @xmath10 , we find that the spinodal region and the flatness region are different and the question arise of whether a full or partial dynamical maxwell construction still takes place .",
    "in section [ cft ] we set up the model in finite volume , defining all the relevant notations and the quantum representation we will be using to study the evolution of the system .",
    "we introduce in section [ tdhf ] our improved time ",
    "dependent hartree  fock ( tdhf ) approximation , which generalizes the standard gaussian self - consistent approach @xcite to non ",
    "gaussian wave  functionals ; we then derive the mean  field coupled time ",
    "dependent schroedinger equations for the modes of the scalar field , under the assumption of a uniform condensate , see eqs ( [ schroedinger ] ) , ( [ h_k ] ) and ( [ omvev ] ) .",
    "a significant difference with respect to previous tdhf approaches @xcite concerns the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "in fact , by means of a single substitution of the bare coupling constant @xmath12 with the renormalized one @xmath13 in the hartree  fock hamiltonian , we obtain cut - off independent equations ( apart from corrections in inverse powers , which are there due to the landau pole ) . the substitution is introduced by hand , but is justified by simple diagrammatic considerations .",
    "one advantage of not restricting a priori the self - consistent hf approximation to gaussian wave  functionals , is in the possibility of a better description of the vacuum structure in case of broken symmetry .",
    "in fact we can show quite explicitly that , in any finite volume , in the ground state the zero  mode of @xmath14 field is concentrated around the two vacua of the broken symmetry , driving the probability distribution for any sufficiently wide smearing of the field into a two peaks shape .",
    "this is indeed what one would intuitively expect in case of symmetry breaking . on the other hand none of this appears in a dynamical evolution that starts from a distribution localized around a single value of the field in the spinodal region , confirming what already seen in the large @xmath1 approach @xcite .",
    "more precisely , within a further controlled gaussian approximation of our tdhf approach , one observes that initially microscopic quantum fluctuations never becomes macroscopic , suggesting that also non ",
    "gaussian fluctuations can not reach macroscopic sizes . as a simple confirmation of this fact , consider the completely symmetric initial conditions @xmath15 for the background : in this case we find that the dynamical equations for initially gaussian field fluctuations are identical to those of large @xmath1 ( apart for a rescaling of the coupling constant by a factor of three ; cfr .",
    "@xcite ) , so that we observe the same asymptotic vanishing of the effective mass .",
    "however , this time no interpretation in terms of goldstone theorem is possible , since the broken symmetry is discrete ; rather , if the width of the zero  mode were allowed to evolve into a macroscopic size , then the effective mass would tend to a positive value , since the mass in case of discrete symmetry breaking is indeed larger than zero .    anyway ,",
    "also in the gaussian hf approach , we do find a whole class of cases which exhibit the time scale @xmath6 . at that time",
    ", finite volume effects start to manifest and the size of the low  lying widths is of order @xmath5 .",
    "we then discuss why this undermines the self ",
    "consistency of the gaussian approximation , imposing the need of further study , both analytical and numerical .",
    "in section [ ep ] we study the asymptotic evolution in the broken symmetry phase , in infinite volume , when the expectation value starts within the region between the two minima of the potential .",
    "we are able to show by precise numerical simulations , that the fixed points of the background evolution do not cover the static flat region completely . on the contrary",
    ", the spinodal region seems to be absolutely forbidden for the late time values of the mean field .",
    "thus , as far as the asymptotic evolution is concerned , our numerical results lead to the following conclusions .",
    "we can distinguish the points lying between the two minima in a fashion reminiscent of the static classification : first , the values satisfying the property @xmath16 are metastable points , in the sense that they are fixed points of the background evolution , no matter which initial condition comprised in the interval @xmath17 we choose for the expectation value @xmath18 ; secondly , the points included in the interval @xmath19 are unstable points , because if the mean field starts from one of them , after an early slow rolling down , it starts to oscillate with decreasing amplitude around a point inside the classical metastable interval .",
    "obviously , @xmath20 is the point of stable equilibrium , and @xmath21 is a point of unstable equilibrium .",
    "actually , it should be noted that our data do not allow a precise determination of the border between the dynamical unstable and metastable regions ; thus , the number we give here should be looked at as an educated guess inspired by the analogous static classification and based on considerations about the solutions of the gap equation [ see eq .",
    "( [ newgap ] ) ]    finally , in section [ conclusion ] we give a brief summary of the results presented in this article and we outline some interesting open questions that need more work before being answered properly .",
    "let us consider the scalar field operator @xmath14 and its canonically conjugated momentum @xmath22 in a @xmath23dimensional periodic box of size @xmath5 and write their fourier expansion as customary @xmath24 @xmath25 with the wavevectors @xmath26 naturally quantized : @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the canonical commutation rules are @xmath29=i\\delta^{(d)}_{kk'}$ ] , as usual .",
    "the introduction of a finite volume should be regarded as a regularization of the infrared properties of the model , which allows to `` count '' the different field modes and is needed especially in the case of broken symmetry .    to keep control also on the ultraviolet behavior and manage to handle the renormalization procedure properly , we restrict the sums over wavevectors to the points lying within the @xmath23dimensional sphere of radius @xmath30 , that is @xmath31 , with @xmath32 some large integer . till",
    "both the cut  offs remain finite , we have reduced the original field ",
    "theoretical problem to a quantum  mechanical framework with finitely many ( of order @xmath33 ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath3 hamiltonian is @xmath34 = \\\\      & = \\dfrac12\\sum_k\\left[\\pi_k\\pi_{-k } + ( k^2 + \\mbare)\\,\\phi_k\\phi_{-k}\\right ]      + \\dfrac\\l4 \\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}\\phi_{k_1}\\phi_{k_2 }       \\phi_{k_3}\\phi_{k_4}\\,\\delta^{(d)}_{k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4,0 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath12 are the bare parameters and depend on the uv cutoff @xmath30 in such a way to guarantee a finite limit @xmath36 for all observable quantities .",
    "it should be noted here that , being the theory trivial @xcite ( as is manifest in the resummed one  loop approximation due to the landau pole ) the ultraviolet cut  off should be kept finite and much smaller than the renormalon singularity . in this case , we must regard the @xmath3 model as an effective low  energy theory ( here low ",
    "energy means practically all energies below planck s scale , due to the large value of the landau pole for renormalized coupling constants of order one or less ) .",
    "we shall work in the wavefunction representation where @xmath37 and @xmath38 while for @xmath39 ( in lexicographic sense ) @xmath40 notice that by construction the variables @xmath41 are all real .",
    "in practice , the problem of studying the dynamics of the @xmath3 field out of equilibrium consists now in trying to solve the time - dependent schroedinger equation given an initial wavefunction @xmath42 that describes a state of the field far away from the vacuum .",
    "this approach could be very well generalized in a straightforward way to mixtures described by density matrices , as done , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "here we shall restrict to pure states , for sake of simplicity and because all relevant aspects of the problem are already present in this case .",
    "we shall consider here the time - dependent hartree ",
    "fock ( tdhf ) approach ( an improved version with respect to what is presented , for instance , in @xcite ) , being the large @xmath1 expansion to leading order treated in another work @xcite .",
    "in fact these two methods are very closely related ( see , for instance in @xcite ) . however , before passing to any approximation , we would like to stress that the following rigorous result can be immediately established in this model with both uv and ir cutoffs .",
    "this is a well known fact in statistical mechanics , being directly related to stability requirements .",
    "it would therefore hold also for the field theory in the euclidean functional formulation . in our quantum  mechanical context we may proceed as follow .",
    "suppose the field @xmath14 is coupled to a uniform external source @xmath43 .",
    "then the ground state energy @xmath44 is a concave function of @xmath43 , as can be inferred from the negativity of the second order term in @xmath45 of perturbation around any chosen value of @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , @xmath44 is analytic in a finite neighborhood of @xmath46 , since @xmath47 is a perturbation `` small '' compared to the quadratic and quartic terms of the hamiltonian . as a consequence ,",
    "this effective potential @xmath48 , @xmath49 , that is the legendre transform of @xmath44 , is a convex analytic function in a finite neighborhood of @xmath21 . in the infrared limit @xmath50",
    ", @xmath44 might develop a singularity in @xmath46 and @xmath51 might flatten around @xmath21 .",
    "of course this possibility would apply in case of spontaneous symmetry breaking , that is for a double  well classical potential .",
    "this is a subtle and important point that will play a crucial role later on , even if the effective potential is relevant for the static properties of the model rather than the dynamical evolution out of equilibrium that interests us here .",
    "in fact such evolution is governed by the ctp effective action @xcite and one might expect that , although non  local in time , it asymptotically reduces to a multiple of the effective potential for trajectories of @xmath52 with a fixed point at infinite time . in such case there should exist a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between fixed points and minima of the effective potential .",
    "in order to follow the time evolution of the non  gaussian quantum fluctuations we consider in this section a time  dependent hf approximation capable in principle of describing the dynamics of non  gaussian fluctuations of a single scalar field with @xmath3 interaction .",
    "we examine in this work only states in which the scalar field has a uniform , albeit possibly time ",
    "dependent expectation value . in a tdhf approach",
    "we may then start from a wavefuction of the factorized form ( which would be exact for free fields ) @xmath53 the dependence of @xmath54 on its two arguments can not be assumed to factorize in general since space translations act as @xmath55 rotations on @xmath41 and @xmath56 ( hence in case of translation invariance @xmath54 depends only on @xmath57 ) .",
    "the approximation consists in assuming this form as valid at all times and imposing the stationarity condition on the action @xmath58 with respect to variations of the functions @xmath54 . to enforce a uniform expectation value of @xmath14",
    "we should add a lagrange multiplier term linear in the single modes expectations @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "the multiplier is then fixed at the end to obtain @xmath61 for all @xmath60 .",
    "actually one may verify that this is equivalent to the simpler approach in which @xmath59 is set to vanish for all @xmath60 before any variation .",
    "then the only non trivial expectation value in the hamiltonian , namely that of the quartic term , assumes the form @xmath62 +      \\frac3{2l^d } \\sum_{k>0 } \\left [      \\vev{(\\varphi_k^2+\\varphi_{-k}^2)^2}-2\\left(\\vev{\\varphi_k^2 }      + \\vev{\\varphi_{-k}^2}\\right)^2 \\right ] \\\\ & +       \\frac3{l^d}\\left(\\sum_k\\vev{\\varphi_k^2}\\right)^2   \\end{split}\\ ] ] notice that the terms in the first row would cancel completely out for gaussian wavefunctions @xmath54 with zero mean value .",
    "the last term , where the sum extends to all wavevectors @xmath26 , corresponds instead to the standard mean field replacement @xmath63 .",
    "the total energy of our trial state now reads @xmath64 and from the variational principle ( [ varpri ] ) we obtain a set of simple schroedinger equations @xmath65",
    "-.4truecm @xmath66 which are coupled in a mean  field way only through @xmath67 and define the hf time evolution for the theory . by construction this evolution conserves the total energy @xmath68 of eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed that in this particular tdhf approximation , beside the mean  field back  reaction term @xmath69 of all other modes on @xmath70 , we keep also the contribution of the _ diagonal _ scattering through the diagonal quartic terms . in fact",
    "this is why @xmath69 has no contribution from the @xmath71mode itself : in a gaussian approximation for the trial wavefunctions @xmath54 the hamiltonians @xmath72 would turn out to be harmonic , the quartic terms being absent in favor of a complete back ",
    "reaction @xmath73 of course the quartic self  interaction of the modes as well as the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath69 are suppressed by a volume effect and could be neglected in the infrared limit , provided all wavefunctions @xmath54 stays concentrated on mode amplitudes @xmath41 of order smaller than @xmath75 .",
    "this is the typical situation when all modes remain microscopic and the volume in the denominators is compensated only through the summation over a number of modes proportional to the volume itself , so that in the limit @xmath50 sums are replaced by integrals @xmath76 indeed we shall apply this picture to all modes with @xmath60 , while we do expect exceptions for the zero  mode wavefunction @xmath77 .",
    "the treatment of ultraviolet divergences requires particular care , since the hf approximation typically messes things up ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "following the same login of the large @xmath1 approximation @xcite , we could take as renormalization condition the requirement that the frequencies @xmath70 are independent of @xmath30 , assuming that @xmath35 and @xmath12 are functions of @xmath30 itself and of renormalized @xmath78independent parameters @xmath79 and @xmath13 such that @xmath80_{\\text{finite}}\\ ] ] where by @xmath81_{\\text{finite}}$ ] we mean the ( scheme  dependent ) finite part of some possibly ultraviolet divergent quantity",
    ". unfortunately this would not be enough to make the spectrum of energy differences cutoff  independent , because of the bare coupling constant @xmath12 in front of the quartic terms in @xmath72 and the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath69 [ such problem does not exist in large @xmath1 because that is a purely gaussian approximation ] .",
    "again this would not be a problem whenever these terms become negligible as @xmath50 . at any rate , to be ready to handle the cases when this is not actually true and to define an ultraviolet",
    " finite model also at finite volume , we shall by hand modify eq .",

    "in fact , the @xmath84legs vertices in the curly brackets are diagonal in momentum space ; at higher order in the loop expansion , when we contract two or more vertices of this type , no sum over internal loop momenta is produced , so that all higher order perturbation terms are suppressed by volume effects . however , we know that in the complete theory , the wavefunction is not factorized and loops contain all values of momentum .",
    "this suggests that , in order to get a finite hamiltonian , we need to introduce in the definition of our model some extra resummation of feynmann diagrams , that is not automatically contained in this self  consistent hf approach .",
    "the only choice consistent with the cactus resummation performed in the two  point function by the hf scheme is the resummation of the @xmath85-loop _ fish _ diagram in the four  point function .",
    "this amounts to the change from @xmath86 to @xmath13 and it is enough to guarantee the ultraviolet finiteness of the hamiltonian through the redefinition @xmath87 at the same time the frequencies are now related to the widths @xmath88 by @xmath89 apart for @xmath90 corrections , @xmath91 plays the role of time ",

    "dependent , we have to perform the renormalization first for some reference quantum state , that is for some specific collection of wavefunctions @xmath54 ; as soon as @xmath35 and @xmath12 are determined as functions @xmath30 , ultraviolet finiteness will hold for the entire class of states with the same ultraviolet properties of the reference state .",
    "then an obvious consistency check for our hf approximation is that this class is closed under time evolution .    rather than a single state ,",
    "we choose as reference the family of gaussian states parametrized by the uniform expectation value @xmath93 ( recall that we have @xmath61 when @xmath94 by assumption ) and such that the hf energy @xmath68 is as small as possible for fixed @xmath18 .",
    "then , apart from a translation by @xmath95 on @xmath96 , these gaussian @xmath54 are ground state eigenfunctions of the harmonic hamiltonians obtained from @xmath72 by dropping the quartic terms .",
    "because of the @xmath97 in the frequencies we expect these gaussian states to dominate in the ultraviolet limit also at finite volume ( as discussed above they should dominate in the infinite  volume limit for any @xmath94 ) .",
    "moreover , since now @xmath98 the relation ( [ omvev2 ] ) between frequencies and widths turn into the single gap equation @xmath99 fixing the self - consistent value of @xmath91 as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "it should be stressed that ( [ omvev2 ] ) turns through eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) into the gap equation only because of the requirement of energy minimization .",
    "generic @xmath54 , regarded as initial conditions for the schroedinger equations ( [ schroedinger ] ) , are in principle not subject to any gap equation .",
    "the treatment now follows closely that in the large @xmath1 approximation @xcite , the only difference being in the value of the coupling , now three times larger .",
    "in fact , in case of @xmath2 symmetry , the quantum fluctuations over a given background @xmath100 decompose for each @xmath26 into one longitudinal mode , parallel to @xmath101 , and @xmath102 transverse modes orthogonal to it ; by boson combinatorics the longitudinal mode couples to @xmath101 with strength @xmath103 and decouple in the @xmath104 limit , while the transverse modes couple to @xmath101 with strength @xmath105 ; when @xmath10 only the longitudinal mode is there .    as @xmath50 , @xmath106 and @xmath91",

    "the landau pole in @xmath12 prevents the actual uv limit @xmath36 . nonetheless , neglecting all inverse powers of the uv cutoff when @xmath111 , it is possible to rewrite the gap equation ( [ rengap ] ) as @xmath117 in terms of the one ",

    "( [ renomvev ] ) .",
    "thus this class of states is indeed closed under time evolution and the parameterizations ( [ m2ren ] ) and ( [ lren ] ) make our tdhf approximation ultraviolet finite .",
    "notice that the requirement ( [ largek ] ) effectively always imposes a gap equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) in the deep ultraviolet .",
    "another simple check of the self  consistency of our approach , including the change in selected places from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , as discussed above , follows from the energy calculation for the gaussian states with @xmath122 introduced above .",

    "notice that the finiteness of the energy density difference can be shown also by a simpler and more elegant argument , as presented below in section [ ooed ] .",
    "this check would fail instead when @xmath111 if only the bare coupling constant @xmath12 would appear in the last formula .",
    "the tdhf approximation derived above represents a huge simplification with respect to the original problem , but its exact solution still poses itself as a considerable challenge . as a matter of fact , a numerical approach is perfectly possible within the capabilities of modern computers , provided the number of equations ( [ schroedinger ] ) is kept in the range of few thousands . as will become clear later on , even this numerical workout will turn out not to be really necessary in the form just alluded to , at least for the purposes of this paper .      quite obviously , in a finite volume and with a uv cutoff there can not be any symmetry breaking , since the ground state is necessarily unique and symmetric when the number of degrees of freedom is finite @xcite .",
    "however , we may handily envisage the situation which would imply symmetry breaking when the volume diverges .",

    "in fact , for any fixed value @xmath5 for the linear size of the system , we can find a whole interval of initial conditions for the mean field , which leave enough time to the fluctuations for growing to order @xmath5 , much before the field itself had rolled down towards one of the minima of the classical potential . for those particular evolutions , we would need to consider the quartic terms in the hamiltonians that the gaussian approximation neglects , as already explained .",
    "in addition , there will be also initial conditions for which @xmath304 . in that case , the effective mass soon starts oscillating around positive values and it is reasonable to think that it will take a much longer time than @xmath6 for the finite volume effects to manifest .",
    "in @xcite we have interpreted the proportionality between @xmath6 and @xmath5 as an auto interference effect ( due to periodic boundary conditions ) suffered by a goldstone boson wave , traveling at speed of light , at the moment it reaches the borders of the cubic box . here , the massless wave we have in the early phase of the evolution , rapidly acquires a positive mass , as soon as the condensate rolls down ; this decelerates the wave s propagation and delays the onset of finite volume effects .",
    "the gaussian approximation appears to be fully consistent when we limit ourselves to the evolution of these particular configurations .",
    "we discuss in this section the asymptotic behavior of the dynamical evolution as it turns out from our numerical results in the gaussian approximation .",

    "this is done by introducing the complex mode amplitudes @xmath312 , where the phases @xmath313 satisfy @xmath314 .",

    "[ fig : m1 ] or [ slowrd:0 m ] , we can see that the motions of the quantum modes correspond qualitatively to orbits with very large eccentricities .",
    "in fact , there are istants in which @xmath317 is very little and the angular velocity @xmath319 is very large .",
    "this is the technical reason for preferring the equations in the form ( [ numeq ] ) .    to solve these evolution equations",
    ", we have to choose suitable initial conditions respecting the wronskian condition . in case of unbroken symmetry",
    ", the requirement of minimum energy for the quantum fluctuations leads to the massive particle spectrum : @xmath320 where @xmath321 and the initial squared effective mass @xmath322 , has to be determined self - consistently , by means of its definition ( [ unbtdgap ] ) .    in case of broken symmetry , the gap equation is a viable mean for fixing the initial conditions only when @xmath14 lies outside the spinodal region [ cfr .",
    "eq ( [ bnice ] ) ] ; otherwise , the gap equation does not admit a positive solution for the squared effective mass and we can not minimize the energy of the fluctuations . following the discussion presented in [ ooed ] , one possible choice is to set @xmath323 for @xmath324 and then solve the corresponding gap equation ( [ newgap ] ) .",
    "we will call this choice the `` flipped '' initial condition .",
    "an other acceptable choice would be to solve the gap equation , setting a massless spectrum for all the spinodal modes but the zero mode , which is started from an arbitrary , albeit microscopic , value .",
    "this choice will be called the `` massless '' initial condition .    before passing to discuss the influence of different initial conditions on the results ,",
    "let us present the asymptotic behavior we find when we choose the flipped initial condition . in fig .",
    "[ asy : fig ] we have plotted the asymptotic values of the mean field versus the initial values , for @xmath325 .",
    "all dimensionful quantities are expressed in terms of the suitable power of the equilibrium mass @xmath154 .",
    "for example , the vev of the field is equal to @xmath326 in these units .",
    "first of all , consider the initial values for the condensate far enough from the top of the potential hill , say between @xmath327 and @xmath328 . in that region the crosses seem to follow a smooth curve , that has its maximum exactly at @xmath329 ( the point of stable equilibrium ) . when we start from an initial condition smaller than @xmath327 , the asymptotic value @xmath280 is not guaranteed to be positive anymore . on the contrary , it is possible to choose the initial condition in such a way that the condensate will oscillate between positive and negative values for a while , before settling around an asymptotic value near either one or the other minimum , as fig [ boths:1 ] clearly shows .",
    "fig.s [ energies ] , [ cond_en1 ] and [ cond_en2 ] helps to understand this behavior by consideration on the energy balance .",
    "both the evolutions are such that the classical energy , defined as @xmath330 , is not a monotonically decreasing function of time .",
    "indeed , energy is continuously exchanged between the classical degree of freedom and the quantum fluctuations bath , in both directions",
    ". however , the two rates of energy exchange are not exactly the same and an effective dissipation of classical energy on average can be seen , at long time at least .",
    "of course , this is not the case for the initial transient part of the evolution starting from the initial condition @xmath331 ; there , the condensate absorbs energy ( on average ) from the quantum fluctuations , being able to go beyond the top of the potential hill , towards the negative minimum .",
    "this happens because in case of broken symmetry , the minimization of the fluctuation energy , within microscopic gaussian states , is not possible for initial conditions in the spinodal region [ cfr .",
    "the discussion about the gap equation ( [ bnice ] ) in section [ ooed ] ] . after",
    "a number of oscillations , the energy starts to flow from the condensate to the quantum bath again ( on the average ) , constraining the condensate to oscillate around a value close to one of the two minima . if we look at fig .",
    "[ asy : fig ] again , we can find positive asymptotic values as well as negative ones , without a definite pattern , in the whole interval @xmath332 $ ] .",
    "if we start with @xmath333 we have the slow rolling down , already described in section [ ep ] and the mean field oscillates around a positive value from the beginning , never reaching negative values .",
    "a further note is worth being added here . during the phase of slow rolling down",
    ", the evolution is very similar to a symmetric evolution starting from @xmath334 ; in that case , the dissipation mechanism works through the emission of ( quasi-)massless particles and it is very efficient because it has not any perturbative threshold .",
    "if the field stays in this slow rolling down phase for a time long enough , it will not be able to absorb the sufficient energy to pass to the other side ever again and it will be confined in the positive valley for ever . evidently , when @xmath335 this dissipative process might not be so efficient to prevent the mean field from sampling also the other valley .",
    "which one of the two valleys will be chosen by the condensate is a matter of initial conditions and it is very dependent from the energy stored in the initial state , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ boths:2 ] , where two evolutions are compared , starting from the same value for the condensate , but with the two initial conditions , `` flipped '' and massless , for the quantum fluctuations .",
    "in this work we have extended the standard time dependent hartree - fock approximation @xcite for the @xmath3 qft , to include some non - gaussian features of the complete theory .",
    "we have presented a rather detailed study of the dynamical evolution out of equilibrium , in finite volume ( a cubic box of size @xmath5 in @xmath4d ) , as well as in infinite volume . for comparison",
    ", we have also analyzed some static characteristics of the theory both in unbroken and broken symmetry phases .    by means of a proper substitution of the bare coupling constant with the renormalized coupling constant ( fully justified by diagrammatic consideration )",
    ", we have been able to obtain equations of motion completely independent of the ultraviolet cut - off ( apart from a slight dependence on inverse powers , that is , however , ineluctable because of the landau pole ) .",
    "we have described in detail the shape of the ground state , showing how a broken symmetry scenario can be recovered from the quantum mechanical model , when the volume diverges .",
    "moreover , we have shown that , within this slightly enlarged tdhf approach that allows for non  gaussian wavefunctions , one might recover the usual gaussian hf approximation in a more controlled way .",
    "in fact , studying the late time dynamics , we have confirmed the presence of a time scale @xmath6 , proportional to the linear size @xmath5 of the box , at which the evolution ceases to be similar to the infinite volume one . at the same time , the low ",
    "lying modes amplitudes have grown to order @xmath5 . the same phenomenon has been observed in the @xmath2 model @xcite .",
    "looking at this result in the framework of our extended tdhf approximation , one realizes that the growth of long  wavelength fluctuations to order @xmath5 in fact undermines the self ",
    "consistency of the gaussian hf itself .",
    "in fact , in our tdhf approach the initial gaussian wavefunctions are allowed to evolve into non ",
    "gaussian forms , but they simply do not do it in a macroscopic way , within a further harmonic approximation for the evolution , so that in the infinite  volume limit they are indistinguishable from gaussians at all times .",
    "but when @xmath242 is on average not or order @xmath135 , but much less , as it happens for suitable initial conditions , infrared modes of order @xmath5 will be dominated by the quartic term in our schroedinger equations ( [ schroedinger ] ) , showing a possible internal inconsistency of the gaussians approximation .    an other manifestation of the weakness of the hf scheme is the curious `` stopping at the spinodal line '' of the width of the gaussian quantum fluctuations , when the initial configuration does not break the symmetry",
    "this does not happen in the large @xmath1 approach because of different coupling of transverse mode ( the only ones that survive in the @xmath104 limit ) with respect to the longitudinal modes of the @xmath10 case in the hf approach .",
    "we have also described the non  trivial phenomenology of the infinite  volume late ",
    "time evolution in the gaussian approximation , showing how the dynamical maxwell construction differs from the @xmath336 case .",
    "in fact , we have observed the presence of an unstable interval , contained in the static flat region which is forbidden as attractor of the asymptotic evolution .",
    "this region corresponds , more or less , to the spinodal region of the classical potential , with the obvious exception of the origin . in particular",
    ", we have found that the energy flux between the classical degree of freedom and the bath of quantum fluctuations is quite complex and not monotonous . in other words , since we start from initial conditions where the fluctuation energy is not minimal , there are special situations where enough energy is transferred from the bath to the condensate , pushing it beyond the top of the potential hill .",
    "clearly further study , both analytical and numerical , is needed in our tdhf approach to better understand the dynamical evolution of quantum fluctuations in the broken symmetry phase coupled to the condensate .",
    "an interesting direction is the investigation of the case of finite @xmath1 , in order to interpolate smoothly the results for @xmath10 to those of the @xmath337 approach . it should be noted , in fact , that the theory with a single scalar field contains only the longitudinal mode ( by definition ) , while only the transverse modes are relevant in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "hence a better understanding of the coupling between longitudinal and transverse modes is necessary .    in this direction ,",
    "another relevant point is whether the goldstone theorem is respected in the hf approximation @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting also to study the dynamical realization of the goldstone paradigm , namely the asymptotic vanishing of the effective mass in the broken symmetry phases , in different models ; this issue needs further study in the @xmath338 case @xcite , where it is known that the goldstone theorem is not valid .",
