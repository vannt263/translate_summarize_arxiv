    "the concept of frustration has been a common link among various problems in statistical mechanics for the past two decades at least . even in the absence of disorder",
    ", it often results in a phenomenon of competition between several degenerate ground - states .",
    "superconducting wire networks provide a very appealing class of systems where many subtle effects induced by frustration can be observed experimentally and analyzed theoretically  @xcite .    for simple regular networks ,",
    "a natural parameter characterizing the strength of the frustration is the ratio @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the external magnetic flux through an elementary plaquette of the lattice and @xmath3 is the superconducting flux quantum .",
    "for an ideal network of very thin wires , all physical properties are expected to be periodic functions of @xmath4 , all integer values being equivalent . in this case , the maximal frustration is obtained when @xmath4 reaches half - integer values .",
    "such fluxes are interesting because already for a single loop , they provide two equivalent ground states , distinguished by the orientation of the supercurrent flowing around the loop . for more complex geometries , two adjacent loops ( sharing a common link ) have a lower free energy when the currents in them flow in opposite directions . the possibility to fulfill",
    "this requirement for any pair of adjacent loops is a geometrical property of a given lattice , which allows one to be sure about the structure of the superconducting state without any additional analysis .",
    "this clearly holds for a square lattice  @xcite ( where vortices of alternating signs form a regular checkerboard pattern ) or for a triangular lattice .    in recent years",
    ", network geometries which do not satisfy this criterion have received a lot of attention .",
    "the most studied examples are the honeycomb  @xcite , the _ kagome _",
    "@xcite , and the dice  @xcite lattices . on the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "the discrete degeneracy of the classical ground states in fully frustrated superconducting wire networks or josephson junction arrays can be described in terms of formation of zero - energy domain walls in parallel to each other  @xcite , the residual entropy of such system being proportional to its linear size .",
    "experimentally , a cusp - like local maximum in the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 is observed as the external magnetic field is varied around the value corresponding to @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been interpreted as an evidence for a degeneracy lifting mechanism which selects a commensurate ordered pattern of vortices  @xcite .",
    "for the _ kagome _ lattice , the residual entropy of classical ground states is much larger , since it is proportional to the whole network area  @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation at @xmath6 is not as clearcut as for the honeycomb lattice , since the shape of @xmath5 versus magnetic field curves near @xmath6 depends on the resistive criterion chosen to determine @xmath5  @xcite , or on the superconducting metal ( aluminium versus niobium for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , various degeneracy lifting mechanisms have been studied in detail by park and huse  @xcite .    on the dice lattice ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , the residual entropy is proportional to the system linear size  @xcite , as for the honeycomb lattice .",
    "experimentally , magnetic decoration experiments  @xcite have found a highly disordered vortex pattern , with a vortex correlation length comparable to the lattice spacing .",
    "numerical simulations  @xcite of the corresponding @xmath0 model support the picture proposed in ref .   for the ground states , but also demonstrate , at low temperatures , an unusually slow relaxation of energy , as well as aging of phase correlation functions .",
    "in this article we consider maximally frustrated superconducting networks on a dice lattice , in the immediate vicinity of the superconducting transition temperature . in this limit",
    ", the amplitude of the superconducting order - parameter is not necessarily uniform , and it is appropriate to use a generalization of the approach introduced by abrikosov  @xcite in his first prediction of vortex lattices in type ii superconductors .",
    "the main idea underlying this approximation is that at @xmath7 , only a small fraction of the eigenmodes of the linearized ginzburg - landau equations become unstable .",
    "abrikosov developed a variational procedure where the superconducting order - parameter is constrained to remain in this unstable subspace ( for @xmath8 this procedure is asymptotically exact ) . minimizing the quartic term in the ginzburg - landau free energy functional yields then periodic vortex lattice solutions .",
    "adopting this approach to a dice lattice network is quite interesting since the corresponding eigenmodes ( for @xmath6 ) have unusually high degeneracy and exhibit the unexpected property of an extreme form of spacial localization .",
    "it is indeed possible to construct an eigenfunction basis for which each member is non - vanishing only on a _ finite _ cluster  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon arises from the aharonov - bohm interference effect which is magnified in the geometry of the dice lattice , and these _ aharonov - bohm cages _ have been evidenced experimentally by the observation of magnetoresistance oscillations in ballistic semiconductor networks  @xcite with the flux period @xmath9 per elementary loop .",
    "the main result of the present study is that in maximally frustrated superconducting wire network non - linear effects select a class of order - parameter configurations in one to one correspondence with the ground states of the fully frustrated @xmath0 model with the same geometry  @xcite , which may be viewed as a low temperature approximation for the ginzburg - landau model ignoring amplitude variations ( london limit ) .",
    "however , the inclusion into analysis of the magnetic energy leads to the removal of the accidental degeneracy and selection of one of the periodic states minimizing the ginzburg - landau free energy .",
    "the same state has the lowest free energy also at lower temperatures ( down to london limit ) , as well as in josephson junction arrays with the same geometry .    in sections  [ harmonicfe ] and  [ quarticfe ]",
    ", we express the ginzburg - landau functional for a fully frustrated dice lattice wire network after projection on the subspace of unstable modes in terms of complex variables defined on the triangular sublattice of sixfold coordinated sites .",

    "finally , section  [ selection ] investigates a degeneracy lifting due to magnetic interaction between currents .",
    "in the framework of the ginzburg - landau approximation the free energy of a thin superconducting wire , @xmath10 , can be written as the sum of the two terms , @xmath11\\delta(x)\\right|^2\\right\\ } \\nonumber % \\equiv f^{(2)}_{\\rm wire}+f^{(4)}_{\\rm wire}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath12 describing , respectively , the harmonic and the fourth - order contributions to @xmath10 . here ,",
