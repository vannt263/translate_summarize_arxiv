    "we will refer to a half - translation surface @xmath3 simply as @xmath1 .",
    "any flat surface @xmath3 in @xmath6 admits a canonical ramified double cover @xmath14 such that the induced quadratic differential on @xmath15 is a global square of an abelian differential , that is @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "volumes of strata with respect to the masur ",
    "veech measure were computed by eskin and okounkov ( @xcite ) , and by kontsevich and zorich in some low genus cases ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first authors used representation theory and modular forms , and their approach allowed them to prove the rationality of volumes which was conjectured by kontsevich and zorich , that is @xmath43 where @xmath2 is the genus of the surfaces in the stratum @xmath12 .",
    "they also computed algorithmically the exact values of the volumes of strata up to genus 10 .",
    "zorich used a combinatorial approach to compute explicitly the volumes of some strata in low genus .",

    "nevertheless , the rationality of volumes is still valid , that is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the genus of the double cover @xmath47 for @xmath48 ( cf lemma [ lem : rat ] ) .    in the case of genus",
    "0 surfaces , athreya  eskin ",
    "zorich developed two parallel approaches that leaded to the explicit computation of volumes .",
    "the first one ( @xcite ) is combinatorial and is based on a formula of kontsevich ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second one develops the study of siegel  veech constants : they give a formula relating siegel ",
    "veech constants and volumes ( based on the classification of configurations in @xcite , @xcite ) , and since the siegel ",
    "veech constants in genus 0 are known thanks to the eskin  kontsevich ",
    "zorich formula ( @xcite ) , they deduce the volumes of strata for genus 0",
    ".    independently mirzakhani proved in @xcite a formula relating the volumes of the principal strata @xmath49 with the intersection pairings of tautological classes on moduli spaces of riemann surfaces .",
    "however , up to the present paper , none of the algorithm was implemented to produce explicit values of the rational numbers @xmath50 in ( [ eq : rat ] ) for @xmath51 .",
    "the strata of moduli spaces of quadratic differentials may be disconnected @xcite .",
    "approximate values of volumes of connected components of strata of small dimension are computed in @xcite : note that for now this experimental method is the only one that provides numerical values of volumes of @xmath52 and @xmath53 separately .",
    "values of volumes of moduli spaces of quadratic differentials arise in several problems related to billiards in polygons and interval exchange transformations .",
    "in fact volumes are directly related to siegel ",
    "veech constants that give the asymptotic of the number of closed geodesics in flat surfaces , and the asymptotic of the number of closed trajectories in the corresponding polygonal billiards .",
    "furthermore , the siegel ",
    "veech constants are related to the sum of the lyapunov exponents of the hodge bundle along the teichmller geodesic flow over the stratum by a formula of eskin  kontsevich ",
    "zorich @xcite .",
    "these lyapunov exponents give precious quantitative information about the dynamics in corresponding billiards : using these exponents delecroix , hubert and lelivre computed the diffusion rate in the wind - tree billiard @xcite ( see also @xcite for series of families of wind - tree billiards ) : they show that this diffusion rate is exactly @xmath54 , so the dynamics differs radically from the dynamics of the random walk in the plane ( diffusion rate @xmath26 ) .    the explicit formulas relating volumes of strata and siegel  veech constants are given in @xcite for the abelian case , and in @xcite for the quadratic case , using the work of masur  zorich @xcite .    the aim of this paper is to provide explicit exact values of volumes of strata , in order to get new explicit values of siegel  veech constants using @xcite , and consequently new sums of lyapunov exponents . in particular",
    "this procedure can be applied to genus one surfaces ( where there is only one lyapunov exponent ) to give new results in the vein of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore this paper is the occasion to clean up all normalizations once for all , and to explain clearly how to pass from one to another , in order to make the values of volumes directly usable in any normalization .",
    "evaluating volumes of strata is related with counting problems on half - translation surfaces .",
    "this link can be useful to compute volumes explicitly in some special cases .    for the strata of quadratic differentials in genus 0 ,",
    "zorich gave an explicit formula relating siegel ",
    "veech constants and volumes of strata in @xcite .",
    "the eskin ",
    "zorich formula ( theorem 2 of @xcite ) gives here the values of the siegel ",
    "veech constants for the strata .",
    "so they deduced the values of volumes .    in higher genera , the relation between siegel ",
    "veech constants and volumes is given in @xcite .",
    "but values of siegel  veech constants are not known in general , only numerical approximations can be obtained by simulating lyapunov exponents and using the @xcite - formula .",
    "however for some special strata , called `` non - varying '' , chen and mller showed in @xcite that the sum of lyapunov exponents is the same for the entire stratum and for all teichmller curves inside the stratum . for those strata they computed the constant sum of lyapunov exponents",
    ", so we obtain the siegel ",
    "veech constants by applying @xcite - formula .",
    "all these strata have their boundary strata that are also either non - varying , or hyperelliptic and connected , or of genus 0 , so we can use the recursions given by the relations @xmath55 given in @xcite to compute the exact values of their volumes .",
    "this method is applied in @xcite for a bunch of examples .",
    "the results are coherent with those of the other sections .",
    "we first recall the @xcite - convention for the normalization of the volumes .",
    "in section [ sect : volhyp ] we compute volumes of hyperelliptic components of strata using the known values of volumes in genus 0 .",
    "then we illustrate the combinatorial approach in genus different of 0 in section [ ssection : voldim5 ] .",
    "finally we follow the eskin ",
    "okounkov approach to compute all volumes up to dimension 10 ( around 300 strata ) .",
    "most sections of this paper are written with respect to the @xcite - convention , the last section uses the @xcite - convention and gives the normalization factor between the two conventions . in appendix [ tab ] we give all volumes written in the @xcite - convention up to dimension 10 .",

    "choosing a normalization for the volume element on a strata @xmath6 is equivalent to choose a lattice in the space @xmath24 which gives the local model of the stratum @xmath6 around @xmath1 .",
    "the volume is then normalized by declaring that the covolume of the lattice is 1 .",
    "[ convreseau ] following the convention of @xcite we choose , as lattice in @xmath24 of covolume @xmath27 , the subset of those linear forms which take values in @xmath56 on @xmath57 , that we will denote by @xmath58 .    in other words the local image of this lattice under the period map is the lattice @xmath59 in @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the complex dimension of @xmath6 .",
    "this convention implies that the non zero cycles in @xmath62 ( that is , those represented by saddle connections joining two distinct singularities or closed loops non homologous to zero ) have half - integer holonomy , and the other ones ( closed loops homologous to zero ) have integer holonomy .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the volume of the stratum @xmath6 when the zeros and poles are numbered and by @xmath64 the volume of the stratum when they are not .",

    "in general , surfaces in a stratum do not share any symmetry : some of them can be very symmetric ( orbifold locus ) , but most of them are not . in some special cases ( as @xmath67 or hyperelliptic components ) , some symmetries are common to all surfaces , defining the group @xmath66 .",
    "we abuse notation by denoting by @xmath68 the cardinal of the group of permutations of the labels of the singularities induced by @xmath66 .",

    "this lemma will be useful for the computations of the next two sections .",
    "we begin with hyperelliptic components of strata : the values of their volumes are easier to compute since they are related to values of volumes in genus 0 , that are computed in @xcite .",
    "the strata of the moduli spaces of quadratic differentials have one or two connected components : for genus @xmath100 there are two components when the stratum contains a hyperelliptic component ( cf @xcite ) . for genus @xmath101",

    "the volume is easier to compute .",
    "the volumes of hyperelliptic components of strata of quadratic differentials are given by the following formulas ( in convention @xcite ) :    * first type ( @xmath107 odd , @xmath108 odd , @xmath109 ) : + if @xmath110 : @xmath111 otherwise : @xmath112 * second type ( @xmath107 odd , @xmath113 even ) : @xmath114 * third type ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 even ) : @xmath117 the same formula holds for @xmath118 .    in these formulas @xmath119 is the complex dimension of the strata .    for the five strata that are connected and hyperelliptic we obtain : @xmath120 for an alternative computation of the volume of @xmath105 using graphs , see appendix [ app : alt ] .",

    "the ramification points are over all the singularities .",
    "we introduce the following notation common to the three types of hyperelliptic components : @xmath136 with @xmath137 and @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the number of choices for the cover : @xmath140 except for the special cases ( @xmath132 ) mentioned above .",
    "let @xmath141 be the complex dimension of the stratum that we consider .",
    "recall that , by definition , the volume of the hyperboloid of surfaces of area equal to @xmath26 is given by the volume of the cone underneath times the real dimension of the stratum : @xmath142    let @xmath1 be a point in @xmath143 , and let @xmath144 be one of the @xmath139 possible lifts @xmath145 .",
    "as @xmath1 is of area @xmath26 , @xmath144 is of area @xmath27 so belongs to @xmath146 .",
    "so the cone underneath @xmath143 is in @xmath147 correspondence with the cone underneath @xmath146 .",
    "now we want to compare the volume elements of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
