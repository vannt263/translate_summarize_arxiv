    "when transitions between different zero temperature quantum phases are continuous , fluctuations occur at all length scales and lead to power law behavior for correlation functions of the order parameter at the critical coupling . tuning the temperature slightly away from zero decreases the strength of the order parameter fluctuations but as long as they remain sufficiently strong they lead to scaling laws that are insensitive to the microscopic details and , to a large degree , universality has emerged .",

    "the reason is the following .",
    "if the system were to rely on thermally activated processes to move within the restricted hilbert space @xmath9 , the characteristic time - scale would be , for a small system - bath coupling @xmath16 , @xmath17 , which is astronomical for temperatures well below the large energy scale @xmath5 .",

    "( the bath coupling should be the weakest term in order not to perturb the energy levels of the system ) , the intrinsic quantum dynamics provides the smallest dynamical time scale .",

    "\\5 ) the strong constraint on the allowed states imposed by taking the limit @xmath22 first makes the system critical in the constrained entropic limit @xmath23 with all the remaining characteristic energy scales held fixed .",
    "we call such a critical point _ a constrained entropic critical point_.",
    "the system s properties at low temperatures compared to @xmath5 are controlled by the close proximity to this purely constrained entropic critical point .",
    "ice , coloring , and dimer models provide examples of constrained entropic critical points in systems with hard constraints .",

    "even though the constrained entropic critical point may be unstable , the nearby renormalization group ( rg ) trajectories feel its presence until the rg scale @xmath28 is reached , beyond which the constraint becomes immaterial .",

    "notice that the shaded dome around the origin or parameter space contains both the classical ordered phase that onsets when @xmath8 becomes larger than @xmath293 , and the quantum critical scaling regime that is expected to appear in a cone - shaped region above the zero temperature quantum critical point .",
    "the actual details of this shaded region are highly system specific .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the existence of a zero temperature phase transition at @xmath294 is by no means a necessity .",

    "this is so , for example , in the quantum hamiltonian  ( [ eq : example 4 bis eff ] ) for any fixed value of @xmath298 , where the columnar ordered phase is stable at all values of @xmath4 according to the numerical results in ref .  .",

    "hard constraints are imposed on the system in the limit @xmath299 , that project the original hilbert space onto a space of allowed configurations satisfying the constraints .",
    "critical behavior in the @xmath299 limit occurs when correlations functions , calculated as uniform averages over all of these projected states , are algebraically decaying in space .",

    "indeed , this hierarchy among the couplings opens a rather large window of temperatures for which a constrained entropic critical regime exists as a consequence of the proximity to the constrained entropic critical point .",
    "we expect the constrained entropic critical regime to be qualitatively different in general from the quantum critical regime associated to a putative quantum critical point at zero temperature .",
    "the picture is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : general ph diag ] .",
    "the mechanism for criticality at high temperature discussed here should be applicable to some , but not all , problems with a large dominant energy scale .",
    "examples can be found in frustrated magnets , say pyrochlore antiferromagnets where a magnetic field that induces a magnetization plateau at half the value of full magnetization supplies a strong constraint.@xcite furthermore , since the order @xmath82 of a virtual process leading to the effective kinetic quantum term @xmath301 is usually large ( it is of order 9 in ref .  )",
    ", the window of temperatures for which the system is in the quantum regime can be extremely small ( @xmath302 ) .",
    "hence , in practice , even for the smallest temperatures accessible experimentally , these constrained systems should either order or be within the constrained entropic critical regime .",
    "what determines whether the system orders or not is the presence of another energy scale @xmath3 , set by the coupling strengths of additional terms in the hamiltonian that commute with the @xmath5-term imposing the constraint .",
    "another example for which the idea of high - temperature criticality may apply is that of the fluctuations about a so - called @xmath125-density wave ( ddw).@xcite in this instance , the order may form locally at some large energy @xmath303 , but the current loop directions may fluctuate .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , the system should order in a given current pattern . above the global ordering temperature , this system should display high - energy constrained entropic criticality , because it resembles an ice model as long as @xmath2 is below @xmath303 .    in the single - band hubbard model , with a strong local on site repulsion only , there is _ no _ constrained entropic critical point in the @xmath22 limit .",
    "it has been recently proposed by philip phillips and co - workers that the order in which the limit @xmath22 and the thermodynamic limit @xmath275 ( @xmath304 being the linear size of the system ) are taken has implications for hole transport in the single - band hubbard model.@xcite the issue is that , for finite @xmath5 , there is a characteristic length scale associated with the distance between doubly occupied sites , and hence for system sizes greater than this distance one has a finite density of such `` defects '' .",
    "the appearance of this extra length scale was suggested as a way to resolve the issue of the breakdown of the one - parameter scaling picture for quantum criticality in the cuprates.@xcite while we do not know how to connect their results to ours , it seems that there is one common theme , that high - energy terms find their way to affect the physics at intermediate temperatures .",
    "the chances to find a constrained entropic critical point improve if one adds nearest - neighbor , next - nearest neighbor , etc ... , couplings , i.e. , in extended versions of the hubbard model , at some commensurate fillings . for example , the presence of very strong nearest - neighbor interactions at 1/4 filling leads to a classical checkerboard configuration , where one of the two sublattices of the bipartite square lattice is filled and the other empty .",
    "if one now starts changing the doping away from 1/4 filling , extra holes or particles will tend to cluster in stripes.@xcite other longer range couplings that commute with the constraint could lead to charge ordering , perhaps in the form of static stripes or other patterns at low temperatures .",
    "now , at high temperatures , when charge order is destroyed , these stripes meander and fluctuate , and the system could be in an entropic critical regime . certainly , these are speculative thoughts , in contrast to the concrete cases of the constrained quantum heisenberg and transverse field ising models that we presented as examples of constrained entropic criticality .",
    "but the discussion suggests how it is not implausible that a constrained entropic critical point may play a role in the physics of the extended hubbard model near commensurate fillings .",
