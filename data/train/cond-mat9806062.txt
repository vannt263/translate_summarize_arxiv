    "<S> from single vehicle data a number of new empirical results about the temporal evolution , correlation , and density - dependence of macroscopic traffic quantities have been determined . </S>",
    "<S> these have relevant implications for traffic modeling and allow to test existing traffic models . </S>",
    "<S> +    with the aim of optimizing traffic flow and improving today s traffic situation , several models for freeway traffic have been proposed , microscopic @xcite and macroscopic ones @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only some of them have been systematically derived from the underlying laws of individual vehicle dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most models are phenomenological in nature @xcite . these base on various assumptions , the correctness of which has not been carefully discussed up to now , mainly due to a lack of empirical data or difficulties to obtain them . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this paper presents some fundamental empirical observations which allow to test some of the models .    </S>",
    "<S> the empirical relations have been evaluated from single vehicle data of both lanes of the dutch freeway a9 between haarlem and amsterdam ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these data were detected by induction loops at discrete places @xmath0 below the lanes @xmath1 of the roadway and include the passage times @xmath2 , velocities @xmath3 and lengths @xmath4 of the single vehicles @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it was possible to calculate the number @xmath6 of vehicles on lane @xmath1 which passed the cross section at place @xmath0 during a time interval @xmath7 $ ] , the _ traffic flow _ @xmath8 and the macroscopic _ velocity moments _ @xmath9^k \\ , .\\ ] ] if nothing else is mentioned , the interval length was chosen @xmath10min , since this allowed to separate the systematic temporal evolution of the macroscopic traffic quantities from their statistical fluctuations @xcite . the _ vehicle densities _ @xmath11 were calculated via the flow formula @xmath12 a detailled comparison with other available methods for the determination of the average velocities @xmath13 and the vehicle densities @xmath14 from single vehicle data will be given in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the _ lane averages _ of the above quantities were defined according to @xmath15 @xmath16^k \\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the number of lanes and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have the following relation : @xmath20    for reasons of simplicity , most macroscopic traffic models describe the dynamics of the total cross section of the road in an overall manner by equations for the density @xmath21 and the average velocity @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> however , one would expect that a realistic description requires a model of the traffic dynamics on the single lanes and their mutual coupling due to overtaking and lane - chaning maneuvers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this could cause a more complex dynamics like density oscillations among the lanes @xcite .    in order to check this , </S>",
    "<S> we will investigate the correlation between neighboring lanes . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ f2 ] shows that the temporal course of the densities @xmath23 and @xmath24 is almost parallel . </S>",
    "<S> a similar thing holds for the average velocities @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite . the difference between the curves is mainly a function of density ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ f2a ] ) : at small densities , the vehicles can move faster on the left lane than on the right one , whereas at high densities the left lane is more crowded than the right one . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , figure [ f3 ] shows that the variances @xmath27 behave almost identically on the neighboring lanes ( although the order of magnitude of the average velocities @xmath28 changes considerably ) . </S>",
    "<S> this strong correlation between neighboring lanes probably arises from overtaking and lane - changing maneuvers . </S>",
    "<S> it justifies the common practice to describe the dynamics of the total cross section of the road in an overall manner .    </S>",
    "<S> now we face the question , how a realistic traffic model must look like . due to the conservation of the number of vehicles , the dynamics of the vehicle density </S>",
    "<S> is given by the _ continuity equation _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the rates of vehicles which enter or leave the freeway at on- and off - ramps , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> lighthill , whitham and richards have suggested to specify the flow @xmath32 in accordance with an empirical flow - density relation @xmath33 @xcite : @xmath34 this relation has been called into question , since the resulting model can not describe the emergence of phantom traffic jams or stop - and - go traffic @xcite . therefore , some researchers have introduced an additional dynamical equation for the average velocity @xmath35 which allows to describe instabilities of traffic flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , others have interpreted these phenomena as effects of fluctuations or of phantom bottlenecks caused by slow , overtaking vehicles like trucks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence we check relation ( [ equi ] ) in figure [ f4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that ( [ equi ] ) becomes invalid above a density of about 12 vehicles per kilometer and lane , where a hysteresis effect occurs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a transition from stable to unstable traffic flow .    </S>",
    "<S> an empirical proof of emerging stop - and - go traffic is presented in figure [ f5 ] . during the rush hours between 7:30am and 9:30am , </S>",
    "<S> average velocity breaks down at place @xmath36 km because of the on - ramp at @xmath37 km . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the traffic situation recovers at the successive cross sections , i.e. average velocity increases again . in spite of this </S>",
    "<S> , the initially small velocity oscillations at @xmath38 km grow considerably in the course of the road . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to emerging stop - and - go traffic ( i.e. alternating periods of acceleration and deceleration ) . at the same time , the wavelength of the oscillation increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is in good agreement with computer simulations which show a merging of density clusters leading to larger wave lengths @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> after we have found that we need a dynamic velocity equation for an adequate description of the spatio - temporal evolution of traffic flow , we have to clear up the question , whether we also need a dynamic equation for the variance @xmath39 \\rangle   = \\theta + \\langle ( v_i - v)^2 \\rangle\\ ] ] or not . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical considerations on the basis of gas - kinetic approaches have shown that the velocity equation depends on the variance , for which a separate equation can be derived @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we will try out the equilibrium approximation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the empirical variance - density relation ( cf . figure [ f6a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ f6 ] shows that this approximation fits the temporal evolution of the variance in a satisfactory way as long as the average velocity @xmath22 does not rapidly change . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the velocity breaks down or increases , the variance shows mysterious peaks . </S>",
    "<S> these are a consequence of having built the temporal averages @xmath42 over finite time intervals @xmath43 , where @xmath44 with the actual velocity distribution @xmath45 . in linear taylor approximation </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath46 \\nonumber \\\\     & = & v_a(x , t ) + \\frac{t}{2 } \\frac{\\partial     v_a(x , t)}{\\partial t } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath47 is varying around zero , the measured value @xmath22 fluctuates around the actual value @xmath48 . for the variance </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath49 ^ 2 }   \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\overline{\\theta_a } + \\frac{t^2}{4 }   \\overline{\\left ( \\frac{\\partial v_a}{\\partial t } \\right)^2 } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , time averaging leads to a positive correction term which becomes particulary large , where the average velocity changes rapidly , but vanishes in the limit @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this correction term describes the variance peaks in figure [ f6 ] quite well . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the dynamics of the variance can be reconstructed from the dynamics of the vehicle density @xmath51 and the average velocity @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing our results , we were able to demonstrate the following by empirical data : 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of neighboring lanes is strongly correlated so that the total freeway cross section can be described in an overall way . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a transition from stable to unstable traffic flow at a critical density @xmath52 of about 12 vehicles per kilometer and lane . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . emergent stop - and - go traffic exists , so that a realistic traffic model must contain a dynamic velocity equation . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the variance can be well approximated by an equilibrium relation , if corrections due to time averaging are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions seem to be also valid for other stretches of freeway systems , at least european ones .    </S>",
    "<S> the empirical findings question the fluid - dynamic model by lighthill , whitham and richards @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are in favour of the phenomenological models by payne @xcite , phillips @xcite , khne @xcite , kerner and konhuser @xcite , hilliges @xcite as well as a recent model by helbing @xcite which has been systematically derived from the microscopic vehicle dynamics via a gas - kinetic level of description . </S>",
    "<S> the last of these models fits the instability region best , in particular the surprisingly low critical density @xmath52 @xcite . </S>"
