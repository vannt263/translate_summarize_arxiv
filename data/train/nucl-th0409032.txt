    "nuclear correlations strongly influence the dynamics of nuclear systems  @xcite",
    ". in particular , the repulsive core at small internucleon distances has the effect of depleting the shell model orbitals and inducing high momentum components in the nuclear wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the main effects of short - range correlations ( src ) consist in shifting a sizable amount of spectral strength , about 10 - 15%  @xcite , to very high missing energies and momenta , together with increasing the binding energy  @xcite .",
    "the resulting reduction of the occupation numbers of the deeply bound orbitals appears to be fairly independent of the given subshell and of the size of the nucleus , except for a slight increase with the central density of the system .",
    "theoretical studies of the distribution of short - range correlated nucleons for finite nuclei have been carried out using a local density approximation ( lda ) by benhar et al .",
    "@xcite and with many - body green s functions by mther et al .",
    "these calculations suggest that most of the missing strength is found along a ridge in the momentum - energy plane ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) which spans several hundreds of mev / c ( and mev ) .",
    "such behavior is confirmed by recent experimental data  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the depletion of spectroscopic factors for closed shell orbitals observed near the fermi energy is more substantial than the 15% reduction discussed above  @xcite due to long range effects like the coupling to collective modes  @xcite .",
    "we note that this reduction also tends to be weaker for loosely bound orbitals like halo states  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", it becomes particularly interesting to study the spectral distribution in heavy nuclei where the mean field single particle orbitals extend to regions far from the fermi level and tend to decouple from surface effects .",
    "a measurement of the spectral function for the complete mean field region of @xmath3pb has been undertaken recently at nikhef  @xcite . in this region",
    "the single particle orbitals are sensibly fragmented and it is required to probe missing energies up to 100  mev  @xcite or more .",
    "further detailed information on src could be obtained from @xmath0 experiments that directly search for the missing strength at very high missing momenta and energies .",
    "this is particularly appealing since the details of its distribution strongly influence the binding energy of finite nuclei and nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "besides , it could shed more light on how much the interior of large nuclei is sensitive to the effects of finite size and proton - neutron asymmetry .",

    "is emitted with momentum @xmath4 and different missing energy and momentum @xmath5 .",
    "due to a successive collision , a proton is eventually detected with the same momentum @xmath6 seen in the direct process . ]    unfortunately , past measurements of the short - range correlated tail by means of @xmath0 reactions have been limited due to the enormous background that is generated by final state interactions ( fsi ) , see for example refs .",
    "the issue of how to minimize the fsi has been recently addressed in ref .",
    "there , it was suggested that fsi in exclusive @xmath0 cross sections are dominated by two - step rescattering processes like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : totres ] .",
    "this becomes particularly relevant when regions of small spectral strength are probed in perpendicular kinematics   and the missing momentum @xmath7 ( as opposed to the outgoing proton @xmath6 ) . ] .",
    "a study of several kinematic conditions shows that the rescattered nucleons can move spectral strength in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , from the top of the ridge toward regions where the correlated strength is small , therefore submerging the direct signal in a large background noise .",
    "other possible contributions that involve the excitation of a @xmath8 resonance are expected to be more sensitive to transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "parallel kinematics tend to be more clean due to the high momentum that is required for the detected proton . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that the contribution of rescattering can be diminished by choosing parallel kinematics and taking advantage of modern electron beam facilities .",
    "new data were subsequently taken in these conditions by the collaboration at jefferson lab  @xcite for a set of nuclei ranging from carbon to gold .",
    "clearly , fsi could still play a role even in parallel kinematics and need to be properly addressed before the relevant physical information is extracted from the experiment .",
    "we note that a similar dependency of the fsi on the kinematics is also predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath9 reactions in superparallel kinematics .",
    "the issue of computing the effects of rescattering has been considered recently by means of the multistep dynamics approach  @xcite and by using glauber theory  @xcite .",
    "all these calculations suggest that multiple rescattering contributions ( more than two - steps ) are relatively small in light nuclei like @xmath10c but can become relevant for large systems .",
    "interference effects between fsi and src correlations can also play a role  @xcite .",
    "however , all these effects were seen to be reduced in parallel kinematics . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the scattered proton was detected at energies at which a full distorted wave calculation , in terms of an optical potential , is required . however , rescattering processes leading to the emission of two nucleons ( one of which is not detected ) can lead to the reappearance of a part of the experimental strength absorbed by inelastic processes .",
    "this effect was investigated in terms of a semiclassical model inspired by the work of ref .",
    "even if very different kinematical situations were considered , the reaction mechanism included in the latter approach is the same as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : totres ] .",
    "some partial simplifications occur for high energy protons , since the relevant effects of the medium are limited to pauli blocking .",
    "therefore this approach offers a valid starting point to investigate the fsi effects needed in the analysis of data at large missing energy and momenta .",
    "other effects such as meson exchange currents and the excitation of resonances also need to be investigated .",
