    "ultra - cold atoms have emerged as a versatile system to study quantum effects in strongly interacting fermionic and bosonic many - body systems with excellent control over the hamiltonian parameters @xcite .",
    "transport properties provide particularly valuable probes which can reveal the nature and strength of the effective interaction between particles .",
    "the shear viscosity @xmath1 , e.g. , measures the internal friction in a quantum fluid , which is lowest for strongly interacting systems . for certain relativistic gauge theories",
    "the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density @xmath2 has been computed using the ads / cft correspondence and takes the value @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that this value provides a lower bound also for a wider class of relativistic field theories @xcite , and quantum fluids which saturate this bound are denoted as `` perfect fluids '' @xcite . subsequently quantum fluids ranging from ( non - relativistic ) ultra - cold atoms to ( relativistic ) quark - gluon plasmas have been investigated in the search for a perfect fluid which saturates this bound @xcite . in the solid state context , the viscosity of 2d graphene layers has been shown to decrease logarithmically with increasing temperature @xcite coming reasonably close to the lower limit .",
    "another example is the viscosity of the unitary fermi gas in three dimensions ( 3d ) which has been measured recently @xcite and comes rather close to the hypothetical bound for temperatures below the fermi temperature .",
    "this is in agreement with calculations based on kinetic theory for low @xcite and high temperatures @xcite .",
    "these calculations have been confirmed and refined in approaches based on the kubo formula with self - energy @xcite and full vertex corrections @xcite and recently also in the form of a quantum monte carlo simulation @xcite . a similar lower bound",
    "is also seen in the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath4 which has a minimum close to the quantum limit @xmath5 @xcite again in good agreement with calculations based on kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "recently , interacting ultra - cold gases have been realized in two dimensions ( 2d ) where quantum and interaction effects are even stronger than in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "measurements for a trapped two - component 2d fermi gas with strong interactions have found the viscosity to decrease with decreasing temperature and increasing interaction strength @xcite .    in this work",
    "we compute the shear viscosity @xmath1 and the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath4 of an interacting two - component 2d fermi gas within kinetic theory .",
    "previous studies have investigated transport without medium effects on the scattering cross section @xcite and found a minimum value @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we now include medium scattering , which is known to strongly influence the dynamical properties @xcite , and find that it substantially lowers the viscosity by a factor of about three already above @xmath7 . for the spin diffusion coefficient we find a similar reduction .",

    "the model is formulated for the general case of a heteronuclear mixture with different values for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , however all numerical calculations are carried out for the balanced case @xmath19 for equal masses @xmath20 in view of the experiment @xcite . at ultra - cold temperatures",

    "this bound state is always present in an attractive 2d fermi gas @xcite .",
    "the vacuum scattering amplitude for two particles with momenta @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the center - of - mass frame is then given by @xcite @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "the scattering amplitude depends logarithmically on energy in both the low- and the high - energy limits : this is due to anomalous ( logarithmic ) quantum corrections to the classically scale invariant contact interaction @xcite .    at finite density the two - particle scattering in the presence of the medium",
    "is described by the many - body @xmath8-matrix @xmath32 .",
    "it can be calculated from the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for the ladder approximation of repeated particle - particle scattering @xcite , and in the general case of spin imbalance it is given by @xcite @xmath33 with the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "while this integral is known analytically at @xmath37 @xcite , at finite temperature we can perform only the angular average analytically but have to compute the radial integral numerically .",
    "compared to the case with the bare @xmath8-matrix this increases the numerical effort in solving the boltzmann equation considerably .",
    "we use the kinetic approach to derive the transport coefficients in our system .",
    "this approach is valid provided quantum interference effects are negligible and deviations from well - defined quasiparticles are small , which we assume in the following .",
    "this assumption is questionable for temperatures well below the fermi temperature @xmath38 and the results should be compared to calculations within a formalism which does not require the quasiparticle picture to be valid @xcite .",

    "the individual terms describe temporal variations ( @xmath41 ) , spatial variations ( @xmath42 ) , as well as external forces ( @xmath43 ) , while the right hand side describes collisions due to interactions ( or in other systems also disorder ) and consequently is called the collision integral",

    "in the case of the viscosity there is no conserved quantity which is excited .",
    "we found that , just as in the three - dimensional case @xcite , the choice for the modes eq .",
    "@xmath94 yields results which are very close to the exact result .",
    "we have checked this statement for different sets of modes , for instance @xmath95 for @xmath96 up to @xmath97 as well as chebyshev polynomials up to the same order and have found no pronounced differences .",
    "spin diffusion in a metal describes the response of a system of fermions to a gradient in a magnetic field . in our setup",
    "this translates to the two fermion species responding to gradients in chemical potentials , which are opposite for the two species .",

    "consequently , the variational approach can be employed with relatively little care and very few modes suffice to solve the problem essentially exactly . in the case of the spin diffusion",
    "this ceases to be true and the driving term in general does not decouple from the momentum mode .",
    "the momentum mode corresponds to the choice @xmath108 and if we calculate the overlap of the momentum mode with the driving term within this variational ansatz it reads @xmath109 this is zero if @xmath110 and @xmath111 , meaning the momentum mode is not excited .",
    "if these conditions do not hold the momentum mode is excited and it can not be relaxed .",
    "this formally leads to an infinite spin conductivity @xmath112 . in metals",
    "the standard situation is spin balance with a finite spin conductivity , as has been discussed recently in the context of graphene  @xcite . in the experiments under discussion",
    "two clouds of different spin species are prepared to collide in the center of the trap .",
    "if the two clouds are equal in number of particles and masses the unified cloud will reside in the center of the trap .",
    "one could excite the zero mode if one prepared different densities and/or different masses for the different spin species .",
    "the zero mode of the spin diffusion then has a very simple and intuitive physical meaning and it corresponds to a center of mass motion .    in our concrete setup in a balanced system we work with the choice @xmath113 which is not a zero mode of the collision integral and has finite overlap with the driving term .",
    "we have again checked more generic mode choices and found this to provide an excellent variational ansatz .",
    "we have obtained the viscosity and spin diffusion from the variational approach using the variational ansatz functions introduced in eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "the transport coefficients are normalized by the respective thermodynamic quantities density , pressure , and entropy density , and for consistency they all have to be computed at the same level of approximation . a definite prescription",
    "is provided by the large-@xmath114 expansion @xcite , which interpolates between free fermions ( @xmath115 ) and the physical case of interacting fermions ( @xmath116 ) : to leading order in @xmath117 , the collision integral with the full medium scattering @xmath8-matrix is consistent with using the density and pressure of the free fermi gas .",

    "the case with pauli blocking and the bare vacuum scattering cross section , including the limits of high and low temperature , has been discussed in refs .",
