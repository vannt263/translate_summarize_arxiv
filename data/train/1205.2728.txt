    "one would naively expect the two - qubit entanglement to decay asymptotically as a result of noise - induced decoherence effects @xcite .",
    "esd shows the fragility of entanglement under the unavoidable interaction with the environment .",
    "a simple model for esd is that of two two - level atoms interacting via jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonians with two uncorrelated single - mode cavities @xcite .",
    "this double jc model is schematically depicted in fig.[f : qubit - qubit ] . since the jc hamiltonians conserve the number of excitations ( atomic plus photonic ) , the model can be treated as a four - qubit network .",
    "it turns out that even when both cavities are prepared in the vacuum state the entanglement between the atoms dies and revives periodically .",
    "this behavior may be interpreted as periodic entanglement transfer between atomic and photonic systems @xcite .",
    "this model has also been extended to the multi - mode case where the atom - cavity couplings are described by a spectral distribution . for this model",
    "it was shown that entanglement can not be protected regardless of the initial states ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to study the preservation of entanglement in the network depicted in fig.[f:4qubits ] .",
    "this model may be considered as an extension of the aforementioned double jc model .",
    "we assume that , initially , entanglement is only present in subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this network ,",
    "subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) undergo excitation exchange interactions modeled via jc hamiltonians .",
    "we restrict our attention to the situation where the cavities are prepared in the vacuum state . under these assumptions ,",

    "we derived a compact expression for the evolution operator corresponding to the case of single - mode qubit - cavity interaction .",
    "this facilitates the study of entanglement dynamics for different initial states of the system .",
    "we show that there exist initial states for this network , such that the entanglement between the distant parties ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) never vanishes .",
    "additionally , we studied numerically the minimum entanglement in these pairs as a function of their initial state . in this sense",
    "we found the optimal initial states of the pairs which , surprisingly , do not turn out to be maximally entangled .",
    "we also study the emergence of entanglement in the initially separable pairs @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "+ finally , in sec.[multi - mode ] we include multimode atom - cavity interactions into our model . here , the entanglement of the qubits is studied by means of a non - markovian quantum state diffusion equations ( qsd ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , the residual entanglement in the qubits is determined in the steady state limit of the qsd equation @xcite .",
    "the analytical results obtained in section corroborate the numerical results reported in sec.[single - mode ] .",

    "the spectrum of this hamiltonian is well known @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the energy eigenstates and eigenvectors could be used to determine the time evolution of the system . however , from a technical point of view , it is more convenient to find the time evolution operator by exponentiation of the hamiltonian @xmath11 , as described in @xcite .",
    "it turns that this method may be also applied to larger system as the one described in fig.([f:4qubits ] ) . for the double jc model we have : _",

    "as mentioned before , in the symmetric scenario in which the cavities are initially in the same quantum state , it suffices to compute the reduced density matrix of one of the systems , say @xmath0 . making use of eq.([main1 ] )",
    "we determine the non - vanishing matrix elements @xmath81 the functions @xmath82 can be found in the appendix sec.[appendix ] .",
    "of particular interest is the situation where both cavities are initially in the ground state , that is @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "+ it turns out that for certain values of @xmath25 , the pairs @xmath0 and @xmath1 remain entangled at all times ( see fig.([phi - phi45 - 60 - 85 ] ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to study the minimum entanglement @xmath85 in these pairs as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "based on numerical analysis , we conclude that for @xmath86 , there is always some residual entanglement in systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as shown in fig.([minimum - ent ] ) .",
    "this result is corroborated by fig.([phi - phi37 - 15 ] ) where the time evolution of entanglement is shown for some values of @xmath87 .",
    "if we adopt @xmath88 as a measure of the robustness of entanglement , we see from fig.([phi - phi37 - 15 ] ) that the most resilient state corresponds to @xmath89 for which @xmath90 .",
    "interestingly , it does not correspond to the maximally entangled state ( @xmath91 ) . this non - trivial reflects a trade - off between the initial energy of the system and its entanglement .",

    "moreover , the initial entanglement goes to zero as @xmath25 approaches zero degrees .",

    "<S> we study a generalized double jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model where two entangled pairs of two - level atoms interact indirectly . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the case where the cavities and the entangled pairs are uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exist initial states of the qubit system so that two entangled pairs are available at all times . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the minimum entanglement in the pairs as a function of the initial state is studied . finally , we extend our findings to a model consisting of multi - mode atom - cavity interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we use a non - markovian quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) equation to obtain the steady - state density matrix for the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the multi - mode model also displays dynamical preservation of entanglement . </S>"
