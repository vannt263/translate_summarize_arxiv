    "as was realized in [ [ tb1 ] ] that parametric resonance instability occurs during reheating period when the inflaton field @xmath0 oscillates . since gravitational perturbation is coupled to the inflaton by the einstein equation , it may also experience parametric resonance amplification during this stage .",

    "the gravitational potential @xmath1 can be calculated by solving the linearized einstein equation , however , in the case of the adiabatic perturbation with scales far outside the hubble radius ( the wavenumber @xmath2 ) , it is convenient to work with bardeen parameter , @xmath3 in eq.([zeta ] ) the dot denotes the derivative with respective to time , @xmath4 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath5 is the ratio of the pressure to the density of the background . in the limit of @xmath2 , the bardeen parameter satisfies@xcite @xmath6 during the stage of reheating , eq .",

    "specifically , they have considered a inflaton model with potential @xmath10 and solved it numerically .",
    "they found that @xmath11 is constant in time@xcite .    in this paper , we extend their work and consider a general single - field inflaton potential .",
