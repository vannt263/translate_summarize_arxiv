    "in last years , two - photon exchange ( tpe ) is widely discussed in the literature . the role of tpe in the elastic electron - proton scattering",
    "was studied most thoroughly . in particular",
    ", it was shown that tpe can be responsible for the discrepancy between rosenbluth and polarization transfer measurements of the proton form factors ( ffs ) @xcite .",
    "these intriguing results have triggered a study of tpe effects in other processes , such as elastic @xmath4 @xcite , deep inelastic scattering @xcite , and so on .",
    "two recent papers @xcite discuss tpe in the elastic @xmath5 scattering . both are limited to so - called elastic contribution , and report significant increase of tpe amplitude at backward angles .",
    "these papers use different approaches to loop integral calculation : in ref .",
    "@xcite it was calculated approximately , under the assumption that both photons carry about a half of the transferred momentum , whereas in ref .  @xcite the loop integral was expressed through t  hooft - veltman @xmath6-point functions . however , the starting expression for the tpe diagram in refs .",
    "@xcite is written somewhat heuristically .",
    "in particular the ( virtual ) compton scattering amplitude , constructed in the same manner , might be not gauge - invariant and @xmath7 .",
    "it is tempting to identify the hadronic tensor , after proper crossing symmetrization , with the virtual compton scattering amplitude : @xmath8 .",
    "however with @xmath7 from eq.(8 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite we have @xmath9 instead of 0 , as required by gauge invariance . ] . in the present paper",
    "we evaluate tpe amplitude for the elastic @xmath5 scattering using dispersion - relation inspired approach , developed in ref .",
    "the positive features of this approach are ( for more detail see discussion in the introduction of ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    * no need for off - shell ffs , * clear and unambiguous definition of elastic and inelastic contributions , * correct analytic structure of the resulting tpe amplitude ( i.e. it is an analytic function with only branch cuts dictated by unitarity ) .",
    "we evaluate both elastic and inelastic contributions . following common practice @xcite ,",
    "the latter is modelled as a sum of resonance contributions , namely , @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson contributions .",
    "certainly , contributions of other meson resonances can be easily included .",
    "throughout the paper we use the notation , similar to ref .",
    "@xcite . the initial and final pion ( electron )",
    "momenta are denoted @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , respectively .",
    "the transferred momentum is @xmath14 , the pion mass is @xmath15 , the electron mass @xmath16 is assumed to be infinitely small .    in one - photon exchange approximation ,",
    "the elastic electron - pion scattering amplitude is [ 1ph ] _ fi = - |u^u ( p+p ) _",
    "f(q^2 ) where @xmath17 is fine structure constant and the real - valued function @xmath18 is called pion electromagnetic ff .",
    "since the pion has zero spin , it is easy to see that even in general case the amplitude keeps the same structure ( [ 1ph ] ) , if we neglect the electron mass .",
    "the only difference with one - photon exchange case is that the function @xmath19 becomes complex and depends on both @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we may write f(t , ) = f(t ) + f(t , ) + o(^2 ) , where @xmath22 is tpe contribution .",
    "because of charge conjugation and crossing symmetry , @xmath22 should be an odd function of @xmath23 .",
    "to calculate the tpe amplitude , we start with its absorptive part , for which we have the unitarity condition [ uni ] _ fi - _ if^ * = _ h _ fn_in^ * ( p_0 ) ( p^2-m_h^2 ) ( k_0 ) ( k^2 ) d^4k  where subscript @xmath6 denotes intermediate state , which consists of the electron with momentum @xmath24 and some hadronic state @xmath25 . we restrict ourselves to two - particle intermediate states , thus @xmath25 can only be a single meson with positive charge and negative @xmath26-parity ( @xmath27 , @xmath0 an so on ) .",
    "its mass is denoted @xmath28 and momentum is @xmath29 . retaining only the term corresponding to @xmath30",
    ", we obtain so - called elastic contribution @xmath31 .",
    "other contributions are referred to as inelastic ones .      substituting the elastic amplitude ( [ 1ph ] ) in the unitarity condition ( [ uni ] ) , we obtain |u^u ( p+p ) _",

    "the inelastic contribution is not negligible , but still smaller than the elastic one .",
    "however we believe that the former should be estimated more carefully , and no conclusion can be drawn at the moment .",
    "we also explain the behaviour of the amplitude at backward angles and @xmath82 . as @xmath3 increases , the @xmath43-channel threshold singularity approaches physical region boundary @xmath83 ( @xmath86 ) , resulting in sharp amplitude growth .",
