    "magnetic fields play a fundamental role in the physics of the atmospheres of a significant fraction of stars on the h - r diagram .",
    "the magnetic fields of early - type stars ( mainly the intermediate - mass main sequence ap and bp stars ) have quite different characteristics ( and probably a different origin ) than those of late - type stars like the sun ( e.g. mestel 2003 ) . in early - type stars ,",
    "the surface magnetic field is static on a timescale of at least many decades , and appears to be \" frozen  into a rigidly rotating atmosphere .",
    "the magnetic field is organized on a large scale , permeating the entire stellar surface , with a relatively high field strength ( typically of a few hundreds up to a few tens of thousands of gauss ) .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field strongly influences energy and mass transport within the atmosphere , and results in the presence of strong chemical abundance nonuniformities in photospheric layers ( one of our reasons for having this meeting ! ) . due its global nature",
    ", the magnetic field of ap stars can be much more easily detected and studied than that of late - type stars .",
    "therefore , ap stars represent a primary target for spectropolarimetric observations , for the development and testing of the instruments and modelling techniques , and for evaluation of physical models.ssssssssss",
    "stellar magnetic fields are detected and characterised using the zeeman effect . when an atom is immersed in an external magnetic field @xmath0 , individual atomic levels ( with energy @xmath1 , total angular momentum @xmath2 , and land factor @xmath3 )",
    "are split into @xmath4 substates , characterised by their magnetic quantum number @xmath5 .",
    "the energies of these atomic states are given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the larmor frequency ( e.g. mathys 1989 ) .",
    "as a result of this splitting , each transition that generates a single spectral line in the stellar spectrum when no field is present leads , in the presence of a field , to a group of closely - spaced lines , or _",
    "zeeman components_. for transitions in ls coupling , these lines may be grouped into two different types with different properties . those lines resulting from transitions in which @xmath8 does not change ( i.e. @xmath9 ) are spread symmetrically about the zero - field wavelength @xmath10 of the line .",
    "these are called the @xmath11 components . those resulting from transitions in which @xmath12 have wavelengths to the red @xmath13 and blue @xmath14 of the zero - field wavelength .",
    "these are called the @xmath15 components .",
    "the wavelength separation between the centroids of the @xmath11 and @xmath15 component groups can be calculated from eq .",

    "thus , both the _ intensity _ and the _ geometry _ of the magnetic field in the line - forming region are encoded in the line profile as a consequence of zeeman effect .    in the `` weak - field limit '' , when the ratio of the zeeman splitting to the intrinsic width of the line @xmath20 , under the assumption of a linear milne - eddington source function , one obtains the first - order solution for the stokes profiles emergent from a stellar photosphere : @xmath21^{-1 } \\\\",

    "( 2.3 ) will be immediately recognised as the milne - eddington solution for the emergent stokes @xmath27 profile in the _ absence of a magnetic field _",
    "- i.e. , to first order , the stokes @xmath27 profile is unaffected by the presence of a weak magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , eqs .",
    "( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) show , to first order , that the line profile is not linearly polarised for weak fields .",
    "in fact , the only first - order influence of the magnetic field in the weak - field regime is on the amplitude of the stokes @xmath28 profile . for any spectral line , the shape of stokes @xmath28 in the weak - field regime",
    "is determined entirely by the shape of the corresponding stokes @xmath27 profile , via the derivative @xmath29 . however , the amplitude of stokes @xmath28 is proportional to the intensity of the longitudinal component of the magnetic field @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that for most stars , the most easily accessible zeeman diagnostic will be line circular polarisation , and for such stars only the longitudinal field component can be practically measured .",
    "the linear polarisation stokes parameters , which constrain the transverse components of the field , will be in general much weaker ( this is a 2@xmath30 order effect ) , and consequently much more difficult to detect .    in real stars ,",
    "our ability to diagnose magnetic fields depends on various ( non - magnetic ) physical and spectroscopic attributes ( e.g. visual magnitude , s / n , spectral line depth and density , rotational velocity , spectral resolving power of the spectrograph ) , as well as the magnetic field . in many situations , the observable signal may be near the practical limits of available instrumentation .",
    "as discussed above , the most easily accessible polarised diagnostic of stellar magnetic fields is circular polarisation ( resulting from the longitudinal zeeman effect and indicative of the presence of a line - of - sight component of the magnetic field in the stellar photosphere ( a longitudinal magnetic field ) ) .",
    "typically , zeeman circular ( or linear ) polarimetry is obtained _ differentially _ , by recording two orthogonal ( circular or linear ) polarisation states , separated using a @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) retarder and a polarising beamsplitter ) simultaneously on a ccd .",
    "the sum of the recorded fluxes gives the natural light spectrum ( stokes @xmath27 ) , whereas their difference gives the net circularly ( or linearly ) polarised flux ( stokes @xmath28 or @xmath33 ) .",
    "this procedure is described in some detail by e.g. bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "zeeman circular polarimetry has the advantage of being sensitive even under conditions of moderate or rapid stellar rotation . using metal lines ,",
    "practical sensitivity up to about 60  @xmath34 can be achieved for ap stars with strong fields ( e.g. wade et al .",
    "2000a ) objects , metallic line spectropolarimetry can exploit stellar rotation to allow detection of magnetic fields _ even when the mean longitudinal magnetic field is null _",
    "( see e.g. shorlin et al .",
    "see also fig .",
    "1 ) . ] . when metallic - line spectropolarimetry is coupled with the powerful least - squares deconvolution multi - line technique ( lsd , donati et al .",
    "1997 , fig .",
    "2 ) , remarkably high precision can be attained , particularly for cooler a stars . using intrinsically broad lines such as balmer lines",

    "the first systematic observations of the transverse zeeman effect in a stars were obtained by leroy and collaborators ( e.g. leroy 1995 ) during the early 1990s .",
    "these authors measured time variations of low levels of linear polarisation in the broadband light of ap stars , produced as a result of saturation of zeeman - broadened metallic absorption lines .",
    "more recently , observations of transverse zeeman effect _ within _ spectral absorption lines has become possible ( wade et al .",
    "2000b obtained high - resolution observations of several stars using the musicos spectropolarimeter at pic du midi observatory ) .",
    "in this section we describe the current state of understanding of selected properties of magnetic upper main sequence stars , as inferred using the methods described above .",
    "spectroscopic , polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observations of intermediate - mass stars generally imply the presence of static , globally - ordered magnetic fields with important dipole components , tilted with respect to the stellar rotational axis .",
    "the tilt of the dipole axis has been found to correlate rather strongly with stellar rotational period ( landstreet & mathys 2000 ) , with the most slowly - rotating stars exhibiting nearly aligned magnetic and rotational axis , whereas more rapidly rotating stars show much larger tilt angles .    historically , a few clear examples of departures of the large - scale field from a ( centred or decentred ) dipolar configuration have been reported ( e.g. borra & landstreet ( 1980 ) , thompson & landstreet 1985 , mathys & lanz 1997 ) .",
    "the particular case of the helium - strong star hd 37776 ( thompson & landstreet 1985 ) deserves special attention .",
    "this star displays a clearly double - peaked longitudinal magnetic field variation , which was argued by thompson & landstreet ( and later by bohlender 1988 ) as the signature of a dominantly quadrupolar magnetic field .",
    "one striking difference as compared to lower main sequence stars is the near - unity filling factor and low field intensity contrast of upper main sequence magnetic stars .",
    "significantly , the presence of weak fields occupying an important fraction of the stellar surface ( and therefore a filling factor substantially different from unity ) can be ruled out using magnetically - split spectral lines ( mathys et al .",
    "1997 ) and the magnetic doppler imaging method ( e.g. piskunov & kochukhov 2002 ) .    in recent years , various authors have used increasingly sophisticated data to demonstrate more generally the limitations of an axisymmetric dipolar configuration ( leroy et al .",
    "1995 , bagnulo et al .",
    "most recently , modelling of high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio stokes @xmath35 line profiles using magnetic doppler imaging ( mdi ) by kochukhov et al .",
    "( 2004 , and in preparation ) has yielded high - resolution maps of the surface magnetic field topologies of two ap stars , 53 cam and @xmath36  cvn . as described in the paper by kochukhov in this volume ,",
    "although the surface magnetic field structure of @xmath36  cvn displays only mild departures from a dipolar configuration ( in both intensity and topology ) , 53 cam shows small - scale structure in the intensity of its surface magnetic field that was totally unexpected based on low - resolution global field models .",
    "these results suggest that there exists significant diversity in the surface structure of magnetic fields of intermediate - mass stars - diversity that can only be studied using high - resolution spectropolarimetric measurements and surface imaging techniques such as mdi .",
    "past searches for magnetic fields in a and b type stars have strongly suggested that a `` magnetic dichotomy '' exists on the upper main sequence : that the ap and bp stars ( about 5% of the main sequence stars between about f0 and b0 ) host magnetic fields , whereas the rest do not .",
    "a few non - ap stars have been suggested to host magnetic fields ( e.g. lanz & mathys 1993 ) , but such claims were never confirmed .",
    "more recently , based on a survey of line circular polarisation in a sample of 74 a and b - type stars , shorlin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) concluded that ordered magnetic fields must be very rare or completely non - existent in non - ap / bp intermediate - mass stars .",
    "they were able to obtain only upper limits for all non - ap / bp stars in their sample ( no fields were detected in any of these objects ) , constraining the longitudinal magnetic fields of about 13 stars to under 10 g , and about twice that many to be under 20 g. significantly , shorlin et al .",
    "were also able to rule out the presence of complex magnetic field topologies , similar to those of active late - type stars , based on their velocity - resolved stokes @xmath28 profiles .",
    "this study provides very strong evidence that the majority of a and b stars do not display any evidence of magnetic fields in their photospheres . on the other hand , recent investigations by aurire et al .",
    "( this volume ) , who observed a sample of bright , spectroscopically - classified ap / bp stars in which magnetic fields have generally never been detected , demonstrate that all ap stars , when observed with sufficient precision , show evidence for ordered magnetic fields with surface intensities of at least @xmath37  g ( approximately the equipartition field in the photosphere around @xmath38 ; see fig .",
