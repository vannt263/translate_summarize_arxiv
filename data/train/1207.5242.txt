    "<S> we establish a set of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions in the ising model driven under monochromatic nonadiabatic modulation of the transverse field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that besides the ising - like critical behavior , the system exhibits an anisotropic transition which is absent in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the nonequilibrium quantum phases correspond to states which are synchronized with the external control in the long - time dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the more intriguing hallmarks of many - body systems is that at zero temperature quantum fluctuations can drive the system to a drastic change of state , commonly known as a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> a paradigmatic model for qpts is the one - dimensional ising model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , experimental realizations of one - dimensional spin chains have been suggested , where a quantum simulation of the system close to the phase transition is possible , and a wide freedom on the control of the parameters is achieved @xcite . the quantum control of many - body systems by a driving field has attracted considerable interest , both theoretical and experimental , with workers from very different communities beginning to look at driven models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of manipulating the quantum state of a system by means of a classical external control allows one to explore novel states of matter and effective interactions which are absent in equilibrium @xcite . in the presence of an external control , quantum resonances and symmetries play an important role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as a consequence of a generalized parity in the extended hilbert space @xcite , under the effect of periodic driving the tunneling can be slowed down or totally suppressed in a perfect coherent way , a phenomenon commonly referred to as coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rather recently , the extension of this concept to many - body systems has been addressed in the context of the mott - insulator - superfluid transition in ultracold systems both theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite , and in a two - mode bose - hubbard model with time - dependent self - interaction strength @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of one - dimensional spin chains has been addressed extensively when the system is driven slowly through the critical point @xcite , where there is a diverging relaxation time and correlation length , and the dynamics can not be adiabatic in the thermodynamic limit . as a consequence of this , the final state of the system consists of ordered domains whose finite size depend upon the velocity of the parameter variation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a nontrivial oscillation of the magnetization @xcite and the connection between symmetry and cdt @xcite has been investigated in a finite size periodically - driven ising model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , under the effect of a nonadiabatic external control of the transverse field , the ising chain exhibits dynamical freezing of the response @xcite , and synchronization with the external driving in the asymptotic dynamics as a consequence of destructive interference in time @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim in this paper is to describe the nonequilibrium behavior of a one - dimensional ising model under the effect of a nonadiabatic monochromatic transverse field from the perspective of quantum criticality . in particular , we describe the dynamics by means of an effective hamiltonian which simulates the dynamics of an undriven system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the asymptotic dynamics the nonequilibrium quantum phases correspond to states of the system which are synchronized with the driving . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous works @xcite , however , we describe the role of many - body cdt in the critical behavior by investigating signatures of criticality both in the laboratory frame as well as in the rotating frame .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sectioni ] we discuss the equations of motion and describe quantum resonances by considering the excitation spectrum of the undriven system . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sectionii ] we describe the physics of the system by means of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and discuss signatures of criticality based on the description of the quasienergy dispersion and cdt . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sectioniii ] we describe the quantum dynamics in the laboratory frame by considering the quantum evolution of the system when it is initialized in a paramagnetic ground state . furthermore , we study signatures of criticality by considering cycle - averaged expectation values of physical observables . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a discussion of the results is presented in sec . </S>",
