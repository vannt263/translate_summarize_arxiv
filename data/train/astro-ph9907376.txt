    "after 30 years since their detection by the vela satellites , we just now start to understand the physics of gamma  ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "this has been made possible by the precise location of the wide field camera ( wfc ) of @xmath3sax , which allowed the detection of their x  ray afterglow emission ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) and the optical follow up observations , leading to the discovery that they are cosmological sources ( van paradijs et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the huge energy and power releases required by their cosmological distances support the fireball scenario ( cavallo & rees 1978 ; rees & mszros 1992 ; mszros & rees 1993 ) , even if we do not know yet which kind of progenitor makes the grb phenomenon .",
    "the most accepted picture for the burst and afterglow emission is the internal / external shock scenario ( rees & mszros 1992 ; rees & mszros 1994 ; sari & piran 1997 ) . according to this scenario , the burst emission is due to collisions of pairs of relativistic shells ( internal shocks ) , while the afterglow is generated by the collisionless shocks produced by shells interacting with the interstellar medium ( external shocks ) .",
    "the @xmath0ray light curves show an extremely variable emission , with variability timescales as short as a few milliseconds .",
    "this , coupled with the huge powers involved , requires that the emitting plasma is moving at relativistic speeds , with bulk lorentz factors @xmath4 , to avoid strong suppression of high energy @xmath0rays due to photon  photon collisions .",
    "indeed , all the radiation we see is believed to come from the transformation of ordered kinetic energy of the fireball into random energy .",
    "this must however happen at some distance from the explosion site , to allow the shells to be transparent to the produced radiation .",
    "fiducial numbers for these distances are @xmath5@xmath6 cm for the internal shocks , and @xmath7 cm for external ones .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that internal and external shocks can amplify seed magnetic fields and accelerate electrons to relativistic random energies . if this is the case , then the main radiation mechanism is the synchrotron process , responsible for both the @xmath0ray and for the afterglow emission .",
    "there are strong evidences that this is the main process operating during the afterglow : the power law decay of the flux with time , the observed power law energy spectra ( for reviews see piran 1999 ; mszros 1999 ) , and the recently detected linear optical polarization in grb 990510 ( covino et al . 1999 ,",
    "wijers et al .",
    "1999 ) .    for the bursts itself ,",
    "the main evidence is the prediction of the typical energy at which the observed spectrum peaks , in a @xmath8 representation .",
    "however , the very same synchrotron shock scenario ( iss ) inevitably predicts very fast radiative cooling of the emitting particles , with a resulting severe disagreement between the predicted and the observed spectrum ( ghisellini , celotti & lazzati 1999 , see also cohen et al .",
    "1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; chiang 1999 ) .    in the following , after having briefly recalled some basic facts concerning grbs , i will discuss the problems with the synchrotron interpretation of the @xmath0ray emission and some possible alternatives .",
    "another hot issue in the grb field is the possible collimation of their emitting plasma , leading to anisotropic emission able to relax the power requirements , at the expense of an increased burst event rate .",
    "i will show that in this respect polarization studies could be crucial , since there can be a link between the deceleration of a _ collimated _ fireball , the time behavior of the polarized flux and its position angle , and the light curve of the total flux .",
    "_ duration  _ the duration distribution is clearly bimodal .",
    "_ short _ burst durations range between 0.01 to 2 seconds .",
    "_ long _ burst last from 2 to a few hundred seconds .",
    "all information derived from the precise location of grbs refer to _ long _ bursts .",
    "there is some indication that short bursts may have a different @xmath9 ( tavani 1998 )",
    ".    0.2 true cm _ spectra and fluences  _ most @xmath0ray fluences ( i.e. the flux integrated over the duration of the burst ) are in the range @xmath10@xmath11 erg @xmath12 .",
    "grb spectra are very hard , and can be fitted by two smoothly connected power laws , implying a peak ( in a @xmath13@xmath8 plot ) at an energy @xmath14 of a few hundreds kev .",
    "below @xmath14 the spectrum has a slope @xmath15 in the range [ @xmath161 , @xmath170.5 ] ( preece et al .",
    "1998 , lloyd & petrosian 1999 ; @xmath18 ) .",
    "this spectral index varies during the burst , as does @xmath14 .",
    "the general trend is that the spectrum softens , and @xmath14 decreases , with time .",
    "more precise statements must however wait for larger area detectors , since what we inevitably do , at present , is to fit a time integrated spectrum of a very rapidly variable source : the minimum integration time is @xmath191 second for the strongest bursts , while the variability timescales can be hundreds of times shorter .",
    "some bursts have been detected at very large @xmath0rays energies ( @xmath20 100 mev ) ( see the review by fishman & meegan 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "0.2 true cm _ x  ray afterglow ",
    "_ nearly all of the burst detected by the bepposax grbm and wfc , and that could be followed with the narrow field instruments of bepposax a few ( 610 ) hours after the event , showed an x  ray afterglow , whose flux decays in time as a power law .",
    "0.2 true cm _ optical afterglow  _ for about 2/3 of the bursts with good locations an optical afterglow has been detected .",
    "the monochromatic flux decreases in time as a power law @xmath21 , with @xmath22 in the range 0.82 .",
    "remarkably , grb 990123 has been detected by the robotic telescope rotse 22 seconds after the @xmath0ray trigger at @xmath23 , reaching @xmath24 47 seconds after the trigger ( akerlof & mckay 1999 ) .",
    "usually , the magnitudes of the optical afterglow detected a few hours from the event are in the range 1821 .",
    "0.2 true cm _ radio afterglow ",
    "_ a few bursts showed radio emission , usually some time ( @xmath19days ) after the burst event .",
    "violent radio flux variations in grb 970508 ( frail et al . 1997 ) and grb 980329 ( taylor et al . 1998 ) have been interpreted as due to interstellar scintillation , effective if the source is extremely compact .",
    "transition from the phase of violent activity to a more quiescent phase has been interpreted as due to the expansion of the radio emitting source , beautifully confirming the relativistic expansion hypothesis .",
    "0.2 true cm _ redshifts  _ up to july 15 , 1999 , we know the redshift of 8 grbs , with an additional one ( grb 980329 ) estimated by a cut - off in the spectrum interpreted as @xmath25 absorption ( fruchter 1999a ) , and another one ( grb 980425 ) of controversial identification with the supernova sn1998bw . in table 1 we list some observed characteristics of the grbs of known redshifts , and fig .",

    "the energy involved in @xmath0ray burst explosions is huge .",
    "no matter in which form the energy is initially injected , a quasi  thermal equilibrium between matter and radiation is reached , with the formation of electron  positron pairs accelerated to relativistic speeds by the high internal pressure .",
    "this is a _",
    "fireball_. when the temperature of the radiation ( as measured in the comoving frame ) drops below @xmath1950 kev the pairs annihilate faster than the rate at which are produced .",
    "but the presence of even a small amount of barions , corresponding to only @xmath29 , makes the fireball opaque to thomson scattering : the internal radiation thus continues to accelerate the fireball until most of its initial energy has been converted into bulk motion . after this phase",
    "the fireball expands at a constant speed and at some point becomes transparent .",
    "if the central engine is not completely impulsive , but works intermittently , it can produce many shells ( i.e. many fireballs ) with slightly different lorentz factors .",
    "late but faster shells can catch up early slower ones , producing shocks which give rise to the observed burst emission . in the meantime ,",
    "all shells interact with the interstellar medium , and at some point the amount of swept up matter is large enough to decelerate the fireball and produce other radiation which can be identified with the afterglow emission observed at all frequencies .",
    "in the comoving frame of the faster shell , protons of the other shell have an energy density @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the bulk lorentz factor of the slower shell measured in the rest frame of the other .",
    "the magnetic energy density @xmath32 can be amplified to values close to equipartition with the proton energy density , @xmath33 .",
    "the proton density of the shell can be estimated by its kinetic power : @xmath34 , yielding @xmath35 .",
    "also each electron can share a fraction of the available energy , and if there is one electron for each proton , namely _ if electron ",
    "positron pairs are not important _ , then @xmath36 .",
    "these simple hypotheses lead to a predicted observed synchrotron frequency @xmath37 in very good agreement with observations .",
    "note that the ` equipartition coefficients ' , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , must be close to unity for the observed value of @xmath14 to be recovered . in turn",
    "this also implies / requires that pairs can not significantly contribute to the lepton density .",
    "the synchrotron process is a very efficient radiation process . with the strong magnetic fields required to produce the observed @xmath0rays , the synchrotron cooling",
    "time is therefore very short .",
    "as pointed out by ghisellini , celotti & lazzati ( 1999 ) , the cooling time ( in the observer frame ) can be written as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the radiation energy density",
    ". since the shortest integration times are of the order of 1 s , the observed spectrum is _ always _ the time integrated spectrum produced by a rapidly cooling particle distribution .    since @xmath42 , in order to conserve the particle number , the instantaneous cooling distribution has to satisfy @xmath43 . when integrated over time , the contribution from particles with different lorentz factors is ` weighted ' by their cooling timescale @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the predicted ( integrated ) flux spectrum is @xmath45 , extending from @xmath191 kev to @xmath46mev energies .",
    "we thus conclude that , within the assumptions of the iss , a major problem arises in interpreting the observed spectra as synchrotron radiation .",
    "ghisellini , celotti & lazzati ( 1999 ) have discussed possible ` escape routes ' , such as deviations from equipartition , fastly changing magnetic fields , strong cooling by adiabatic expansion and re  acceleration of the emitting electrons .",
    "none of these possibilities help .",
    "the drawn conclusion is that the burst emission is probably produced by another radiation process .",
    "an alternative is quasi thermal comptonization ( ghisellini & celotti 1999 ; liang 1997 , thompson 1994 ) .",
    "why do grb spectra peak at a few hundreds kev ? this must be due to a quite robust mechanism and/or a feedback process . the fact that @xmath47 is close to @xmath48 is tempting .",
    "i discuss below three possibilities .",
    "assume that the main emission process is quasi thermal comptonization ( ghisellini & celotti 1999 ) by a distribution of electrons ( and positrons ) peaked at subrelativistic energies ( not necessarily thermal ) .",
    "photons produced above the pair production threshold get absorbed and create pairs .",
    "this process has been extensively studied in the past assuming thermal particles , steady state and pair equilibrium ( equal pair production and annihilation rates ) .",
    "the main result is that for compact sources the maximum temperature is constrained in a narrow range [ 30300 kev ] ( svensson 1982 , 1984 ) : for increasing luminosities the equilibrium pair density increases , more particles are then sharing the available energy , making the temperature to decrease .",
    "if an high energy tail is present , more photons are created above the threshold for pair production with respect to the case of a pure maxwellian , and thus pairs become important for temperatures smaller than in the completely thermal case ( see e.g. stern 1999 ) .",
    "brainerd ( 1994 ) linked the typical high energy cut  off of grbs to the effect of down  scattering : photons with energies much larger than @xmath48 pass undisturbed through a scattering medium because of the reduction with energy of the klein nishina cross section , while photons with energies just below @xmath48 interact , and their energy after the scattering is reduced .",
    "the net effect is to produce a  downscattering hole \" in the spectrum , between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the attractive feature of this model is that the cut  off energy",
    "is associated with @xmath48 .",
    "the difficulty is that a significant part of the power originally radiated by the burst goes into heating ( by the compton process ) of the scattering electrons .",
    "suppose that the circumburst material has a density @xmath51 and that , close to the burst emission site ( i.e. between @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , the scattering optical depth is @xmath54 .",
    "this material scatters back a fraction @xmath55 of the burst power . if we require that the primary spectrum is not modified by photon ",
    "photon absorption , the optical depth of the scattering matter and its density must be ( ghisellini & celotti 1999 ) @xmath56 this requirement is particularly severe , especially in the case of bursts originating in dense stellar forming regions . on the other hand , photon ",
    "photon opacity may be an important ingredient to shape the spectrum , and _ the _ reason why grb spectra peak at around 300 kev .",
    "the pairs created ahead of the fireball radiate their energy in a short time , and are re  accelerated by the incoming fireball .",
    "the net effect may be simply to increase the density of the radiating particles , introducing a feedback process : an increased density lowers the effective temperature @xmath57 less energy is radiated above @xmath58 @xmath57 the number of pairs produced via the  mirror \" process decreases @xmath57 the new pair density decreases , and so on .",
    "another feedback is introduced by the fact that the photons scattered back to the emitting shell will increase the number of seed photons and the radiative cooling rate , softening the spectrum .",
    "covino et al . ( 1999 ) and wijers et al . ( 1999 ) detected a small , but highly significant , degree of linear polarization of the optical afterglow of grb 990510 : @xmath59% 18.5 and 20.5 hours after the burst , respectively .",
    "= 8.5 cm    to produce some polarized light some _ asymmetry _ is required .",
    "in particular , if the radiation is due to the synchrotron process , the magnetic field can not be completely tangled , but must have some degree of order .",
    "prior of the observational discovery , there have been theoretical studies predicting a larger degree of polarization ( @xmath60 : gruzinov & waxman 1999 ) due to causally disconnected region of maximally ordered magnetic field .",
    "since the number @xmath61 of these regions is limited , the resulting polarization is of the order of @xmath62 , where 60% is the value reached in each single subregion .",
    "this model requires a perfectly ordered magnetic field , on a scale that increases in time at almost the speed of light .",
    "we ( ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ) have instead considered an alternative scenario , in which the required asymmetry is due to field compression and light aberration .",
    "following laing ( 1980 ) , assume to compress a region embedded in an completely tangled magnetic field . after compression , the region becomes a slab : the field is  squeezed \" in one direction , and appears again completely random for face  on observes ( with respect to the direction of compression ) , but highly ordered to edge  on observers .",
    "photons emitted in the plane of the slab can then be highly polarized .",
    "if the slab moves with lorentz factor @xmath63 , those photons emitted in the slab plane ( perpendicularly to the direction of motion ) are aberrated in the observer frame , and make an angle @xmath64 with respect to the slab velocity .",
    "observer looking at the moving slab at this angle will detect a large degree of optical polarization .    consider a fireball collimated into a cone of semi  aperture angle @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 be the angle between the cone axis and the line of sight . as long as @xmath67 , the observer receive radiation from a circle",
    "entirely contained in the jet .",
    "there is no asymmetry , and no polarization .",
    "but when @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , some position angles are not canceled , and some polarization survives .",
    "the degree of polarization as a function of time is shown in fig .",
    "3 : note the two maxima ( a third could be present if one considers side expansion of the jet which we neglected , see sari 1999 ) .",
    "the position angles of the two maxima are orthogonal between each other .",
    "3 also shows the light curve of the total flux , to illustrate the tight link that this model predicts between the existence of polarization and the gradual steepening of the light curve .    should these ideas be confirmed",
    ", we would have a very powerful tool to know the degree of collimation of the fireball , and hence the true total emitted power .",
    "our knowledge of gamma ",
    "ray bursts had a quantum leap in the last two years .",
    "but we do not know yet what is their main cause ( i.e. their progenitors , see the review by vietri 1999 , this volume ) , if it is the same for short and long bursts , what is the main radiation process of the burst , why their spectrum peaks at a well defined energy .",
    "but the information in hand lead us to expect that they could be perfect cosmological probes , doing , for redshifts greater than 5 , what quasars have done for lower redshifts .",
    "therefore there is a double interest to pursue grb research : to understand their nature and to use them to test the distant universe .    for these reasons",
    "another quantum leap is necessary , and it is foreseen to come from the launch of a dedicated nasa  midex satellite , called swift , able to detect more than 100 burst per year and to slew to them with x  ray and optical  uv telescopes _ in less than 50 seconds ! _ ( see the dedicated web page at _ http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/_ ) . with these capabilities",
    ", we will be able to have a large sample of accurate locations , and then , after the optical follow ",
    "up from the ground , we will have a large number of redshifts .",
    "we will study the relatively soft x  ray emission [ 0.110 kev ] and the optical emission while the burst is still on , and we will know the transition between the burst proper and the afterglow .",
    "definitive approval of the mission is expected in the fall of 1999 , and launch is foreseen for the year 2003 .",
    "the italian community is deeply involved and will provide the x ",
    "ray mirrors , developed by the brera observatory , and the malindi ground station , developed by asi for _ beppo_sax .",
    "we think that this mission , besides being a cornerstone for the study of gamma  ray bursts , will be a great opportunity for the italian community at large ."
