    "the experimental observation of the @xmath1 [ 1 ] and @xmath2 [ 2 ] processes opened a window to study possible rare @xmath3 meson decays , which will give important information about cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements . in the standard model rare @xmath4 decay",
    "is forbidden due to the helicity conservation . when photon is emitted from structure dependent part ( see below )",
    "the helicity conservation allows the decay @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the @xmath6 rare decay becomes interesting .",
    "the main interest in studying @xmath3 meson decays is to test the standard model ( sm ) predictions at loop level and extract new physics effects beyond the sm .",
    "the loop induced rare decays @xmath7  within the sm have been studied using constituent quark model and pole model and the branching ratios are found to be @xmath8 for @xmath9  and @xmath10 @xmath11 [ 3 ] .",
    "the decay rate of the @xmath12 might have an enhancement comparing with the pure leptonic modes of @xmath3 meson .",
    "the new physics effects beyond sm can be also probed by studying this @xmath13 rare decay properties .    in this paper , we study the sensitivity of the physically measurable quantities , branching ratio , photon energy distribution , to the new physics effects using the most general form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the effects of the new wilson coefficients @xmath14 on branching ratio and photon energy distribution is also investigated .",
    "the most general model independent form of the effective hamiltonian for the process @xmath15 can be written in the following form [ 4,5 ] ; @xmath16 where the projection operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 in eq.(1 ) are defined as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath14 are the coefficients of the four - fermi interactions . in this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves by considering only dirac neutrino in order to avoid additional lepton - number - violating operators .",
    "furthermore , the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 are well separated in the massless dirac neutrino case . however , for the massive neutrino case we can change chirality with help of the mass , and therefore in this case it is necessary the right - handed neutrino to be heavy . in general , the wilson coeeficients for @xmath23 and @xmath24 processes are different",
    ". however , operator structures in both case must be the same , since for massive neutrino case charged lepton and neutrino except their electric charge are the same with respect to the su(2 ) .",
    "first four terms in the effective hamiltonian are the vector interactions .",
    "the interaction terms with coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 which are present in the sm are given in the form , @xmath27 the contributions from the new physics can be described by redefining the wilson coefficients as @xmath28 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 describe the scalar type interactions which disappear in our calculations for @xmath31 process .",
    "the remaining last two coefficients in eq.(1 ) , correspond to tensor type interactions . in general",
    ", these operators are possible and they can appear from the exchange of spin-2 particles .",
    "it is obvious that the effects of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 operators will be larger , because there are more lorentz indices , which means that summing over them will lead to larger effects . in order to calculate the matrix element for @xmath34 decay we use the general form of the effective hamiltonian and the standard definitions for the matrix elements [ 6,7,8 ] ; @xmath35 \\,f(p^2)\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36\\ ] ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the polarization vector of the photon .",

    "the double differential decay width of the @xmath12 process in the rest frame of the @xmath3 meson can be written in the form @xmath46 the bounds of the final neutrino energy @xmath47 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath48 for photon energy are determined from the following inequalities @xmath49 in our calculations , we consider hard photon in the process @xmath12 . for the experimental observability of photon",
    "we impose a cut on the minimum energy to be greater than 25 mev which corresponds to @xmath50 [ 6,8,9 ] .",

    "we use the main input parameters @xmath55 in the numerical results . for the wilson",
    "coefficients we take the values @xmath56 and @xmath57 given in the [ 6,10 ] .    in this work",
    ", we assume that all new wilson coefficients @xmath14 are real and vary in the region @xmath58 @xmath59 . the experimental bounds on the branching ratios of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 [ 11 ] suggest that this is the right order of magnitude range for the vector and scalar interactions coefficients .",
    "therefore , we assume that all new wilson coefficients change in this range .",
    "the integrated branching ratio for the rare @xmath62 decay depending on the new wilson coefficients @xmath63 is plotted in fig .",
    "it is clear from this figure that branching ratio increases when all new wilson coefficients @xmath64 increase , for example , in the region @xmath58",
    "@xmath65 @xmath66 branching ratio decreases and it increases in the region @xmath67 @xmath32 @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , the branching ratio remain approximately unchanged when the coefficients @xmath69 varies and there is no sensitivity to these coefficients .",
    "the branching ratio weakly depends on the @xmath70 coefficients .",
    "however , one can conclude that the branching ratio is more sensitive to the tensor type @xmath32 and @xmath33 coefficients .",
    "we find the branching ratio @xmath72 for new wilson coefficients are set to zero .",
    "the branching ratio for the contact interactions give symmetrical distribution with respect to zero . measuring",
    "this branching ratio can give an information about the magnitude of this type tensor interactions , see fig .",
    "in addition , the @xmath73 and @xmath74 distribution can give an opportunity to detect the sign of these coefficients .",
    "we see that in dependence of the sign of the tensor interaction @xmath33 differential branching ratio can be larger or smaller than sm prediction .",
    "the photon energy distribution can also give information about new physics effects .",
    "in fig . [ fig3 ] , we present the differential branching ratio for the rare @xmath5 decay as a function of dimensionless variable @xmath48 for different values of coefficient @xmath74 . in this view",
    "the differential branching ratio measurement could give important information about the sign of new wilson coefficient .",
    "the higher sensitivity can be obtained when the photon energy reaches  @xmath76 .      in conclusion , using a general model independent effective hamiltonian for the process @xmath34 , the branching ratio and the photon energy distribution are found to be sensitive to the existence of new physics beyond the sm . within a reasonable range of branching ratios , it would be possible to detect the rare processes in the future b - factories . at planning lhc - b and b tev hadronic machines",
    "@xmath77 @xmath78 pair per years [ 12 ] will be produced .",
    "therefore , the number of expected events are @xmath79 , which quite detectable this decay in the above mentioned colliders .",
    "note that signature of this decay will be single photon and missing energy .",
