    "<S> a system that exhibits spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in the thermodynamic limit @xmath1 , where the order parameter does not commute with the hamiltonian , will for any finite system size have a unique ground state . </S>",

    "<S> anderson@xcite pointed out that such a finite size system contains a tower of states or thin spectrum@xcite : eigenstates with an energy @xmath2 that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , and who have a degeneracy structure that reveals the order parameter symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> recently , the notion that the ground state entanglement can reveal the low - energy spectrum of a phase has gained widespread recognition.@xcite for ssb - systems , this suggests that information about the symmetry breaking lies hidden in the completely symmetric ground state . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it has been shown numerically for the collinear antiferromagnet that the entanglement entropy does exhibit the tower of states by having an extra logarithmic term.@xcite these results were confirmed analytically using the non - linear sigma model.@xcite    in this paper we extend the analytical results of ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ ] to explain the numerical results@xcite for the entanglement structure of _ coplanar antiferromagnets _ on the triangular and kagom lattice . unlike collinear antiferromagnets , the order parameter now has an @xmath0 symmetry , which changes the degeneracies of the tower of states . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ secafm ] we will introduce the concept of @xmath0 order , and the corresponding tower of states . </S>",

    "<S> [ secentg ] that , consistent with the numerical results , the tower of states will also be present in the entanglement spectrum of the ground state . </S>",
