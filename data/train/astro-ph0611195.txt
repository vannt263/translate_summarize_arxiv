    "the work presented in this paper differs from other investigations in two important aspects .",
    "firstly , our model incorporates detailed calculations of the igm transmission @xcite . for a description of these calculations the reader",
    "is referred to that paper . here , we briefly summarise the models main ingredients .",
    "the igm transmission is calculated using a model for the gas in the igm that accounts for clumping , and infall . in this model ,",
    "resonant absorption of ly@xmath0 photons by gas in the infall region ( which extends out to several virial radii ) erases a significant fraction of the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "the model also accounts for damping wing absorption in cases in which a ( partially ) neutral igm surrounds the hii bubble .",
    "secondly , we perform statistical comparisons to the most up - to date observations .    in   [ sec : model ]",
    "we present our model of the ly@xmath0 lf . in   [ sec : data ] we describe the data available .",
    "the results of our comparison with the data and conclusions are presented in   [ sec : result ] and   [ sec : conclusion ] , respectively .",
    "the parameters for the background cosmology used throughout this paper are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we use the following simple prescription to relate the ly@xmath0 luminosity of a galaxy to the mass of its host dark matter @xmath20 .",
    "the total mass of baryons within a galaxy is @xmath21 , of which a fraction @xmath22 is assumed to be converted into stars over a time scale of @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath24 is the duty cycle and @xmath25 , is the hubble time at redshift @xmath26 .",
    "this prescription yields a star formation rate of @xmath27 . the star formation rate can be converted into a ly@xmath0 luminosity by assuming that approximately two - thirds of the ionising photons absorbed within the galaxy are converted into ly@xmath0 @xcite , thus @xmath28 . here , @xmath29 is the escape fraction of ionising photons , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ev is the energy of a ly@xmath0 photon .",
    "the total output of ionising photons per unit mass of star formation , @xmath32 , depends on the metallicity of the gas from which stars formed , as well as their initial mass function @xcite . in the reminder of this paper ,",
    "we assume a salpeter imf and @xmath33 .",
    "luminosity and @xmath34 is large , as it depends on an unknown imf and metallicity of the gas from which the galaxies formed @xcite . for the present work , because of the degeneracy between @xmath22 and the prefactor in eq  2 .",
    ", the exact relation ( and therefore the assumed metallicity ) is not important . ]",
    "the number density of ly@xmath0 emitters with ly@xmath0 luminosities exceeding @xmath35 is then given by @xmath36where the ly@xmath0 luminosity and host halo mass , @xmath37 are related luminosity - in a galaxy is related to the total amount of gas available , and thus to @xmath20 , no direct observational evidence exists to support this assumption .",
    "the fact that we obtain good fits to the data for reasonable model parameters (   [ sec : result ] ) is promising , and suggests that our model provides a reasonable description .",
    "however , even if one dismisses the assumption that ly@xmath0 luminosity relates to halo mass , then it is still possible to obtain constraints on the change of the igm transmission with redshift using the rest - frame uv - lf of laes ( as is discussed in   [ sec : uv ] ) .",
    "] by @xmath38 in this relation , @xmath39 is the igm transmission multiplied by the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons from the galaxy .",
    "the function @xmath40 is the press - schechter ( 1974 ) mass function ( with the modification of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gives the number density of halos of mass @xmath41 ( in units of comoving mpc@xmath42 ) .",
    "according to this prescription , the ly@xmath0 lf has two free parameters @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we explicitly assume that @xmath44 is independent of @xmath37 and @xmath34 . in @xcite , we found @xmath44 to decrease with increasing @xmath37 ( because infall is more prominent around higher mass halos ) and increasing @xmath34 ( because a larger output of ionising photons reduces the impact of resonant absorption in the infall region ) .",
    "conversely , for a fixed @xmath24 , increasing @xmath37 results in an increase of @xmath34 , and hence an increase in @xmath39 . given that the range of observed luminosities , and hence halo masses , spans only @xmath45 dex (   [ sec : data ] ) , the variation in @xmath39 with @xmath37 and @xmath34 can be ignored . in this paper",
    "we compare models for the ly@xmath0 lf to observation as a function of these parameters and constrain the evolution in @xmath46 between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "detailed ly@xmath0 lfs have recently been presented by shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for laes observed at @xmath1 , and by taniguchi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and kashikawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , for laes observed at @xmath2 . some caution must be exercised when comparing our models to this data .",
    "first , the observed luminosities have been derived from the observed fluxes by assuming that all ly@xmath0 emerging from the galaxy was transmitted by the igm . however , this is very unlikely .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that under reasonable model assumptions , the igm transmits only a fraction of @xmath47 @xcite of ly@xmath0 photons , even when highly ionised .",
    "we therefore replace the quoted observed luminosities , @xmath48 by @xmath49(as in eq  [ eq : form ] and eq  [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "second , the error bars on the data are uncertain .",
    "for example , the _ open circles _ shown in our figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] and figure  5 of @xcite denote the lf derived from the raw counts of their spectroscopic sample+additional photometric sample .",
    "the _ filled circles _ are corrected for detection incompleteness .",
    "the error - bars on the _ filled circles _ denote poisson - errors . additionally , cosmic variance is expected to add a variance of @xmath50 at the lowest ( highest ) luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and enters as an overall shift of the ly@xmath0 lf in the vertical direction . as a result ,",
    "cosmic variance could be ( partly ) responsible for the off - set in the lfs between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the first part of our analysis we consider the ly@xmath0 lf alone , and",
    "ignore cosmic variance .",
    "allowing for cosmic variance would enlarge the errobars on model parameters and strengthen the conclusion that the evolution of the ly@xmath0 lf alone , can be fully accounted for by the evolution of the mass function of dark matter halos . in the second part",
    ", we remove the effect of cosmic variance by considering the joint evolution of the ly@xmath0 and uv - lfs .    furthermore , the lower luminosity points ( @xmath51 erg s@xmath52 ) suffer more from detection incompleteness , as evidenced by the larger offset between the corrected and uncorrected data points .",
    "in addition , the igm is expected to transmit only 10 - 40% of the ly@xmath0 flux for these galaxies , and the detection of these low luminosity ly@xmath0 emitters requires an unusually large igm transmission ( @xmath53 , or unusually large ly@xmath0 luminosity * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it follows then that these galaxies must comprise only a ( small ) subset of the true sample .",
    "however , the exact uncertainty this introduces is not known .",
    "we account for this uncertainty by enlarging the adopted error - bars at @xmath51 erg s@xmath52 by factors of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the lowest and second lowest luminosity point , respectively ( on the _ filled circles _ ) .",
    "these enlargements were chosen so that the @xmath56 error bars enclose the data points prior to the adjustment .",
    "the choice of error bars on these low luminosity points affects the values of our best fit model parameters , but not our conclusions regarding evolution in transmission of the igm .",
    "we calculated the ly@xmath0 lf for a grid of models in the @xmath43-plane , and generated likelihoods @xmath57={\\rm exp}[-0.5\\chi^2]$ ] , where @xmath58 , for each model . here ,",
    "data@xmath59 and @xmath60 are the i@xmath61 data point and its error , and model@xmath59 is the model evaluated at the @xmath62 luminosity bin . the sum is over @xmath63 points .",
    "luminosities exceeding @xmath48 .",
    "the data points are therefore not completely independent . however , the number of galaxies more than doubles between most bins , and the errorbars do not overlap .",
    "this indicates that although cumulative , the points are close to independent . ]",
    "likelihoods were determined for each redshift independently . in the _ left panel _ of figure",
    "[ fig : p ] we show likelihood contours in the @xmath43-plane at @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the peak likelihood at @xmath1 ( as _ dashed _ contours ) and @xmath2 ( overlaid as _ solid _",
    "contours ) .",
    "the likelihood contours at both redshifts fill the same region of the @xmath43-plane .",
    "the likelihoods peak at @xmath67 at @xmath1 and at @xmath68 at @xmath2 , with a strong degeneracy between @xmath24 and @xmath46 .",
    "this degeneracy arises because a lower duty cycle corresponds to a lower @xmath69 , which requires a lower @xmath70 to achieve the same star formation rate for a fixed value of @xmath20 . and",
    "@xmath46 by the same factor yields the same ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "however , because the galaxies are visible for a shorter time , this still results in the prediction of fewer objects .",
    "this causes the deviation from a 45-degree degeneracy - line in the @xmath43-plane : changing @xmath24 by 1 order of magnitude is compensated for by changing @xmath46 only by half an order of magnitude . ]    in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] we show the best fit models at @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , the models provide an adequate fit to the data .",
    "we also show the model @xmath71 lf ( _ black dot - dashed line _ ) , under the assumption that only the halo mass function evolved between @xmath2 and @xmath71 . the _ triangle _ represents the density implied by the @xmath71 galaxy discovered by @xcite .",
    "this density is consistent with the model lf at the @xmath56 level , suggesting that no drastic change in the igm transmission is required between @xmath2 and @xmath71 .    at @xmath1 the duty cycle",
    "was found to lie in the range @xmath72 $ ] , while at @xmath2 this range was @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "the likelihood in @xmath24 therefore extends over more than 1 dex in each case . as a result",
    ", the a - posteriori probability for @xmath24 is quite sensitive to the choice of a prior probability .",
    "thus the data do not really constrain the duty cycle . therefore , in the _ right panel _ of figure  [ fig : p ] , we show slices through the likelihood surface at @xmath74 and at @xmath75 respectively , normalised to a peak of unity . the distribution of @xmath46 at @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are shown as the _ black solid _ and _ red dotted lines_. for fixed @xmath24 , the most likely values of @xmath46 are common at both redshifts . assuming that @xmath22 does not evolve between @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", it therefore follows that the igm transmission need not evolve significantly between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in order to explain the evolution of the lf .",
    "thus the evolution in the observed lf may be attributed to the mass function of dark matter halos alone .",
    "this is explored in more detail in   [ sec : evo ] .",
    "note that the best fit values for @xmath76 $ ] meet our prior expectations .",
    "for @xmath77 , we find @xmath78 , which corresponds to the range of transmissions found in @xcite . in our best - fit models ,",
    "the mass range of ly@xmath0 emitters is @xmath79 at @xmath1 and @xmath80 at @xmath2 .      in this section",
    "we investigate the evolution of the igm transmission , @xmath39 in more detail .",
    "we found that the observed lfs can be described by models over a large range in duty cycle @xmath24 .",
    "here , we fix the duty cycle and @xmath22 to be common between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and vary the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the igm transmission at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we compute model lfs on a grid in the @xmath85-plane and simultaneously fit to the observed lfs at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in figure  [ fig : rattrans ] . here",
    ", likelihood contours at @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the peak likelihood are plotted in the @xmath85-plane for 3 different duty cycles ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) . the likelihood - curves shift towards higher @xmath81 for larger values of @xmath24 due to",
    "the degeneracy noted above .",
    "this figure shows that the ratio @xmath82 is close to @xmath88 ( within @xmath89 ) for all reasonable values of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the observed evolution in the ly@xmath0 lf can be attributed to the evolution of the mass function of dark matter halos .      in the previous section we derived constraints on the ratio @xmath90 using a simple model for the ly@xmath0 lf in which the star formation rate in a galaxy increases in proportion to @xmath20 , the total mass of its host dark matter halo .",
    "we showed that the observed evolution in the ly@xmath0 lf can be attributed to the evolution of the mass function of dark matter halos .",
    "as evidenced by figure  [ fig : rattrans ] , our exact constraints are somewhat dependent on the unknown model parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the goal of this section is to obtain constraints on @xmath39 that are independent of any of our model parameters , and more generally , to obtain constraints that are independent of the model that underlies the ly@xmath0 lf .",
    "@xcite found that the rest - frame uv - lf of laes does not evolve between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this appears to contradict the conclusion that the evolution of dark matter halos ( possibly in combination with cosmic variance ) caused the observed evolution of the ly@xmath0 lf .",
    "indeed , if the rest - frame uv - lf of laes is identical at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then the entire difference between the ly@xmath0 lfs at @xmath1 and @xmath2 must be due to a change in either @xmath39 or in the ratio @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 is rest - frame uv luminosity of a galaxy ) .",
    "in other words , a lower igm transmission ( or @xmath91 ratio ) at @xmath2 would shift the ly@xmath0 luminosity function to the left relative to the @xmath1 ly@xmath0 lf .",
    "assuming for the moment that @xmath91 remains constant , we quantify the ratio @xmath93 that is favored by this constraint .",
    "while the analysis could be done for individual galaxies , we consider the sample as a whole , by taking the model parameters @xmath94 of our best - fit @xmath1 model .",
    "we then obtain @xmath2 ly@xmath0 lfs for a range of @xmath84 by scaling the luminosities in the @xmath1 model by a factor of @xmath90 . in figure",
    "[ fig : uv ] we plot the likelihood , @xmath57={\\rm exp}[-0.5\\chi^2]$ ] , as function of the ratio @xmath90 .",
    "if the uv - lf remained constant between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then we find @xmath95 ( @xmath96 cl ) .",
    "the preferred ratio decreases if the uv - lf at @xmath2 lies below that at @xmath1 .",
    "existing data is inconclusive regarding the precise evolution of the uv - lf between @xmath1 and @xmath2 : from the size of the error - bars in figure  7 of @xcite , we find that the best - fit @xmath2 uv - lf to lie higher by a factor of @xmath97 ( 95% ) than at @xmath1 if all data points brighter than @xmath98 are used , while it lies higher by a factor of @xmath99 ( 95% ) if the two data points at @xmath100 are ignored .",
    "figure  [ fig : uv ] shows the the likelihood of the ratio @xmath90 assuming that the @xmath2 lf lies higher by a factor of @xmath101 ( 1.2 ) as the _ dotted ( dashed ) line_. assuming for simplicity that the ratio of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 uv - lfs has a flat likelihood distribution between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then it follows from figure  [ fig : uv ] that @xmath103 ( @xmath104 cl ) .",
    "we quantify in more detail below how this compares to the evolution of the transmission in a fully (   [ sec : ratio ] ) and partially (   [ sec : bub ] ) reionised universe .",
    "the relative normalisations of the uv & ly@xmath0 lfs may evolve for reasons other than transmission .",
    "either ( 1 ) @xmath92 increases with redshift , or ( 2 ) @xmath105 decreases with redshift .",
    "( 1 ) could be caused by decreasing dust abundance towards higher redshift .",
    "however , the observed ly@xmath0 lf requires that ly@xmath0 is affected less by this possible evolution of the dust content , which in turn requires fine tuning of how the dust is distributed .",

    "in fact , it is possible to attribute the observed evolution in the ly@xmath0 lf entirely to the evolution in the mass function of dark matter halos .",
    "the presence of cosmic variance in the observations strengthens this conclusion .    however , the observed rest - frame uv - lf of ly@xmath0 emitters appears not evolve between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "accounting for the co - evolution implies that the observed evolution of the ly@xmath0 lf may indeed be due to the evolution of the igm transmission between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we find in this case that the ratio of transmissions is @xmath142 ( @xmath143 confidence levels ) .",
    "this result is insensitive to the underlying model of the ly@xmath0 lf ( as well as cosmic variance ) .",
    "however , we find that the ratio of transmissions expected for a fully reionised igm out to @xmath129 can be as large as @xmath5 .",
    "thus as with consideration of the ly@xmath0 lfs alone , the observed evolution is consistent with no change in the ionisation state of the igm .",
    "the existing lfs therefore do not provide evidence for overlap between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the upper limit @xmath127 implies that the universe at @xmath2 was more than half ionised by volume , i.e. @xmath7 .    the present paper is based on observed lfs that were derived from spectroscopic observations of @xmath144 @xmath2 and @xmath145 @xmath1 ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "a larger sample of ly@xmath0 emitters at both redshifts will allow more stringent constraints to be placed on simple models such as those presented here . in particular , the existing lf covers 1 dex in luminosity only .",
    "a larger range in luminosities will be useful for _ ( i ) _ breaking model degeneracies and determining the duty cycle and _ ( ii ) _ determining the evolution of the igm transmission @xmath39 to greater accuracy , especially when ly@xmath0 lfs are used in combination with the uv - lf of ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "this will provide constraints on the epoch of reionization which are independent of those derived from quasar absorption studies .",
    "an improved determination of the observed ly@xmath0 lf will also allow constraints to be placed on more sophisticated models , that account for the impact of the interstellar medium on the ly@xmath0 emission from galaxies ( as in * ? ? ? * ) , include galaxy clustering and account for scatter in quantities such as @xmath46 , @xmath24 etc .",
    "these issues will be addressed in future work .    *",
