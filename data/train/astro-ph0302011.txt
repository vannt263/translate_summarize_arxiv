    "the detection of wind profiles in the @xmath21032 , 1038 resonance doublet in _ copernicus _ spectra of stars with spectral types between o4 and b1 @xcite provided the first evidence for the existence of high - energy , non - radiative processes in the outflows from hot stars .",
    "the presence of this ion was surprising , since only the hottest o stars are expected to produce it directly through photoionization . in a pivotal paper , @xcite demonstrated that x - rays can produce sufficient by auger ionization of , which is the dominant ionization stage of oxygen in the winds of stars in the temperature range where is observed . the x - ray flux required by the auger mechanism",
    "was subsequently detected in spectra of ob - type stars obtained by the _",
    "observatory @xcite .",
    "since the existence of is linked directly to the presence of x - rays , the shape and strength of the lines can be used to trace the distribution of hot , x - ray emitting gas in the winds of early - type stars @xcite .",
    "x - rays are believed to be caused by the formation of strong shocks in the wind , which convert mechanical energy of the flow into localized sources of heat .",
    "these shocks could arise from various processes , such as : ( a ) the `` line de - shadowing instability '' intrinsic to the line - driving mechanism responsible for hot - star winds @xcite ; ( b ) the interfaces of large - scale co - rotating interactions regions ( cirs ) , which might be responsible for recurrent variability in hot - star winds @xcite ; or ( c ) collisions ( channeling ) of material along closed ( open ) magnetic fields emanating from the surface of the star @xcite .",
    "since these mechanisms involve the evolution of complicated , non - stationary flows , their tracers might be expected to exhibit substantial variations .",
    "for example , if the bulk of the x - rays or ions are produced by a few strong shocks ( as in the case of cirs and simple magnetic field configurations ) , large variations might be expected as the distribution or strength of the shocks evolves .",
    "conversely , little or no variability would be expected if the global distribution of the shocks ( e.g. , resulting from many ensembles of shocks generated by the line - deshadowing instability ) do not change much with time . in either case ,",
    "fluctuations in the tracers of the high energy processes provide information about the origin and distribution of the hottest gas in these outflows .    until recently ,",
    "x - rays were the predominant tracers of shock phenomena in the winds of hot stars .",
    "the limited x - ray data available suggest little short - term variability , which is generally interpreted as implying that many shock ensembles are present in the wind ( see ,  e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the evolution of any one of them is of little consequence . however , a variety of selection effects might also bias this interpretation ; see , e.g. , @xcite . at a fundamental level , spatially localized variations in the x - ray flux",
    "may be difficult to detect against the background contributions collected from nearly the entire volume of the wind .",
    "this situation changed dramatically with the launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _",
    "satellite , which provides routine access to the resonance lines of . observations of these wind features permit more sensitive searches for variability , primarily because they are formed by the resonant scattering of photons in localized regions of the wind ( i.e. , the column of material projected against the disk of the star ) .",
    "such observations also permit wind features to be identified , even though they are otherwise difficult to detect because of blends with strong stellar and interstellar lines . moreover , the _ fuse _ spectrographs are themselves very sensitive , so that ob - type stars in the magellanic clouds are easily accessible .    in order to exploit this new capability",
    ", we designed several principal investigator ( pi ) team programs to obtain sparse time series observations for a large sample of ob - type stars in the milky way and magellanic clouds .",
    "these time series were obtained by breaking long integrations into two or three observations separated by intervals that typically amounted to a few days .",
    "although these time series provide the bare minimum of information required to detect variations , they permitted a broad range of stellar parameters to be surveyed .",
    "the aim was to provide a rudimentary assessment of the frequency of variability as a function of spectral type and luminosity class ; to determine whether was as variable as the stellar wind features in and ; and to glean whatever information possible about the nature of the variations .",
    "although this approach is statistical in nature , it complements other studies undertaken with _ fuse _ designed to characterize stellar wind variability in and other far ultraviolet wind lines for specific targets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it also provides the information required to assess the effect of stellar wind variability on measurements of the interstellar lines ( see ,  e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in tables  [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] , we summarize the milky way ( mw ) and magellanic clouds ( mc ) observations , respectively",
    ". basic properties ( galactic coordinates , spectral - type , magnitude and reddening , terminal and projected rotational velocities ) are indicated .",
    "columns 7 and 8 show the separation in days between two successive observations and the dates when they were taken , respectively .",
    "most of these sparse time series consist of 23 observations separated by intervals ranging from a few days to several months .",
    "the ninth column identifies the rootname of the _ fuse _ data set , and is followed by remarks concerning the presence of radial velocity variations in the object .",
    "the time - series observations were obtained mainly through two large programs conducted by the _ fuse _ pi team , namely the  ism \" ( p101 , p102 , p122 ) and  hot stars \" ( p117 ) working group investigations .",
    "the purposes of these multiple observations were to investigate the time - variability in the winds of early - type stars from a stellar point of view ( this paper ) and to assess its impact on the interstellar absorption measurements of @xcite .",
    "other ( non - proprietary ) data from guest investigator programs were also included ( observation rootnames starting with a and b ) , as were targets obtained as early - release observations ( rootnames starting with x ) .",
    "table  [ t1 ] indicates that the mw sample is strongly biased toward later type stars ( o9-b0-b0.5 ) , while the mc sample ( table  [ t2 ] ) is slightly more uniformly distributed but of smaller size .",
    "these selection effects limit the conclusions that can be drawn : the sample is biased in spectral type ; it is not large enough for a meaningful statistical analysis to be performed for each spectral and luminosity class ; and the number of multiple observations is very small .",
    "it is nonetheless the largest sample available to study variability in the winds of early - type stars .",
    "a total of 66 stars ( 44 galactic stars , 20 lmc stars , and 2 smc stars ) were observed with typically 2 or 3 observations , except for a few cases with 4 exposures .",
    "a future complementary study will involve the analysis of the high time - resolution observations of two lmc stars @xcite .",
    "_ fuse _ consists of four co - aligned telescopes and spectrographs , termed `` channels '' , two of which have sic coatings to maximize the sensitivity in the wavelength range @xmath39051105  , while the other two have al - lif coatings for sensitivity in the @xmath310001187   range .",
    "this wavelength region provides access to a rich suite of resonance and excited lines , in particular for the ions considered here : , , and .",
    "the channels are referred to as sic1 and sic2 and lif1 and lif2 , respectively .",
    "this design includes overlap at certain wavelengths , which helps to distinguish between real features in the spectra and instrumental artifacts , particularly fixed - pattern noise .",
    "since we are interested in time - variability in the spectra , this redundant coverage is essential to make sure the differences are in the spectrum of the source and not due to detector defects .",
    "more complete descriptions of the design and performance of the _ fuse _ spectrographs are given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "most of the observations were obtained through the @xmath4 ( lwrs ) apertures , except for a few cases where they were obtained through the @xmath5 ( mdrs ) and @xmath6 ( hirs ) apertures .",
    "since flux can be lost through the narrower apertures , systematic multiplicative corrections were applied to adjust the flux levels to a common value .",
    "these corrections do not affect the detection of variations .",
    "in a few cases , however , and especially for lif1b or lif2a ( which contain the lines ) , the adjustments are compromised by contamination from the `` worm , '' a feature that deforms the continuum non - linearly .",
    "the worm is understood to be due to shadowing from grid wires in front of the detector @xcite .",
    "standard processing with version 2.0.5 of the calfuse calibration pipeline software was used to extract and calibrate the spectra .",
    "the software screened the data for valid photon events , removed burst events , corrected for geometrical distortions , spectral motions , satellite orbital motions , and detector background , and finally applied flux and wavelength calibrations .",
    "the extracted spectra associated with the separate exposures of a given observation were aligned by cross - correlating the positions of strong interstellar lines , co - added , and rebinned to a spectral resolving power of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 @xmath0 ) .      to compare to wind variability in , we chose to examine the lines of and based on two main criteria : ( i ) they are present over a wide range of spectral types ( i.e. , and are dominant ionization stages or near dominant ionization stages , see below ) .",
    "( ii ) the lines fall in sections of the spectrum where they are minimally contaminated by blending with interstellar features . at wavelengths below 1000  ,",
    "the signal - to - noise level becomes significantly weaker because the effective areas of the sic channels are smaller .",
    "below , we briefly recall some properties of the ions under consideration and their behavior through the h - r diagram of ob - type stars .",
    "this is mostly based on the two recent _ fuse _ atlases of ob - type stars in the mw @xcite and the mc @xcite    owing to the high ionization required to form ( i.p .",
    ": 113.9138.1 ev ) , the @xmath9@xmath91031.926 , 1037.617 resonance doublet is the most useful tracer of high - energy processes in the optical / uv region of the spectrum .",
    "its prevalence is believed to be directly related to the distribution of x - rays in the winds of the hot stars . in this sense , is often referred to as a `` super - ion '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other super - ions exist in fuv spectra ( e.g. , and ) , but remains unique because it is two stages above the dominant ionization stage of . because of this , auger ionization of is believed to be the dominant process for producing @xcite .    throughout the early o - type dwarf stars and from o2 to b0 supergiants , the lines exhibit typical p cygni profiles @xcite , which consist of an extended blue - shifted absorption trough and red - shifted emission peak . because the separation between the lines is only 1650 @xmath0 , the absorption trough of @xmath91038 is often blended with the emission part of @xmath91032 .",
    "similarly , the absorption trough of @xmath91032 can be lost in the saturated absorption line of ly@xmath10 . moreover , several other interstellar absorption lines ( , , and h@xmath11 ) can complicate the appearance of stellar line profiles .",
    "we discuss the different contaminations of the wind profiles in more detail in section  [ tv ] .",
    "one should refer to the normalized spectra in the mc _ fuse _ atlas of ob - type stars @xcite , and to the unnormalized spectra of the mw _ fuse _ atlas of ob - type stars @xcite for illustrations of these spectra as a function of spectral type .",
    "@xmath9@xmath91117.977 , 1128.008 ( i.p . : 51.465.0 ev , similar to ) is a resonance doublet expected to be near the dominant ionization stage in the winds of o - type stars @xcite .",
    "it weakens substantially in spectra of b0 and later type stars , for which becomes the dominant ion .",
    "even though it is a dominant ion , it remains unsaturated because of its very low cosmic abundance ( @xmath12 = 5.57 $ ] compared to 8.87 for o and and 7.27 for s ) .",
    "this doublet has a luminosity dependence . in mid - o spectra",
    ", it appears mainly as photospheric absorption in dwarfs , a weak p cygni profiles in giants , and strong p cygni profiles in supergiants @xcite .",
    "@xmath9@xmath91062.664 , 1072.973 ( i.p .",
    ": 34.847.3 ev ) is one stage below the expected dominant ion stage of s in the winds of early o - type stars , but starts to dominate in late o and early b - type stars .",
    "@xmath91063 is a resonance line , while @xmath91073 arises from low - lying excited levels that produce two transitions at wavelengths 1072.973 and 1073.516  . since the transition at 1072.973 is",
    "about 9 times stronger than the transition at 1073.516  , we consider only the transition at 1072.973  .",
    "these transitions have a similar luminosity effect to the doublet for mid - o spectral types .",
    "however , in the spectra of early b - type stars , the lines are nearly independent of luminosity @xcite .",
    "we note that even though the ion fraction of both and could be substantially larger than the ion fraction of , their low abundance ( 0.05% and 2.5% as abundant as o , respectively ) could make their detection difficult , especially in the mc where the metallicity is down by about @xmath13% compared to the mw .",
    "several careful steps were taken to uncover time - dependent changes in the profiles of these sparse time series observations : + ( i ) for each species , we first transformed the spectra from wavelength space to velocity space in order to facilitate direct comparisons between the components of the doublet and lines from different species .",
    "this velocity is in the heliocentric frame , but , unfortunately , the velocity zero point in _ fuse _ spectra remains uncertain by several tens of @xmath0 .",
    "the relative velocity can be accurate to a few @xmath0   within one channel , but can vary by more than 10 @xmath0  between channels . using the velocity scale , we compared both the calibrated fluxes and the ratio of the fluxes .",
    "+ ( ii ) the blue component of the doublet is affected by the airglow emission and the interstellar absorption of ly@xmath10 , which lies 1805 @xmath0  blueward of @xmath91032 . in tables",
    "[ t1 ] and [ t2 ] , we give the terminal velocity , @xmath14 , which should give roughly the extent of the wind profiles . is implied . ]",
    "when @xmath14 is greater than 1805 @xmath0 , the blue component of the doublet is completely absorbed by the interstellar ly@xmath10 line .",
    "therefore , the @xmath91038 component was first checked for possible variations .",
    "if the ratio of the fluxes in the time series is a horizontal line , we conclude that the wind profiles were the same at the times when the observations occurred .",
    "note that for the red component of the doublet there is generally no information at velocities below 400500 @xmath0  because of blending with the saturated interstellar @xmath91036 line .",
    "+ ( iii ) if there were significant changes in the wind profiles between the different observations , we cross - checked that the profiles ( and the ratio of the fluxes ) were the same in the redundant spectra extracted from different channels of the observations . the @xmath9@xmath91032 , 1038 resonance doublet appears in lif1a , lif2b , sic1a , and sic2b spectra . because the mirrors and gratings move slightly and can be misaligned , information in one channel is occasionally lost , but usually there is more than one channel available .",
    "this step is especially important with _ fuse _ observations because the aging of detector components can introduce shifts and distortions in the spectral features ( known as the  walk \" ) that could mimic the variations we are looking for .",
    "however , this effect is larger near the edge of detector segments sic1a and sic2b and rather small near the center of detector segments lif1a and lif2b .",
    "the walk problem is also not expected to occur at the same position with the same amplitude in the different detector segments .",
    "thus , by carefully comparing the wind profiles from different segments , we can determine if the observed variation is intrinsic to the stellar wind .",
    "+ ( iv ) further information comes from the @xmath91032 transition when this line is not too contaminated by the ly@xmath10 airglow or absorption or airglow .",
    "we required that when @xmath91032 is available , it exhibits similar variations at the same velocities as the @xmath91038 component .",
    "if the wind profiles are unsaturated , we can also check that the line strength of @xmath91032 is approximately twice the value of @xmath91038 , as expected for optically thin absorption . since the velocity separation between the doublet is only 1650 @xmath0 , there are cases where the wind profiles can overlap . + ( v ) similar procedures applied for and , but because the doublet separations of these species are much larger than for ( 2900 and 2480 @xmath0 , respectively ) , there is generally no problem of overlapping wind profiles .",
    "there is also less blending with saturated interstellar lines .",
    "when strong h@xmath11 lines are present , they can contaminate @xmath91073 at velocities greater than 2000 @xmath0  and @xmath91063 at velocities less than 200 - 500 @xmath0 .",
    "for , there are generally no saturated interstellar lines , but possible blends with photospheric @xmath9@xmath91122.3 , 1124.9 and @xmath9@xmath91122.5 , 1128.3 can complicate the interpretation of these profiles .",
    "we note that the variations of @xmath91073 generally appear larger than for @xmath91063 , contrary to the expectation based on their rather similar oscillator strengths . a similar problem with the relative oscillator strengths of these transitions",
    "was noted by @xcite .",
    "these procedures ensured that the observed variations occur in the stellar wind profile , and also that weak variations could be detected in spectra characterized by signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows 3 examples from the galactic sample , for which we overplotted the spectra taken at two or three different times .",
    "the differences of these fluxes are also plotted for @xmath9@xmath91032 , 1038 , @xmath9@xmath91062 , 1073 , and @xmath9@xmath91118 , 1128 versus velocity . in the following figures , we instead plot @xmath15 $ ] as a function of @xmath16 , which has more physical meaning than a flux difference because it is related to the optical depth of a wind absorption .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows an example where no variation is detected .",
    "we note a slight change in the difference of the profiles around @xmath17 @xmath0 , probably near the terminal velocity of this star . however , no such change is observed in spectra from other segments , and we therefore rule out wind variability in this case .",
    "the right - hand panel shows a large amplitude variation that extends over a large fraction of all profiles .",
    "the middle panel shows a very small variation that extends over @xmath3500 @xmath0  only in the profile . in this case the redundant information provided by both components of the doublet permits small variations in comparatively noisy spectra to be detected unambiguously .",
    "note that in both the middle and right - hand panels , the effect of the worm can be observed in @xmath18 for velocities @xmath19 @xmath0 . yet by following the above procedure , we can distinguish between wind variability and instrumental artifacts .",
    "see also @xcite for other examples .",
    "wholesale shifts in the positions of photospheric lines indicate systematic motion of the star , possibly in a binary system .",
    "such motion produces a characteristic `` s '' shape in ratios or differences of spectra at a location that depends on the shift in radial velocity between the two spectra , and over a wavelength region that depends on the width of the photospheric line .",
    "we typically noted variations of this sort near the systemic velocity of the star , which indicates only small radial velocity variations .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] ( upper - left panel ) shows an example of such an `` s''-shape near the systemic velocity ( 0 @xmath0 ) in the profiles of and , which are largely photospheric .",
    "these variations are not seen in the line , which instead shows substantial variations between @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xmath0 ; i.e. , in the outflowing wind .",
    "an entry of `` rv var ''",
    "( rv var ? ) in the last column of tables  [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] indicates the presence ( suspected presence ) of photospheric radial velocity variations in the _ fuse _  time series .",
    "in figure  [ fig2 ] , the logarithm of the ratio of the fluxes observed at different times is presented as a function of the velocity for 4 examples in the mw and in the lmc , for @xmath21032 , 1038 , @xmath21062 , 1073 , and @xmath21118 , 1128 .",
    "based on analogous figures constructed for the whole sample , we summarize in table  [ t3 ] our assessment of whether the wind profiles for these ions were variable at the time of these observations .",
    "we also indicate the velocity range over which the variation is observed . in some cases",
    ", the high velocity value for was derived using the other species as there is overlap of the wind profiles at velocities larger than 1650 @xmath0 .",
    "for some cases  particularly in the mc sample  no information is given concerning the velocity extent of the wind variations due to uncertainties resulting from the lower signal - to - noise of the data and the greater degree of contamination by and airglow emission lines .",
    "( n ) \" in table  [ t3 ] indicates that the spectra suffer either from low signal - to - noise level or some problem in the fluxes , or that the wind is contaminated by other stellar lines ( in the case of radial velocity variables , and particularly for the lines ) .",
    "thus when ",
    "( n ) \" is listed , detections of variability are more uncertain .",
    "several inferences can be drawn from these measurements :    \\(1 ) for the whole sample , 56% of the wind profiles vary with time . for the mw @xmath22 ( 55% ) and @xmath23 ( 59% ) for the mc",
    "show variability .",
    "the frequency of wind variability is therefore similar in both samples .",
    "if we remove 8 stars with spectral type later than b1 for which is unlikely to be present @xcite , 64% of the combined sample is variable .",
    "in contrast , only 15% and 5% of the whole sample vary in the wind profiles of and .",
    "these latter percentages should be treated cautiously because the strengths of these ions vary with spectral type and luminosity class ( see   [ ions ] ) .",
    "they are expected to be strong in the winds of supergiants , and for those stars , the profiles are often variable ( see tables  [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] ) .",
    "\\(2 ) figure  [ fig3 ] shows the fraction of stars for which we observed wind changes as a function of spectral types and luminosity classes , where the error bars are @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the total number of stars in a given bin .",
    "the sample is not large enough to draw any definite conclusions , but suggests that the incidence of variability increases for earlier spectral types .",
    "this , however , could also be a selection effect caused by the stronger appearance of the p cygni profiles in the earlier - type stars .",
    "when all the spectral types are considered , all luminosity classes have a similar percentage of wind variability .",
    "however , if we take a more homogeneous sample and consider only spectral types between o9 and b0.5 , we find that the wind profiles vary in 7/10 ( 70% ) cases for supergiant stars ( luminosity class i ) , 8/12 ( 67% ) cases for giant stars ( luminosity class ii - iii ) , and 6/13 ( 46% ) cases for the dwarf stars ( luminosity class iv - v ) .",
    "the results are , however , not statistically significant at the @xmath26 level , and are insufficient to claim that wind variability occurs more frequently in supergiant and giant stars compared to dwarfs",

    "stars with such terminal velocities range from o3 to about o7-o8 @xcite",
    ". furthermore , these stars typically exhibit strongly saturated p  cygni profiles in the resonance lines , which makes the detection of localized absorption enhancements all the more difficult .",
    "a similar problem arises when @xmath57 @xmath0  because of the contamination of the wing of interstellar ly@xmath10 and absorption lines .",
    "stars with such terminal velocities typically have spectral types later than b0.5 @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) their shapes are usually not gaussian and can be asymmetric .",
    "\\(3 ) they appear with different strengths , and their full - widths at half maximum vary approximately from less than 100 @xmath0  up to 400500 @xmath0 , the latter generally being observed near @xmath1 ( see point 4 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) for the strong features , @xmath52 is similar to @xmath1 ( @xmath58 , except for sk@xmath536705 where @xmath59 ) , while for weak and medium features , @xmath52 is generally red - shifted by a few hundred @xmath0  with respect to @xmath1 ( @xmath60 ; except for sk@xmath5367101 where @xmath61 ) .",
    "\\(5 ) some features appear to vary on time scales of a day , but other features are at the same velocity after several days or months have passed .",
    "\\(6 ) the sparse time - series observations suggest that these features accelerate slowly with an acceleration of @xmath62 to less than @xmath3@xmath63 kms@xmath64 ( see figure  [ fig5 ] and figure  3 in lehner et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "\\(7 ) there is no direct relation between the widths of these features and the @xmath51 of star .",
    "neither their width nor strength correlates with luminosity class or spectral type .",
    "\\(8 ) there is no systematic difference in the frequency of occurence between the mw and mc sample , though the size of the sample is certainly not large enough to draw any definitive conclusions .",
    "we have described a survey for stellar wind variability based on sparse time - series observations of a large sample of stars observed with _",
    "fuse_. this survey demonstrates that the winds in ob - type stars are variable in the doublet on various scales both in time and velocity .",
    "the typical signatures of wind variability are observed via ( i ) variation in the profiles for 56% of the spectral types from o3 to b3 and 64% of the spectral types from o3 to b1 , and ( ii ) wind absorption features in 33% of the cases for the whole sample , or 46% of the cases for spectral types from o3 to b0.5 .",
    "these percentages have to be considered lower limits .",
    "owing to the nature of this survey , only a few exposures separated by a few days or a few months were obtained with no regard to the time scales believed to be relevant to the variability of hot - star winds .",
    "furthermore , the quality of _ fuse _  data precludes the detection of small - amplitude variations . in view of the high incidence of variability detected under these circumstances ,",
    "variability in wind profiles is likely ubiquitous .    at spectral types later than b1 , no wind variability is observed .",
    "this could be due to limitations in the detectability of wind activity caused by the weakness or absence of this feature in these stars , as well as the smaller number of stars observed in those spectral types . in the former case ,",
    "this might be explained by the fact that for later spectral types , becomes the dominant ion , so that can not be produced via auger ionization @xcite .",
    "the sample is not large enough to relate the frequency of the temporal variations or the absorption features to specific spectral types or luminosity classes .",
    "but it _ suggests _ that stars with spectral types earlier than o8 may show variations more often .",
    "the width over which the wind profile of the varies is poorly correlated with the terminal velocity for the mw sample .",
    "there is , however , a significant correlation ( close to a 1:1 relationship ) between the blue - edge velocity of the variation ( i.e. , at the maximum ( negative ) velocity at which no variation is observed ) and @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this might imply that systematically stronger shocks occur at larger velocities ( i.e. , near @xmath1 ) .",
    "although the high velocity absorption features seen in directly indicate the outflow of hot gas , it is not clear from this survey exactly how these absorption features evolve with time .",
    "figure  3 in @xcite and figure  [ fig5 ] give nice examples of velocity - varying absorption wind features , but more intensive time - series observations are required to characterize this evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we note , however , that the stronger ( both in optical depth and width ) components are near the terminal velocity , while weaker components appear and evolve at lower velocities .    by comparing the frequency of variability exhibited by to that seen in and , we found that only a small percentage of the whole sample shows wind variations for the lower ions , and those variations are mainly observed in supergiant stars .",
    "this may be largely due to two selection effects .",
    "one is that s and p are much less abundant than o , thereby making it more difficult to detect variations in these ions .",
    "the other is that our sample is biased toward late o - type and early b - type stars , where the wind becomes weaker for ;",
    "i.e. , the line becomes principally a photospheric line .",
    "the low frequency of observed variability in is harder to understand , because is expected to be the dominant ion in the winds of late o- and early b - type stars .",
    "if it is not merely an abundance selection effect , then this result may imply that the highly ionized component of these cooler winds is enhanced compared with hotter winds .",
    "suppose , e.g. , that the variability exhibited by a wind line is proportional to its optical depth ; i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "the ionization fraction is @xmath66 ( see , e.g. , massa et al .",
    "2002 ) , where @xmath67 is the abundance of the element . since variability is detected more frequently than variability , @xmath68@xmath69@xmath70 , i.e. @xmath71@xmath72@xmath70 , and @xmath73@xmath74@xmath70 .",
    "if is dominant , @xmath73@xmath75 , and hence @xmath73@xmath76 , which is at least an order of magnitude larger than typically observed for early- and mid - o type stars @xcite . this evidence for an excessive abundance of in the winds of comparatively cool stars  where it is least expected  is consistent with the predictions of @xcite , who concluded that the presence of x - rays can substantially alter the ionization balance of lower - density winds .",

    "<S> we have used the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ to conduct a snap - shot survey of variability in the winds of 66 ob - type stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> these time series consist of two or three observations separated by intervals ranging from a few days to several months . </S>",
    "<S> although these time series provide the bare minimum of information required to detect variations , this survey demonstrates that the doublet in the winds of ob - type stars is variable on various scales both in time and velocity . for spectral types from o3 to b1 , </S>",
    "<S> 64% vary in time . at spectral types later than b1 , no wind variability is observed . in view of the limitations of this survey , this fraction represents a lower limit on the true incidence of variability in the wind lines , which is very common and probably ubiquitous . in contrast , for and , only a small percentage of the whole sample shows wind variations , although this may be principally due to selection effects . </S>",
    "<S> the observed variations extend over several hundreds of @xmath0  of the wind profile and can be strong . </S>",
    "<S> the width over which the wind profile varies is only weakly correlated with the terminal velocity ( @xmath1 ) , but a significant correlation ( close to a 1:1 relationship ) is derived between the maximum velocity of the variation and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> high velocity wind absorption features ( possibly related to the discrete absorption components seen in other wind lines ) are also observed in 46% of the cases for spectral types from o3 to b0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> these features are variable , but the nature of their propagation can not be determined from this survey . if x - rays can produce sufficient by auger ionization of , and the x - rays originate from strong shocks in the wind , this study suggests that stronger shocks occur more frequently near @xmath1 , causing an enhancement of near @xmath1 . </S>"
