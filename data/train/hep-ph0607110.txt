    "unlike pseudoscalar , vector , and tensor mesons , the scalar mesons are not well known in terms of their @xmath13 classification , the particle content of their composition , or their spectroscopy .",
    "part of the problem is that there are too many experimental candidates for the @xmath4 nonet .",
    "[ scalar ] shows the current experimentally known scalar mesons whose number more than doubles that of a nonet .",
    "one viable solution is that low - lying scalars , such as the @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are tetraquark mesoniums whose classification and spectroscopy have been studied in the mit bag model  @xcite and the potential model  @xcite .",
    "another suggestion is that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 molecular states  @xcite .",
    "other candidates for tetraquark mesoniums include vector mesons pairs produced in @xmath17 reactions  @xcite and hadronic productions  @xcite and the recently discovered charmed narrow resonances  @xcite .    under the supposition that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are tetraquark mesoniums on account of the fact that they are favored by spectroscopy studies  @xcite , small two - photon decay widths  @xcite , and",
    "the pattern of @xmath18 and @xmath19 decays  @xcite , the question remains : where is the isovector scalar @xmath4 state ? from fig .",
    "[ scalar ] , we see that one candidate is @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the conventional wisdom of the quark model , its mass is too high .",
    "not only is it higher than @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in contrast to the spin - orbit splitting pattern in charmonium ; it is even slightly higher than @xmath22 which contains a strange quark and is believed to be the @xmath23 or @xmath24 meson in practically all the models  @xcite . according to the quark counting rule , mesons and baryons made up of strange quarks are expected to lie higher than their counterparts with @xmath25 quarks .",
    "notwithstanding the success of the quark potential model in describing charm and bottom hadrons , its applicability to light hadrons with @xmath26 symmetry has been questioned , since chiral symmetry plays an essential role  @xcite in light hadron dynamics .",
    "might it be that the scalar @xmath4 meson is yet another challenge to the @xmath26 quark model s delineation of light hadrons ?",
    "spectrum of scalar mesons together with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 mesons.,width=302 ]    lattice qcd is perhaps the most desirable tool to adjudicate the theoretical controversy surrounding the issue and to reveal the nature of the scalar mesons .",
    "in fact , there have been several calculations to study the @xmath0 meson with the @xmath30 interpolation field in the quenched approximation  @xcite and with dynamical fermions  @xcite . in calculations with relatively small quark masses",
    ", it is found that the @xmath0 mass does not change much below the strange quark mass .",
    "consequently , the chiral limit result is consistent with @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , it is emphasized that the would - be @xmath3 ghost states give negative contributions to the @xmath0 correlator in both the quenched case  @xcite and the partially quenched case  @xcite when the quark mass is lower than the strange .",
    "thus it is essential to take out these quenched or partially quenched artifacts before one can confidently obtain the @xmath0 mass . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "a calculation of the tetraquark mesonium with the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar 4-quark interpolation field  @xcite has been performed . from the deviation of the lowest state mass from that of the expected two - pion scattering state ,",
    "it was suggested  @xcite that a bound mesonium state is seen .    in the present work",
    ", we shall use the overlap fermion  @xcite to calculate @xmath0 and the scalar tetraquark mesonium .",
    "the overlap fermion has the benefit of having exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing .",
    "since chiral symmetry plays a pivotal role in these mesons in chiral effective theories ( in particular , it is concluded in the recent dispersion analysis of @xmath31 scattering that the occurrence of @xmath1 is on the basis of `` current algebra , spontaneous symmetry breakdown , and unitarity ''  @xcite ) , we believe it is desirable to adopt a fermion action which explicitly exhibits the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing .    for the study of @xmath0 , it is well known that there are @xmath3 ghost states in the quenched  @xcite and partially quenched  @xcite cases .",
    "these ghost states become the physical @xmath32 and @xmath3 states in the full dynamical calculation without partial quenching .",
    "such physical two meson states in full qcd have been seen when the quark masses are light enough  @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to obtain @xmath5 and possibly @xmath14 in the quenched approximation , one needs an algorithm which can fit multiple states including the @xmath3 ghost states which lie lower in mass than the @xmath33 scalar @xmath4 below the strange quark mass region .",
    "we have developed a sequential empirical bayes method ( sebm ) for constrained - curve fitting  @xcite to fit multiple states .",
    "this is based on the constrained - curve fitting of lattice data with bayesian priors  @xcite . in the sequential empirical bayes method  @xcite",
    ", one extracts the priors for the mass and spectral weight from a subset of data by fitting the two - point correlation function starting from the large time separation .",
    "first , one fits the ground state in a time window and then uses its fitted mass and spectral weight as priors to fit the first excited state in an extended time window .",
    "the process is repeated until time slices are exhausted .",
    "one then does a constrained - curve fit to the rest of the data set with the extracted priors .",
    "this method has been employed to fit the roper resonance , the radially excited nucleon , and @xmath34 on top of the @xmath35 ghost states  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used in extracting radially - excited states of 1p charmonium  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , for the range of quark masses that we fitted , the 3-volume dependence ( from a comparison of @xmath36 and @xmath37 lattices ) of the spectral weights of the respective ghost @xmath35 two - particle scattering state and the bound one - particle baryon state come out in agreement with expectation , as derived in ref .",
    "we regard this as a highly non - trivial test for the fitting method .",
    "similarly , in the study of the pentaquark state @xmath38 , we fitted the state in addition to the @xmath39 ghost state and found from the volume dependence that it is in agreement with the @xmath40 scattering state for a large range of quark masses  @xcite . through these studies , we are more confident that the fitting method is capable of fitting multiple states including the ghost states .",
    "it is of course limited by how good the data are and how many states one can fit , given the number of time slices of the lattice .",
    "we shall use this algorithm in the present study of @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "the smallest pion we have is 182(8 ) mev , which is substantially lower than most of the previous calculations of @xmath0 ; this allows us to study the behavior of @xmath0 with the pseudoscalar meson mass ranging from 1.3 gev down to 182 mev .",
    "this is important in revealing that the @xmath0 mass is very insensitive to quark mass in the range from strange quark down to the physical @xmath25 mass .",
    "this turns out to have significant phenomenological implications on the pattern of scalar mesons  @xcite . for the study of the @xmath31 mesonium with the tetraquark interpolation field on our lattice , it is crucial for the pion mass to be lower than @xmath41 mev in order to be able to disentangle the @xmath31 scattering states from the one - particle mesonium , in order to reveal the nature of the fitted states from the tetraquark correlator .",
    "thus , for both the case of @xmath42 and @xmath12 , it is essential to study them in the chiral regime where @xmath43 is smaller than @xmath44 mev .",
    "our calculation is based on data from @xmath36 and @xmath37 lattices with 300 quenched iwasaki gauge configurations ( @xmath45 ) and overlap fermions with a lattice spacing @xmath46 determined from @xmath47 .",
    "this makes our lattice sizes at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we will discuss the scale determination from the sommer scale @xmath50 later to assess the systematic error in scale setting .",
    "a subset of these quark propagators was used to study the quenched chiral logs in pion and nucleon masses  @xcite , the roper and @xmath51  @xcite , and the pentaquarks  @xcite",
    ".    there has been a concern that lattice spacing of @xmath52 fm may be too coarse for the overlap fermion and speculation that the range of the overlap dirac operator may be as long as 4 lattice units  @xcite .",
    "however , direct calculation  @xcite at lattice spacings of 0.2 , 0.17 , and 0.13 fm with iwasaki gauge action reveals that the range of the operator is comfortably small in each of these cases ( one lattice unit in euclidean distance and 2 units in `` taxi driver '' distance , the latter being defined as @xmath53 ) and it approaches zero toward the continuum limit .",
    "thus , we do nt think there is an issue regarding locality of the overlap operator at 0.2 fm that we base our results on .",

    "we first report results on @xmath0 for which we use @xmath30 as the interpolation field .",

    "it is seen that for pion mass lower than @xmath56 , the @xmath0 correlator starts to develop a negative tail , and it is progressively more negative at earlier time slices for smaller quark masses .",
    "this is a clear indication that at least one of the ghost @xmath3 states , being lightest in mass , are dominating the correlator over the physical @xmath0 at larger time slices .",
    "this has been reported in the literature for the quenched  @xcite and partially quenched  @xcite calculations and the ghost contribution has been removed with the help of re - summed hairpin diagrams .",
    "the ghost @xmath57 contribution in the @xmath0 correlator has been studied in the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop hairpin diagram gives the following contribution to the isovector scalar meson propagator @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the three - volume of the lattice , @xmath50 is the coupling between the scalar interpolation field and the @xmath60 and @xmath27  @xcite or the matrix element @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the hairpin insertion mass which is related to the topological susceptibility @xmath63 in the pure gauge theory .    the fourier transform ( ft ) of the dimensionless @xmath64 for the case of @xmath65 gives the following contribution to the scalar meson correlator on the euclidean lattice @xmath66 where @xmath67 and the @xmath68 factor is due to the double pole of the would - be @xmath60 ghost propagator in the loop . @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the number of lattice points in the spatial and time direction respectively .",

    "@xcite and the corresponding expression for the would - be @xmath71 one - loop contribution to the nucleon correlator is derived in the study of roper and @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "we shall use the expression @xmath72 where @xmath73 is referred to as the spectral weight in later discussion , to model the fit of each ghost state contribution . here",
    "we allow the energy , @xmath74 , of the interacting @xmath75 to be fitted to the data , but retain the double pole character of the prefactor @xmath76 .",
    "this should be a good approximation when the @xmath77 interaction is weak ( n.b . in the large @xmath78 consideration , the meson - meson interaction is of the order @xmath79 ) so that the prefactor due to the double pole in the would - be @xmath60 propagator remains largely valid when higher orders are included .",
    "we have used a similar expression to fit the @xmath35 ghost states in the nucleon and @xmath34 correlators  @xcite and found that their spectral weights have the correct 3-volume dependence for the range of quark masses we calculated .",

    "it is known that the scale in the quenched approximation is not determined uniquely .",
    "we note that if the sommer scale @xmath118 fm is used for the scale , the lattice spacing will be 12% smaller , i.e.  @xmath119 fm . as a result",

    "the same is true with the following calculation of the @xmath31 state and the tetraquark mesonium .",
    "since we do not see @xmath14 in the @xmath0 correlator with the @xmath30 interpolation field , it leaves room for it to be something other than a @xmath4 state , e.g.  a @xmath122 state as suggested in model studies .",
    "however , it is a challenge to verify it on the lattice due to the complication that there is a threshold @xmath16 state nearby ( within 10 mev ) .",
    "therefore , we shall study the @xmath12 first which , if present as a tetraquark mesonium , is several hundred mev above the @xmath31 threshold and several hundred mev below the next @xmath31 scattering state with momentum close to @xmath84 .",

    "resonance can be viewed as a mixture of a bound state and the scattering states in the usual potential model description of scattering and resonance . in a coupled channel approach",
    ", one can couple a bound state in the continuum with the scattering states via a coupling potential resulting in a bound state leaking to the continuum with a shift in mass and acquiring a width . on a hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the available momenta are @xmath131 and therefore the one- and two - meson spectra for a certain quantum number are discrete .",
    "imagine one considers a very large box where the two - meson spectrum has closely - spaced levels .",
    "when one looks at the spectral weights of the correlator in the channel with a specific quantum number , there will be envelopes of states with enhanced spectral weights which are the result of the mixture of a bound state and the nearby scattering states .",
    "they are the finite box representation of the resonances in the continuum .",
    "the `` width '' of the structure would reflect how far apart in energy the mixing takes place .",
    "if we start to decrease the size of the box , the spectrum is going to be less dense and states are further apart from each other . the number of states under the envelope diminishes . when the box is small enough",
    "so that the scattering states are spaced enough apart that none is expected to lie under the envelope , then only the bound state remains and thus can be identified as such . by being `` far enough apart ''",
    "we mean that we can define the separation of the scattering states @xmath132 to be several times greater than the width @xmath133 of the structure , i.e.  @xmath134 . in this case , the bound state and the scattering states are not mixed and they will each have a different volume dependence in their spectral weights . comparing the spectral weights of the same unmixed state in two lattice volumes",
    "is an effective way of revealing the one- or two - particle nature of the state  @xcite when the interpolation field projects to both the bound and scattering spectra in the correlator with a definite quantum number .",
    "this is our approach of identifying , through the volume study of their spectral weights , both a bound tetraquark state ( the @xmath1 ) and a two - pion scattering state which are reasonably well separated and unmixed .",
    "experimentally , @xmath1 is a very broad state with a width of @xmath135 mev according to the recent dispersion analysis  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask if it is ever possible to delineate it with a lattice calculation in euclidean space . to answer this , we shall reverse the above discussion on the existence of the bound state .",
    "suppose one finds a bound state in addition to the scattering states which are outside the `` width '' of the state at a relatively small volume .",
    "to gain information about the scattering phase shift and hence the real width , we now increase the box size . as the box size",
    "is increased , the energies of the scattering states will be lowered since the value of the discrete momenta decreases .",
    "when the scattering state above the bound state is lowered to within the range of the `` width '' , it mixes with the bound state ( this actually defines the range of the width ) and the two states avoid the level crossing . from the energy of the scattering",
    "state one can deduce the scattering phase shift using the lscher formula  @xcite .",
    "this is valid for elastic scattering irrespective of how broad the state is .",
    "this is studied in detail in a 2-d lattice model  @xcite and a spin model  @xcite which illustrate how the scattering state mixes with the bound state and gives rise to the phase shift as the volume is increased . in a sense , by varying the lattice volume , hence the momentum , one can use a scattering state to mix with the bound state and scan the spectrum to obtain the phase shift and therefore the width of the resonance .",
    "the information of the width can also be obtained by determining how far apart in energy the scattering and bound state start to avoid the level crossing .    in the present manuscript",
    ", we are only concerned about the existence of @xmath1 and will leave the study of its width to the future . in this vein",
    ", we have chosen the lattice size such that the two lowest @xmath31 scattering states are expected to be more than half of the experimental width , i.e.  @xmath136 mev , away from the expected @xmath1 mass at @xmath137 mev .",
    "if this expected result is borne out , we can use the volume test to discern the particle content of the states and thereby distinguish the bound @xmath1 from the two - pion scattering states .",
    "this is basically our strategy to seek the existence of @xmath1 .     for @xmath43 from 182 mev to 250 mev on the @xmath37 lattice .",
    "the solid lines indicate the energies of the two lowest non - interacting pions in s - wave with lattice momenta @xmath138 and @xmath139 . ]    to confirm the existence of @xmath12 beyond doubt , one needs to identify both the tetraquark mesonium and the collateral @xmath31 scattering states .",
    "secondly , one needs to work on a lattice where the scattering states and the bound state are well separated ( e.g.  further apart than half of the width of the `` would - be '' resonance ) to avoid admixture ; this is in order to discern the nature of these states separately to make sure that @xmath1 is indeed a one - particle state , not a two - particle scattering state .",
    "to this end , we used the adaptive bayes curve - fitting method  @xcite as described above to fit the ground state and the excited states of the tetraquark correlator with a local interpolation operator @xmath140 for both the source and the sink .",
    "we note that it does not matter what interpolation field one uses for the calculation , as long as it has overlap with the states of the corresponding quantum number .",
    "being local , the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar operator that we adopt will have vector - vector , scalar - scalar , @xmath141 components after fierz transform .",

    "the mass is around 600 mev .",
    "it is tantalizing to identify it with @xmath12 .",
    "to verify this , we study the volume dependence of the spectral weight of these states .",
    "it was advocated in the study of the roper resonance , the pentaquark , and the ghost state  @xcite that one efficient way of distinguishing a one - particle state from a two - particle scattering state in a finite box is to study the volume dependence of its spectral weight . from the normalization factor of @xmath178 for a particle in a box and the way the correlator",
    "is constructed , i.e.  with a point source and a zero - momentum sink , the spectral weight of a one - particle state does not explicitly depend on volume ; whereas , the spectral weight of a weakly interacting two - particle state has an explicit @xmath88 dependence  @xcite .",
    "this is true when the one particle state is reasonably separated from the scattering states so that the mixing of the two states is not strong enough to spoil the characteristic volume dependence of their respective spectral weights .",
    "since we have two lattices with sizes @xmath148 and @xmath36 , the spectral weight ratio for a two - particle state should be @xmath179 . plotted in fig .  [ ratio ] are the ratios of the spectral weights for the lowest state in fig .",
    "[ sigma_pipi ] and the first excited state around 600 mev .",
    "we see that the spectral weight ratio @xmath180 for the lowest state clusters around 2.37 , confirming our speculation that it is the interacting two pion state . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral weight ratio @xmath180 of the excited state near @xmath181 mev turns out to be consistent with unity .",
    "this suggests that this state is a one - particle state , not a @xmath31 scattering state , and strongly supports the identification of it to be the @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , by virtue of the fact that the ratios of spectral weights of these two low - lying states are consistent with unity and @xmath182 , it suggests that the mixing of the two states , if any , is small . in other words ,",
    "the two states with an energy separation of @xmath41 mev are reasonably well separated compared to half of the decay width of @xmath12 .",
    "extrapolated to the chiral limit , the mass of the one - particle state is @xmath183 mev .",
    "there have been concerns that the zero mode contributions which are finite volume effects may contaminate the results when the volume is small for the quark mass under study . in the case of the chiral condensate",
    ", the zero modes can be avoided by doubling the contribution from the chiral sector which does not have zero modes  @xcite . for the pion mass calculation ,",
    "the zero modes can be removed by considering the correlator of the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( pp ) and scalar - scalar ( ss ) combination @xmath184  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the zero mode contributions to the pion mass calculation on the same set of lattices used in the present study  @xcite by comparing the pion mass from the @xmath185 correlator and the @xmath184 correlator and found that there is no difference in the pion masses within errors .",
    "we concluded that the volume is large enough for this lattice that the zero mode contribution is less than the error for the range of quark mass studied . in the present study of @xmath186 and @xmath12",
    ", we do nt see any indication of mass divergence for small quark masses .",
    "we thus believe that the zero mode contributions are within errors in the connected insertions .    although lattice study of tetraquark states started some time ago  @xcite , we believe this is the first time that both the one - particle state and its concomitant scattering state are identified and their nature verified through the volume dependence of the spectral weights .",
    "short of such identification , we do nt think one is able to rigorously confirm the existence of the tetraquark mesonium .",
    "finally , we note that the calculation of tetraquark state with the @xmath187 interpolation field has first been attempted  @xcite .",
    "it was found that in the @xmath160 channel , the ground state is lower than the expected two interacting pion state from chiral perturbation theory and is interpreted as a bound state  a tetraquark mesonium . however , in this analysis the full qcd formula in eq .",
    "( [ full_qcd ] ) was employed which we pointed out earlier is not applicable to quenched calculations . if the quenched chiral perturbation calculation  @xcite , which has a different lattice length dependence , is used one might come to a different conclusion .",
    "to conclude , we calculated the isovector @xmath0 with the @xmath30 interpolation field and @xmath12 with the tetraquark interpolation field . with the overlap fermion ,",
    "we have come down in the chiral region with very low pion mass ( @xmath188 mev ) in the quenched approximation . after removing the fitted @xmath3 ghost states , we found the lowest @xmath0 at @xmath189 gev and @xmath190 at @xmath191 gev which are consistent with the experimental @xmath5 and @xmath22 being the @xmath4 states and confirms the earlier findings in quenched and partially quenched calculations at higher quark masses .",
    "in addition , we have been able to fit the @xmath192 scalar tetraquark correlator and have identified , through the volume study of their spectral weights , both the lowest interacting two - pion state and a one - particle state at @xmath193 mev .",
    "this suggests that @xmath12 does exist as a particle and it is a tetraquark mesonium .",
    "this is consistent with the recent dispersion relation analysis of @xmath31 and @xmath194 scattering with the roy equation which has led to the @xmath1 pole at @xmath195 mev with a width @xmath196 mev  @xcite .",
