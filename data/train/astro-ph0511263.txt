    "since the end of 60 s , models based on the maxwellian phase - space distribution function ( df ) have been extensively used in the so called _ parametric _ fit of globular clusters light profiles , in order to infer important properties like the mass - to - light ratio and the mass function slope ( see * ? ? ?",
    "7.7 , for a review ) .",
    "corresponding to the isothermal distribution @xcite , the maxwellian is expected to arise from relaxation phenomena like the interaction between the stars and the rapidly varying mean potential during the ` violent relaxation ' subsequent to the cluster formation @xcite , or the close random stellar encounters ( before the onset of gravothermal oscillations , see @xcite , sect .  8.4 , and references therein )",
    ".    nevertheless , the isothermal sphere has infinite mass and , moreover , the spatial extent of a real system can not be infinite , also because of the presence of the external galactic field , thus some kind of cutoff for high - energy stars at a given tidal radius @xmath5 must be included . among the various possibilities ,",
    "the ` lowered ' maxwellian proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , on the basis of fokker - planck calculations , has been the most successful one , both because of easy of computation and implementation and because of the rather good agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "then , after the first results achieved with single component ( i.e. equal star mass ) models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it was clear that to reproduce the observed surface brightness profiles it is often necessary to include stellar objects with different mass , i.e. multi - component dfs",
    ".    a general form for a @xmath6-component isotropic df can be given as a linear combination of single lowered maxwellians @xcite : f(r , v)=_k=1^n c_k f_k(r , v ) , [ df ] with f_k(r , v)=\\ {    ll e^-e/^2_k-1 , & + 0 , &    .",
    "[ dfk ] being @xmath7 the energy per unit mass and @xmath8 the mean total potential defined so to have @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 are normalization constants related with the global mass function , and the parameters @xmath11 are connected to the velocity dispersion and depend on the stellar mass @xmath12 of the components ( and , as we will see , on their concentration ) .    in these models ,",
    "the inclusion of the star mass as a further degree of freedom makes that another dynamical process can be taken into account : the energy equipartition that is expected to occur in the denser regions via 2-body collisions between stars with different masses @xcite . an important consequence of this phenomenon , that has been found on various globular clusters by means of _ hst _ ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , vlt @xcite and sdss observations @xcite , is the ` mass segregation ' , i.e. a ` drift ' of low - mass stars towards orbits located mainly in the cluster outskirts while heavier stars tend to concentrate in the inner region .",
    "for this reason , these multi - mass models have been used also in @xmath13-body simulations of clusters evolution to generate mass - segregated initial conditions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when accurate enough kinematical data became available , the so - called king - michie ( km ) models , in which the df of eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) includes velocity anisotropy through the dependence of @xmath10 on angular moment , have been employed in order to reproduce the steep decrease in the projected velocity dispersion observed in many clusters @xcite .",
    "indeed , some degree of anisotropy in the cluster outer regions should be present as a reminiscence of the initial , quasi - radial , collapse phase of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "this is also an important issue from a stellar dynamics point of view , because it is still unclear up to what extent this anisotropy can ` survive ' the isotropising effect of the tidal field @xcite .",
    "the most serious disadvantage of this ` model - building ' approach is that many , and more and more , degrees of freedom have to be included in order to improve the fit with the observed profiles ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that were also proved to poorly constraint all the various parameters @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the alternative ` non - parametric ' approach was proposed @xcite in which the relevant globular clusters features can be directly extracted by the observed profiles without making any assumptions on the form of the underlying df behaviour and the mass function form @xcite . ] .",
    "nevertheless , such an approach gives _ no _ direct indications on what are the actual dynamical mechanisms that determine the cluster evolution .",
    "for this reason , in our opinion , the parametric technique can still provide a valuable help in the comprehension of globular clusters dynamics , especially when used in conjunction with the non - parametric approach in order to test the validity of the various physical assumptions made in writing the form of the given df .",
    "for instance , it still remains an intriguing problem that of understanding why the form of the giants df found by @xcite in their non - parametric study of the two non - collapsed clusters ngc 362 and ngc 3201 , is clearly non - maxwellian in the central region .    by the way , it is crucial that all the dynamical mechanisms taking into account in the parametric method are correctly and coherently ` implemented ' . nevertheless , in all the km multi - mass models employed so far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the energy equipartition is ensured just by setting the square of the velocity parameter of a star component as @xmath14 , which is a prescription that is only asymptotically correct in the limit of isothermal df .",
    "various authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have already pointed out that such an ` isothermal approximation ' does not strictly imply the central equipartition of kinetic energy between stars of different mass .",
    "moreover , @xcite drew interesting conclusions on the ` equipartition instability ' that he re - considered on models with exact central equipartition .",
    "nevertheless , one may still think that the isothermal approximation leads , after all , to a central energy equipartition that is , to practical purposes , always acceptable . to this regard ,",
    "following @xcite , we construct multi - component models in which exact equipartition of kinetic energy is enforced at the centre ( sect .",
    "[ exact ] ) and , in sect .",
    "[ consequence ] , compare their properties and fitting parameters with those of models constructed in the standard way .",
    "discussions and conclusions can then be found in sect .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "in eq .  ( [ dfk ] ) , the non - isothermal nature of @xmath15 , due to the presence of the term @xmath16 , makes each component velocity dispersion to depend on the position @xmath17 , such that _ global _ equipartition is , in fact , impossible . by the way , a global equipartition would be unrealistic for globular clusters since in their outer regions relaxation time is supposed to be longer than their age .",
    "nevertheless , such an equipartition is expected to occur at the centre ( @xmath18 ) where the relaxation time is shortest @xcite .",
    "this local equipartition can be formally ensured by imposing the relations : m_k = m_1 , [ equip ] where the first mass class is chosen as the ` reference ' component , without the loss of generality , and @xmath19 denotes the modulus square of the velocity of the stars in the @xmath20-th component at @xmath18 , i.e. = _ 0^w f_k(0,v)v^4dv /_0^w f_k(0,v)v^2dv . , [ v_i ] with @xmath21 the escape velocity , being @xmath22 the central potential .",
    "in the following , @xmath23 denotes the dimensionless central potential and , moreover , when referring to a quantity of the generic @xmath20-th component , for simplicity the index @xmath20 is omitted ( if unambiguous ) .",
    "+ it can be shown that : @xmath24 = e^w w^-3/2(w ) - - , [ eq1 ] @xmath25 = e^w w^-5/2 ( ) - - - , [ eq2 ] with @xmath26 the error function . using the relations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , eq.([v_i ] )",
    "can be rewritten , after some terms rearrangement , as = ^2w(w ) , [ vsq ] where one defines @xmath27 @xmath28%\\times\\ ] ] ^-1 .",
    "[ kappa ] hence the constraint ( [ equip ] ) , imposes that @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , being @xmath30 , the central equipartition leads to the following relation for @xmath4 : m(w)=m_1(w_1 ) .",
    "[ equip0 ] given @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the quantity @xmath4 can be found for any component provided the knowledge of the inverse function of @xmath33 , which exists for @xmath34 and @xmath35  being @xmath36 a monotonically decreasing continuous function ( fig .",
    "[ fig_kappa ] )  and which can be easily computed by numerical means ( e.g. using the bisection algorithm ) .",
    "thus , w=^-1((w_1 ) ) .",
    "[ equip2 ] then , once given @xmath37 , the parameter @xmath38 for any other component is determined by the relation : ^2=_1 ^ 2 .",
    "[ sigma_i ] note that , since @xmath39 , eq .",
    "( [ equip0 ] ) implies the existence of a _ lower limit _ for the stellar mass in the components , in fact one has that m > ( w_1)m_1.[lowlimit ] this is just a direct consequence of the obvious condition @xmath40 and it means that , if exact equipartition is achieved in the _ central _ region of a real cluster , objects with a mass lower than the limit imposed by condition ( [ lowlimit ] ) acquire enough energy to escape from the system .",
    "hence , they can be present there only if they are bound in multiple systems formed before 2-body relaxation takes place ( eg .",
    ", light remnants in primordial binaries ) . in this respect , note that for a component with such light objects , it might be appropriate to multiply the @xmath15 of eq.([dfk ] ) by a factor that depopulates the phase - space region with low angular momentum @xmath41 , so as to make its inclusion in the model consistent with the equipartition . a suitable factor",
    "could be , e.g. , 1-(-l^2/2r^2__k^2 ) , being the ` avoidance radius ' , @xmath42 , a further free parameter .",
    "notice , finally , that with the typical values @xmath43 and @xmath44 , eq .",
    "( [ lowlimit ] ) yields @xmath45 .     defined in eq.([kappa ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig_kappa],width=321 ]      as known , the central dimensionless potential @xmath4 determines the ` form ' , the shape , of the density distribution given by the @xmath15 of eq .",
    "( [ dfk ] ) , being the other parameters ( e.g. @xmath38 and @xmath48 ) just scaling factors . in particular , @xmath4 is directly related to the king _ concentration _ coefficient @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the king radius ; they satisfy the approximate linear relation @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "then , when @xmath52 it is clear that the presence of the tidal cut will have a negligible role , in fact one can say that @xmath53 at the centre and for small velocities ( @xmath54 ) , hence the @xmath15 approaches an isothermal df whose velocity dispersion is @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the ` isothermal approximation ' ( hereafter ia ) yields , from eq .",
    "( [ equip ] ) , the commonly adopted equipartition condition ^2_1 ^ 2 , [ equip_iso ] which allows to determine @xmath38 for any component and , in turn , to evaluate its central dimensionless potential as @xmath56 .    note that under the ia , eq.([kappa ] )",
    "correctly leads to the same condition since the @xmath57 term dominates for @xmath52 , giving @xmath58 , hence eq .",
    "( [ equip0 ] ) , for @xmath52 and @xmath59 , gives just @xmath60 .",
    "it is now worth checking and quantifying more precisely the goodness of the ia : let us evaluate the actual ` temperature ' ratio @xmath61 between a generic component and the reference one at the centre of the cluster , and compare it with the unitary value actually demanded by the equipartition . from eq .",
    "( [ vsq ] ) we have that = = = . [ tsut1 ] in fig.[fig_tratio ] this ratio is plotted for various values of @xmath31 as a function of the mass ratio @xmath32 .",
    "as expected , the isothermal approximation works better , i.e. @xmath61 is closer to the unit , for higher @xmath31 and for @xmath62 , because in these regimes the df of both components are closer to the isothermal distribution .",
    "however , although one can affirm that the dynamical condition of central ` thermal equilibrium ' is approximately valid within a limited range of masses and for sufficiently concentrated models , nevertheless the model structure is rather sensitive to the temperature ratio .",
    "let us consider the quantity = , [ wiso ] where @xmath4 is given by eq .",
    "( [ equip2 ] ) .",
    "this ratio quantifies the change affecting the fundamental structural parameter of the clusters profile , when the ia is adopted instead of the exact energy equipartition .     and a ` reference ' one having mass @xmath63 and @xmath31 as labelled , when the energy equipartition is imposed using the ` isothermal approximation ' .",
    "the thick line marks the low - mass cutoff given by ( [ lowlimit ] ) .",
    "[ fig_tratio],width=321 ]    as shown by fig.[fig_epsilon ] , one can see that @xmath64 can be _ very _ different from @xmath4 , especially for low concentration models , e.g. for non - collapsed globular clusters ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "in particular , given a pair of components , the use of the ia implies a _ higher _ concentration for the component with lighter stars , and a _ lower _",
    "concentration for the heavier stars .",
    "in other words , with respect to the correct energy equipartition assumption , the ia leads to a _ reduced _ mass segregation .    , and that turned out by the correct energy equipartition with a ` reference ' component having mass @xmath63 and various @xmath31 .",
    "the vertical asymptotes correspond to the @xmath66 lower limit ( [ lowlimit]).[fig_epsilon],width=321 ]    then , as a consequence on the parametric fitting of globular clusters profiles , one expects that , once adjusted the distribution of the brightest stars component ( giants and turn - off stars ) to fit the observed luminosity profile , the ia gives : ( i ) a steeper and too much concentrated mass density profile in the outer regions , being this determined by the lighter ( dwarf main sequence ) stars mostly ; ( ii ) a flatter density profile for the massive remnants in the core region ; ( iii ) a steeper radial velocity dispersion profile for the giants , as a consequence of the steeper decreasing of the potential .",
    "point ( i ) implies then a lower total cluster mass , and so a lower mass - to - luminosity ratio , in respect to the exact energy equipartition .",
    "notice that all this discussion remains valid also in the case of km models where the presence of velocity anisotropy is considered .",
    "indeed , in these models , the coefficients @xmath10 in eq.([df ] ) are equal to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the length - scale above which anisotropy is important and @xmath69 is the further state variable corresponding to the modulus of the tangential velocity ( see appendix [ construction ] ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath18 there is no anisotropy and @xmath70 is independent of @xmath71 .",
    "to understand better the effects of the ia on the models morphogical and kinematical features , a simple case of an isotropic ( @xmath72 ) 3-component model is considered . though representing a crude simplification in respect to real clusters with a continuous mass spectrum , it is sufficient to provide significant indications on the consequences of the approximation we are discussing .",
    "the model is made up of : ( i ) giant and turn - off stars ( @xmath73 , total mass @xmath74 ) , determining the light profile ; ( ii ) main sequence dwarf stars and light remnants ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) , considered to be dark , but dominating the gravitational potential ; ( iii ) heavy dark remnants ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 , remnants of objects with mass in the range @xmath79@xmath80 ) .",
    "all is consistent with a mass function @xmath81 with @xmath82 , and with condition ( [ lowlimit ] ) .",
    "the surface brightness profiles correspond to a concentration parameter @xmath83 . in fig .",
    "[ prova1 ] the surface brightness and the projected line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles given adopting the ia and the exact equipartition , are shown for a comparison . the radius is given in unit of the _ core _ radius , @xmath84 , at which the luminosity drops to @xmath85 the central value .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 has been adjusted in such a way to give similar light profiles in both cases .",
    ", width=321 ]    thus , confirming the points discussed at the end of sect .",
    "[ isoapp ] , the ia gives a @xmath86 profile appreciably steeper than in the correct case .",
    "the cluster envelope is also too concentrated ( @xmath87 instead of the correct @xmath88 ) and the massive remnants have a much flatter density profile in the core region ( @xmath89 instead of @xmath90 ) .",
    "though to a less extent , this occurs also in the presence of velocity anisotropy , as shown in fig.[prova1an ] . moreover , the difference is lower also when a less peaked mass function is adopted , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ prova2 ] that refers to the same isotropic model above - described , but with @xmath91 , i.e. with : @xmath73 ; @xmath92 , @xmath93 ; @xmath77 , @xmath94 .",
    "of course , in this case the reduced discrepancy is due to the less importance of the lightest component in determining the overall potential .     but with an anisotropy radius @xmath95 [ prova1an],width=321 ]     but with a flatter mass function ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "[ prova2],width=321 ]    now , to quantify the change affecting all the relevant parameters because of the use of the ia , these have to be compared with the fitting parameters that , under the correct energy equipartition , give the same projected surface brightness _ and _ velocity dispersion profiles . in fig .",
    "[ prova_coinc ] the profiles corresponding to a typical non - collapsed cluster ( @xmath96 in this case ) , are plotted .",
    "the resulting parameters are written in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "besides the difference in the lightest component concentration , one can immediately see the discrepancy in the total mass ( and so in the mass - to - light ratio ) and in the mass function index .",
    "in this example , the ia leads to a @xmath2 times lower total mass and to a steeper mass function , @xmath97 instead of @xmath98 , giving an amount of mass in heavy remnants which is @xmath3 times lower .

[ prova_coinc],width=321 ]",
    "in the multi - mass king - michie models usually employed for the study of morphology and kinematics of globular clusters , the energy equipartition at the cluster centre , between stars of different masses , is imposed by setting the square of the velocity parameter of the @xmath20-th mass class , @xmath99 in the df of eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) , inversely proportional to the mass , @xmath100 , of that component . as @xcite and @xcite emphasized ,",
    "this is correct only in the limit of isothermal distributions ( i.e. with central dimensionless potential @xmath101 ) .",
    "this ` isothermal approximation ' ( ia ) has been checked and the consequences studied in this paper . to this purpose , a general procedure to construct @xmath6-component models with exact energy equipartition at the centre",
    "is used and described in detail .    from the point of view of the ` thermal equilibrium ' , it is found that the ` temperatures ' of a pair of components can differ to a non - negligible amount for low concentration distributions .",
    "for instance , taking a giant and turn - off stars component with mass @xmath102 having a concentration @xmath103 , along with a typical dwarf main - sequence star component with @xmath104 , one has that , under the ia , this latter component has a temperature ( @xmath105 ) which is actually a factor @xmath106 lower than that of the giants .    to investigate the consequences on the observable profiles ,",
    "a simple 3-component isotropic model was generated resembling roughly that of a typical non - collapsed cluster .",
    "aside from the two above - mentioned components , heavy remnants with @xmath107 were also included , while the components total mass were varied according to different mass function logarithmic index @xmath108 .",
    "once adjusted the giant profile to match the same light distribution , it is found that ( with @xmath82 ) the cluster envelope is much less concentrated in the exact equipartition case ( @xmath109 ) than under the ia ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "moreover , the ia gives a flatter density profile for the massive remnants in the core region ( @xmath111 instead of @xmath112 ) .",
    "as regards the velocity dispersion profile , the approximation leads to a steeper profile for the giants , as a consequence of the steeper decreasing of the potential .",
    "however , it is found that both the presence of anisotropy and lower mass function slopes reduce the variations in respect with the correct case .    then , in order to evaluate the change in the most relevant parameters , these were fixed so as to give the same projected surface brightness profile and the same line - of - sight velocity dispersion curve , with models constructed both with the correct energy equipartition and employing the ia . it is found that the inferred total mass ( and , correspondingly , the global mass - to - light ratio ) results @xmath2 times lower than the correct value , with a steeper mass function that leads to a @xmath3 times smaller amount of mass in heavy dark remnants .    by the results of this work",
    "it can be stated that the ia leads to multi - mass parametric fit of non - collapsed globular clusters profiles , corresponding to models _ not _ consistent with the assumption of energy equipartition at the centre .",
    "consequently , the estimate of many important parameters ( such as : total mass , mass - to - light ratio , mass function slope , heavy remnant abundances , etc . )",
    "is appreciably affected by the non - unitary ratio among central components temperatures . moreover , in the multi - mass models used so far , condition ( [ lowlimit ] ) is usually ignored . indeed , it is assumed the presence of centrally concentrated light objects ( light remnants or dwarf main sequence stars , with mass as low as @xmath113 ) that , on the contrary , should not be present in the central region , since they acquire there sufficient kinetic energy to leave the system .",
    "thus , though the models with ia can reproduce rather well the observable profiles , they are inconsistent with one of the dynamical processes ( energy equipartition ) they rely on .",
    "this is incoherent with the underlying ` philosophy ' of the parametric approach . by the way",
    ", if some dynamical constraints were relaxed without any theoretical justification , then non - parametric techniques would definitively be more appropriate .",
    "whether or not the energy equipartition takes actually place at the cluster centre is an entirely different problem ( to this regard , our opinion contrasts to what claimed in @xcite ) , framed into a still controversial subject . in this respect , it is worth noting that @xcite deduced , thanks to a parametric study of low - concentration clusters , a relatively high and sharp cutoff in the mass function , at @xmath114@xmath115 , for ngc 5466 and m55 , which is in good agreement with condition ( [ lowlimit ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xcite and @xcite _ hst _ deep photometric studies , concerning with the region around the half - mass radius of various clusters , indicates a general remarkable flattening of the mass function below @xmath116 .",
    "this was also observed , for higher masses , in the core of 47 tuc @xcite .",
    "then , energy equipartition is , at least , not contradicted by these observational evidences about the lacking of low - mass stars in the central regions of clusters .    from a theoretical point of view , besides the efficiency of 2-body collisions , also the relative importance that the different components have in determining the total gravitational potential influences much the equal distribution of kinetic energy among them and , as firstly envisaged by @xcite , it could be impossible , under certain conditions , to be attained . in a few words ,",
    "this happens when a much more massive stellar species ( with mass @xmath117 ) has a negligible influence on the overall potential determined by a much lighter one ( @xmath118 , but @xmath119 ) , so that the heavier stars get more and more concentrated ( while the others expand ) , becoming a self - gravitating system with a negative heat capacity .",
    "thus , the more kinetic energy it loses , the higher will be its temperature departing faster and faster and more and more away from the energy equipartition with the lighter component , leading to the so - called ` equipartition instability ' .",
    "though @xcite showed that equipartition never occurs in their fokker - plank models , @xcite and the more recent monte carlo simulations by @xcite have basically confirmed the original spitzer s criterion for a 2-component model . in this respect , one must note that neither the relation ( ) ( ) ^2.40.32 [ spitz ] suggested by @xcite for equipartition to occur , nor the spitzer s one , are satisfied for the 2nd and the 3rd components of our example models .",
    "we must remind , however , the @xcite conclusion , drawn by re - considering the spitzer s argument on models with exact central equipartition , affirming that this latter can be reached even if spitzer s condition is violated . perhaps , more convincing indications could be provided , in the near future , by direct and collisional @xmath13-body simulations with a sufficiently large @xmath13 and , more important , with a realistic mass function ( see the introductory discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to conclude",
    ", it can be stated that in the parametric study of low - concentration clusters , it appears appropriate to take particular care to the inclusion of the energy equipartition process in km multi - mass models , since the structure of each star component and , consequently , all the relevant parameters , are significantly influenced by the presence of thermal equilibrium at the centre .",
    "furthermore , the coherence of the parametric approach must be preserved to make significant comparison with the results of non - parametric ( or other ) techniques .",

    "<S> in the construction of multi - mass king - michie models of globular clusters , an approximated central energy equipartition between stars of different masses is usually imposed by scaling the velocity parameter of each mass class inversely with the stellar mass , as if the distribution function were isothermal . in this paper , this ` isothermal approximation ' ( ia ) has been checked and its consequences on the model parameters studied by a comparison with models including central energy equipartition correctly . it is found that , under the ia , the ` temperatures ' of a pair of components can differ to a non - negligible amount for low concentration distributions . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that , in general , this approximation leads to a significantly reduced mass segregation in comparison with that given under the exact energy equipartition at the centre . as a representative example , an isotropic 3-component model fitting a given projected surface brightness and line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles is discussed . in this example </S>",
    "<S> , the ia gives a cluster envelope much more concentrated ( central dimensionless potential @xmath0 ) than under the true equipartition ( @xmath1 ) , as well as a higher logarithmic mass function slope . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the inferred total mass ( and then the global mass - to - light ratio ) results a factor @xmath2 times lower than the correct value and the amount of mass in heavy dark remnants is @xmath3 times smaller . under energy equipartition , the fate of stars having a mass below a certain limit is to escape from the system . </S>",
