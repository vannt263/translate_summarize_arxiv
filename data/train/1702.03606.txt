    "we can now look at the connection graph @xmath46 of @xmath1 .",
    "its green function values are again related to unit spheres in the barycentric refinement @xmath47 of @xmath1 .",
    "we compare the unit sphere topologies in @xmath1 with the unit sphere topologies of @xmath47 .",
    "we show here that in @xmath47 , no new topologies appear .",
    "it follows that the sphere index spectrum , the set of green function values is a combinatorial invariant of a simplicial complex",
    "the quest to find invariants of topological spaces is particularly concrete when searching for combinatorial invariants in abstract finite simplicial complexes .",
    "these are quantities which do not change when applying a barycentric refinement @xcite .",
    "abstract simplicial complexes have a surprisingly rich geometry despite the fact that they are one of the simplest objects mathematics knows . every partially ordered set for example defines a complex , the order complex . besides matroids also graphs are a source for complexes , like subcomplexes of the clique complex or then graphic matroids .",
    "other type of simplicial complexes were introduced by jonsson in @xcite .",
    "graph theory enters naturally as any barycentric refinement @xmath1 of an arbitrary abstract simplicial complex is already is the whitney clique complex of a graph .",
    "the faces of @xmath0 are the vertices of @xmath1 and two faces connected if one is contained in the other .",
    "the complex @xmath0 also defines the connection graph @xmath2 on the same vertex set , where two simplices connect if they intersect .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath2 produce aspects of the geometry on @xmath0 which are well accessible as graphs are not only intuitive , they also serve well as data structures",
    ". + examples of combinatorial invariants of simplicial complexes are simplicial cohomology , euler characteristic , homotopy groups ( discrete notions of spheres and discrete notions of homotopy allow them purely combinatorically ) , the bott invariants @xcite , the clique number ( which is @xmath48 plus the maximal dimension ) , minimal entries of a @xmath49-vector @xcite , wu characteristic , as well as connection cohomology attached to wu characteristic @xcite or minimal possible entries in the @xmath49-matrix .",
    "examples of quantities which are not combinatorial invariants are the @xmath49-vector itself ( as it gets multiplied by a fixed upper triangular matrix when applying a refinement ) , the @xmath49-matrix , telling about the cardinalities pair intersections , the chromatic number ( it can decrease under refinements but will stabilize already after one step to the clique number ) or dimension ( it can increase under refinements and will converge to the maximal dimension when iterating the barycentric refinement process ) , neither is the fredholm characteristic @xmath50 ( as it stabilizes to @xmath48 already after one barycentric refinement ) . +    focusing on finite simplicial complexes",
    "@xmath0 allows to do geometry on finite sets but still be close to classical topology : the topology of a smooth compact manifold @xmath51 for example is completely determined by the topology of the simplicial complex @xmath0 defined by a triangulation of @xmath51 in the form of a @xmath52-graph and the abstract whitney complex describing it contains all topological information about @xmath51 . while it is possible to look at topological invariants by embedding the complex into a continuum or by realizing it as a polytop in an euclidean space , we prefer here to look at invariants defined and computed in a finite combinatorial manner",
    "this is pragmatic computer science point of view . +",
    "both the set of abstract finite simplicial complexes as well as the set of finite simple graphs form a boolean lattice : one can intersect and take unions .",
    "they both do not form a boolean ring however as the boolean addition , the symmetric difference operation , @xmath53 is no more in the same category .",
    "a valuation is a numerical quantity @xmath26 satisfying @xmath54 .",
    "if we had a boolean ring , a valuation would satisfy the linearity condition @xmath55 . by discrete hadwiger ,",
    "any valuation is of the form @xmath56 , where @xmath40 is a fixed vector and @xmath57 is the @xmath49-vector of @xmath0 . since the only eigenvector of the barycentric operator @xmath58 is @xmath59 euler characteristic is the only combinatorial invariant which is also a valuation .",
    "while euler characteristic @xmath60 with @xmath61 is pretty unique among valuations , there are other functionals .",
    "one is the fermi characteristic @xmath62 , a multiplicative cousin of euler characteristic .",
    "+ then there are multi - variate versions like the wu characteristic @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the @xmath49-matrix @xmath65 counting the number of intersections of @xmath66 and @xmath67-dimenensional simplices in the complex . also the wu characteristic as well as higher order versions are combinatorial invariants . a quadratic valuation @xmath68 is a map for which @xmath69 and @xmath70 are both valuations .",
    "related to this had been a question of gruenbaum @xcite , whether higher order dehn - sommerville relations exist .",
    "we answered this affirmatively in @xcite .",
    "the analysis there shows that wu characteristic is the only combinatorial invariant among multi - linear valuations .",
    "connection calculus leads to other combinatorial invariants like the betti numbers of connection cohomology . that this is useful",
    "has already been demonstrated in examples .",
    "it allows to distinguish the cylinder and the moebius strip for example .",
    "+ quantities satisfying the multiplicative valuation property @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 must be additive valuations after taking logs and indeed , the fredholm determinant is an example .",
    "it is related to the valuation @xmath57 counting the number of odd - dimensional simplices in @xmath0 .",
    "+ we should point out that cohomology with real - valued cocycles is well defined also for a finitist who does not accept infinity .",
    "the reason is that the cohomology groups are determined by hodge as the nullity @xmath74 of finite integer - valued matrices @xmath75 , the form laplacians @xmath75 .",
    "the dimension of the kernel as well as the kernel basis itself can be obtained by row reduction , which is a finite process and done on integer matrices .",
    "so , cohomology is an acceptable concept for a finitist . for more about the complexity ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this happens already when following the lead of kirchhoff , betti and poincar . in topology however still , euclidean realizations are used even for definitions like barycentric refinements .",
    "but one perfectly can stay within the realm of simplicial complexes or better in the realm of much the more accessible graph category , on which the complex is a subcomplex of the whitney clique complex .",
    "+ how do simplicial complexes relate to traditional topology ?",
    "the usual approach is to realize the complex in some sufficiently high dimensional euclidean space and call two complexes @xmath76 topologically equivalent if their topological realizations @xmath77 are homeomorphic in the classical point set topology sense .",
    "a topological invariant of the complex is then a quantity produces homeomorphic geometric realizations . for abstract finite simplicial complexes ,",
    "the notion of topological invariant is equivalent to the notion of combinatorial invariant but the later works in the more restricted axiom system of finite mathematics .",
    "+ the quest to find a complete finite set of invariants which allow to distinguish an arbitrary pair of simplicial complexes has long shown to be unattainable : it is not possible to build a turing machine which can distinguish any pair of abstract finite simplicial complexes .",
    "markov used in 1958 the unsolvability of the word problem by novikov to show that the homeomorphism problem is not solvable . for surveys , see @xcite .",
    "+ a constructivist would insist on giving a concrete homeomorphism which establishes the topological equivalence , but this is not so easy , as the euclidean realizations are piecewise linear pieces of simplices , glued together in some high dimensional space . also the complexity to decide whether a given pair of finite simplicial complexes are topologically equivalent",
    "can be tough .",
    "given two concrete complexes , how do we ( by just dealing with finite sets ) decide whether they are topologically equivalent ?",
    "we need other morphism for simplicial complexes in order to mirror topological equivalence .",
    "one answer is to use a finite zariski type topologies which is purely combinatorial .",
    "it is conceivable however that we have to go through an exponentially large set of possible admissible finite topologies and check in each case the graph isomorphism problem .",
    "+ let us assume that the complex is the whitney complex of a graph . as mentioned already ,",
    "this is not much of a loss of generality as a barycentric refinement of an abstract simplicial complex is always the whitney complex of a graph .",
    "since a graph has a natural metric , the geodesic distance , one could see such a complex as an example of a finite metric space .",
    "but since every singleton set @xmath78 is both open and closed in that metric , the topology is the discrete topology and not that interesting .",
    "a weaker topology is zariski like : it the topology on the vertex set of @xmath1 defined in such a way that the vertex set of @xmath79 of any subcomplex @xmath80 of @xmath0 is closed .",
    "this defines a finite topology on the vertex set of @xmath1 , ( which is in general not hausdorff similarly as zariski topology ) , the homeomorphisms are still the graph isomorphisms .",
    "( the analogy is that subgraphs of @xmath0 play the role of varieties and homeomorphism the role of regular maps .",
    "the algebraic nature of the  varieties \" comes from the fact that we only allow subgraphs of @xmath0 and not subgraphs of @xmath1 .",
    "the later would give the discrete topology . )",
    "+ the zariski idea is more flexible as we can use the same definition to form much weaker topologies by starting with a smaller set of subgraphs of @xmath0 defining a sub - base of the topology . for example , we can get topologies on the second refinement @xmath47 by taking the set of graphs @xmath81 as closed , where @xmath80 is a subgraph of @xmath80 .",
    "we have proposed @xcite to insist that a finite topology on a graph should be given by a subbase and have the property that the nerve graph of a sub - base should be homotopic to the graph and that a dimension condition is satisfied for intersections .",
    "the reasons are that we want any reasonable notion of cohomology to agree with the natural topology of the graph and insist that any notion of homeomorphism should honor the concept of dimension .",
    "+ unlike the quest to find a complete set of invariants for a simplicial complex , the task to find concrete combinatorial invariants of an abstract simplicial complex is more accessible .",
    "it is part of what we do here .",
    "an example of quantities which are interesting are valuations satisfying @xmath82 .",
    "the discrete hadwiger theorem @xcite has classified all valuations on a complex and identified euler characteristic as the only combinatorial invariant among them .",
    "it states that if the maximal dimension of @xmath0 is @xmath52 , the space of valuations is @xmath83 dimensional .",
    "more invariants can be obtained by looking a multi - linear valuations or multiplicative invariants @xmath84 like fredholm characteristic .",
    "+ since fredholm characteristic @xmath85 is @xmath86-valued for simplicial complexes we can look at the green function values @xmath87 .",
    "investigating these integers led to the current paper .",
    "it is here related to locally defined combinatorial invariants , the sphere euler characteristic spectrum , which is defined by the collection of indices @xmath88 which unit spheres @xmath5 in the complex can have .",
    "one could look at higher order versions like the quadratic sphere spectrum @xmath89 , where @xmath90 run both over all the simplices in @xmath0 .",
    "this however does not match the off - diagonal green function values in general and the off - diagonal values @xmath91 with @xmath92 remain at the moment still unidentified .",
    "analogies from physics suggest that all green function values should have some natural interpretation and are possibly of a dynamical nature .",
    "work like @xcite show how close the discrete case can be to the continuum . in the shifted fredholm case , it is exciting that the green function values are integers and quantized .",
    "there would be other numbers to consider like @xmath93 but we seem only get topological invariants for @xmath94 .",
    "+ in the context of doing arithmetic on graphs , the proof uses join operations . in @xcite pp.21 the definition is attributed to a.a .",
    "zykov who introduced it in 1949 @xcite .",
    "there should be no confusion with the notion of  join \" used for partially order sets and especially for simplicial complexes @xcite .",
    "topologically , the zykov join of two graphs has the same properties as in the continuum and which appear in textbooks like @xcite . in the discrete",
    ", the construction does not need to take any quotient topologies : the vertex set of the join of two graphs is the union of the vertex sets and the edge set is the union of the edge sets of the factors together with all pairs belonging to different graphs .",
    "the zero element @xmath27 is the empty graph . as in the continuum , the sum of two spheres is a sphere again . adding @xmath48 to a graph @xmath95 is the cone construction .",
    "+ unlike for the arithmetic of numbers , where @xmath48 is the only additive prime , there are more additive primes in the join monoid .",
    "the @xmath27-dimensional sphere @xmath96 for example is prime .",
    "adding such a sphere to a graph is the suspension .",
    "the maximal dimension of a sum @xmath97 is the sum of the maximal dimensions plus @xmath48 .",
    "but there are still mysteries about the zykov monoid .",
    "unlike in the continuum , we suspect ( but do not know nor dare to conjecture ) that in the discrete , the join operation is a unique factorization monoid , where the empty graph plays the role of the @xmath27 element and where the 1-point graph @xmath98 is the smallest example of an additive prime .",
    "the complete graph @xmath99 decomposes as @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be written as @xmath102 .",
    "we can how for example that a triangulation of a 2d - surface of positive genus is prime , as the only 2d - surfaces which can be factored are of the form @xmath103 which are all 2-spheres which are prism graphs for @xmath104 .",
    "+ by looking at the numerical quantity of maximal dimension , we can see that every graph @xmath0 factors additively into primes @xmath105 , but we do nt know yet whether the factorization is unique .",
    "[ i could not get hold yet of the zykov article @xcite .",
    "the mathscinet review of tutte mentions a unique prime factorization result there .",
    "] we have infinitely many prime graphs , like graphs @xmath106 without edges , circular graphs @xmath107 with @xmath108 or disconnected graphs .",
    "a spectral condition is given at the end of this article . in some sense , our understanding of this arithmetic is on the level of euclid , who did not prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic yet .",
    "but unique prime factorization might not even hold in the sphere sub - monoid within that graph monoid . the sphere monoid might be the easier one to attack . but already there , for each positive dimension , there are infinitely many prime spheres : the number of maximal simplices of @xmath97 is the product of the number of simplices of @xmath0 and @xmath80 .",
    "a sphere with a prime number of maximal simplices therefore is an additive prime in the sphere monoid . in general , the euler generating functions @xmath109 for the join satisfies @xmath110 , which has as a corollary @xmath111 which follows from @xmath112 .",
    "this formula implies that @xmath113 is multiplicative and that graphs with zero euler characteristic , or graphs with even euler characteristic and graphs with odd euler characteristic all form sub - monoids .",
    "+ at the end we point out that there is a multiplication on simplicial complexes which is compatible with the zykov join addition in the sense that distributivity holds .",
    "if the zykov join monoid is extended to become a group we get so a commutative ring of simplicial complexes .",
    "this ring extends naturally the ring of integers as it contains the ring of integers in the form of complete graphs : @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the empty graph @xmath27 is the zero element and the graph @xmath98 is the @xmath48-element .",
    "we originally looked for a ring structure in order to proof the unimodularity theorem .",
    "a purely algebraic proof has not worked yet and might not even exist .",
    "indeed , the fredholm functional @xmath50 is only multiplicative on the additive subgroup of signed complexes which have even euler characteristic . but",
    "@xmath50 is a character on the sphere subgroup of the additive group similarly as the poincar - hopf functional @xmath116 which is a character on the sphere group and which plays here an important role .",
