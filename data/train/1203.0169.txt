    "<S> we discuss the consistency of the gdel metric within the chern - simons modified gravity , both for external and dynamical chern - simons coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> the four - dimensional chern - simons ( cs ) modified gravity has been recently intensively studied within different contexts . the main reason for this consists in the fact that this theory , being a straightforward generalization of the three - dimensional cs modified gravity@xcite , and formulated initially in@xcite can be naturally treated as a simple example of the cpt breaking gravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> further , a lot of interesting results has been obtained for the cs modified gravity , such as birefringence of the gravitational waves within this model@xcite , modification of orbits around the earth due to the gravitational cs term@xcite , post - newtonian expansion@xcite , cosmological impacts@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in@xcite the dynamical generation of the gravitational cs term via perturbative corrections was carried out .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the principal lines of study of the cs modified gravity is a study of consistency of the known spacetime solutions within this theory . </S>",
    "<S> already in@xcite this compatibility has been shown for the schwarzschild metric . </S>",
    "<S> further , in@xcite it was proved that the solutions of the usual einstein equations possessing certain symmetries , in particular , spherically symmetric and axisymmetric ones , solve the equations of motion of the cs modified gravity as well .    </S>",
    "<S> another important solution is the gdel metric@xcite , which is the first known metric allowing for the breaking of causality through possibility of the closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> a lot of issues related to this metric has been considered earlier@xcite , including , in particular , constructing of its generalizations and study of the possibilities of arising the ctcs within these generalizations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the natural question is  whether the gdel metric@xcite is consistent within the cs modified gravity ? </S>",
    "<S> in other words , whether the cs modified gravity allows for existence of the ctcs ? in this paper we are interested in verifying whether the gdel solution holds in the cs modified gravity , both for external and dynamical cs terms .    </S>",
    "<S> we start our study with the introduction of the gdel metric which is written as@xcite @xmath0,\\label{godel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a positive number . </S>",
    "<S> the non - zero christoffel symbols corresponding to this metric look like @xmath2 the non - zero components of the riemann tensor are @xmath3 the corresponding non - zero components of the ricci tensor look like @xmath4 finally , the ricci scalar is @xmath5 it is known@xcite that the gdel metric solves the einstein equations @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a unit time - like vector of the form @xmath8 , and its covariant components are @xmath9 , if @xmath10    now , let us modify the gravity action by adding the gravitational cs term@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the resulting cs modified gravity action looks like @xmath11 + s_{mat},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the scalar curvature , @xmath13 is the matter action and @xmath14 is the pontryagin term : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the riemann tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath17 is a scalar field called the cs coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> it can be treated as an external one or dynamical one . within this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we consider both these possibilities .    </S>",
    "<S> after integration by parts , introducing @xmath18 , we get @xmath19 that is , the usual gravitational cs term . </S>",
    "<S> varying the action ( [ smod ] ) with respect to the metric , we obtain the modified einstein equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cotton tensor arising due to the varying of the additive cs term , its explicit form is@xcite @xmath22 \\,+\\ , ( \\mu\\longleftrightarrow\\nu ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the covariant divergence of this tensor is @xmath24 first , let us suggest that @xmath17 is the external field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it does not contribute to the energy - momentum tensor of the matter , which hence has the same form as in the usual case@xcite : @xmath25 , that is , just the r.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> of the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ein ] ) using the bianchi identity , @xmath26 , and suggesting that the matter terms are diffeomorphism invariant , i.e. @xmath27 , one finds that the solution of the equation ( [ einst ] ) requires a consistency condition @xmath28 , i.e. the diffeomorphism symmetry breaking is suppressed on - shell ( for more details see@xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as the gdel metric solves the usual einstein equations , it can solve the modified ones if and only if the cotton tensor vanishes for such a metric . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward analysis shows that this situation takes place only if @xmath29 therefore , for this specific choice of the cs coefficient , we find that the gdel metric is compatible with the cs modified gravity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the possibility for existence of the ctcs persists in the cs modified gravity .    </S>",
    "<S> now , let us suggest that the @xmath17 is dynamical . in this case , the action of the cs modified gravity is @xmath30 + s_{mat}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding equations of motion look like @xmath31    the energy - momentum tensor @xmath32 is now a sum of two terms : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy - momentum tensor of an usual matter with a cosmological term given by the r.h.s . of the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ein ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , the energy - momentum tensor for the @xmath17 field has the usual form corresponding to the scalar field in a curved space : @xmath35    now , let us suggest that @xmath17 has the form ( [ thf ] ) , that is , the cotton tensor vanishes . in this case , knowing the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature for the gdel metric@xcite , one can write down the nontrivial components of the einstein equations , 00 , 11 , 22 and 33 respectively : @xmath36,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}&=&-\\lambda a^2+\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_1\\theta)^2-e^{-2x}(\\partial_2\\theta)^2\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{3}{2}&=&16\\pi g\\rho a^2+\\lambda a^2+\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_1\\theta)^2+e^{-2x}(\\partial_2\\theta)^2\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}&=&-\\lambda a^2-\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_1\\theta)^2+e^{-2x}(\\partial_2\\theta)^2\\right].\\label{33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equations for the components 00 and 02 turn out to coincide identically . moreover , the component 12 of modified einstein equations is @xmath37 one can verify that the gdel metric is compatible only with the trivial potential , at least if we want to preserve the condition of vanishing the cotton tensor .    </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward inspection of these components allows to conclude that solutions of the einstein equations can be formally written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 therefore , the consistency of the equations of motion requires the cosmological constant not to be constant but , instead , to be a function of spatial coordinates . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , spatial variability of the cosmological constant has been discussed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this scenario seems to be rather exotic , in particular , because it violates homogeneity of space .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss our results . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the situation with the compatibility of the gdel metric with the cs modified gravity is essentially different in the case of the external cs coefficient and dynamical cs coefficient . indeed , while in the first case the compatibility is achieved for the special value of @xmath17 , in the second case the cancellation of the cotton tensor is not sufficient  </S>",
    "<S> one must have the variable cosmological constant which violates the principle of homogeneity of space and conservation of the energy - momentum tensor . </S>"
