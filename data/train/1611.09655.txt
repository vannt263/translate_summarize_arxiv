    "the square - lattice ising model first solved by lars onsager in 1944 @xcite is probably the most famous one . within the statistical mechanics picture ,",
    "the magnetization starts to fluctuate as the temperature deviates from zero resulting in the reduction of the ground - state magnetization .",
    "as the temperature approaches the critical value , the fluctuations are extremely developed and the magnetization vanishes . finally , it is zero for all temperatures above the critical temperature .",
    "interestingly , there is a similar picture for a quantum many - particle system being in the ground state ( i.e. , at zero temperature ) where fluctuations have quantum nature .",
    "the temperature can not serve as the control parameter .",
    "rather , external pressure , magnetic field or competing terms in the hamiltonian etc . may be appropriate to tune the strength of quantum fluctuations , i.e. , these parameters can drive the transition at zero temperature .",

    "while in the pure ising model ( @xmath6 ) no quantum fluctuations are present , the term with the transverse field does neither commute with the ising interaction nor with the operator of the order parameter @xmath7 , thus introducing quantum fluctuations . clearly ,",

    "in what follows we call model ( [ 201 ] ) the @xmath0 model .",

    "rather , the ground state is a more complex many - body state with nel - type long - range order , where the sublattice magnetization is reduced by quantum fluctuations to about 60% of the classical value @xcite .",

    "thus , we expect that at some critical value of the ratio @xmath22 , a phase transition between the magnetically ordered nel phase and the valence - bond singlet phase without magnetic order occurs .",
    "let us emphasize that for the ising model and also for classical heisenberg spins ( i.e. , @xmath23 stands for the classical vector of the length @xmath24 ) the nel state is the ground state for all values of antiferromagnetic @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and no transition takes place at all .",

[ fig10 ] . clearly , the spin state at all sites shown in the two upper panels of fig .

    "to summarize , we have considered a mean - field like approach for the analysis of quantum phase transitions in quantum spin systems with competing antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "this scheme can be cast into the standard landau s paradigm of phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , the method is rather transparent and simple from the calculation point of view .",
    "this method provides reasonably good estimates for quantum critical points , and the critical behavior falls into the mean - field universality class . because of the local character of the variational ansatz ( [ 301 ] ) , this method can not distinguish between various distinct patterns for the arrangement of dimers and therefore it can not provide more refined information on the features of the quantum phase transition .",
