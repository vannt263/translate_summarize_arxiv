    "let @xmath0 be a lie algebra equipped with an inner product @xmath1 . consider the corresponding simply connected lie group @xmath2 equipped with the left invariant riemannian metric determined by @xmath1 .",
    "a nonzero element @xmath3 is said to be a _",
    "geodesic vector _ if the corresponding left invariant vector field on @xmath2 is a geodesic vector field . in terms of the levi - civita connection @xmath4 , this means that @xmath5 .",
    "this has a simple equivalent expression in terms of the lie bracket @xcite , which we state as a definition .",
    "let @xmath0 be a lie algebra equipped with an inner product @xmath1 .",
    "then a nonzero element @xmath3 is a _",
    "geodesic vector _ if @xmath6 $ ] is perpendicular to @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "note that some authors use the term _ homogeneous geodesic _ , to distinguish them from general geodesics on the underlying lie group .",
    "some authors insist further that @xmath7 have unit length . for the more general case of totally geodesic subalgebras of lie algebras , see @xcite .",
    "[ r ] a useful equivalent reformulation of the definition of a geodesic vector is as follows : @xmath3 is geodesic if and only if @xmath9 is contained in the orthogonal complement of @xmath7 .",
    "every lie algebra possesses at least one geodesic vector @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that semisimple lie algebras possess an orthonormal basis comprised of geodesics vectors , for every inner product .",
    "results for certain solvable algebras are given in @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we examine the existence of geodesic bases in algebras of low dimension .",
    "first notice that if a lie algebra @xmath0 , equipped with an orthonormal inner product , has a basis @xmath10 of geodesic vectors , then for all @xmath11 , the element @xmath12 $ ] is orthogonal to both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the adjoint maps @xmath15 have zero trace , and hence @xmath0 is unimodular .",
    "so the natural problem is to determine which unimodular lie algebras possess an orthonormal basis comprised of geodesic vectors , for some inner product .",
    "we begin with two elementary observations .",
    "[ p1 ] let @xmath0 be a nilpotent lie algebra equipped with an inner product @xmath1 . then there is an orthonormal basis of @xmath16 comprised of geodesic vectors .",
    "the proof is by induction on the dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "the proposition is trivial when @xmath17 .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 . since @xmath0 is nilpotent , its centre is nonzero .",
    "let @xmath19 be a central element of length one and set @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the natural quotient map and give @xmath22 the inner product for which the restriction of @xmath23 to the orthogonal complement @xmath24 of @xmath25 is an isometry . by the inductive hypothesis",
    ", @xmath22 possesses an orthonormal basis @xmath26 comprised of geodesic vectors .",
    "so , by definition , for each pair @xmath11 , the element @xmath12 $ ] is perpendicular to both @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for each @xmath27 ,",
    "let @xmath28 denote the unique element of @xmath24 with @xmath29 .",
    "so for each pair @xmath11 , the element @xmath30 $ ] is perpendicular to both @xmath28 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , as @xmath19 is central , the elements @xmath28 are geodesic vectors . furthermore",
    ", as @xmath19 is central , @xmath19 is also geodesic .",
    "hence @xmath32 is an orthonormal basis of geodesic vectors .",
    "[ p2 ] let @xmath0 be a unimodular lie algebra having a codimension one abelian ideal @xmath22 .",
    "then , for every inner product @xmath1 on @xmath0 , there is an orthonormal basis of @xmath16 comprised of geodesic vectors .",
    "we make use of the following linear algebra result .",
    "[ l ] suppose that @xmath33 is a real square matrix with zero trace .",
    "then there is an orthogonal matrix @xmath34 such that @xmath35 has zero diagonal .",
    "let @xmath8 be a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath36 is geodesic since @xmath22 contains the derived algebra @xmath37 of @xmath0 .",
    "choose an orthonormal basis for @xmath22 and let @xmath33 denote the matrix representation of the restriction @xmath38 to @xmath22 of the adjoint map @xmath39 . since @xmath0 is unimodular , the matrix @xmath33 has zero trace . by lemma [ l ]",
    ", there is an orthonormal basis @xmath40 for @xmath22 relative to which @xmath38 has zero diagonal .",
    "consequently for each @xmath27 , the element @xmath41 $ ] is perpendicular to @xmath42 .",
    "thus since @xmath22 is abelian , the elements @xmath42 are geodesic vectors . hence @xmath43 is a geodesic basis for @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that in dimension less than or equal to three , there are only 5 nonabelian unimodular real lie algebras ; see @xcite .",
    "milnor s classification @xcite proceeds by considering , for an orthonormal basis @xmath44 , the linear map @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 denotes the vector cross product .",
    "the matrix of @xmath47 relative to @xmath44 is symmetric and so its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis @xmath48 with , by construction , @xmath49&=\\lambda_1 y_1,\\\\ [ y_3,y_1]&=\\lambda_2 y_2,\\\\ [ y_1,y_2]&=\\lambda_3 y_3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for real coefficients @xmath50 .",
    "so the basis elements @xmath51 are geodesic vectors .    in dimension 4 , there are infinitely many isomorphism classes of unimodular real lie algebras ; see @xcite . instead of using the classification , we will argue directly .",
    "the following result resolves a question raised in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be as in the statement of the theorem .",
    "first observe that if @xmath0 is not solvable , then from levi s theorem and the classification of semisimple algebras @xcite , there is a lie algebra isomorphism @xmath52 where @xmath22 is a simple lie algebra of dimension three ; so @xmath22 is isomorphic to either @xmath53 or @xmath54 though we wo nt need this fact .",
    "let @xmath55 be a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath56 , the element @xmath57 is geodesic .",
    "note that @xmath57 can be written uniquely in the form @xmath58 , where @xmath19 is in the centre of @xmath0 and @xmath59 . as we discussed above",
    ", @xmath22 has an orthonormal basis @xmath48 of elements that are geodesic vectors of @xmath22 .",
    "then for each @xmath60 , @xmath61=[x , y_i]\\in \\operatorname{im}(\\operatorname{ad}(y_i)|_{\\mathfrak h } ) , \\ ] ] which is perpendicular to @xmath42 by remark [ r ] .",
    "hence @xmath42 is geodesic in @xmath0 and thus @xmath62 is an orthonormal basis of geodesic vectors .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath0 is solvable .",
    "consider the derived algebra @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "as @xmath0 is solvable , @xmath37 is nilpotent ( * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath64 , the algebra @xmath0 is abelian and the theorem holds trivially .",
    "we consider three cases according to the remaining possibilities for the dimension of @xmath37 .    if @xmath65 , let @xmath66 .",
    "for each @xmath67 we have @xmath6\\in \\mathfrak g ' $ ] for all @xmath3 and hence @xmath68=\\operatorname{tr}(\\operatorname{ad}(x))w=0 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath37 is contained in the centre of @xmath0 .",
    "consequently @xmath0 is nilpotent , and the theorem holds by proposition [ p1 ] .    if @xmath69 , then either @xmath37 is abelian or @xmath37 is isomorphic to the heisenberg lie algebra @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath37 is abelian , the required result follows from proposition [ p2 ] .",
    "so suppose that @xmath37 is isomorphic to the heisenberg lie algebra .",
    "choose an orthonormal basis @xmath71 of @xmath37 with @xmath19 in the centre of @xmath37 and @xmath6=\\lambda z$ ] for some @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath55 be a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath57 is geodesic .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the matrix representation of the restriction @xmath73 to @xmath37 of the adjoint map @xmath74 . since the centre of @xmath37 is a characteristic ideal ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1.3 ) , it is left invariant by @xmath74 .",
    "hence @xmath33 has the form @xmath75 for reals @xmath76 . by the jacobi identity , @xmath77+[x,\\operatorname{ad}(w)y]=\\operatorname{ad}(w)\\lambda z = g\\lambda z.\\ ] ] thus @xmath78+[x , bx+dy+fz]=(a+d)\\lambda z = g\\lambda",
    "z,\\ ] ] and so @xmath79 . since @xmath74 has zero trace , @xmath80 , and hence @xmath81 .",
    "so , by lemma [ l ] , we can make an orthonormal change of basis for the space @xmath82 so that relative to the new basis , @xmath83",
    ". then @xmath84 is an orthonormal geodesic basis for @xmath0 .    finally , if @xmath85 , then @xmath37 is abelian .",
    "let @xmath86 be an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement @xmath87 to @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath6\\in\\mathfrak g ' $ ] and so as @xmath37 is abelian , the adjoint map @xmath88)$ ] acts trivially on @xmath37 .",
    "thus , since @xmath89)$ ] by the jacobi identity , we have that the restrictions @xmath90 and @xmath91 commute .",
    "since @xmath90 and @xmath91 have zero trace , relative to any choice of orthonormal basis for @xmath37 , they have matrix representations in @xmath92 .",
    "however , it is well known and easy to see that the maximum abelian subalgebras of @xmath92 have dimension one . consequently , by orthonormal change of basis for @xmath87 if necessary",
    ", we may assume that @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath94 is a codimension one abelian ideal and the result follows from proposition [ p2 ] .",
    "note that in propositions [ p1 ] , [ p2 ] and theorem [ t ] , the required orthonormal geodesic basis is obtained for _ every _ inner product .",
    "the following example gives a solvable unimodular lie algebra that has no orthonormal geodesic basis for _ any _ inner product .",
    "[ e ] consider the 5-dimensional algebra @xmath0 with basis @xmath95 and relations @xmath96 = 3x_2   & [ x_2,x_3 ] = x_4 \\\\    & [ x_1,x_3 ] = -4x_3 & [ x_2,x_4 ] = x_5 \\\\    & [ x_1,x_4 ] = -x_4   & \\\\    & [ x_1,x_5 ] = 2x_5 . &    \\end{array}\\ ] ] the ideal @xmath97 generated by @xmath98 is the ( unique ) 4 dimensional filiform nilpotent lie algebra .",
    "the adjoint map @xmath99 is obviously a lie derivation of @xmath97 , so the jacobi identities of @xmath0 hold .",
    "clearly , @xmath0 is solvable and unimodular , but not nilpotent .",
    "we will show that @xmath0 has no orthonormal basis comprised of geodesic vectors , for any inner product .",
    "equip @xmath0 with an inner product and suppose it has a basis ( not necessarily orthonormal ) of geodesic elements @xmath100 .",
    "consider an arbitrary geodesic vector @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 .",
    "relative to the basis @xmath103 , the matrix representation of @xmath104 is @xmath105 a priori , there are five cases :      in fact , case is impossible as otherwise @xmath7 is a nonzero multiple of @xmath116 but @xmath117 , which must be orthogonal to @xmath7 by remark [ r ] . similarly , case is impossible as otherwise @xmath118 but @xmath119 , which has to be orthogonal to @xmath7 by remark [ r ] .        in case , @xmath123 , which is the orthogonal complement of @xmath7 by remark [ r ] .",
    "it follows that , up to a constant multiple , there is at most one geodesic vector @xmath7 with @xmath124 .",
    "thus , there is at most one basis element , @xmath125 say , with @xmath126 .",
    "now suppose the @xmath42 are orthogonal .",
    "if two of the @xmath42 are in @xmath129 , they would both be orthogonal to @xmath122 .",
    "this would force the remaining two @xmath42 to be in @xmath122 , which we have seen is impossible .",
    "so only one of the @xmath42 , say @xmath130 , can be in @xmath129 .",
    "so @xmath131 are in @xmath132 .",
    "note that @xmath133 is left invariant by @xmath99 .",
    "relative to the orthonormal basis @xmath134 for @xmath133 , the map @xmath135 has zero diagonal , because the elements @xmath131 are geodesic vectors .",
    "so @xmath136 has zero trace . but",
    "relative to the basis @xmath137 , it is clear that @xmath136 has trace @xmath138 .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "although the algebra of the above example does not posses an orthonormal basis of geodesic vectors , it does posses an inner product for which there is a ( nonorthonormal ) basis of geodesic vectors .",
    "that is , we claim that there exists an inner product such that the span of all the geodesic vectors is the whole algebra . using the above notation ,",
    "regardless of the choice of an inner product , there is exactly one geodesic vector @xmath125 ( up to scaling ) not lying in @xmath139 , namely any nonzero vector from @xmath140 .",
    "we therefore want to show that the span of all the geodesic vectors from @xmath37 covers @xmath37 .",
    "we will now specify the inner product .",
    "first choose @xmath141 to be orthonormal and orthogonal to @xmath122 .",
    "then from case  , a vector @xmath142 ( with @xmath143 ) is geodesic if it is orthogonal to @xmath122 ( so @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 .",
    "this gives two linearly independent geodesic vectors @xmath146 , neither of which lies in @xmath133 .",
    "it remains to show that there exist at least two geodesic vectors in @xmath133 whose projections to @xmath122 are linearly independent .",
    "define the remaining components of the inner product by requiring that @xmath147 and @xmath148 . then by case  , a vector @xmath149 ( with @xmath150 ) is geodesic if and only if the following two conditions hold .",
    "@xmath151 note that @xmath152 , as otherwise from   either @xmath153 or @xmath154 and in both cases we obtain @xmath144 and then would give @xmath155 , which is a contradiction . solving   for @xmath156 and substituting to",
    "we get @xmath157 note that as @xmath158 and @xmath152 , ( [ eq:2 ] ) gives @xmath159 . dividing by @xmath160 and taking @xmath161",
    "we obtain @xmath162 the polynomial on the left - hand side has at least one positive root @xmath163 and at least one negative root @xmath164 .",
    "it follows that @xmath133 contains at least two geodesic vectors @xmath165 ( where @xmath166 are determined by  ) .",
    "their projections to @xmath122 are linearly independent , hence @xmath167 .",
    "note that for an arbitrary inner product on this algebra , the geodesic vectors may not span the entire algebra .",
    "for example , choosing an inner product with all the @xmath13 s orthogonal we obtain that the span of all the geodesic vectors is the proper subspace @xmath168 of @xmath0 .",
