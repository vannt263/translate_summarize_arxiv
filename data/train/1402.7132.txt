    "fractal geometries provide a description for many forms in nature such as coastlines , trees , blood vessels , fluid flow in porous media , burning wavefronts , dielectric breakdown , diffusion - limited - aggregation ( dla ) clusters , bacterial colonies , colloidal aggregates , etc .",
    "they exhibit self - similar and scale - invariant properties at all levels of magnification and are characterized by a non - integer fractal dimension .",
    "these features arise because the underlying processes have an element of stochasticity in them .",
    "such processes play an important role in shaping the final morphology , and their origin is distinctive in each physical setting .",
    "irregular and rough aggregates have also been observed in the astronomical context .",
    "naturally found cosmic dust aggregates , known as interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) , are collected in earth s lower stratosphere .",
    "they are formed when dust grains collide in a turbulent circumstellar dust cloud such as the solar nebula , and are an important constituent of the interstellar medium , interplanetary medium , cometary comae and tails , etc .",
    "mass spectroscopy analysis of idps have revealed that their primary constituents are ( i ) silicates of fe , mg , al and ca , ( ii ) complex organic molecules of c , h , o and n , ( iii ) small carbonaceous particles of graphite , coal and amorphous carbon and ( iv ) ices of co@xmath1 , h@xmath1o and nh@xmath2 @xcite . amongst these",
    ", there is an exclusive abundance of silicates which aggregate to form particle _ cores_.",
    "they have been described as _ fluffy , loosely - structured particles with high porosity_. the other constituents contribute to the outer covering or the _ mantle _ and are usually contiguous due to flash heating from solar flares and atmospheric entry @xcite .",
    "the core , being deep inside retains its morphology .",
    "the latter is believed to have a fractal organization characterized by a fractal dimension , but this belief is not on firm grounds as yet @xcite . as the core morphology affects the physical and optical characteristics of idps , its understanding has been the focus of several recent works @xcite .",
    "two classes of stochastic fractals are found in nature .",
    "the first class is that of _ surface fractals _ whose mass @xmath3 scales with the radius of gyration @xmath4 in a euclidean fashion , i.e. , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dimensionality .",
    "however , the surface area @xmath7 increases with the radius as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the surface fractal dimension and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "interfaces generated in fluid flows , burning wavefronts , dielectric breakdown and deposition processes are examples of surface fractals .",
    "the second class is that of _ mass fractals _ which obey the scaling relationship , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass fractal dimension and @xmath13 .",
    "examples of mass fractals are dla clusters , bacterial colonies and colloidal agregates .",
    "further , in many situations , mass fractals are bounded by surface fractals @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the above mass fractals belong to this class .",
    "there are many unanswered questions in the context of fluffy cores or silicate aggregates of idps .",
    "for example , are they mass fractals , bounded by surface fractals ?",
    "what is their mass and surface fractal dimension ?",
    "what kind of aggregation mechanisms are responsible for this morphology ?",
    "what are the consequences of fractal organization on the evolution of clusters ? in this paper , we provide answers to some of these questions using the _ real - space correlation function _ @xmath14 and the _ momentum - space structure factor _ @xmath15 .",
    "smooth morphologies are characterized by the _ porod law _ @xcite .",
    "the _ signature _ of fractal domains and interfaces is a _ power - law decay _ with non - integer exponents in @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as typical experimental morphologies are smooth on some length scales and fractal on others ,",
    "the behaviors of @xmath14 vs. @xmath16 and @xmath15 vs. @xmath17 are characterized by _ cross - overs _ from one form to another .",
    "we identify these features in laboratory analogs of cores of idps created by volten et al . using magnesio - silica grains , by reinterpreting their light - scattering data @xcite .",
    "we find that these aggregates are mass fractals with a fractal dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the same fractal dimension characterizes diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) .",
    "we therefore infer that aggregation mechanisms of silicate cores in idps are stochastic and irreversible as in dla .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section2 ]",
    ", we describe the tools for morphology characterization and their usage to obtain mass and surface fractal dimensions . in section  [ section3 ]",
    ", we describe the experimental analogs of silicate cores in idps and obtain the structure factor from their light scattering data to extract fractal properties . in section  [ section4 ] , we present a simulation of the dla cluster , and the evaluation of its structure factor and the corresponding mass fractal dimension .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results in section  [ section5 ] .",
    "a standard tool to obtain information about sizes and textures of domains and interfaces is the two - point spatial correlation function @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an appropriate order parameter and @xmath20 .",
    "( we assume the system to be translationally invariant and isotropic . )",
    "the angular brackets denote an ensemble average .",
    "the scattering of a plane wave by a rough morphology can yield useful information about the texture of the domains and interfaces in it .",
    "thus , small - angle scattering experiments ( using x - rays , neutrons , etc . ) can be used to probe their nature .",
    "the intensity of the scattered wave in these experiments yields the momentum - space structure factor , which is the fourier transform of the correlation function @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wave - vector of the scattered beam .",
    "the properties of @xmath23 and @xmath15 provide deep insights into the nature of the scattering morphology .    consider a domain of size @xmath24 formed by spherical particles of size @xmath25 , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "the typical interfacial width @xmath26 , is also indicated .",
    "this prototypical morphology could represent a colloidal aggregate , soot particles , a dla cluster , etc .",
    "the correlation function for such a morphology can be approximated by @xmath27 the first term conveys information about the domain texture probed by length scales @xmath28 . if the domain has no internal structure , @xmath29 = 1 signifying porod decay @xcite .",
    "for a fractal domain , on the other hand , @xmath29 = @xmath30 where @xmath12 is the mass fractal dimension @xcite .",
    "the second term conveys information about the properties of the interface , probed by lengths @xmath31 . for fractal interfaces , @xmath32 , and @xmath33",
    "is related to the fractal dimension as @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the third term is significant only if the building blocks are particles of diameter @xmath25 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath35 for @xmath36 , yielding a porod regime at a microscopic length scale .    in fourier space ,",
    "( [ corrf ] ) translates into the following power - law behavior of the structure factor : @xmath37 the porod decay of the form @xmath38 in the scattered intensity is typical of smooth domains or sharp interfaces @xcite .",
    "a deviation from this behavior to @xmath39 is indicative of a fractal structure in the domains or interfaces . when physical structures have multiple length - scales , one or more terms in eqs .",
    "( [ corrf ] ) and ( [ sf ] ) may contribute .",
    "their presence is characterized by cusps in the correlation function , and corresponding power - laws in the structure factor @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the power laws and cross - overs discussed above in the context of the 2-@xmath6 morphology depicted in fig .",
    "it should be noted that both the domain and the interfacial boundary in this schematic are rough , self - similar fractals . the structure factor @xmath15 vs. @xmath17 for this morphology obtained from the fourier transform of the spherically - averaged correlation function @xmath14 vs. @xmath16",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "1(b ) on a log - log scale .",
    "this function exhibits two distinct regimes over large and small values of @xmath17 as seen from the best fit lines : _ power - law decay _ with @xmath40 for @xmath41 and a _ porod decay _ with @xmath42 for @xmath43 . with reference to eqs .",
    "( [ corrf ] ) and ( [ sf ] ) , the power law decay signifies a fractal domain morphology with a mass fractal dimension @xmath44 while the porod decay is due to the smooth surface of the particles .",
    "the structure factor corresponding to wave vectors in the interval @xmath45 is due to scattering from the rough fractal interfaces .",
    "however it difficult to identify the corresponding power law with precision due to cross - overs effects from the adjoining mass fractal and porod regimes .",
    "we now investigate the morphological characteristics of silicate cores using the correlation function and the structure factor . as real samples are scarce , it has been customary to create them in the laboratory using a condensation flow apparatus followed by flash heating to mimic the environment required for the formation of cosmic silicates and circumstellar dust . a significant contribution in this context",
    "is the work of volten et al .",
    "they created a variety of magnesio - silica samples with ( relative ) concentrations typical of silicate cores in idps @xcite . the mixed grains in these samples formed interconnected , tangled chains ranging from open structures to dense structures , thereby yielding samples of varied porosities .",
    "we calculate @xmath15 for two such analogs : sample 1 has an equal proportion of mg and si ; and sample 2 has mg and si in the ratio 1.4:1 .",
    "these samples have a porosity of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "[ f2](a ) reproduces a prototypical tem image of an ultra - thin section sliced through mgsio particles prepared by volten et al .",
    "( the image is reproduced from @xcite with permission from the authors . )",
    "they are organized in the form of small fluffy aggregates organized in a contiguous but porous morphology @xcite volten et al . then obtained light - scattering data for the samples using the amsterdam light scattering database .",
    "the light - scattering properties were measured at a wavelength of 632.8 nm with the range of scattering angles from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , in steps of @xmath49 .",
    "these measurements yielded the scattering matrix elements as a function of scattering angle @xmath50 .",

    "( [ corrf])-([sf ] ) and the accompanying discussion , it is clear that the fluffy aggregates of samples 1 and 2 are mass fractals with a mass fractal dimension @xmath0 .",
    "a relevant question now is : what kind of mass - transport mechanisms lead to fluffy aggregates with @xmath0 ? to answer this question , we create aggregates of particles using the dla model .",
    "we performed this simulation on a cubic lattice adopting the algorithm introduced by meakin @xcite : ( i ) a particle is placed at the origin or the center of the cube .",
    "( ii ) a new particle is released at a distance @xmath4 from the center and performs a random walk .",
    "( iii ) on encountering an occupied neighboring site , it adheres irreversibly to it . steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) are repeated several times to obtain a dla cluster .    to mimic the morphology ( of several small aggregates )",
    "observed in the tem micrograph of fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) , we simulate a dla cluster ( @xmath55 ) using multiple seeds .",
    "each seed initiates a sub - cluster using the above procedure .",
    "we allow the sub - clusters to grow till they form a contiguous , yet delicately branched , self - similar structure .",
    "3(a ) depicts such a prototypical multi - seed cluster built from @xmath56 particles .",
    "we also show a slice of this morphology ( @xmath57 ) in fig .",
    "it contains two initial seeds , marked in red .",

    "( [ sf ] ) and the discussion thereafter , dla clusters are mass fractals with @xmath0 . in view of these observations , we infer that the aggregates obtained in the experiments of volten et al . with @xmath0",

    "this analysis has provided us a means to quantify characteristics such as the size and texture of these aggregates .",
    "the presence of fractal architecture is characterized by power laws with non - integer exponents in the structure factor .",
    "we found that the silicate aggregates are mass fractals with a fractal dimension @xmath0 .",
    "this value of @xmath59 is the same as the fractal dimension of aggregates obtained in a diffusion limited aggregation model .",
    "we therefore conclude that the aggregates are formed by an irreversible aggregation of stochastically transported silicate particles .",
    "we have also studied the effect of density of particles on the fractal dimension .",
    "our observation is that @xmath12 approaches the euclidian dimension ( @xmath60 ) with increasing density .",
    "further , we wish to emphasize that @xmath58 and @xmath53 contain information averaged over _ all _ domains and interfaces in contrast to the conventionally used ( local ) box - counting procedures .",
    "our estimates of @xmath12 are therefore very accurate .    for confirmation of our results and further insights ,",
    "we require data from real cosmic dust and cometary particles .",
    "we understand that it is difficult to obtain light scattering data from stellar objects .",
    "alternatively , information providing depth profiles of these assemblies could also be used to evaluate the @xmath58 and @xmath53 .",
    "as discussed above , they are excellent tools for morphology characterization especially due to their direct experimental relevance . more generally , micro - scale phenomena are characterized by mass - dependent diffusion , i.e. , the diffusion rate @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mass or number of particles in the cluster and @xmath29 is a system - specific parameter @xcite .",
