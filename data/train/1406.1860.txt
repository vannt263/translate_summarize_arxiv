    "<S> for example it was used by mott  @xcite in order to establish the presence of sharp mobility edges between localized and extended wavefunctions in disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> specifically it was argued that a degeneracy between a localized and an extended state would be fragile to any small perturbation which can convert the former into the latter . </S>",

    "<S> these , so - called , bound states in the continuum ( bic ) are typically fragile to small perturbations which couples them to resonant states and the associated potential that supports them is usually complicated . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , they can provide a pathway to confine various forms of waves like light  @xcite , acoustic , water waves  @xcite , and quantum  @xcite waves as much as to manipulate nonlinear phenomena in photonic devices for applications to biosensing and impurity detection  @xcite .    although most of the studies on the formation of bic states have been limited to hermitian systems there are , nevertheless , some investigations that address the same question in the framework of non - hermitian wave mechanics  @xcite . along the same lines </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of defect modes in the framework of @xmath0-symmetric optics  @xcite has recently attracted some attention . </S>",
    "<S> though the resulting defect states either are not bic states as they emerge in the broken phase where the eigenfrequencies are complex ( and thus the modes are non - stationary )  @xcite or when they appear in the exact phase , and thus correspond to real frequencies , the resulting potential is complex and its realization is experimentally challenging  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a previously unnoticed class of critical states which are embedded in the continuum ( csc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate their existence using a simple set - up consisting of @xmath1 coupled optical waveguides with one non- hermitian ( with loss or gain ) defective waveguide in the middle . similarly to bic they have real propagation constant ; albeit their envelop resembles a fractal structure . </S>",

    "<S> the localization -delocalization transition point is accompanied with a mode re - organization in the complex frequency plane which reveals many similarities with the dicke super / sub radiance transition . </S>",
    "<S> finally we can turn these exponentially localized modes to bic modes by adding a uniform loss ( for gain defect ) or gain ( for lossy defect ) in the array , thus realizing bic states in a simple non - hermitian set - up .    </S>",
    "<S> _ physical set - up - _ we consider a one - dimensional array of @xmath10 weakly coupled single - mode optical waveguides . the light propagation along the @xmath11-axis is described by the standard coupled mode equations  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the waveguide number , @xmath14 is the amplitude of the optical field envelope at distance @xmath11 in the @xmath15-th waveguide , @xmath8 is the coupling constant between nearby waveguides and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the optical wavelength in vacuum . </S>",

    "<S> .    _ mode segregation and dicke super - radiance - _ we begin by analyzing the parametric evolution of @xmath25 s as a function of the non - hermiticity parameter @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> note that although in the latter case the mode is localized in space , it is not qualified as a bic since the corresponding propagation constant @xmath37 ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq5 ] ) ) is imaginary and therefore the mode is non - stationary . adding , however , a uniform gain ( for lossy defect ) @xmath37 or loss ( for gain defect ) @xmath75 to the array </S>",
    "<S> can turn this state to a bic with zero imaginary propagation constant . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case is experimentally more tractable since adding a global loss will lead to a decay of all other modes while the localized defect mode would be stable having a constant amplitude .    . </S>",
    "<S> left panels report the left part ( @xmath76 ) of these modes ( the right part @xmath77 is the same ) by employing the scaling @xmath78 while the right panels report the right part @xmath77 of these modes without any scaling . in the former representation an extended state </S>",
