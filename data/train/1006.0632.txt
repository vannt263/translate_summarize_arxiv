    "cluster algebras were introduced by fomin and zelevinsky @xcite .",
    "they naturally appear in several different areas of mathematics , for example , in geometry of surfaces , in coordinate rings of algebraic varieties related to lie groups , in the representation theory of algebras , and also in the representation theory of quantum groups , etc .",
    "see @xcite , to name a few .    the simplest and the most tractable class of cluster algebras are the cluster algebras with finitely many seeds .",
    "they are called the _ cluster algebras of finite type _ and play a fundamental role in many applications .",
    "fomin and zelevinsky classified the cluster algebras of finite type by the dynkin diagrams in their pioneering works @xcite .",
    "they also clarified the intimate relation between cluster algebras of finite type and root systems of finite type .",
    "in particular , a remarkable periodicity property of mutations of seeds was discovered and proved ; it is related to the coxeter elements of the weyl groups @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on two kinds of periodicities of mutations in general cluster algebras .",
    "the first one is the periodicity of _ exchange matrices ( or quivers ) _ under a sequence of mutations .",
    "in other words , the _ exchange relations _ of clusters and coefficient tuples are periodic under such a sequence of mutations .",
    "the second one is the periodicity of _ seeds _ under a sequence of mutations .",
    "the latter periodicity implies the former one , but the converse is not true .",
    "let us briefly explain the background for this study .",
    "many examples of such periodicities appeared in connection with systems of algebraic relations called _ t - systems and y - systems _ @xcite and the _ dilogarithm identities _",
    "@xcite which originated in the study of integrable models in two dimensions .",
    "in retrospect , they are part of the cluster algebraic structure which appeared prior to the notion of cluster algebra itself . naturally and inevitably , their cluster algebraic nature has been gradually revealed recently @xcite , and it turned out that the cluster algebraic formulation and machinery are very powerful and essential to understanding their properties .",
    "since examples of periodicities of exchange relations and seeds are accumulating , it may be a good time to reverse the viewpoint , namely , to formulate t - systems , y - systems , and dilogarithm identities in a more general and unified setting , starting from general cluster algebras with such periodicity properties .",
    "this is the subject of the paper .",
    "let us summarize the main result of the paper .",
    "for any sequence of mutations under which exchange matrices are periodic , we define the associated t- and y - systems .",
    "when the sequence is ` regular ' , they are particularly natural generalizations of the known ` classic ' t- and y - systems .",
    "the definition of the term ` regular ' is found in definition [ def : regular ] .",
    "furthermore , for any sequence of mutations under which seeds are periodic , we formulate the associated dilogarithm identity . we prove the identities when exchange matrices are skew symmetric .",
    "we expect that there will be several applications of the result in various areas related to cluster algebras .",
    "we mention that many examples of periodicities of exchange matrices were constructed by fordy and marsh @xcite and the associated t - systems were also introduced .    the relation between cluster algebras and the dilogarithm was also studied earlier by fock and goncharov @xcite . in fact , proposition [ prop : local ] is motivated by their formulas .",
    "however , there is a subtle but important difference ; that is , we use _ @xmath0-polynomials _ of @xcite in .",
    "see section [ subsec : local ] for more details .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the basic notions for periodicities of exchange matrices and seeds . in section 3",
    "we present some of known examples of periodicities of exchange matrices ( or quivers ) and seeds , most of which are connected to ` classic ' t- and y - systems . in section 4",
    "we give restriction / extension theorem of periodicities of seeds .",
    "after these preparations , in section 5 , for any sequence of mutations under which exchange matrices are periodic , we define the associated t- and y - systems . here",
    "we do not require the periodicity of seeds .",
    "special attention is paid to the case when the sequence is regular . in section 6 , for any sequence of mutations under which seeds are periodic ,",
    "we formulate the associated dilogarithm identity .",
    "then , we prove the identities when exchange matrices are skew symmetric in theorem [ thm : di ] , which is the main theorem of the paper .",
