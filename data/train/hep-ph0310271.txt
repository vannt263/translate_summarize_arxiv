    "threshold resummations  @xcite have been an active field of study in qcd for over two decades .",
    "they have a direct relevance to phenomenology  @xcite , since they extend the range of applicability of perturbative methods for the computation of hard cross sections , but they are also interesting from a purely theoretical point of view , since they provide a method to probe the interface of perturbative and nonperturbative physics .",
    "the central issue which is addressed by threshold resummations is the physics of inhibited radiation . at high energy , in a production process which forces the radiation of gauge bosons in the final state to be either soft or collinear to the hard partons carrying the bulk of the invariant mass , the validity of the perturbative expansion is jeopardized by the presence of large double ( sudakov ) logarithms to all orders .",
    "the logarithms are the remainders of soft and collinear singularities , after the cancellations required by the mandatory infrared safety of the observable ; they are large , because such a process has two disparate scales : the hard scale @xmath1 and the scale of soft radiation @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) ; they can be exponentiated and resummed , thanks to the factorizability and universality properties of soft and collinear radiation .",
    "to account for the constraint imposed by momentum conservation , the exponentiation of soft contributions takes place after a mellin ( or laplace ) transform with respect to the variable vanishing at threshold , @xmath4 . in terms of the mellin variable @xmath0 , conjugate to @xmath4 ,",
    "one finds a hierarchy of contributions , with an increasingly mild behavior at large @xmath0 , corresponding to a decreasing level of infrared sensitivity at small @xmath4 .",
    "sudakov logarithms are the only terms growing with @xmath0 , as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "then one finds terms independent of @xmath0 , then terms suppressed by powers of @xmath0 , which however may still have logarithmic behavior in @xmath0 , such as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "most of the work done in the past on the subject of threshold resummations has focused on sudakov logarithms , which have been shown to exponentiate to all logarithmic accuracies , and are currently being explicitly evaluated at nnl level  @xcite .",
    "it was clear from the beginning  @xcite , however , that at least some of the @xmath0-independent terms arising in the relatively simple case of the drell - yan process were both numerically important and exponentiating together with the logarithms .",
    "furthermore , at least a subset of the logarithmic terms suppressed by a power of @xmath0 can also be resummed by similar techniques , and it has been shown that these terms have a considerable impact on cross sections of phenomenological interest  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of both practical and theoretical interest to study the possibility of extending currently available resummation techniques beyond the case of sudakov logs . here",
    ", we will briefly discuss the exponentiation of @xmath0-independent terms in the relatively simple cases of the dis structure function @xmath9 and of the drell - yan cross section , following @xcite .",
    "the resummation of threshold logarithms can be derived by factorizing the relevant cross section to isolate soft and collinear enhancements . for the partonic drell - yan cross section this factorization takes the form  @xcite [ om ] ( n , ) = |h_|^2 ( n , ) ^2 u(n )",
    "+ o(1/n ) , where @xmath10 is a parton distribution containing singular collinear contributions , while @xmath11 is an eikonal cross section responsible for coherent soft radiation .",
    "the dis structure function @xmath9 obeys a similar factorization [ f2 ] f_2 ( n , ) = |h_|^2 ( n , ) v(n ) j(n ) + o(1/n ) , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 play the same role as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , while @xmath16 is a jet function summarizing the effect of collinear final state radiation .    these factorizations are valid up to corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath0 , and thus they include @xmath0-independent terms .",
    "the key observation is that it is possible to separate , within each function , real emission diagrams from purely virtual contributions , and then to express all virtual ( an thus @xmath0-independent ) functions in terms of the quark form factor .",
    "specifically one finds that ( n , ) & = & |(q^2,)|^2 _ r(n , ) ^2 u_r(n , ) + o(1/n )  , [ arifac1 ] + f_2 ( n , ) & = & |(- q^2 , ) |^2 _ r(n , ) v_r(n , ) j_r(n , ) + o(1/n ) . [ arifac2 ] each factor in eqs .  ( [ arifac1 ] ) and ( [ arifac2 ] ) is now a pure exponential : for real emission contributions this was established in ref .",
    "@xcite , while for the form factor in dimensional regularization it was proven in ref .  @xcite .",
    "taking the ratio of ( [ arifac1 ] ) and ( [ arifac2 ] ) one finds an exponentiated expression for the factorized dis - scheme drell - yan cross section , valid up to corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath0 , which can be organized in the form [ findis ] & & _ ( n ) = | |^2  .",
    "explicit expressions for the various functions involved are listed in  @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to generalize this result to the scheme .",
    "the mellin transform of the quark distribution , @xmath17 , can , in fact , be written in exponential form , up to corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath0 .",
    "further , as shown in  @xcite , it is possible to factorize real and virtual contributions to @xmath17 , so that virtual poles precisely cancel those arising from the quark form factor .",
    "the factorized -scheme drell - yan cross section can then be written as the product of two finite exponential factors , one associated with real gluon emission , and one with purely virtual graphs .",
    "the final result can be organized in the form & & _ ( n ) = | |^2 ( ) ^2  .",
    "[ finms ] again , explicit expressions for the functions involved are given in ref .",
    "( [ findis ] ) and ( [ finms ] ) are our main results : they generalize currently available resummations for the drell - yan partonic cross section to include the exponentiation of all @xmath0-independent terms .",
    "clearly , the same reasoning and a similar formula apply for the partonic dis structure function @xmath9 factorized in the scheme .",
    "it should be clear that the exponentiation of @xmath0-independent terms does not have the same predictive power as the resummation of sudakov logarithms .",
    "in fact , for example , a one - loop calculation suffices to determine exactly the coefficients of the leading sudakov logs to all orders , whereas constant terms , although exponentiating , receive nontrivial contributions order by order .",
    "the resummation formulas in eqs .",
    "( [ findis ] ) and ( [ finms ] ) can however be used in practice in at least two different ways .",
    "first of all , for the purpose of analytic calculations , on can make use of the fact that all functions appearing in the factorizations ( [ om ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) have precise operator definitions , as well as of the fact that in the resummations ( [ findis ] ) and ( [ finms ] ) real and virtual contributions are separately finite .",
    "these two facts provide alternative , and often simpler , methods to perform and test analytic calculations at the resummed level , without having to compute the full cross section at the relevant perturbative order . as an example , in ref .",
    "@xcite we were able to compute the second order perturbative coefficient of the function @xmath18 , using only information arising from virtual graphs , and reproducing the result previously obtained  @xcite by matching to the exact two - loop cross section .    from the point of view of phenomenology ,",
    "although exponentiation of the one - loop result does not suffice to determine exactly any specific perturbative coefficient at higher orders , it remains true that a nontrivial subset of higher order corrections originate from exponentiation .",
    "this subset provides a well - founded estimate of the uncertainty of the perturbative calculation due to unknown higher order corrections . to test this fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimated the numerical values of @xmath0-independent terms at two loops , by using only one - loop information in the exponent , together with renormalization group running .",
    "we find that exponentiation predicts three quarters of the exact answer for these terms in the dis scheme , whereas for the scheme the prediction exceeds the exact value by about @xmath19 . in both cases , we conclude that exponentiation gives a fairly reliable estimate of the complete calculation .",
    "we conclude by noting that these results may be seen as a first step towards further generalizations of soft gluon resummation : first of all , it would be interesting to study the exponentiation of @xmath0-independent terms for more general qcd cross sections , in the presence of nontrivial color exchange ; furthermore , a precise formulation of the exponentiation of sudakov logarithms suppressed by a power of @xmath0 would be of considerable phenomenological interest .",
