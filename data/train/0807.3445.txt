    "0.5 cm it is remarkable that different data sets of complementary nature such as supernovae , baryon oscillations , galaxy clustering , microwave back ground and weak lensing all taken together strongly support the late time acceleration of universe . in the standard lore , one assumes that the history of universe is described by the general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the late time acceleration can easily be captured in this frame work by introducing a scalar field with large negative pressure known as _ dark energy _ @xcite . in view of the fine tuning problem ,",
    "the scalar field models , specially those with tracker like solutions , are more attractive compared to the models based on cosmological constant . at present , observations are not in a position to reject or to establish the dark energy metamorphosis . a host of scalar field models have been investigated in the literature .",
    "the scalar field models can fit the data but lack the predictive power .",
    "it then becomes important to seek the support of these models from a fundamental theory of high energy physics .",
    "0.5 cm one can question the standard lore on fundamental grounds .",
    "we know that gravity is modified at small distance scales ; it is quite possible that it is modified at large scales too where it has never been confronted with observations directly .",
    "it is therefore perfectly legitimate to investigate the possibility of late time acceleration due to modification of einstein - hilbert action .",
    "it is tempting to study the string curvature corrections to einstein gravity amongst which the gauss - bonnet correction enjoys special status .",
    "a large number of papers are devoted to the cosmological implications of string curvature corrected gravity@xcite .",
    "these models suffer from several problems .",
    "most of these models do not include tracker like solution and those which do are heavily constrained by the thermal history of universe .",
    "for instance , the gauss - bonnet theory with dynamical dilaton might cause transition from matter scaling regime to late time acceleration allowing to alleviate the fine tuning and coincidence problems . however , it is difficult to reconcile this model with nucleosynthesis@xcite .",
    "another possibility of large scale modification is provided by non - locally corrected gravity which typically involves inverse of dalembertian of ricci scalar .",
    "the non - local construct might mimic dark energy ; the model poses technical difficulties and there has been a little progress in this direction@xcite .",
    "the large scale modification may also arise in extra dimensional theories like dgp model which contains self accelerating brane .",
    "apart from the theoretical problems , this model is heavily constrained by observation",

    "the @xmath0 gravity theories giving rise to cosmological constant in low curvature regime are plagued with instabilities and on observational grounds they are not distinguished from cosmological constant .",
    "the recently introduced models of @xmath0 gravity by hu - sawicki and starobinsky ( referred as hss models hereafter ) with disappearing cosmological constant@xcite have given rise to new hopes for a viable cosmological model within the framework of modified gravity ( @xmath0 gravity model with similar properties is proposed in ref.@xcite ) .",

    "these models reduce to cosmological constant .",
    "both the first and the second derivatives of @xmath0 with respect to r are positive . the positivity of the first derivative ensures that the scalar degree of freedom , a characteristic of any f(r ) theory , is not tachyonic where as the positivity of second derivative tells us that graviton is not ghost thereby guaranteing the stability . in starobinsky parametrization@xcite ,",
