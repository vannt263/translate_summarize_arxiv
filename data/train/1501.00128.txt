    "the impact of the precision parameter @xmath21 in this definition is addressed by the _ cutoff phenomenon_a concept going back to the pioneering works  @xcite  roughly saying the choice of any fixed @xmath21 does not change the asymptotics of @xmath14 as the system size goes to infinity . formally , a family of ergodic finite markov chains @xmath13 , indexed by an implicit parameter @xmath22 , exhibits _ cutoff _",
    "iff @xmath23 for any fixed @xmath24 . the _ cutoff window _ addresses the correction terms : a sequence @xmath25 is a cutoff window if @xmath26 for any @xmath15 with an implicit constant that may depend on @xmath21 .",
    "that is , the markov chain exhibits a sharp transition in its convergence to equilibrium , whereby its distance drops abruptly ( along the cutoff window ) from near 1 to near 0",
    ".    establishing cutoff can be highly challenging ( see the survey  @xcite ) , even for simple random walk with a uniform stationary measure : e.g. , it is conjectured that on _ every _ transitive expander graph the random walk exhibits cutoff , yet there is not a single example of a transitive expander where cutoff was confirmed ( even without transitivity , there were no examples of expanders with cutoff before  @xcite ) .",
    "as for glauber dynamics for the ising model , where our understanding of @xmath11 is far more limited , until recently cutoff was confirmed only in a few cases , with first results on lattices appearing in the works  @xcite .    the methods used to analyze the dynamics for the ising model on @xmath1 in those works had several caveats : the reliance on delicate features such as log - sobolev inequalities did not cover the full high temperature regime in dimensions @xmath27 , and did not give a correct bound on the cutoff window ; furthermore , the argument immediately broke on any geometry with exponential ball growth ( expanders ) .",
    "recently , in  @xcite and its companion paper  @xcite , we introduced a new framework called _ information percolation _",
    ", which does not have these limitations and can hopefully be used to analyze a wide range of stochastic spin systems .",
    "we demonstrated its application in analyzing the stochastic ising model on @xmath1 up to @xmath28 , and to compare the effects of different starting configurations on mixing ",
    "e.g . , showing that an initial state of i.i.d .  spins mixes about twice faster than the all - plus starting state ( which is essentially the worst one ) , while almost every starting state is as bad as the worst one .",
    "here we demonstrate a simpler application of the method for the ising model on a fixed - degree transitive graph at very high temperatures , establishing cutoff within an @xmath0-window around @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the magnetization at the origin at time @xmath31 ( in which @xmath32 denotes the dynamics started from all - plus ) .",
    "that is , @xmath33 is the time at which the expected sum - of - spins drops to a square - root of the volume , where intuitively it is absorbed within the normal fluctuations of the ising measure .",
    "[ mainthm - trans ] for any @xmath34 there exists @xmath35 such that the following holds .",
    "let @xmath2 be a transitive graph on @xmath22 vertices .",
    "for any fixed @xmath15 , continuous - time glauber dynamics for the ising model on @xmath2 at inverse - temperature @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , the dynamics on a sequence of such graphs has cutoff with an @xmath0-window around @xmath33 .",
    "in this section we define and classify the information percolation clusters in their most basic form ( commenting how this setup may be altered in more delicate situations such as @xmath10 close to @xmath28 on @xmath1 ) , then reduce the proof of theorem  [ mainthm - trans ] to estimating the probability that a cluster is `` red '' .",
    "the dynamics can be viewed as a deterministic function of @xmath38 and a random `` update sequence '' of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the update times ( the ringing of the poisson clocks ) , the @xmath41 s are i.i.d .  uniformly chosen sites ( whose clocks ring ) , and the @xmath42 s are i.i.d .  unit variables ( random coin tosses ) . according to this representation ,",
    "one processes the updates sequentially : set @xmath43 ; the configuration @xmath44 for all @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is obtained by updating the site @xmath41 via the unit variable as follows : letting @xmath47 denote the current sum - of - spins at the neighbors of @xmath41 , if the coin toss satisfies @xmath48 then the new spin at @xmath41 is chosen to be plus and otherwise it is set to minus .",
    "equivalently , one may evaluate this deterministic function backward in time rather than forward : sort the same update sequence @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a designated time at which we wish to analyze the distribution @xmath52 ( and argue it is either close or far from equilibrium ) . to construct @xmath52",
    ", we again process the updates sequentially , now setting @xmath53 and determining @xmath44 for all @xmath54 in step @xmath55 , where the value of the spins at the neighbors of @xmath41 ( determining @xmath56 and the probability of @xmath57 in the update as above ) is evaluated recursively via the suffix of the update sequence .    examining",
    ", this backward simulation of the dynamics can be made more efficient , since even if all the neighbors of the site that is being updated are ( say ) minus , there is still a positive probability of @xmath58 for a plus update : we may therefore decide to first examine @xmath42 , and if @xmath59 for @xmath60 we will set the new spin to plus / minus as a fair coin toss irrespective of @xmath56 ( namely , to plus iff @xmath61 ) ; otherwise , we will recursively compute the spins at the neighbors of @xmath41 , and set the new spin to plus iff @xmath62 ( the right - hand is @xmath63 for the extreme @xmath64 , while for other values of @xmath56 the rule depends on @xmath42 . )    we have arrived at a branching process in the space - time slab : to recover @xmath65 we track its lineage backward in time , beginning with the temporal edge in the space - time slab @xmath66 $ ] between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the time of the latest update to @xmath70 . if no such update was encountered and this `` branch '' has survived to time @xmath71 , it assumes the value of the initial configuration @xmath72 .",
    "alternatively , an update at time @xmath69 has two possible consequences : if it features @xmath73an _ oblivious update_the branch is terminated as the spin can be recovered via a fair coin toss using @xmath42 ; otherwise , we branch out to the neighbors of @xmath70 , adding spatial edges between @xmath74 and @xmath75 for all @xmath76 , and continue developing the update histories of each of them until the process dies out or reaches time 0 .",
    "this produces a graph in the space - time slab which we denote by @xmath77 , and let @xmath78 be its intersection with the slab @xmath79 ( viewed as a subset of @xmath3 ) ; further let @xmath80 and set @xmath81 analogously .",
    "the _ information percolation _",
    "clusters are the connected components of the graph consisting of @xmath82 .    by definition",
    ", @xmath83 is a deterministic function of the @xmath42 s corresponding to points in @xmath84 and of @xmath85 , the initial values at the intersection of @xmath84 with the slab @xmath86 ; in particular , if @xmath87 then @xmath52 is independent of @xmath38 , and therefore its law is precisely the ising distribution @xmath11 ( for instance , in that scenario we could have taken @xmath88 and then @xmath89 by the invariance of @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , we note that waiting for a time @xmath51 large enough such that @xmath82 would be guaranteed not to survive to time @xmath71 with high probability is an overkill ; the correct mixing time is the point at which @xmath90 , whence the effect of @xmath38 on @xmath52 would be absorbed in the normal fluctuations of @xmath11 .",
    "the above defined rule for developing the update histories either terminated a lineage or branched it to its @xmath91 neighbors . in different applications of the method , it is crucial to appropriately select other rules with the correct marginal of the heat - bath dynamics .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite we prove results _  la _ theorem  [ mainthm - trans ] on any graph ( including , e.g. , expanders ) and any @xmath92 for an absolute constant @xmath93the correct dependence on @xmath91 up to the value of @xmath94by selecting @xmath95 with probability @xmath96 and then deciding the new spin via a function of a uniformly chosen @xmath97-element subset of the neighbors , with the probabilities @xmath96 ( and the corresponding functions to be applied ) following from a discrete fourier expansion of the original glauber dynamics update rule .",
    "furthermore , in  @xcite , to analyze @xmath1 arbitrarily close to @xmath28 , instead of describing such a rule explicitly one relies on the _ existence _ of an efficient rule thanks to the exponential decay of spin - spin correlations .",
    "in the ising model on @xmath98 , with probability @xmath99 we assign a uniform @xmath57 spin , and with probability @xmath100 we expose @xmath101 and select the consensus spin in case @xmath102 or a uniform @xmath57 spin in case @xmath103 . hence , an equivalent rule would be to terminate the branch with probability @xmath99 and otherwise to select a uniform neighbor and copy its spin , so @xmath77 is merely a continuous - time simple random walk killed at rate @xmath99 , and @xmath82 consists of @xmath22 coalescing random walks killed at rate @xmath99 .",
    "the probability that @xmath104 ( survival from time @xmath51 to time @xmath71 ) is then @xmath105 , and we would have @xmath106 at @xmath107 , which is exactly the cutoff location .",
    "the key to the analysis is to classify the information percolation clusters to three types , where one of these classes will be revealed ( conditioned on ) , and the other two will represent competing factors , which balance exactly at the correct point of mixing . in the basic case ,",
    "the classification is as follows :    a cluster @xmath108 is red  if , given the update sequence , its final state @xmath83 is a nontrivial function of the initial configuration @xmath38 ( in particular , it survives to time @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath109 ) .",
    "a cluster @xmath108 is blue  if @xmath110 is a singleton ( @xmath111 for some @xmath112 ) and its history does not survive to time zero ( in particular , @xmath83 does not depend on @xmath38 ) .",
    "every other cluster @xmath113 is green .",
    "let @xmath114 be the set of all vertices whose histories belong to red clusters , and let @xmath115 be their collective history ( similarly for blue / green ) . by a slight abuse of notation , we write @xmath116 to denote that @xmath117 ( similarly for blue / green ) , yet notice the distinction between @xmath116 and @xmath118 ( the former means that @xmath84 is a full red cluster , rather than covered by ones ) .",
    "various other classifications to red / green / blue can be used so that red  captures the entire dependence on the initial configuration and blue  forms a product - measure .",
    "for instance , in order to study the effect of initial conditions in  @xcite we let a cluster be red if at least two branches of it survive to time @xmath71 and _ coalesce upon continuing to develop their history _ along @xmath119",
    "$ ] ; and in order to carry the analysis of  @xcite up to @xmath28 , the classification is more delicate , and involves the histories along a burn - in phase near time @xmath51 which allows one to amplify the subcritical nature of the clusters .    note that if @xmath120 then , by definition and symmetry , the distribution of @xmath65 is uniform @xmath57 . on the other hand , while the spins of a green cluster @xmath113 are also independent of @xmath38 , its spin - set at time @xmath51 can have a highly nontrivial distributions due to the dependencies between the intersecting update histories .",
    "it is these green clusters that embody the complicated structure of the ising measure .    in the ising model on @xmath98 ,",
    "as explained above , an information percolation cluster corresponds to a maximal collection of random walks that coalesced .",
    "a cluster is red if it survived to time @xmath121 ( the rule of copying the spin at the location of the walk guarantees a nontrivial dependency on @xmath38 ) ; it is blue if the random walk started at @xmath70 dies out before coalescing with any other walk and before reaching time @xmath71 ; and it is green otherwise . observe that the sites of a green cluster at time @xmath51 all have the same spin  a uniform @xmath57 spin , independent of @xmath38and the probability of @xmath122 belonging to the same green cluster decays exponentially in @xmath123 ( as the walks become more likely to die out than merge ) .    as the green clusters demonstrate the features of the ising measure",
    ", it is tempting to analyze them in order to understand @xmath52 .",
    "the approach we will follow does the opposite : we will _ condition on the entire set of histories @xmath124 _ ( or @xmath125 for brevity ) , and study the remaining ( red and blue ) clusters .    as we hinted at when saying above that if @xmath87 then @xmath126 , the ising measure @xmath11 can be perfectly simulated via developing the histories backwards in time until every branch terminates without any special exception at time @xmath71 .",
    "( this would be equivalent to taking @xmath51 larger and larger until @xmath82 would be guaranteed not to survive , essentially as in the ingenious _ coupling from the past _ method of perfect simulation due to propp and wilson  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we can couple @xmath52 to @xmath11 via the same update sequence , in which case the distribution of @xmath127albeit complicated  is identical ( green clusters never reach @xmath71 ) , allowing us to only consider blue / red clusters ( however in a difficult conditional space where percolation clusters are forbidden from touching various parts of the space - time slab ) .",
    "the second key is to keep the blue clusters  which could have been coupled to @xmath11 just like the green ones , as they too do not survive to time @xmath71in order to water down the effect of the red clusters ( which , by themselves , are starkly differently under @xmath52 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "we will show that , conditioned on @xmath125 , the measures @xmath11 and @xmath52 are both very close to the uniform measure ( and therefore to each other ) , i.e. , essentially as if there were no red clusters at all and every @xmath128 belonged to @xmath129 .",
    "indeed , conditioning on the green clusters replaces the ising measure by a contest between blue and red clusters : at large @xmath51 , the effect of red  is negligible and we get roughly the uniform measure ; at small @xmath51 , the effect of red  dominates and @xmath38 will have a noticeable affect on @xmath52 ; the balancing point @xmath33 has the red  clusters make an effect on @xmath52 , but just within the normal fluctuations of @xmath11",
    ".    showing that the effect of the red clusters is negligible just beyond the cutoff location will be achieved via a clever lemma of miller and peres  @xcite that bounds the @xmath130-distance of a measure from the uniform measure in terms of a certain exponential moment . in our setting , this reduces the problem to showing : @xmath131 \\approx 1\\quad\\mbox { in probability as } n\\to\\infty\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are independent instances of the vertices whose histories are part of red clusters .",

    "( the actual calculation of the exponential moment given @xmath125 , especially at very low temperatures , requires quite a bit more care . )",
    "the key to obtaining the bound on the exponential moment in  , which is the crux of the proof , is estimating a conditional probability that @xmath116 , in which we condition not only on @xmath125 but on the entire collective histories of every vertex outside of @xmath110 , and that @xmath110 itself is either the full intersection of a red cluster with the top slab @xmath143 or a collection of blue singletons .",

    "for intuition , recall that @xmath116 if the histories @xmath154 are all connected and @xmath83 is a nontrivial function of @xmath38 ( in particular , @xmath109 ) . this is closely related to the probability that for a single @xmath155 we have that @xmath65 is a nontrivial function of @xmath38 ( i.e. , @xmath77 survives to time @xmath71 and creates a nontrivial dependence on @xmath38 , whence the connected component of @xmath67 is a red cluster ) .",
