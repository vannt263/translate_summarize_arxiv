    "the top quark is the heaviest particle of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "therefore , the top quark properties , and their production process provide a possibility for probing new physics beyond the sm .",
    "furthermore , the impacts of new physics on the top quark couplings are considered to be larger than that on any other fermions , and conflicts with the sm expectations could be measured as described in @xcite .",
    "a search for rare decays of the top quark is one of such studies .",
    "the search for the top quark anomalous interactions via flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) is of special interest . for the top quark",
    ", fcnc decays @xmath11 ( @xmath1 ) can not be seen at the tree level of the sm .",
    "these decays can only make loop contributions . as a result , the branching ratios of @xmath11 are very small , and they are at the order of @xmath12 @xcite . however , various extensions of the sm , such as the quark - singlet model @xcite , the two - higgs doublet model @xcite , the minimal supersymmetric model @xcite , supersymmetry @xcite , the top - color - assisted technicolor model @xcite or extra dimension model @xcite could lead to a huge enrichment of those kind of decays .",
    "the cdf collaboration bounds on the branching ratios at @xmath10 c. l. for the process @xmath11 as follows @xcite    @xmath13    furthermore , the zeus collaboration obtained upper limits at @xmath10 c.l . on the anomalous @xmath0 couplings @xmath14 @xcite . the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "can produce a large number of top quarks .",
    "therefore , top quark interactions can be examined with high sensitivity . in particular , atlas collaboration has predicted a sensitivity of @xmath15 at @xmath16 level @xcite .",
    "the fcnc effective lagrangian among the top quark , two quarks @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the photon @xmath19 can be written as @xcite    @xmath20    here @xmath21 is the anomalous coupling for the neutral currents with a photon ; @xmath22 is a new physics scale ; @xmath23/2 $ ] ; @xmath24 is the electromagnetic coupling constant ; @xmath25 is the electric charge of the top quark .",
    "@xmath22 is the conventionally taken mass of the top quark ( @xmath26 ) for the sake of definiteness .",
    "hence , we take @xmath27 . also , we assume in our calculations @xmath28 . using the anomalous interaction given in eq.[lag ] ,",
    "the decay width can be obtained as follows ,    @xmath29    where we put the masses of the u and c quarks equal to the zero .",
    "branching ratio of the anomalous @xmath11 decay can be given by the following equation , since the main decay mode of the top quark is @xmath30    @xmath31    using this equation , from the experimental constraints of the cdf collaboration it is easy to obtain magnitude of the upper limit on @xmath32 .",
    "in this work , we have examined anomalous fcnc interactions for the process @xmath33 at the lhc .",
    "we show a schematic diagram for the this reaction in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the subprocess of the main reaction is @xmath34 .",
    "this process is becoming interesting as an additional way to investigate for sm or new physics .",
    "in many situations , ultraperipheral collisions and elastic interactions can not be detected at the central detectors .",
    "forward detectors are developed by the atlas and cms collaborations to detect the scattering particles which can not be caught by the central detectors with limited pseudorapidity .",
    "these extra detectors are placed at distance of @xmath35 m - @xmath36 m from the central detectors .",
    "usual @xmath37 deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) incoming protons dissociate into partons .",
    "therefore , dis interactions have very sophisticated backgrounds . in the dis process , made up of jets from the proton remnants , some ambiguities are created which make it hard to detect the new physics signals beyond the sm .",
    "however , @xmath38 or @xmath39 interactions have a clean environment compared to the usual proton - proton dis , since in @xmath38 or @xmath39 collisions with almost real photons , a photon is emitted , while the proton remains intact .",
    "because of both of the incoming protons remaining intact , @xmath38 collisions provide fewer backgrounds compared to the other processes .",
    "however , @xmath39 collisions have higher energy and effective luminosity with respect to @xmath38 interactions .    in @xmath39 collisions , the almost real photons with low virtuality",
    "are emitted from only one of the proton beams and it is a good approximation to assume that they are on - mass - shell . because of the low virtuality of the photons , the structure of the photon emitting protons are not spoilt",
    "also , almost real photons are scattered with small angles , and then they have a low transverse momentum .",
    "since these photons have very high energy , they can interact with quarks in the other incoming proton s internal structure . on the other hand , intact protons which are emitting photons deflect slightly their path along the beam pipe , and , generally , they can not be detected in central detectors .",
    "one of the main properties of forward detectors is to detect the intact protons with some momentum fraction loss given the formula , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are momentums of incoming protons and intact scattered protons , respectively . at very high energies ,",
    "it is a good approximation to write @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the energies of the proton emitting the photon and of the photon , respectively .",
    "if the forward detectors are established closer to central detectors , a higher @xmath45 can be obtained .",
    "forward detectors can detect intact outgoing protons in the interval @xmath46 .",
    "this interval is known as the acceptance of the forward detectors .",
    "atlas forward detectors have an acceptance of @xmath47 @xcite and cms - totem forward detectors are placed closer to the central detectors and the acceptances span @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "photon - induced reactions in hadron collider phenomena were recently observed in the measurements of the cdf collaboration @xcite , and these measurements are consistent in both theoretical expectations with @xmath50 through two photon exchange ( @xmath51 ) . therefore , the photon - induced interactions potential at the lhc is significant , with its high energetic pp collisions , and high luminosity @xcite .",
    "moreover , two photon reactions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 have been measured by the cms collaboration from the early lhc data at @xmath55 tev @xcite .",
    "the photon - induced reactions in @xmath37 collisions can be obtained in the framework of the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite . in this approximation the equivalent photon spectrum , given the virtuality @xmath56 and the energy of the quasi - real photons @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , is given as follows :    @xmath59 \\label{phs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the incoming proton energy ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the remaining terms are as follows ,    @xmath61    here , @xmath62 is the mass of the proton , @xmath63 is the squared magnetic moment of the proton , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are functions of the electric and magnetic form factors , respectively , and @xmath44 are the energies of the proton emitting the photon and of the photon , respectively .",
    "the cross section for the main process @xmath66 can be found by integrating @xmath67 subprocess cross section over the photon and quark spectra :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the momentum fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the quark .",
    "@xmath70 is the quark distribution function of the proton .",
    "also , we have taken the @xmath71 gev@xmath72 since @xmath73 greater than @xmath74 gev@xmath72 does not make a significant contribution to this integral . from eq.[efflum ] the following equation can be obtained ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is total mass of the final state particles of the @xmath77 subprocess and , @xmath78 with @xmath79 . in our paper , we have used martin , stirling , thorne and watt parton distribution functions @xcite . during calculations ,",
    "we have taken the quark virtuality @xmath80 .",
    "in all the results presented in this work , we impose a cut of pseudorapidity @xmath81 for final state particles from subprocess @xmath77 since central detectors of the atlas and cms have a pseudorapidity @xmath82 coverage of @xmath83 .",
    "the subprocess @xmath77 consists of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath17 channel tree - level sm diagrams .",
    "additionally , there is a one tree - level feynman diagram containing anomalous @xmath0 coupling in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the total polarization summed amplitude squared are given in appendix .",
    "in our calculations , it is assumed that the center of mass energy of the lhc is @xmath86 tev .",
    "the total cross sections as a function of @xmath87 for four acceptance regions @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath88 are presented in fig .",
    "we see from this figure that total cross sections for the @xmath3 and @xmath89 are close to each other . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have plotted the sm and total cross sections of @xmath90 as functions of the transverse momentum cut ( @xmath91 cut or @xmath92 ) of the final state particles for @xmath93 and two forward detectors acceptance regions : @xmath3 and @xmath6 . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] same as fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] but for the other acceptances regions : @xmath4 and @xmath88 .",
    "as seen from these figures , in actual experiments both angular distribution and the @xmath91 cut can be used to improve the sensitivity bounds since contributions of the new physics and the sm are well separated from each other for high @xmath91 cut regions . moreover",
    ", the acceptance region @xmath6 has almost the same features as the other acceptance regions with a high @xmath91 cut .",
    "it can be concluded that a high lower bound of the acceptance region mimics an extra @xmath91 cut .",
    "therefore , in this paper we estimate sensitivity of the @xmath66 process to be @xmath0 anomalous couplings using two different statistical analysis methods .",
    "first , we use a poisson distribution , which is the appropriate sensitivity analysis since the number of sm events with these cuts are small enough . in this statistical analysis ,",
    "the number of observed events are assumed to be equal to the sm prediction @xmath94 .",
    "here s is the survival probability factor , e is the jet reconstruction efficiency and l is the integrated luminosity .",
    "we have taken a survival probability factor of @xmath95 @xcite , and the @xmath96 jet reconstruction efficiency of @xmath97 .",
    "we consider w boson decay leptonically , hence here br is the branching ratio of w boson to leptons . in the second statistical analysis",
    "we have used the @xmath98 criterion without a systematic error which is given by    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the total cross section including @xmath101 and new physics and @xmath102 is the statistical error .",
    "we show the sensitivity of the 95% c.l .",
    "parameter @xmath87 as a function of integrated lhc luminosity for @xmath103 and @xmath49 in fig .",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath103 , @xmath4 in fig.@xmath105 .",
    "we set @xmath106 gev and @xmath81 in these figures .    during calculations we considered all tree - level sm contributions for the subprocess @xmath77 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "these generate major backgrounds . on the other hand ,",
    "the leading order background to this process might be coming from the pomeron - quark interaction .",
    "a pomeron emitted from one of the incoming proton beam can collide with the other proton s quarks and same final state particles can take place .",
    "however , when examined in detail it can been seen that this background process is expected to have a quite small influence on limits of the anomalous coupling . in dis process",
    "the virtuality of the struck quark is quite high . in this work ,",
    "we take the the virtuality of the struck quark @xmath107 . hence , when a pomeron collides with a quark it may be dissociate into partons .",
    "pomeron remnants can be caught by the calorimeters and this background can be removed .",
    "morever , the survival probability for a pomeron exchange is quite smaller than the survival probability of induced photons .",
    "hence , even if the background from pomeron exchange can not be eliminated , it does not affect the bounds on anomalous coupling @xcite .    in low luminosity values",
    "the pile - up of events is negligible in @xmath39 interactions at the lhc .",
    "however , these backgrounds can be suppressed by using exclusivity conditions , kinematics and timing constraints at high luminosity @xcite . for these purposes",
    ", we give the sensitivity bounds for between luminosity values of @xmath108 fb@xmath109 in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "as seen from these figures , sm backgrounds could be smaller than @xmath110 depending on the integrated luminosity .",
    "therefore , in these kinematical regions we have used poisson analysis for the @xmath111 and , we have used @xmath98 criterion for @xmath112 .",
    "we understand from the figures that the best sensitivity has been obtained in the @xmath103 case . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the 95% c.l .",
    "lower bounds for @xmath87 as a function of integrated lhc luminosity for @xmath103 , @xmath49 and @xmath113 gev . fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] same as fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] but for @xmath4 and @xmath88 . in this high @xmath91 cut region ,",
    "sm events smaller than @xmath110 for all of the luminosity values as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "hence , in figs . [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] we use only poisson analysis .",
    "these figures show that the obtained sensitivity bounds in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] are better than in figs.[fig8 ] and [ fig9 ]",
    ". however , high @xmath91 cut regions have a very clean environment .",
    "therefore , any signal which conflicts with the sm expectations would be a credible clue for there being something beyond the sm .",
    "by using very forward detectors , the lhc can be designed as a high energy photon - photon and photon - proton collider .",
    "there is no existing high energy photon - photon , photon - proton collider with this property .",
    "the process @xmath114 provides fewer backgrounds than the pure dis process due to one of the incoming protons being intact after the collision .",
    "the detection of the intact protons in forward detectors make it possible to determine the momentum of the quasi - real photons",
    ". this situation may be useful in determining the kinematics of the process .",
    "moreover , anomalous @xmath0 couplings might also be uniquely revealed in single top photoproduction @xcite .    in these motivations , we have analysed the potential of the @xmath114 at the lhc to probe anomalous @xmath0 couplings for four forward detector acceptances @xmath3 , @xmath89 , @xmath5 and , @xmath49 .",
    "we determined that this photon - induced process has an important potential to examine anomalous @xmath0 couplings .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity bounds for @xmath106 gev and @xmath113 gev regions .",
    "the sensitivity bounds on @xmath0 coupling are better than the current experimental results even at luminosity value of @xmath115 fb@xmath109 . for this luminosity value",
    ", bounds on @xmath0 coupling can be improved @xmath116 times with respect to present experimental datas as seen from fig.[fig6 ] .    on the other hand , we show that obtained results improve the sensitivity bounds by up to a factor of @xmath117 for @xmath3 with respect to current experimental data as seen from fig .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath113 gev , the results improve the sensitivity bounds on @xmath0 couplings by up to a factor of @xmath118 for @xmath3",
    ". these high @xmath91 cut regions can give extra opportunities to search for new physics with very low backgrounds . as a result ,",
    "forward detectors provide an enhancement of the physics studied at the lhc .",
    "the total polarization summed amplitude squared which consists of sm , new physics and interference parts has been obtained in functions of the mandelstam invariants @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 as follows ,                      where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the electromagnetic and weak coupling constants , @xmath133 is the @xmath96 quark mass and @xmath134 is the w boson mass .",
