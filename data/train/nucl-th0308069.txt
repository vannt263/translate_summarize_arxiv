    "when a proton is knocked out off a nucleus in quasi - elastic inclusive ( @xmath3 ) and exclusive ( @xmath4 ) processes at high values of the momentum transfer @xmath5 , the final state interaction ( fsi ) can be described within the eikonal glauber approach .",
    "recently such an approach to fsi has been extended so as to take into account the virtuality of the hit nucleon after @xmath6 absorption @xcite .",
    "it has been found that because of the fft the hit proton needs to reach its asymptotic state , the fsi with the spectator @xmath7 nucleons becomes very weak and vanishes in the asymptotic limit .",
    "although the physical process underlying the vanishing of the fsi at large @xmath5 is the same which appears in colour transparency phenomena , quantitative effects may largely depend upon the details of the underlying theoretical model to treat fsi . in this contribution some results of a systematic calculation of fsi and fft effects in the inclusive and exclusive processes off few - nucleon systems will be presented .",
    "the central quantity in our calculations is the effective nucleon distorted momentum distributions @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the missing momentum and the momentum of the detected proton , respectively , and @xmath11 the distorted overlap between the ground state wave functions of nuclei @xmath12 and @xmath13 , _ viz _ @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the sets of jacobi coordinates for nuclei @xmath12 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "if fft effects are considered at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the bjorken scaling variable ) , the glauber operator @xmath19 appearing in @xmath20 can be replaced by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 the nucleon mass , and @xmath23 the average virtuality defined by @xmath24 .",
    "[ eq : fft ] shows that at high values of @xmath5 fft effects reduce the glauber - type fsi , depending on the value of @xmath23 . at @xmath25 ( the so called _ cumulative _ region ) , eq .",
    "[ eq : fft ] does not hold and a simple prescription to deal with fft effects can not be given .",
    "some results of our calculations , performed with realistic wave functions corresponding to the rsc and av18 interactions , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "it should be stressed that when calculations are performed in the relatively low @xmath5 kinematics of the recent tjlab experiments @xcite , a good agreement with preliminary experimental data is observed .     including fsi ( dashed line ) and fsi+fft ( full line ) to the pwia cross section .",
    "the calculation corresponds to an initial electron energy @xmath26 and scattering angle @xmath27 .",

    "the results we have exhibited show that : i ) in inclusive and exclusive processes off @xmath0 , fft effects ( color transparency effects ) produce a non negligible contribution in the cumulative region ( @xmath25 ) already at moderately values of @xmath5 , whereas at @xmath29 they appear to contribute only at much higher values of @xmath5 ; ii ) the treatment of fsi effects within the glauber approach can properly describe exclusive processes off @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the kinematics of present jlab experiments ; iii ) the inclusion of fft in the process @xmath37he(e , ep)@xmath38h @xcite predicts a clean and regular @xmath5-dependence of fsi effects leading to their vanishing at moderately large values of @xmath5 ; such a prediction would be validated by the experimental observation of a dip in the cross section at @xmath39 . in ref .",
