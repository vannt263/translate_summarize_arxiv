    "the concept of compton telescope ( ct ) has proved the most successful so far in imaging astrophysical @xmath0-ray sources in the energy band 1 - 30  @xcite . in a classical ct , without electron tracking , the initial direction of the @xmath0-ray is determined to within a circle of angular radius @xmath1around the direction of the scattered @xmath0-ray , given by the spatial coordinates ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 ) , the subscripts 1 and 2 indicating the first and second interaction of the @xmath0-ray . the scatter angle @xmath1  is given by an energy measurement , through the compton formula for photons on free electrons @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy of the scattered @xmath0-ray , @xmath6 the initial energy of the @xmath0-ray , @xmath7 the mass of the electron ( 0.511  ) .",

    "the correct sequence of the two interactions must also be known .",
    "comptel @xcite on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) has been the most successful ct to date .",
    "comptel was a double - scatter ct with a liquid scintillator detector as @xmath0-ray converter and a nai calorimeter .",
    "the two detectors were separated by a distance of 1.5  m to allow a measurement of the scatter direction with an accuracy of few degrees . in laboratory calibration ,",
    "comptel obtained an effective area of @xmath1020  @xmath11 or less , out of a geometrical area of the upper detector of 4188  @xmath11 , therefore with an efficiency well below 1@xmath12 .",
    "the sequencing of compton interactions was based on the _ time of flight _ measurement between the upper and lower detector . in flight",
    "the lower energy threshold for compton imaging was 0.75  , determined by rate considerations .",

    "[ f : compton ] ) , specifically a liquid xenon time projection chamber ( lxetpc ) , in order to increase the efficiency and improve the background rejection capability well beyond the comptel achievement .",
    "the practical realization of this proposal has been the liquid xenon @xmath0-ray imaging telescope ( lxegrit ) @xcite .",
    "it has been tested at balloon altitude four times : twice in 1997 , mainly engineering balloon flights , in 1999 with a heavy @xmath0-ray shield and in 2000 with the un - shielded lxetpc .",
    "the year 2000-balloon flight , in particular , lasted 27 hours and provided a data sample large enough to address all the main technical issues , to give a thorough in - flight calibration and to study the background in the near space environment @xcite .",

    "energy and position are measured for each interaction , therefore providing ( @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath14 ) . as in a classical compton telescope , the scatter angle @xmath1",
    "is then determined from the compton formula ( eqn .  1 ) and the position of the @xmath0-ray source is constrained within a compton circle of angular radius @xmath1  around the direction of the scattered @xmath0-ray , as determined by the two points ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath15 ) . ]",
    "aim of this paper is to present a detailed study of the efficiency of lxegrit to  @xmath0-rays , based both on experimental data and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations",
    ". the focus will be on data taken just prior to the 2000 flight .",
    "the overall detection efficiency results from the combination of several contributions : detector geometry and passive materials , trigger efficiency , dead time and limited speed of the data acquisition system , on - line and off - line selections .",
    "these different contributions will be analyzed separately .",
    "lxegrit will be dealt with as an imaging calorimeter but we will stop short of discussing the key issue of imaging  @xmath0-ray sources , too vast a subject to be included in the present work ( see , e.g. , @xcite  ch .  4 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    * experimental measurements of the trigger efficiency , given in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ; * mc simulation of lxegrit , in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] ; * the full data / mc comparison , given in sec .",

    "the lxegrit tpc is a position sensitive liquid ionization chamber self - triggered by the fast xenon scintillation . when a @xmath0-ray interacts in the fiducial volume , both scintillation light and ionization charge are produced efficiently , with w - values of @xmath16 24  ev @xcite and @xmath17 = 15.6  ev @xcite .",
    "the vuv photons ( 178  nm ) are detected by four photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , which provide the event trigger and the initial time , t@xmath18 .",
    "the ionization electrons drift under an external electric field , inducing a signal on two parallel wire planes , screened by a fritsch grid .",
    "there are 62 wires in each plane and the pitch of the wires is 3  mm .",
    "the location of the hit wire(s ) in the two wire planes provide the @xmath19 and @xmath20 coordinates in the tpc reference frame , while the time , measured starting from t@xmath18 , gives the interaction depth ( @xmath21 coordinate ) .",
    "the wires do not collect the charge , which is finally collected by one of four independent anodes , and the amplitude measures the energy deposited in the interaction .",
    "once the event has been built by the data acquisition system ( daq ) , on - line selections are applied to the signals from the wires and the anodes . if not rejected , the _ raw event _ , i.e. anode and wire digitized waveforms ,",
    "is written to disk .",
    "a detailed description of the lxetpc and its working principle is given in @xcite ; a schematic diagram of the lxetpc showing the principle of operation , readout structure and expected pulse shapes is given in fig .  [ f : tpc_schematic ] .",
    "the event trigger works on two different levels : a _ first level trigger _ ( flt ) which requires a signal from the pmts and a _ second level trigger _ ( slt ) which performs further selections based on the anode / wire signature .",
    "the interconnections of the lxegrit trigger system and readout electronics are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ f : trigger_schematic ] .",
    "the flt is provided by the logical or of the four pmts ( electron tubes 9813qa ) .",
    "these 2-inch - diameter tubes , with a quantum efficiency of about 15@xmath12 at 178  nm , see the lxe volume through four 2.4 inch diameter quartz windows with good transparency in the uv ( 88% at normal incidence ) .",
    "the bottom of the fiducial volume and the quartz windows are separated by a 3  cm thick layer of lxe plus the collection region , about 1  cm thick .",
    "this large separation reduces the solid angle for events in the fiducial volume , and consequently the light yield .",
    "additional light losses are due to total reflection at the window / pmt interface . several photoelectrons are expected for every  of energy deposited in the fiducial volume @xcite .",
    "the flt , while allowing a fast ( @xmath10@xmath22s ) decision , is unable to select specific event categories of interest for compton imaging .",
    "the 1999 balloon flight @xcite clearly demonstrated that , when the energy spectrum of the incident @xmath0-rays is soft , as for the atmospheric @xmath0-ray background , described by power law with spectral index 2 , a high flt efficiency is equivalent to accept a dominant fraction of events at low energies which are of little if any use for a ct , eventually _ reducing _ the efficiency for compton imaging .",
    "for the 2000 flight , the light trigger efficiency was changed to minimize the shortcomings detected during the previous flight .",
    "the efficiency was measured and resolved versus energy and position , following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the collected data fall into three classes :    * events with an interaction detected in the fiducial volume ( charge signal ) and a light trigger which matches the external trigger  this class is the one contributing to the _ efficiency _ ; * events with an interaction detected in the fiducial volume and a light trigger which does not match the external trigger ( just a chance coincidence count )  this class introduces a _ background _ in the measurement , that has to be accounted for ; * events with an interaction detected in the fiducial volume and without a light trigger  this class gives the _",
    "inefficiency_.    the efficiency is measured as the number of events in _ class a _ divided by the total number of events subtracted _ class b_. the measurement described in @xcite used a @xmath23na  source , which emits three photons at the same time , one at 1.275  and two at 0.511  which are emitted back - to - back , so that one of the two 0.511  photons could be used to tag the source .",
    "the spatial correlation of the two photons allowed a low contamination due to chance - coincidences . while this allowed a detailed measurement of the spatial dependency of the trigger efficiency for the 1999 balloon flight settings , the energy range of that measurement",
    "was limited up to 0.511  , rather low for a detector designed to work up to 10  .",
    "a similar measurement was repeated for the 2000 settings using an @xmath24y  source , which emits simultaneously two photons at 0.898 and 1.836  with little angular correlation , and , separately , a @xmath23na  source .",
    "the sources were loosely tagged detecting one of the photons from the decay with a nai(tl ) counter . given a source rate of several khz and a low tagging efficiency , the level of contamination due to chance coincidence counts was high , and , combined with the low efficiency in the 2000 settings , more events ended up in _ class b _ rather than in _",
    "class a_. nonetheless , the fraction of events in _ class b _ is independently determined and the final result is then corrected for with good accuracy .",
    "in fact , the @xmath21 ( drift time ) distribution for events triggered by random coincidence has no physical meaning and extends above the nominal cathode position ( 7  cm ) , which delimitates the tpc active volume .",
    "this is visible in fig .",
    "[ f : lte.zpos ] where the @xmath21 distribution drops sharply at @xmath21  =  7  cm .",
    "the shape of the @xmath21 distribution for events in _ class b _ was determined through data where a random trigger was fed in as flt .",
    "it did show no appreciable dependence on @xmath21 , so that the fraction of background events was read out from the @xmath21 distribution itself .",
    "the efficiency of the flt is in this way measured for energies up to about 2  .",
    "the efficiency was resolved in a four dimensional data space  energy , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21  as made possible by the imaging capability of the tpc .",
    "since each event has to be spatially resolved and , at the same time , the four pmts see the total energy deposited in the fiducial volume , the analysis was limited to 1-site events , for which a univocal association between total energy loss and position is given .",
    "the efficiency in the 4d space was described factoring out the energy dependence , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a position dependent weighting factor .",
    "the dependence of the efficiency on the deposited energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : lte.energy ] for the four pmts combined , using data from both @xmath23na  and @xmath24y  sources .",
    "a pmt mostly detects interactions happening within its own quadrant and very few events are detected by more than one pmt at the same time , because of the strong solid angle effect on light collection .",
    "the response of each pmt is measured and parameterized individually and the energy dependence is described analytically . for use in montecarlo simulations ,",
    "the spatial dependence was parameterized in a lookup table with a granularity of 1.17  cm in @xmath21 and 1.8  cm in @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( 6 @xmath21 slices times 11@xmath2711 bins in the @xmath28 plane ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath21 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : lte.zpos ] for one pmt .",
    "as expected , the efficiency decreases with increasing distance from the pmt s location ( @xmath21  =  -4  cm ) .",

    "[ f : lte.energy ] ; selecting energy deposits larger than 1   the overall efficiency is greatly increased .",

    "[ f : lte.xy ] , as measured using a tagged @xmath24y  source , integrated over all energies .",
    "the four panels correspond to four different @xmath21 slices , going from the bottom of the fiducial volume ( _ upper - left _ ) to the top ( _ bottom - right _ ) , i.e. moving farther away from the pmts .",
    "the impact of solid angle is apparent , and closer to the pmts the overall efficiency is higher and less uniform . at locations corresponding to the four pmts below the wire structure",
    "an enhanced efficiency is clearly visible .",
    "the slt is provided by on - line selections based on the wire and anode signals :    * the event is built ( see sec .  [",
    "susec : daq ] ) and the number of threshold - crossings on the @xmath19 and @xmath20 wires ( _ wire hits _ ) is checked to be greater than a predefined minimum and less than a predefined maximum .",
    "this step requires little readout time , since each channel is 1  byte only .",
    "it is also sensitive to specific event multiplicities , relevant for a ct since compton imaging requires at least two interactions ; * the amplitude of the anode waveform is checked against a given threshold .",
    "imposing a threshold on the anode waveform is very effective in rejecting low energy events which are useless for a ct , but , for lxegrit electronics , it requires to readout the digitized waveforms and the slowness of this process greatly reduces the usefulness of this on - line selection .    the slt has proven to be a powerful tool , although critically dependent on the noise level of the wires , and requiring careful monitoring .",
    "the impact of the slt was verified for each experiment by applying _",
    "a posteriori _ the on - line selections to a sample of data acquired with full digitization of all wires .",
    "the outcome of one of these routine checks is shown in figs .",
    "[ f : minmax.1 ] , [ f : minmax.2 ] for data taken with an @xmath24y  source placed a few meters away from the tpc . the minimum number of wire hits required both in the @xmath19 and in the @xmath20 wire plane was 6 , the maximum 16 .",
    "each interaction usually gives 1 or 2 hits , depending on the energy deposit and the threshold of the specific wire .",
    "the maximum has no impact on @xmath0-events and mainly filters out relativistic charged particles crossing the chamber and giving many hits at the same time .",
    "ideally a minimum of 6 wire hits would select only events with 3 or more interactions , but in a situation with non - negligible electronic noise a certain fraction of 1-site events is accepted ( see fig .",
    "[ f : minmax.2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the fraction of accepted events depends on energy , since an interaction with large energy is more likely to be detected over noise . for events with multiplicity 3 or higher",
    "the slt efficiency is @xmath29 above 1  , where most of these events are .",
    "the main goal of this slt filter is therefore to reject low energy ( below 0.5  ) 1-site events , especially important when the @xmath0-ray flux has a soft spectrum .",
    "this simple procedure just counts the number of wire hits and does not exploit the 3d imaging capability of the tpc .",
    "when data are analyzed off - line , the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 coordinates are matched and the contamination due to noisy events is reduced to a truly negligible level @xcite .      the daq system developed for the 2000 flight of lxegrit is described in @xcite .",
    "the total throughput of the system is limited to about 1.6  mb / s , restricting the event building rate to 40 - 50 events / s when data are taken in a mode that reads all information from anodes and wires , providing a full image of the chamber ( in this case the event size is about 30  kb ) .",
    "the more usual data - taking mode transfers only wire waveforms which crossed preset thresholds together with the four anode waveforms and the maximum rate of built events increases to 200 - 400  hz , the actual value heavily depending on the selection parameters and the specific source . in flight conditions and for typical settings",
    "the average event size is @xmath105.5  kb .",
    "the deadtime behavior of the system is non - paralysable with respect to the daq , i.e. the rate at the trigger level @xmath30 and the recorded count rate @xmath31 are related as @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the deadtime of the system , @xmath103  ms in 2000 flight ; for @xmath34 , @xmath35  khz .",
    "the performance of the daq is usually the main limiting factor to the efficiency of lxegrit and imposes an upper limit to the maximum rate of useful events , i.e. events written to disk and made available for further analysis .",
    "once this upper limit is saturated , the final efficiency for compton imaging can be improved only by being more selective and enhancing the fraction of multi - site events in the final data sample . in comparison ,",
    "the tpc itself , given a maximum charge collection time of about 40  @xmath22s , is hardly dead - time limited in any realistic situation .",

    "taking into account a 5700  s exposure and solid angle , the 18.6@xmath2718.6  @xmath11 geometrical area of the tpc was hit by 1.08@xmath2710@xmath50 1.836  photons and 1.01@xmath2710@xmath50 0.898  photons .",
    "the daq livetime fraction was 50@xmath12 livetime and the efficiency in writing to disk was only 18@xmath12 , for only that fraction of the bandwidth of disk writing was used .",
    "this last efficiency is usually @xmath10100@xmath12 . correcting for these two inefficiencies , one",
    "is left with 9.7@xmath2710@xmath51 1.836  photons and 9.1@xmath2710@xmath51 0.898  photons .",
    "counting the events in the two fep gives the overall detection efficiency .",
    "this procedure introduces an uncertainty of about 5@xmath12 because of the necessary background subtraction .",
    "the results are :    * 0.898  : 0.39@xmath2710@xmath52 events , i.e. 0.43@xmath12 efficiency * 1.836  : 1.30@xmath2710@xmath52 events , i.e. 1.34@xmath12 efficiency    these small figures require some explanations . as discussed in sec .",

    "[ f : mult.4 ] gives an upper limit to the detection efficiency , including only the efficiency for containment and the inefficiency due to passive materials .",
    "it is about 18@xmath12 at 0.898  and 11@xmath12 at 1.836  .",
    "the light trigger efficiency alone reduces this detection efficiency by a factor of almost 9 at 0.898  and a factor of 3 at 1.836  .",
    "the slt further reduces the efficiency by a factor of 3 at 0.898  and a factor 1.7 at 1.836  ( fig .  [",
    "f : minmax.1 ] , from the same experiment ) .",
    "this decreases the efficiency to 0.6@xmath12 at 0.898  and 1.9@xmath12 at 1.836  .",
    "losses due to noisy wires , events with excessive baseline noise on the anodes , and other anomalous events identified and rejected in the off - line analysis , account for the missing part ( @xcite  ch .  3 , and @xcite ) .",
    "the efficiency differs for different multiplicities , mainly as a result of the slt , which is designed to enhance the fraction of multi - site events .",
    "inefficiencies due to daq livetime and disk writing are independent of the interaction multiplicity , and the flt efficiency has on average little dependence on the interaction multiplicity .",
    "there are various sources of uncertainty on the specific efficiencies , some of them systematically lowering the final figure :    * the overall _ measured _ efficiency is known quite precisely , the main uncertainty coming from the subtraction of the background beneath the line ( @xmath53% ) ; * the flt efficiency is known with 5@xmath12 precision for 1-site events , but assuming the same efficiency for higher multiplicities introduces a larger error .",
    "the 5@xmath12 precision is restored for multi - site events through a complete mc simulation , as in figs .",
    "[ f : ytdi - mc.1 ] , [ f : ytdi - mc.2 ] , [ f : ambe ] ; * for a typical data set , the slt efficiency is known within 5@xmath12 for all the multiplicities , statistics usually being the limiting factor ; * the efficiency of the off - line procedure to extract the signal is more easily evaluated for 1-site events . in this case",
    "the efficiency in finding a good signal is very close to 100@xmath12 for energies larger than few hundreds , and the 30@xmath12 inefficiency comes from the fraction of `` noisy '' events rejected off - line . for multi - site events the efficiency can be lower since , for instance , the chance of _ not _ hitting a noisy wire decreases with interaction multiplicity .",
    "* the precision of the mc expectation before flt and slt should be within 5@xmath12 once the assumed conditions are matched .",
    "many factors can systematically reduce the detection efficiency : noisy or dead wires , higher energy thresholds etc .",
    "again , these factors are more relevant for higher multiplicities .",
    "it is clear from comparing the overall _ expected _ efficiencies to the _ measured _ ones , as in fig .",
    "[ f : mult.4 ] ( where the measured efficiencies have been corrected for the estimated flt , slt and off - line efficiencies ) , that the expectation is optimistic but within reason , the discrepancy ranging between 15@xmath12 and 30@xmath12 ( roughly equivalent , for example , to the effect of 12 noisy wires out of 124 ) , for different energies and multiplicities . as a conclusion , it is easy at this point to extrapolate what the efficiency would be if the daq could handle a 10 times larger rate . with a light trigger efficiency as high as the one obtained in 1999 for the same detector ( 50% or higher at 0.511  , @xcite ) the final efficiency could be close to the one depicted in sec .",
    "[ susec : pa - ma - and - co ] .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the efficiency of the lxegrit instrument for detecting  @xmath0-rays .",
    "we have shown that the detector response is well understood in its various components and well reproduced through mc methods .",
    "the lxegrit daq clearly constitutes a severe bottleneck when dealing with sources which generate a relatively high trigger rate ( few khz ) , not an uncommon situation , given the size of the lxetpc . for the 2000 balloon flight in year 2000 , we chose to _ reduce _ the efficiency at the trigger level , to specifically select multiple compton events in the few-  region .",
    "the rationale of this choice was to to maximize the fraction of multiple compton events given that the maximum event rate was fixed by saturating the daq bandwidth .",
    "if not limited by the current daq , this same prototype could have achieved a detection efficiency as a calorimeter close to 20@xmath12 at 1  , which can be obtained in the current configuration only for sources generating a trigger rate lower than 100  hz .",
