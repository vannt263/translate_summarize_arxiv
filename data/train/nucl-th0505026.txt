    "more than 50 years ago hans bethe has remarked about the nature of nucleon - nucleon in his famous review `` what holds the nucleus together ? '' :   _ in the past quarter century physicists have devoted a huge amount of experimentation and mental labor to this problem  probably more man - hours than have been given to any other scientific question in the history of mankind _  \" . and this claim is still valid today . despite of the enormous efforts of many labs , groups and personal researchers over the world during the last 50 years and despite of the great progress in experiments and fundamental theory provided by developments in qcd , we are still not having in our disposal a consistent and reliable dynamical theory for the @xmath0-interaction at intermediate and especially at short distances , which can form a solid basis for the explanation of numerous precise experimental data in meson - production in @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,  collisions , in few - body physics and in many two - proton photo - emission nuclear experiments , like @xmath12 , @xmath13 etc .",
    ", at rather high momentum transfer .",
    "we enumerate here some of basic points where the conventional description of the short - range @xmath0-interaction in terms of meson exchanges ( e.g. @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 etc . )",
    "fails or looks to be quite inconsistent .",
    "first of all , the value of the @xmath16 coupling constant ( which is responsible for the short - range @xmath0 repulsion and the spin - orbit splitting ) accepted in all obe - models turns out to be in the range @xmath17 which is much larger than the respective su(3 ) value ( @xmath18 ) while all other coupling constants used in obe - models are in a good agreement with the respective su(3 ) predictions .",
    "another evident inconsistency is that almost all meson - exchange nucleon - nucleon models use a too high value for the tensor - to - vector @xmath4-meson coupling to the nucleon , @xmath19 . at the same time , an analysis of the data on @xmath20 scattering yields a much more modest value , @xmath21 for this parameter ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus the short - ranged central and tensor nucleon - nucleon forces in boson - exchange models are enhanced  by hand  to reproduce the experimental @xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "another fundamental difficulty in the traditional obe - approach , also tightly related to the short - range nucleon - nucleon interaction , are the very large values of cut - off parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,  in meson - baryon vertices , which are responsible for short - range limit of the @xmath0-interaction .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 etc . accepted in traditional obe - models ( @xmath26 gev )",
    "are at least three times larger than those derived from any dedicated experiments ( e.g. from @xmath20 scattering ) , or from all fundamental theories ( @xmath27 gev ) . moreover , the values of @xmath22 or @xmath25 necessary to fit the charged pion production in @xmath10-collision is strongly different from those values needed to fit the _ elastic _ @xmath10-scattering . and",
    "those both values are different from respective values which are adopted in @xmath28-force operator to fit the @xmath28 binding energy within @xmath29- and @xmath28-force models driven by one - boson exchange @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) the comparison between the most elaborated modern calculations for @xmath28-system ( both in bound state and continuum ) which include also the respective mec - contributions @xcite and the results of recent experiments at nikhef on @xmath35 reaction .",
    "it is clearly seen from the comparison between theoretical and experimental results that the underlying mechanism of the reaction should be quite different as compared to that assumed in the existing theoretical approach ( because the energy and momentum dependence derived from the theory have opposite trends than the experiments showing  see fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) .",
    "a similar disagreement has also been observed in electromagnetic knock - out of a @xmath36-pair from @xmath37 @xcite in the mainz experiments .",
    "so one can expect a quite different mechanism for such reactions at rather high momentum transfers as compared to that underlying the obe - picture of @xmath29 and @xmath28 interactions .",
    "the key problem in a consistent theoretical description for such experiments is that the large incident momentum of a high - energy projectile has to be shared among several nucleons in nuclei , which requires a very strong short - range correlation of nucleons @xcite .",
    "but the conventional picture of the correlations induced by the @xmath6-channel meson exchanges can transfer the high momentum only with high values of cut - off parameters @xmath38 , or , alternatively , by incorporation of the numerous diagrams with multiple rescatterings in intermediate state @xcite , which are out of the control .    in the last decade",
    ", numerous attempts have been made to describe the intermediate and short - range @xmath0 interaction within the framework of a cluster quark model employing the resonating group method ( rgm ) approach @xcite .",
    "however all these attempts were only partially successful and unable to extend the energy range much larger than 300400 mev .",
    "another serious problem with these qcd - inspired approaches is their inability to describe consistently the inelastic processes , e.g. the one- or two - pion productions .",
    "they focused only on the elastic @xmath0 scattering at rather low energies .",
    "thus we have now `` on the market '' two extreme types of models for the short and intermediate range @xmath0 interaction : either the traditional obe - type models which do not include any quarks , or the quark - motivated models which include the mesons only as the carriers of @xmath39 interaction @xcite , i.e. with no explicit mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , with such a limited basis the quark models immediately meet serious problems in the description of meson production in @xmath0 collisions ( which do require the incorporation of mesonic degrees of freedom in _ an explicit form _ ) .",
    "after the well - known work of weinberg @xcite the effective field theory ( eft ) approach became very popular and has been applied to the @xmath0 interaction and related phenomena in two forms : ( i ) in the `` pionless '' form which generalises somehow ( in field - theory language ) the effective range expansion @xcite and ( ii ) in the form of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . in both directions great progress has been made and full calculations up to high orders are now feasible . within the framework of chpt the calculations",
    "have been performed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for @xmath0 elastic scattering with energies up to 290 mev ( in lab .",
    "system ) and for deuteron properties .",
    "the authors @xcite used the chpt expansion up to fourth order ( i.e. @xmath40 ) and have derived the respective @xmath0-potential which leads to the same quality of fit for the @xmath0 phase shifts ( with @xmath41 ) as for the best modern phenomenological @xmath0-potentials . for this fit some 29 free parameters",
    "has been employed , 26 of them being related to parametrization of contact terms ( in @xmath42 ) .",
    "these contact terms , however , are out of the control by chiral theory and thus the description of short - range interaction is still on a purely phenomenological level .    ) taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , ( @xmath43 ) ref .",
    "@xcite and ( @xmath44 ) ref .",
    "[ fig2],height=377 ]    on the other hand , recent very powerful efforts of the juelich group to describe quantitatively the very abundant and precise new data on the neutral pion production cross sections and analyzing powers in @xmath45-collisions obtained in iucf @xcite have revealed a rather strong disagreement between well developed theory based on the meson - exchange approach and the polarization observables ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this means that the traditional models still fail to describe the @xmath9-production in @xmath10-collisions ( especially for the spin observables ) .",
    "there are also quite serious problems in the description of _ two - pion _ production in @xmath10-collisions found in recent experiments at uppsala @xcite . here",
    "the main focus is on the _ simultaneous description _ of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 pair production .",
    "while the existing theory is able to predict the data in one channel , e.g. in the @xmath46 channel , it fails to give a reasonable description in the other two channels ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "so , the existing theory seems not to include some important contribution(s ) in the two - pion production sector .     and @xmath49 ( quoted from ref .",
    "@xcite ) shown together with the previously existing data in the intermediate energy region @xcite .",
    "the curves represent theoretical predictions @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) shown together with the previously existing data in the intermediate energy region @xcite .",
    "the curves represent theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "[ fig3],title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=226 ]    all these problems are tightly interrelated to the short- and intermediate - range @xmath0 interaction .",
    "so , the understanding of this part of @xmath0-interaction should be essentially improved .",
    "it is worth to add here that some interesting new proposal dedicated to the experimental and theoretical study for short - range @xmath10 correlations in @xmath37 and other light nuclei have been elaborated very recently by a team in the us @xcite .",
    "but in their project the authors avoided any reference to microscopic or field - theory approaches and employed only some phenomenological estimations based on @xmath10 scattering in the high - energy region .    on the other hand ,",
    "the short - range @xmath0 correlations are very crucial for our understanding the nuclear properties at moderate and high momentum transfer and more deep insight into phase transitions in nuclear matter .",
    "it should be stressed here while the existing theory can treat the averaged nuclear properties like single - particle momentum distribution on the quantitative level it meets serious problems when explaining the two - body short - range correlations even for the lightest nuclei like @xmath37 , where we can treat now both bound states and also the three - nucleon continuum fully consistently ( i.e. with complete account of fsi and rescattering terms ) .",
    "thus all the above facts ( and also other arguments omitted here ) and experimental findings have motivated us to develop some alternative approach for the intermediate- and short - range nucleon - nucleon force and alternative mechanisms for single- and two - meson production and also for short - range correlations in nuclei .",
    "the present study is devoted to developing an alternative and new way for the treatment of the intermediate- and short - range correlations @xcite .",
    "this novel approach starts with an important observation that the @xmath6-channel nucleon - nucleon interaction induced by two - pion exchange with full account of @xmath8 correlation in @xmath50 state ( i.e. in the @xmath3 meson channel ) , being treated consistently , leads inevitably to strong short - range _ repulsion _ and very weak intermediate - range attraction @xcite instead of the strong attraction induced by the conventional @xmath3 meson exchange in obe - models where the @xmath3 is treated as a stable particle @xcite .",
    "this amazing result has been obtained recently by two independent methods @xcite and thus looks to be established rather reliably . moreover , in the latter work @xcite it was found that even the @xmath0 spin - orbit force induced by scalar @xmath8-exchange is almost totally _ repulsive _ , i.e. it is in sharp contrast to that which is required by the fit to @xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "so , we need some other general source for intermediate - range strong attraction and the short - range repulsion for the central @xmath0 force and also an another source for the strong attractive spin - orbital @xmath0 interaction .    the new force model proposed recently by two groups jointly : the moscow state university group and the tbingen university group @xcite , treats the intermediate- and short - range @xmath0-interaction as that proceeding through an intermediate dressed six - quark bag ( i.e. via @xmath1-channel mechanism ) : @xmath51 where the dressing by the meson fields ( mainly through the @xmath3-field ) surrounding the dense six - quark core strongly stabilizes the @xmath52-bag and shifts its mass downward to the @xmath0 threshold . the physical pattern underlying this new @xmath1-channel mechanism can be shortly outlined as follows @xcite .",
    "due to a strong attraction of the @xmath3-meson to the quarks in the @xmath7\\rangle$ ] configuration and spherical symmetry of the @xmath53 six - quark bag , the @xmath3-field will compress somehow the bag .",
    "this bag compression may induce very short - range scalar diquark correlations in the bag and enhances further the quark - meson interaction .",
    "all these attractive effects will compensate completely the energy losses originated from @xmath3-meson generation and rather high kinetic energy of quarks in the bag .",
    "so the net result of this interplay has been estimated to be strongly attractive .",
    "then we employed the quark - meson microscopic model @xcite to estimate these effects and to construct the respective new model for the @xmath0 interaction at short ranges .",
    "our extensive tests have demonstrated @xcite that this model works very well and makes it possible to explain many long - standing puzzles in the field , e.g. it uses the ope terms with proper cut - off parameters @xmath54 gev .",
    "the new model predicts also the appearance of a strong three - nucleon scalar force induced by @xmath3-exchange between the dressed bag and the third nucleon .    to study the effects of the new @xmath28 scalar force",
    "when calculating the properties of @xmath55 and @xmath37 nuclei , we have developed @xcite some multi - component formalism which made it possible to include both nucleonic and dibaryon components into @xmath28 wave functions .",
    "it has been found @xcite the latter components in @xmath28 wave function has a quite noticeable weight ( @xmath56 or even higher ) and these contribute very essentially to the total @xmath28 binding energy .",
    "thus the interplay between two - body and three - body force contributions peculiar to the conventional force models is changed drastically in the new approach . however , despite of this , we were still able to describe fully quantitatively , with no adjustable parameters , the basic static properties of @xmath55 and @xmath37 nuclei , especially the coulomb displacement energy @xmath57 which was a long - standing puzzle in the field .",
    "thus we can summarize here that albeit the new force model predicts some novel features of nuclear force it leads , at least , for static observables , largely to the same @xmath28 observables as for other modern approaches like cd - bonn @xmath58 uix or tm forces .",
    "however many other effects in strong or electroweak interaction phenomena will be described in fully different manner with the new force model .    in previous versions of the model @xcite , we extensively employed the semi - relativistic quark - meson microscopic model and @xmath3-meson dressing and have fitted the lower partial @xmath0 phase shifts with the model up to 1 gev . however , in order to work reliably in the range 13 gev we need a consistent fully relativistic approach .",
    "another important application of the new force model was a treatment of short - range @xmath59 interaction within the same dressed bag model @xcite .",
    "this part of @xmath59 interaction is at the moment still poorly known , however it can be crucially important in the description of numerous processes in two- and few - nucleon systems going through @xmath60-isobar current and accompanied by a large momentum transfer , like one- or two - pion photoproduction @xmath61 , @xmath62 etc . in our new field theoretical approach the @xmath59 and @xmath63 channels are considered on the same footing as @xmath0 channel by calculating the respective @xmath59 and @xmath63 loops of the dressed dibaryon @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the formalism developed makes it possible , in general , to treat the elastic and inelastic channels in a unified way ( see the subsequent section of the article ) .",
    "the only possible way that meets the above general requirements which the present authors can presently imagine is a fully covariant field - theoretical approach .",
    "effective field - theory approaches became very popular in this field in last decade .",
    "such an effective field approach is ideally suited for our purposes because it includes in an absolutely natural manner the relativistic formalism and the processes ( in intermediate and final states ) with generation of other particles ( mesons , isobars etc . ) .",
    "it can deal also quite naturally with meson and baryon loops in the intermediate states .",
    "thus we propose in the current work to develop a unified effective field theoretical approach to treat intermediate- and short - range @xmath0-interaction at low and intermediate energies of 13 gev jointly with description of meson production processes at @xmath10 and @xmath36 collisions .",
    "the clear distinction of the present force model from the existing ones in this aspect is the appearance of new ( dressed ) dibaryon components in all nuclei with quite significant weight @xmath64 .",
    "this component can absorb , contrary to the conventional single - nucleon picture , a large momentum and energy .",
    "so , many processes associated , e.g. with high momentum transfer , can proceed easily through this new dibaryon component , the latter being excited by external probe can produce e.g. a few mesons , or an isobar etc . and",
    "these production processes through the intermediate dressed dibaryon should have much a higher probability than the corresponding processes by absorption on one nucleon or on a meson - exchange current .",
    "our first calculations made within the framework of this approach to treat some electromagnetic processes in @xmath29 and @xmath28 systems have lead to quite promising results @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , we explain the new physical model for intermediate and short - range @xmath0 interaction . in section 3 ,",
    "an effective field - theoretical approach is developed , which describes in the field - theoretical language the above physical model with @xmath1-channel dibaryon generation .",
    "section 4 is devoted to derivation of a relativistic @xmath0-potential using the formalism developed above . the semi - phenomenological nonrelativistic model proposed by our joint group",
    "previously is compared with the present treatment . in section 5 ,",
    "we dwell briefly on a generalization of our approach to other hadronic processes like single- and two - meson production in @xmath10-collisions . in conclusion",
    ", we summarize the content of the work .",
    "here we will outline a multiquark model for the intermediate dressed dibaryon in @xmath1-channel , whose formation is assumed to be responsible in our approach for intermediate- and short - range @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we start with an observation done a decade ago @xcite that from two possible space symmetries , viz .",
    "@xmath65_x\\otimes[3]_x=[6]_x\\oplus[42]_x$ ] , the @xmath7_x\\rangle$]-component has comparable projections onto three possible two - cluster components , viz . @xmath66 and @xmath67 , while the second possible component @xmath68_x\\rangle$ ] , which corresponds to the @xmath69 excited six - quark configuration ( more exactly a coherent sum of many such components ) , has a large projection onto the @xmath70 channel only .",
    "thus , the fully symmetric part of the total six - quark wave function @xmath7_x\\rangle$ ] can be identified with the bag - like structure while the mixed symmetry part @xmath68_x\\rangle$ ] should be associated with the cluster - like @xmath70 component .",
    "hence , from the six - quark symmetry point of view the @xmath69-excited six - quark part corresponds to the proper initial @xmath0 channel while the ground @xmath7_x\\rangle$ ] part includes mainly the intermediate bag - like components .",
    "therefore the whole @xmath1-channel process going through the intermediate dressed dibaryon can be represented by the following chain of steps :    1 .",
    "fusion of two three - quark nucleon clusters into @xmath69 excited six - quark system with the space symmetry @xmath68_x\\rangle$ ] .",
    "emission of two @xmath71-wave pions from the excited mixed symmetry bag with subsequent formation of the scalar isoscalar @xmath3-meson due to very strong correlation of these two @xmath71-wave pions : @xmath68_x\\rangle\\rightarrow|\\mathrm{s}^6\\rangle+(\\pi\\pi)_{j = i=0}$ ] .",
    "generation of the spherical dense six - quark bag @xmath72 in which the spherical core is surrounded by strong scalar @xmath3-field that compresses the quark bag due to strong attraction between @xmath3-field and quarks .    in this new phase ,",
    "one has two very important features characterizing the six - quark dynamics of the bag :    * partial restoration of the chiral symmetry , that leads to strong reduction in both @xmath3-meson and constituent quark masses ; * essential enhancement of diquark correlations in the bag due to the bag compression fm @xcite . ] .",
    "this enhancement should lead to additional energy gain in the process .",
    "these two strong effects lead to a strong effective attraction in @xmath0-channel at intermediate range . and",
    "this two - stage complicated mechanism replaces in our approach the simple @xmath6-channel @xmath3-exchange in conventional obe - models ( which is invalid as has been proved by recent studies @xcite  see the introduction ) and is the origin for intermediate range @xmath0-attraction .    however , this dressed bag state , being singlet in color space , has still a large overlap with the @xmath0-channel , so that this state can decay fast back into the initial @xmath0-channel .",
    "hence , this intermediate dibaryon has a large width ( @xmath73 mev ) and thus can not be visualized as a resonance - like bump in @xmath0 phase shifts or cross sections .",
    "our previous papers @xcite have demonstrated that this two - stage mechanism is quite able to explain with reasonable @xmath74 and @xmath75 coupling constants @xmath0 phase shifts in low partial waves up to 1 gev . so that , quite similar to the nucleon dressing by a pion field , the dibaryon is dressed mainly by the scalar - isoscalar @xmath3-field and",
    "the physical dibaryon should exist partially in the bare state and in the dressed state .",
    "resorting to a diquark language for description of the @xmath76 ( the dressed bag state ) transition , one can assume that two unpaired quarks from both nucleons form a diquark pair ( of scalar or axial - vector type ) and thus , the intermediate stage in the transition is a state composed from three diquarks .",
    "then such a three - diquark state gets dressed further with the @xmath3-field that squeezes the bag . as a consequence",
    ", it can become favourable for diquarks to condense @xcite at large energies . at the same time , the chiral symmetry gets partially restored , i.e. we are faced to a phase transition from the usual chiral - broken phase to the so - called color superconducting phase . in the present study",
    ", we are , of course , far from the regime of color superconductivity but the quark - quark correlations can still play a significant role already in low energy physics . in some way",
    "diquarks can serve as useful constituents and building blocks in investigating the properties of multi - quark systems @xcite . anyway",
    ", the generation of the @xmath3-field in the symmetric @xmath52-bag leads to a large energy gain and the physical mass of the dressed bag shifts strongly downwards .",
    "effectively it corresponds to an appearance of a strong attractive force in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "another important issue in the suggested mechanism for @xmath76 transition is a domination of the excited mixed symmetry @xmath68 , lsi\\rangle$ ] in the initial stage of the transition , so that the resulting @xmath0-wave function has a nodal structure . that the @xmath69 excited mixed symmetry state dominates in the @xmath0-wave function over a fully symmetric non - excited @xmath7\\rangle$ ] configuration can be argued from various points of view .",
    "one argument is related to the specific spin - flavor nature of @xmath39 interaction in the goldstone - boson - exchange model @xcite . however , in this model for the @xmath39 force , both configurations lie rather high in energy , so that the effective @xmath0-interaction in both symmetries corresponds to repulsion .",
    "the second argument is that the @xmath3-dressing of the mixed symmetry bag : @xmath68\\rangle\\rightarrow|\\mathrm{s}^6[6]+\\sigma\\rangle$ ] leads to much stronger energy shift of the bare initial @xmath52-configuration than the respective shift of the symmetric state : @xmath7\\rangle\\rightarrow|\\mathrm{s}^6[6]+\\sigma\\rangle$ ] , because the latter process is in close analogy with the lamb shift ( due to interaction of quarks in the bag with vacuum fluctuations of the scalar field around the bag ) while in the first process the @xmath3-field is generated via a real deexcitation of two @xmath77-shell quarks and their transition to the @xmath78-orbit .",
    "the next section is devoted to the more formal and strict formulation of this qualitative pattern in terms of a covariant effective field theory .",
    "we are aiming to develop a consistent covariant field - theoretical description for the dibaryon model of nuclear forces , which allows us to go up to the intermediate energy region 13 gev inaccessible to chpt .",
    "this approach leads to the important modification of the force model : there arises a consistent scheme for the dressing of @xmath52-bag in terms of effective field theory . here",
    "the additional account of mesonic degrees of freedom in the dbs leads to an addition of corresponding loops in the complete polarization operator of the dibaryon , instead of a total replacement of the vertices in the transition @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , ( as was in our previous version of the model @xcite and was described briefly in the preceding section ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "-channel @xmath0 interaction through the intermediate dressed dibaryon @xmath81 ( the peripheral one - pion exchanges are also shown ) .",
    "the graphs in the second row illustrate some possible diagrams for the dibaryon dressing.[fig4],width=491 ]    it is important to stress that such a field theoretical picture allows to carry out a natural matching between the field theory approach at low - energies ( where chpt is fully applicable ) and the high energy region . in both regions",
    "one can now formulate a field theoretical language .",
    "in such an approach , the peripheral , i.e. the `` external '' part of @xmath0-interaction is described by the conventional @xmath2- and @xmath8-exchanges in the @xmath6-channel while the intermediate and short range interaction is described via generation of an intermediate dressed dibaryon which can be represented as a color quantum string able to vibrate and rotate . in the present model the intermediate dibaryon",
    "is produced by the color exchange between two quarks belonging to different nucleons with subsequent formation of a double string ( possibly with diquark clusterization due to a strong @xmath3-field generated on later stages of the process ) .",
    "the schematic evolution for this process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . to be more specific , we assume when the two quarks belonging to different @xmath82-clusters interact and exchange a color , this can lead to the formation of either a nonconfined six - quark state ( i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath59 , etc . ) or a confined @xmath52-state locking by a hexagon - type string @xcite . the first non - resonance process is , in fact , analogous in action to conventional meson exchange , while the second leads to formation of a hidden color @xmath83-state . in diquark language ,",
    "the first mechanism can be represented by the diagram with two interacting quarks forming a color representation @xmath84 of su(3 ) group , because the one - gluon exchange or instanton induced interaction between quarks in this channel is repulsive .",
    "but if two interacting quarks form the system in a @xmath85 color representation , the attractive correlations may lead to patching the quarks and as a consequence to the diquark formation . in this latter case",
    ", the dibaryon can be modeled as a system of three diquarks connected by y - type string .",
    "means that there are possible diquark correlations in dibaryon .",
    "[ fig5],width=491 ]      because the value of quark radius of a nucleon is around 0.6 fm and the interaction between quarks can proceed also at the peripheral regions of both nucleons , the size of the intermediate dibaryon can be around 1 fm , so that the dibaryon can not be considered as a point - like object .",
    "thus , the transition amplitude @xmath86 must be described through the non - local lagrangian density : @xmath87 |2,1\\rangle-\\mathrm{i}\\langle 4,3|\\mathrm{i}|2,1\\rangle.\\ ] ] here t means time - ordering while the bra and ket @xmath88 and @xmath89 relates to the initial and final nucleons with 4-momenta @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively . the second term in ( [ eq0 ] ) , where @xmath92 is the unit matrix , corresponds to the propagation of noninteracting nucleons and thus must be subtracted .",
    "the nonlocal lagrangian density in eq .

    "the @xmath315 is approximated here , for the sake of simplicity , by a simple local gaussian function @xmath317 the term @xmath318 in eq.([eq86 ] ) describes the intermediate- and short - range interaction ( @xmath319 fm ) induced by the dressed dibaryon formation in intermediate state .",
    "after the nonrelativistic reduction of the general expression ( [ eq21 ] ) , the @xmath318 part of interaction in the uncoupled @xmath171 channel can be rewritten in the form : @xmath320 where @xmath321 , @xmath322 are nonrelativistic h.o .",
    "functions of 0s and 2s form , @xmath323 is an arbitrary , but a large positive constant ( @xmath324 mev ) ) , according to our general approach , serves to represent the strong @xmath0 repulsion when the intermediate six - quark bag has @xmath325_x\\rangle$ ] structure @xcite . ] .",
    "the energy - dependent strength parameter @xmath326 is calculated straightforwardly from the @xmath3-meson loop shown in fig .",
    "it was shown earlier , the above loop integral can be well approximated in the energy range 01 gev by a simple pade - approximant : @xmath327 with parameter values , @xmath328 and @xmath329 , presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , while the strength constant , @xmath330 , is proportional to the @xmath331 coupling constant which determines the coupling of the @xmath3-field and six - quark core .",
    "this constant is taken in this illustrative model as a free parameter .",
    "so we have in the model only four free parameters , two of which , @xmath332 and @xmath333 , are related to the two - pion exchange potential in the peripheral region , and the other two , @xmath330 and @xmath334 are related to the dressed dibaryon properties .",
    "two parameters of @xmath315 are fixed easily by fitting two effective range parameters which describe the @xmath171 phase shifts until 15 mev .",
    "so , we are left with only two basic parameters related to the properties of the @xmath52-bag to describe the @xmath171 phase shifts in a very large energy range 151000 mev . by varying these two parameters",
    "we arrive at the high quality fit displayed in the fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( upper left panel ) .",
    "for the @xmath180-@xmath181 coupled channels we can derive the model from the general formulas by a manner similar to the uncoupled @xmath171 case .",
    "now , the dibaryon part of interaction , @xmath318 , can be presented in the matrix form :     potential model similar to that given in eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) ) for some lower @xmath0 phase shifts and respective phase shift analysis ( taken from said).[fig9 ] ]    @xmath335    where the matrix operator @xmath336 takes the form : @xmath337    one can attain a quite good description of the triplet phase shift in the whole energy range 01 gev even when choosing the one common value of the oscillator radius for the @xmath1-wave , @xmath338 , and @xmath339-wave , @xmath340 , potential form factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq90 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath329 , that determines the energy variation of all the strength parameters @xmath341 is kept the same as in @xmath171-channel . so that in the @xmath180-@xmath181 coupled channel case , one has ( except of two parameters in @xmath315 ) only three adjustable strength parameters , viz . @xmath342 and @xmath343 which make it possible to fit with a good quality the phase shifts together with the respective tensor mixing parameter in a very large energy range 151000 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , upper right and two lower panels)-wave oscillator parameter can be allowed to vary , the quality of the fit may become almost perfect . ] .",
    "thus , the illustrative model derived from eft - approach developed in the work makes it possible , using physically transparent interaction model with a minimal number of free parameters , to fit very reasonably the phase shifts in @xmath171 and @xmath180-@xmath181 channels in the large energy range and the deuteron structure as well .",
    "this description can be compared to the fit quality for the phase shifts given by a purely phenomenological separable interaction ( of conventional type ) of graz group @xcite .",
    "the latter model includes more than twenty five free parameters to fit the phase shifts in the same channels until 500 mev only .",
    "thus the description of the elastic @xmath0 scattering given by the present illustrative model derived from eft - formalism looks highly superior the description attained with the phenomenological separable models .",
    "it is worth to emphasize here that , at the value of the string excitation quantum @xmath188 mev , taking up to two - quanta excitations of the string will be sufficient for description of @xmath0-interaction from zero energy until 1 gev or even higher , while account of four - quanta excitations is sufficient for description of interaction in @xmath0-channel or the @xmath0 meson - production processes up to energies of @xmath344 gev .",
    "having developed the field - theoretical formalism for the description of the @xmath0 elastic scattering in the gev region one can apply this also to describe inelastic processes within the same framework , i.e. with the same input constants etc . and",
    "this possibility is one of main advantage of this unified approach . for the sake of brevity",
    "we will omit many details here and illustrate the description of inelastic processes by some graphs only .    in the above field - theoretical formalism the inelastic processes are tightly interrelated to the elastic ones above the respective thresholds through the unitarity relation : @xmath345 which corresponds in our language to the respective cuts of the diagrams across the meson loops .",
    "so , the respective meson production amplitudes can be illustrated by the graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the left graph relates to @xmath8-production in @xmath10-collisions through the intermediate @xmath3-meson in the dressed bag , while the graph on the right relates to the near - threshold @xmath5-meson production to the intermediate @xmath346-isobar generation .",
    "it should be stressed here that the @xmath0 `` distorted waves '' in such meson production amplitudes are generated _ from the same diagrams _ ( with the same parameter values ) as these meson productions .",
    "so the approach can be made quite consistent and universal both for elastic and inelastic processes .",
    "-meson emission in a nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "[ fig10],title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] -meson emission in a nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "[ fig10],title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    another very important issue which can be answered on the basis of the developed approach is multi - meson production and generation of the so called cumulative pions in high - energy @xmath10 collisions . according to the relativistic picture presented here",
    ", the multi - meson production should correspond to @xmath347 excitation of the intermediate string ( @xmath348 ) with its subsequent deexcitation by multi - meson emission or by hadronic jets .    by a similar mechanism one can get the emission of cumulative pions ( i.e. forbidden in a single - nucleon emission ) , e.g. in the process @xmath349 , where the energy of outgoing pion is larger then half energy of the incident deuterons .",
    "the appearance of the dibaryon component in a nucleus can modify noticeably the nucleon momentum distribution probed at large momentum transfer .",
    "e.g. one gets some new contributions to electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knock - out processes in which the emerging two nucleons ( from the excited dibaryon decay ) escape from the dibaryon state in `` back - to - back '' kinematics .",
    "in fact , just this kinematics was observed for the two - nucleon ejection in many experiments of this type .",
    "it is evident that such contributions for the @xmath350 and @xmath12 processes at high ( virtual ) momenta or energies of @xmath351-quantum must contribute to the reaction cross sections .",
    "in such two - nucleon processes , when treated within our approach , the virtual high - energy ( or momentum ) can be absorbed by the string ( i.e. by the dibaryon as a whole ) resulting in its excitation followed by either meson emission or break up of the excited dibaryon into the two high - energy nucleons ( see e.g. the fig .",
    "also , the inverse process of bremsstrahlung in @xmath10-scattering : @xmath352 should be analysed with the same new currents .    ]    , width=491 ]    another good test of the force model developed here will be in prediction of the main characteristic features of e .-",
    "processes like @xmath353 , @xmath354 , or @xmath355 with linearly or circularly polarized @xmath351-quanta which are planned to be measured in mainz @xcite . for calculations of such processes our very accurate @xmath37 wavefunctions",
    "@xcite found with the above force model can be employed jointly with new e .-",
    "currents tightly interrelated to the dressed dibaryon degree of freedom .",
    "some diagrams for these new @xmath1-channel currents in two - nucleon systems are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the @xmath1-channel meson - exchange currents for @xmath356 or @xmath357 processes should be confronted with the traditional @xmath6-channel currents for @xmath358-subsystem ( see the fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) and we can conclude from this comparison that both types of currents , i.e. @xmath6- and @xmath1-channel ones can be considered as a complementary to each other .",
    "in other words , those @xmath6-channel currents which disappear in the @xmath10-system ( i.e. pion - in - flight etc . ) will appear in form of @xmath1-channel currents .",
    "the same occurs also for @xmath36-system .",
    "thus the processes like @xmath359 or @xmath360 or @xmath361 should be a very good test for the new electromagnetic currents .",
    "hence , the dressed dibaryon component and new currents associated with it should modify the results of the theoretical interpretations of many dedicated experiments done at moderate to high momentum and energy transfers , especially those which are now going on or are planned at mainz and bonn .",
    "bremsstrahlung within traditional obe - models of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "[ fig13],width=491 ]      the first attempts to apply the dbs - model for description of properties of three - nucleon systems @xcite was very successful . in particular , it has been clearly demonstrated that the new short - range three - body attractive force induced by @xmath3-meson exchange between the dbs and third nucleon ( see the fig . [ fig11 ] ) with the @xmath362 coupling constant adjusted to give the @xmath55 binding energy gives an important contribution to the @xmath28 binding energy and other properties of @xmath28-system , and can explain quantitatively all static properties of @xmath37 and @xmath55 ground states , including a precise parameter - free description of the coulomb displacement energy of @xmath37@xmath55 @xcite , and all the charge distributions in these nuclei .    in these @xmath28 calculations done within the above dibaryon @xmath0-force model with additional incorporation of three - nucleon scalar forces shown by the graphs in the fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , the weight of the dibaryon component in the @xmath28 wave function reaches as much as @xmath363% and its contribution to the total @xmath28 binding energy is about 50% ( ! ) . in other words ,",
    "half of the total nuclear binding comes from the strong interaction of dibaryon with surrounding nucleons via the @xmath3-meson exchange  @xcite .",
    "another important conclusion of these @xmath28 calculations is a strong density dependence of the effective two- and three - body forces induced by the intermediate dibaryon generation .",
    "the density dependence has a repulsive character and is qualitatively similar to that assumed in the phenomenological skyrme model .",
    "it is very likely that just the interplay between the above density dependent repulsion and @xmath29 and @xmath28 attraction related to the scalar meson exchange provides the saturation property of nuclear matter .",
    "we developed in the work some covariant effective field - theoretical approach toward the description of intermediate- and short - range components of @xmath0 interaction and nuclear forces .",
    "the approach assumes that the nucleon - nucleon interaction at intermediate and short ranges has a very complicated and multistep character . in the first step ,",
    "the two - nucleon system goes , by color exchange , to the confined two - cluster @xmath83 configuration where the quark clusters are moving at the end of a quantum string ( inside of which the gluon fields are localized ) .",
    "excitations ( i.e. vibrations and rotations ) of this string can be described by a relativistic covariant harmonic oscillator with a linear confinement potential which leads quite naturally to the linear regge - trajectory of the respective excited levels of the string . in the next step ,",
    "the string interacts with vacuum meson fields ( mainly @xmath364 and @xmath5 ) and thus it goes to the dibaryon stage by the respective dressing .",
    "it is shown that @xmath69-excitation of the string generates a strong scalar @xmath3-field which , due to the strong attraction to the six - quark core , will compress and stabilize the resulting dressed six - quark bag .    in some aspect",
    "the emerged picture should be rather similar to the concept of `` small chiral bag '' suggested long ago by brown and rho @xcite . in their model the @xmath82-mit bag is compressed by the strong pressure of its pion ( chiral ) field to the small size where the additional inner kinetic pressure of free quarks will compensate the external pressure of the pion field to the bag surface . in our case ,",
    "in contrast to the above `` small bag model '' , the main meson field is a strong scalar @xmath3-field which interacts with the six quark system in the whole volume of the bag rather than on the its surface only .",
    "another great difference from the brown - rho model is the origin of the stabilizing field ( @xmath3 in our case ) . in our approach the main component of this scalar field",
    "is emerged in deexcitation of the string from @xmath69 to @xmath365 states .",
    "thus , in this process one observes the transformation of the `` color '' energy of gluon fields ( inside the string ) to the `` white '' energy of scalar meson field .    in the next stage of the process ,",
    "the @xmath3 field will compress and stabilize the six - quark bag and shift strongly its mass down to the pion - production threshold .",
    "thus this shift should be included to the polarization operator @xmath366 of the total string propagator .",
    "further , keeping in mind a strong coupling of the @xmath3-meson to the two - pion channel one can predict from this specific dressing mechanism an enhanced two - pion production in @xmath0 collision as compared to the traditional obe - models , the feature just observed experimentally .",
    "moreover , almost the same mechanism can enhance quite naturally the single - pion production in @xmath10-collision and especially the near threshold @xmath367 production .",
    "the consistent theoretical explanation of which met so serious problems in the recent decade @xcite .",
    "moreover , a quite similar two - stage mechanism ( in first stage , the excitation of the color string with the subsequent transformation of the `` color '' string energy to the meson fields ) should be responsible for multi - meson production in @xmath0 and heavy ion collisions .",
    "so , by this way , the multi - meson production in high - energy heavy - ion collision may give a good test for the proposed color string model .",
