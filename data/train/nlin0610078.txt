    "cellular automata ( ca ) can be viewed as cells in a regular lattice updated synchronously according to a local interaction rule , where the state of each cell is restricted to a finite set of allowed values .",
    "an interesting subclass of ca consists of rules possessing an additive invariant .",
    "the simplest of such invariants is the total number of sites in a particular state .",
    "ca with such invariant , often called `` conservative ca '' or `` number - conserving ca '' , can be viewed as a system of interacting and moving particles , where in the case of a binary rule , 1 s represent sites occupied by particles , and 0 s represent empty sites .    in a finite system ,",
    "the flux or current of particles in equilibrium depends only on their density , which is invariant .",
    "the graph of the current as a function of density characterizes many features of the flow , and is therefore called the fundamental diagram . for a majority of conservative ca rules ,",
    "fundamental diagrams are piecewise - linear , usually possessing one or more `` sharp corners '' or singularities .",
    "there exist a strong evidence of universal behavior at singularities , as reported in @xcite .",
    "conservative ca appear in various applications , and some special cases have been studied extensively .",
    "rule 184 , which is a discrete version of the totally asymmetric exclusion process , is an example of such special case @xcite .",
    "although much is known about this particular rule , dynamics of other conservative rules exhibits many features which are not fully understood , and more general results are just starting to appear @xcite .",
    "in particular , there exists no general result explaining the shape of fundamental diagrams for conservative ca , although promising results have been obtained for some special cases by kujala and lukka @xcite , who studied a class of deterministic traffic rules introduced by @xcite . using their results",
    ", we will study numerically behavior of singularities for number - conserving rules with fundamental diagrams different that previously reported .",
    "it should be emphasized at this point that all ca rules considered in this paper are strictly deterministic .",
    "nevertheless , they are strongly related to stochastic ca models of road traffic flow , which have gained widespread attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we will assume that the dynamics takes place on one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the state of the lattice site @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "all operations on spatial indices @xmath5 are assumed to be modulo @xmath3 .",
    "we will further assume that @xmath9 , and we will say that the site @xmath5 is occupied ( empty ) at time @xmath6 if @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "let @xmath18 be a function @xmath19 , also called a _",
    "local function _ the update rule for the cellular automaton is given by @xmath20 the ca rule given by ( [ cadef ] ) will be called _ number conserving _ if @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "note that the above condition simply states that the number of occupied sites is constant in time",
    ".    in @xcite , hattori and takesue demonstrated that ca rules are number - conserving if and only if a discrete version of a standard current conservation law @xmath23 is satisfied .",
    "more precisely , ca rule @xmath18 is number - conserving if and only if for all @xmath24 it satisfies @xmath25 where @xmath26    applying this to all lattice sites we obtain @xmath27 where we dropped @xmath6 dependence for clarity .    the above equation can be interpreted in a similar way as a conservation law in a continuous , one dimensional physical system . in such system , let @xmath28 denote the density of some material at point @xmath29 and time @xmath6 , and let @xmath30 be the current ( flux ) of this material at point @xmath29 and time @xmath6 .",
    "a conservation law states that the rate of change of the total amount of material contained in a fixed domain is equal to the flux of that material across the surface of the domain .",
    "the differential form of this condition can be written as @xmath31    interpreting @xmath4 as the density , the left hand side of ( [ allsitescons ] ) is simply the change of density in a single time step , so that ( [ allsitescons ] ) is an obvious discrete analog of the current conservation law ( [ concons ] ) with @xmath32 playing the role of the current .",
    "let us now assume that the initial distribution @xmath33 is a bernoulli distribution , i.e. , at @xmath34 , all sites @xmath4 are independently occupied with probability @xmath35 or empty with probability @xmath36 , where @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "let us define @xmath38 since the initial distribution is @xmath5-independent , we expect that @xmath39 also does not depend on @xmath5 , and we will therefore define @xmath40 . furthermore , for conservative ca , @xmath41 is @xmath6-independent , so we define @xmath42 . for the aforementioned bernoulli distribution",
    "we thus obtain @xmath43 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath44 as the density of occupied sites .",
    "the expected value of the current @xmath45 will also be @xmath5-independent , so we can define the expected current as @xmath46    the graph of the equilibrium current @xmath47 versus the density @xmath44 is known as the fundamental diagram .",
    "it has been numerically demonstrated @xcite that for conservative deterministic ca the fundamental diagram usually develops a singularity as @xmath48 , meaning that @xmath49 is not everywhere differentiable function of @xmath44 .",
    "a well - know example is ca rule 184 , for which @xmath50 and @xmath18 is defined by @xmath51 the above definition can also be written in a form ( [ allsitescons ] ) as @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the graph of the equilibrium current for this rule is shown in figure  [ examplefd]a .",
    "the singularity appears at @xmath54 .",
    "rules with indicated wolfram s numbers . ]    quite often , fundamental diagrams of number - conserving rules consist of a finite number of linear segments separated by similar singularities , as shown in figure  [ examplefd]b  d .    since number - conserving ca",
    "rules conserve the number of occupied sites , we can label each occupied site ( or `` particle '' ) with an integer @xmath55 , such that the closest particle to the right of particle @xmath56 is labeled @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath58 denotes the position of particle @xmath56 at time @xmath6 , the configuration of the particle system at time @xmath6 is described by the increasing bisequence @xmath59 .",
    "we can then specify how the position of the particle at the time step @xmath60 depends on positions of the particle and its neighbours at the time step @xmath6 .",
    "for example , for rule 184 one obtains @xmath61    equation ( [ r184 - 00 ] ) is sometimes referred to as the motion representation . for",
    "arbitrary number - conserving ca rule it is possible to obtain the motion representation by employing algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the motion representation is analogous to lagrange representation of the fluid flow , in which we observe individual particles and follow their trajectories . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ r184 - 02 ] ) could be called lagrange representation , because it describes the process at a fixed point in space .",
    "the euler - lagrange analogy has been explored in @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "the choice between euler and langrange description of the number - conserving ca is usually dictated by convenience .",
    "cellular automata rules which we want to consider in this paper are easier to define using the euler paradigm , as we will see in the next section .",
    "in what follows , we will consider a class of ca rules first introduced in @xcite .",
    "they are defined in terms of two positive integers @xmath62 ( maximum speed ) and @xmath63 ( blocking parameter ) .",
    "these rules can be interpreted as simplified deterministic models of road traffic flow with driver s anticipation .",
    "occupied sites represent cars on a single - lane road .",
    "all cars move synchronously using the following algorithm .",
    "driver of each car first locates the nearest gap ( cluster of empty sites ) in front of him , the length of this gap denoted by @xmath64 .",
    "if the first empty site ( i.e. , the first site belonging to the aforementioned gap ) is further than @xmath63 sites ahead , the car does not move , otherwise , it moves to the site @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",

    "at all such singularities , numerical evidence suggests that the relaxation to the equilibrium follows the same power law , i.e. @xmath111 .    the two singularities in rule @xmath96 are different from the singularity observed in @xmath74 , since they separate linear segments of the fundamental diagram from the nonlinear segment .",

    "is the same , therefore we are only considering @xmath124 .",
    "we can see that at the singularity the power law behavior is observed , as evidenced by the straight line in the log - log plot .",

    "this suggests that singularities in @xmath96 have the same nature as singularities in other number - conserving rules . to confirm this observation",

    "divergence of the decay time at the critical point @xmath104 is somewhat similar to the critical slowing down observed in phase transitions  the closer to the singularity , the longer it takes to reach the steady state .",
    "in fact , it is possible to define the order parameter for rule @xmath96 , thus interpreting the singularity at @xmath104 as the critical point in a second - order kinetic phase transition .",
    "we will first note that the maximum possible current occurs when all particles are moving with the maximum speed , which for @xmath144 is @xmath107 , hence the maximum current is equal to @xmath145 .",

    "( [ r22flux ] ) , it is possible to obtain series expansion of @xmath146 around @xmath104 for @xmath148 : @xmath149 the critical exponent beta , normally defined by @xmath150 , is therefore equal to @xmath2 .",
    "again , this is in agreement with the value of @xmath1 obtained for other number - conserving rules @xcite .",
    "in spite of all similarities to other number - conserving rules , the behavior of @xmath96 is somewhat unusual , especially in the intermediate phase , where the fundamental diagram is nonlinear .",
    "as mentioned earlier , dynamics of number - conserving ca rules somewhat resembles dynamics of the kinematic wave equation , which describes propagation of density waves in a continuous medium . for the kinematic wave equation , the slope of the fundamental diagram at a given point represents velocity of density waves .",
    "it turns out that the slope of the fundamental diagram for number - conserving ca can be interpreted in a similar way .    in the free moving phase , the slope of the fundamental diagram given by eq .",
    "( [ r22flux ] ) is equal to @xmath151 .",
    "compare this to figure  [ patterns](a ) showing the spatio - temporal diagram for @xmath152 , which is in the free - moving phase . if we treat regions of alternating blocks @xmath153 and @xmath154 as the `` background '' @xmath155 , then white structures can be clearly identified in that background",
    "they propagate to the right with velocity @xmath107 .",
    "these are analogs of density waves  in fact , they are regions of local density smaller than @xmath156 , i.e. , blocks of zeros longer than 2 or block of ones shorter than 2 .",
    "free moving phase is dominated by such density waves . on the other hand , in the jammed phase ,",
    "only density waves propagating to the left with velocity @xmath157 remain in the steady state , as shown in figure  [ patterns](d ) .",
    "this again agrees with the slope of the fundamental diagram given by eq .",
    "( [ r22flux ] ) : in the jammed phase , @xmath158 .",
    "the intermediate phase is the most interesting one , because its dynamics is not dominated by a single type of density waves .",
    "figures  [ patterns](b ) and ( c ) show two examples of spatio - temporal patterns in the intermediate phase .",
    "one can clearly see that two types of density waves are present .",
    "blocks containing isolated zeros propagate to the right , while blocks with isolated ones move to the left .",
    "when these two types collide , they both are slightly delayed , but after the collision , they continue with the pre - collision velocity .",
    "one could thus say that these density waves are somewhat similar to solitons ",
    "they preserve their shape and velocity in a collision .",
    "the balance between these two types of density waves determines the steady - state current .",
