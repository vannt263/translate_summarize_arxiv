    "beginning with the seminal proposal by kane @xcite , there has been intense interest , for over a decade , in the use of si : p @xcite as qubits for quantum information processing .",
    "this donor - impurity spin - system continues to demonstrate an ever - increasing list of advantages for manipulation and storage of quantum information with currently available electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) technology .",
    "the si : p system has four levels due to the electron spin @xmath3 coupled to a @xmath4p nuclear spin @xmath5 .",
    "the key advantages are the comparatively long decoherence times , which have been measured to be of order milliseconds for the electron spin , for natural si : p .",
    "they are of order seconds for the nuclear spin , so the nuclear spin has been identified @xcite as a resource for storing the quantum information . for all but",
    "the weakest magnetic fields ( i.e. @xmath6 g ) @xcite , the electron and nuclear spins are uncoupled so may be addressed and manipulated independently by a combination of microwave ( mw ) and radio - frequency ( rf ) pulses respectively .",
    "the two possible electron - spin transitions correspond to epr spectral lines , while the nuclear spin transitions are nmr lines .",
    "nuclear spin - flips are much slower : a @xmath7-pulse in the nmr case takes three orders of magnitude longer than for the epr - allowed transitions .    however , over the last year or so , there has also been increasing interest in another shallow donor impurity in silicon , the bismuth atom @xcite .",
    "the si : bi system is unique in several respects : it is the deepest donor , with a binding energy of about 71 mev ; it has a very large nuclear spin , @xmath8 ; it has an exceptionally large hyperfine coupling strength , @xmath9 ghz ; in addition , @xmath10bi is mono - isotopic .",
    "recent measurements of the decoherence times in natural silicon have revealed @xmath11 times of order @xmath12 larger than for si : p , an effect attributed to the smaller bohr radius of si : bi @xcite .",
    "the dominant decoherence process is the spin diffusion @xcite associated with the @xmath13 , @xmath14si nuclei occupying just under @xmath15 of sites in natural silicon ; the dominant @xmath16si isotope has no nuclear spin and thus does not contribute to the dipole - coupled flip - flop process which drives the spin diffusion . a recent study of p donors in @xmath16si purified to such a high degree ( less than 50 ppm of @xmath14si ) that spin diffusion may be neglected , revealed @xmath11 times potentially up to @xmath17s @xcite .",
    "although studies of isotopically enriched si : bi have yet to be undertaken , decoherence times of the same order are possible .",
    "the coupling with @xmath14si was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the very large nuclear spin @xmath8 and associated large hilbert space may provide a means of storing more information @xcite .",
    "efficient hyperpolarization of the system ( to about @xmath18 ) was demonstrated experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the present study investigates the implications of the very large hyperfine coupling , @xmath9 ghz of si : bi , as well as its large nuclear spin .",
    "while mixing of the zeeman sublevels @xmath19 is not unexpected and has even been investigated for si : p for weak magnetic fields @xcite , for si : bi the regime where the hyperfine coupling competes with the external field , i.e. @xmath20 , is attained for magnetic fields @xmath21 t which are moderate , but within the normal epr range . in a previous paper @xcite we identified interesting consequences in this range of magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , we identified a set of points and field values associated with `` cancellation resonances '' , thus named because of an analogy with the electron spin echo envelope modulation ( eseem ) phenomenon of `` exact cancellation '' @xcite . at the cancellation resonances ,",
    "as we see below , the system hamiltonian takes a simpler form .",
    "here we investigate the relative advantages of these regimes for qip .",
    "a recent experimental study using an s - band ( 4 ghz ) pulsed epr spectrometer @xcite identified a set of 4-states of si : bi which are , at high fields , entirely analogous to the 4-level subspace of si : p but have the advantage that all four possible transitions may be driven by fast epr transitions ( on a nanosecond timescale ) , in contrast to si : p , where the two nmr transitions are three orders of magnitude slower .",
    "the study showed that for si : bi in the intermediate field regime , it is possible to equalize the time for a @xmath7-rotation of two transitions which correspond to an epr and nmr transition respectively , at high fields .",
    "we show that this represents a novel scheme to implement universal quantum computation using , exclusively , fast epr technology .",
    "this represents a clear advantage offered by the si : bi system .    in @xcite",
    ", it was suggested that the `` cancellation resonance '' points might offer further advantages in minimising and controlling exchange coupled perturbations .",
    "here we do not investigate this , but consider effects of @xmath22-noise and @xmath23-noise ( in other words gaussian temporal magnetic - field fluctuations along the @xmath23 and @xmath22 direction ) on decoherence .",
    "this may be relevant to the behavior of isotopically enriched si : bi .",
    "we show that for z noise , which is usually adiabatic , the @xmath1 points offer decoherence - free zones .",
    "in analogy with work done on superconducting qubits @xcite , we call these `` optimal working points ''",
    ". the system does not show such advantages for x noise , however , which leads to temperature - independent depolarising noise .    in section [ section2 ]",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian for coupled nuclear - electronic spin systems for @xmath24 and arbitrary @xmath25 .",
    "we explain the analogy between the epr hyperfine cancellation resonances and the electron spin echo envelope modulation ( eseem ) regime of exact cancellation .",
    "we also introduce the individual resonances , describe salient features and present time - dependent calculations . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we introduce the system as a pair of coupled qubits and compare with si : p .",
    "we propose here a scheme of universal two - qubit quantum computation . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we introduce a model of decoherence caused by a temporal fluctuation of the external magnetic field , and study the effect of the cancellation resonances on the decoherence rates this model predicts .",

    "state @xmath26 is of especial significance since it , rather than the ground state , is a favourable state to initialise the system in .",

    "the @xmath138 cancellation resonance offers possibilities for more complex manipulations .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the larger state - space of si : bi may be used to store more information .",

    "@xmath165 , so its eigenvalue lies almost exactly half - way between the @xmath166 state eigenvalues : states @xmath167 , @xmath168 have energies @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "this gives the striking feature at @xmath170 ghz in fig.[fig2](b ) where the @xmath171 and @xmath172 lines coincide and where an epr pulse would simultaneously generate coherences between state @xmath26 and _ both _ states @xmath168 and @xmath173 . in effect",
    "one may use two - photon , second order processes to transfer population between states @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( recall that simultaneous spin flips are forbidden for isotropic hyperfine coupling ) .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] illustrates this .",
    "exact cancellation is a widely used `` trick '' in eseem spectroscopy .",
    "a coupled nuclear - electronic system with anisotropic hyperfine coupling , which is weak compared with electron spin frequencies ( on the mhz scale rather than ghz scale ) , has a rotating frame hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath174    here @xmath175 is the detuning from the external driving field and @xmath176 is the nuclear zeeman frequency . at resonance , @xmath177 .",
    "as the hyperfine terms are weak , terms like @xmath178 are averaged out by the rapidly oscillating ( microwave ) driving .",
    "the remaining hamiltonian @xmath179 conserves @xmath180 . for a spin @xmath181 system like si : p , the hamiltonian decouples into two separate @xmath182 hamiltonians @xmath183 . in the @xmath184 subspace ,    @xmath185    where the pauli matrices are defined relative to the basis @xmath186 while in the @xmath187 subspace : @xmath188    where the pauli matrices are defined relative to the basis @xmath189 .",
    "it is easy to see from eq.([minus ] ) that if @xmath190    only the @xmath191 term remains .",
    "this is the `` exact cancellation '' condition . while reminiscent of hyperfine cancellations resonances , there are key differences , other than the obvious one that the former occur as a series when @xmath192 in eq.([hm ] ) , while the `` exact cancellation '' occurs at a single magnetic field . in particular , since the epr cancellation resonances of eq.([hm ] ) affect both nuclear and electron spins , at @xmath192 , the eigenstates assume `` bell - like '' form : @xmath193    where the @xmath194 subscripts have been added for clarity , to indicate the electronic and nuclear states respectively .",
    "in contrast , for exact cancellation , they give superpositions of nuclear spin states only : @xmath195    which still permits interesting manipulations of the nuclear spin states @xcite .    note",
    "that , while exact cancellation eliminates the full ising term @xmath196 , the epr cancellation resonance eliminates only the non - isotropic part .",
    "in fact the epr cancellation resonances result in a variety of different types of resonances . as discussed below",
    ", the @xmath107 resonance does not cancel the hyperfine coupling at all ; it equalizes the bloch vector of the states in adjacent m - subspaces producing another effect ( the `` cancellation '' label is in this case applied in a somewhat different sense ) .",
    "epr cancellation resonances are in practice a much stronger effect than exact cancellation : decohering and perturbing effects of interest in quantum information predominantly affect the electronic spins , not the nuclear spins .",
    "exact cancellation appears in the rotating frame hamiltonian ( which contains only terms of order mhz ) .",
    "it will not survive perturbations approaching the ghz energy scale .",
    "the cancellation resonances , on the other hand , arise in the full hamiltonian , eliminate large electronic terms and can potentially thus reduce the system s sensitivity to major sources of broadening and decoherence .",
    "it is valuable to recall a major reason why the `` exact cancellation '' regime is so widely exploited in spectroscopic studies . in systems with anisotropic coupling , the spectra depend on the relative orientation of the coupling tensor and external field .",
    "thus for powder spectra , which necessarily average over many orientations , very broad spectral features result . at exact cancellation , the simplification of the hamiltonian is dramatically signalled by ultra - narrow spectral lines @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic eigenstates of the well - studied 4-state @xmath24 , @xmath13 si : p system can be mapped onto a two - qubit computational basis :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "taking the hamiltonian from eq . and adding to it a perturbative term involving independent temporal magnetic - field fluctuations in all three spatial dimensions , all of which take a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance @xmath197 , gives in the interaction picture :      we may ignore the nuclear term as its effects will be negligible . we then write the liouville - von neumann equation in differential - integral form and take the average over the field fluctuations . noting that @xmath199 we may write this as :      where assigning @xmath201 is valid as it is a hermitian operator .",
    "@xmath202 is the density operator for the nuclear - electronic system , averaged either over an ensemble of such systems , or over many repeated experiments on the same system . here",
    ", we have assumed that the field fluctuation statistics are independent of the quantum state of our system .",
    "these assumptions and approximations lead to a born - markov master equation . as @xmath203 follows a gaussian distribution with mean 0 , the first term of this equation vanishes . given that the correlation function drops to zero at finite values",
    ", we may set the integration limits to @xmath204 and @xmath205 , and change the integration constant to @xmath206 .",
    "as the temporal fluctuation takes a gaussian distribution , we may set our correlation functions to be another gaussian function of the form @xmath207    where @xmath208 is an inverse function of how fast the magnetic field fluctuates . in the limiting case of @xmath209",

    "<S> we investigate bismuth - doped silicon ( si : bi ) in the `` nuclear - electronic '' regime where the hyperfine coupling of 1.4754 ghz is comparable to the electron zeeman term in the spin hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to intermediate magnetic fields , @xmath0 t. there is growing interest in si : bi as an alternative to the well - studied proposals for silicon based quantum information processing ( qip ) using phosphorus - doped silicon ( si : p ) . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on the implications of the anomalously - strong hyperfine coupling . in particular , we analyse in detail the regime where recent 4 ghz pulsed magnetic resonance experiments have demonstrated orders of magnitude speed - up in quantum gates involving transitions which are forbidden at high fields . </S>",
    "<S> we also present calculations using a phenomenological markovian master equation which models the decoherence of the electron spin due to gaussian temporal magnetic field perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the model quantifies the advantages of certain `` optimal working points '' identified as the @xmath1 regions , which come in the form of frequency minima and maxima . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at such regions , dephasing due to the interaction of the electron spin with a fluctuating magnetic field in the @xmath2 direction ( usually adiabatic ) is completely removed . </S>"
