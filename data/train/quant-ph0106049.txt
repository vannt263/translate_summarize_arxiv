    "quantum cryptography aims to provide an _ unconditionally _ secure key distribution between two parties , alice and bob . in the first protocol proposed by bennett and brassard ( bb84 ) @xcite , to detect eavesdropping ,",
    "alice and bob choose randomly between two complementary ( conjugate ) bases and in each basis the information  is encoded using two orthogonal quantum states ( qubits ) . since the basis is unknown to the eavesdropper ( by convention called eve ) , she can not simply copy the sent states because the non - cloning theorem .",
    "the use of random complementary bases furthermore implies that if the sender alice prepares a state in one basis , the outcome of a measurement by bob or eve in a complementary basis will yield a totally random measurement outcome .",
    "these features guarantee that any eavesdropping attempt will invariably introduce errors in the transmission , which can be detected by the legitimate communicating parties .",
    "an extension to the bb84 protocol was made by bru  @xcite and by bechmann - pasquinucci and gisin @xcite to a six - state , three complementary bases protocol .",
    "the analysis shows that eve s information gain for a given impaired error rate is lower than in the bb84 protocol @xcite . very recently",
    "two other extensions were proposed where the authors have considered schemes using four states and two bases @xcite , and three states and four bases @xcite . in an earlier work we have generalized these results to encoding in @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space using @xmath1 bases @xcite where we have considered some specific and rather simple , but realistic , eavesdropping attacks .",
    "the goal of this work is to find an ultimate and practical condition for the security of quantum key distribution protocols , sufficiently general to encompass all possible types of eavesdropping .",
    "the condition we derive is given in the form of a theorem .",
    "we will also derive the upper permissible limit for bob s error rate to ensure unconditional security when eve uses incoherent and coherent eavesdropping attacks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we give a brief introduction to our protocol . in sec .",
    "3 we reiterate the secrecy capacity of a channel and derive the results for an intercept - resend eavesdropping attack . in secs . 4 and 5",
    ", we study optimal individual eavesdropping attacks , and coherent eavesdropping attacks , respectively . in sec .",
    "6 we consider realistic systems where we assume that the detector dark count probability is not negligible . finally , in sec .",
    "7 we present our conclusions .",
    "in the bb84 protocol @xcite , alice first randomly chooses between one of two bases to prepare her state , and secondly she randomly decides which of two orthogonal states in the chosen basis to send . extending this protocol to a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 , alice first chooses from which of @xmath3 complementary bases to choose her state from , and secondly she decides which of the @xmath0 orthogonal states defining the basis to send .",
    "the information  encoded by the chosen state will from hereon be denoted qunits .",
    "each symbol sent in the @xmath3 bases and @xmath0 qunits are chosen randomly with equal probability , i.e. each of the possible @xmath4 states appear with probability @xmath5 .",
    "we first define the bases @xmath6 and @xmath7 over an @xmath0-dimensional space to be _ mutually complementary _ if the inner products between all possible pairs of vectors , with one state from each basis , have the same magnitude : @xmath8 if a quantum state is prepared in the @xmath9 basis , but measured in the complementary @xmath10 basis , the outcome is completely random .",
    "wootters and fields have shown @xcite that when @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a prime and @xmath13 a positive integer , which we restrict ourselves to here , then there exist a set of @xmath14 mutually complementary bases @xcite .    to estimate the mutual information between alice and bob , alice and eve , and the information gain of the eavesdropper eve , the relevant information measure is the shannon information of the _ sifted _ symbols , i.e. , the symbols for which alice and bob have used the same bases . for simplicity",
    ", we choose to measure this information in bits . from the receiver s ( bob s or eve s ) point of view",
    ", there will be an _ a priori _ @xmath15 and an _ a posteriori _ @xmath16 probability , the latter being the conditional probability of the sending party ( alice ) having sent the symbol @xmath17 , given that the receiver ( eve or bob ) measured the result @xmath18 .",
    "the receiver s mean information gain from alice s symbol , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denote either bob or eve , equals his or her entropy decrease : @xmath21 the _ a priori _ probability for alice s symbol is uniform ( since the protocol dictates that alice must chose the symbols she sends randomly ) , leading to @xmath22 .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ entropy is defined : @xmath23 where the _ a posteriori _ probability of symbol @xmath18 given observer s result @xmath17 is given by bayes theorem : @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the mutual information between bob and alice as function of bob s error rate is obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ shannon1 ] ) and by using the symmetry properties of the protocol , i.e. , that bob s measurement errors are independent of , and uniform for , all symbols sent by alice : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is bob s error rate , i.e. , the probability that he measures a symbol erroneously . note that since expressions ( [ shannon1 ] ) and ( [ eq : info ] ) refer to the information and errors contained in the sifted symbols , these errors are due to a possible eavesdropping disturbance and system noise such as the dark counts of the detectors , the tranmission loss , etc .",
    "they are not due to bob s random choice of measurement basis .",
    "in an ideal system , after the qunit string has been transmitted , measured , and sifted , alice and bob will share a common key .",
    "however , in real systems there are always some errors , and some of these errors may be due to an eavesdropper . hence , alice and bob need to use error correction through a classical channel to establish an identical key , and privacy amplification to obtain a secret common key @xcite .",
    "the eavesdropping attacks by eve must introduce errors . as stated above this",
    "is due to alice s random choice of measurement basis and the fact that eve can not copy an unknown state perfectly . in the case of simple intercept - resend eavesdropping attacks ,",
    "eve gets one of the @xmath4 possible results .",
    "after alice and bob announced their choice of bases we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , according to ( [ shannon1 ] ) and ( [ eq : info ] ) , eve s information gain is @xmath33 and bob s error rate becomes @xmath34 when eve employs the intercept - resend eavesdropping strategy .",
    "csiszr and krner @xcite have given a lower bound for the _ secrecy capacity _ , that is , the maximum rate at which alice can reliably send random symbols to bob such that the rate at which eve obtain information about the symbols is arbitrarily small",
    ". we can give their result as a theorem , the proof of the theorem is given in @xcite .",
    "+ _ theorem 1 : _ alice and bob can establish a secret key ( using error correction and privacy amplification ) if , and only if , @xmath35 or @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mutual information between alice and bob , alice and eve , and bob and eve , respectively .",
    "+ taking the sifting , error correction , and privacy amplification into account , we can hence define an effective transmission rate as @xmath40    we will discuss in the following sections the different eavesdropping strategies and present a security analysis .",
    "first we begin by considering individual attacks where eve attaches independent probes to each qunit and measures her probes one after the other .",
    "second , we consider coherent attacks in which eve process several qunits jointly .",
    "here we discuss an individual eavesdropping strategy based on the use of an asymmetric version of the n - dimensional symmetric universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) introduced by buek and hillery @xcite .",
    "this asymmetric cloner @xcite can be used to obtain two copies of alice s quantum state that are not of the same fidelity .",
    "eve then keeps one of the copies ( typically , the bad one ) for herself , and passes the other copy ( typically , the good one ) to bob . then , after bob and alice have announced their chosen bases , eve does the same measurement as bob did , i.e. , she measures her copy in the same basis as alice and bob .",
    "therefore , on the average , she will obtain similar information as bob .",
    "the asymmetry parameter of the cloner allows her to adjust the amout of information she gained , and thereby the amount of information bob lost .",
    "the asymmetric cloner is universal , just as the uqcm @xcite , so that all input states are copied equally well ( bob s fidelity and eve s fidelity do not depend on alice s chosen state nor chosen basis ) .",
    "note that the quantum circuit that implements this asymmetric cloner is exhibited in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that , if eve makes use of such an asymmetric uqcm for eavesdropping , she should exploit the state of her copy but also that of the cloning machine ( or ancilla ) in order to extract a maximum of information on alice s quantum state . in particular , she can make a coherent measurement on the state of the cloning machine and her copy in order to infer whether she introduced an error at bob s station ( and precisely what error ) @xcite .",
    "for increasing disturbance , the fidelity @xmath41 between the sent state and the state inferred by bob ( defined on the sifted symbols ) that govern the probability that he and alice will accept the transmitted state decreases , while eve s probability of correctly guessing the symbol increases .",
    "let us analyze the situation when eve uses a @xmath0-dimensional copying machine such as described in re .",
    "if alice sends the state @xmath42 , the output state is given by : @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 ) characterize the cloner and a , b , e and m stand for alice , bob , eve and the cloning machine respectively . here , the states @xmath45 are the generalization the bell states , that is , a set of @xmath46 orthonormal maximally - entangled states of two @xmath0-dimensional systems : @xmath47 where the indices @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath44 ) label the @xmath46 states .",
    "note that , here and below , the ket labels are taken modulo @xmath0 . the operators @xmath50 , defined as latexmath:[\\[u_{m , n } = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1 } { \\rm e}^{2\\pi i ( k",
    "n / n ) }    on @xmath0-dimensional states , generalizing the pauli matrices for qubits : @xmath48 labels the `` shift '' errors ( generalizing the bit flip @xmath52 ) while @xmath49 labels the phase errors ( generalizing the phase flip @xmath53 ) . using the definition of the states @xmath54 and operators @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ nic1 ] ) can be reexpressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 which will be used in the following . tracing the output joint state as given by eq .",
    "( [ nic1 ] ) over @xmath57 and @xmath3 , it is easy to check that alice s state @xmath58 gets transformed , at bob s station , into the mixture @xmath59 thus , the state undergoes a @xmath50 error with probability @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 ) .",
    "note that @xmath62 , implying that the state is left unchanged with probability @xmath63 .",
    "the phase errors @xmath64 clearly do not play any role in the above mixture , so the fidelity for bob can be expressed as @xmath65    now , we will impose that the cloner descibed above is universal , that is @xcite @xmath66 with the normalisation relation @xmath67 where the balance @xmath68 vs @xmath69 parametrizes the asymmetry of the cloner ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 correspond to the case where bob gets all the information , whereas @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to eve getting all the information ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 so that we obtain for the cloning transformation @xmath75 where the first term in the r. h. s. corresponds to bob having no error , while the @xmath76 other terms correspond to all possible errors for bob .",
    "eve strategy is as follows .",
    "she first measure both her copy @xmath57 and the `` cloning machine '' m in the good basis ( after the chosen basis is disclosed by alice and bob ) .",
    "if the two outcomes coincide , then she knows for sure that bob has no error ( @xmath77 ) , so that the state she has is the first term in the r. h. s. of eq .",
    "( [ nic2 ] ) .",
    "otherwise , she knows bob had an error ( @xmath78 ) , and she gets one of the other terms in the r. h. s. of eq .",
    "( [ nic2 ] ) .",
    "let us consider these two cases : + ( i ) @xmath79 .",
    "the joint probability that eve obtains @xmath77 and the right value of @xmath13 is @xmath80 while the probability that she obtains @xmath77 with any other of the @xmath76 possibilities @xmath81 is @xmath82 ( ii ) @xmath83 .",
    "then , a measurement of her copy gives eve the right value of @xmath13 with certainty .",
    "thus , the joint probability that eve obtains any of the @xmath84 values of @xmath85 together with the good @xmath13 is @xmath86 the fidelity of bob is given by @xmath87 the corresponding mutual information between alice and bob is given by @xmath88 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\log(n ) + f_b\\log\\left[f_b\\right ] + ( 1-f_b)\\log\\left[\\frac{1-f_b}{n-1}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consider now the mutual information between alice and eve .",
    "conditionally on eve s measured value of @xmath48 ( i.e. , conditionally on bob s error ) , this information can be expressed as @xmath89   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "i(a{\\rm:}e|m \\neq 0 )   & = & \\log(n ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the average mutual information between alice and eve is @xmath90 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\log(n ) + \\frac{(\\alpha + \\beta)^2}{n}\\log\\left[\\frac{(\\alpha + \\beta)^2}{nf_b}\\right ] + \\frac{n - 1}{n}\\alpha^2\\log\\left[\\frac{\\alpha^2}{nf_b}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this information can also be reexpressed , using eve s fidelity , @xmath91 as @xmath92 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\log(n ) + ( f_b+f_e-1 ) \\log\\left[\\frac{f_b+f_e-1}{f_b}\\right ] +   ( 1-f_e ) \\log\\left[\\frac{1-f_e}{(n-1 ) f_b}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as shown in @xcite the maximal fidelity of copying a qunit is obtained using the uqcm .",
    "this maximal value of the fidelity correspond precisely to the fidelity of optimal incoherent eavesdropping strategy , as bechmann - pasquinucci and gisin have shown explicitly for the ( @xmath93 ) case @xcite . from the symmetry of the problem it follows that for @xmath14 , the fidelity of the optimal incoherent eavesdropping is accomplished using a uqcm .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : iabn ] , we plot the information rate @xmath94 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ rab ] ) , as a function of bob s error rate for different values of @xmath0 . for each @xmath0 , the intersection between the graphs @xmath94 and",
    "the horizontal axis correspond to the upper permissible bound for bob s error rate to enable secure key distribution .",
    "in all cases , the uqcm gives the best performance ( from the viewpoint of the eavesdropper ) so alice and bob should use the uqcm model to estimate the leakage  of information to eve when applying privacy amplification .",
    "in the previous section we have assumed only individual attacks , i.e. , that eve manipulates and performs measurements on each qunit separately . in this section",
    "we address the question : if eve manipulates several qunits coherently , means an arbitrary large but finite number of qunits .",
    "we like to stress that the length of key must be much longer than this number .",
    "what is the maximum rate of errors detected by bob that allows alice and bob to still apply error correction and privacy amplification to extract a secure key ? already in 1996 , mayers presented ideas on how to prove this bound @xcite .",
    "now several proofs exist @xcite . here",
    "we shall present the proof in form quite different from the previous ones .",
    "we present our result in the form of a theorem : + _ theorem 2 : _ in @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , two users alice and bob can establish a secret key if , and only if , bob s error rate satisfy the inequality : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is bob s error rate .    to prove this theorem we need another theorem due to hall @xcite that sets a limit on the sum of the mutual information between alice and bob and the mutual information between alice and eve : + _ theorem 3 : _ +",
    "let @xmath97 and @xmath98 be symbol observables for bob and eve , respectively , in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space such that the maximum possible overlap between any two eigenvectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 corresponding to these observables is @xmath101 .",
    "then the mutual information alice - bob and alice - eve satisfy the following inequality : @xmath102    now we are ready to prove theorem 2 .",
    "+ _ proof of theorem 2 : _ suppose alice sent a large number of qunit symbols , and that bob performed this measurement on @xmath49 qunits of them using the correct basis .",
    "the hilbert space dimension of the total sifted symbol space is thus @xmath103 .",
    "let us now re - label the bases for each of the @xmath49 qunits such that , by definition , alice used all @xmath49 times the @xmath10 basis .",
    "hence , using this re - labeling , bob s observable is the n - time tensor product @xmath104 . since eve had no way to know the correct bases ,",
    "her optimal information on the correct ones is precisely the same as her optimal information on the incorrect ones .",
    "hence , one can bound her information assuming she measures @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a complementary observable to @xmath107 .",
    "it follows that @xmath108 . by applying theorem 3",
    ", we obtain the following inequality : @xmath109 by using the inequality @xmath35 of theorem 1 and eq .",

    "the attacks presented in the previous sections assume perfect eavesdropping and measurement apparata , and a noise - free channel . in real secret key distribution systems",
    "there are several limitations : the sources can emit more than one photon , some photons never get to bob s detector ( channel loss ) , the detector quantum efficiency is limited , and the dark count probability ( counts not produced by photons ) of the detectors is not negligible .",
    "we therefore define an experimental quantum bit error rate ( qber ) for a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space where we assume that the optical noise remains negligible even for large @xmath0 and the only source of noise is the dark count of the detectors . under these assumptions the @xmath114",

    "in this work we have considered an extension of bennett s and brassard s seminal quantum key distribution protocol into a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space .",
