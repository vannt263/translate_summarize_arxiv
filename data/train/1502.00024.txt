    "the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model has been studied for many years as a model for the copper oxide planes found in high temperature superconductors . despite considerable effort@xcite",
    "the basic thermodynamic properties of this model are still not well understood .",
    "the calculation reported here investigates the entropy by means of its high temperature series calculated to 12th order in inverse temperature @xmath4 . in principle , knowing the full temperature dependence of the entropy and the value of the free energy at one temperature is sufficient to fully determine the free energy and thus all the thermodynamic properties of the model .",
    "this more general calculation is left for a future publication . in this paper our attention is restricted to the entropy per site @xmath5 and its density derivative at fixed temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 along with the constraint of no double occupancy .",
    "the high temperature series for the helmholtz free energy per site is calculated by a linked cluster expansion , taking the form @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are exact polynomials in terms of the electron density @xmath9 and the ratio of the model coupling constants @xmath10 . for the calculation reported here @xmath11 and",

    "to reach low temperatures , the series expansion for the entropy needs to be extrapolated by pad approximants . with the available 12th order series",
    "the direct extrapolation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 entropy only converges for @xmath16 .",
    "a low temperature scale remains unresolved in this calculation . to improve the convergence we can try to extract this low temperature scale by forming the series for @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the entropy of the heisenberg antiferromagnet ( found by setting @xmath19 in the @xmath0-@xmath1 entropy ) , @xmath20 is the tight - binding model entropy and the starred parameters are adjusted to produce a function @xmath21 with a simple temperature dependence that extrapolates well to low temperatures .",

    "a reasonable @xmath21 can be found by setting @xmath25 , @xmath26 and adjusting @xmath27 .    to extract @xmath28 we need to know @xmath29 which is determined by using a combination of high precision monte carlo data@xcite and series expansion results for @xmath30 .",

    "the integal is evaluated by the trapezoidal rule with step size @xmath33 and the temperature dependence of the energy is given by @xmath34 with ground state energy @xmath35@xcite . using these expressions the temperature dependence of the entropy @xmath29",

    "two temperature scales emerge from this analysis : a high temperature scale @xmath48 and a low temperature scale @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath50 the @xmath0-@xmath1 entropy crosses over to the tight - binding model entropy and all the starred parameters in eq([eq : deltas ] ) are required .",
    "a complete discussion of this more complicated fitting procedure at low @xmath9 is deferred to a future publication , though here we note to order @xmath9 the series coefficients for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model free energy are exactly the same as the tight - binding model free energy so as @xmath51 we have @xmath52 at all temperatures .",

    "a selection of the entropy data is shown in fig(2 ) , with @xmath58 plotted as a function of @xmath9 for a range of temperatures .    from the entropy data",
    "an interesting quantity to calculate is the density derivative at fixed temperature @xmath3 .",
    "this derivative has been investigated in earlier calculations@xcite , but here we have greatly improved density resolution allowing a more detailed investigation than before .",
    "the entropy initially grows upon doping away from half filling and at high temperatures the configurational entropy goes through a maximum at @xmath59 . for noninteracting systems",

    "this is an indication of correlations developing in this density and temperature range .",
    "the temperatures are too high for these to be antiferromagnetic correlations and the density and temperature ranges do nt match the pseudogap found in high temperature superconductors . for @xmath67 the entropy maximum reverses and moves back to lower densities , with the temperature dependence decreasing sharply down to @xmath68 and a low temperature tail below @xmath63 extending down to @xmath69 .",

    "in experiments@xcite on cuprate superconductors the thermopower is observed to change sign as a function of doping .",

    "further information on the correlations developing at lower temperatures in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model can be found by considering the full temperature and density dependence of @xmath70 . by the equality of the mixed partial derivatives of the free energy we also have @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the chemical potential .",

    "the spacing of the densities is @xmath77.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the low temperature positive peak in @xmath75 for @xmath78 is due to the attractive antiferromagnetic interaction between oppositely oriented spins decreasing the chemical potential at low temperatures .",
    "it costs less energy to add an electron to the system when the temperature falls below the effective spin interaction energy . for @xmath79 in fig(4 )",
    "the opposite happens : a fairly broad negative peak in @xmath75 develops .",

    "the high temperature limit of @xmath75 is positive .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of @xmath62 shows the interactions in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model are producing competing correlations .",
    "for @xmath80 antiferromagnetic fluctuations are dominant at low temperatures . for @xmath79",
    "the dominant fluctuations at low temperature are d - wave pair fluctuations as shown in ref . .",
    "for densities @xmath81 there is a crossover between the two dominant fluctuations .",
    "the different fluctuations also give very different temperature dependences to @xmath75 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic fluctuations reduce the energy needed to add an electron at low temperatures while the d - wave pair fluctuations increase the energy needed to add an electron at low temperatures .",
