    "due to the relationship between complex dentritic microstructures and the mechanical properties of welded , soldered and cast components , solidification of alloys is one of the most researched subjects in materials science .",
    "computational modeling of the solidification process has been an integral part of understanding the underlying physics that is associated with all aspects of solidification . in the past few decades ,",
    "modeling of rapid solidification and solute trapping has gained attention for its role in many modern solidification processes such as thermal spraying , spin coating and laser melting  @xcite .",
    "as the solid - liquid interface position advances at very fast rates ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) , there is substantial aberration from the equilibrium concentrations at the interface in both the solid and liquid phases .",
    "this deviation can be characterized through the segregation coefficient @xmath0 , which is defined as the ratio of the solid concentration @xmath3 to the liquid concentration @xmath4 at the interface .",
    "the increase in the segregation coefficient with increasing interface velocity @xmath5 is known as solute trapping and a complete understanding of the trapping process requires the dependence @xmath6 on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the alloy .",
    "there are three main theories of solute trapping .",
    "the most widely known is the continuous growth model ( cgm ) of aziz and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "the cgm introduces the so - called diffusive speed , @xmath7 , which is the velocity at which a solute atom can traverse the solid - liquid boundary .",
    "aziz and kaplan define this parameter as @xmath8 , where d is the diffusion coefficient in the interface region and @xmath9 is the width of the interface .",
    "according to the cgm , significant trapping occurs when the interface velocity becomes comparable to @xmath7 and the main prediction of the model in the limit of dilute concentrations is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the equilibrium segregation coefficient .",
    "notice , that the complete trapping limit given by @xmath12 is approached asymptotically as @xmath13 .",
    "the work of jackson et al  @xcitedemonstrates similar asymptotic behavior , but @xmath6 is described as a power law given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a parameter analogous to the reciprocal of @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , the work of sobolev  @xcite predicts that there is an abrupt change in the segregation coefficient at a finite velocity . in other words ,",
    "complete trapping ( @xmath12 ) occurs at a well defined velocity .",
    "their theory can be explained in terms of a `` caging '' phenomenon in the bulk liquid of the system .",
    "a solute atom spends a short amount of time ( @xmath16 pico seconds ) in a cage formed by nearest - neighbor atoms before it undergoes a random hop to another cage - like shell .",
    "if the interface velocity @xmath5 is sufficiently fast , the liquid atoms attach themselves to the solid crystal at a rate that is comparable to this short time scale . at very high velocities",
    "the atoms do not have enough time to escape their cage and they completely freeze in their location . to capture the short time scale ,",
    "sobolev modified fick s first law of diffusion by introducing the following : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relaxation time required for the flux to reach its steady - state regime .",
    "the fast atomic interactions in the liquid are incorporated into the time scale @xmath19 , which can be defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bulk liquid diffusive speed .",
    "@xmath21 describes how fast a solute atom can travel in the liquid .",
    "sobolev emphasizes that solute atoms have a finite velocity in the liquid , which differs from the aziz s model where the diffusion speed in the bulk liquid is assumed infinite .",
    "combining eq .",
    "[ sobflux ] with the conservation law @xmath22 , the diffusion equation in a steady state co - moving reference frame ( @xmath23 ) can be written as :    @xmath24    the solution of eq .",
    "[ movdiff ] for the solute concentration ahead of the interface ( @xmath25 ) is :    @xmath26 } \\bigg ) + c_{o } & v < v_{d}^{b } { \\nonumber \\\\}c(x)&=c_{o } & v \\ge v_{d}^{b } \\label{concsobsol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when @xmath27 ( interface position ) , the concentration is defined as @xmath28 . as @xmath29 ( far bulk liquid position ) ,",
    "the far field concentration is @xmath30 .",
    "the solution given by eq .",
    "[ concsobsol ] is similar to the well known solution of the concentration field in the liquid ahead of a moving interface except now the diffusion coefficient can be replaced by effective diffusion coefficient @xmath31 $ ] . for the detailed solution to eq .",
    "[ movdiff ] , the reader should consult the following references @xcite .",
    "the above model extends the aziz model eq .",
    "[ azizkv ] by substituting the diffusion coefficient with the effective one , @xmath32 , that was obtained from eq .",
    "[ concsobsol ] .",
    "therefore , the segregation coefficient in this case reaches unity when @xmath33 .",
    "the sobolev / galenko model has the following formulation :    @xmath34+v / v_{d}}{1-(v / v_{d}^{b})^{2}+v / v_{d } } & v < v_{d}^{b } { \\nonumber \\\\}k(v)&=1   & v\\ge v_{d}^{b } \\label{kvsob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as the velocity of the interface increases signifcantly , the atoms in the liquid are not able to escape from the solid back to the liquid and so they freeze in their positions as the system solidifies .",
    "in other word , the solute atoms do not have enough time to jump back to the liquid once the interface velocity equivalent to the bulk diffusive velocity , which results in complete trapping .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the sobolev description of solute trapping is an accurate one .",
    "danilov and nestler  @xcite showed that the sobolev prediction was a better fit for the experimental data on si - as alloys by kittl et al  @xcite , especially in the high velocity limit .",
    "more recently , splat cooling experiments of al - mg were performed by galenko and herlach  @xcite and the results show a change from a eutectic to super saturated solid solution at a finite velocity .",
    "furthermore , theoretical work of  @xcite shows that the interface velocity as a function of undercooling changes from a power law to a linear relationship due to complete trapping and the model shows a very good agreement with cu - ni experiments .",
    "in addition to experimental studies , early molecular dynamics ( md ) work by cook and clancy showed partitionless crystal growth ( @xmath35 ) in a leonard - jones system at a finite velocity  @xcite .",
    "recently , yang et al also showed that complete trapping does occur at finite velocity .",
    "the authors simulated a leonard - jones binary and a cu - ni eam model to show that the results hold for different systems  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the sobolev model was a better fit to their md data , while the aziz model underestimated the high velocity cases when @xmath12 .",
    "the yang et al .",
    "results confirmed complete trapping but md simulations are atomistic and can not show whether there is a need for the second time derivative in the continuum description that was suggested by sobolev  @xcite .",
    "the phase field models of wheeler et al  @xcite and echebarria el al  @xcite do not show complete trapping in the high velocity limit using the parabolic form of the dynamic equations .",
    "galenko et al modified these models to their hyperbolic form i.e. adding the second time derivative to the concentration field  @xcite .",
    "they observed that @xmath6 does indeed tend to @xmath36 , however its behavior varies depending on the phase field phenomenology they choose .",
    "in addition , the diffusion coefficient of these models is a function that can be tailored to produce different trapping behaviors .    in this paper",
    "we study solute trapping using a phase field crystal ( pfc ) alloy model with inertial dynamics .",
    "the pfc model captures the atomic scale structure analogous to md yet its diffusive time scale is of the same order as regular phase field models .",
    "also , the pfc is motivated from classical density functional theory and contains only a minimal number of parameters , which in principle , can be derived from fundamental liquid state properties through the direct correlation functions controlling the excess energy .",
    "these features are relevant to solute trapping since most of the interactions occur on the liquid side of the solid - liquid interface . moreover",
    ", changing the parameters and examining their effects on the system is rather fast compared to md .",
    "for instance , the mobility of the system can be adjusted without the need for new interatomic potential(s ) in order to see the effect of the change on the trapping behavior .",
    "the work of stefanovic et al  @xcite was the first to add a second time derivative to the pure pfc model  @xcite .",
    "they motivated the second time derivative from hydrodynamics and used the resulting kinetic equations to study the deformation and plasticity in nano - crystals .",
    "the addition of the second time derivative to a two component alloy pfc model will be discussed in the model section of this paper .",
    "the competition between inertial dynamics and mobility in both the concentration and density field dictates the trapping behavior of the solute atoms will be examined .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ model ] describes the pfc model free energy as well and the equations of motion for the density and concentration .",
    "section [ results ] presents our findings by examining the relationship between the wave terms , the mobility of the system and their effect on the concentration and density fields .",
    "we end the paper with conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "for a binary alloy system that consists of a and b atoms we start by introducing the pfc free energy functional  @xcite : @xmath37 the fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the dimensionless local number density and concentration , respectively and they can be approximated as follows : @xmath40 @xmath41 is the number density of species a ( solvent ) and @xmath42 is the density of species b ( solute ) , @xmath43 is the average density , @xmath44 is a reference liquid density , @xmath45 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath46 is the average atomic radius , which sets the length scale of the system , and @xmath47 is the temperature .",
    "the last three terms in eq .",
    "[ eldpfcalenrgy ] represent a free energy of the cahn - hilliard type  @xcite , which has been used extensively to study phase separation .",
    "@xmath48 is the dimensionless bulk modulus of the liquid and @xmath49 is the dimensionless bulk modulus of the solid , which control the energy scale of the system .",
    "following  @xcite they are expanded as follows @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the difference between the bulk moduli @xmath52 sets the temperature scale of the system . @xmath53,@xmath54 and @xmath55 are constant parameters related to the direct two point correlation functions and they can be calculated using classical density functional theory or can be fitted to phenomenological models to describe various materials properties .",
    "it is worth noting that minimization of the free energy yields hexagonal structures in 2d , bcc in 3d and a constant density profile in the liquid .",
    "the model is capable of producing two different phase diagrams , eutectic and spinodal binary systems .",
    "eq .  [ eldpfcalenrgy ] is a reasonably simple model that can be used to simulate solidification , phase segregation and elasticity / plasticity  @xcite .",
    "diffusion - controlled solidification dynamics is the pfc formalism are simulated via : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the mobilities of each atomic species .",
    "the dynamics is driven by minimizing the free energy of the system in similar fashion to the cahn - hilliard equation  @xcite .",
    "one can rewrite eqs .",
    "[ abdynamics ] in terms of the density @xmath38 and the concentration @xmath39 fields using eqs .",
    "[ ncdefs ]  @xcite :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "notice , we will neglect the effects of thermal fluctuations in all of the simulations . for substitutional diffusion we assume the mobilities of species a and b are the same , which implies that @xmath62 and the cross terms vanish from eqs .  [ ncdynamics ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , sobolev  @xcite introduces a second time derivative in concentration to capture the fast interactions in the bulk liquid . in the case of pfc alloys , stefanovic et .",
    "al considered inertial dynamics in both the concentration and density field  @xcite .",
    "they derived these as an extension of this concept in pure materials @xcite to binary alloys .",
    "equations of motion for the concentration and density in this limit are given by : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , the @xmath65 and @xmath66 coefficients are responsible for introducing two time scales in the dynamics of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath67 and @xmath68 will be shown to be important quantities that will be discussed in depth in the next section .",
    "each ratio controls the effect of atomic inertial interactions in its respective field .",
    "the simulation domain is a @xmath69 channel consisting of 4096 grid points in the ( @xmath70 ) direction normal to the solid - liquid interface and 64 grid points in the parallel direction ( @xmath71 ) . to initiate the simulation , a solid seed ( periodic density ) of @xmath72",
    "was positioned at the far left part of the simulation box while the rest of the simulation box was filled with liquid ( constant density ) .",
    "all simulations were performed with periodic boundary conditions in both the @xmath70 and the @xmath71 directions .",
    "the average concentration was set to be @xmath73 and the temperature @xmath74 . as mentioned in the introduction , the aziz model ( eq .  [ azizkv ] ) and the sobolev ( eq .  [ kvsob ] ) model",
    "are derived for the dilute limit .",
    "the parameters above are thus chosen to ensure the system has a dilute concentration of @xmath75 atoms and the average concentration is such that it lies in the solid - liquid coexistence region .",
    "simulations were done for a eutectic phase diagram shown in fig  [ fphasediagram ] .",
    "since the model only supports hexagonal symmetry in @xmath69 and the simulation box is of a rectangular shape , some stress is present in the system , which can cause a change in the equilibrium concentration . to account for this , and any numerical inaccuracies associated with analytically calculating the phase diagram",
    ", we numerically evaluated the coexistence lines that were used to conduct our simulations .",
    "analytical and numerical coexistence lines of the pfc alloy model are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fphasediagram ] ) .",
    "in particular , the black lines represent the analytical solution obtained from an amplitude expansion technique as described in  @xcite while the red lines show the the equilibrium solid / liquid concentrations obtained from the simulations .",
    "the equilibrium simulation was conducted using the simulation setup mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "increasing the system size in the @xmath71-direction relieves most of the stress in the system but a plateau is reached after roughly @xmath76 grid points , with the simulation time increasing significantly for larger systems without a considerable amount of further stress relief .",
    "the remaining discrepancy between the analytic solution and the full numerical simulation shown in fig  [ fphasediagram ] is most likely due to the approximations involved in the amplitude expansion technique .",
    "it is noted that the concentration on the left hand side of the phase diagram has a negative value , which implies the absolute value of the solidus concentration to be larger than that of the liquidus . in the pfc definition of the concentration ( eq .  [ ncdefs ] )",
    "a value of @xmath77 corresponds to an actual concentration of @xmath78 .",
    "therefore in the results presented below , we will add @xmath36 to both the solid and liquid interface compositions when reporting the segregation coefficient i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "the method of driving the solid - liquid interface employed in the current study involves the application of a linear temperature ( @xmath80 ) gradient in the direction normal to the boundary .",
    "the temperature gradient ( g ) is chosen such that the liquid phase remains above the equilibrium liquidus temperature and the solid is maintained at temperatures below the liquidus . over the course of the simulation , the gradient is translated in the @xmath70-direction at the specified velocity .",
    "some care must be taken in applying the temperature gradient .",
    "the temperature gradient choice affects the solidification transient regime , either prolonging or shortening it , depending on the steepness of temperature gradient .",
    "moreover , a temperature cap , that is , the horizontal portions of the temperature profile shown in fig  [ gradtemp ] , in the bulk must be incorporated .",
    "certain temperature caps can be used to ensure that the temperature gradient does not `` outrun '' the solid - liquid interface .",
    "if the cap is too small , the temperature of the solid is too close to the starting temperature , which gives the interface limited driving force .",
    "therefore , the temperature gradient will outrun the interface at large velocities , which causes the system to solidify isothermally . in order to pull the interface at very high velocities",
    "the interface and the solid portion of the system must be assigned lower temperature caps .",
    "additionally , the temperature cap prevents entering the ab part of the phase diagram , which causes the formation of @xmath81 and @xmath65 phases ( i.e. precipitates ) . for the purpose of this paper the temperature cap and the temperature gradient",
    "were chosen to be @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "we start the discussion of solute trapping by examining the steady - state concentration profiles . to produce a 1d concentration profile ,",
    "the concentrations are averaged in the @xmath71-direction parallel to the interface . as will be seen in the results presented below",
    ", the solute concentration profiles exhibit periodic oscillations in the solid phase on a scale of its inter - planar spacing .",
    "the periodicity in the solid part of the concentration profile is a result of the density - concentration coupling term in eq .",
    "[ eldpfcalenrgy ] .",

    "the solute accumulation ahead of the interface decreases as the velocity increases .",
    "it is clear that even in extremely fast velocities ( fig  [ concprofiles]b ) the concentration ahead of the interface is higher than the solid concentration .",
    "when the second time derivative is activated in the concentration field ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 , there is a substantial amount of trapping in the low velocity profile as illustrated in fig  [ concprofiles]c .",
    "one can define the occurrence of complete solute trapping when the liquid concentration ahead of the interface equals the averaged solid concentration through the interface .",
    "fig  [ concprofiles]d displays a concentration profile where complete trapping occurs , it is evident the solute peak ahead of the interface vanishes .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      the behavior of diffusive density dynamics in rapid solidification was examined by  @xcite using the pure pfc model of ref .",
    "they show that as the velocity of the interface increases , the difference between the solid and liquid densities decreases . they demonstrate that the density field follows an aziz type trapping , analogous to that of the concentration .",
    "they attribute this change in the density to vacancy trapping as the interface advances in rapid solidification .",
    "we observe similar behavior in the density field of the binary alloy , where in the slow velocity regime , there is a noticeable jump in the density across the the solid - liquid interface ( fig  [ concprofiles]e ) . as the the interface deviates from the local equilibrium condition at higher interface velocity , the density jump significantly drops , as shown in fig  [ concprofiles]f .",
    "the use of inertial dynamics in the pure material to examine the transition from a periodic to homogenous solution was first discussed by galenko et al  @xcite . in their work",
    ", they investigate the stability of the second order differential equation for both the swift - hohenberg and the pfc models . at low driving force ( small interface speeds )",
    ", the inertial terms can be neglected to retain a parabolic form of the dynamics , since the transition from one phase to another occurs on diffusive time scales . as the driving force increases , the inertial term in the dynamics ( hyperbolic form ) provides an extra degree of freedom to capture rapid kinetics .",
    "they compare the parabolic and hyperbolic solution for the same [ high ] driving regime and find the hyperbolic form of the equation leads to slower transition speeds .",
    "they ascribe the slowing down in the front speed to the increase in the relaxation time caused by the inertial kinetics .",
    "as the @xmath65 term increases in eq .",
    "[ wavedynamics ] , the system takes a longer time to switch to diffusive dynamics .",
    "we also simulated isothermal quench simulations ( i.e. no temperature gradient ) and similarly found that the solid - liquid interface slows down as the effect of the inertial term increases , and when @xmath89 is of order @xmath90 or higher , it was found that the interface virtually stops over the time of the simulation , leading to subsequent concentration pile up ahead of the interface , and lower solute trapping .",
    "the situation is different for the case of directional solidification used here for binary alloys , since conditions at the solid - liquid interface are driven by a temperature gradient that imposes the front velocity at steady state . in this case , for a given set of parameters in the free energy , as the pulling velocity increases the interface temperature is found to decrease i.e. slides down the temperature gradient towards its lower cap ( see fig .  [ gradtemp ] ) , effectively increasing the driving force to keep the interface moving with the imposed higher speed .",
    "it was also found that a decrease in local interface temperature occurred for a fixed interface velocity when @xmath89 was increased .",
