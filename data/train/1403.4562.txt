    "attractive bosons trapped in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic lattice @xcite-@xcite or in mesoscopic arrays @xcite-@xcite have recently received considerable attention because they provide a natural framework where schrdinger - cat states @xcite-@xcite are in principle observable .",
    "both the ground state and low - energy states of these systems , in fact , have been shown to consist of superpositions of macroscopic spatially - localized quantum states when the boson - boson interaction is sufficiently strong . meanwhile , a stimulating experimental work has made concrete the realizability of lattices with a ring geometry @xcite and the development of optical - trapping schemes for engineering mesoscopic arrays @xcite , @xcite in which feshbach resonances @xcite ensure a full control of boson - boson interaction .",
    "@xmath0 bosons in a 1d periodic @xmath1-site lattice are well described within the bose - hubbard picture by model hamiltonian @xcite , @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 obey the standard commutators @xmath8= \\delta_{mi}$ ] .",
    "the boson tunneling among the lattice potential wells and boson - boson interactions are described by means of the hopping amplitude @xmath9 and parameter @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , respectively , in the attractive ( repulsive ) case .",
    "in addition , term @xmath12 includes local potentials with well depths @xmath13 thus giving the possibility to represent disordered lattices and/or trapping potentials .",
    "if @xmath14 for each @xmath15 , the resulting system is homogeneous and features translation invariance . for @xmath16 , the relevant zero - temperature scenario has been investigated in @xcite and @xcite showing how the resulting delocalized ground state exhibits three characteristic regimes depending on the value of @xmath17 . in the strong - interaction ( si )",
    "regime , where @xmath18 , the ground state is a schrdinger cat well represented by a super - position of @xmath1 coherent states of algebra su(@xmath1 ) , each one describing the strong localization of bosons around a given lattice site .",
    "the opposite weak - interaction regime is the superfluid ( sf ) one , defined in the open interval @xmath19 @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "its ground state reduces to a single su(@xmath1 ) coherent state describing the uniform distribution of bosons in the lattice and , thus , their complete delocalization .",
    "last , for @xmath21 , the solitonlike regime features a ground state which again is a superposition of @xmath1 localized states .",
    "the latter , however , exhibit an intermediate character : their localization peaks describe boson distributions involving a significant number of lattice sites .",
    "peaks become sharper and sharper when @xmath22 .",
    "this almost ideal scenario , where translation invariance combined with the fact that @xmath23 enable schrdinger - cat states to appear , breaks up as soon as @xmath24 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the low - energy properties of model ( [ bhh ] ) and analyze , in particular , the crucial role played by a localized perturbation , a single potential well , in modifying the structure of low - energy states and the relevant spectrum .",
    "the interest for this model is supported by various motivations .",
    "first , the introduction of a local potential well is the simplest possible way to introduce a disturbance in a perfectly symmetric ring lattice characterized by translation invariance .",
    "potential @xmath25 in @xmath26 will contribute with a single term at some site @xmath27 and @xmath28 for any @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , this naive model preludes to a very realistic situation .",
    "in fact , the presence of lattice defects representable in terms of extremely weak local potentials should be viewed as an intrinsic , essentially uncontrollable , ingredient of the experimental setup .",
    "if @xmath30 , their perturbative character does not affect large - scale phenomena such as the formation of mott and sf states and thus defects can be ignored .",
    "conversely , for @xmath31 , a single , even vanishingly small , defect is able to break the system symmetry therefore preventing the formation of schrdinger cats .",
    "finally , the model with a single - site potential has the non secondary advantage to allow one the implementation of standard approximation schemes and a fully analytic study of the hamiltonian and of its energy spectrum .",
    "we show that , in the si regime and in the presence of a single potential well ( placed , for example , at @xmath32 ) with depth @xmath33 even arbitrarily small , the localization effect of bosons enables us to operate a remarkable simplification of @xmath26 .",
    "the latter reduces to a pure - hopping model including a new effective local potential whose depth is proportional to the total boson number ( and therefore is much larger than @xmath33 ) .",
    "such a new form is particularly useful since , with essentially no analytic work , @xmath26 can be separated in two commuting sub - hamiltonians one of which is intrinsically diagonal .",
    "the most interesting feature , however , concerns the sp ( single - particle ) energy spectrum obtained from the complete diagonalization of @xmath26 . depending on the choice of parameters @xmath9 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 , the spectrum exhibits a structure characterized either by well - visible energy doublets or by an almost uniform distribution of sp energies .",
    "the notable exception in the latter case is the lowest sp energy showing , for @xmath35 , an unexpected diverging behavior to arbitrarily large negative values .",
    "this feature has been already observed in the study of the sp spectrum of bosonic comb lattices @xcite and of their unusual zero - temperature properties .",
    "then we investigate the sf regime by adopting the standard bogoliubov picture to recast our @xmath36 model into a more convenient form . in this case , however , a rather hard mathematical work is necessary to diagonalize @xmath26 .",
    "to this end , after recognizing that @xmath26 can be expressed as a linear combination of the operators belonging to @xmath1 independent su(1,1)-like algebras , a remarkable help in the diagonalization process comes from exploiting the transformation properties of such algebras . also in this case , the definition of two independent sets of new bosonic modes makes @xmath26 separable into two commuting sub - hamiltonians one of which exhibits the characteristic sp energies distinguishing the solution of sf models within the bogoliubov diagonalization scheme .",
    "the sp energies of the other sub - hamiltonian ( this is written in terms of @xmath33-dependent modes ) are found to represent small deviations of bogoliubov - like sp energies .",
    "the sp spectrum is thus characterized by energy doublets .",
    "both in the si and in the sf case , we determine the analytic form of weakly excited states .",
    "sections ii and iii are devoted to the study of the si regime and the sf regime , respectively . in both sections",
    "the validity of analytic results concerning the ground state and the first few weakly - excited energy levels are compared with numerical results .",
    "section iv is devoted to final comments .",
    "low - energy states of hamiltonian ( [ bhh ] ) with @xmath37 and @xmath16 consist of a superposition of su(@xmath1 ) coherent states , each one involving a boson distribution strongly localized around a different site of the lattice .",
    "such coherent states are defined by @xmath38 where @xmath0 is the total boson number , state @xmath39 is such that @xmath40 for each @xmath15 , and the second equation defines the scalar product of two generic states .",
    "the normalization of @xmath41 is thus ensured by @xmath42 . based on the previuos definition",
    ", the explicit form of low - energy states in terms of localized states @xmath43 was found to be @xcite @xmath44 in which index @xmath45 with @xmath46 $ ] essentially represents the eigenvalue of the quasi - momentum operator generating lattice translations .",
    "the ground state corresponds to the case @xmath47 .",
    "the localization of bosons at site @xmath27 is embodied in inequality @xmath48 of formula ( [ gs1 ] ) , the quantity @xmath49 representing the fraction of population at site @xmath50 according to state @xmath43 .",
    "this feature becomes evident by reminding that @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "in addition , because states @xmath43 can be equipped with the property @xmath52 , one can prove @xcite that @xmath53 whose site independence confirms that @xmath54 are delocalized states . for @xmath55 , states @xmath56",
    "have been shown @xcite to provide a quite satisfactory approximation of the true energy eigensates whose exact form can be found only numerically .    in the ideal lattice ( @xmath37 ) the model features translation symmetry which is responsible for the super - position of equal - weight localized states in state ( [ gs1 ] ) . in the classical limit , this symmetry is broken : only one of components @xmath43 survives giving rise to the exponential localization @xcite that is known to distinguish the maximally excited state of model ( [ bhh ] ) with @xmath57 .",
    "the presence of local potential @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) in our quantum model @xmath60 with @xmath61 also breaks this symmetry suggesting that only one among the @xmath1 components of @xmath62 is expected to survive .",
    "if one assumes that the most part of the population is placed at site @xmath32 owing to the presence of the attractive well , then hamiltonian ( [ hv ] ) can be taken into a new approximate form whose diagonalization appears to be rather simple .",
    "the approximation we effect essentially coincides with the bogoliubov scheme . observing that @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 , then @xmath67 in which terms @xmath68 with @xmath69 have been suppressed .",
    "model ( [ hv ] ) thus reduces to @xmath70 in which the assumed localization at @xmath32 has the dramatic effect to involve a much deeper ( effective ) well with depth @xmath71 together with the disappearence of nonlinear interaction terms @xmath72 . therefore",
    ", even if the initial well is a simple perturbation where @xmath33 could be vanishingly small , the depth of the resulting effective well can be really large since it depends on @xmath73 .",
    "the role of attractive interaction @xmath74 @xmath75 is thus to reduce the initial model to a pure - hopping model with a deeper effective well .      after assuming hamiltonian ( [ hvo ] ) as the reference model in the si regime ,",
    "its diagonalization is performed by resorting to the momentum - mode picture @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 $ ] , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 owing to the periodic boundary conditions of the lattice .",
    "this gives @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . to achieve the diagonal form of @xmath85",
    "it is particularly advantageous to define the new operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 . in",
    "case @xmath1 is even , the further operator @xmath89 must be included while @xmath90 .",
    "the range of index @xmath91 is such that @xmath92 if @xmath1 is odd or even , respectively .",
    "note that such operators satisfy the usual bosonic commutators @xmath93 = \\delta_{nh } = [ f_n , f^+_h   ] $ ] .",

    "hamiltonian ( [ hb2ff ] ) is thus formed by two commuting parts one of which , @xmath99 , is diagonal .",
    "the remaining part , @xmath100 with @xmath101 , can be diagonalized in a rather direct way .",
    "in fact , since @xmath102 are elements of an @xmath103 real and symmetric matrix , there exists an orthogonal transformation of elements @xmath104 such that @xmath105 , @xmath106 and , in particular , @xmath107 the latter entails @xmath108 . as a result , by introducing the new bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath109 and @xmath110 , satisfying standard bosonic commutators due to the orthogonality of @xmath104 , one gets the diagonal form @xmath111 by using the previous definition of @xmath102 together with the orthogonality relations for @xmath104 , equation ( [ orthogdiag ] ) becomes @xmath112 and thus @xmath113b_{qh}\\ , = \\",

    "<S> the ground - state properties of attractive bosons trapped in a ring lattice including a single attractive potential well with an adjustable depth are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum is reconstructed both in the strong - interaction limit and in the superfluid regime within the bogoliubov picture . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results thus obtained are compared with those found numerically from the exact hamiltonian , in order to identify the regions in the parameter space where this picture is effective . </S>",
    "<S> the single potential introduced is the simplest way to break the translational symmetry and to observe , through a completely analytical approach , how the absence of symmetry affects the properties of the low - excited eigenstates of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this model gives a first insight into the properties of systems including more complex potentials . </S>"
