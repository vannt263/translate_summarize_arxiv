    "the extremely small value of the cosmological constant  at least @xmath13 orders below its natural value  has resisted explanation from symmetry principles .",
    "furthermore , since the discovery of dark energy , with @xmath14  @xcite , there appears to be a second part to the cosmological constant problem : why does it take the observed value , which is close to the matter density at the present epoch ?",
    "environmental arguments solve both pieces of the puzzle , at least at the order of magnitude level  @xcite , motivating searches for further evidence of environmental selection . while there are symmetry arguments for understanding why the weak scale is @xmath15 orders of magnitude less than its natural value in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "no direct experimental evidence for any such symmetry extension of the sm has been found so far in the preliminary exploration of the weak scale . on the other hand ,",
    "it is intriguing that if the weak scale were increased by a factor of @xmath16 , the sm would not yield any complex stable nuclei  @xcite , suggesting that the weak scale may also be selected environmentally .",
    "such arguments from environmental selection only make sense if the underlying theory of nature has a vast landscape of vacua , allowing a fine scanning of parameters .",
    "the realization that string theory , with a compact manifold of extra dimensions , may yield such a landscape  @xcite strengthens the motivation for seeking further evidence for environmental selection on a multiverse .",
    "string theory requires supersymmetry ; however , if the weak scale is environmental , it is reasonable to consider that the scale of supersymmetry breaking is high , i.e.  close to the string scale rather than to the weak scale .",
    "hence , in this paper we explore the case of very high scale supersymmetry breaking , with the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking described purely by the sm higgs boson .",
    "this appears to leave no room for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter , since no new stable particles have masses that are logically connected to weak symmetry breaking .",
    "instead , we _ assume _ that there is an environmental requirement for dark matter .",
    "this assumption now plays a central role , since it determines the properties of the dark matter and the size of the cosmological constant .",
    "in particular , we assume that dark matter arises from a conventional freezeout process through interactions with couplings that are order unity .",
    "the environmentally allowed range of the dark matter density is unknown  @xcite , but we do not need to assume that it is very narrow . even if the range spans several orders of magnitude , the selection process leads to dark matter particles having masses within an order of magnitude or two of the weak scale .",
    "however , we stress that the connection between the dark matter mass , @xmath17 , and the weak scale , @xmath18 , is now purely coincidental .",
    "our framework for high scale supersymmetry breaking , with independent environmental selections of the weak scale and dark matter , is as follows .",
    "the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the sm sector , @xmath19 , is taken close to the cutoff of the effective field theory at the string scale , @xmath20 . at @xmath19 the theory is taken to have the states of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) together with gauge singlet chiral multiplets @xmath21 .",
    "the environmental selection for dark matter requires some states beyond those of the sm to be much lighter than @xmath19 . as supersymmetry breaks near @xmath20 , the @xmath0 symmetry @xmath22",
    "must also be broken at a very high scale to cancel the cosmological constant .",
    "it is then likely that @xmath0 breaking is transmitted to the mssm sector without large suppression , making the gauginos very heavy .",
    "it is possible that such a strong transmission is avoided , leading to the split supersymmetry theory  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "environmental selection of dark matter acting on the symmetry breaking parameter of a particular @xmath0 symmetry can protect all fermionic superpartners to near the weak scale .    in this paper",
    "we explore the simple possibility that @xmath0 breaking in the mssm sector is unsuppressed . in this case , what is the origin of the small weak - scale mass needed for wimp dark matter ?",
    "environmental selection could lead either to a cancellation of terms in the mass of some particle , or to a theory with an approximate symmetry that protects some light states . in the former case dark matter",
    "would be fermionic , since for fermions the cancellation is linear in the mass , while for scalars it is quadratic . also , the dark matter sector would contain just a single fermion , since there is a cost for each cancellation .",
    "since pure higgsino dark matter is observationally excluded and a pure singlino does not freeze - out at the weak scale , in our framework the only possibility with mass cancellation is pure wino dark matter , @xmath23 . if the mass of the dark matter sector is protected by an approximate symmetry , there is again a unique possibility .",
    "since supersymmetry is broken at the high scale , the approximate symmetry can not keep scalars light . furthermore , since the approximate symmetry must be a non-@xmath0 symmetry it can not protect gauginos either , so that the only states that it can protect are the higgsinos and singlinos , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "realistic wimp dark matter requires that all three states are involved .",
    "thus with high scale breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry , we are led to two possibilities for environmental wimp dark matter : selection of a small wino mass , or selection of an approximate symmetry that protects the higgsinos and singlino .",
    "we do not know which of these possibilities has a higher probability in the multiverse .    in figure",
    "[ fig : delta ] , we illustrate how accurately gauge coupling unification occurs in these two theories compared to the sm . the quantity @xmath27 is a measure of the size of the threshold corrections needed to unify the couplings at scale @xmath28 . in all three theories unification occurs near @xmath29 .",
    "the sm and the sm  @xmath1 theory require comparable threshold corrections of @xmath30 , while sm  @xmath4 yields gauge coupling unification that is almost as precise as in the mssm  @xcite .",
    "since gauge coupling unification occurs at a scale @xmath31 , suppression of gauge - mediated proton decay suggests unification into higher dimensions  @xcite , which can bring gauge coupling unification for the sm  @xmath4 theory to an even higher level of precision  @xcite .",
    "we study both these theories in this paper ; various aspects of the sm  @xmath4 theory and its signals are explored in sections  [ sec : model ]    [ sec : signals ] , and wino dark matter in the sm  @xmath1 theory is examined in section  [ sec : wino ] .    in previous studies of mixed doublet / singlet fermion",
    "dark matter inspired by an environmental weak scale , the theory studied was the most general allowed for the doublet / singlet system  @xcite .",
    "the higgsino / singlino dark matter theory studied in this paper is a new version , which emerges from the supersymmetric framework described above and keeps the successful features of gauge coupling unification and wimp dark matter .",
    "supersymmetry plays a key role since it leads to a high precision prediction for the higgs boson mass , and it restricts the form of the yukawa couplings to the new states . in this sm",
    "@xmath4 theory , the higgsino mass , @xmath32 , transforms non - trivially under some approximate symmetry @xmath33 and , since @xmath33 is not an @xmath0 symmetry , the higgs - boson mass mixing parameter , @xmath34 , must also be suppressed : @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a small symmetry breaking parameter .",
    "this implies that environmental selection on the higgs mass matrix to obtain a low weak scale leads to the light higgs boson being @xmath38 or @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "the heavy top quark prefers the former case , so that quark and charged lepton masses arise from @xmath41_{\\theta^2 }       + \\frac{1}{m_*^2 } [ ( qd + le ) h_u^\\dagger x^\\dagger]_{\\theta^4 }       + { \\rm h.c . } , \\label{eq : sm - yukawa}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 are the quark and lepton superfields , @xmath43 a higgs superfield and @xmath44 a superfield that leads to supersymmetry breaking , @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "hence the @xmath47 quark and @xmath48 lepton masses are moderately suppressed relative to the @xmath49 quark mass by supersymmetry breaking , @xmath50 .    as in the mssm",
    ", supersymmetry imposes a boundary condition on the higgs quartic coupling , but with two important differences .",
    "first , the boundary condition applies near the unified scale rather than near the weak scale and , as we will see in section  [ sec : higgs ] , this has crucial consequences for the prediction of the higgs boson mass .",
    "secondly , since @xmath51 , the boundary condition becomes independent of @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 results from threshold corrections , for example , from integrating out superpartners such as the top squarks .",
    "since @xmath26 is lighter than @xmath19 , the superfield @xmath21 must also transform non - trivially under @xmath33 .",
    "this removes interactions that transform linearly in @xmath21 , such as @xmath55_{\\theta^4}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath33 charges must allow @xmath56_{\\theta^2}$ ] , since otherwise @xmath26 would not interact in the low energy theory , preventing acceptable dark matter .",
    "hence the theory below @xmath19 is described by @xmath57 where we drop higher dimension interactions and dimensionless interactions suppressed by powers of @xmath37 .",
    "supersymmetry together with @xmath33 removes the gauge invariant interaction @xmath58 , so that there are just three new parameters : @xmath59 and @xmath5 . since the quartic coupling is predicted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdabc ] ) , the theory has just two more free parameters than the sm .    in the next section we present a particular realization of our sm  @xmath4 theory , with @xmath60 . in section  [ sec : higgs ] we present the higgs mass prediction , finding that it is extremely insensitive to @xmath5 for @xmath61 .",
    "the constraints on the parameter space imposed by the requirement of dark matter are studied in section  [ sec : dm ] . in section  [ sec : signals ] we study experimental signals from hadron colliders and from the direct and indirect detection of dark matter .",
    "in section  [ sec : wino ] we study wino dark matter in the sm  @xmath1 theory .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section we present a model that realizes the framework where dark matter is protected by a chiral symmetry @xmath33 .",
    "we consider that the theory above @xmath19 is the mssm with a singlet superfield @xmath21 .",
    "we also assume that the theory possesses usual @xmath0 parity , under which @xmath21 is even , and that supersymmetry breaking does not violate @xmath33 so that the protection of dark matter persists below @xmath19 .",
    "this implies that the supersymmetry breaking field @xmath44 is neutral under @xmath33 .",
    "we consider that the higgsinos and singlino obtain masses in the same way via a single symmetry breaking spurion @xmath37 : @xmath62_{\\theta^2}$ ] .",
    "we also require that the yukawa coupling @xmath56_{\\theta^2}$ ] exists , allowing the higgsinos to mix with the singlino .",
    "we then find , using the freedom of redefining @xmath33 charges through hypercharge , that @xmath60 is the unique possibility under which @xmath43 , @xmath63 , and @xmath21 , as well as the symmetry breaking spurion @xmath37 , all carry a charge of @xmath64 . the existence of the yukawa couplings of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sm - yukawa ] ) then implies that the charge of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are @xmath68 , @xmath64 , and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the most general charge assignment under @xmath33 is thus given as in table  [ tab : z_3 ] .",
    ".the charge assignment under @xmath60 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are arbitrary numbers . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the precision measurement of the higgs mass at lhc is particularly important , since the theoretical prediction of @xmath71 is only evaded in theory  iii with large @xmath5 , or in theories  i and ii if @xmath52 is relevant .",
    "a precise measurement near @xmath6 would by itself provide significant evidence for a very high supersymmetry breaking scale , no matter what the underlying theory . if the higgs mass lies above this special number by more than the uncertainties arising from the experimental errors in the top quark mass and qcd coupling , theories  i and ii will both be excluded .",
    "a higgs mass in the window @xmath72 would be suggestive of theory  i or ii , while a value above @xmath6 , but below @xmath7 , would accurately determine @xmath5 in theory  iii .",
    "the indirect detection of dark matter from annihilations to @xmath73 at the galactic center will provide a crucial measurement . a large signal at a planned atmospheric cerenkov telescope corresponding to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , when combined with a higgs mass measurement in the window @xmath3 , would provide strong evidence for theory  ii .",
    "this would be compelling for a higgs mass at the upper end of the window , implying @xmath76  orders of magnitude fine - tuning .",
    "for theory  iii , figure  [ fig : photon - scan ] shows that , for a wide range of dark matter masses , @xmath77 , a monochromatic photon signal from the galactic center should be seen with @xmath78 . except for very small regions of parameter space at low @xmath17 and low @xmath5 , a smaller value of @xmath79 only occurs at large @xmath5 , and this must be correlated with a heavy higgs .",
    "thus the combination of the higgs mass and monochromatic photon measurements serves to essentially distinguish the three theories .",
    "further discrimination between the theories is provided by direct detection of dark matter .",
    "figure  [ fig : dd - scan ] shows that in theory  iii with @xmath80 a signal with @xmath81 is expected for any value of @xmath5 . while none of the signal region is presently excluded , much is within reach of xenon  100 kg and lux  300 kg .",
    "theory  ii predicts @xmath82 and , since @xmath83 , experiments beyond xenon  100 kg and lux  300 kg will be needed .    in theories",
    "i and ii there is no possibility of any signal of new physics beyond the sm higgs at the lhc . a trilepton signal for theory  iii is possible , and the most favorable region of parameter space is low @xmath32 and @xmath84 and also low @xmath5 .",
    "however , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath85 , the number of signal events is at most of order @xmath86 , and the background is about a factor @xmath87 larger , so that even in this favorable case it is not clear that @xmath5 can be extracted sufficiently accurately to allow a precise correlation with the higgs mass . for theory",
    "iii a precise determination of parameters via the higgsino / singlino masses and couplings would require a linear @xmath88 collider . if the dark matter mass is approaching @xmath89 , a muon collider may be more effective .    while a higgs mass near @xmath6 would point towards theory  i",
    ", it would become convincing only after excluding theories  ii and iii .",
    "the absence of an indirect detection @xmath90 signal with @xmath91 at @xmath2 would clearly exclude theory  ii . for theory  iii , the absence of a direct detection signal with @xmath92 would essentially exclude @xmath93 .",
    "theory  iii with @xmath94 , the case of dominant higgsino dark matter , would be excluded by the absence of an indirect @xmath90 signal with @xmath95 , while that with @xmath96 may be within the reach of the lhc .",
    "the main theoretical motivation for the lhc is to uncover the physics behind the weak scale by discovering new particles beyond the sm .",
    "however , this motivation assumes that the weak scale is naturally related to some other mass scale , such as the scale of some new strong force or of supersymmetry breaking , without any fine - tuning .",
    "if the weak scale arises from environmental selection on a multiverse , the most significant evidence from the lhc may lie in the value of the higgs boson mass .",
    "combining this with results from the direct and indirect detection of galactic dark matter could convincingly uncover the nature of the weak scale theory , providing strong evidence for both the multiverse and supersymmetry at unified scales .",

    "<S> taking a broader view , allowing the possibility of @xmath0 symmetry protection to the tev scale or axion dark matter , we find four more theories : ( sm  +  axion ) , two versions of split supersymmetry , and the e - mssm , where a little supersymmetric hierarchy is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> the special higgs mass value of @xmath8 appears in symmetry limits of three of the six theories , ( sm  +  axion ) , ( sm  @xmath1 ) and ( sm  @xmath9 , motivating a comparison of other signals of these three theories .    </S>",
