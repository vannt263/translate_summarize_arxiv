    "quantum optics deals with the interaction of matter and electromagnetic waves in regimes where the granularity of light comes into play . typically , because both the fine structure constant and atomic dipoles are small , matter - light coupling is weak , allowing treatment by simple and controlled methodologies , such as the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , born - markov schemes , and fock space truncation  @xcite",
    "however , recent artificial systems such as superconducting waveguides  @xcite , especially the ones using josephson junction elements to boost the circuit impedance   @xcite , constitute metamaterials where charge density fluctuations mimic an optical - like medium in which the coupling to matter ( namely superconducting qubits ) can be ultra strong . in this situation , a plethora of interesting phenomena , such as wide - band frequency conversion  @xcite , large non - linearities  @xcite , and non - trivial many - body vacua  @xcite , have been theoretically predicted .    in this context , the standard theoretical approaches mentioned above are insufficient : born - markov schemes are clearly violated by the large coupling constant , and counter - rotating terms can not be neglected anymore .",
    "in addition , a brute force fock truncation of the full hilbert space becomes numerically prohibitive due to the large number of photons generated in the environment , unless one can target physical states using an optimal variational basis , such as matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite or within the systematic coherent state expansion ( cse ) pioneered in ref .   and susequently extended to a variety of dissipative models  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we probe the idea that multi - mode coherent states are a well - adapted tool to deal with ultra - strong coupling quantum optics by investigating in depth several dynamical properties that are experimentally relevant , such as population decay , coherence buildup , and photon scattering in a large - impedance superconducting waveguide .",
    "historically , this approximate single - coherent state approach was devised for the ground state of the spin - boson model by luther and emery  @xcite and subsequently by silbey and harris  @xcite and other authors  @xcite , before the demonstration that it can be turned into a systematic expansion that allows one to reach the exact many - body ground state for any coupling strength  @xcite and an arbitrary bath spectral density  @xcite .",
    "starting down this same route , we study quantum dynamics here only at the simplest silbey - harris level , thus using a single variational coherent state as a lowest order approximation for the time - dependent problem ( this is also called the davidov ansatz ) . such an approach has been previously applied to study quantum dynamics for a variety of physical problems  @xcite , and it can be adapted to address scattering of fock states  @xcite .",
    "the present study allows us to thoroughly assess the merits and drawbacks of this very economical approach ; the numerically - exact full generalization of the systematic cse to the time domain will be addressed in subsequent work .",
    "we will demonstrate here that this simple - minded single coherent state approach already contains most of the physics at play and naturally bridges from the weak to ultra - strong coupling regimes .",
    "indeed , population decay is found to cross over from underdamped to overdamped relaxation at increasing environmental impedance , as expected physically  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this single - coherent state approximation predicts elastic transmission lineshapes beyond the rwa that in the linear response regime match precisely our non - perturbative calculations using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) .",
    "these simulations are used to derive simple and accurate analytical formulas for the transmission coefficients and total inelastic deficits , that can then be used to compare to experiments in waveguide qed .    however , we point out some shortcomings of the single coherent state dynamics that were not reported so far in the literature .",
    "artifacts are indeed generically found whenever the two - level system is subject to a strong temporal perturbation , such as a quantum quench or a strong irradiation pulse ( beyond the linear response regime ) . in all these cases , relaxation is found towards an incorrect steady state where long range correlations are spuriously maintained between the two - level system and modes propagating away from it .",
    "these artifacts are a consequence of the constrained form of the single coherent state ansatz , which neglects entanglement within the bath states at all times , and are likely to be cured by extending the present technique to a dynamical version of the systematic coherent state expansion  @xcite .",

    "we relate this to artifacts in the bath dynamics .",

    "this renormalization effect is , however , well - described by an alternative approach , where the dressing of the qubit levels occurs via coherent states  @xcite . at the lowest degree of approximation , a single multimode coherent state is introduced for each qubit state , so that the time - dependent state vector takes the form of the following simple ansatz : @xmath13 } { \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle}\\\\ \\nonumber & & + q(t ) { \\left| { \\downarrow}\\right\\rangle } e^{\\sum_k [ h_k(t ) { a^{e\\dagger}_{k}}- h_h^*(t){a^{e\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{k } } ] } { \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the time - dependent amplitudes of the dressed qubit states ( and map the entire bloch sphere ) , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote complex displacements of the associated bath oscillators dressing the qubit .",

    "is performed , the output must be analyzed . because of the constrained ansatz  ( [ psi ] ) , the output is again a single coherent state , but one has to recombine the even sector output with the odd sector trivial evolution .",
    "after a long enough time @xmath137 so that the outgoing wavepacket is disentangled from the silbey - harris cloud , one obtains the total displacement @xmath138 , separating into the ground state contribution and an outgoing scattering part . combining with @xmath139 using eq .",

    "one can then define transmission and reflection coefficients as the ratio of the outgoing ( in each possible terminal ) to the ingoing power : @xmath141      , the reflection coefficient obtained from the variational dynamics ( symbols ) matches the rwa lineshape ( dashed line ) , which was however corrected with the proper renormalized qubit splitting .",
    "parameters here are @xmath142 and the variational dynamics is done at weak power ( @xmath143 ) in order to be in the linear response regime .",

    "[ coherentstatetransmissionsmallalpha ] for @xmath145 and an incident coherent state wavepacket whose intensity is small .",
    "we see excellent agreement between the two methods ; thus , the coherent state approach performs very well in the quantum optics regime [ note that an effective qubit splitting was added by hand in the rwa curve ] .",
    "increasing dissipation up to @xmath46 , we assess the validity of both the coherent state dynamics and the rwa by comparing to the numerically exact nrg results in fig .",
    "[ coherentstatetransmissionlargealpha ] .",
    "while the rwa results are rather inaccurate , the coherent state dynamics is in excellent agreement with the nrg , showing its utility well beyond the usual quantum optics regime .     and @xmath146 for increasing irradiation power .",
    "the incident power is characterized by the average number of photons @xmath114 in the incoming coherent state wavepackets ; results for up to @xmath147 are shown . ]    being a non - equilibrium method , the coherent state dynamics can access regimes beyond linear response , which the present formulation of the nrg is not able to achieve .",

    "having checked our numerical integration carefully , we attribute the large level of noise in these results to the restricted form of the ansatz  ( [ psi ] ) and not to numerical inaccuracies .",
    "this is consistent with our general observation that artifacts typically arise for strong temporal perturbations in the single coherent state dynamics , which indeed increase at larger power .",
    "the general trend of the curves are however clear  @xcite : due to saturation effects of the two - level system by the large flux of photons , the reflection is reduced at increasing power .",
    "clear deviations from the linear response result occur for an average photon number @xmath148 .",
    "this value can be understood from the fact that the qubit excitation rate @xmath149 becomes then comparable to the qubit decay rate @xmath150 .",
    "saturation effects are indeed expected to be governed by the renormalized qubit frequency at strong coupling .",
    "we have investigated here the relaxation and transport properties of a single qubit side - coupled to a large impedance transmission line , using complementary many - body methods .",
    "the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) allowed us to accurately compute the linear - response transport coefficients , and showed good agreement for a simpler approach using the variational time - evolution of a wavefunction based on a single coherent state .",
    "this coherent state dynamics was benchmarked also regarding relaxation properties , and despite some success in predicting the onset of overdamped dynamics , showed some physical artifacts such as improper relaxation to the correct steady state .",
