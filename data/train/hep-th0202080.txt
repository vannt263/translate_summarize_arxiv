    "since the publication of the pioneering papers of calogero  @xcite and sutherland  @xcite , the study of solvable and integrable quantum many - body problems has become a fruitful field of research with multiple connections in many branches of contemporary mathematics and physics . from a mathematical standpoint ,",
    "one of the key developments in the field was the discovery by olshanetsky and perelomov of an underlying @xmath1 root system structure for both the calogero and sutherland models  @xcite .",
    "the integrability of these models follows by expressing the hamiltonian as one of the radial parts of the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator in a symmetric space associated with the given root system .",
    "it was also shown in this paper that the original inverse square ( calogero ) and trigonometric / hyperbolic ( sutherland ) potentials arise as appropriate limits of the most general potential in this class , given by the weierstrass @xmath2-function , and that integrable models associated to other root systems also exist . the rational and trigonometric calogero ",
    "sutherland ( cs ) models are also _ exactly solvable _ , in the sense that their eigenfunctions and eigenvalues can be computed algebraically .",
    "in fact , the study of the eigenfunctions of these models has led to significant advances in the theory of multivariate orthogonal polynomials  @xcite .",
    "apart from their mathematical interest , cs models have found numerous applications in diverse areas of physics such as soliton theory  @xcite , fractional statistics and anyons  @xcite , random matrix theory  @xcite , and yang ",
    "mills theories  @xcite , to name only a few .    during the last decade ,",
    "cs models with internal degrees of freedom have been actively explored by a variety of methods , including the exchange operator formalism  @xcite , the dunkl operators approach  @xcite , reduction by discrete symmetries  @xcite , and construction of lax pairs  @xcite .",
    "historically , the first cs models with spin discussed in the literature were related to the original models of @xmath1 type introduced by calogero and sutherland  @xcite .",
    "the integrability of these cs spin models was established in some cases by relating the hamiltonian to a quadratic combination of dunkl operators of @xmath1 type  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 counterpart of the @xmath1 cs spin models mentioned above were first considered by yamomoto  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the spectrum of the rational @xmath0 spin model was explicitly determined , and its integrability was shown by means of the lax pair approach . in ref .",
    "@xcite , yamamoto and tsuchiya presented an alternative proof of the integrability of this model using dunkl operators of @xmath0 type .",
    "the same operators were later employed by dunkl to construct a complete basis of eigenfunctions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the trigonometric / hyperbolic @xmath0 spin model has received remarkably little attention . in our recent paper  @xcite we proved that this model is exactly solvable in the sense of turbiner  @xcite , meaning that its hamiltonian leaves invariant a known infinite increasing sequence ( or _ flag _ ) of finite - dimensional linear spaces of smooth spin functions .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we developed a systematic method for constructing exactly ( or in some cases partially ) solvable @xmath0-type cs models with spin by combining several families of dunkl operators .",
    "the key elements of this method first introduced in the @xmath1 case in @xcite are : i ) the definition of a new family of dunkl operators , and ii ) the construction of a very wide class of quadratic combinations of these operators and those in the other two families considered by dunkl in  @xcite .",
    "the interest on cs spin models has been further enhanced by their close connections with integrable spin chains of haldane  shastry type  @xcite .",
    "spin chains describe a fixed arrangement of particles that interact through their spins .",
    "a well - known example is the heisenberg spin chain , whose spins are equally spaced and interact only with their nearest neighbors .",
    "the haldane ",
    "shastry model was actually the first one - dimensional spin chain with long range interactions whose spectrum could be computed exactly . in this model , the spin sites",
    "are equally spaced in a circle and interact with each other with strength decreasing as the inverse square of the chord distance between the sites .",
    "the integrability of the haldane ",
    "shastry spin chain was proved by fowler and minahan in  @xcite .",
    "polychronakos later realized that the commuting conserved quantities of the haldane ",
    "shastry spin chain can be elegantly deduced from those of the ( dynamical ) sutherland spin model of @xmath1 type by applying what he called the `` freezing trick ''  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to taking the strong coupling limit in the sutherland spin model and restricting to states with no momentum excitations , so that the internal degrees of freedom remain the only relevant variables in the problem and the particles are `` frozen '' at their classical equilibrium positions .",
    "this observation is , in principle , valid for any integrable spin calogero  sutherland model .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the freezing trick is applied to the spin calogero model with rational interaction to construct a new integrable spin chain of rational type in which the sites are no longer equally spaced .",
    "the spectrum of this chain was later calculated by frahm  @xcite and polychronakos  @xcite .",
    "bernard , pasquier and serban  @xcite studied the spin chain associated with the trigonometric sutherland model , establishing its integrability for certain values of the parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold . in the first place",
    ", we prove the integrability of the hyperbolic sutherland spin model of @xmath0 type , from which we are also able to deduce the integrability of the spin chain associated with this model .",
    "secondly , we give an explicit formula for the eigenvalues of the dynamical model whose corresponding ( square - integrable ) eigenfunctions lie in the invariant flag mentioned above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ integrability ]",
    "we introduce a family of commuting dunkl operators of @xmath0 type .",
    "we show that the sums of even powers of these dunkl operators generate a complete set of commuting integrals of motion of the hamiltonian of the model .",
    "the commutation relations satisfied by the dunkl operators and the usual permutation and sign reversing operators , which possess a richer structure than in the rational case , play a key role in the proof of this result . in section  [ spectrum ]",
    "we analyze the spectrum of the hamiltonian for any value of the spin .",
    "our analysis is based on the fact that the dunkl operators leave invariant a flag of finite - dimensional linear spaces of smooth scalar functions .",
    "this flag yields a corresponding invariant flag of smooth spin functions for the hyperbolic @xmath0 sutherland hamiltonian .",
    "we construct a partially ordered basis of this  spin \" flag in which the hamiltonian is represented by a triangular matrix . in this way we can explicitly compute the eigenvalues of the restriction of the hamiltonian to the ( finite - dimensional ) intersection of the spin flag with the hilbert space of the system .",
    "we shall use the term _ algebraic _ in what follows to refer to the these eigenvalues and its corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "it remains an open problem to determine whether the algebraic sector of the spectrum actually coincides with the discrete spectrum .",
    "we also study in detail the ( algebraic ) ground state , determining its degeneracy for all values of the spin . in section [ chain ]",
    "we define the spin chain associated with the hyperbolic sutherland spin model of @xmath0 type , and apply the freezing trick to derive a complete family of commuting integrals of motion of this chain .",
    "the hamiltonian of the _ hyperbolic @xmath0 sutherland spin model _ is defined by @xmath3\\\\ & { } + b\\,\\sum_i \\sinh^{-2}\\!x_i\\,(b+s_i ) -b'\\,\\sum_i \\cosh^{-2}\\!x_i\\,\\big(b'+s_i\\big)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are real parameters .",
    "here and in what follows , any summation or product index without an explicit range will be understood to run from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , unless otherwise constrained .",
    "the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 in eq .",
    "act on the finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath10 associated to the particles internal degrees of freedom , as follows : @xmath11 we have also used the customary notation @xmath12 .    the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 are represented in @xmath13 by @xmath14-dimensional hermitian matrices , and obey the following algebraic relations : @xmath15 where the indices @xmath16 take distinct values in the range @xmath17 .",
    "the algebra @xmath18 generated by the operators @xmath19 is thus isomorphic to the group algebra of the weyl group @xmath20 of type @xmath0 , also known as the hyperoctahedral group .",
    "we shall also make use of the permutation operators @xmath21 and the sign reversing operators @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , whose action on a function @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , is defined as follows : @xmath26 the operators @xmath27 and @xmath22 obey algebraic identities analogous to .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath28 the algebra generated by the coordinate permutation and sign changing operators @xmath27 and @xmath22 .",
    "note also that the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 generate an algebra @xmath31 isomorphic to @xmath32 and @xmath18 .",
    "from now on we shall identify the abstract group @xmath20 with its realizations generated by the operators @xmath33 on @xmath34 , @xmath35 on @xmath13 , or @xmath36 on @xmath37 , depending on the context .",
    "the hamiltonian describes a system of @xmath7 identical particles , whose physical states are therefore either totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric under particle exchange .",
    "moreover , since @xmath38 clearly commutes with the family of commuting operators @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , we can choose a basis of common eigenfunctions of @xmath38 and all the operators @xmath39 .",
    "given an element @xmath41 of this basis , it follows from the commutation relations of the sign reversing operators @xmath39 with the permutation operators @xmath42 that @xmath43 , independently of @xmath44 . in principle , the parity @xmath45 could depend on @xmath46 .",
    "however , we shall see in the following section that all the algebraic eigenfunctions have the same parity , and that this parity is determined by the sign of the parameter @xmath47 . from now on we shall assume , for definiteness , that we are dealing with a system of fermions whose algebraic states are also antisymmetric under sign reversal of each particle s spatial and internal coordinates .",
    "this covers what is perhaps the physically most interesting case , namely that of a system of spin @xmath48 particles , for which the internal degrees of freedom are naturally interpreted as the particles spin .",
    "the results of this paper can be easily modified to treat any other choice of the particles statistics and parity .    in the rest of this section we shall prove the integrability of the model by expressing the hamiltonian in terms of the following family of @xmath0-type dunkl operators : @xmath49\\\\ -\\big[b\\,(1+\\coth x_i)+b'\\,(1+\\tanh x_i)\\big]k_i+2a\\sum_{j < i}k_{ij}\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",

    "@xcite satisfy the latter equations with the right - hand side replaced by zero .",
    "the nonvanishing of the right - hand side of eqs .",
    " gives rise to some nontrivial technical points in the proof of the integrability of the hamiltonian , as we shall see below .",
    "another important property of the dunkl operators",
    "@xmath51 is that they preserve the linear space @xmath56 where @xmath57 for any nonnegative integer @xmath58 .",
