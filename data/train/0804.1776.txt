    "trapping and sticking are important processes that occur in gas - surface interactions .",
    "sticking is generally associated with strong chemical bonding to the surface and once bound the stuck particle does not desorb . trapping , on the other hand ,",
    "is associated with the physisorption potential well created by the relatively weak van der walls potential and in many circumstances trapped gas particles will desorb after a period of residing in the well near the surface .",
    "maxwell , in his studies of gas - surface interactions , is credited with being the first to invoke the simple assumption that a gas impinging on a surface is scattered into two fractions , one that reflects specularly and exchanges no energy and the other that equilibrates or accommodates completely and desorbs with an equilibrium distribution .",
    "@xcite this idea was taken up early in the twentieth century by knudsen who introduced the concept of the term  coefficient of thermal accommodation \" to measure the efficiency of energy exchange at the interface between a gas and a surface and developed a theoretical framework in which to describe it .",
    "@xcite since this early work it has become standard to assume in gas - surface collisions that the fraction of the incident gas beam that is trapped and subsequently desorbed leaves the surface in an equilibrium distribution , i.e. , its accommodation coefficient is assumed to be unity and its distribution function is the knudsen flux .",
    "this assumption of maxwell appears to be very useful because it appears to explain qualitatively experimental results measured under a wide range of different conditions , however , such an assumption has never been adequately verified theoretically .",
    "in fact , it is clear that the first part of the maxwell assumption , i.e. , that the direct scattering contribution is elastic can hold strictly true only in the case of quantum mechanical conditions which implies low energies , small temperatures and small mass ratios . for classical scattering , which is the regime of large energies , high temperatures and large mass ratios",
    "the direct scattering contribution leaves the surface as a distribution over a range of energies whose average is typically smaller than the energy of the incident beam , but may be larger in the case of high surface temperatures .",
    "@xcite however , the second part of the maxwell assumption , i.e. , that the trapping - desorption fraction leaves the surface in equilibrium , is often still today used to explain experiments .",
    "@xcite    the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we test the maxwell assumption of equilibrium for the trapping - desorption fraction using realistic calculations for a simple model of the gas - surface potential and determine when such an assumption is valid .",
    "second , we demonstrate that a model of the interaction potential that retains the basic elements necessary for trapping , when combined with a calculation that contains correct statistical mechanics , can explain modern high - precision energy - resolved scattering measurements .",
    "the gas projectile is taken to be an atom and its interaction potential is taken to be an attractive square well with a strongly repulsive surface barrier .",
    "the calculations are carried out using classical mechanics , which is justified for many systems of interest in rarefied surface dynamics .",
    "a classical treatment means that the results will describe heavy mass atoms at higher energies and surfaces at high temperatures where quantum mechanical effects are not dominant .",
    "the use of an attractive square well to approximate the slowly - varying van der waals potential is also reasonable when used with a classical calculation since it gives a good description of the two primary effects upon entering the well which are an increase in energy and a refraction of the atom to steeper angles toward the surface .",
    "the authors have earlier presented results using a similar model for one - dimensional scattering .",
    "this work extends those earlier results to the much more realistic and more complicated case of fully three - dimensional scattering .",
    "@xcite    once a beam of incoming atoms interacts with the surface , a fraction will be directly scattered while the remainder will be trapped in the potential well .",
    "of the trapped fraction , some will lose sufficient energy to be actually trapped in the well with negative total energy while others , even though they have positive total energy , will scatter at angles sufficiently close to grazing that they will be deflected back towards the surface by the attractive part of the well .",
    "this latter positive energy part of the trapped particles is often called the chattering fraction .",
    "the trapped portion of the incident beam particles will continue to have interactions with the surface and with each subsequent interaction some will receive enough energy and will be projected sufficiently close to the surface normal that they can escape , while the remainder will continue to be trapped .",
    "eventually , in a closed system , all particles initially trapped will ultimately desorb from the surface , although for low temperatures and deep potential wells this could take a very large time .    for the model considered here , through an iterative algorithm ,",
    "all of the trapped particles are followed as they continue to have collisions with the surface , and at each iteration the negative energy fraction , the chattering fraction , and that fraction which is desorbed is recalculated . in this manner the energy distribution of the slowly diminishing trapped particle fraction as well as the energy and angular distribution of the desorbed ( or scattered ) particles can be followed , and a trapping time can be calculated . by following the initial direct scattering and the sum of all the subsequently desorbed particles the approach to equilibrium of the trapping - desorption fraction can be monitored .",
    "what is determined is that for shallow potential wells and large surface temperatures , conditions for which little trapping is expected , the desorbed fraction leaves the surface very quickly and does not at all resemble an equilibrium knudsen flux .",
    "however , for deeper wells and lower temperatures when the majority of the incident particles are trapped , it is found that the energy distribution of the trapped fraction rather quickly saturates to a stable functional form while the total number of trapped particles slowly diminishes . as a function of initial conditions favorable to trapping , e.g. , low incident beam energy , deep wells and low surface temperatures , the approach of the scattered particles towards an equilibrium distribution is followed .",
    "we find that in many circumstances , the energy distribution of the scattered particles readily approaches equilibrium shape even for trapping times that are relatively short .",
    "the approach of the angular distribution to equilibrium shape , which is a knudsen cosine distribution independent of azimuthal angle , occurs more slowly and only for very large trapping times .",
    "thus this work provides a real prediction for the conditions under which the maxwell assumption of equilibrium for the trapping - desorption fraction can be applied with reasonable accuracy .    however , the mere fact that these calculations can indicate the conditions under which the trapping - desorption fraction may appear as a nearly equilibrium distribution is not sufficient to demonstrate that such conditions are realistic . in order to be convincing , calculations with the same potential model should be capable of explaining real experimental measurements . to demonstrate this ability , we have chosen to compare our calculations with recent high - precision energy - resolved data for the scattering of ar atoms from a well - ordered monolayer of the polymer 1-decanethiol adsorbed on au(001 ) .",
    "@xcite this experiment showed that for well - defined beams of ar incident over a large range of energies and angles the scattered distributions could be described by a combination of two features , a direct scattering fraction and a trapping - desorption fraction that was nearly in equilibrium with the surface .",
    "our calculations provide an excellent description of both contributions of the scattered spectra and produce an estimate of the average physisorption well depth of the interaction potential .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "the theory is fully developed together with a description of the iteration method in the following section  [ theory ] . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "a convenient way of describing a surface scattering event is through a differential reflection coefficient , written as @xmath0 which gives the fraction of an incident beam of momentum @xmath1 that is scattered into the small energy interval and small solid angle in the direction of the scattered momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the differential reflection coefficient obeys the unitarity condition which assures that the number of particles scattered equals the number incident on the surface @xmath3    the interaction potential is specified by a vibrating repulsive wall with a square physisorption well in front of depth @xmath4 and width @xmath5 , where the actual length of @xmath5 plays a role in calculating the trapping times but is unimportant for all other calculations as long as it is larger than the selvage region containing the vibrational corrugations of the repulsive potential .",
    "it is assumed that the exchange of energy and momentum with the surface occurs only in collisions with the repulsive wall , while all trapped particles collide with a stationary wall at the front of the well positioned at @xmath6 that simply reflects specularly .",
    "this means that for the purpose of calculating the resulting distribution after a collision the differential reflection coefficient is calculated using momenta that include the well depth in the normal component .",
    "for example , a particle that would have momentum @xmath7 outside the well has the momentum @xmath8 inside where the two differ in that the energy associated with perpendicular motion is increased by the well depth @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the atom mass .",
    "similarly , an atom incident from asymptotically far away with polar angle @xmath11 with respect to the surface normal will be refracted inside the well into the angle @xmath12 the relationship between the differential reflection coefficients inside and outside of the well for the fraction which escapes is given by a simple jacobian that is calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ refr1a ] ) and  ( [ refra ] ) .    within this model ,",
    "the trajectory of a given atom consists of successive collisions with the surface .",
    "the incoming beam first enters the well and then proceeds to have a first collision with the repulsive wall that scatters into a distribution of energies and angles dictated by the differential reflection coefficient .",
    "some of these scattered particles have sufficient energy and small enough polar angles to escape out of the well , this is the direct scattering portion .",
    "the remaining particles are trapped , they are specularly reflected by the front face of the potential well , and then they travel back to the repulsive potential where they suffer a second collision .",
    "this process repeats multiple times until all of the initially trapped atoms eventually escape the confines of the potential well .",
    "based on a zeroth order differential reflection coefficient @xmath13 which , for each collision with the repulsive potential , gives the probability of scattering from momentum state @xmath14 to @xmath15 the total differential reflection coefficient after @xmath16 such collisions can be written schematically as @xmath17 where the intermediate integrations in the higher order terms are carried out only over those energies and angles that pertain to particles trapped in the bound states .",
    "such a procedure lends itself to an iterative formulation in which the scattered distribution remaining in the well after the last collision becomes the source for the next collision . the angular and energy space within the well is divided into bins sufficiently small so as to obtain good numerical precision and it is necessary to keep track separately of the three different types of trajectories , i.e. , the trapped particles with negative total energy ( the trapping fraction ) , the trapped particles with positive energy ( the chattering fraction ) and those that escape at each iteration ( the trapping - desorption fraction ) .",
    "an explicit mathematical description of how this is accomplished is as follows .",

    "the critical angle for reflection of particles in the positive energy chattering fraction from the front of the well is @xmath24 which is dependent on energy and given by an equation similar to eq .",

    "@xmath59 a variety of methods can be used , but we have found that the most convenient is to first calculate the average speed normal to the surface for the trapped particles after each iteration .",
    "the time for that iteration is then determined as that required to travel the distance @xmath60 from the repulsive wall to the front of the well and back .    the average normal speed for the positive energy trapped fraction is @xmath61 and for the negative energy trapped fraction it is @xmath62 the total trapping time is then given by summing the times at each iteration @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the fraction of initially trapped particles .",

    "for shallow well depths the trapping times are very short and the average time spent in negative and positive energy trapped states is comparable . as the well depth is increased , trapping times increase dramatically and the average time spent in the positive energy chattering state becomes negligible compared to the average time in the negative energy bound states .",
    "this increase in trapping times is nearly exponential as a function of well depth as is seen in fig .",
    "[ desorptiontimed ] which graphs the numbers presented in tables  [ arwtime ] and  [ newtime ] .",
    "generally , the trapping times based on the rms speed after each iteration are somewhat smaller than those based on a calculation of the average speed .",

    "when the incident energy becomes comparable to or larger than the well depth the nature of the scattered intensity becomes quite different .",
    "as noticed in an important series of experiments first performed some years ago the intensity often exhibits a double - peaked structure , with a high energy peak due to direct scattering and a lower energy peak arising from the trapping - desorption fraction .",

    "the total integrated direct scattering becomes larger and the peak becomes broader , the width roughly increasing proportionately to @xmath96 . on the other hand the total trapping - desorption fraction becomes smaller and the shape of the distribution becomes less and less like that of an equilibrium knudsen curve . for large @xmath95",
    "the trapping desorption intensity develops a long high - energy tail although its peak position always remains near to the most probable energy of the knudsen distribution .",
    "the situation in which the differential reflection coefficient exhibits both distinct direct and a trapping - desorption peaks is discussed more in the next section in the context of comparisons of the present theoretical model with recent experimental data .",
    "the calculations exhibited in the above section describe the range of initial conditions that lead to an equilibrium distribution in the trapping - desorption fraction but no comparisons with experimental data other than to a knudsen distribution were made .",
    "however , in order to be credible , the theoretical approach should be capable of explaining real experiments .",
    "demonstrating that ability is the objective of this section .",
    "there is a long history of gas - surface scattering experiments using hyperthermal atoms  @xcite and molecules  @xcite as projectiles .",
    "if the projectile gas has mass larger than that of hydrogen or helium such high energies imply that the scattering will be classical , which means that many phonons will be transferred in the collision .",
    "this is the type of experiment that should be amenable to the theoretical treatment described here . in many cases",

    "the potential energy landscape function developed for the classical trajectory calculations had a well depth ranging from 33 mev at the on - top sites above the terminal ch@xmath101 groups to 67 mev in the center of the rhombus formed by a group of four of the methyl groups .",

    "this appears to indicate that for larger normal incident energy the incoming atoms are probing deeper parts of the potential energy landscape , which as mentioned above has been estimated to have a well with depths that vary between 33 and 67 mev .",
    "@xcite again , as in fig .",
    "[ ei365 ] the trapping - desorption fraction exhibits structure at larger final energies near the energy of the direct scattering .",
    "comparison of the present calculations to this ar scattering data leads to a few general comments that can be applied to the observed energy - resolved spectra for cases in which a double structure appears due to the distinct phenomena of direct scattering and trapping - desorption : + ( 1 ) a characteristic double - feature structure , with a well - defined direct scattering peak and a secondary peak or shoulder arising from trapping - desorption appears only at relatively high incident beam energy and when one or the other of @xmath11 or @xmath75 is large , as was already clear from ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "it is also necessary that the physisorption well depth is sufficiently large to cause significant trapping in the bound states during the initial collision , and the temperature must be smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "however , for near normal incidence conditions and with a large well , the initial trapping becomes so large that the direct scattering contribution becomes small , and this explains the need for the incident angle to be relatively large .",
    "this situation becomes evident in fig .",
    "[ thf10 ] which shows calculations for @xmath119 mev with @xmath120 and @xmath106 mev . even though the incident energy is large compared to the well depth , the normal incidence conditions gives rise to such large trapping that the total scattering is not very different from the trapping - desorption fraction .",
    "+ ( 2 ) when the direct scattering contribution is significant , the trapping - desorption intensity deviates substantially from that of an equilibrium knudsen distribution .",
    "in fact , the trapping - desorption signal can exhibit structure and small peak - like features at high energies close to those of the direct contribution as shown in figs .",
    "[ ei365 ] and  [ ei582 ] .",
    "however , in many cases the largest portion of the trapping - desorption intensity resembles the shape of a knudsen distribution and this is especially true for the low energy tail .",

    "( [ m4a ] ) shows that the fwhm of the direct scattering peak will be approximately proportional to @xmath126 , which is the characteristic of the multiphonon scattering regime .",

    "( [ knudsen ] ) .",
    "similarly , the most probable intensity ( maximum peak intensity ) of the direct scattering will vary as @xmath127 according to eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) while the trapping - desorption peak intensity should behave more like that of the @xmath128 behavior of the knudsen distribution of eq .",
    "( [ knudsen ] ) .",
    "+ ( 4 ) finally , the comparison of the present calculations with the data provide a simple way to extract the two relevant parameters .",
    "the position in final energy of the narrow direct scattering peak determines the value of the effective surface mass , and in fact , the most probable energy is quite sensitive to this parameter .",
    "the intensity of the broad trapping - desorption peak increases with the well depth , and fixing the relative intensities of the two contributions determines @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates that for the large incident energies considered here the primary influence of the well depth is to establish the initial trapping fraction .",
    "once trapped , the details of the shape of the potential well are not important as is evidenced by the fact that the long - time tail trapping - desorption fraction ( the low energy tail ) eventually desorbs at thermal energies .",
    "in this paper we have developed a theoretical formulation of the scattering of atomic projectiles with surfaces that includes not only the direct scattering arising from a single , or a small number of collisions with the surface but also allows for trapping and subsequent collisions of trapped particles inside the physisorption well .",
    "the trapped particles can be followed until they eventually all desorb and leave the surface region .",
    "the multiple collisions of the initially trapped fraction with the surface are treated with an iteration algorithm that tracks trapped particles with both negative and positive total energies and determines at each subsequent collision the fraction scattered back into the positive energy continuum which then leaves the surface region .    using this theoretical formalism",
    "we have calculated numerous examples , firstly in order to establish the conditions under which the trapped and subsequently desorbed particles approach an equilibrium distribution , i.e. , to establish the conditions under which the maxwell assumption is valid , and secondly we have used the theory to produce quantitative agreement with recent measurements thus providing explanations of the basic underlying processes that give rise to the experimental scattered spectra .    under many conditions ,",
    "the observed spectra in gas - surface scattering experiments consist of two distinct contributions .",
    "the first contribution is the direct scattering part which is usually a relatively sharp peak with a most probable energy somewhat lower than the incident energy provided that the surface temperature is not large compared to the incident energy .",
    "the second of these contributions is the trapping - desorption , attributed to particles that are initially trapped and then spend a large time moving in the physisorption well where they slowly begin to exchange energy with the surface and then eventually desorb in a distribution at thermal energies corresponding to the surface temperature . a large part of the work considered here is devoted to determining when the trapping - desorption fraction approaches an equilibrium knudsen flux .",
    "our calculations show that under conditions in which a clear direct scattering and trapping - desorption double - peaked structure is evident in the energy - resolved spectra the trapping - desorption fraction , although mainly emitted at thermal energies , can differ considerably from an equilibrium distribution .",
    "it can even exhibit structure consisting of small peaks at high energy near the most probable energy of the direct scattered intensity .",
    "these higher energy peaks arise from the first few collisions with the surface inside the well indicating that these initial collisions have a large probability of ejecting particles into the continuum with little additional energy loss as compared to the direct scattering .",
    "however , even under conditions for which the trapping - desorption fraction is highly non - equilibrium its low energy tail still is well described by a knudsen distribution .",
    "thus , our calculations show that the maxwell assumption is rarely achieved in real experimental conditions , although it is very useful as an approximate guide as is evident from the fact that it is still often used as a method to analyze measured data .",
    "we carried out a number of calculations in order to characterize the conditions under which the trapping - desorption fraction does approach an equilibrium distribution .",
    "basically , equilibrium behavior is achieved only for cases where the direct scattering is negligible and average trapping times are long , which implies that nearly all of the incident beam is adsorbed after the first collision .",
    "this implies an incident energy relatively small compared to the interaction potential physisorption well depth and temperatures corresponding to energies ( measured in units of @xmath129 ) that are also small compared to the well depth .",
    "the approach to equilibrium occurs more rapidly with larger gas - to - surface - atom mass ratios when this ratio is less than unity .",
    "the approach to equilibrium of the trapping - desorption fraction was studied as a function of of all the initial experimental parameters that can be manipulated , including the projectile and surface mass , the well depth of the potential , the incident energy and angles , the final scattering angles and the surface temperature .",
    "for example , as the well depth is increased with all other parameters held constant , we find that the energy - resolved scattered spectrum rather quickly approaches that of a knudsen distribution when the well depth becomes significantly larger than the incident energy provided the temperature is also small compared to the well depth .",
    "the angular behavior becomes independent of azimuthal angle under the same conditions that the energy distribution becomes knudsen - like .",
    "however , the polar angle @xmath76 behavior is only approximately obeyed for conditions under which the energy dependence first approaches equilibrium , even though the energy dependence is nearly knudsen - like at all polar angles . only for well depths",
    "very large compared to the incident energy and temperature does the trapping - desorption fraction achieve the classic knudsen @xmath130 shape .    in this formalism , because of its iterative approach , the number of collisions of the trapped particles with the surface can be followed .",
    "this means that trapping times can be calculated as well as other information such as the relative fractions of particles trapped with negative total energies and those trapped in the chattering states having positive total energies . under conditions",
    "in which the trapping - desorption fraction did achieve near equilibrium the trapping times were estimated to be as large as @xmath131 s. the positive total energy chattering fraction can be large under conditions where equilibrium is not achieved , but for conditions that produce equilibrium in the trapping - desorption the fraction of trapped particles residing in the chattering states becomes negligible .",
    "an important aspect of this work is that the theoretical model used for the calculations provides quantitative explanations of experimental measurements .",
    "we made comparisons with important and recent ar scattering data obtained in beams - surface scattering experiments with a surface consisting of a self - assembled adsorbed layer of 1-decanethiol on a well - ordered au(111 ) substrate .",
    "@xcite in agreement with the experimental observations , we found that clearly distinguishable direct and trapping - desorption contributions arise when the incident beam energy is large compared to the potential well depth and when one or the other of the incident or detector angles was large relative to the surface normal .",
    "in addition the calculations indicate that , in order to resolve distinct direct and trapping - desorption features , the temperature must be small compared to the well depth and the well depth must be large enough to cause trapping of a significant fraction of the incident beam at the initial collision .    under conditions for which distinct direct and trapping - desorption features were evident , the data can be used to determine two important characteristics of the interaction potential , the effective surface mass of the adsorbate and the well depth .",
    "the effective mass is determined by matching the calculated direct scattering peak to that of the experiment , and the well depth then is determined by matching the relative intensity of the trapping - desorption contribution .    an interesting prediction coming out of this work is that the direct and trapping - desorption contributions have clearly different signature behaviors as a function of surface temperature .",
    "the fwhm of the direct peak should increase approximately with the square root of the temperature whereas the trapping - desorption has a full width that increases approximately linearly with @xmath50 , similarly to the knudsen distribution .",
    "the most probable intensity of the direct peak , according to the scattering model used here , decreases inversely with the square root of temperature , while the trapping - desorption decreases roughly linearly with the inverse of the temperature , again similarly to the knudsen distribution . for both peaks ,",
    "the increase in fwhm and decrease of most probable intensity is the behavior expected in order to preserve unitarity .",
    "it should be noted that the direct scattering , as shown in the approximations to eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ m4a])-([m3 ] ) , exhibits the same behavior in the incident energy @xmath95 as it does in the temperature @xmath50 .",
    "however , the most appropriate parameter in which to carry out an experimental search for these behaviors would be the temperature , because the interaction potential surface is likely to change with variation of @xmath95 but is less likely to change with @xmath50 .",
    "this work demonstrates that calculations of direct scattering , trapping and desorption in atom - surface scattering can provide real quantitative explanations of experiments as well as indicating the conditions for the validity of maxwell s assumption on the equilibrium nature of the trapping - desorption fraction .",
    "it shows that the interaction potential model must contain two essential ingredients : a physisorption well depth and it must allow for transfer of mechanical energy between the projectile and the surface atoms .",
    "however , it also shows that the most important aspect is to have a theory in which the statistical mechanics is treated in a reasonably correct manner .",
