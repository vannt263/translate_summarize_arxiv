    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) provides an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) and in the presence of r - parity , naturally includes a good dark matter candidate .",
    "the mssm also leads to the presence of a higgs boson , with sm - like properties , which is naturally light , with a tree - level mass smaller than the @xmath2-gauge boson mass  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the current experimental bound on a sm - like higgs boson from the lep experiment , @xmath3  gev , demands relatively large radiative corrections induced by the third generation squarks  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "such large corrections may only be obtained by large squark masses which lead at the same time to large negative radiative corrections to the soft supersymmetry breaking higgs mass parameter .",
    "hence , proper electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) may only be obtained by fine - tuning the negative soft supersymmetry breaking and positive @xmath4 term contributions to the effective higgs mass parameter .",
    "the situation may be improved if the electroweak sm gauge group proceeds from a larger gauge structure which is spontaneously broken to the sm group at energies of a few tev .",
    "if the supersymmetry breaking parameter of the scalars , which are associated with the breakdown of the extended gauge symmetry , is much larger than the order parameter of the gauge symmetry breakdown , the d - term of the low energy weak interactions may be enhanced .",
    "this , in turn , leads to larger values of the tree - level sm - like higgs boson mass and reduces fine tuning  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    a natural implementation of these ideas",
    "may be realized by extending the weak gauge group to the group @xmath5 , where the two higgs doublets of the mssm as well as the third generation particles are charged under one of the two @xmath0 groups , @xmath6 , while the first and second generation particles are charged under @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 symmetry is eventually broken to the diagonal @xmath9 group that may be identified with the one associated with the sm weak interactions .",
    "such an extension of the mssm is anomaly free and can lead to an understanding of the hierarchy of the third generation and the lighter generation masses .",
    "for relatively large values of the @xmath6 gauge coupling one can get sm - like higgs boson masses up to 300  gev .",
    "such large higgs boson masses tend to be in conflict with precision electroweak observables  @xcite .",
    "the model described above , provides extra contributions to these observables .",
    "on one side , there are non - universal contributions to the third generation quark and lepton couplings to the weak gauge bosons , which are induced by the mixing of the heavy gauge bosons with the sm ones .",
    "such contributions may be minimized for large values of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalars that provide the breakdown of the extended symmetry ( see , for example , ref .",
    "however , the presence of a heavy higgs still leads to a relatively large negative contribution to the @xmath1-parameter , leading to further tension with the precision electroweak observables .    in this work",
    "we emphasize that the same d - term contributions that lead to an enhancement of the higgs mass also lead to a splitting of the left - handed super - partners of the third generation squarks and sleptons as well as the non - standard higgs bosons .",
    "we show that the mass splitting of these doublets is naturally of the size necessary to compensate the large negative higgs contribution , restoring agreement of the model with precision electroweak data , similar to the inert higgs doublet models  @xcite .",
    "the modification of the spectrum leads to novel phenomenological properties with respect to the mssm .",
    "it is the aim of this article to discuss these properties as well as the associated supersymmetry breaking mechanism that may be consistent with such a spectrum .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we review the model . in section  3",
    "we describe the higgs and sparticle spectrum and discuss the contributions to the @xmath1-parameter . in section  4",
    "we describe a possible realization of supersymmetry breaking that leads to a spectrum of third generation left - handed sparticles much lighter than the first and second generation ones and discuss the collider physics associated with this model . in section  5",
    "we comment on the possible cosmological constraints . in section  6",
    "we describe a different possibility , in which the non - standard higgs bosons become light , while the left - handed squarks and sleptons remain heavy .",
    "we reserve section  7 for our conclusions .",
    "a simple way to implement the possibility of an enhanced electroweak d - term is through the enlarged weak gauge group @xmath8 .",
    "the two mssm higgs bosons and the third generation left - handed doublet super - fields are charged under @xmath6 but singlets under @xmath7 , while the lighter generations left - handed doublets are singlets under @xmath6 but charged under @xmath7 .",
    "a bidoublet , @xmath10 , is introduced which acquires a vev , @xmath11 , breaking the product group to the diagonal one , @xmath9 , which is identified with the sm weak group . the effective weak gauge coupling is therefore given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the @xmath6 and @xmath7 gauge couplings , respectively .",
    "for values of @xmath15 the weak coupling is approximately equal to @xmath14 .",

    "an important aspect of this model that was omitted from ref .",
    "@xcite is that the presence of the d - terms will also induce additional splitting in the higgs , squark and slepton masses . in order to understand this point",

    "( [ vd ] ) leads to a positive contribution , @xmath40 to the mass of the third generation squarks and sleptons , where @xmath41 ,  and @xmath42 are the @xmath43 vevs .",
    "the second term in @xmath44 is the sum of the squares of the @xmath0 invariant combinations that couple to the corresponding quark and lepton @xmath0 singlets in the superpotential yukawa terms .",
    "therefore , it leads to negative contributions , @xmath45 , to the squark and slepton doublet component that couples via the yukawa interaction with the higgs @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .",
    "the sparticles also receives @xmath48-term contributions associated with the superpotential @xmath49 in particular , the third generation squarks receive supersymmetric contributions proportional to their super - partner masses , which become particularly important in the case of the top squarks .",
    "the combination of the f - term and d - term contributions lead to the following splitting between the third generation left - handed squark and slepton mass parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52  gev is the sm higgs boson vev and @xmath53 is the enhanced d - term contribution to the tree - level higgs mass and we have ignored all sm quark and lepton masses apart from the top quark mass . for moderate to large values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , which we will assume from now on , @xmath56 .",
    "the case of the non - standard higgs bosons should be treated separately . the charged higgs and cp - odd states",
    "are defined as orthogonal to the corresponding charged and neutral goldstone boson states , namely @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the charged higgs and cp - odd components of the higgs field doublets @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , and for @xmath60 we redefine @xmath61 which carries the same hypercharge as @xmath62 .",
    "similar to the mssm case , the neutral cp - odd mass is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65      the additional splitting described in the previous section between the masses of the higgs bosons , sleptons and squarks can have important phenomenological implications .",
    "for instance , contrary to naive expectations , for large values of the d - term contribution to the higgs mass , the left - handed sbottom becomes heavier than the left - handed stops .",
    "the exact stop and sbottom spectrum depends , however , on the mixing with the right - handed third generation squarks . in this section , to simplify the discussion , we will assume those mixings to be small , something that is natural for non - degenerate squarks , moderate values of @xmath66 and non - extreme values of @xmath54 .",

    "if the ratio of the heavier doublet mass eigenstate to the lighter one is smaller than about 3 , the contribution to the @xmath1 parameter may be approximated by  @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of colors , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the differences between the masses and the squared masses of the heavier and lighter components of the doublet .",

    "the triplet vev leads therefore to a contribution to the @xmath1 parameter @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the triplet mass . for values of @xmath34 and the triplet mass necessary to significantly enhance the tree - level higgs mass , these contributions prove to be too small to compensate for the negative higgs mass contributions to the @xmath1-parameter for @xmath93 gev",

    "( [ deltat150300 ] ) and fig .",

    ", the most important sm - like higgs boson search channels will be its decays into charged and neutral gauge bosons , namely @xmath102    these searches will become very efficient in the first years of the lhc run  @xcite , and therefore we expect these kind of models to be probed with the first few fb  @xmath103 of lhc running . moreover , if the higgs mass is below 190  gev , then even the tevatron will be able to probe these models in the coming years  @xcite .",

    "moreover , the coupling of third generation sneutrinos to the higgs boson is enhanced with respect to the one in the mssm , due to the enhanced @xmath0 d - term contribution and is given by @xmath105 due to this enhanced coupling , the higgs boson may have a significant decay branching ratio into light sneutrinos , therefore avoiding the tevatron bounds .",

    "somewhat smaller or larger values of the sneutrino masses , within the range consistent with precision measurements and smaller than a half of the higgs mass , lead to more or less restrictive tevatron bounds on this model , respectively .      in this section",

    "we shall assume that yukawa couplings for the first and second generation quarks and leptons are generated by adding a massive higgs - like pair of doublets which transform under @xmath122 , as was suggested in  @xcite , and work with this minimal spectrum . with this minimal spectrum ,",
    "the @xmath123 function coefficients are given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 correspond to the @xmath7 and @xmath6 gauge groups , while @xmath127 and @xmath128 correspond to the hypercharge and strong interactions , respectively .",
    "the above values should be compared to the mssm case : @xmath129 this will generally upset unification of couplings  @xcite .",
    "let us stress , however , that for the chosen low energy values of these couplings , the @xmath7 coupling @xmath130 becomes close to @xmath131 and @xmath132 at scales of about the standard grand unification scale , @xmath133 gev .",
    "the modified @xmath134 function coefficients also have consequences for the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",

    "if we assume a common gaugino mass , they will be pushed to large values driven by the strong @xmath6 gaugino effects .",
    "therefore , for the third generation sleptons to remain light , we need a mechanism of susy breaking that keeps the third generation soft scalar masses small at low energies while the strong @xmath136 coupling @xmath13 runs to large values",

    "this is in contrast to what happens in the mssm  @xcite , where the non - universal requirement @xmath155 is necessary to obtain smaller left - handed masses for the third generation sleptons . in the case of soft gaugino masses ,",
    "their one - loop rge take the form , @xmath156 where , as stressed above , up to the @xmath157 breaking scale @xmath158 for the @xmath140 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath139 gauge groups , and after the breakdown of @xmath149 , we get the standard mssm result , @xmath159 .    the solution of the rg equations show that the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters @xmath160 and @xmath161 are approximately given by @xmath162 while the low energy bino and wino masses are given by @xmath163 the requirement of getting the appropriate stau and tau - sneutrino masses for a given value of the higgs mass and @xmath54 defines the allowed parameter space in the @xmath164@xmath135 plane .",

    "this should be compared with , for instance , the standard low scale gaugino mediated scenario , in which the right - handed staus are naturally the nlsp  @xcite .    due to our mechanism of susy breaking and the new big d - term contributions to third generation sleptons , there is a lower bound on the soft scalar universal mass coming from the requirement of the sneutrino to be in the right mass range to lead to agreement with precision electroweak observables .",

    "[ m0m1/2 ] , where for example , for a higgs mass @xmath173  gev , @xmath174 gev for @xmath175 gev to fulfill this requirement .",
    "in the case of a universal gaugino mass , @xmath135 , at high energy , we naturally obtain that the lightest neutralino , @xmath176 , is mostly bino - like , while the second lightest neutralino , @xmath177 , is mostly wino - like .",
    "this implies that right - handed squarks mostly decay to @xmath178 . from fig .",
    "[ m0m1/2 ] , depending on the initial masses , @xmath141 and @xmath135 , we see that we can have either @xmath179 or @xmath180 for a small scalar mass @xmath141 and a moderate gaugino mass @xmath135 , once we take into account the d - term corrections .",
    "we also expect the left - handed first and second family squarks and sleptons to be heavier than the lightest neutralino since their masses run with @xmath139 and @xmath122 couplings respectively . with these considerations in mind , for a light sneutrino nlsp , we infer the following possible mass spectra : @xmath181 which are realized in tables  [ colltable1 ] , [ colltable2 ] and [ colltable3 ] .    in order to calculate the particle spectrum at low energies for some sample points at high energies and to calculate the main decays we used sdecay  @xcite .",
    "sdecay works mainly within the mssm and thus we had to slightly modify the rge used in the program to make it suitable for our model . from the rg",
    "running we expect modifications to the spectrum at high energies .",
    "furthermore sdecay only calculates two body decays of sparticles . to understand the behavior at low energies ,",
    "let us write the tree level stau mass matrix , taking into account the non - zero trilinear terms and the left - right mixing , @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath161 are the third generation left- and right - handed slepton soft breaking masses respectively , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "we can see that the mass eigenstates will have an admixture of left- and right - handed components , mainly due to the mixing caused by the @xmath4 term in eq.([staumatrix ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath186 , due to the smallness of the @xmath152 mass , we expect this admixture to be small .",
    "similarly , the tau sneutrino modified mass is given by , @xmath187 where @xmath188 .",
    "furthermore , minimizing the tree level higgs potential we find the following expression for @xmath4 , @xmath189 where @xmath190 , and likewise the tree - level higgs masses are given by , @xmath191 observe that for @xmath192 , the above expressions reduce to the well known mssm ones .      the particle spectrum and",
    "the most important branching ratios for some sample points are presented in tables  [ colltable1 ] ,  [ colltable2 ] and  [ colltable3 ] .",
    "table  [ colltable1 ] presents a case of sneutrinos which are light enough to allow the decay of a higgs into two on - shell tau - sneutrinos .",
    "similar to the example discussed in the previous section , the higgs decay branching ratio into a pair of @xmath114 s is reduced to a value that is less than half of the sm result , therefore avoiding the current tevatron bounds .    as can be seen from table  [ colltable2 ] and  [ colltable3 ] , two body decays , @xmath193 ,",
    "tend to be kinematically allowed and thus may be an important decay modes for the light staus .",
    "therefore , we expect relatively hard leptons and@xmath194or jets plus missing energy to be the an important signature from @xmath115 decays .",
    "this is very different from regular gaugino mediated susy breaking scenarios in the mssm where the lightest stau tends to decay into @xmath152 s and gravitinos , and the heaviest stau , since the mass difference , @xmath195 is small , tends to decay into an on - shell @xmath152 and a bino .",
    "indeed , the small sneutrino - stau mass difference allows only 3-body decays , which through an off - shell @xmath196 , leads to soft fermions : @xmath197 plus missing energy  @xcite .",
    ".spectrum and branching ratios for @xmath175 gev , @xmath121 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 gev , @xmath200 and @xmath201 gev .",
    "since the first and second generations are almost degenerate , we only give results for the first and third sfermion generations . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this article we have analyzed the phenomenological and cosmological properties of the mssm with enhanced @xmath0 d - terms . due to the splitting introduced in the third generation sfermion and non - standard higgs boson masses",
    ", we were able to raise the higgs mass up to about 300 gev without being in conflict with precision electroweak tests .",
    "we worked out a particular supersymmetry breaking scenario that leads to the presence of light third generation sleptons , which provide the necessary positive contribution to the @xmath1 parameter to compensate for the negative one induced by the heavy higgs boson . assuming universal soft supersymmetry breaking gaugino , sfermion and higgs masses at the messenger scale , this supersymmetry breaking scenario leads to the presence of heavy squarks and non - standard higgs bosons .",
    "the slepton spectrum is therefore determined from the requirement of reestablishing agreement with precision electroweak data .",
    "we studied the corresponding collider signatures , which , similar to what happens in the light stau scenario in the mssm , is characterized by the presence of many tau s and copious missing energy in the final states . for larger values of the higgs mass ,",
    "the mass difference between the charged stau and the sneutrino is large enough to allow two body decays of the staus into @xmath114 and @xmath202 s .",
    "such final states would be a signature of the enhanced @xmath0 d - term scenarios .",
    "furthermore , higgs searches into pairs of @xmath196 and @xmath2 gauge bosons would be similar to the sm except in a small region of parameter space where tau sneutrinos are light enough to allow higgs decays into sneutrino pairs .",
    "this additional decay mode may lead to a large enough modification of the branching ratios of higgs decay into gauge bosons to avoid recent tevatron bounds on the higgs mass .    for",
    "the range of slepton masses consistent with precision electroweak data , the sneutrinos can not provide a consistent thermal relic density .",
    "indeed , mainly due to the @xmath2-mediated annihilation channel , the thermal sneutrino dark matter density turns out to be too small .",
    "therefore , we have assumed a gravitino lsp , heavy enough to avoid thermal equilibrium with the plasma .",
    "gravitinos are produced by the decay of the light sneutrinos and by the scattering of particles in the early universe .",
    "for appropriate values of the reheating temperature the proper dark matter relic density may be obtained .    in the presence of a gravitino lsp",
    ", the light sneutrino decays in the early universe can lead to modifications of the light element abundances .",
    "however , for sneutrino masses leading to agreement with precision electroweak data and gravitino masses larger than a few gev , these constraints prove to be too weak to lead to any relevant bound on the models discussed in this work .    finally , we have discussed possible alternative scenarios in which the @xmath6 gauginos are not suppressed and therefore the third generation left - handed sleptons masses are driven to large values by their re - normalization group effects .",
    "the non - standard higgs bosons will remain light for sufficiently large values of @xmath54 and may play a relevant role in canceling the negative contributions to the @xmath1 parameter induced by the heavy higgs .",
    "this scenario is constrained by current tevatron searches on standard and non - standard higgs bosons and by cosmological constraints .",
    "moreover , as is well known , the neutral and charged higgs components may induce relevant flavor violating effects in such scenarios .",
    "however , the large mass splitting between the neutral and charged components induced by the @xmath6 d - terms leads to important differences in the flavor constraints with respect to the traditional mssm .",
    "in particular , the heaviness of the charged higgs dilutes the strong constraints on the mssm proceeding from the rare decays @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
