    "relaxor ferroelectrics have great potential for applications due to their piezoelectric and dielectric properties @xcite , but there is much that is not understood about how their properties arise on a microscopic level @xcite .",
    "the composition of many relaxors is related to simple perovskites with the abo@xmath2 formula , but with one cation site randomly filled with two or more cations of different valences , resulting in strong , disordered electric fields . for the relaxor pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pmn )",
    ", the b@xmath6 site is occupied by mg@xmath7 and nb@xmath8 .",
    "the variation in valence can be reduced by doping with an ion of intermediate valence , e.g. , ti@xmath6 in the case of pmn doped with @xmath9% pbtio@xmath2 ( pmn - x%pt ) .",
    "the resulting pmn-@xmath9%pt phase diagram shows four basic regions @xcite : a cubic paraelectric phase at high temperature for all @xmath9 ; a region with relaxor behavior for low @xmath9 with either cubic or rhombohedral symmetry ; a tetragonal , conventional ferroelectric region for high @xmath9 ; and a morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) region between the relaxor and tetragonal regions .",
    "the piezoelectric coefficients @xmath10 are very large in the mpb region and abruptly drop for higher @xmath9 @xcite ; understanding this behavior and exploiting the large piezoelectricity provide much of the motivation for exploring relaxor ferroelectrics .",
    "these pmn-@xmath9%pt solid solutions with small @xmath9 exhibit clear relaxor behavior characterized by large dielectric constants which have a broad maximum with respect to temperature and are highly frequency - dispersive within this range . these relaxor behaviors are widely believed to be associated with polar nano - regions ( pnr ) or other short - range polar order , as shown by numerous x - ray and neutron diffuse scattering studies @xcite .    we have previously characterized two distinct components of the diffuse scattering in pmn-@xmath9%pt , which we label t1 and t2 @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "these labels are intended to refer to the related phonons where a t1 mode is a transversely polarized phonon propagating along @xmath11 and a t2 mode is a transversely polarized phonon propagating along @xmath12 .",
    "for example , near ( 100 ) , a ta@xmath13 phonon mode would refer to the transverse acoustic phonon mode propagating along the [ 010 ] or [ 001 ] directions with polarization along [ 100 ] , while near ( 110 ) , a ta@xmath14 phonon mode would refer to the transverse acoustic phonon mode propagating along [ 1@xmath150 ] with [ 110 ] polarization .",
    "the two diffuse scattering components can be distinguished by their anisotropic response when field - cooled ( fc ) , i.e. after applying electric field above the ferroelectric transition temperature t@xmath16 and then cooling below t@xmath16 . with a field applied along [ 111 ] , a redistribution of t2-diffuse scattering intensity between two differently - oriented components polarized along [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath150 ] has been observed in the structurally similar perovskite pbzn@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 doped with @xmath9% pbtio@xmath2 ( pzn-@xmath9%pt ) @xcite and in pmn @xcite .",
    "this situation has been interpreted in terms of a domain effect , in which applying a [ 111 ] field creates a single [ 111]-polarized ferroelectric domain ( as opposed to the eight possible @xmath17111@xmath18-polarized domains present in the zero - field cooled state ) which favors certain orientations of polar nanoregions ( pnr ) , resulting in the redistribution of diffuse scattering intensities along certain @xmath17110@xmath18 directions @xcite . an electric field along [ 001 ] , on the other hand , does not seem to significantly affect the t2-diffuse scattering in the @xmath19 plane @xcite .",
    "transverse acoustic phonons propagating along @xmath12 ( ta@xmath20-phonons ) are expected to couple with t2-diffuse scattering modes @xcite .",
    "evidence for this diffuse - ta@xmath20 phonon coupling has been shown with the help of an external [ 111 ] electric field , which breaks the pseudo - cubic symmetry and reveals a clear difference between ta@xmath20 phonons measured near ( 220 ) and ( 2@xmath210 )  @xcite .",
    "t1-diffuse scattering , on the other hand , does not show a redistribution of scattering intensity under an external field .",
    "instead , a suppression of [ 001]-polarized t1-diffuse scattering occurs under [ 001]-field cooling , while the [ 100]-polarized t1-diffuse scattering remains unaffected , as has been shown in pzn-@xmath9%pt @xcite .",
    "coupling between the t1-diffuse modes and the ta@xmath22 phonon modes has not yet been thoroughly studied .",
    "in this paper we report neutron scattering experiments on pmn-32%pt with a field applied along [ 001 ] . when cooled below @xmath23 k  @xcite , in addition to the expected suppression of t1-diffuse scattering measured near ( 001 )",
    ", we also see a clear change in the intensities of the ta@xmath22 phonons near ( 001 ) , whereas the ta@xmath13 phonons near ( 100 ) are unaffected .",

    "the diffuse - phonon coupling along the @xmath68 ( t1 ) and @xmath12 ( t2 ) directions share some common features .",
    "for example , when the diffuse scattering is suppressed by the external field , we always see a hardening of the corresponding ta phonon mode .",
    "evidentally , interaction between the pnr and the phonons tends to drive the phonons softer , for both the t1 and t2 modes .",
    "this tendency suggests that short - range polar orders are likely related to lattice instabilities in these relaxor compounds .    on the other hand ,",
    "the t1 and t2 modes differ in many aspects too :    \\(i ) for the case of the t2 modes , the field effect on the pnr ( and thus on the t2-diffuse scattering ) is indirect .",
    "an external field along [ 111 ] helps establish a single domain ferroelectric phase with [ 111 ] polarization .",
    "the change in the population of each domain induces a redistribution of pnr with different polarizations , resulting in the redistribution of t2-diffuse scattering intensities in reciprocal space .",
    "for example , under a [ 111 ] field there is an enhancement of the t2-diffuse scattering near the ( 220 ) bragg peak , but a reduction of the t2-diffuse scattering near the ( @xmath2120 ) bragg peak .",
    "the ta@xmath14 phonon near ( 220 ) softens , while the phonon near ( @xmath2120 ) hardens . on the other hand , in zero field",
    ", all @xmath70 domains are present to an equal degree .",
    "measurements in zero field of the ta@xmath14 phonons near ( 220 ) or ( @xmath71 ) average over both hardened and softened phonons , and the role of the [ 111 ] field is merely to obtain results for a single domain .",
    "however , the [ 001 ] field effects on the t1-diffuse scattering and t1-phonons are not domain related .",
    "this can be demonstrated by comparing the zfc and fc results . under fc conditions",
    ", one only sees changes ( relative to the zfc results ) for @xmath53 @xmath54 [ 001 ] , but no change for @xmath53 @xmath54 [ 100 ] .",
    "if these changes were due to domain effects , one would have expected the zfc results to lie in between ( in intensity , energy , etc . )",
    "the fc results measured for @xmath53 @xmath54 [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "therefore , the effect of the [ 001 ] field is more intrinsic , with the field directly affecting the short - range order and consequently the related phonon modes .",
    "\\(ii ) while there is no evidence of diffuse - to coupling for the t2 modes @xcite , in our sample there appears to be a weak diffuse - to coupling for @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath68 ( to@xmath13 modes ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the diffuse - phonon coupling for the t2 modes is strong throughout the entire brillouin zone , but the coupling for the t1 modes is only present for a small range of @xmath43 values ( @xmath720.1 to 0.2 r.l.u . )  away from @xmath53 .",
    "this anisotropy of the diffuse - ta coupling revealed by our electric field measurements is also consistent with previous reports  @xcite .    in order to understand these results , we consider the origin of the diffuse scattering and short - range orders in relaxors . the local random electric field generated by the b - site cations",
    "are believed to play important roles in pb - based relaxor systems  @xcite . a direct link between the diffuse scattering in these relaxors and the random field has been demonstrated by comparing two isostructures with and without random b - site valences  @xcite .",
    "the random field in the system prevents long - range order from developing and induces short - range orders that also grow with cooling .",
    "the diffuse scattering intensities from these short - range orders are not entirely static , and have a strong dynamic component  @xcite .",
    "the existence of these dynamic / quasi - elastic components has been explained by theoretical work  @xcite , and is essential for the coupling between the diffuse scattering and phonons .",
    "indeed one can see that in our work , the coupling between the t1-diffuse scattering and the ta@xmath22 phonon is weaker at 200  k than 400  k , where the dynamic component has also been shown to decrease with cooling  @xcite below t@xmath73 . the weak coupling to the to@xmath22 mode , can be understood based on knowing that the short - range orders consist of a combination of acoustic ( strain ) and optic ( polar ) types of atomic shifts  @xcite .",
    "the polar component of the short - range order can couple to the to mode .",
    "the coupling will likely diminish quickly when the to phonon energy increases and moves further away from the quasi - elastic component of the diffuse scattering , as is the case in our measurements .",
    "the anisotropy of the diffuse - phonon coupling between the t1 and t2 directions is more intriguing .",
    "the t2-diffuse is significantly stronger than the t1-diffuse , extends to a larger @xmath43-range in reciprocal space , and interacts with ta phonons along almost the entire branch .",
    "overall , we could consider a picture where pnrs are actually the `` core '' of the short - range correlations in the system , and contribute to the broader t2-diffuse ; while the polar / strain field surrounding the core can extend to much larger range and contribute to the narrower t1-diffuse .",
    "the atomic shifts in the pnrs would be significantly larger than those in the surrounding region , leading to a much stronger t2-diffuse scattering than the weaker t1-diffuse .",
    "the core of the short - range order , i.e. the pnrs , results from the local strong random field and can not be directly suppressed by an external field  @xcite .",
    "however , the weaker polar / strain field around the core is less robust and can be partially modified by external field , showing the intrinsic field effect on the t1-diffuse and its coupling to ta@xmath22 and to@xmath22 phonon modes discussed in this paper .",
    "an analog to this situation has recently been considered  @xcite where strong but dilute random fields are inserted into a system with a weak continous random field .",
    "theoretical work involving a magnetic system with a random field @xcite suggested that a large correlation length or even a weak long - range order could be achieved .",
    "if we map the pnrs to the strong random field in the magnetic system , the large spin correlation length proposed by the theoretical work can be related to the weak polar / strain field surrounding the pnrs which gives the t1-diffuse . although not an exact analog , this picture does provide a crude description of the origin of the two types of diffuse scattering .",
    "for a better understanding of the source of these diffuse scattering components and their coupling to lattice dynamics , more detailed experimental work is required . though numerous models have been proposed by various groups trying to describe the diffuse scattering and short - range orders in these relaxor systems  @xcite",

    "in fact , a similar value of @xmath82 can be obtained from phonon data on pzn-4.5%pt  @xcite .",
    "the diffuse - phonon coupling discussed in this paper can also affect how one determines the elastic constants .",
    "we calculated the phonon velocities from our fc data rather than our zfc data since we believe the fc velocities more closely resemble the velocities expected for @xmath83 .",
    "first , the diffuse - phonon coupling is expected to diminish as @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "second , since the diffuse - phonon coupling tends to reduce the phonon energy ( as discussed in this paper and refs .",
    "@xcite ) , at non - zero @xmath43 the elastic constants should be calculated from data taken after this coupling effect is removed , such as after diffuse scattering is suppressed by field . for zfc conditions ,",
    "the value for @xmath75 can be about 15% smaller than in fc conditions .",
    "this difference is in fact an artifact of calculating the phonon velocity using ( reduced ) phonon energies at non - zero @xmath43 ( we used data taken at @xmath45 and @xmath84 r.l.u .  for the calculation in the t1 and t2 directions , respectively ) .",
    "if one could obtain the phonon velocity using smaller @xmath43 values near @xmath85 where the diffuse - phonon coupling diminishes , the difference between zfc and fc data should become negligible .",
    "we have observed , when comparing field - cooling and zero - field - cooling conditions for different brillouin zones with a field along [ 001 ] , a change in the lattice dynamics of pmn-32%pt that correlates with changes in diffuse scattering .",
    "specifically , under field cooling we see a reduction of intensity and an increase of phonon energy for the ta@xmath13 mode measured near ( 001 ) and propagating along [ 100 ] ( @xmath68-polarized ) , but no change for ta@xmath13 phonons near ( 100 ) and propagating along [ 001 ] ( @xmath11-polarized ) .",
    "this field effect is only clearly seen for wavevectors around 0.1 to 0.2 r.l.u .",
    "away from the bragg peak .",
    "meanwhile , the t1-diffuse scattering near ( 001 ) is suppressed under field - cooling , but is unaffected near ( 100 ) .",
    "a similar effect is seen for the to@xmath13 mode , which is slightly suppressed near ( 002 ) from 4 to 9 mev , but unaffected near ( 200 ) .",
    "no clear field effect has been seen for the longitudinal modes near ( 001 ) or ( 100 ) , or for the ta@xmath14 mode near ( 101 ) .",
    "the similarities in the effect of field on the t1-diffuse scattering near ( 001 ) and ( 100 ) , the ta@xmath13 phonons near ( 001 ) and ( 100 ) , and the to@xmath13 phonons near ( 002 ) and ( 200 ) suggest the presence of diffuse - ta and diffuse - to mode coupling which resembles the mode coupling observed in the t2 directions in related relaxor materials .",
