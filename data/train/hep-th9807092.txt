    "recently baez @xcite , motivated by results @xcite of the canonical ( loop ) approach to quantum gravity , introduced a notion of `` spin foam models '' .",
    "the spin foam model of a theory , as we explain in details below , gives a way to calculate transition amplitudes for this theory .",
    "a transition amplitude arises as a sum over branched colored surfaces , or , using the name proposed by baez , spin foams .",
    "the results of reisenberger and rovelli @xcite , reisenberger @xcite , barrett and crane @xcite indicate that quantum gravity might be constructed as a spin foam model .",
    "however , spin foam models arise not only in the context of canonical ( loop ) quantum gravity .",
    "indeed , many of the known tqft s  for example , the migdal - witten model in two dimensions @xcite , the ponzano - regge @xcite and turaev - viro @xcite models in three spacetime dimensions , the ooguri model @xcite and its generalizations by crane , kauffmann and yetter @xcite  are state sum models and , by considering instead of sums over colored triangulations sums over the corresponding colored dual complexes , can be formulated as spin foam models .",
    "the state sum models mentioned are believed to correspond to certain well - known topological field theories . however",
    ", a precise relation between the classical theory and the corresponding state sum model is not known for some of these models .",
    "moreover , even for the models whose relation to the corresponding classical theory is established , this relation is rather indirect .",
    "thus , summarizing , one can say that there exists a large class of spin foam models that are claimed to correspond to such classical theories as yang - mills , bf theories and gravity in various dimensions , but no precise relation to this effect is known in many cases .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of this relation .",
    "more precisely , we study the relation between a spin foam formulation of a theory and the corresponding classical action principle . we propose and study a particular procedure that allows one to get a spin foam formulation for a large class of theories starting from the corresponding action principle .",
    "our approach is not limited to any particular spacetime dimension . however , having in mind applications to the models mentioned above , we restrict ourselves to two , three and four spacetime dimensions .",
    "when considering gravity , for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to metrics of euclidean signature .    our approach is inspired first of all by the results of the canonical ( loop ) approach @xcite to quantum gravity . of great importance for us",
    "were also the ideas of regge @xcite , the work of baez @xcite on degenerate solutions of general relativity and some results of barrett @xcite .",
    "motivated by all these results we propose to `` approximate '' some of the continuous fields appearing in the lagrangian of the theory by distributional fields concentrated along lower dimensional hypersurfaces in spacetime . to make contact with the known lattice models , we put our distributional fields on a triangulated manifold , so that they are concentrated along polygons of the dual complex . however , the idea is also valid in a context more general than a lattice model .",
    "the action of the theory calculated on such distributional fields becomes a sum of certain integrals over the hypersurfaces of lower dimension .",
    "then , to calculate a transition amplitude for the theory , one constructs the path integral of the exponentiated action over such distributional fields .",
    "as we shall see , this path integral becomes quite tractable .",
    "to make this idea little more precise , let us specify the class of theories that can be treated within our approach .",
    "we consider theories whose action is bf - like , that is , whose action is of the form @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the lie algebra valued two - form field ( for instance , @xmath5 field of bf theory ) , @xmath6 is the curvature of the connection form and @xmath7 is certain ( polynomial ) function of the @xmath4 field , which can also depend on some lagrange multipliers , as in the case of gravity in four dimensions , or on an additional background structure , as , for example , a fixed measure on @xmath8 in the case of yang - mills theory in two dimensions . below we will give many examples of theories belonging to this class .",
    "thus , the action is that of the bf theory with an additional term .",
    "we call the b field e because of its relation with the non - abelian `` electric '' field of the canonical formulation .    in order to compute a transition amplitude for a theory belonging to this class ,",
    "we take the path integral over classical configurations where the @xmath4 field , which is a zero- , one- or two - form in different dimensions , is a distributional field that vanishes everywhere except on two dimensional polygons in spacetime .",
    "note that in our approach only these distributional configurations of the e field are taken into account in the path integral .",
    "no usual smooth configurations of the e field are summed over .",
    "this can be viewed as a discretization procedure where we `` approximate '' the smooth @xmath4 field by `` squeezing '' it into a distributional field on a collection of two - dimensional polygons .",
    "one can expect that this approximation becomes good as the two - dimensional polygons become sufficiently packed in spacetime .",
    "however , this procedure can also be justified at a deeper level , as we shall argue .",
    "first , a justification for considering distributional fields in the path integral comes from the canonical quantum theory .",
    "the phase space of all theories we work with , as it can be seen from the above action functional , is that of yang - mills theory .",
    "the space of quantum states of the canonical theory is then given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the space of connections on the spatial manifold modulo gauge transformations , and @xmath11 is defined by an appropriate choice of measure on this space . in the case",
    "the spatial manifold is one - dimensional , there exists quite a natural choice of this measure : the functionals on @xmath10 are just class functions , and it is natural to use the haar measure on the group to define the inner product of such functionals . in higher dimensional cases , an analogous construction of @xmath9 was developed @xcite within the approach of canonical ( loop ) quantum gravity . in this construction ,",
    "integrable functions arise by considering the so - called cylindrical functionals , that is , functionals that depend on connection only through holonomies along some paths in space . in other words , one constructs the space of states of the theory by considering spaces of states of lattice gauge theories on graphs in space , and then taking the projective limit over graph refinements ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "a characteristic feature of the quantum theory constructed with such a space of states is the distributional nature of the electric field operator .",
    "let us illustrate this on the case of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional theory .",
    "a typical state from @xmath9 depends on the connection only through holonomies along some paths in space .",
    "although this is not important for our heuristic consideration here , let us note that gauge invariance implies that the paths form a closed graph in space .",
    "let us denote the edges of such a graph by @xmath12 .",
    "then a typical state supported on this graph is of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the holonomy of @xmath15 along the edge @xmath12 , and @xmath16 is a function with sufficiently good behavior .",
    "the electric field @xmath4 , which classically is a canonically conjugate quantity to @xmath15 , quantum mechanically becomes the operator @xmath17 of variational derivative with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "this operator , when acting on a typical state , gives zero for all points @xmath18 except the points lying on the edges @xmath12 , where the result is distributional .",
    "thus , in a typical quantum state , the electric field @xmath4 is distributional with support on edges @xmath12 of the corresponding graph .",
    "one normally views a state of the canonical theory as a state `` at a given time '' .",
    "thus , electric field `` at each given time '' is distributional and concentrated along edges of the graph .",
    "this suggests that one should think of the `` history '' of the electric field configuration as of a collection of _ two - dimensional _ surfaces in spacetime , along which the electric field is distributional .",
    "when sliced by a spatial hypersurface `` at given time '' , such a collection of surfaces gives a graph in space , and electric field is distributional along the edges of this graph .",
    "these heuristic considerations suggest that one should consider configurations of @xmath4 field that are distributional and concentrated along two dimensional surfaces in spacetime .",
    "as we will see in more details below , the surfaces of support of @xmath4 field are always two - dimensional , independently of the dimension of the spacetime manifold .",
    "the second justification for considering the path integral over such distributional @xmath4 fields comes from the fact of existence of similar distributional solutions of the equations of motion in the classical theory .",
    "as it was shown by baez @xcite for the case of gravity , there exist solutions of the classical equations of motion in which the @xmath4 field is distributional and concentrated along two - dimensional surfaces in spacetime . in these solutions",
    "the @xmath4 field is zero except in a tubular neighborhood of a two - dimensional surface in spacetime .",
    "the connection field away from the surface then must be either arbitrary or flat , depending on the detailed form of the lagrangian of the theory .",
    "solutions of this type can be shown to exist for a large class of theories . here",
    "we take the fact of the existence of such solutions as a motivation for our construction .",
    "namely , we know that the simplest way to approach the computation of a path integral is to consider the semi - classical approximation",
    ". then the feynman path integral is evaluated as an integral over the classical moduli space ( space of classical solution ) with a measure given by the one loop expansion of the action around the classical solution . in this case",
    ", there may be different phases in the theory , and the type of solutions that dominate the path integral may be different in different phases .",
    "thus , there may exist a phase in a theory of the type we study where the path integral is dominated by the distributional solutions found by baez . at this point",
    "it is instructive to make an analogy with the usual yang - mills theories . in ( abelian ) yang - mills theories one also finds `` distributional '' solutions of the classical equations of motion : monopole solutions . in dirac",
    "s way @xcite of treating the monopole , it is described by a configuration of fields in which magnetic field is distributional along certain lines .",
    "distributional monopole solutions are not in the spectrum of perturbative quantum theory .",
    "however , one must include them when calculating the partition function of the theory via path integral method to reproduce correctly properties of certain phases of the theory , such as the confining phase .",
    "in fact , the confining phase of the theory is the one in which monopole solutions dominate the path integral @xcite .",
    "distributional solutions of the type discovered by baez @xcite are very similar in nature to monopole solutions .",
    "in fact , they are close to dual monopoles : electric field is distributional and concentrated along flux lines in space , instead of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , the analogy with monopole solutions suggests that one should include these distributional solutions when taking the path integral . in this paper",
    "we include _ only _ these distributional solutions , neglecting the usual smooth solutions playing the role in perturbative quantum theory .",
    "thus , we attempt to study the phase of various theories in which the distributional solutions dominate the path integral .",
    "this is the motivation for considering the path integral over distributional configurations of @xmath4 field .    the last but not least justification of our approach is the test of the procedure on the exact results coming from tqft s .",
    "as we shall see , for a large class of theories our approach gives results that are in a good agreement with the known state sum models .    in this paper",
    "we only calculate path integrals over the distributional fields `` living '' on a fixed collection of surfaces in spacetime . in the case of topological theories ,",
    "the result for a particular fixed collection of surfaces does not depend on the collection .",
    "one can not expect this property to hold for such theories as gravity , which is not a topological theory .",
    "thus , one might want to perform a sum over all possible collections of surfaces in spacetime , or take a limit as the triangulation becomes more refined .",
    "we do not address this , very important , problem in the present paper .",
    "usual interactive quantum field theories have been successfully understood using perturbative expansion in terms of feynman graphs . in this case",
    "the interacting qft is considered as a perturbation of a free field theory . from a technical point of view , what makes this approach successful is the exact solvability of the free field theory , i.e. , our ability to compute all possible correlation functions .",
    "this ability can be recasted into the knowledge of the generating functional , and feynman graphs can be viewed as the evaluation of certain differential operators acting on the generating functional .",
    "we will employ a somewhat similar strategy . in order to calculate transition amplitudes for our class of theories we will use the machinery of generating functionals . in our approach",
    "the role of the `` free '' field theory is played by the bf theory and the terms in the action polynomial in @xmath4 are analogous to the `` interaction '' terms .",
    "the idea to use the bf theory as a `` free '' field theory is not new : it has been applied with some success in the context of yang - mills theories ( see @xcite ) . however , the details of how the bf theory is used in our approach differ from those of @xcite . in order to calculate a transition amplitude , i.e. , the path integral of the exponentiated action @xmath19},\\ ] ] we formally rewrite this path integral as @xmath20\\right)_{j=0},\\ ] ] where @xmath21:=\\int { \\cal d}a { \\cal d}e \\,\\,e^{i\\int [ { \\rm tr}\\left ( e\\wedge f\\right ) +   { \\rm tr}\\left ( e\\wedge j\\right ) ] } .\\ ] ] we shall refer to @xmath22 $ ] as the _ generating functional_. here @xmath23 is a lie algebra valued two form field . using terminology from field theory we will call the @xmath23 field _ current_. one of our main results is the exact computation , in the context of spin foam models , of the generating functional @xmath24 .",
    "it is obtained by integrating over fields @xmath25 that `` live '' on a fixed triangulation of the spacetime manifold .",
    "then the transition amplitude for any theory of the type we consider is given as a formal power series in variational derivatives @xmath26 with respect to the current field .",
    "the series we get are quite reminiscent of the usual feynman diagram expansions .",
    "thus , the powerful technique of generating functionals allows us to study different theories  such as bf theory and gravity  from the same point of view .",
    "we note that , to the best of our knowledge , the technique of generating functionals has never before been used in the context of spin foam models .    in cases when the spacetime manifold is two , three and four - dimensional , for each fixed triangulation we find an explicit expression for the generating functional .",
    "we then use the obtained expressions to calculate the transition amplitudes for various theories .",
    "we find that our approach exactly reproduces the state sum models of 2d yang - mills and bf theory in any dimension . for bf theories with cosmological term",
    "we compare the amplitude obtained within our approach with the one given by the corresponding state sum model by decomposing them into the power series in the cosmological constant and comparing the first order terms .",
    "again , we find an agreement .",
    "we make some comments as to consequences of our results for the quantum gravity models in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "the paper consists of two main parts . in the first part , containing this section and sec.[sec : gf ] , we introduce the path integral techniques in the context of spin foam models . here",
    "we also introduce the generating functional , and compute it in various spacetime dimensions .",
    "the second part contains applications of the general techniques developed earlier to concrete theories .",
    "this also serves as a test of our approach , for one can compare the spin foam models obtained by our techniques with the known state sum models . in sec.[sec : th ] we define the class of theories that can be treated by techniques described in this paper , and give examples of physically interesting theories belonging to this class .",
    "sec.[sec : sf ] describes briefly some known state sum models and summarizes the known arguments that relate the state sum models to the classical theories .",
    "here we also obtain some properties of various state sum models that will be needed later . finally ,",
    "using the generating functional technique , we derive in sec.[sec : appl ] the spin foam models corresponding to various theories of sec.[sec : th ] and compare them with the known models .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "as we briefly explained in the introduction , to calculate transition amplitudes for a theory of the type we consider here it is very convenient to first calculate the generating functional of bf theory .",
    "then transition amplitudes can be obtained as formal power series in derivatives with respect to the current . in this section",
    "we calculate the generating functional of the bf theory , i.e. , the path integral @xmath27=\\int { \\cal d}a { \\cal d}e \\,\\,e^{i\\int [ { \\rm tr}\\left ( e\\wedge f\\right ) +   { \\rm tr}\\left ( e\\wedge j\\right ) ] } \\ ] ] in two , three and four spacetime dimensions .",
    "here @xmath15 is a connection on some @xmath28 bundle over the spacetime manifold @xmath8 , where @xmath28 is the gauge group of the theory , @xmath6 is the curvature 2-form of the connection , and @xmath29 are lie algebra valued ( d-2)-form fields , where d is the dimension of @xmath8 . for simplicity , we consider here only the case when the spacetime manifold @xmath8 is closed .",
    "we also restrict ourself to the case of the gauge group being @xmath30 .",
    "although for practical applications of spin foam models one is usually interested in the case when @xmath8 has a boundary consisting of `` initial '' and `` final '' spatial hypersurfaces , we do not consider this here because our main goal is to compare the spin foam models obtained by our techniques with the known state sum models , which can be done already in the case of closed @xmath8 . at any rate ,",
    "the inclusion of boundaries is straightforward , and all our formulas can be easily generalized to this case . to give meaning to the path integration over spacetime fields @xmath25 ,",
    "we replace the @xmath4 field by certain distributional field concentrated over two - dimensional surfaces in spacetime .",
    "to make contact with the known state sum models we put our fields on the 2-dimensional cellular complex dual to some triangulation of the spacetime manifold . in each particular calculation",
    "this triangulation is fixed and all results explicitly depend on it .",
    "we first investigate the generating functional in a general case , without specifying the dimension of spacetime manifold , and then find an explicit expression for it in each particular dimension .",
    "let us fix a triangulation @xmath31 of a d - dimensional compact oriented spacetime manifold @xmath32 .",
    "this triangulation defines another decomposition of @xmath32 into cells called dual complex .",
    "there is one - to - one correspondence between @xmath33-simplices of the triangulation and ( d  k)-cells in the dual complex .",
    "we orient each cell of the dual complex in an arbitrary fashion , which also defines an orientation for all simplices of the triangulation .",
    "the ( d2)-form @xmath4 can now be integrated over the ( d2)-simplices of the triangulation the result being a collection of the lie algebra elements @xmath34  one vector @xmath35 for each 2-cell dual to a ( d2)-simplex of the triangulation .",
    "we would like to discretize our model by replacing the continuous @xmath4 field by the collection of the lie algebra elements @xmath34 .",
    "it turns out , however , that this is not yet the most convenient set of variables for the theory . for reasons which we give below , we use another , more convenient set of variables introduced by reisenberger @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we will often call 2-cells of the dual triangulation _ dual faces_. instead of a single @xmath34 for each dual face , we introduce a set of variables , which we call @xmath36 .",
    "to do this , we divide each dual face into what reisenberger calls `` wedges '' ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . to construct wedges of the dual face",
    "one first has to find the `` center '' of the dual face .",
    "this is the point on the dual face where it intersects with the corresponding ( d2)-simplex of the triangulation .",
    "one then has to draw lines connecting this center with the centers of the neighboring dual faces .",
    "the part of the dual face that lies between two such lines is exactly the wedge .",
    "thus , each dual face splits into wedges , and we assign a lie algebra element @xmath36 to each wedge @xmath37 .",
    "all variables @xmath36 that correspond to a single dual face are required to have the same length .",
    "recall that vectors of the same length only differ by a gauge transformation .",
    "wedges of a given dual face are in one - to - one correspondence with the d - simplices of the triangulation neighboring this dual face .",
    "thus , the physical meaning of each variable @xmath36 can be said to be the integral of @xmath4 over the ( d2 ) simplex of the triangulation `` from the point of view '' of a particular d - simplex containing this ( d2)-simplex .",
    "in other words , with the introduction of the wedge variables @xmath36 we allow integrals of @xmath4 over one and the same ( d2)-simplex of triangulation to be different when this simplex is considered as belonging to different d - simplices , as long as lengths of all such @xmath36 coincide . note that the number of variables @xmath36 that arises this way for a given triangulation is equal to the number of d - simplices times the number of ( d2)-simplices in each d - simplex .",
    "having discussed the geometrical meaning of the wedge variables @xmath36 we are ready to introduce the distributional @xmath4 fields .",
    "heuristically , our procedure of replacement of a smooth @xmath4 field by a distribution concentrated along the wedges amounts to `` squeezing '' of the smooth @xmath4 field that is `` spread '' over a ( d-2 ) simplex of the triangulation to a single point on this ( d-2 ) simplex , the point where the simplex intersects with the 2-cell of the dual complex .",
    "thus , we define a distributional field @xmath38 concentrated along a wedge @xmath37 to be a 2-form satisfying the following relation : @xmath39 here @xmath23 is any @xmath40-valued 2-form , and @xmath37 stands for a wedge .",
    "the integral on the right - hand - side is performed over the wedge @xmath37 .",
    "this , in particular , implies that the lie algebra element @xmath36 is equal to the integral of @xmath38 over the ( d2)-simplex of the triangulation that is dual to the 2-cell @xmath41 .",
    "we then define distributional field @xmath4 to be @xmath42    although with the introduction of the wedge variables we have increased the number of independent variables in the theory , one can still argue that the physical content of the theory should be the same because the norm of all the @xmath36 belonging to one and the same dual face are required to be equal . for the case of bf theory one can directly prove that the introduction of the independent wedge variables does not change the theory in the case the topology of dual faces @xmath41",
    "is that of a disc , which is what we will assume here . for more complicated theories with non - zero `` interaction '' term ( the term in the action that makes the theory to be different from the bf theory ) ,",
    "the wedge variables are so indispensable that it is not clear whether one can even define the theory without these variables .",
    "it is interesting , however , that , even in the case of bf theory one _ has _ to use the wedge variables if one wants to reproduce a triangulation - independent state sum model for the case the topology of @xmath41 is different from that of a disc .",
    "this serves as a strong motivation for considering the wedge variables .",
    "another motivation for using them is , as we explain below , that the wedge variables appear naturally when one tries to implement the gauge symmetry in the theory .",
    "also , as we shall see , using these variables we will be able to reproduce the well - known state sum models in various dimensions .",
    "thus , we are going to use the set of wedge variables motivated , in particular , by the results we obtain .    the discretization we consider is consistent with the results of the canonical approach .",
    "the restriction of @xmath4 constructed as described above to a generic `` spatial '' ( ( d1)-dimensional ) slice @xmath43 of @xmath32 is non - zero only along edges of the graph @xmath44 in @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the intersection of the dual complex with @xmath43 .",
    "thus , this `` discretization '' realizes rather explicitly faraday s idea of lines of electric force .",
    "indeed , the restriction of @xmath4 on a spatial hypersurface can be described as a collection of flux lines of non - abelian electric field .",
    "it is not hard to see what states would correspond to such @xmath4 in the quantum theory .",
    "recall that the quantum states are functionals @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 is the pullback of the connection field @xmath15 on the spatial hypersurface @xmath43 .",
    "the densitized vector field @xmath47 ( that is dual to @xmath48 ) becomes the operator of variational derivative with respect to @xmath46 . in order for @xmath47 in a state",
    "@xmath45 $ ] to be zero everywhere except along the edges of @xmath44 the state @xmath16 should depend on the values of the connection @xmath46 only along the edges .",
    "note also that our construction of the distributional @xmath4 field gives us @xmath47 whose length is constant along each edge .",
    "this means that the state @xmath16 can depend on the values of @xmath46 only as a function of the holonomies of the connection along the edges .",
    "these are exactly the states one finds in the canonical approach to quantum theory , as we explained in the introduction .",
    "to calculate the generating functional @xmath24 as a function of a fixed triangulation @xmath31 , we have to take the integral of the exponentiated action over the `` discretized '' dynamical fields @xmath25 , that is , the fields `` living '' on the triangulation @xmath31 .",
    "the `` discretized '' action , that is , the action evaluated on the distributional field @xmath4 , becomes a function of the lie algebra elements @xmath34 , and a functional of connection @xmath15 and current @xmath23 . using ( [ distr]),([distr-1 ] ) , we find that this discretized action is given by @xmath49,\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over the wedges of faces of the dual complex ( ` w ' stands here for a wedge ) , and the integral is performed over each wedge , the integrand being the curvature of the connection @xmath15 contracted with the lie algebra element @xmath36 `` living '' on that wedge plus the current @xmath23 contracted with @xmath36 .",
    "each integral is performed using the orientation of the dual face to which the wedge belongs .",
    "we could now substitute this discretized action into the path integral and integrate over @xmath34 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , we first have to discuss what measure has to be used to integrate over @xmath50 . to give meaning to the integration over @xmath15 ,",
    "let us replace a continuous field @xmath15 by a collection of group elements .",
    "to do this we use the following approximation @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the lie algebra element corresponding to the holonomy of @xmath15 around the wedge ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . the base point of the holonomy",
    "is not fixed at this stage ( see below ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath53    where @xmath54 are the holonomies of @xmath15 along the four edges that form the boundary of the wedge @xmath37 .",
    "we assume a local trivialization of the bundle over @xmath37 so that the holonomies are group elements .",
    "the order in which the product of group elements is taken is determined by the orientation of the dual face .",
    "of course , @xmath55 is defined only up to its conjugacy class ( any of the four edges can be taken to be the `` first '' ) . thus , there is an ambiguity in the choice of the base point for the holonomy , which we have to fix in some way . to fix it",
    "we define a notion of `` discretized '' gauge transformation and fix the ambiguity requiring the discrete action to be gauge invariant .    but",
    "first , let us replace the continuous current field @xmath23 by a collection of lie algebra elements @xmath56 : @xmath57 here , to perform the integration , a trivialization of the bundle over the wedge @xmath37 is chosen .",
    "the discretized action now becomes @xmath58 we fix a definition of @xmath52 in such a way that this action is gauge invariant .",
    "we define the discrete gauge transformation so that it `` acts '' in the center of each d - simplex .",
    "more precisely , a gauge transformation is parameterized by a collection of group elements : a group element @xmath59 for each d - simplex .",
    "first of all , the gauge transformation is defined for the holonomy @xmath60 of the connection along any loop that starts and finishes at the center @xmath61 of the d - simplex .",
    "the transformation is as follows : @xmath62 the wedge variables @xmath36 and the discrete current variables @xmath56 transform as @xmath63 with this definition @xmath64 is gauge invariant only when @xmath65 is defined as the holonomy around the wedge @xmath37 whose starting and final point is the center @xmath61 of the d - simplex , as in ( [ z ] ) .",
    "this fixes the ambiguity in @xmath52 . with @xmath52",
    "defined this way the discretized action is gauge invariant .",
    "the approximation ( [ approx ] ) is good for @xmath52 close to zero element in the lie algebra .",
    "thus , this approximation is certainly justified for bf theory , where we expect only connections close to flat to matter in the quantum theory .",
    "it is harder to justify this approximation for theories , for which the classical equations of motion do not imply the connection to be flat , as is the case , for example , for bf theory with cosmological term or for gravity .",
    "however , even for such theories , one would expect the approximation ( [ approx ] ) become better as the triangulation of the manifold becomes finer and the dual faces become smaller . in quantum gravity",
    "we expect finer triangulations to matter most , which can serve as a justification for the above approximation in the case of gravity .",
    "the approximation ( [ approx ] ) will be additionally justified when we discuss the problem of the integration over @xmath36 variables . to define the",
    "later we will refer to a certain standard field theory calculation for bf theory in two dimensions .",
    "as we shall see , the approximation ( [ approx ] ) is quite natural from the point of view of 2d bf theory .",
    "the approximation ( [ approx ] ) finishes the discretization procedure for the classical action .",
    "we can now calculate the path integral for the generating functional @xmath24 by integrating the exponentiated discrete action ( [ disw ] ) over the lie algebra elements @xmath36 and group elements @xmath66 .",
    "this path integral is given by @xmath67 here the integrals are taken over all group elements @xmath66 , entering the expression through @xmath52 , see ( [ approx ] ) .",

    "let us now investigate the structure of the path integral ( [ pathintbf ] ) . to calculate @xmath24 we have to find the function of @xmath74 that is given by @xmath75 in fact",
    ", it is not hard to see that this function is proportional to the @xmath76-function of @xmath55 peaked at @xmath77 .",
    "the proportionality coefficient can be a gauge invariant function of @xmath56 .",
    "as we explain below , this function must be set to be equal to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the function that relates lebesgue measure on the lie algebra and haar measure on the group ( see the appendix b ) .",
    "thus , as the result of ( [ 1 ] ) we get : @xmath80 where @xmath76 is the standard @xmath76-function on the group .",
    "thus , the function of @xmath81 given by ( [ 1 ] ) can be written as @xmath82 where we used the well - known decomposition of @xmath76-function on the group into the sum over characters @xmath83 of irreducible representation . here",
    "the sum is taken over all irreducible representations of @xmath71 ( labelled by spins @xmath84 ) , and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath86 the integration over the group elements can now be easily performed using the well - known formulas for the integrals of the products of matrix elements .",
    "however , let us first give a systematic derivation of the result ( [ 2 ] ) .    to find the result of the integral ( [ 1 ] ) we relate it to a more complicated integral , for which a precise result is known from 2d bf theory calculation .",
    "recall that so far the measure @xmath87 in ( [ 1 ] ) is unspecified .",
    "the following relation to 2d bf theory will also serve the purpose of specifying this measure .",
    "let us restrict our attention to a particular wedge @xmath37 .",
    "we can restrict the bundle @xmath88 to @xmath37 and get an @xmath71 bundle @xmath89 over @xmath37 .",

    "the path integral ( [ bf1 ] ) is just a partition function of bf theory on the disk with the distributional source given by ( [ source ] ) .",
    "this partition function can be derived using results of @xcite .",
    "the result is given by ( [ 2 ] ) , where @xmath52 is the lie algebra element that corresponds to the holonomy of @xmath15 along the boundary of @xmath37 .",
    "we will not present this calculation here .",
    "instead , we refer to the calculation performed in @xcite for the partition function of 2d bf theory on a punctured sphere .",
    "the result ( [ 2 ] ) can then be checked by taking the partition function on the disk ( equal to @xmath94 , where @xmath59 is the holonomy along the boundary of the disk ) , and integrating it with ( [ 2 ] ) over @xmath69 .",
    "this must give the partition function on a punctured sphere , and indeed reproduces the result given in @xcite .",
    "the only cautionary remark we have to make is that the calculation performed in @xcite finds a gauge invariant partition function , that is , the one in which one takes @xmath95 and integrates over @xmath96 .",
    "the techniques developed in @xcite can be used only to calculate gauge invariant quantities , and are not directly applicable to the integral ( [ bf1 ] ) .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , using the results of @xcite one can only argue that ( [ bf1 ] ) is equal to @xmath97 where @xmath98 is some group element .",
    "to get rid of @xmath98 in this expression , and , thus , to get ( [ 2 ] ) , we will recall how `` discretized '' gauge transformations act on the lie algebra elements @xmath81 , see ( [ g - discr1]),([g - discr2 ] ) .",
    "the result of ( [ 1 ] ) must be invariant under this gauge transformations .",
    "it is not hard to see that this fixes @xmath98 above to be unity , thus , giving ( [ 2 ] ) .",

    "it is not hard to show that @xmath103 where the integral over @xmath15 is taken with @xmath15 on the boundary of @xmath37 fixed , is approximated by @xmath104 where @xmath55 is the holonomy of @xmath15 along the boundary of @xmath37 . putting this back to ( [ bf2 ] ) one gets exactly ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this finishes our discussion of the derivation of ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "having discussed the derivation of the expression ( [ k2 ] ) for the generating functional , we can now perform the integrals over the group elements .",
    "integration over the group elements @xmath98 that correspond to edges dividing dual faces into wedges is the same in any dimension , and we perform it here .",
    "the rest of the group elements corresponds to edges that form the boundary of the dual faces .",
    "the integration over these group elements @xmath59 is different in different dimensions , and we perform it in the following subsections . each group element @xmath98 is `` shared '' by two wedges ; thus , we have to take the integral of the product of two matrix elements .",
    "such an integral is given by ( [ a1 ] ) of the appendix .",
    "integrating over all these edges , and making a simple change of variables to eliminate trivial integrations , we find @xmath105 here the remaining integrals are over the group elements @xmath106 that correspond to the edges @xmath107 of the dual complex ( edges that connect centers of 4-simplices ) . the second product is taken over the dual faces @xmath41 ; @xmath108 is the spin labelling the dual face @xmath41 , @xmath109 is the euler characteristics of @xmath41 .",
    "it is equal to unity in case the dual face has the topology of a disc . in what follows",
    "we will always assume that this is the case .",
    "the order of the group elements in the argument of @xmath110 is clear from the figure 4 .",
    "note that in the integration we just performed survived only the terms for which the spins of all wedges corresponding to one and the same dual face are equal . in ( [ k1 ] ) this spin , which is the same for all wedges belonging to the same dual face , is denoted by @xmath108 .",
    "as one can see from the formula ( [ iftr ] ) for the inverse fourier transform , the spin labelling a wedge in ( [ k2 ] ) has the meaning of the length of the corresponding lie algebra element @xmath34 .",
    "thus , as we said above , there is no need to impose the constraint that length of all wedge variables @xmath36 belonging to one and the same dual face are equal : this constraint gets imposed automatically when the integration over the group elements is performed .",
    "the expression ( [ k1 ] ) for the generating functional can be further simplified by integrating over the group elements @xmath106 .",
    "however , the result of this integration is different in different dimensions , and we will perform it separately for each particular case .",
    "before we calculate the generating functional for each particular spacetime dimension , let us pause to discuss some general properties of the expression for @xmath111 .",
    "the generating functional has several symmetries which we describe as follows .",
    "first , the generating functional is invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "namely , let us consider a transformation @xmath112 , where @xmath113 denotes the d - simplex of @xmath31 to which @xmath37 belongs .",
    "here @xmath114 is the same for all @xmath37 belonging to the simplex @xmath98 .",
    "the generating functional ( [ pathintbf ] ) satisfies :",
    "@xmath115 this `` discrete '' gauge transformation is parameterized by one group element for each d - simplex of @xmath31 . however the expression ( [ k1 ] ) for the generating functional has a bigger invariance .",
    "namely , let us denote by @xmath116 the two edges of the wedge @xmath37 which meet at the center of the d - simplex @xmath113 .",
    "let us associate with each edge @xmath117 a group element @xmath118 so that it is one and the same for different wedges @xmath37 when @xmath117 is one and the same .",
    "the transformation of all currents according to @xmath119 leaves the generating functional invariant .",
    "this transformation , which is parameterized by @xmath120 group elements per simplex , contains the gauge transformation as its particular case .",
    "the later corresponds to @xmath121 for all @xmath37 that belong to @xmath98 .",
    "the appearance and significance of the described extra symmetry is not yet clear to us .",
    "the generating functional is covariant under the diffeomorphism group .",
    "let @xmath122 denote a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifold @xmath32 , and denote by @xmath123 the image of the embedded triangulation @xmath31 under the diffeomorphism .",
    "if @xmath124 , let us denote @xmath125 .",
    "then @xmath126 the generating functional is generally not invariant under a refinement of the triangulation @xmath31 unless the theory is a topological field theory ( unless @xmath127 ) .    to define the generating functional we had to choose an arbitrary orientation of the wedges .",
    "however , the generating functional is independent of the orientation chosen .",
    "if one , for example , reverses the orientation of the wedge @xmath128 this results : ( i ) in the change @xmath129 into @xmath130 ; ( ii ) it changes the holonomy of the connection along the wedge into its inverse .",
    "the two effects cancel each other leaving the generating functional invariant .",
    "the case of two spacetime dimensions is somewhat special in the sense that dual faces ( 2-cells ) cover the manifold ( see fig .",
    "the general construction of the previous subsection prescribes to replace the continuous field @xmath4 , which in the case of two dimensions is a zero form , by a distributional field concentrated along dual faces .",
    "however , since the spacetime is two - dimensional , the dual faces cover the manifold , and we just have to replace the @xmath4 field by a field constant on each wedge , and equal to the lie algebra element @xmath36 .",
    "let us now see that it is quite a reasonable thing to do from the point of view of the canonical quantum theory . in the case",
    "@xmath8 is compact , which is the case of interest for us here , a spatial slice @xmath43 of @xmath8 consists of a finite number of circles @xmath131",
    ". the states of the canonical theory are just class functions of the holonomies of @xmath46 , which is the pullback of @xmath15 on @xmath43 , around this circles .",
    "the corresponding field @xmath48 , which in the quantum theory becomes the operator of variational derivative with respect to @xmath46 , has thus a constant norm along each disjoint component of @xmath43 .",
    "it thus makes sense to replace the @xmath4 field by a collection of lie algebra elements @xmath36 constant on each wedge .",
    "moreover , as we shall see , the integration over group elements @xmath106 in ( [ k1 ] ) renders all @xmath36 to have the same norm in each disjoint component of @xmath8 , which is in agreement with what we get in the canonical approach .",
    "the group elements @xmath106 in ( [ k1 ] ) are `` shared '' by two dual faces .",
    "thus , all integrals over @xmath106 in ( [ k1 ] ) have as the integrand the product of two matrix elements of @xmath106 .",
    "these can be taken using the formula ( [ a1 ] ) of the appendix . to describe the result of this integration",
    "we will assume that @xmath8 has a single connected component .",
    "then the generating functional in two dimensions is given by the following expression @xmath132 in the integration over the group elements @xmath106 in ( [ k1 ] ) survive only the terms in which all spins @xmath108 are equal .",
    "this spin is denoted by @xmath84 in ( [ z2d ] ) .",
    "the symbols @xmath133 stand in ( [ z2d ] ) for number of vertices and number of edges in the triangulation correspondingly . the product here",
    "is taken over all centers of faces of @xmath31 , or , equivalently , over faces @xmath122 .",
    "the graphical notation stands for @xmath134 where @xmath135 are the three lie algebra elements ( currents ) `` shared '' by the face @xmath122 . recall that in two dimensions each face is just a union of three wedges , and @xmath135 are the currents @xmath56 corresponding to these wedges ( see fig .",
    "[ gr1 ]    the expression ( [ z2d ] ) is the final result for the generating functional in two dimensions .",
    "note that the graph in this graphical representation of the character can be obtained as a result of the following simple construction .",
    "let us draw a circle @xmath131 centered at the center of the face ( see fig .",
    "the intersection of wedges with the circle gives the circle itself .",
    "the intersection of this circle with the dual edges gives three points on the circle .",
    "each wedge is labelled by a spin @xmath84 , which is the same for all wedges , and we can assign a label @xmath84 to the circle that intersects the three wedges .",
    "then the face contribution to ( [ z2d ] ) , that is , the contribution that we graphically represent by ( [ gr1 ] ) , is simply the _ spin network _ constructed with the labelled circle , with insertion of the three group elements @xmath136 at the points where the circle is intersected by the corresponding wedges .",
    "this construction is trivial in two dimensions , but turns out to be generalizable to any dimension .",
    "the three - dimensional case is more interesting . here",
    "the dual faces no longer cover the spacetime manifold , and the @xmath4 field acquires a true distributional character .",
    "the general construction prescribes to replace the @xmath4 field , which is now a one - form , by a distribution concentrated along dual faces and constant along the wedges .",
    "it is illustrative to give a coordinate expression for such a distributional field .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary wedge @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "let @xmath137 be the equation of a plane containing @xmath37 .",
    "then the field @xmath4 that has the correct distributional character is given by the expression @xmath138    to calculate the generating functional let us note that each edge of the dual triangulation belongs to three dual faces .",
    "thus , in ( [ k1 ] ) , one has to take integrals over products of three matrix elements .",
    "the corresponding formula is given in the appendix [ appha ] .",
    "the result of this integration can be described as a generalization of the `` circle '' construction given at the end of the previous subsection .",
    "let us draw a sphere @xmath139 centered at the center of each tetrahedron .",
    "the wedges belonging to a particular tetrahedron intersect the sphere and draw a graph on its surface .",
    "we will refer to this graph as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 refers to a tetrahedron of the triangulation that was used to construct @xmath140 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath140 is a tetrahedron whose vertices come from the intersection of the sphere with the dual edges . the same graph @xmath140 can also be obtained by looking at the boundary of tetrahedron @xmath141 ( this boundary has the topology of @xmath139 ) , which is triangulated by the faces of @xmath141 , and constructing the graph dual to the triangulation of this @xmath139 .",
    "the resulting tetrahedron is the same as that in the previous construction with a sphere .    in ( [ k1 ] )",
    "the sum is taken over spins @xmath108 labelling the dual faces . the result of the integration over the group elements @xmath106 will still be a sum over spins @xmath108 .",
    "each wedge belongs to some dual face , and , thus , is labelled by spin .",
    "as we have just seen the edges of @xmath140 are in one - to - one correspondence with the wedges .",
    "let us label these edges with the same spins as those of the corresponding wedges .",
    "we have a current @xmath56 associated with each of the 6 wedges belonging to tetrahedron @xmath141 .",
    "let us denote this currents by @xmath142 .",
    "we can now construct a function of the group elements @xmath143 that is just a spin network function .",
    "the generating functional in three dimensions is then given by the following expression @xmath144 where the sum is over all possible coloring of dual faces .",
    "this is the final expression we are going to use in the following section in order to derive spin foam models .",
    "the case of four dimensions is analogous to the just analyzed case of three dimensions .",
    "the only difference is that it is harder to visualize a four - dimensional triangulated manifold , and that the final expression for the generating functional is more complicated .",
    "however , the final result for the generating functional follows the same pattern .",
    "first , let us give a coordinate expression for the distributional field @xmath4 in four dimensions .",
    "let @xmath145 be two functions such that @xmath146 is the equation for a 2-surface in @xmath32 containing one of the faces @xmath41 of the dual complex , and @xmath147 is positive as defined by the orientation of @xmath41 .",
    "we then define @xmath4 to be equal to @xmath148 on each wedge @xmath37 , and to be equal to zero everywhere else .",
    "we repeat this construction for all wedges , and add all these distributional forms together to get a two - form that is concentrated along the faces of the dual complex .",
    "then the integral of such distributional @xmath4 over a wedge of the triangulation is equal simply to @xmath36 corresponding to that wedge .",
    "let us now describe the result of integration over the group elements @xmath106 in ( [ k1 ] ) . in four dimensions",
    "each dual edge is shared by four dual faces .",
    "thus , one has to take the integral of the product of four matrix elements .",
    "the required formula is given in appendix  [ appha ] .",
    "the result of this integration can again be described using a certain spin network function of the group elements corresponding to the currents @xmath56 . as in the case of two and three dimensions ,",
    "let us introduce special graphs in the vicinity of the center of each 4-simplex @xmath98 , which we will call @xmath149 .",
    "we define graph @xmath149 as the intersection of the sphere @xmath150 surrounding the center of 4-simplex @xmath98 with the dual faces @xmath41 .",
    "the graph @xmath149 lives in @xmath150 , but it can be projected on a plane .",
    "this gives us the pentagon graph .",
    "note that at this stage we do not care about types of crossings we get ( that is , whether this is under- or over - crossing ) .",
    "the edges of this graph are in one - to - one correspondence with the wedges @xmath37 belonging to the 4-simplex @xmath98 .",
    "thus , we can associate to each edge a current @xmath56 , and label it with the spin @xmath108 labelling the dual face to which the corresponding wedge belongs .",
    "additionally , let us label each of five vertices of the pentagon by a half - integer ( spin ) .",
    "vertices of the pentagon are in one - to - one correspondence with tetrahedra of the triangulation .",
    "thus , we shall use the notation @xmath151 for this spins .    inside each four - simplex",
    "there are 10 wedges .",
    "let us denote the corresponding currents by @xmath152 .",
    "one can then construct the function of the group elements @xmath153 .",
    "the generating functional @xmath154 is given by the sum over spins of products over 4-simplices of the above functions of the currents @xmath56 @xmath155 here @xmath98 labels 4-simplices of the triangulation and @xmath108 are spins labelling the dual faces .",
    "the resolution of each vertex in this pentagon graph is given in the appendix [ appha ] .",
    "having calculated the generating functional in various spacetime dimensions we are in the position to use our results to study concrete theories .",
    "however , let us first specify in more details the class of theories that can be treated within our approach , and give physically interesting examples of theories belonging to this class . in this paper we will restrict our attention to a special class of theories . for simplicity",
    "we fix the gauge group to be @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath32 be an oriented smooth d - dimensional manifold , and let @xmath79 be an @xmath71-bundle over @xmath32 .",
    "the basic fields of a theory of interest are a connection @xmath15 on @xmath79 , and an @xmath156-valued ( d-2)-form , often called @xmath5 , which we call @xmath4 because of its relation with the @xmath71 `` electric '' field of the canonical formulation of the theory .",
    "the action of the theory is of the form @xmath157=\\int_\\m \\left [ { \\rm tr}\\left ( e\\wedge f \\right ) + \\phi(e)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the curvature of @xmath15 , ` tr ' is the trace in the fundamental representation of @xmath71 , and @xmath7 is a gauge invariant polynomial function that depends on @xmath4 but not on its derivatives .",
    "also , @xmath158 should be a d - form so that it can be integrated .",
    "it can also depend on other dynamical fields , for example lagrange multipliers as in the case of gravity , or on additional non - dynamical fields ( background structure ) , as in the case of yang - mills theories .",
    "let us now give examples of theories belonging to this class .",
    "the action of bf theory in any dimension is given by @xmath159 that is , this is the action of the type ( [ type ] ) with zero `` interaction '' term @xmath7 .",
    "the equations of motion that follow from this action state that @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the covariant derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the flat connections play the dominant role in bf theory .",
    "yang - mills action can be written only if one introduces a background metric on @xmath8 . however , in two spacetime dimensions , yang - mills action turns out to depend only on a measure ( area two - form ) defined by the metric on @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we will keep track only of this dependence of the action on a measure @xmath162 on @xmath8 .",
    "yang - mills theory in 2d is described by the following bf - like action @xmath163 here @xmath4 is a lie - algebra valued zero - form , @xmath6 is the curvature of the connection @xmath15 . solving equations of motion for @xmath4 that follow from this action , and substituting the solution into the action , one can check that the action reduces to the standard yang - mills action @xmath164 where @xmath165 is a metric ( of euclidean signature ) on @xmath8 such that @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the square root of the determinant of the metric .",
    "using the techniques developed in this paper , one can calculate the vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude of this theory , that is the path integral of @xmath168 . however , an interesting feature of this theory is that the same techniques can be used to calculate the _ partition function _ ,",
    "that is , the path integral @xmath169 the problem of calculation of the partition function can be reduced to the problem of calculation of the vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude of a somewhat different theory , that is of the path integral of @xmath168 , with the action given by @xmath170 indeed , integrating over @xmath4 in the path integral of @xmath168 , one gets ( [ ym1 ] ) . as one can see , the two actions ( [ ym2]),([ym3 ] ) differ by the factor of @xmath171 in front of the second term . using the two actions ( [ ym2]),([ym3 ] ) we will calculate below both the vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude and partition function of the theory .      in three dimensions",
    "the @xmath4 field of bf theory is a one - form , and one can add a term cubic in @xmath4 to the bf action to obtain @xmath172 where @xmath8 is assumed to be a three - dimensional orientable manifold . the action is a functional of an @xmath71 connection @xmath15 , whose curvature form is denoted by @xmath6 , and a 1-form @xmath4 , which takes values in the lie algebra of @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the action ( [ bf3daction ] ) is that of bf theory in 3d , with @xmath4 field playing the role of @xmath5 , and with an additional `` cosmological term '' added to the usual bf action .",
    "this theory is related to gravity in 3d as follows .",
    "having the one - form @xmath4 , one can construct from it a real metric of euclidean signature @xmath173 here @xmath174 stand for spacetime indices : @xmath175 .",
    "we take the @xmath4 field to be anti - hermitian , which explains the minus sign in ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath4 field in ( [ bf3daction ] ) has the interpretation of the triad field .",
    "one of the equations of motion that follows from ( [ bf3daction ] ) states that @xmath15 is the spin connection compatible with the triad @xmath4 . taking the @xmath4 field to be non - degenerate and `` right - handed '' , i.e. , giving a positive - definite volume form @xmath176 and substituting into ( [ bf3daction ] ) the spin connection instead of @xmath15 , one gets the euclidean einstein - hilbert action @xmath177 we use units in which @xmath178 .",
    "the minus in front of ( [ bf3daction ] ) is needed to yield precisely the einstein - hilbert action after the elimination of @xmath15 .",

    "an important difference of this theory and einstein s theory is the fact bf theory , unlike gravity , is defined for degenerate metrics .      in four spacetime dimensions",
    "the @xmath4 field of bf theory is a two - form .",
    "thus , one can construct the following action functional @xmath180 where @xmath179 is a real parameter , which we will refer to as the `` cosmological constant '' .",
    "if one , as in the following subsection , adds to this action an additional constraint that @xmath4 is simple , that is , given by a product of two one - forms , then this theory is equivalent to einstein s theory and @xmath179 is proportional to the `` physical '' cosmological constant .",
    "the action for euclidean general relativity in the self - dual first order formalism is given by @xcite @xmath181 where , to write @xmath182 , we have introduced a basis in the lie algebra of @xmath71 .",
    "here @xmath183 is a symmetric matrix of lagrange multipliers .",

    "the action reduces to the self - dual hilbert - palatini action for 4-dimensional gravity and @xmath188 correspond to the components of the self - dual part of the weyl curvature tensor .",
    "thus , ( [ sdgraction ] ) is the bf action in four dimensions , with an additional `` simplicity '' constraint added to it .",
    "in this section we present state sum models for the theories we just described .",
    "these models give an expression for the vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude of bf theory , i.e. , the path integral @xmath189 as a sum over colored triangulations .",
    "more precisely , let us fix a triangulation @xmath31 of @xmath8 . in three dimensions ,",
    "let us label the edges of @xmath31 by irreducible representations of @xmath71 , that is , by spins @xmath84 .",
    "thus , to each edge @xmath190 we assign a label @xmath191 .",

    "note that the sum over spins in ( [ pr ] ) diverges . to make sense of it",
    "one must introduce a regularization .",
    "a possible regularization is given by the turaev - viro model , which we discuss below .",
    "after the introduction of this `` regularization '' , this sum can be shown to be triangulation independent .",
    "thus , ( [ pr ] ) gives an invariant of @xmath8 : @xmath195 .    in four dimensions",
    "one can construct a similar sum by labelling the faces of @xmath31 .",
    "let us denote the spin labelling a face @xmath122 by @xmath196 .",
    "let us consider the following quantity : @xmath197 after a certain `` regularization '' ( given by the crane - yetter model below ) that gives sense to the infinite sums in ( [ o ] ) , this can be shown to be triangulation independent : @xmath198 . in ( [ o ] )",
    "one has introduced an additional label @xmath151 for each tetrahedron of @xmath31 .",
    "the spin @xmath151 labels an intertwiner one has to assign to each tetrahedron ( see the subsection on crane - yetter model for details ) . the last product is taken over the 4-simplices @xmath98 of @xmath31 .",

    "as was realized by ooguri @xcite , these models give a `` discrete '' realization of the path integral because they can be obtained from the requirement that the connection on @xmath8 is flat .",
    "indeed , formally the path integral ( [ zbf ] ) is equal to @xmath200 the state sums ( [ pr]),([o ] ) are in certain precise sense realizations of the integral over connections with the integrand being the delta - function at @xmath201 .",
    "migdal @xcite has studied the yang - mills theory on a lattice , and , in particular , has proposed a lattice model for the yang - mills theory in two dimensions .",
    "this model was later studied by witten @xcite in the connection with topological field theories in two dimensions .",
    "as we discussed above , the problem of calculation of the yang - mills partition function can be reduced to the problem of calculation of the path integral @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the total area of @xmath8 , and other notations are explained in subsection ( [ sec : ymcl ] ) .",

    "let us triangulate our two - dimensional manifold @xmath8 , and introduce the dual triangulation ( see fig . 5 ) .",

    "@xmath106 the partition function takes the following simple form : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the euler characteristics of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , as we indicated in the argument of ym , the partition function depends only on the topological properties of @xmath211 .",
    "also , the dependence on measure @xmath162 enters only through the dependence on the total area @xmath203 of @xmath8 .",
    "the turaev - viro model gives a way to calculate the transition amplitude of the theory defined by ( [ bf3daction ] ) , i.e. , the path integral @xmath212 in this paper we consider only vacuum - vacuum amplitudes .",
    "although the turaev - viro model can be used to calculate more general amplitudes between non - trivial initial and final states , we will not use this aspect of the model here .",
    "we consider the version of the model formulated on a triangulated manifold .",
    "thus , let us fix a triangulation @xmath31 of @xmath8 .",
    "let us label the edges , for which we will employ the notation @xmath190 , by irreducible representations of the quantum group @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is a root of unity @xmath215 later we will relate the parameter @xmath216 with the cosmological constant @xmath179 .",
    "the irreducible representations of @xmath213 are labelled by half - integers ( spins ) @xmath84 satisfying @xmath217 .",
    "thus , we associate a spin @xmath191 to each edge @xmath190 .",
    "the vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude of the theory is then given by the following expression ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath218 where @xmath219 and the so - called quantum dimension @xmath220 are defined in the appendix a by ( [ eta ] ) and ( [ qdim ] ) correspondingly , and @xmath221 is the number of vertices in @xmath31 .",

[",
    "sec : appl ] the spin foam model obtained via our techniques with the turaev - viro model , we will need the first - order term in the decomposition of ( [ tv ] ) in the power series in @xmath179 .",
    "this is proportional to the expectation value of the spacetime volume in bf theory at @xmath230 .",
    "indeed , the expectation value of the volume is given simply by the derivative of the amplitude ( [ z ] ) with respect to @xmath231 evaluated at @xmath230 : @xmath232 thus , the expectation value of the volume of @xmath8 in bf theory is proportional to the first order term in @xmath179 in the decomposition of ( [ tv ] ) .",
    "let us find this expectation value .",
    "an important subtlety arises here .",
    "it is not hard to show that ( [ tv ] ) has the following asymptotic expansion in @xmath216 @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the amplitude of the ponzano - regge model ( [ pr ] ) @xmath221 is the number of vertices in @xmath31 , and @xmath235 is a real quantity independent of @xmath216 .",
    "thus , apparently there is no term proportional to @xmath236 in this expansion .",
    "however , as it is explained , for example , in @xcite , the state sum invariant ( [ tv ] ) does not exactly give the transition amplitude of bf theory .",
    "instead , the turaev - viro amplitude is only proportional to the bf amplitude , and the proportionality coefficient depends on @xmath216 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the integration over @xmath237 , which is carried out to obtain @xmath238 in ( [ tv - cs ] ) and thus the turaev - viro amplitude , is different from the integration over @xmath25 one has to perform to obtain ( [ zbfl3d ] ) .",
    "the difference in the integration measures is a power of @xmath216 .",
    "thus , the amplitude ( [ zbfl3d ] ) and the squared absolute value of the amplitude of the chern - simons theory are proportional to each other with the coefficient of proportionality being a power of @xmath216 . in the discretized version of the theory , given by the turaev - viro model ,",
    "this power of @xmath216 is replaced by @xmath239 .",
    "thus , the turaev - viro amplitude , in the limit of small cosmological constant , differs from the bf amplitude by a power of @xmath239 .",
    "this remark being made , we can write an expression for the expectation value of the volume in bf theory : @xmath240 where the function @xmath241 of the triangulation @xmath31 and the labels @xmath242 is given by @xmath243 here @xmath244 stands for vertices of @xmath31 , @xmath190 stands for edges and @xmath141 stands for tetrahedra . we intentionally wrote the expectation value of the volume in the form ( [ vol - exp ] ) to introduce the volume @xmath241 of a labelled triangulation , which will be of interest to us in what follows .",
    "indeed , ( [ vol - exp ] ) has the form @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the amplitude of ponzano - regge model .",
    "this shows that @xmath241 indeed has the interpretation of the volume of a labelled triangulation .",
    "note that the volume turns out to be purely imaginary .",
    "this has to do with the fact that in ( [ zbfl3d ] ) one sums over configurations of @xmath4 of both positive and negative volume . a more detailed explanation of this is given in @xcite .",
    "the volume ( [ vol-1 ] ) has three types of contributions : ( i ) from vertices ; ( ii ) from edges ; ( iii ) from tetrahedra .",
    "it is not hard to calculate the first two types of them .",
    "one finds that each vertex contributes exactly @xmath247 , and each edge contributes @xmath248 , where @xmath191 is the spin that labels the edge @xmath190 .",
    "it is much more complicated to find the tetrahedron contribution to the volume , that is , the derivative of @xmath249 with respect to @xmath179 . the result is described in the appendix d. using the notations of the appendix d , the final result for the expectation value of the spacetime volume in bf theory can be written as follows :    @xmath250 @xmath251 here @xmath252 stands for the normalized classical @xmath194-symbol .",
    "it is interesting to note that not only tetrahedra @xmath141 of @xmath31 contribute to the volume , but also the edges @xmath190 and vertices @xmath244 .",
    "the contribution from the vertices is somewhat trivial ",
    "it is constant for each vertex .",
    "nevertheless , when thinking about the triangulated manifold @xmath8 one is forced to assign the spacetime volume to every vertex .",
    "the contribution from edges depends on the spins labelling the edges .",
    "again , this implies that each edge of the triangulation @xmath31 carries an intrinsic volume that depends on its spin .",
    "the contribution from tetrahedra is more complicated .",
    "it is given by a function that depends on the spins labelling the edges of each tetrahedron .",
    "it is interesting that this picture of the spacetime volume being split into contributions from vertices , edges and tetrahedra can be understood in terms of heegard splitting of @xmath8 .",
    "recall that heegard splitting of a three - dimensional manifold @xmath8 decomposes @xmath8 into three dimensional manifolds with boundaries .",
    "then the original manifold can be obtained by gluing these manifolds along the boundaries . for the case of a triangulated manifold @xmath8 , as we have now , the heegard splitting proceeds as follows .",
    "first , one constructs balls centered at the vertices of @xmath31 .",
    "then one connects these balls with cylinders , whose axes of cylindrical symmetry coincide with the edges of @xmath31 . removing from @xmath8 the obtained balls and cylinders , one obtains a three - dimensional manifold with a complicated boundary .",
    "one has to further cut this manifold along the faces of @xmath31 .",
    "one obtains three types of `` building blocks '' that are needed to reconstruct the original manifold : ( i ) balls ; ( ii ) cylinders ; ( iii ) spheres with four discs removed .",
    "each of this manifolds carries a part of the original volume of @xmath8 .",
    "our result ( [ vol-2 ] ) provides one with exactly the same picture : the volume of @xmath8 is concentrated in vertices ( balls of the heegard splitting ) , edges ( cylinders ) , and tetrahedra ( 4-holed spheres ) .",
    "crane , kauffman and yetter @xcite studied a state sum model that is very similar to the ooguri model @xcite , however , instead of the gauge group @xmath71 the quantum group @xmath213 is used .",
    "the state sum invariant they proposed is given by ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath253 here @xmath220 is the quantum dimension ( [ qdim ] ) , @xmath219 is defined by ( [ eta ] ) , @xmath254 stands for a ( normalized ) quantum ( 15j)-symbol ( see the appendix [ appha ] ) associate with any 4-simplex .",
    "this quantum ( 15j)-symbol is the reshetikhin turaev evaluation of the graph @xmath149 described in subsection ( [ sec:4d ] ) . the symbols @xmath221 and @xmath4 stand for the number of vertices and edges in @xmath31 correspondingly .",
    "this state sum model is independent of a triangulation of the 4-manifold used to compute ( [ cy ] ) .",
    "thus , it gives an invariant associated with the manifold @xmath32 : @xmath255 .",
    "the quantity @xmath256 is conjectured to give the transition amplitude for @xmath257 theory with cosmological constant , the cosmological constant @xmath258 being related to @xmath214 by @xmath259 thus , unlike in the case of 3-dimensions , we have now @xmath260 .",
    "this relation can be established as follows .",
    "it has been shown ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) that if @xmath32 is a manifold with boundary then @xmath261 is proportional to the chern - simons transition amplitude @xmath262 introduced in the previous subsection : @xmath263 the deformation parameter @xmath214 of the crane - yetter model is related to the level of chern - simons theory as in ( [ q ] ) .",
    "consider now the transition amplitude for @xmath257 theory with cosmological term : @xmath264 let us integrate over the field @xmath4 in this path integral .",
    "one gets @xmath265 now , using the fact that @xmath266 we get @xmath267 this , together with ( [ d1 ] ) , then implies that @xmath268 where @xmath214 is related to @xmath179 as in ( [ q - lambda ] ) .    to compare the spin foam model we obtain below with the crane - yetter model we will need to know the first order term in the decomposition of @xmath269 in the power series in @xmath179 . to find it",
    ", we have to take into account the fact that , similarly to the case of 3d bf theory , the transition amplitude is only proportional to the crane - yetter amplitude ( [ cy ] ) , with the proportionality coefficient being a function of @xmath216 .",
    "this proportionality coefficient is given by a power of @xmath216 .",
    "as one can check , the `` zeroth '' order term in @xmath216 of ( [ cy ] ) is equal to @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the ooguri state sum invariant ( [ o ] ) .",
    "thus , the first order term in @xmath179 of @xmath269 is given by @xmath272 however , unlike the case of 3d bf theory with cosmological term , in this case the only contribution to this expression comes from the quantum ( 15j)-symbol .",
    "all other `` building blocks '' that one encounters in ( [ cy ] ) contain only the @xmath273 terms , and , thus , do not contribute to ( [ cy1 ] ) .",
    "the first derivative of the quantum ( 15j)-symbol with respect to @xmath274 can be found by methods analogous to the ones used in the appendix d to calculate the derivative of ( 6j)-symbol .",
    "however , in the case of ( 15j)-symbol , the calculation is much simpler due to the fact that only crossings contribute to the first order in @xmath216 .",
    "the ( 15j)-symbol used in ( [ cy ] ) contains only one crossing ( see , for example , @xcite ) . using the expression ( [ r - matrix ] ) for the r - matrix as a formal power series in @xmath216 given in the appendix d",
    ", one can easily check that the first @xmath216-order term of the quantum ( 15j)-symbol is given by : @xmath275 where the dots stands for terms containing graspings between two edges sharing one vertex and correspond to different possible choices of the framing of the 15j - symbol .",
    "we will not keep track of these terms at this stage .",
    "their relevance will be discussed below .",
    "this is , however , not quite the expression we want because it is not symmetrical .",
    "we will symmetrize it by putting the grasping at all pairs of lines of the graph in ( [ cy3 ] ) that do not share a vertex .",
    "however , if one does that , than the quantity one obtains for each given 4-simplex @xmath98 is not equal to ( [ cy3 ] ) .",
    "only if one sums over all 4-simplices of the triangulation one obtains the quantity that is equal to the sum of ( [ cy3 ] ) over @xmath98 .",
    "this can be proved by using certain simple relations that hold for graspings .",
    "one such relation is the analogs of `` closure '' relations ( [ closure ] ) .",
    "it graphical representation is given by : @xmath276 such `` closure '' relation holds for every vertex of the graph in ( [ cy3 ] ) .",
    "another relation that one has to use involves two different pentagon graphs .",
    "as one can convince oneself , the vertices of the pentagon graph in ( [ cy3 ] ) are in one - to - one correspondence with the tetrahedra of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , every tetrahedron is shared exactly by two 4-simplices , and the following relations holds : @xmath277 this allows one to cancel certain types of graspings from one 4-simplex with similar types of graspings from the neighboring 4-simplex .",
    "certain cancellations occur for each tetrahedron of the triangulation .",
    "these relations allow one to obtain the following symmetric expression : @xmath278 where the sum is taken over different pairs @xmath279 of edges that do not share a vertex .",
    "there are 30 terms in this sum , which explains the factor of @xmath280 in ( [ cy2 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath281 in ( [ cy2 ] ) is plus or minus one depending on the orientation of the two edges @xmath279",
    ". a consistent choice of orientations comes from the geometrical 4-simplex discussed in the appendix e. with this choice , @xmath282 , where we use the fact that every edge of the pentagon graph in ( [ cy2 ] ) is in one - to - one correspondence with a face of the corresponding 4-simplex , and @xmath283 is defined by the equation ( [ bi - volume1 ] ) .",

    "in this section we use the generating functional computed in sec.[sec : gf ] to construct systematically state sum models of the theories described in sec.[sec : th ] .",
    "we then compare the results of this systematic approach with the known results described in sec.[sec : sf ] .",
    "the transition amplitude of the theory is simply the value of the generating function @xmath24 at @xmath127 .",

    "however , the later is what is called a `` standard renormalization '' of the partition function .",

    "see , for instance , @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the standard renormalizations .",
    "thus , the partition function obtained by our method differs from that of the migdal - witten model just by a standard renormalization factor .",
    "as one can see from ( [ bf3daction ] ) , the ` interaction ' term @xmath319 for this theory is given by @xmath320 as in the case of yang - mills theory in two dimensions , one has to find a polynomial function @xmath302 of variables @xmath36 by evaluating ( [ bfl1 ] ) on the distributional field @xmath4 given by ( [ distr ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of three dimensions the result is not well - defined as in the case of 2d yang - mills theory .",

    "the importance of other types of intersections , not treated here , will be emphasized later .",

    "there are 20 ( without counting the permutations ) different triples of wedges @xmath324 .",
    "four of these triples do not span a three - volume ; thus , it is natural at first to take the integral ( [ inters ] ) for such triples to be zero .",
    "these are exactly the triples of wedges that share a line  a part of the dual edge .",
    "thus , there are only 16 different triples of wedges ( without counting the permutations ) that contribute to ( [ inters ] ) for a given tetrahedron .",

    "thus , for any given triple of wedges @xmath324 , the integral ( [ inters ] ) is proportional to @xmath325 but the proportionality coefficients are not fixed , because of the indeterminacy in the value of the integral @xmath326 of course if the wedges were infinite planes without boundaries this integral is a well - defined quantity : it is just the intersection number and as such should be @xmath327 depending on the orientations of the wedges . because of the existence of boundary we expect this integral to be a number smaller than @xmath328 .",
    "we fix the proportionality coefficient by requiring that @xmath329 where the integral is taken over a tetrahedron @xmath141 , is equal to the geometrical volume of @xmath141 . for any triple of wedges @xmath324 , the integral ( [ bfl3 ] ) is equal to @xmath330 , where @xmath318 is a coefficient that is independent on a triple , and @xmath331 is plus or minus one depending on the orientation of the form @xmath332 .",
    "thus , ( [ bfl4 ] ) is equal to @xmath333 here the sum is taken over triples of different wedges in @xmath141 , taking into account all different permutations of @xmath322 . taking into account the fact that the number of permutations of @xmath322 is 6",
    ", we get for ( [ bfl4 ] ) : @xmath334 where the notation @xmath335 means that the sum is taken over 16 different triples @xmath324 such that @xmath336 .    to relate ( [ bfl5 ] ) to the volume of tetrahedron @xmath141 , we recall the geometrical interpretation of variables @xmath36 .",
    "they were introduced in the previous section as the variables that carry information about the length of edges of the triangulation . at this stage",
    "it is more convenient to introduce @xmath308 indices ( [ components ] ) .",
    "thus , each @xmath36 is characterized by @xmath337 .",
    "recall that wedges @xmath37 are in one - to - one correspondence with edges @xmath190 of the triangulation .",
    "thus , let us view each @xmath338 as the vector representing the corresponding edge ( each edge can be viewed as a vector pointing from one vertex of @xmath31 to another ) , and the norm squared @xmath339 of @xmath338 as the length squared of this vector .",
    "indeed , it is not hard to check that the interpretation of @xmath339 as the length of the corresponding edge is consistent with the other known facts",
    ". let us consider the operator corresponding to @xmath339 . according to our general prescription ,",
    "this quantity is represented by the operator @xmath340 .",
    "we have already dealt with this operator in the previous subsection , see ( [ ymq3 ] ) .",
    "its eigenvalue is given just by the half of the casimir ( plus @xmath341 ) .",
    "thus , in the sense of eigenvalues , we can write @xmath342 where @xmath84 is the spin from ( [ z3 ] ) labelling the dual face that contains @xmath37 . thus , ( [ bfl6 ] ) tells us that , in the limit of large spins @xmath84 , the norm of @xmath36 grows as @xmath84 .",
    "this is to be compared with the length spectrum of the canonical quantum theory @xmath343 this also grows as @xmath84 for large spins .",
    "the expression ( [ lengthspec ] ) can be easily derived in the context of canonical ( loop ) quantum gravity in three dimensions ( note that we use units in which @xmath178 ) .",
    "another motivation for interpreting the spin @xmath84 as the length of an edge ( for large @xmath84 ) is that it is exactly this interpretation that must be used to reproduce correctly the regge calculus version of einstein - hilbert action in the ponzano - regge model of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "thus , we learn that the interpretation of the norm of each vector @xmath36 must be that of the length of the corresponding edge of @xmath31 . having this fixed we can relate ( [ bfl5 ] ) to the volume of tetrahedron @xmath141 .",
    "we have @xmath344 where we have introduced the @xmath308 indices , see ( [ components ] ) .",
    "each @xmath338 has the interpretation of the vector corresponding to one of the edges of @xmath141 .",
    "thus , ( [ bfl7 ] ) is equal to @xmath345 , where @xmath221 is the volume of @xmath141 . in ( [ bfl5 ] ) we have 16 such terms .",
    "thus , it is equal to @xmath346 the requirement that ( [ bfl4 ] ) is equal to the volume of @xmath141 fixes the parameter @xmath318 to be @xmath347 .",
    "thus , finally , we obtain the interaction term @xmath348 to be @xmath349 where the sum is taken over 16 terms . to obtain the transition amplitude of the theory we have to replace each @xmath338 by the operator @xmath350 and act by the exponential of ( [ bfl8 ] ) on the generating functional",
    "thus , the first order term in @xmath179 in the decomposition of the transition amplitude is given by : @xmath351 this is to be compared with ( [ vol-2 ] ) .",
    "we will now show that the most complicated term in that expression  the term that involves trivalent graspings  exactly matches our result ( [ bfl9 ] ) , including the numerical coefficient and the sign . to see this we just have to relate the trivalent grasping in ( [ vol-2 ] ) to the cubic operator in ( [ bfl9 ] ) .",
    "as explained in the appendix d , a single grasping in ( [ vol-2 ] ) acts by inserting @xmath352 , where @xmath353 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the operator @xmath354 , when applied only one time , acts by inserting just @xmath353 . also , taking into account the definition of the trivalent grasping in ( [ vol-2 ] )",
    ", one can show that @xmath355 so our approach _ does _ account for the most intricate part of the 3d transition amplitude in the first @xmath179-order , reproducing correctly even the numerical coefficients .",
    "note , however , that we do not get all of the terms appearing in ( [ vol-2 ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy we find between the model we obtain and the usual state sum model can be understood by comparing the two different expressions for the spacetime volume : the one obtained within our approach and the one obtained within the turaev - viro model , see ( [ vol-2 ] ) .",
    "the turaev - viro model tells us that we must associate the spacetime volume not only to tetrahedra of the triangulation , but also to edges and vertices . within our approach ,",
    "only the tetrahedron part of the spacetime volume is accounted for .",
    "the reason for this was that , when evaluating the cosmological term of the action on the distributional @xmath4 field , we took only the terms which came from intersections of different wedges at the centers of tetrahedra .",
    "as we discussed , even these terms are ill - defined because of the distributional nature of the @xmath4 field .",
    "however , the corresponding ambiguities can be successfully resolved for these types of intersections by using geometrical considerations , and , after the ambiguities are eliminated , the result exactly matches the analogous terms of the usual state sum models , including the matching of the numerical factors .",
    "the geometrical considerations we used were exactly the ones that relate the terms we considered to the volume of a geometrical 3-simplex .",
    "thus , it is not very surprising that only the `` part '' of the turaev - viro model that accounts for the volume of 3-simplices was reproduced correctly : as the geometrical considerations we used above tell us , we considered only the terms that are relevant for the volume of individual 3-simplices .",
    "however , there are other types of terms that we did not consider and that may be crucial to reproduce the corresponding state sum model correctly .",
    "let us consider , for example , the terms of the type : @xmath356 for some @xmath357 .",
    "the result of such an integral is ill - defined .",
    "indeed , there is an indeterminacy of the type @xmath358 , where @xmath359 comes from @xmath360 ( see ( [ distr-2 ] ) ) , and @xmath361 comes from the square of the @xmath76-function @xmath362 .",
    "these terms are proportional to @xmath363    other terms that may arise are @xmath364 for some @xmath37 .",
    "they arise as the result of the indeterminacy @xmath365 , where @xmath366 comes from @xmath367 ( see ( [ distr-2 ] ) ) , and @xmath368 comes from the cube of the @xmath76-function @xmath369 .",
    "these terms are proportional to @xmath370 there is no obvious reason to set these two types of terms to zero .",
    "in fact , as one can see , these are exactly the types of terms that are needed to account for the other terms appearing in the first @xmath179-order in the turaev - viro model .",
    "although the structure of terms appearing this way is clear , at the present state of the development of our approach , no geometrical arguments is available to fix the ambiguity in the coefficients in front of such terms .",
    "however , the precise agreement of the terms for which such arguments do exist gives hope that , ones the above ambiguities are resolved , we will have an exact agreement between the models obtained using our procedure and the usual state sum models .      in the case of 4d bf theory with cosmological term the interaction @xmath304",
    "is given by : @xmath371 our general prescription is to evaluate this interaction term on the distribution ( [ distr-1 ] ) and find a polynomial function @xmath302 .",
    "thus , one has to evaluate integrals @xmath372 with @xmath38 given by ( [ distr:4d ] ) .",
    "the integral ( [ bf4 - 1 ] ) is non - zero only if wedges @xmath291 intersect .",
    "however , similarly to the case of 3d , the result when the wedges intersect is ill - defined because of the distributional nature of @xmath38 .",
    "thus , again some independent considerations have to be used to fix the ambiguity .",
    "we use a strategy similar to the one adopted in the case of 3d bf theory .",
    "we consider only the terms coming from wedges @xmath291 intersecting at the center of a 4-simplex .",
    "as we shall see , these are the most important terms in the sense that they are responsible for the main terms in the first order in @xmath179 of the crane - yetter model .",
    "the relevance of other types of terms will be emphasized below . to fix the ambiguity in ( [ bf4 - 1 ] ) when @xmath291 are two wedges that intersect at the center of a 4-simplex @xmath98 we use geometrical considerations .",
    "let us consider the integral @xmath373 over the interior of a particular 4-simplex @xmath98 .",
    "it is equal to the sum @xmath374 each of the integrals here is proportional to @xmath375 with the proportionality coefficient given by : @xmath376 the later is equal to @xmath377 , where @xmath318 is a numerical parameter , whose value is not fixed due to the ambiguity referred to above , and @xmath378 is the sign of the volume form in ( [ bf4 - 3 ] ) .",
    "thus , ( [ bf4 - 2 ] ) is equal to @xmath379 where the sum is taken over wedges @xmath291 inside @xmath98 that span a 4-volume .",
    "there are exactly 30 terms summed over in ( [ bf4 - 4 ] ) .",
    "we will fix the parameter @xmath318 relating the quantities @xmath338 to the geometrical 4-simplex in @xmath380 .",
    "first , let us note that when @xmath4 in ( [ bf4 - 2 ] ) is equal to the self - dual part of the wedge product of two copies of the frame field : @xmath381},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath382 is a frame ( tetrad ) field , then ( [ bf4 - 2 ] ) is equal to @xmath383 where @xmath384 is the volume of @xmath98 with respect to the metric defined by @xmath382 .",
    "thus , we will fix @xmath318 in such a way that ( [ bf4 - 4 ] ) is equal to @xmath385 when @xmath386 can be related to the quantities characterizing a geometrical 4-simplex .",
    "recall that a geometrical 4-simplex in @xmath380 is characterized ( up to translations ) by four vectors : the four vectors pointing from one of the vertices to the other four ( for more details see the appendix e ) . for each face of @xmath98",
    "one can also construct the so - called bivectors , which are given by the wedge products of any two of the edges belonging to that face .",
    "the bivectors live in the second exterior power of @xmath380 .",
    "one can take the self - dual part of a bivector to obtain an element of @xmath387 . as is shown in the appendix e ( see ( [ biselfarea ] ) ) , the norm ( obtained using the usual flat metric in @xmath387 ) of the self - dual part of each bivector is equal to the squared area of the corresponding face .",
    "there exists also a simple expression ( [ sd4volume ] ) for the volume of a 4-simplex involving only the self - dual parts of bivectors .",
    "recall now that wedges @xmath388 are in one - to - one correspondence with faces of @xmath98 . then , if @xmath338 has the interpretation of the self - dual part of the bivector corresponding to a face of @xmath98 .",
    "a comparison of ( [ sd4volume ] ) , ( [ bf4.2 ] ) fixes the value of @xmath318 to be @xmath389 .",
    "thus , the first @xmath179-order term of the transition amplitude is given by : @xmath390 to compare this with ( [ cy2 ] ) we need the relation between the grasping there and the operator in ( [ bf4 - 5 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding relation is given by @xmath391 using this correspondence we see that ( [ bf4 - 5 ] ) agree with the result ( [ cy2 ] ) . as in the 3d case ,",
    "the matching includes the numerical coefficient and the sign of the expressions .",
    "let us now discuss the role of the terms denoted by dots in ( [ cy2 ] ) .",
    "let us recall that those terms are determined by a framing of the ( 15j)-symbol used in the crane - yetter model .",
    "these terms are given by a sum of graspings of edges of the graph @xmath149 that share a vertex .",
    "recall that vertices of @xmath149 are in one - to - one correspondence with the tetrahedra of h. thus , the general structure of these terms is such that they can be grouped according to a 3-simplex ( tetrahedron ) to which they `` belong '' .",
    "therefore , these terms can be thought of as the contribution to the 4-volume of the bf theory coming from individual tetrahedra of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , these terms are in certain sense analogous to the terms in 3d that carry 3-volume corresponding to the edges of @xmath31 . as in 3d",
    "our approach did not reproduce correctly the terms corresponding to edges , in 4d we did not reproduce correctly the contribution to the 4-volume coming from tetrahedra .",
    "similarly to the case of 3d , these terms may possibly be reproduced if one takes into account the types of intersections in ( [ bf4 - 1 ] ) other than the ones considered here .      in order to apply our strategy to the self - dual plebanski model",
    "let us consider the `` interaction '' term of the action ( [ sdgraction ] ) : @xmath392 using the same procedure as in the case of the 4-dimensional bf theory with cosmological constant , this term , when evaluated on distributional @xmath4 field , gives @xmath393 where @xmath394 denotes the center of the 4-simplex and @xmath395 is a quadratic function in the wedge variables @xmath36 .",
    "in order to write ( [ sdgr-2 ] ) we have absorbed some unimportant numerical constants into the lagrange multipliers @xmath188 .",
    "the generating functional approach tells us that the spin foam transition amplitude of the self dual plebanski model is given by @xmath396 where @xmath397 the integration over @xmath183 gives rise to delta functions .",
    "thus , @xmath398 can be characterized as the solution of @xmath399 for all 4-simplices @xmath98 , or , equivalently , as the solution of @xmath400 using the fact that @xmath401 and , therefore , @xmath398 are gauge invariant and the property that an @xmath402 symmetric traceless tensor @xmath287 is totally characterized up to gauge transformation by its square @xmath403 we see that the preceding equation is equivalent to @xmath404 the solution of the later can be written as @xmath405    in this form the result is very similar to the one given by the reisenberger model .",
    "there are however several differences .",
    "the first one is the fact that the derivative operators appearing in our result are the commutative ones , while reisenberger uses the non - commutative right and left invariant vector fields .",
    "the second difference is due to the presence of the factors of @xmath406 in the generating functional . in the next section",
    "we will emphasize significance of these discrepancies .",
    "in this section we summarize what has been achieved , discuss open questions of the approach and give some speculations as to possible directions of future research .",
    "as we have said in the introduction , our main aim was to understand whether the known spin foam ( state sum ) models , in particular the ones discussed in section [ sec : sf ] , could be obtained as a result of some systematic procedure that starts from the corresponding classical action principle .",
    "we have proposed such a procedure , motivated by certain results of the loop approach to quantum gravity .",
    "our main idea is two - fold .",
    "first , we proposed to include in the path integral certain distributional field configurations .",
    "in fact , in this paper we concentrated only on such distributional configurations .",
    "the distributional field was taken to be the @xmath4 field . as we discussed above , this is motivated by the distributional nature of the non - abelian `` electric '' field of the canonical approach .",
    "we put the distributional @xmath4 field on a collection of two - dimensional polygons in spacetime , for which we used the collection of dual cells ( faces ) of a fixed triangulation of the spacetime manifold .",
    "second , to calculate the path integral , we have employed the idea of the generating functional .",
    "this allows one to discuss different theories from the same point of view .",
    "as we have seen , the generating functional is the same for any theory in a given spacetime dimension , and transition amplitudes for different theories arise as different formal power series in the derivatives with respect to the current .",
    "thus , this is quite reminiscent of the standard quantum field theory in minkowski spacetime picture , where many different theories can arise from the same free theory as sums over different types of feynman diagrams .",
    "as we have seen , the role of the free theory is played in our approach by bf theory .",
    "below we shall speculate more on the analogy between the diagrammatic expressions arising in our approach and feynman diagrams .",
    "we have seen that our approach reproduces correctly the transition amplitudes for bf theory in any dimension and the partition function for yang - mills theory in two dimensions .",
    "we have also compared the transition amplitudes for bf theories with cosmological term that arise in our approach with the ones given by the corresponding states sum models .",
    "we did this by comparing the first order terms in the decomposition of the corresponding amplitudes in the power series in @xmath179 . in the case of 4d theory",
    ", we found agreement ( apart from the terms that have to do with the framing ) , and in the 3d case only a partial agreement was reached .",
    "note , however , that our approach _ does _ account for the most intricate part of the 3d and 4d transition amplitudes in the first @xmath179-order , reproducing correctly even the numerical coefficients .",
    "we have also seen , both in the cases of 3d and 4d , that the missing contributions can be interpreted as coming from singular contributions arising when one regularizes the volume operator .",
    "we expect that some new ideas will be necessary to resolve these regularization ambiguities . presumably , a study of the higher order terms in @xmath179 may give some clues as to how these ambiguities must be resolved .",
    "let us conclude with some speculations and directions for future research .",
    "an interesting open question that arises within our approach is as follows .",
    "we have seen that the state sum formulation of the topological bf theory can be obtained by using distributional fields associated with a 2-dimensional cellular complex .",
    "moreover , the residual regularized action on the 2-dimensional worldsheet is given by 2d bf - yang - mills theory .",
    "it is important to understand why such result is valid .",
    "one possibility would be to use the degenerate solutions found by baez @xcite as some monopole contributions playing a major role in defining the measure of the field theory",
    ". it might be that the topological nature of the theory depends on whether these singular solutions dominate or not the partition function .    in this paper",
    "we have discussed only correlation functions in the @xmath4 fields .",
    "it is also possible to use our approach to compute the expectation value of the wilson loop functionals .",
    "we hope to perform such calculations in the future .",
    "let us now comment on the analogy between the diagrammatic expressions we have found and feynman diagrams . in our approach the role of the `` free '' theory is played by the bf theory .",
    "thus , the free transition amplitudes in our case are just the bf transition amplitudes , given by certain sums of products of functions of spins labelling the triangulation .",
    "this is to be compared with the feynman diagram technique free amplitudes which are just lines representing the free propagation of quanta .",
    "it is important that the bf amplitudes are independent of the triangulation used to compute them .",
    "they depend only on the properties of the initial and final states ( and , of course , on the topology of the manifold that is contained between the initial and final hypersurfaces ) .",
    "the more complicated , `` interacting '' amplitudes are given in our approach by inserting various chord diagrams into spin networks , with spin networks representing the free amplitudes .",
    "this is to be compared with how one takes into account interactions in the standard qft s : graphically this is also represented by inserting certain types of vertices into the free diagrams . in our case , each grasping occurs within a particular simplex of the triangulation .",
    "one then has to take a sum over simplices .",
    "similarly , in qft s ( in the coordinate representation ) one puts an interaction vertex at a particular point and then integrates over the position of this point .",
    "thus , it is tempting to draw an analogy between a simplex of a triangulation in our case and a point in qft s . to summarize , spin networks play in our theory the role of the diagrams of free propagation , and the graspings by the chord diagrams are analogous to the insertion of interaction vertices into the diagrams of qft s .",
    "finally , let us discuss implications of the results we have obtained for the known spin foam models of quantum gravity in 4d .",
    "the most popular of these are the reisenberger model @xcite , discussed in some details above , and the barrett - crane model @xcite .",
    "the major problem with both of them is that they are rather invented then derived as a result of some systematic procedure starting from the einstein - hilbert action or any equivalent of it .",
    "however , as we have seen on the example of the reisenberger model , and as one can check for the case of barrett - crane model , our approach to some extent reproduces the transition amplitudes given by these models .",
    "for example , our approach gives a clear interpretation of the so far mysterious evaluation of the spin networks that satisfy the constraint equations on the flat connection that is performed to obtain the amplitude . in our approach",
    "this evaluation has an obvious meaning of taking @xmath127 at the end of the calculation of a transition amplitude .",
    "we have also seen that the constraint equations of the known spin foam models have the meaning of differential equations that must be satisfied by the generating functional . however , although the main features of the both models were reproduced by our approach , some important details are different in the models we have obtained .",
    "thus , our approach prescribes to use the commuting variational derivatives with respect to the current instead of non - commuting vector fields used by reisenberger @xcite .",
    "also , the presence of the function @xmath406 , which plays a crucial role in , for example , 2d yang - mills theory , is not accounted for by the reisenberger and barrett - crane models .",
    "one more important lesson that one can learn from our results is as follows . on examples of 3d and 4d bf theories with cosmological term",
    "we have seen that the simplest regularization of the `` interaction '' ( volume ) term of the action that we have discussed above _ does not _",
    "account for all terms one gets from the corresponding `` exact '' models .",
    "however , the reisenberger model , for example , uses exactly the same way of regularizing the constraints of the theory , for , using the terminology of our approach , it takes into account only the simplest types of intersections of wedges when regularizing the constraint part of the action .",
    "our experience with the bf theories tells us that this can not be correct .",
    "thus , it could be that the problems with the reisenberger model ( for example , no interesting solutions of his constraint equations is known ) arise simply because this model does not take into a proper account other terms that arise in the regularization of the constraints .",
    "similar is true for the barrett - crane model .",
    "the original motivation for our research program was to find a systematic procedure that gives one a way to derive spin foam models of various theories starting from the corresponding action functionals .",
    "however , the procedure proposed in this paper is still far from being able to claim to have achieved this goal . yet , by studying the procedure proposed , we have learned a lot about existing models and obtained an important insight as to their deep internal structure .",
    "our results also led us to the conclusion that the existing models of quantum gravity in 4d are too oversimplified . in spite of these rather negative conclusions",
    ", we believe that some of the insights we have obtained in this paper will become a part of the final , possibly much more elaborate picture .",

    "normalized in a special way . but",
    "first , let us define the so - called _",
    "spin networks_.    an @xmath71 spin network functional is defined by the following data : ( i ) an oriented graph @xmath44 ; ( ii ) a map @xmath459 from the set of edges of @xmath44 to the set of irreducible representations of @xmath71 ; ( iii ) a map",
    "@xmath460 from the set of vertices @xmath221 to the set of intertwiners , which assigns to each vertex @xmath244 an intertwiner from the tensor product of representations labelling the incoming edges to the tensor product of representations labelling the outgoing edges .",

    "we will use the normalized trivalent vertex , defined in such a way that the @xmath462-symbol constructed from 3 spins is always equal to unity : @xmath463 where the operation @xmath464 denotes the evaluation of the corresponding spin network on all group elements equal to the unity in the group .    with this normalization of the trivalent vertex intertwiner",
    ", one can show that the following relation holds : @xmath465 using this relation one can find the result of the integral of a product of 3 and 4 group elements .",
    "the corresponding formulas are : @xmath466    also , we use the same trivalent vertex to define the normalized ( 6j),(15j)-symbols used in the body of the paper .",
    "both symbols are given by evaluations of the corresponding spin networks , where the intertwiner used in a trivalent vertex is always the one normalized as in ( [ theta - norm ] ) .",
    "thus , we get : @xmath467 where the resolution of the 4-valent vertex in ( [ 15j - def ] ) is given by : @xmath468",

    "we are not going into the details of this construction .",
    "however we must say that this construction uses three main building blocks : the braiding @xmath487 , the associator @xmath488 , which should satisfy the pentagon and hexagon identity , and the value of the un - knot @xmath489 , where @xmath490 denotes the unit interval ( [ expan ] ) @xcite .",
    "one important property of the universal invariant is that @xmath492 is equal to the reshetikhin - turaev evaluation of the link @xmath483 associated with the quantum group @xmath493 @xcite , where @xmath494 and the casimir is normalized such that the norm of long roots is @xmath495 .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite , that the universal invariant @xmath24 can be extended to an invariant of oriented , framed trivalent graphs embedded into @xmath484 .",

    "the next term , proportional to @xmath501 , is given by  : @xmath502 here we have used the fact that , in the case of @xmath402 and for the normalization of the casimir given by the trace in the fundamental representation , the identity @xmath503 is satisfied . this term can be written in a symmetric form as : @xmath504 where the first sum is over all triples of distinct edges of the tetrahedra and the second sum is over all edges of the tetrahedra .",
    "in this appendix we list some facts about the geometry of a 4-simplex in @xmath380 .",
    "the geometrical considerations used in ( [ sec : bf4d ] ) are based on some of these facts .",
    "a 4-simplex in @xmath380 is characterized ( up to translations ) by four vectors .",
    "these , for instance , can be vectors pointing from one of the vertices , which we will denote by ( 0 ) , to the other four vertices ( 1)-(4 ) .",
    "let us denote these vectors by @xmath505 . here",
    "@xmath506 is an index for a vector in @xmath380 , and @xmath507 indicates a vertex at which the vector is directed .",
    "thus , @xmath508 is a vector pointing from vertex ( 0 ) to the vertex ( 1 ) .    instead of vectors",
    "it is sometimes more convenient to use the so - called bivectors .",
    "a bivector @xmath509 is an element of the second exterior power of @xmath380 . in particular , it can be obtained by wedging two vectors .",
    "thus , bivectors that characterize a 4-simplex are obtained as @xmath510}_b$ ] . here",
    "the brackets denote the operation of antisymmetrization .",
    "it is not hard to see that bivectors @xmath511 are in one - to - one correspondence with faces of the 4-simplex @xmath98 .",
    "for example , the bivector @xmath512 corresponds to the face whose vertices are ( 0),(1),(2 ) .",
    "the norm of each bivector is proportional to the squared area of the corresponding face @xmath513 where @xmath514 is the area of the face ( 0),(a),(b ) and no summation over @xmath174 is assumed .",
    "the volume of @xmath98 can be obtained by wedging two bivectors that correspond to faces that do not share an edge .",
    "for example , with our choice of orientation of @xmath8 , the volume is given by @xmath515    it is sometimes convenient to introduce bivectors corresponding to all 10 faces of @xmath98 .",
    "so far we have introduced 6 bivectors @xmath511 corresponding to 6 faces of @xmath98 .",
    "bivectors that correspond to other 4 faces can be obtained as linear combinations of these 6 bivectors .",
    "when working with all 10 bivectors , it is convenient to label bivectors by 3 different indices instead of just two",
    ". we will employ for this purpose small greek letters .",
    "thus , bivectors are denoted by @xmath516 .",
    "these bivectors are defined by @xmath517}_{\\alpha\\gamma},\\ ] ] where @xmath518 is a vector that points from the vertex @xmath318 to vertex @xmath519 .",
    "the norm of all bivectors ( [ bi ] ) is equal to the twice of the squared area of the corresponding face , as in ( [ bi - area ] ) .",
    "as we have said above , only 6 of 10 bivectors ( [ bi ] ) are independent .",
    "thus , there are certain relations between them .",
    "one can write one such relation for each tetrahedron of @xmath98 .",
    "one gets 5 relations only 4 of which are independent . with our definition ( [ bi ] )",
    "these relations are @xmath520 where we have suppressed the indices @xmath521 for brevity .",
    "the volume of @xmath98 can be expressed as a wedge product of any two of the bivectors ( [ bi ] ) corresponding to faces that do not share an edge .",
    "this can be written as @xmath522 where we have introduced a notation @xmath523 for a bivector that corresponds to face @xmath122 , and @xmath283 is the sign of the right - hand - side in ( [ bi - volume1 ] ) .",
    "the expression ( [ bi - volume1 ] ) gives the volume of @xmath98 for any two pairs of faces @xmath524 that do not share an edge .",
    "one can use the expression ( [ bi - volume ] ) and the `` closure '' relations ( [ closure ] ) to work out the correct sign of any of such formula for the volume .",
    "any bivector can naturally be split in its self - dual and anti - self - dual parts : @xmath525 the self - dual and anti - self - dual parts are given correspondingly by @xmath526 where the hodge star duality operation is defined as @xmath527 since the space of self - dual ( and anti - self - dual ) bivectors in @xmath380 is three - dimensional , we can introduce a new set of indices to label them .",
    "thus , as the index for self - dual ( anti - self - dual ) bivector we will use lower case latin letters from the middle of the alphabet : @xmath528 .",
    "the norm of any self - dual ( anti - self - dual ) bivector calculated by contracting indices @xmath521 will be the same as the norm calculated by contracting the single index @xmath171 : @xmath529 where we have suppressed the indices @xmath530 .    not any bivector in @xmath380 is simple , that is , not any bivector is a wedge product of two vectors .",
    "the necessary and sufficient requirement of simplicity is that the norm of the self - dual part is equal to the norm of the anti - self - dual part of the bivector .",
    "thus , using ( [ bi - area ] ) , we can conclude that when a bivector is simple , its self - dual part norm is equal to the squared area of the corresponding face .",
    "@xmath531 there exists an expression for the volume of @xmath98 that involves only the self - dual parts of bivectors ( [ bi ] ) : @xmath532 where @xmath533 is the self - dual part of the bivector ( [ bi ] ) corresponding to the face @xmath122 , the sum is taken over all pairs @xmath524 of faces that do not share an edge , and @xmath283 is the function introduced above by equation ( [ bi - volume1 ] ) .",
