    "quantum information@xcite and open quantum systems@xcite are subjects of particular interest in the modern physics , dealing with decoherence processes , quantum computation and communication , entanglement processes , distillation protocols , schmidt decomposition , markovian and non - markovian effects , etc .",
    "a particular interesting subject in quantum information is the process of purification@xcite which consists for a mixed state @xmath0 of the hilbert space @xmath1 to find a pure state @xmath2 in an enlarged hilbert space such that @xmath3 .",
    "the auxiliary hilbert space @xmath4 can be viewed as describing an effective environment . in this paper",
    ", we want to study the purification process with respect to the dynamics of mixed states .",
    "when the dynamics is conservative , i.e. when it is described by a liouville - von neumann equation @xmath5 $ ] ( no relaxation effect occurs ) , the dynamics of the purification and the related mathematical structures have been extensively studied , see for example ref.@xcite .",
    "we study in this paper the case where the environment of the quantum system induces relaxation effects , with a the dynamics obeying to a lindblad equation@xcite .",
    "we will show that the purified state obeys in the enlarged hilbert space to a nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the emergence of a nonlinearity is not a new phenomenon in the relation between dynamics of mixed and pure states . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the pure dynamics closest to the lindblad dynamics ( in the sense that this pure dynamics is viewed as the dynamics of some tangent vectors on the density matrix manifold ) is nonlinear ; and in ref .",
    "@xcite , a purification protocol needed a nonlinear operation has been proposed ( a purification protocol is a set of operations and measurements transforming a mixed state @xmath0 to a pure state @xmath6 of the same hilbert space without the trace operation  in fact the state @xmath6 depends only on the protocol and is independent from the initial mixed state @xmath0  , it is a question different from the purification process discussed in the present paper ) .",
    "moreover the liouville equation for a piecewise deterministic process is associated for its deterministic part with a nonlinear schrdinger equation but which does not take into account the jump part ( see ref.@xcite chapter 6.1 ) in contrast with our equation for the purified dynamics .",
    "+ geometrization of physical theories is a great active area in theoretical physics . in nonrelativistic quantum dynamics , it is in particular related to the theory of geometric phases ( so - called berry phases ) @xcite . as shown by simon@xcite ,",
    "the dynamics of pure states and the berry phases take place in a geometric structure which is a principal fibre bundle endowed with a connection .",
    "some generalisations of geometric phases have been proposed for mixed states : uhlmann@xcite has proposed a concept of geometric phases based on the theory of transition propabilities for pair of mixed states , the involved geometric structures have been analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; sjqvist etal@xcite have proposed a concept of geometric phase based on an interferometric theory , the involved geometric structures have been analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; and we have proposed a concept of geometric phase in the adiabatic limit based on the generalisation of the geometric structure studied by simon from vector bundles to @xmath7-modules @xcite . by using the equation of the purified dynamics , we will built a general theory of geometric phases for open quantum systems which unifies these previous approaches .",
    "the dynamics of the density matrices present different geometric phases appearing at different levels .",
    "this is due to a more complicated gauge structure called higher gauge theory in the litterature @xcite .",
    "we will show that this struture is a generalization in the category theory of the principal bundle structure , complicated by the stratified structure of the density matrix manifold@xcite .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the geometry associated with the purification process by recalling the stratified structure of the density matrix manifold and by introducing some representations of the purified states with the associated inner products .",
    "this section introduces some mathematical tools needed to the understanding of the following .",
    "section iii shows that the purified state satisfies a nonlinear schrdinger equation if the associated mixed state satisfies a lindblad equation .",
    "a general theory of geometric phases for open quantum systems is discussed , and there relations with the different propositions of geometric phases are analysed .",
    "an example consisting to a two level system driven by an external field and submitted to dephasing and spontaneous emission effects is discussed with a numerical integration of the nonlinear schrdinger equation and numerical calculations of geometric phases .",
    "section iv studies the geometric structure involved by the general geometric phase theory and the purification process , firstly from the point of view of the ordinary differential geometry , secondly from the point of view of the category theory .",
    "it concludes by the introduction of the connective structure and the physical interpretations of the different fields involved by the connection .",
