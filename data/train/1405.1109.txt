    "quantum resources are crucial in quantum information processing @xcite . quantum entanglement , the first proposed quantum resource , has shown to be important in quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , bell test @xcite , etc .",
    "however , states without quantum entanglement but with nonzero quantum discord @xcite are also useful in some quantum information process , e.g. , deterministic quantum computation with one qubit @xcite , remote quantum state preparation @xcite , thus also being considered as quantum resource .",
    "these resources have been studied from several perspectives , such as von neumann entropy@xcite , distance@xcite , and so on@xcite .",
    "since all entangled states have nonzero discord , entangled states are considered as a subset of quantum discordant states@xcite , but whether entanglement and discord are different resources is still an open question .    in this paper , we study the quantum resources from the aspect of quantum state superposition . for a state in composite system , we define the local superposition ( ls ) as the superposition between basis of single part , and nonlocal superposition ( nls ) as the superposition between product basis of multiple parts . in this state superposition framework",
    ", quantum resources can be categorized by the superposition between different kinds of basis including different parts .",
    "we show that a state is classical when and only when it has zero local superposition and a state is separable when and only when it has zero nonlocal superposition . as for the relation of state superposition to the previously proposed quantum entanglement and quantum discord ,",
    "quantum entanglement can be considered as the quantification of nonlocal superposition but excluding the local superposition , while quantum discord includes the local superposition . however , whether quantum discord also includes nonlocal superposition is not determined in this paper .",
    "moreover , the ls and nls introduced hereinafter is generalized to multidimensional and multipartite systems . for multipartite states",
    ", we find that for pure states with schmidt decomposition , nls equals ls , while for pure states without schmidt decomposition , nls and ls might be different .",
    "this state superposition perspective might be useful in studying the multipartite entanglement . for multipartite systems ,",
    "we show explicitly the different kinds of state superpositions existing in different single part of the system , some composite parts , or all parts of the system .",
    "these plural superpositions , thus plural resources , provide us with many ways to explore the quantum feature of quantum systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in part ii",
    ", we first introduce the local superposition in two state bipartite system and then generalize it to multidimensional bipartite system . in part iii , nonlocal superposition for two partite system",
    "is introduced . in part",
    "iv , ls and nls are defined and analyzed for multipartite system . in the v part , several discussions are given . in part",
    "vi , main conclusions are presented . in the appendix , some proofs of the statements in the paper are provided .",
    "when considering a quantum state with superposition in the @xmath0 basis , @xmath1 , the coherence of the state can be defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the probability for state @xmath7 in state @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "zero coherence indicates that there is no state superposition , and thus this state has no superposition between basis @xmath0 . on the contrary , if the coherence gets the maximum value @xmath10 , there is perfect state superposition between basis @xmath0 .",
    "there are other cases between these two extreme ones .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to define the amount of superposition of @xmath11 between basis @xmath12 as @xmath13 eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) indicates that when @xmath14 , there must be state superposition between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that the value in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is dependent on the basis chosen , that is the amount of superposition defined above is basis specific .    consider a system a in a composite system ab , for example , a singlet state , @xmath17 , no matter which basis for system a is used , it is hard to say that a is in a state superposition of that basis . actually , in this case , it is impossible to assign a state description of system a. however , for this state , when the basis @xmath0 is chosen , system a will behave exactly as if it is in state @xmath18 , assuming that there is no operation on b. ( note that , this assumption is true , since if there is some operation on b , then this composite system should be described by a different state . )",
    "thus , from this point , we generalize the state superposition in system a and define the amount of superposition of this state in system a in the same way as eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . generally , for a two qubits pure state @xmath19",
    ", we define the amount of superposition of a in the @xmath20 basis ( through this paper , when basis is mentioned , it refers to orthonormal basis ) as @xmath21 where @xmath22 $ ] , which is the probability for system a in state @xmath23 . more generally , for a specific decomposition of mixed state @xmath24 ( @xmath25 )",
    ", we define the amount of superposition of a in @xmath26 basis as @xmath27 the above superposition is introduced by the basis of part a , and we define this as the local superposition with respect to part a.    _ * definition : * _ the measure of ls of @xmath28 for part a is defined as @xmath29 where the minimum is taken over all decompositions @xmath30 and all basis @xmath31 .",
    "note that the ls defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is basis independent . from the perspective of preparation",
    ", we have the choice to choose different basis . for @xmath32 ,",
    "there exists a certain decomposition and basis that no superposition presents , and thus part a can be prepared via classical operation ( we use classical operation to mean the operation that no quantum superposition is introduced and use quantum operation to mean the other ) .",
    "for @xmath33 , no matter which decomposition and basis are considered , there is superposition in part a , and thus part a can only be prepared via quantum operation .",
    "for example : for state @xmath34 , the local superposition in the @xmath35 basis is nonzero and quantum operation is needed for the preparation when this basis is chosen , while the local superposition between basis @xmath36 is zero and classical operation is enough for the preparation when this basis is chosen .",
    "thus , from the aspect of preparation , eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) shows the minimum amount of superposition produced in part a when preparing this state .    _ * theorem 1 : * _ for pure state @xmath37 , @xmath32 iff the state is a product state .    proof . for general pure state @xmath38 , by schmidt decomposition",
