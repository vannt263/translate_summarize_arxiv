    "the importance of magnetic fields in the star formation process is now widely acknowledged ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the zeeman effect in radio - frequency spectral lines is the only viable method for measuring the strength of the magnetic field in interstellar molecular clouds and star - forming regions .",
    "if the zeeman splitting is smaller than the linewidth , only the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field can be measured ; this is always the case for non - maser lines .    in this paper we discuss high spatial resolution zeeman observations in oh and absorption toward the ngc 6334 complex . in the remainder of  1 ,",
    "we review some details of the complex ;  2 contains details of the observations and reduction of the data . in  3 , we present the results of our observations , and  4 contains discussions about these results .",
    "ngc 6334 is a giant molecular cloud complex and star - forming region at a distance of 1.7 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "it lies about 0@xmath4.5 above the galactic plane and extends @xmath130@xmath5 parallel to it .",
    "the complex has been the subject of extensive studies at a variety of wavelengths .",
    "@xcite mapped the region at 6 cm wavelength with the vla .",
    "they found six discrete continuum sources that lie along a ridge of radio emission parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "three of these sources had been known from previous single dish observations by @xcite .",
    "rcm82 named these sources a to f , in order of increasing right ascension ( figures 1 & 2 , this paper ) .",
    "@xcite mapped the region with a 40@xmath6250 @xmath7 photometer and found six far infrared ( fir ) sources .",
    "of these , five lie along the ridge of radio emission ; an additional weaker source lies further south .",
    "the fir sources were labeled i through vi .",
    "another continuum source , i(n ) , was seen at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths ( @xcite 1978 ; @xcite 1982 ) ; i(n ) lies to the north of fir i and was not detected in the observations of @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected four co peaks within an extended region of emission .",
    "the nomenclature in this complex has become confused . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the convention of rcm82 for radio continuum sources .",
    "among the many phenomena associated with star formation in this complex are water masers ( @xcite ) , oh masers ( @xcite ) , methanol masers ( @xcite ) , bipolar outflows in ionized and molecular gas ( @xcite 1995 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and shocked @xmath8 emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have discussed a picture of sequential star formation in this complex ( @xcite 1978 ; @xcite ) in which the central parts of the complex are more evolved than the edges .",
    "this conclusion was mainly based on the distribution of indicators of star formation such as oh and @xmath9 masers and co , far - ir and 1 mm peaks .",
    "however , rcm82 point out that the picture is definitely more complex than simple sequential star formation .",
    "for example , source e , which lies at the edge of the complex , is an evolved source .",

    "was detected in oh 1665 and 1667 mhz absorption toward source a. we note that the magnetic field obtained from the formal fit in is of the same order although less than the magnetic field detected in oh . due to the blending in velocity in the gas , it is almost certain that optical depth effects will suppress any zeeman signature in the v profile ( @xcite ) , which may explain why we do not have a more significant detection of @xmath43 in toward source a.      the extended , featureless source d ( fig .",
    "4b ) coincides with the fir peak ii of @xcite and an @xmath48 maser ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on their 6 cm radio continuum measurements , rcm82 found that a zams o6.5 star would be required to ionize this region .",
    "@xcite found that irs 24 , which lies close to the center of the continuum source and has a dereddened k magnitude corresponding to a zams o6 star , is the dominant source of excitation in this source .",
    "source d is located at the edge of a hole in the molecular gas emission , as seen in k98 s co data .",
    "their models suggest that the molecular hydrogen column density toward source d is the lowest of any source in the ngc 6334 complex .",
    "@xcite used near - infrared star counts to find the extinction through ngc 6334 ; their estimates also suggest that the extinction toward source d is less than that toward any other sources .",
    "this hole in the molecular gas emission is clearly reflected in our high resolution image of source d ( fig .",
    "4b ) , where no oh absorption is detected east of the continuum peak .    bb95 model their profile toward fir i ( source f ) as an emission component centered at @xmath33 = @xmath65.2 km @xmath2 and an absorption component near @xmath33 = @xmath61.6 km @xmath2 , and note that the source of the absorbing gas at this velocity is unclear .",
    "this absorption feature is also found near fir ii ( toward source d ) .",
    "the co profiles nearest to fir ii ( of ddw77 with a 70@xmath17 beam and of pvg86 with a 1@xmath5.7 beam ) are broad ( @xmath0 @xmath1 7 km @xmath2 ) but appear to be gaussian and single - peaked near @xmath63 km @xmath2 .",
    "our oh absorption profiles in this region show considerable velocity structure (  3.2 ) . however ,",
    "when convolved with a 43@xmath17 beam , our oh spectra show two components near @xmath33 @xmath1 @xmath65.0 and @xmath61.6 km @xmath2 .",
    "this result suggests that both velocity components identified by bb95 lie on the near side of the region source d.      source e is the northernmost compact radio continuum source in ngc 6334 .",
    "rcm82 found that a zams o7.5 star would be required to produce this region .",
    "@xcite detected at least 12 faint k - band sources toward source e ; these sources were not detected in the j- or h - bands .",
    "they suggested that these are a cluster of b0-b0.5 zams stars which collectively ionize the region .",
    "the profile of bb95 closest to source e is the one 1@xmath5 northwest of fir i. the profile displays a peak near @xmath1 @xmath68 km @xmath2 , and a lower level wing extends up to @xmath1 @xmath222 km @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly enough , the oh absorption profile toward the north of source e , when convolved with a 43@xmath17 beam for comparison with bb95 s data , is almost identical to this profile in shape and extent , except that the peak of the absorption is at @xmath66.6 km @xmath2 .",
    "the absorption is present at all these velocities .",
    "a principal goal of zeeman effect measurements is to estimate the importance of the magnetic field to the dynamics and evolution of star forming regions like ngc 6334 . such estimates also require that other physical parameters of the regions be known , such as internal velocity dispersion , proton column density , radius , and total mass .",
    "c99 has summarized these concepts . here",
    ", we apply such a simple analysis of magnetic effects to ngc 6334 sources a , e , and d , especially source a for which physical quantities are best known .    cc radius ( r ) & 0.8 pc mass ( m ) & 2200 @xmath51 @xmath52 & 4.8 @xmath18 @xmath53 @xmath30 @xmath54 & 3 @xmath18 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 & 40 k @xmath58 & 2.6 km @xmath24 @xmath43 & 150 @xmath3 g    first , we must estimate other relevant physical parameters .",
    "column densities can be estimated from molecular line data such as that reported here , subject to several assumptions .",
    "for source a , we estimate column densities from our own oh data .",
    "we use an average value of n(oh)/@xmath27 equal to 6 @xmath18 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 to calculate n(oh ) toward this source .",
    "the excitation temperature can not be measured based on absorption studies alone .",
    "we adopt @xmath27 = 40 k. k98 found @xmath57 = 50 k toward source a based on co studies .",
    "@xcite found @xmath57 @xmath1 40 k from their ammonia studies .",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath27 remains constant over this source , and it may vary down to the dark cloud value of 10 k in the densest parts of the source .",
    "however , the results will scale with the temperature . the conversion ratio @xmath52/n(oh)=2 @xmath18 @xmath62 was taken from @xcite for s106 .",
    "this ratio is an order of magnitude higher than the ratio for dark clouds determined by @xcite .",
    "however , we find n(oh)/@xmath63 @xmath1 5 @xmath18 @xmath64 , where we have used @xmath63 = 50 mag . , based on pvg86 s estimate of @xmath63 @xmath1 40 mag . toward a position about 1@xmath5 to the southeast of a. using the standard conversion ratio of @xmath52/@xmath63 @xmath1 @xmath65 , we obtain @xmath52/n(oh ) @xmath1 2 @xmath18 @xmath62 in agreement with @xcite , which justifies our use of the @xcite value rather than the dark cloud value . using this conversion ratio ,",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath52 = 4.8 @xmath18 @xmath66 @xmath60 .",
    "note that this value compares well with the value of @xmath52= 1.3 @xmath18 @xmath67 @xmath60 obtained by kjpb97 based on their co excitation models , and with k98 s value of 8.9 @xmath18 @xmath66 @xmath60 based on co integrated intensity .",
    "next , the most problematic parameter is the radius of the molecular cloud .",
    "k98 report a range of values for the radius based on their co and cs emission studies . using the average value of @xmath52 = 4.8 @xmath18 @xmath66 @xmath60 and different values for the radius , we estimated the mass and proton density toward source a. the best value of the radius",
    "was then taken to be that for which the mass of the molecular cloud most closely matched the mass obtained by kjpb97 from their co data .",
    "further , this adopted value of the radius ( 0.8 pc ) matches well with the radius of the molecular cloud in @xmath68 2@xmath231 ( 0.8 pc ) and cs 3@xmath232 ( 0.7 pc ) from kjpb97 .",
    "results of our analysis for source a are given in table 4 .",
    "note that our value for the proton density is @xmath1 2 higher than their value .",
    "for source e , where some of the above parameters are not available , we adopt a value of @xmath69 = 6.3 @xmath18 @xmath70 @xmath60 from k98 , as derived from co excitation model calculations .",
    "similarly , for source d , we use their value of @xmath69 = 2.2 @xmath18 @xmath70 @xmath60 .",
    "the most straightforward estimate of the importance of the magnetic field comes from the relation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the average proton column density of the cloud , and @xmath73 is the average static magnetic field in the cloud that would completely support it against self gravity .",
    "note that the magnetic field in a cloud can be described in terms of a static component @xmath74 , and a time - dependent component @xmath75 .",
    "it is likely that the zeeman effect primarily samples the static component ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "if the actual field in the cloud is comparable to @xmath73 , then the field can be judged dynamically important to the region .",
    "for source a , we find @xmath73 = 500 @xmath3 g , compared to an estimated total field strength of 300 @xmath3 g .",
    "following c99 , we have used total magnetic field strength b equal to 2 times @xmath43 , and @xmath76 equal to 3 times @xmath77 . for source e , we find @xmath73 = 600 @xmath3 g , compared to an estimated total field strength of 400 @xmath3 g .",
    "again , for source d , we find @xmath73 = 220 @xmath3 g , compared to an estimated total field strength of 190 @xmath3 g .",
    "therefore , subject to the obvious uncertainties in such estimates , we judge the magnetic field in each region to be comparable to if slightly less than the critical field . in all three regions , the magnetic field should be dynamically significant , providing an important source of support against self gravity .",

    "all symbols used in the discussion that follows are described in table 5 .",
    "we find @xmath44/c = 2.9 , indicating that the motions in the cloud are supersonic .",
    "this is a common result in molecular clouds ; c99 has found that motions are supersonic by about a factor of 5 .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath44/@xmath78 indicates that they are sub - alfvnic , suggesting that these motions may be the result of alfvn waves in the cloud .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 @xmath86 0.03 , close to the average value of 0.04 determined by c99 , suggesting that the magnetic fields are important , and that the magnetic pressure dominates over the thermal pressure .",
    "the observed mass - to - magnetic flux ratio with respect to the critical value is 1.6 , indicating that the cloud is magnetically supercritical .",
    "also , @xmath83 @xmath86 @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the kinetic and magnetic energy densities are in approximate equilibrium , which would be expected if the magnitude of the fluctuating part of the magnetic field was approximately equal to the magnitude of the static field ( c99 ) .",
    "finally , we find that 2@xmath83 @xmath22 @xmath84 @xmath86 0.7@xmath81 .",
    "hence , since the external pressure term , which is not included here , will act in the same sense as the gravitational term , the cloud is in approximate virial equilibrium .",
    "1 ) . we have observed oh and in absorption toward ngc 6334 with the vla .",
    "the oh absorption profiles are relatively narrow ( @xmath0 @xmath1 3 km @xmath2 ) and single - peaked toward most of the sources .",
    "toward source a , the oh profiles display an east - west velocity gradient ; this gradient has the same sign as the velocity gradient detected in molecular emission lines by kjpb97 .",
    "the oh profiles toward source a also display a north - south velocity gradient which is in agreement with a similar gradient discovered in h92@xmath49 recombination lines , and which likely indicates a bipolar outflow of material into the lobes seen in the continuum source .",
    "no oh absorption is detected toward the continuum peak of source c itself .",
    "toward source d , the oh profiles show considerable velocity structure west of the continuum peak ; no oh absorption is detected east of the continuum peak .",
    "the profiles toward ngc 6334 contain several blended velocity components , except toward source c , where the profile at negative velocities is almost single - peaked .    2 ) .",
    "we have calculated n(oh)/@xmath27 toward the continuum sources .",
    "toward source a , we observe an increase in n(oh)/@xmath27 in an east - west ridge north of the continuum peak ; there is also an increase toward the eastern and western boundaries of the northern and southern lobes .    3 ) .",
    "magnetic fields of the order of 200 @xmath3 g have been detected toward some of the sources in this complex . in oh",

    "we have three or four independent beams across source a ; measurements at different positions in 1667 mhz suggest that the magnetic field increases going north of the continuum peak .",
    "the signs of the detected magnetic fields are opposite in going from sources e and d ( where we have a detection in absorption ) to source a ( where we have a detection in oh ) .",
    "if the field detected in to the northwest of d is real , there is also a sign reversal in the field in going from d and e to the position northwest of d.    5 ) .",
    "we have used various observed and derived parameters to study the implications of the detected magnetic fields toward sources a , e , and d. in all cases , it appears that the detected fields are of the order of the critical field needed to support the molecular cloud associated with that source against gravitational collapse .",
