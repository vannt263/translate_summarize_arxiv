    "two - photon one - electron ionization is one of the fundamental non - linear processes in the light - matter interaction with various spectroscopic applications . in the past , however , most experiments were focused on the two - photon ionization of atomic outer shell electrons @xcite . only with the recent advancements in free - electron lasers ( fel ) ,",
    "the study of non - linear processes in atoms and molecules at extreme ultraviolet and x - ray energies became feasible @xcite and renewed an interest in inner - shell excitation and ionization processes .",
    "one of the first experiments utilising fel facilities used electron or ion spectrometers to study the two - photon ionization of 4@xmath1 electron of neutral xe atom @xcite and 1@xmath2 electron of heliumlike ne@xmath3 ion @xcite . meanwhile , modern fel facilities reach beam intensities of about @xmath4 w/@xmath5 , although the non - resonant two - photon ionization of inner - shell electrons still remains a challenge due to small cross sections .",
    "experimentally , the two - photon ionization can be measured by collecting the @xmath0-fluorescence .",
    "this fluoresce radiation emitted by bound electrons decaying into the @xmath0-shell vacancy is a direct signature of the two - photon ionization process .",
    "this experimental approach has been utilized in the case of @xmath0-shell ionization of neutral ge @xcite and zr @xcite atoms .",
    "first detailed calculations of the two - photon ionization of atomic hydrogen were performed by zernik within non - relativistic dipole approximation @xcite more than 50 years ago . in this work",
    ", he also introduced the well - known @xmath6 scaling of the total cross section with the nuclear charge @xmath7 for non - resonant two - photon ionization and , hence , provided an estimate of a total cross section for all hydrogenlike ions .",
    "however , later in refs .",
    "@xcite , complete relativistic calculations were carried out which demonstrated that quite strong deviation from this scaling occurs due to relativistic effects .",
    "recently , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the relativistic effects have also been investigated in the two - photon above - threshold ionization of low-@xmath7 hydrogenlike ions .",
    "although the relativistic effects have been found rather important , no systematic relativistic calculations have been carried out until now for the two - photon ionization of neutral atoms .    in this paper , we investigate the relativistic and screening effect contributions to the total two - photon @xmath0-shell ionization cross section of neutral atoms . in particular , we consider photon energies below the ionization threshold so that no single photon @xmath0-shell ionization is possible . in sec .",

    "the evaluation of expression ( [ generaltransitionamplitude ] ) requires a summation to be carried out over the complete spectrum of intermediate states @xmath29 .",
    "the operator @xmath30 denotes the one - particle transition operator describing the electron - photon interaction .",

    "then , within the independent particle approximation , the final state after an ionization process is obtained by applying the electron creation ( @xmath44 ) and annihilation ( @xmath45 ) operators to the initial state and coupling the initial atom and hole angular momenta using a clebsh - gordan coefficient @xmath46 .",

    "@xcite was employed .",
    "this technique allows us to reduce infinite sum over the intermediate states in ( [ finaltransitionamplitude ] ) to finite sum over pseudospectrum .",
    "this approach has been previously successfully applied , for example , in the calculations of two - photon decay rates of heliumlike ions @xcite or cross sections of x - ray rayleigh scattering @xcite .",
    "the continuum - state wavefunctions were obtained by numerical solutions of the dirac equation with help of the radial package @xcite .    in order to account for the screening effects",
    ", we solve the dirac equation with a screening potential , which partially accounts for the interelectronic interaction .",
    "we use the core - hartree potential , which corresponds to a potential created by all bound electrons except of the active electron .",
    "the core - hartree potential reproduces the electron binding energies in excellent agreement to the experimental values within @xmath94 error for all atoms under consideration . to analyse the sensitivity to the choice of potential , in addition to the core - hartre potential ,",
    "two different screening potentials were also used .",
    "the potential taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer as the `` salvat '' potential and salvat potential modified in a way to reproduce experimental binding energies @xmath95 , referred to as `` salvat @xmath95 '' .",
    "all results presented were calculated using the core - hartree potential , except for fig .",
    "[ fig.potentialcomparison ] where results from the different potentials are compared .",
    "in addition , in order to check the consistency of our results , we carried out the calculations in length and velocity gauges .",
    "the results for both gauges were in a perfect agreement as expected for any local potential .",
    "even though the agreement of the two gauges does not prove validity of the results , it shows that the effective single - electron amplitudes ( [ finaltransitionamplitude ] ) are properly implemented in our codes .",
    "even though the formalism derived in sec .",
    "[ sec.theory ] applies generally for neutral atoms as well as ions , detailed calculations have been carried out for @xmath0-shell two - photon ionization of neutral neon , germanium , xenon , and uranium atoms . specifically , the contributions of relativistic and screening effects to the total cross section have been investigated . in this section , we will compare cross sections for @xmath0-shell ionization of hydrogenlike and neutral atoms .",
    "since there are two electrons in the @xmath0-shell of neutral atoms but only one electron in the @xmath0-shell hydrogenlike ions , we introduce an additional factor of two in the hydrogenlike calculation for the sake of comparison .",
    "we begin by comparing the ionization of hydrogenlike and neutral atoms in terms of the total cross section as a function of so called excess energy .",
    "excess energy represents the factor by which the combined photon energy exceeds the ionization threshold , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "figure [ fig.potentialcomparison ] presents the total cross sections for ionization of neutral ( solid black ) as well as for h - like ( dashed - dotted red ) neon , germanium , xenon , and uranium by linearly polarized photons .",
    "we can notice that the first resonant behaviour in the total cross section occurs in lower energy for h - like ions than for neutral atoms .",
    "this resonant behaviour occurs when the single photon energy reaches the @xmath97 transition energy .",
    "although the @xmath98 state is generally occupied for neutral atoms , the resonant two - photon ionization can be understood as follows .",
    "the @xmath98 electron is ionized by the first photon and the corresponding vacancy is then filled by excitation of the @xmath99 electron by the second photon .",
    "since the present work is devoted to the non - resonant ionization , the @xmath97 resonant energy and the ionization threshold define the energy range of current interest .",
    "the more significant difference between neutral and h - like systems lies in the decrease of the total cross section near the ionization threshold .",
    "this cross section reduction is strongest for elements with nuclear charge @xmath100 and becomes much less significant for heavy atoms . in the case of h - like ions ,",
    "no such behaviour has been predicted and the total two - photon ionization cross section is slowly decreasing in non - resonant energy regions @xcite , which we also confirm by the present calculations .",
    "this means that the change of the total cross section for light neutral elements close to the ionization threshold can be directly linked to the deviation of the binding potential from the coulomb potential created by the nucleus . in the next subsection",
    ", we will investigate these effects ( which we refer to as `` screening effects '' ) further by looking at the @xmath101 and @xmath102 partial waves of the free electron .",
    "these partial waves strongly dominate others as they are the only allowed by two electric dipole ( @xmath103 ) transitions .",
    "figure [ fig.potentialcomparison ] shows also the comparison between the three screening potentials ( solid black , dashed green , and blue curves ) introduced in sec . [ sec.computation ] .",
    "we see that for low-@xmath7 and medium-@xmath7 atoms , the core - hartree and salvat potentials differ in the magnitudes of the total cross section by less than @xmath104 .",
    "this is partially caused by the calculated value of the binding energy . when the salvat potential was modified to reach perfect agreement with the experimental binding energies , the cross section difference from the core - hartree calculation",
    "was reduced to about @xmath105 . therefore , even though part of the difference between the cross sections as predicted by each potential arises from the difference of binding energies , the distinct potential formulations also result in a deviation . despite the small magnitude differences ,",
    "all screening potentials predict similar energy dependence of the total cross section .",
    "the agreement of these potentials justifies that the obtained behaviour and magnitude is not very sensitive to the choice of potential .",
    "we ascribe the difference between the core - hartree and salvat calculations as an uncertainty of presented results .",
    "the uncertainty decreases from 25@xmath106 for ne to 10@xmath106 for u. we restrict all further discussion to the use of core - hartree potential .      to gain deeper understanding of the total cross section results , we now wish to look at the dominant @xmath103 ionization channels . in this approximation ,",
    "only the @xmath107 multipole of each of the two photons is considered .",
    "since we are interested in ionization of a @xmath99 electron with zero orbital angular momentum @xmath108 , @xmath103 transition allows only two possible ionization channels ; @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , only @xmath101 and @xmath102 partial waves of the free electron are allowed in dipole approximation .",
    "while both of these channels are open for linear and unpolarized light , only the @xmath111 channel is open for circularly polarized light .",
    "this restriction comes from the conservation of the angular momentum projection .",
    "since we are considering two equally circularly polarized photons , the angular momentum projection must change by @xmath112 , then @xmath113 is always the case , making the final @xmath101state forbidden .",
    "this is a point worth remembering .",
    "as we will soon see , the absence of the @xmath114 channel leads to a magnification of the screening effects , which increases the probability of experimental detection of these effects .",
    "figure [ fig.partialwave ] shows the plots of the partial - wave cross sections considering only the @xmath101 or @xmath102 partial - waves of the continuum electron as a function of excess energy .",
    "results are presented for ionization of h - like ( dash - dotted red and short - dashed orange ) and neutral ( solid black and long - dashed green ) neon , germanium , xenon , and uranium atoms by linearly polarized light .",
    "we can see that the energy dependence of the partial - wave cross section of h - like ions fulfils our expectation we gained from fig .",
    "[ fig.potentialcomparison ] .",
    "the cross sections of @xmath115 channel always dominates the @xmath114 channel and the two curves remain approximately parallel .",
    "analogously to the total cross section , both channels can be considered constant in non - resonant energy region up to the proximity of the @xmath116 resonant energy .",
    "similar behaviour can be seen in the case of neutral uranium .",
    "however , for neutral atoms with lower nuclear charge , we observe a competition of the two partial waves in near - threshold energy region .",
    "a drop of the dominant channel occurs and creates a minimum of the cross section , analogous to the cooper minimum in single photon ionization process .",
    "the minimum is most pronounced for neon , for which the cross section of the @xmath114 channel is greater than the dominant @xmath115 channel in an energy region from the ionization threshold up to a crossing point of the channels at @xmath117 .",
    "this crossing of the ionization channels is present for atoms with nuclear charges in the range @xmath118 .",
    "although for elements in this range other than neon , the crossing point lies in lower energies and the effects are thus weaker .    in the top",
    "left part of each of the figures [ fig.partialwave ] , the ratio of total cross section for ionization by circularly @xmath119 and linearly @xmath120 light are also presented . according to the known estimate @xmath121 @xcite",
    ", the ratio should be always approximately equal to @xmath122 in non - resonant energy region . while this holds true for the h - like ions ( dash - dotted red curve ) , in the case of neutral atoms ( solid black curve ) , the screening effects result in a strong deviation from the estimated value .",

    "moreover , in ref . @xcite it is shown that in two - photon ionization of h - like ions , the relativistic effects can not be neglected for heavy atoms .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to expect similar behaviour for ionization of neutral atoms .",
    "it is the purpose of this subsection to show the relative strengths and nuclear charge dependences of both these effects as well as their contributions to the total cross section .",

    "the second deviation lies in the low-@xmath7 region and is present only for the ionization of neutral atoms .",
    "let us start with the deviation in the low-@xmath7 region .",

    "this increase rapidly weakens with increasing nuclear charge as we would expect .",
    "however , for @xmath124 , the screening effects result in decrease of the cross section , with a maximum at @xmath132 .",
    "this trough in the scaling factor directly reflects the decrease of cross section we have seen in figs .",
    "[ fig.potentialcomparison ] and [ fig.partialwave ] .",

    "[ fig.effects ] comes from the relativistic effects .",
    "the importance of these effects continuously grows with increasing nuclear charge @xmath7 .",
    "we can also see that unlike screening effects , relativistic effects are independent of polarization .",
    "this means that relativistic effects influence all partial waves in a same way . for ionization of uranium by light of any polarization ,",
    "the relativistic effects decrease the total cross section by about a factor of two .",
    "we would expect , that the relativistic effects would be stronger for the ionization of hydrogenlike ions than for ionization of neutral atoms , since the electron binding energies of hydrogenlike ions are higher .",
    "however , from fig . [ fig.effects ] , we can see , that the deviation of the scaling factor ( and therefore the cross section itself ) for neutral atoms due to relativistic effects is similar as for h - like ions .      due to the relativistic and screening effects , corrections to the non - resonant two - photon ionization scaling law @xmath136 increase in complexity .",
    "the magnitude of these effects depends mainly on the nuclear charge but screening effects also depend on the incident photon energies and polarizations .",
    "that is why we present the @xmath7-dependence of the total cross section in addition to the scaling factor given in previous subchapter .",
    "figure [ fig.zscaling ] shows calculated cross sections for elements in the range @xmath123 for two energies ; @xmath124 ( solid black ) and @xmath125 ( long - dashed green ) as well as the scaling law ( short - dashed red ) . total cross sections for other photon energies",
    "@xmath137 lay in between the two corresponding lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.zscaling ] .",
    "the cross section difference between the two energies arises due to the screening effects as explained before .",
    "figure [ fig.zscaling ] also shows experimental values for the @xmath0-shell ionization of neutral ge and zr atoms .",
    "we can see that our result for ge is close to the experimental value as well as for zr , which lies within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "however , in another experiment , doumy , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the two - photon ionization of heliumlike ne to be @xmath138 @xmath139 s. theoretical calculations @xcite of this cross section resulted in a discrepant value , lower by about three orders of magnitude .",
    "we applied our formalism for the case of ne@xmath3 as well , and obtained a cross section of 3.1@xmath140 @xmath139 s which is in an agreement with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "thus , the three orders of magnitude deviation obtained suggests a resonant enhancement of the cross section and can be explained by broader spectral bandwidth of the fel employed .",
    "the non - resonant two - photon ionization of neutral atoms has been described in fully relativistic theory based on second - order perturbation theory and dirac equation . using the independent particle approximation and particle - hole formalism ,",
    "the many - electron transition amplitude describing the electron - photon interaction has been simplified to one - electron amplitude .",
    "an expression of the total two - photon ionization cross section has been obtained using the framework of density matrix theory and the transition amplitude .",
    "detailed calculations of the total cross section have been carried out for ionization of neon , germanium , xenon , and uranium atoms using three screening potentials .",
    "our results show that both relativistic as well as screening effects need to be considered in the calculation of two - photon ionization cross section .",
    "relativistic effects significantly decrease the total cross section for heavy atoms , for the case of uranium , they decrease the cross section by a factor of two .",
    "screening effects are highly sensitive to the photon energy and polarization as well as to the nuclear charge of the atom . in general , screening effects increase the cross section for low-@xmath7 atoms by a factor of up to 1.5 .",
    "however , for near - threshold photon energies , we observe a minimum in the total cross section which has pure screening origin .",
    "due to a single allowed ionization channel , screening effects are most pronounced for ionization by circularly polarized light . for ionization of ne , the cross section drops by a factor of three in the near - threshold energy region . both , the relativistic as well as the screening effect will likely affect the photoelectron angular distribution of the two - photon ionization of neutral atoms .",
    "therefore , it would be of great interest to use the theoretical formalism described above to also investigate the angular distribution , especially in the case , where the minimum of the cross section occurs",
    ". this will be the concern of our further study ."
