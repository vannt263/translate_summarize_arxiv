    "the conductance decays rapidly due to the finite ribbon width effect in zigzag ribbons  @xcite while the conductance around @xmath75 remains unity in armchair ribbons ( fig.[fig2](b ) ) .",
    "now let us see the effect of short - ranged impurities ( sri ) .",

    ", the conductance decays exponentially even for single - channel transport .",
    "this result is similar to that previously obtained in zigzag ribbons .",

    "similar results are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in which only short - ranged disorder at edge of ribbon is considered .",
    "the absence of localization in the single - channel region can be understood from the dirac equation including the impurity potential term @xmath77 with armchair edge boundary . to consider the amplitude of backward scattering , we introduce the @xmath7-matrix defined as @xmath78 according to ref.@xcite , @xmath77 is written as @xmath79 with @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the local potential due to impurities for @xmath82 or @xmath36 . here @xmath83 with the normalization condition of @xmath84 is the real function which has an appreciable amplitude in the region where @xmath85 is smaller than a few times of the lattice constant , and decays rapidly with increasing @xmath85 .",
    "if only the lri are present , we can approximate @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the case of carbon nanotubes and zigzag nanoribbons , @xmath88 vanishes after the summation over @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u_inter ] ) since the phase factor @xmath90 strongly oscillates in the @xmath91-direction . however , this cancellation is not complete in an armchair nanoribbon because the averaging over the @xmath91-direction is restricted to the finite width of @xmath55 .",
    "this means that we can not neglect the contribution from scatterers particularly in the vicinity of the edges to @xmath88 .",
    "although @xmath88 becomes small after the summation , the symmetry of system changes for @xmath92 as we will see in the next subsection .",
    "now we evaluate the matrix elements of @xmath77 for the eigenstate @xmath93 with the eigen energy of eq.([eigenenergy ] ) which can be written as @xmath94 with the phase factor @xmath95 here it should be noted that the phase structure in eq.([wf ] ) is different between @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , and this internal phase structures are critical for the scattering matrix elements of armchair nanoribbons as we discuss in the following . using the above expression , we can obtain the scattering matrix element @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "\\label{eq15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that eq.([eq14 ] ) has the same form as that obtained for carbon nanotubes without inter - valley scattering ( @xmath98)@xcite . interestingly , in spite of the fact that armchair nanoribbons inevitably suffer from the inter - valley scattering due to the armchair edges ( @xmath99 ) , we can express the matrix element for the backward scattering as eq.([eq14 ] ) by including @xmath100 into @xmath101 in eq.([eq15 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the different phase structure between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in eq.([wf ] ) .",
    "we focus on the single - channel regime where only the lowest subband with @xmath102 crosses the fermi level . from eq.([eq : u_matel ] ) , the scattering amplitude from the propagating state @xmath103 to its backward state @xmath104 in the single - channel mode becomes identically zero , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath105 thus , since the lowest backward scattering matrix element of @xmath7-matrix vanishes , the decay of @xmath106 in the single channel energy regime is extremely slow as a function of the ribbon length as we have seen in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "however , the back - scattering amplitude in the second and much higher order does not vanish .",
    "hence the single - channel conduction is not exactly perfect like carbon nanotubes@xcite , but _",
    "nearly _ perfect in armchair nanoribbons .",
    "the present results of nearly perfect single - channel transport might be similar to those obtained in carbon nanotubes by solving the boltzmann transport equation , which is valid for incoherent systems in the absence of inter - valley scattering@xcite . however , our results are for the coherent system with inter - valley scattering by armchair edge and their physical mechanism is different .",
    "now we give a symmetry consideration to disordered graphene and graphene nanoribbons .",
    "if the inter - valley scattering is absent , _ i.e. _ @xmath107 , the hamiltonian @xmath108 becomes invariant under the transformation of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the complex - conjugate operator .",
    "this operation corresponds to the special time - reversal operation for pseudospins within each valley , and supports that the system has the symplectic symmetry .",
    "however , in the presence of inter - valley scattering due to sri , the invariance under @xmath111 is broken . in this case , the time reversal symmetry across two valleys described by the operator @xmath112 becomes relevant , which indicates orthogonal universality class .",
    "thus as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , graphene with lri belongs to symplectic symmetry , but that with sri belongs to orthogonal symmetry .",
    "however , in the disordered armchair ribbons , the special time - reversal symmetry within each valley is broken even in the case of lri .",
    "this is because @xmath99 as we have seen in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , irrespective of the range of impurities , the armchair ribbons are classified into orthogonal universality class .",
    "actually , the application of magnetic field shows rather strong magnetic field dependence on the inverse localization length in the regime of the weak magnetic field for both lri and sri cases ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of orthogonal universality class . here",
    ", the inverse localization length is evaluated by identifying @xmath113 . since the disordered zigzag nanoribbons are classified into unitary class for lri but orthogonal class for sri  @xcite",
    ", it should be noted that the universality crossover in nanographene system can occur not only due to the range of impurities but also due to the edge boundary conditions .",
    "in this work , we have numerically investigated the electronic transport in disordered armchair nanoribbons in the presence of short- and long - ranged impurities . in spite of the lack of well - separated two valley structures , the single - channel transport subjected to long - ranged impurities shows nearly perfect transmission , where the backward scattering matrix elements in the lowest order vanish as a manifestation of internal phase structures of the wavefunction .",
    "these results are contrast with the mechanism of perfectly conducting channel in disordered zigzag nanoribbons and metallic nanotubes where the well separation between two non - equivalent dirac points is essential to suppress the inter - valley scattering . within the born approximation ,",
    "this cancellation is satisfied even for sri , which can be clearly seen in fig.[fig2](b ) .",
    "the dependency of conductance on the fermi energy confirms our calculation about the difference between single- and multi - channel transport properties .",
    "the symmetry consideration classifies the armchair nanoribbons into orthogonal class .",
