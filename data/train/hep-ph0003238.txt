    "the exploration of physics with @xmath1-flavoured hadrons offers a very fertile testing ground for the standard model ( sm ) description of electroweak interactions .",
    "one of the key problems to be studied is the phenomenon of cp violation , which , although already discovered in 1964 by christenson , cronin , fitch and turlay in the neutral kaon system @xcite , is still one of the experimentally least constrained phenomena .",
    "another main topic is the study of rare @xmath1 decays induced by flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions @xmath2 , which are loop - suppressed in the sm and thus very sensitive to new - physics effects .    during the last few years",
    ", @xmath0 physics has received a lot of attention , both from theorists and experimentalists , and we are presently at the beginning of the @xmath0-factory era in particle physics .",
    "the babar ( slac ) , belle ( kek ) and hera - b ( desy ) detectors have already seen their first events , and cleo - iii ( cornell ) , cdf - ii and d0-ii ( fermilab ) will start taking data in the near future ( see @xcite for a recent experimental overview ) .",
    "although the physics potential of these experiments is very promising , it may well be that the `` definite '' answer in the search for new physics in @xmath0 decays will be left for second - generation @xmath0 experiments at hadron machines . in the following",
    ", we will give an overview of the @xmath0-physics potential of the lhc experiments atlas , cms and lhcb , with the main focus on sm physics .      among the most interesting aspects and unsolved mysteries[p :",
    "mystery ] of modern particle physics is the violation of cp symmetry .",
    "studies of cp violation are particularly exciting , as they may open a window to the physics beyond the sm .",
    "there are many interesting ways to explore cp violation , for instance through certain rare @xmath3- or @xmath4-meson decays ( a very recent comprehensive description of all aspects of cp symmetry and its violation can be found in ref .",
    ". however , for testing the sm description of cp violation in a quantitative way , the @xmath0 system appears to be most promising @xcite .      within the framework of the sm",
    ", cp violation is closely related to the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , connecting the electroweak eigenstates @xmath5 of the down , strange and bottom quarks with their mass eigenstates @xmath6 through the following unitary transformation : @xmath7 the elements of the ckm matrix describe charged - current couplings , as can be seen easily by expressing the nonleptonic charged - current interaction lagrangian in terms of the electroweak eigenstates ( [ ckm ] ) : @xmath8 where the gauge coupling @xmath9 is related to the gauge group su@xmath10(2 ) and the @xmath11 fields describe the charged @xmath12-bosons .    in the case of three generations , three generalized cabibbo - type angles @xcite and a single _ complex phase _",
    "@xcite are needed in order to parametrize the ckm matrix .",
    "this complex phase allows one to accommodate cp violation in the sm , as was pointed out by kobayashi and maskawa in 1973  @xcite .",
    "a closer look shows that cp - violating observables are proportional to the following combination of ckm matrix elements @xcite : @xmath13 which represents a measure of the `` strength '' of cp violation in the sm . since @xmath14",
    ", cp violation is a small effect .",
    "however , in scenarios of new physics @xcite , typically several additional complex couplings are present , leading to new sources of cp violation .",
    "as far as phenomenological applications are concerned , the following parametrization of the ckm matrix , the `` wolfenstein parametrization '' @xcite , which corresponds to a phenomenological expansion in powers of the small quantity @xmath15 , turns out to be very useful : @xmath16 the terms of @xmath17 can be taken into account systematically @xcite , and will play an important rle below .",
    "concerning tests of the ckm picture of cp violation , the central targets are the _ unitarity triangles _ of the ckm matrix .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix , which is described by @xmath18 leads to a set of 12 equations , consisting of 6 normalization and 6 orthogonality relations .",
    "the latter can be represented as 6 triangles in the complex plane , which all have the same area @xcite .",
    "however , in only two of them , all three sides are of comparable magnitude @xmath19 , while in the remaining ones , one side is suppressed relative to the others by @xmath20 or @xmath17 .",
    "the orthogonality relations describing the non - squashed triangles are given as follows : @xmath21 the two non - squashed triangles agree at leading order in the wolfenstein expansion , i.e.  at @xmath19 , so that we actually have to deal with a single triangle at this order , which is usually referred to as `` the '' unitarity triangle of the ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "however , in the lhc era , the experimental accuracy will be so tremendous that we will have to take into account the next - to - leading order terms of the wolfenstein expansion , and distinguish between the unitarity triangles described by ( [ ut1 ] ) and ( [ ut2 ] ) , which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut ] . here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related to the wolfenstein parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 through @xcite @xmath26 note the angles of the triangles , in particular those designated by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "these will be referred to frequently throughout this report .",
    "the sides @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the unitarity triangle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut](a ) are given as follows : @xmath33 and will also appear in the following discussion .    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]      among the rare @xmath34 decay processes that have been discussed in the literature",
    "are the radiative decays @xmath35 and @xmath36 , induced at the quark level by the @xmath37 and @xmath38 transitions , respectively @xcite .",
    "the interest for the former decay mode is related to the possibility of studying the @xmath39 electromagnetic penguin transition , which in the charm mesons is overwhelmed by long - distance contributions . in the case of @xmath34 , long- and short - distance contributions",
    "have been estimated to be of comparable size , and the branching fraction @xmath40 is predicted , in the sm , at the level of @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath34 decays can give information about cp violation and the weak ckm phases .",
    "promising channels are @xmath42 , in particular the one where the charmonium state is a @xmath43 , whose decay mode to @xmath44 can be easily identified . in this case , cp violation is due to the difference between the weak phases of the tree and penguin diagrams contributing to the decay . the cp asymmetry @xmath45 has been estimated : @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "interesting channels are also those having a light meson in the final state , e.g. @xmath47 and @xmath48 . however , in this case the sizeable rle played by the annihilation mechanism makes it difficult to predict the decay rates and the cp asymmetries .",
    "decay modes such as @xmath49 can also be considered , although considerable difficulties would be met in the experimental detection of @xmath50 and in the removal of the background from @xmath51 decays .    finally , the decay @xmath52 has been proposed as an interesting source of flavour - tagged @xmath53 mesons for the study of mixing and cp violation in the @xmath53 sector @xcite .",
    "atlas have studied the reconstruction of @xmath34 mesons using the decays @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 ( see  @xcite ) . for this study ,",
    "the following branching ratios have been assumed : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is estimated that after 3 years of running at low luminosity , it will be possible to fully reconstruct 12000 @xmath59 events and 3@xmath6010@xmath61 events in the @xmath62 channel .",
    "the statistics would allow a very precise determination of the @xmath34 mass and lifetime .",
    "the @xmath34 meson is of particular interest as a unique case to study the impact of qcd dynamics on weak decays .",
    "applications in flavour physics ( ckm parameters , rare decays , @xmath53 flavour tagging ) have also been considered in the literature .",
    "important theoretical questions that need further attention are the issues of quark - hadron duality for inclusive decays and , for exclusive modes , the importance of corrections to the heavy - quark and nonrelativistic limits , as well as corrections to the factorization approximation .",
    "the experimental feasibility for various observables needs likewise to be assessed in more detail .",
    "the aim of the present section has been to give a flavour of the special opportunities that exist , from a theoretical perspective , in studying the physics of the @xmath34 .",
    "some of these are realizable at the lhc , where it will be possible to investigate also the production , spectrum , lifetimes and decays of baryons containing two heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "it is to be hoped that the results summarized in this section will trigger more detailed experimental studies .",
    "the studies presented at and initiated by the workshop have clearly shown that the lhc is very well equipped and prepared to pursue a rigorous @xmath1 physics programme .",
    "the main emphasis in the studies presented here has been on exploring lhc s potential for measuring cp violating phenomena and , on the theory side , a meaningful extraction of information on the underlying mechanism on cp violation in the sm .",
    "most of the presented `` strategies '' aim at extracting the three angles of the unitarity triangle , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as well as @xmath63 , in as many different ways as possible ; any significant discrepancy between the extracted values or with the known lengths of the sides of the triangle would constitute evidence for new physics .",
    "apart from detailed studies of the @xmath64@xmath65 b factory `` benchmark modes '' , also the hadron collider `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath66 has been studied , and new strategies for measuring @xmath28 and @xmath29 from @xmath53 decays , which can not be accessed at @xmath64@xmath65 b factories , have been developed .",
    "we conclude that the three experiments are well prepared to solve the `` mystery of cp violation '' ( p.  ) .",
    "another important goal to be pursued is the measurement of b mixing parameters , and the studies summarized i m this report make clear that all 3 lhc experiments have excellent potential .",
    "there is sensitivity in one year s operation to a mass difference in the @xmath53 system far beyond the sm expectation , and similarly good prospects for a rapid measurement of the width difference .",
    "the second focus of the workshop was the assessment of lhc s reach in rare decays .",
    "the discussion centered on decay modes with the favourable experimental signature of two muons or one photon in the final state .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the decay @xmath67 with a sm branching ratio of @xmath68 can be seen within one year s running .",
    "it has also been shown that decay spectra of semimuonic rare decays like @xmath69 are accessible , which opens the possibility to extract information on short - distance ( new ) physics in a theoretically controlled way .",
    "lhc s full potential for rare decays has , however , not yet been fully plumbed , and further studies , in particular about the feasibility of inclusive measurements , are ongoing .    of the many other possible @xmath1-physics topics ,",
    "only a few could be marked out , and we have reported some recent developments in the theoretical description of nonleptonic decays and discussed a few issues in @xmath34 physics . the exploration of other exciting topics , such as physics with @xmath1 baryons or ( non - rare ) semileptonic decays , to name only a few , has to await a second round of workshops .                        for reviews , see , for instance , y. grossman , y. nir and r. rattazzi , hep  ph/9701231 ; + m. gronau and d. london , phys .  rev .  * d55 * , 2845 ( 1997 ) ; + y. nir and h.r .",
