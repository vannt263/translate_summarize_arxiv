    "in recent years , corrections to inclusive quarkonium production cross sections and polarizations through next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling @xmath6 have been computed for both hadroproduction @xcite and photoproduction @xcite .",
    "these computations have been carried out in the context of the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization conjecture  @xcite , which states that the inclusive production cross section to produce a quarkonium @xmath9 in a collision of particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 here , the @xmath13 are the short - distance coefficients ( sdcs ) , which can be computed in perturbation theory and which correspond to the production of a heavy quark - antiquark pair @xmath14 in a specific color and angular - momentum state @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16 are nrqcd long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) , which parametrize the nonperturbative part of the production process .    because the ldmes have a known scaling with @xmath17 , the heavy - quark velocity in the quarkonium rest frame @xcite , the sum in eq .",

    "for example , one can fit the hadroproduction cross - section data @xcite and polarization data @xcite simultaneously @xcite , but the ldmes that are obtained yield a prediction for the photoproduction cross section that is larger than the hera data from the h1 collaboration @xcite by factors of 48 at the highest value of @xmath5 at which the cross section has been measured @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can fit the predictions for the hadroproduction and photoproduction cross sections to the experimental data @xcite , but the ldmes that are obtained lead to predictions of large transverse polarization in hadroproduction at large @xmath5 , in disagreement with the experimental data @xcite .",

    "@xcite that the @xmath36 production data that were measured by the lhcb collaboration @xcite are incompatible with the ldmes that were extracted in ref .  @xcite from hadroproduction and photoproduction cross - section data .",

    "@xcite , there is a very large cancellation between the contributions from the @xmath37}$ ] and @xmath38}$ ] channels @xcite , and , hence , the remainder may be strongly dependent on uncertainties from uncalculated higher - order contributions .",
    "these difficulties provide motivation for calculations of quarkonium production cross sections beyond nlo accuracy in @xmath6 .",
    "an approach that simplifies computations beyond nlo in @xmath6 is to compute rates at leading power ( lp ) or next - to - leading power ( nlp ) in @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the charm - quark mass and @xmath5 is the quarkonium transverse momentum .",
    "lp contributions can be factorized into semi - inclusive partonic cross sections to produce a specific single parton convolved with one - parton fragmentation functions ( ffs ) @xcite .",
    "nlp contributions can be factorized into semi - inclusive partonic cross sections to produce two specific partons convolved with two - parton ffs @xcite .",
    "calculations of these fragmentation contributions , at any given order in @xmath6 , are much simpler than a full fixed - order calculation .",
    "furthermore , the lp- and nlp - factorization frameworks are natural ones within which to resum large logarithms of @xmath7 . of course ,",
    "because the lp and nlp contributions represent the leading and first subleading terms in an expansion in powers of @xmath3 , one would not expect them to be valid unless @xmath5 is significantly greater than @xmath4 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that lp contributions beyond nlo in @xmath6 are important in @xmath0 hadroproduction . with the inclusion of these contributions ,",
    "the ldmes that are extracted from the prompt hadroproduction cross sections alone yield predictions for the @xmath0 polarization at large @xmath5 that are near zero and are in agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "one deficiency in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite is that it does not take into account the effects of feeddown from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states to the @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we remedy that deficiency and extend the application of the lp - factorization approach by computing lp - fragmentation contributions to direct @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 production .",
    "we extract ldmes by fitting to the tevatron and lhc production cross sections , and we use those ldmes to predict the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 polarizations .",
    "our predictions for the prompt @xmath0 and @xmath2 polarizations agree well with the existing high-@xmath5 lhc data , but the prompt @xmath0 polarization is in only fair agreement with the high-@xmath5 tevatron run  ii data . our predictions for the @xmath1 polarizations will be tested soon at the lhc . while the results in this paper do not resolve the discrepancies between the nrqcd predictions and the @xmath0 photoproduction and @xmath36 hadroproduction data , they do provide a consistent description of the existing spin - triplet charmonium hadroproduction data at high @xmath5 .",
