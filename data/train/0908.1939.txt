    "the famous lvy theorem ( see , e.g. , [ [ scor ] ] , theorem 3.2.2 ) asserts that every continuous local martingale with zero initial value and non - random absolutely continuous quadratic characteristic is a ( non - homogeneous ) wiener process whose drift coefficient is zero and diffusion coefficient is the derivative of the quadratic characteristic .",
    "thus the distribution ( this is the abbreviation for `` the system of finite - dimensional distributions '' ) of a starting from zero continuous local martingale is determined ( explicitly ! ) by its quadratic characteristic provided the latter is non - random ( and , in the original formulation , absolutely continuous , but this demand can be easily waived ) .",
    "the main goal of the present article is to extend this result to the case when the characteristic may be random ( and an analogue of the absolute continuity condition is retained ) .",
    "it is accomplished in section 1 .",
    "the refusal from non - randomness of the quadratic characteristic deprives us of the possibility to find the distribution of the martingale explicitly , which in lvy s case exhausts the proof .",
    "thus , our approach involves another techniques .    in section 3 , this characterization is used to derive new functional limit theorems for sequences of martingales .",
