    "understanding what items will be retained in the public consciousness , and why , is a question of fundamental interest in many domains , including marketing , politics , entertainment , and social media ; as we all know , many items barely register , whereas others catch on and take hold in many people s minds .",
    "an active line of recent computational work has employed a variety of perspectives on this question .",
    "building on a foundation in the sociology of diffusion @xcite , researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads , with domains of interest including blogs @xcite , email @xcite , on - line commerce @xcite , and social media @xcite .",
    "there has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how different media sources convey information @xcite and ways in which people react differently to information on different topics @xcite .    beyond all these factors",
    ", however , one s everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed  the choice of words , the way it is phrased  might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people s minds .",
    "concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans , marketing phrases , or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable , `` catchy , '' or otherwise compelling .    our first challenge in exploring this hypothesis is to develop a notion of `` successful '' language that is precise enough to allow for quantitative evaluation .",
    "we also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered  highly - cited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural , political , or social narrative , and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extra - linguistic contexts . is the form of the language adding an effect _ beyond or independent of _ these ( obviously very crucial ) factors ? to investigate the question , one needs a way of controlling  as much as possible  for the role that the surrounding context of the language plays .",
    "[ [ the - present - work - i - evaluating - language - based - memorability ] ] the present work ( i ) : evaluating language - based memorability + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    defining what makes an utterance memorable is subtle , and scholars in several domains have written about this question .",
    "there is a rough consensus that an appropriate definition involves elements of both _ recognition _  people should be able to retain the quote and recognize it when they hear it invoked  and _ production _  people should be motivated to refer to it in relevant situations @xcite .",
    "one suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings , mood , or situation of an individual , a group , or a culture ( the _ zeitgeist _ ) : `` certain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone .",
    "we hear them ... and store them away for future use '' @xcite .",
    "none of these observations , however , serve as definitions , and indeed , we believe it desirable to not pre - commit to an abstract definition , but rather to adopt an operational formulation based on external human judgments . in designing our study ,",
    "we focus on a domain in which ( i ) there is rich use of language , some of which has achieved deep cultural penetration ; ( ii ) there already exist a large number of external human judgments  perhaps implicit , but in a form we can extract ; and ( iii ) we can control for the setting in which the text was used .",
    "specifically , we use the complete scripts of roughly 1000 movies , representing diverse genres , eras , and levels of popularity , and consider which lines are the most `` memorable '' . to acquire memorability labels , for each sentence in each script , we determine whether it has been listed as a `` memorable quote '' by users of the widely - known imdb ( the internet movie database ) , and also estimate the number of times it appears on the web .",
    "both of these serve as memorability metrics for our purposes .",
    "when we evaluate properties of memorable quotes , we compare them with quotes that are not assessed as memorable , but were spoken by the same character , at approximately the same point in the same movie .",
    "this enables us to control in a fairly fine - grained way for the confounding effects of context discussed above : we can observe differences that persist even after taking into account both the speaker and the setting .    in a pilot validation study",
    ", we find that human subjects are effective at recognizing the more imdb - memorable of two quotes , even for movies they have not seen .",
    "this motivates a search for features intrinsic to the text of quotes that signal memorability .",
    "in fact , comments provided by the human subjects as part of the task suggested two basic forms that such textual signals could take : subjects felt that ( i ) memorable quotes often involve a _ distinctive _ turn of phrase ; and ( ii ) memorable quotes tend to invoke _ general _ themes that are nt tied to the specific setting they came from , and hence can be more easily invoked for future ( out of context ) uses .",
    "we test both of these principles in our analysis of the data .",
    "[ [ the - present - work - ii - what - distinguishes - memorable - quotes ] ] the present work ( ii ) : what distinguishes memorable quotes + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    under the controlled - comparison setting sketched above , we find that memorable quotes exhibit significant differences from non - memorable quotes in several fundamental respects , and these differences in the data reinforce the two main principles from the human pilot study .",
    "first , we show a concrete sense in which memorable quotes are indeed _ distinctive _ : with respect to lexical language models trained on the newswire portions of the brown corpus @xcite , memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their non - memorable counterparts .",
    "interestingly , this distinctiveness takes place at the level of words , but not at the level of other syntactic features : the part - of - speech composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely with respect to newswire .",
    "thus , we can think of memorable quotes as consisting , in an aggregate sense , of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part - of - speech patterns .",
    "we also identify a number of ways in which memorable quotes convey greater _",
    "generality_. in their patterns of verb tenses , personal pronouns , and determiners , memorable quotes are structured so as to be more `` free - standing , '' containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text .",
    "memorable quotes differ in other interesting aspects as well , such as sound distributions .",
    "our analysis of memorable movie quotes suggests a framework by which the memorability of text in a range of different domains could be investigated .",
    "we provide evidence that such cross - domain properties may hold , guided by one of our motivating applications in marketing .",
    "in particular , we analyze a corpus of advertising slogans , and we show that these slogans have significantly greater likelihood at both the word level and the part - of - speech level with respect to a language model trained on memorable movie quotes , compared to a corresponding language model trained on non - memorable movie quotes .",
    "this suggests that some of the principles underlying memorable text have the potential to apply across different areas .",
    "[ [ roadmap ] ] roadmap + + + + + + +     [ sec : pilot ] lays the empirical foundations of our work : the design and creation of our movie - quotes dataset , which we make publicly available (  [ sec : data ] ) , a pilot study with human subjects validating imdb - based memorability labels (  [ sec : human ] ) , and further study of incorporating search - engine counts (  [ sec : web ] ) . ",
    "[ sec : experiments ] details our analysis and prediction experiments , using both movie - quotes data and , as an exploration of cross - domain applicability , slogans data . ",
    "[ sec : relwork ] surveys related work across a variety of fields .  [ sec : conc ] briefly summarizes and indicates some future directions .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we also made some auxiliary observations that may be of interest .",
    "specifically , we find differences in letter and sound distribution ( e.g. , memorable quotes  after curse - word removal  use significantly more `` front sounds '' ( labials or front vowels such as represented by the letter _ i _ ) and significantly fewer `` back sounds '' such as the one represented by _",
    "u _ ) , word complexity ( e.g. , memorable quotes use words with significantly more syllables ) and phrase complexity ( e.g. , memorable quotes use fewer coordinating conjunctions ) .",
    "the latter two are in line with our distinctiveness hypothesis .",
    "how an item s linguistic form affects the reaction it generates has been studied in several contexts , including evaluations of product reviews @xcite , political speeches @xcite , on - line posts @xcite , scientific papers @xcite , and retweeting of twitter posts @xcite .",
    "we use a different set of features , abstracting the notions of distinctiveness and generality , in order to focus on these higher - level aspects of phrasing rather than on particular lower - level features .",
    "related to our interest in distinctiveness , work in advertising research has studied the effect of syntactic complexity on recognition and recall of slogans @xcite .",
    "there may also be connections to von restorff s _ isolation effect _ @xcite , which asserts that when all but one item in a list are similar in some way , memory for the different item is enhanced .",
    "related to our interest in generality , @xcite surveyed subjects regarding memorable messages or pieces of advice they had received , finding that the ability to be applied to multiple concrete situations was an important factor .",
    "memorability , although distinct from `` memorizability '' , relates to short- and long - term recall .",
    "@xcite survey sub - lexical , lexical , and semantic attributes affecting short - term memorability of lexical items .",
    "studies of verbatim recall have also considered the task of distinguishing an exact quote from close paraphrases @xcite .",
    "investigations of long - term recall have included studies of culturally significant passages of text @xcite and findings regarding the effect of rhetorical devices of alliterative @xcite , `` rhythmic , poetic , and thematic constraints '' @xcite",
    ".    finally , there are complex connections between humor and memory @xcite , which may lead to interactions with computational humor recognition @xcite .",
    "motivated by the broad question of what kinds of information achieve widespread public awareness , we studied the the effect of phrasing on a quote s memorability .",
    "a challenge is that quotes differ not only in how they are worded , but also in who said them and under what circumstances ; to deal with this difficulty , we constructed a controlled corpus of movie quotes in which lines deemed memorable are paired with non - memorablelines spoken by the same character at approximately the same point in the same movie . after controlling for context and situation ,",
    "memorable quotes were still found to exhibit , _ on average _",
    "( there will always be individual exceptions ) , significant differences from non - memorablequotes in several important respects , including measures capturing distinctiveness and generality .",
    "our experiments with slogans show how the principles we identify can extend to a different domain .",
    "future work may lead to applications in marketing , advertising and education @xcite .",
    "moreover , the subtle nature of memorability , and its connection to research in psychology , suggests a range of further research directions .",
    "we believe that the framework developed here can serve as the basis for further computational studies of the process by which information takes hold in the public consciousness , and the role that language effects play in this process .
