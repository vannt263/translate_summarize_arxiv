    ". however , standard @xmath3cdm cosmology fails to explain the homogeneity and isotropy of the observable universe , as well as the observed geometric flatness of the universe .",
    "inflation , an exponential expansion of space - time at the earliest epochs , resolves these issues and provides a mechanism to stretch primordial quantum fluctuations in the early universe to seed structure we observe today@xcite .",
    "the paradigm of inflation already enjoys circumstantial evidence , most prominently by the observation of a power law spectrum of perturbations and a measured departure from exact scale - invariance of perturbations@xcite .",
    "however , inflation models also generically predict a stochastic gravitational wave background generated by magnification of quantum perturbations of the gravitational field@xcite .",
    "the ratio of the amplitude of the tensor perturbations that generate primordial gravitational waves to the amplitude of scalar perturbations that seed structure is called ` @xmath4 ' , and is used to characterize inflationary models as well as the energy scale of inflation .",
    "primordial gravitational waves are expected to interact with the cosmic microwave background at the surface of last scattering and imprint a parity - odd linear polarization at degree angular scales@xcite . a detection of this primordial ` b",

    "however , a lack of sufficiently constraining spectral data from the /_keck _ collaboration or other publicly available datasets permits the high value of @xmath4 suggested by the fit to be lowered by an uncertain amount to accommodate galactic dust contamination .",

    "the feed network is designed to minimize beam pointing differences between the two polarizations for a pixel and uses gaussian - tapered illumination to suppress side lobes @xcite .",
    "the microwave power collected in a single polarization feed network is deposited on a gold absorber coupled to a tes bolometer . to control the bolometer conductance to the thermal bath ,",

    "the module housings are fabricated using niobium to provide a superconducting magnetic shield around the squids at operating temperatures .",
    "the detector - array modules present a significant simplification from the /  focal plane design ; detector - array tiles of those experiments were directly wire bonded to the focal plane and were challenging to modify or repair  a scheme nearly unviable for a focal plane with 20 detector - array tiles .",

    "the adc / dac for thermal monitoring and control was designed at the california institute of technology and stanford university .",
    "it was built at the university of minnesota , incorporating the blastbus2 data acquisition system@xcite from the university of toronto .",
    "similar to all /_keck _ experiments , s optical elements are housed inside the receiver cryostat and cooled to @xmath9k to minimize loading on the detectors . the telescope is a simple two - lens , diffraction - limited , on - axis telecentric refractor to keep aberration and distortions subdominant .",
    "it differs from its predecessors in that its clear aperture is twice as large and its detectors and optics have been sized and situated to enable faster images and greater optical throughput .",
    "this results in f - ratio @xmath1 compared to @xmath2 for /.",
    "the lenses are 580 mm in diameter and are made of the same type of alumina as the absorptive filter at 50k .",
    "the high refractive index of alumina ( @xmath10 at @xmath11 mm ) allows the lenses to be thinner than equivalent lenses of high - density polyethylene ( hdpe ) .",

    "the beams appear well behaved and beam concentricity of orthogonal polarizations was measured to be @xmath72% of the fwhm .",
    "additionally , we characterized the bandpass filters on the pixel antenna - summing trees using a martin - puplett fourier transform spectrometer ( fts)@xcite . a typical bandpass is shown in figure [ fig : qffbm ] .",
    "the large aperture alumina lenses have high index , and thus can have high reflectance . without a suitable anti - reflection coating ( arc ) , the  optical chain would have a total reflectance of up to @xmath13 .",

    "for we developed a custom epoxy mixture to provide the correct refractive index for maximum transmission , and also developed dicing techniques to achieve cryogenically stable arc for for large - area alumina lenses and filters .",
    "as an arc for our alumina optics we use a blend of stycast 1090 and stycast 2850 in a 3:2 ratio by volume , activated by catalyst 23lv .",
    "we measured this mixture to have an index @xmath15 at 95ghz when cured .",
    "for consistency between different arcs , the epoxy quantities are individually measured to 0.5% uncertainty in weight and mixed mechanically for a preset time .",
    "furthermore , the mixing is done under vacuum to facilitate outgassing and to prevent bubbles from forming inside the arc .",
    "we have established by index measurement that mixture separation is negligible during the epoxy set up time .",
    "the epoxy mixture is deposited on the surface to be coated , and rough molded to 1 mm thickness using a precision aluminum mold .",
    "once cured , the arc must be reduced to the correct thickness .",
    "this is 0.452 mm for maximum in - band transmission for the epoxy mixture we use on the  alumina optics . for a flat filter ,",
    "the required thickness is achieved by abrasive polishing to @xmath16 m uncertainty . for the lenses ,",
    "the arc is directly machined to @xmath17 m uncertainty with a diamond tool on a cnc end mill as shown in figure [ fig : arc ] . for reference ,",
    "a 25@xmath8 m systematic offset on 4 arc surfaces for the lenses represents a 1% reduction in transmission for our 95ghz band , compared to maximum of 98.2% for a perfect arc .",
    "the achieved accuracy for direct machining is made possible by characterizing the lens surfaces and features with a coordinate - measuring machine ( cmm ) to 2@xmath8m - uncertainty before arc deposition , and the establishment of a common coordinate system between the cmm and cnc to 5@xmath8 m uncertainty in the vertical direction and @xmath17 m in the plane perpendicular to the vertical .",
    "finally , the arc is diced into 1@xmath18 patches using a 355 nm uv laser with 30@xmath8 m spot size and depth of cut down to the alumina substrate , as shown in figure [ fig : arc ] .",

    "the observing patch of  can be additionally expanded by scanning between wider endpoints in azimuth relative to the /  observing strategy . by mapping a larger field ,",
    "will measure a larger number of multipole modes than / , and can therefore obtain a lower sample variance . although  observes at a larger wavelength , its optical design gives a slightly smaller beam size of @xmath725arcmin .",
    "this results in an improvement in resolution compared to the 30arcmin beams of /  at 150 ghz , and a more substantial improvement compared to the 43arcmin beams of the  receivers at 95ghz .",
    "although measurements of  performance on a cold cmb sky are not yet available , we can estimate its sensitivity from the 95ghz detectors .",
    "this gives a projected instantaneous sensitivity of @xmath21k@xmath22 for 1280 pixels .",
    "after two years of observation over the  patch , the  map depth at 95ghz will be approximately equal to the 150ghz map depth from the  at that time .",
