    "indeed , dla studies provided the first and ( still ) the most comprehensive view of the ism at high redshifts . to properly place this wealth of ism measurements within galaxy formation theories , however , it is critical to connect the gas to the stars and to the processes of star formation .",
    "establishing this connection directly by observing the stars and/or regions , however , has proven to be remarkably challenging .",
    "early works searched first for  emission , both in the core of the  absorption profile and with narrow - band imaging or , more recently , with integral field spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and mostly upper limits to the star - formation rates ( sfrs ) , @xmath20 , albeit subject to substantial systematic uncertainties related to dust depletion and   radiative transfer .",
    "the community then searched sensitively for far - uv continuum emission in broad - band imaging , applying the lyman - break technique when possible to pre - select candidates at high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these surveys were largely unsuccessful , with only a few positive detections .",
    "this implied inherently faint ultraviolet emission and/or that the absorbing galaxies were drowned out by the glare of the background quasar .",
    "more recently , @xcite introduced a novel technique to address the problem of detecting a faint dla close to a bright quasar , using a high-@xmath21 absorption system at a redshift close to that of the background quasar to `` block '' its far - ultraviolet light , thus allowing a sensitive search for emission from a second , lower - redshift dla along the sightline . unfortunately",

    "the images were first dark subtracted and flattened ; figure  [ fig : example]a shows an example of one processed frame . as is evident from the figure , the nifs lenslets project spectra onto the detector with different wavelength zeropoints . to begin sky subtraction , we first registered the sky lines by applying a rigid pixel offset to each row derived from a 1-d cross - correlation , after a @xmath25 re - sampling in the spectral dimension . because the @xmath25 re - sampled spectral pixels have a size of 1.03   , this rigid pixel offset does not introduce a wavelength error larger than @xmath26   .",
    "after the rows of spectra were aligned , a constant sky background was subtracted column by column ( figure  [ fig : example]b ) . at this stage , this simple sky - subtraction was sufficient to allow detection of the qsos over the entire spectral range , in each 560s exposure .",
    "the original nifs 2-d images have a spatial pixel size of @xmath27 and spectral pixel sizes of @xmath28   .",
    "the images were reformatted and re - sampled into 3-d cubes of @xmath29    pixel sizes .",
    "the cubes were collapsed along the spectral axes to form continuum images of the qsos ( figure  [ fig : images ] , top panels ) .",
    "centroids of the quasar emission were used to derive dither offsets for the multiple exposures with a precision that is much smaller than the pixel size .",
    "we also estimated the psf provided by the altair adaptive optics ( ao ) system to lie in the range @xmath30 ( full width at half maximum ; fwhm ) .    to sensitively search for the dla h@xmath0 emission ,",
    "one requires a much higher fidelity approach to sky subtraction and cosmic ray removal .",
    "figure  [ fig : example]b shows obvious residuals at the brightest sky lines and also `` ripples '' in the spatial dimension that we associate with spatial variations in the sky background and/or non - uniformities in the lenslets that have not been captured by the flat - fielding procedure .",
    "we also wished to search sensitively for  emission close to , or even at , the position of each qso .",
    "therefore , we fitted a 5th or 6th - order polynomial , column by column and then row - by - row , to each nifs 2d image and subtracted the fitted values .",
    "figure  [ fig : example]c shows a resultant image .",
    "this procedure is designed to remove slowly varying flux fluctuations related to the background and the qso without eliminating narrow features such as emission lines and cosmic rays . for the latter",
    ", we flagged all pixels with fluxes @xmath31 above the background and verified ( by eye ) that none of these could be consistent with an emission feature .",
    "lastly , we median - combined the five to ten dithered images without alignment to generate a final residual map of the sky background including the effects of `` hot '' pixels .",
    "this residual map was subtracted from each image ( e.g.  figure  [ fig : example]d ) and these images were reformatted to 3-d cubes .",
    "the dithered cubes of each target were then aligned and combined with sigma - clipping to form the final data cube for each field .",
    "the spectral images of the ar / xe arc lamps and the a0v stars were processed separately .",
    "sky - subtraction was not carried out here since the sources are much brighter than the structure in the sky background .",
    "the extracted ar / xe spectra were used to derive wavelength solutions , accurate to @xmath32    over the observed spectral ranges , which is sufficient for our science .",
    "the extracted a0v spectra were used to derive telluric absorptions and perform flux calibration .",
    "first , we masked the 2.166 @xmath33 m hydrogen absorption lines on the a0v spectra and interpolated over the masked regions in the continua .",
    "the spectra were then compared with the model spectrum of vega @xcite to derive the telluric absorptions as a function of wavelength .",
    "absorption corrections of @xmath34 were applied to both the data cubes of the targets and the a0v spectra .",

    "these are all much better than the natural seeing but worse than what altair can achieve in the best cases ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "both the qso and the sky were cleanly subtracted across the images , enabling the search for faint  emission even along the sightline to each qso .",

    "we found no evidence for emission in any of these cases . to search for very broad emission , we also created images averaged over 22 spectral pixels ( corresponding to @xmath40 km s@xmath8 , bottom row of figure  [ fig : images ] ) ; no emission was detected at this coarser resolution .",
    "for the discussion below , we will assume a line width of @xmath39  km  s@xmath8 , i.e. we will use the images of the middle row in fig .",

    "we conclude that the three dlas of our sample do not produce strong  emission within @xmath54  kpc of the qso sightline .",
    "we used the non - detections of  emission to estimate upper limits to the  flux from each dla .",
    "we measured the background flux fluctuations in the 300  km  s@xmath8 images shown in the middle row of figure  [ fig : images ] in @xmath6 square apertures across each image .",
    "the @xmath6 size is larger than the psf fwhm in all three images , and corresponds to 3.3  kpc at @xmath5 .",

    "the measured root - mean - square ( rms ) noise fluctuations in @xmath6 apertures are @xmath55  erg  s@xmath8  @xmath9 , @xmath56  erg  s@xmath8  @xmath9 , and @xmath57 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 , in the images for qso2343 + 125 , qso0201 + 365 , and qso0311 + 430 , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "the above values can be converted to limits on the sfr via the expression @xmath58",

    "as a result , the sensitivity to  line emission is somewhat worse than the typically quoted @xmath12 upper limits based on the above @xmath59 error estimates . in order to better understand the systematics arising from our observing and data analysis procedure , and to obtain reliable constraints on the sfrs",
    ", we created artificial line emitting sources in each of the raw images of our target sources and processed these images identically to the actual images .",
    "we assumed intrinsically extended emitters with various sizes of gaussians of up to @xmath65 fwhm .",
    "we then convolved the source images with the psf derived from the qso images .",
    "the sources were conservatively assumed to have flat velocity profiles over @xmath66   .",
    "( @xmath67  km  sec@xmath8 ) and were randomly placed in the raw images with a range of fluxes .",
    "we consider a simulated source as recovered if it passes our inspection and its flux is detected at @xmath68 significance .",
    "we found that we confidently recover the simulated sources in our reduction when the input flux is @xmath69 times larger than the formal rms noise .",
    "this is consistent with the above - mentioned 20%30% flux loss caused by the broad psf .",
    "we thus regard this as a @xmath12 confidence detection limit .",
    "note that this is true even when the simulated sources have very small impact parameters to the qso sightline , except for the case of qso2343 + 125 .",
    "qso2343 + 125 has broad emission lines in our observed spectral cube , making our quasar subtraction slightly poorer . in this case",
    ", we can only detect the simulated line source along the qso sightline when it has @xmath70 significance .",
    "we therefore conclude that our observations constrain the star formation rates to sfr  @xmath10  m@xmath11  yr@xmath8 at all impact parameters for the dlas toward qso0201 + 365 and qso0311 + 430 , and sfr  @xmath71  m@xmath11  yr@xmath8 at separations @xmath72 for the dla towards qso2343 + 125 , with a poorer limit of sfr  @xmath13  m@xmath11  yr@xmath8 close to the qso for the last system .",
    "we note that all of these limits ignore dust obscuration beyond the modest correction associated with the empirical relation of @xcite .",
    "our observations would thus underestimate the sfr limits in the case of modest amount of extinction , and would be insensitive to dusty star - forming regions , for which the  line emission might be highly obscured .",
    "the primary aim of searches for line emission from high-@xmath17 dlas is the direct identification of their galaxy counterparts , so as to estimate the typical size , mass and sfr of absorption - selected galaxies .",
    "non - detections of  emission only allow us to place limits on the sfr , assuming that the emission region of the dla host lies within the search area .",
    "in addition , however , there has been much recent interest in whether high-@xmath17 absorption - selected galaxies also have a mass - metallicity relation similar to that seen in high-@xmath17 emission - selected galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the existence of such a relation in dlas is suggested by the correlations found between dla metallicity and both the velocity width of low - ionization metal lines @xcite and the rest equivalent width of the @xmath731526 line @xcite .",
    "similarly , the anti - correlation detected between dla metallicity and gas spin temperature @xcite also supports such a mass - metallicity relation , as higher mass dlas are expected to have larger fractions of cold gas and hence , lower spin temperatures @xcite . to this end , even non - detections of  emission in high - metallicity dlas are of much interest , as these may argue against the existence of a mass - metallicity relation in dlas given the star - forming main sequence of @xmath74 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "before we consider the repercussions of our results , we briefly discuss other recent searches for line emission from high-@xmath17 dlas .",
    "there have been two broad strategies that have been successful in either detecting , or placing strong constraints on , , , or line emission .",
    "( 1 )  @xcite pioneered an approach based on using vlt x - shooter slit spectroscopy , covering a large wavelength range ( @xmath75    @xmath76 m ) to simultaneously search for a number of lines , and using 3  slit position angles centred on the qso location ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( 2 )  conversely , @xcite used ifu spectroscopy with the spectrograph for integral field observations in the near - infrared ( sinfoni ) onboard the vlt to search for redshifted  emission , similar to our approach ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fynbo et al .",
    "also targeted high - metallicity dlas at @xmath77 , while peroux et al . and bouche et al .",
    "targeted dlas , sub - dlas and strong absorbers of all metallicities , centred at two redshifts , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "there are pros and cons to the two literature approaches , as well as to our own approach .",
    "the x - shooter - based strategy of @xcite has the advantage that a number of lines are simultaneously targeted , implying fewer problems due to night sky lines and sky subtraction .",
    "also , the use of 3 slit angles reduces the likelihood that the dla might be missed by the slit . however , the likelihood of missing the dla increases with distance from the qso location ( as the slits are centred on the qso ) , implying a bias towards absorbers at low impact parameter , @xmath80 .",
    "the vlt - sinfoni ifu searches for  emission by @xcite and @xcite have the advantage of being sensitive to  emission from a relatively large area ( field of view @xmath81",
    "arcsec@xmath82 ) around the qso sightline .",
    "however , ao was used ( with nearby guide stars ) for only a few dlas and even these only yielded a seeing @xmath83 . the relatively poor seeing and",
    "the degradation in the signal - to - noise ratio at the qso location ( due to the higher background ) implies that the sensitivity of such searches is lower close to the qso .",
    "non - detections of  emission might hence arise at low impact parameters , @xmath84 ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the case of our own search",
    ", the use of ao implies excellent seeing and high sensitivity to  emission even at the qso location for two of the targets , and reasonable sensitivity for the third target .",
    "however , the relatively small nifs field of view implies that we are only sensitive to emission for impact parameters @xmath85  kpc .",
    "thus ,  emission from large disks ( of radius @xmath86  kpc ) , where the  absorption occurs in the outskirts of the galaxy while the  emission is dominated by the central region might be missed in our search .",
    "note that all three dlas of our sample have relatively low  column densities , @xmath87 , as might be expected in the outer regions of a galaxy .    moving to detections , and focusing on dlas at @xmath77 ( i.e. excluding low-@xmath17 dlas and absorbers without  estimates ) ,",
    "the x - shooter method has led to the detection of line emission from five high - metallicity dlas at @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "non - detections from this approach have so far not been reported .",
    "perhaps unsurprisingly , four of the five detections ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been at relatively low impact parameters , @xmath89 .    in the case of vlt - sinfoni ifu spectroscopy ,",
    "@xcite report only a single detection of  emission in 10 dlas and 2 sub - dlas at @xmath77 .",
    "further , even the sole dla of their sample with a detection of  emission ( at @xmath90 towards j2222@xmath910946 ) had earlier been detected in , and lines in x - shooter spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "we will here only consider the subset of 10 absorbers , 5 dlas and 5 sub - dlas , with  estimates .",
    "these yielded two detections of  emission , one system again being the ubiquitous @xmath90 dla towards j2222@xmath910946 .",
    "the sole other detection was in the @xmath97 dla towards he2243@xmath916031 , an intermediate metallicity absorber ( [ zn / h ]  @xmath98 ; @xcite ) , detected at a large impact parameter , @xmath99  kpc , with an sfr of @xmath100 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the seven non - detections yielded typical sfr limits of @xmath101 .",
    "finally , our own search in three dlas yielded no  detections , with strong sfr constraints of @xmath102 within a distance of 12.5  kpc to the qso sightline ( excepting the qso location in one field ) .",

    "specifically , combining our results with those of @xcite and @xcite , there has been only a single `` new '' detection of  emission , and a corresponding identification of a galaxy counterpart , and 21 non - detections from ifu searches .",
    "conversely , there have been five identifications of galaxy counterparts via the x - shooter slit spectroscopy approach @xcite .",
    "the target dla samples of the two types of searches have been very different , with the ifu searches mostly targeting low - metallicity dlas ( 18/22 ) and the x - shooter spectroscopy focusing on high - metallicity dlas .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , together with the observed sfr-@xmath104 main sequence .",
    "on the other hand , the three high - metallicity dlas of our sample were not detected in a sensitive ifu search .",
    "these have metallicities similar to those of three of the x - shooter targets in @xcite , and would have been detected in our search for similar sfrs ( @xmath105 ) and impact parameters ( @xmath106 kpc ) . adopting the sfr-@xmath104 relation of @xcite and extrapolating it to lower sfrs ,",
    "our limits imply @xmath107 .",
    "is such a low mass inconsistent with the dla metallicities ? evaluating the fmr of @xcite , which is based on emission lines , with @xmath108 and sfr  @xmath109 , we recover 12+log(o / h )  @xmath110dex .",
    "this value is roughly consistent with the dla absorption metallicity , especially given the systematic uncertainty of nebular - line metallicity measurements inherent to the fmr and the possibility of abundance gradients .",
    "of course , the number of high - metallicity dlas that have been searched for   or nebular emission is still quite small and it is possible that observational biases might have caused some of the non - detections .",
    "for example , in the model of @xcite , high - metallicity dlas are expected to arise in large , luminous galaxies , with statistically larger impact parameters .",
    "the  non - detections in our searches might then have been due to the limited nifs field of view .",
    "we conclude that , although the paucity of detections in ifu searches is certainly curious , all three approaches ( vlt - x - shooter , gemini - nifs and vlt - sinfoni ) have biases ( see above ) that would affect the fraction of detections of  or nebular emission , and hence the inferred sfr limits .",
    "we suggest that the present approaches should be augmented by ( 1 )  combining wide - field ifu searches with the use of ao with laser guide stars , so that  emission can not be hidden under the qso emission or missed by being outside the field of view , and ( 2 )  following up x - shooter non - detections with more slit angles , to rule out the possibility that non - detections arise because the nebular emission is not covered by the slit .",
