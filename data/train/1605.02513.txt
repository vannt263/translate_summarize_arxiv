    "this work has been performed in the frame of the realization of superconducting quantum circuits based on josephson junctions .",
    "these circuits can show quantized energy levels like an artificial atom .",
    "formally , a quantum bit is a two - state quantum mechanical system .",
    "the first two levels of such artificial atoms can be considered as quantum bits . in order to manipulate the quantum bit , we typically couple such an artificial atom to photons of a microwave resonator .    up to now ,",
    "most of the superconducting circuits are realized using aluminium .",
    "these films are polycrystalline .",
    "high density of crystal defects induces scattering processes for the charge carriers and limits the coherence time of the quantum bits @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why we are preparing our superconducting thin films by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "the rhenium has been chosen because the lattice mismatch between rhenium and sapphire [ 0001 ] is small ( about -0.47% at room temperature in the in - plane direction @xmath0 ) .",
    "the quality of the layer as well as the interface between sapphire and rhenium is very high @xcite .",
    "moreover , rhenium does not oxidise , leading to clean interfaces .",
    "this article presents the realization and the low temperature characterization of quarter wave ( @xmath1 ) resonators coupled to a transmission feedline made out of epitaxial rhenium films .",
    "the microwave characterization has allowed the determination of the london penetration depth for the first time to our knowledge .",

    "a scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) picture of a resonator coupled to a transmission feedline is shown in the figure 1 ( a ) .",
    "the resonator of length @xmath5 is formed of a center conductor of width @xmath6 separated from the lateral ground planes by a gap of width @xmath7 . the center conductor is shorted to the ground at one side and opened at the other",

    "the resonator is modelled as a transmission line . the capacitance per unit length @xmath8 , the characteristic impedance @xmath4 , the magnetic inductance per unit length @xmath9 and the kinetic inductance per unit length @xmath10 of a resonator are the physical parameters describing its properties .",
    "they depend on the geometrical dimension of the resonator and the physical properties of the material ( such as the effective permittivity of the substrate and the effective penetration depth of the superconducting layer)@xcite .",

    "three resonators per chip are coupled to the feedline .",
    "the length of the elbow part is small compared to the resonator length and the microwave wavelength at the resonance frequency .",
    "only the part where the electric field is predominant is coupled to the feedline .",
    "we can thus neglect the inductive coupling .",
    "the capacitive coupling is modelled by a single capacitor @xmath2 .",

    "the depth of the resonance dip and the full width at half maximum are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "measured resonance dips may have an asymmetric shape and not a lorentzian shape as shown in the figure 3 .",
    "such asymmetric shapes are attributed to an impedance mismatch between feedline and transmission line @xcite . to take into account this effect",
    ", we simply introduce two identical imaginary impedances @xmath32 as indicated in the figure 1 ( b ) .",

    "we assume a weak coupling : @xmath24 and @xmath35 . @xmath36 normalizes the transmission near the resonance through the factor @xmath37 .",
    "in addition @xmath36 plays a similar role than the @xmath22 in eq.[eq : s21-lorentz ] except that it is a complex number and determines the asymmetry as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "different samples of epitaxial rhenium have been fabricated .",
    "the growth conditions have been changed from sample to sample in order to find optimal parameters .",
    "the sapphire has been annealed at 1400  k in a 20%-oxygen and 80%-argon atmosphere to obtain atomically smooth surface of terrace and step like structure .",
    "rhenium is grown under ultra - high vacuum in order to avoid contamination .",
    "the typical deposition rate is 0.1  .s@xmath39 .",
    "an important parameter is the temperature of the substrate during the growth which ensures a good mobility of ad atoms on the substrate . at low temperature ( around 970  k ) , the surface is composed of grains as seen on the atomic force microscopy ( afm ) picture in the figure 2-top . the reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed )",
    "pattern indicates a 2d layer and 3d grains .",
    "the x - ray diffraction shows one large rhenium peak corresponding to the epitaxial orientation and an other smaller peak corresponding to a secondary orientation confirming that part of the surface is not epitaxial .",
    "the rhenium layer @xmath40 was 25  nm thick .",

    "we obtain @xmath42 = 160  nm and @xmath43 = 45  nm , respectively .",
    "the transition between superconductor and normal metal is unusual with a kind of two sub - transitions , the first one at about 1.85 k and the second one at 2.125  k.    for a growth at higher temperature ( 1 040 k ) , we can observe atomic steps and spirals on the surface using afm ( see on the figure 2-lower and inset ) .",
    "these spirals are thought to arise from screw dislocations .",

    "several microwave resonators based on the layers a and b have been characterized .",
    "the figure 3 shows the microwave transmission measurements of these .",
    "they were performed in high power limit but still inside the linear response of the resonator .",
    "we observe dips , each of them corresponding to one microwave resonator .",
    "the measured transmission coefficient has been fitted by the expression given in equation [ eq : s21-as ] .",
    "the data are displayed in blue points and the model is plotted in dashed red .",
    "our model contains four independent parameters , namely the internal quality factor @xmath21 , the resonance frequency @xmath45 , and the complex coupling factor @xmath36 .",
    "these extracted parameters are listed in the caption of the figure [ fig : multiplexing ]      from the resonance at the lowest temperature , the kinetic inductance and consequently the penetration depth can be extracted using eq .",
    "indeed , the geometric inductance and capacitance per unit length for a coplanar waveguide geometry are given by ref.@xcite : @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . from eq .",

    ", we performed an ads simulation of our circuit .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath9 and @xmath8 are in good agreement with the extracted ones with a discrepancy less than 2% . from the quality factor obtained by the simulation considering zero losses ,",
    "the coupling capacitance can be estimated : @xmath52 .",
    "this coupling capacitance introduces an error in the extraction of @xmath53 due to the frequency shift of the resonance frequency .",
    "thus , the total error on the @xmath53 extraction is estimated to be smaller than 5% .",
    "the kinetic inductance of a thin film ( @xmath54 ) can be written as @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the thickness and @xmath57 the effective penetration depth .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 , which allows the calculation of the kinetic inductance for a coplanar waveguide geometry , is defined as follow @xcite : @xmath59 ,   \\label{oup}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with the width @xmath60 . from eq .",
    "[ eq : lkk ] and [ oup ] , the effective penetration depth is deduced : @xmath61 .",
    "since the rhenium film a is poorly epitaxial , the superconductivity is in the so - called _ dirty _ limit .",
    "the london penetration depth is related to the effective penetration depth as @xcite : @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "then we obtain : @xmath64 .",
    "the penetration depth extraction has been obtained within a 5% error using sample a. this is due to the thin thickness of the layer and its relative large @xmath65 which produces a kinetic inductance of the order of the geometric inductance .",
    "this method could not be applied on layer b resonator whose kinetic inductance is estimated to be 10 times smaller and leading to a too large error .    hereafter we discuss an alternative method to extract the kinetic inductance .",
    "this is based on the temperature dependence of the resonance . in order to observe the effect of the temperature",
    ", we perform a series of resonance line shape measurements for the three resonators of sample a from 60  mk to 560  mk .",
    "the line shapes of the three resonances exhibit the same behaviour with a shift to smaller frequency and a reduction of the dip depth when the temperature increases .",
    "the relative frequencies squared @xmath66 versus temperature is shown in the figure 4 for the three resonators . from equation [ nu ] , we calculate the relative resonance frequency squared as : @xmath67 assuming gorter casimir law , the temperature dependence of the kinetic inductance is given by : @xmath68 leading to the relative resonance frequency temperature dependence : @xmath69 with @xmath70 the fraction of kinetic inductance .",
    "data shown in the figure [ fig : re - temperature ] are very well fitted by this equation with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . however , due to the small dependence of the resonance frequency in this experiment , the uncertainty on the fit parameters are very large .",
    "indeed a broad range of parameters @xmath73 can fit the data .",
    "this is explained by the low temperature range of the experiment , where frequency changes by only 1% .",
    "such uncertainty can be strongly reduced by measuring @xmath74 .",
    "however , we were not able to extract @xmath74 due to the double superconducting transition . in the future",
    "this method may be strongly improved in precision by measuring @xmath74 by transport measurement and by increasing the temperature range of the measurements .     versus temperature for the three resonators ( blue , red and green points ) .",
    "the dashed black and red curves are calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : relative - frequency ] with @xmath75 , @xmath74 = 1.9  k and @xmath76 , @xmath74 = 1.6  k , respectively .",
    "we remark that in this range of temperature , the two theoretical curves are indistinguishable.,width=307 ]      the extracted internal quality factors for sample a and b are about @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "they present very close values and seems independent of the crystallographic quality suggesting that the limiting factor is not the density of defects .",
    "moreover our measured q factors are one order of magnitude lower than state of the art q factors on epitaxial rhenium @xcite . in these reported measurements",
    ", the sample was placed inside a cylindrical cavity made of copper with 15  ghz cut - frequency .",
    "metglas ribbon wraps the sample holder but no blackbody absorber was used in the present measurements .",
    "we are currently improving the radiation shielding as well as the magnetic screening to reduce losses due to vortex motion and quasiparticles in order to improve the quality factor measurements @xcite .",
    "we have fabricated microwave resonators from an epitaxial layer of rhenium onto sapphire substrate .",
    "we succeed to realize state of the art epitaxial rhenium films with a rrr of 40 .",
    "this was obtained when the deposition temperature is about 1,040  k. by measuring the resonance frequency of a lower quality layer deposited at 970  k , the kinetic inductance was large enough to be extracted with precision . the effective penetration depth and the london penetration depth",
    "have been deduced .",
