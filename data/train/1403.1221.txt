    "ultra - cold dilute atomic gases are ideal laboratories for the realization of quantum emulators @xcite , i.e. for the creation of controllable devices that can simulate other systems of interest . at low temperatures atoms behave like point particles but their internal structure allows for the flexible manipulation of the effective particle interactions and the preparation of external potentials whose shape can be chosen nearly at will @xcite .",
    "atoms are charge neutral and seem not suitable to simulate the orbital magnetism . however , it is possible to create artificial magnetic fields , i.e. to prepare specific conditions where the motion of neutral particles mimics the dynamics of charged particles in an effective magnetic field @xcite .",
    "owning to the internal structure of atoms it is also possible to simulate non - abelian gauge fields @xcite .",
    "they emerge when the centre of mass motion of an atom is coupled to internal atomic degrees of freedom .",
    "atomic gases in optical lattice potentials can simulate lattice gauge fields .",
    "the latter arise , e.g. , in quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics when configuration space is discretized @xcite .",
    "lattice models describe also crystalline materials in condensed - matter physics .",
    "quantum emulators with ultra - cold atomic gases open possibilities for deep understanding of fundamental problems like quark confinement , high - temperature superconductivity or strongly interacting counterparts of topological insulators @xcite .",
    "although the ultimate goal is to realize a quantum simulator of dynamical non - abelian fields , the first step is to implement static field configurations .",
    "there are various proposal for the creation of non - abelian static gauge potentials for atomic gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "some of them involve lattice shaking or light assistant tunneling but all of them try to couple the centre of mass motion of an atom with an atomic internal structure ,    i.e. they employ multi - component gases @xcite ( see also the recent proposal for the realization of a spin - orbit coupling via photon - assistant band hybridization @xcite ) . in the present letter we show that the centre of mass degree of freedom is sufficient to model static non - abelian gauge fields if tunneling amplitudes in an optical lattice are engineered appropriately . in the paper we focus on the model with a constant wilson loop over a square plaquette .",
    "a single component atomic gas in an optical lattice can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bosonic or fermionic field operator that annihilates an atom at @xmath4-site of the lattice and @xmath5 s stand for tunneling amplitudes between the sites @xcite .",
    "we omit atom interactions and assume that tunneling of an atom from a given site is not restricted to the nearest neighbors .",
    "the lattice geometry can be arbitrary , i.e. it can form a simple bravais lattice or a crystal structure with a @xmath0-point basis .",
    "an example of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) squared bravais lattice with a two - point basis is shown in fig .",
    "[ dimers](a ) .",
    "let us identify a position of an atom in different points of the basis with different internal states of a _ particle _ located at a given site of the bravais lattice .",
    "that is , we define @xmath0-component operators @xmath6 built of the @xmath7 operators that correspond to different points of the basis of the same bravais lattice sites .",
    "then , we ask the question if the hamiltonian of a system can be written in the form [ hamiltonian ] h= - _ i , j ( t_ij _ i^ u_ij_j + h.c . ) , where real @xmath8 and the tunnelings of a _ particle _ between the bravais lattice sites is described by unitary link operators @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out it is possible and the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can simulate non - abelian gauge fields provided the tunneling amplitudes of atoms , @xmath5 , fulfill the specific conditions .    in our approach ,",
    "an optical lattice structure itself induces non - abelian behaviour .",
    "the multicomponent field operators @xmath6 can be defined if one creates an optical lattice corresponding to a bravais lattice with a basis like , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ dimers](a ) .",
    "however , a _ particle _ described by @xmath6 does not necessary need to be spatially well separated from the others , and easily identifiable in the lattice .",
    "_ particles _ may be assigned arbitrary at one s convenience even if an optical lattice is a simple bravais lattice , see fig .  [ dimers](b ) .",
    "the main difficulty is to ensure the unitarity of the transition matrices @xmath9 what can be overcome due to the great flexibility and sophistication in optical lattice engineering @xcite .",
    "our method is flexible in the manipulation of particle interactions because it does not involve explicitly internal atomic structure .",
    "for example , in order to simulate the integer quantum hall effect there is no need to turn off the particle interactions because a single component fermi gas does not interact at low temperatures .",
    "the method allows one to easily incorporate a _",
    "particle s _ mass term in a lattice gauge hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this can be done by introducing the tunnelings between lattice sites corresponding to the different components of @xmath6 .",
    "it results in an extra term @xmath10 in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , where @xmath11 is a matrix that describes masses of the _ particle _ components .",
    "as a concrete example let us show how to realize experimentally the u(2 ) non - abelian gauge field on the 2d squared bravais lattice with @xmath12 where [ hamiltonian_spec ] h_0= - _ m , n ( t_x_m+1,n^ u_x _ m , n + t_y_m , n+1^ u_y _ m , n + h.c . ) , and @xmath13 .",
    "the mass term can be also interpreted as the presence of a zeeman field experienced by a _ particle _ with a psuedospin .",
    "the bravais lattice points are @xmath14 and the link operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the matrix valued vector potential a_x=_2 , a_y(m , n)=_3 - 2(m_x+n_y ) , [ vect_pot ] where @xmath17 are the pauli matrices and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real parameters . the two - dimensional optical lattices presented in fig .  [ dimers](a)-(b )",
    "are examples which allow for the realization of such a gauge field . in fig .",
    "[ dimers](c)-(d ) there are indicated hoppings whose tunneling amplitudes must be controlled . this control seems to be easier experimentally if we consider the 2d bravais lattice with the basis whose points are displaced along the @xmath22 direction , e.g. , by the bravais lattice constant @xmath23 , see fig .",
    "[ dimers](e ) .",
    "the different points of the basis , @xmath24 , are identified with the internal states of a _ particle _ located at @xmath25 which we will call a _ dimer_.    to start with , we construct a 3d lattice potential @xmath26 , out of four non - interfering standing waves with an additional trapping potential , @xmath27 , that selects out the pairs of sites corresponding to the _ dimer _ components , i.e. @xmath28 , where    @xmath29 + \\cos\\left[k(x - z)\\right ]    + \\lambda \\cos\\left(k z\\right)\\right\\ } ,   \\label{lattice_potential}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    and @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "[ realizacja ] .",
    "the potential @xmath26 does not couple the @xmath35 and @xmath22 variables and consequently there is no mixing of the _ dimer _ components when the _ dimer _ tunnels along the @xmath35 direction , i.e. the link operator @xmath36 is diagonal as in ( [ vect_pot ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the complex phases in @xmath36 can be realized using laser - assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "the laser - assisted tunneling technique requires a potential energy gradient provided by the gravity or magnetic field gradients , and two running - wave beams with a difference @xmath37 of the wave - vectors .",
    "the frequency difference @xmath38 of the running beams matches the energy difference , between the neighboring sites , corresponding to the potential energy gradient .",
    "it results in an extra term @xmath39 in the potential @xmath26 .",
    "the phase an atom acquires when it tunnels along the @xmath35 direction is position dependent , i.e. it equals @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the position of an atom .",
    "finally , in order to control the transitions in accordance with @xmath42 we invoke the periodic lattice shaking @xcite .",
    "the lattice shaking demands an additional term , @xmath43 \\sin \\omega t$ ] , in the potential @xmath26 where @xmath38 is the shaking frequency ( which we assume the same as the frequency difference of the running beams in the laser assisted tunneling technique ) and @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the shaking strengths .",
    "if @xmath46 is greater than the bare atomic hopping amplitudes but smaller than the energy gap between the lowest and first excited energy bands of the optical lattice , the evolution can be time averaged @xcite .",
    "the averaging procedure comes down to the renormalization of the atomic hopping amplitudes . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath44 , @xmath45 and their difference are much larger than @xmath47 .",
    "then , the influence of the running waves on the renormalization of the tunneling amplitudes along the @xmath48 and @xmath22 directions is very small and can be neglected . due to the symmetries of @xmath26 ,",
    "there are only two parameters that describe the hoppings of atoms along the @xmath48 direction , i.e. @xmath49 are described by the bare amplitude which we denote by @xmath50 and @xmath51 by @xmath52 , cf .",
    "[ realizacja ] .",
    "the corresponding terms of the hamiltonian can be represented as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the shaking partially breaks that symmetry and hence the effective hoppings are t_xu_x= (    cc j_0^ & j_1^ + j_1^  & j_0^    ) , with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for the bessel function @xcite .",
    "our goal to achieve the unitarity of the @xmath42 operator can be reached by a proper choice of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath38 . if we set @xmath60 and define @xmath61 , then @xmath62 where @xmath63",
    "is given in ( [ vect_pot ] ) with @xmath64 .",
    "the shaking of the lattice allows also for the controlling of effective masses of the _ dimer _ components which are represented by the matrix @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the bare amplitude of atom tunneling between @xmath41 and @xmath67 .    finally let us consider examples of experimentally attainable parameters .",
    "the bare tunneling amplitudes can be calculated by fourier transform of the dispersion relation of the lowest energy band of an atom in the potential @xmath68 .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the recoil energy , we get @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in our model",
    "there are two angles @xmath18 and @xmath19 which determine the non - abelian behaviour , see ( [ vect_pot ] ) .",
    "the angle @xmath75 can be set nearly arbitrary by a suitable choice of the direction of the vector @xmath37 while the value of @xmath18 depends on the shaking parameters .",
    "for example , for @xmath76 and @xmath77 one gets @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "then , and for @xmath81 , the wilson loop @xmath82 , see sec .",
    "[ thc ] . in order to get @xmath83 very close to zero",
    ", we need @xmath84 that can be achieved , for example , for @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "the effective tunneling along the @xmath35 direction j_y^=j_y_1e^i [ 2(_x m + _ y n ) ] , depends on the amplitude @xmath47 of the running beams and on the bare tunneling amplitude @xmath87 . for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "we obtain @xmath91 .",
    "note that the assumed condition @xmath92 is also fulfilled .",
    "let us switch to an analysis of the model described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_spec ] ) supplemented with the mass term . in the letter we focus on the effects induced by the non - zero masses of the components , whereas the detailed analysis of massless non - abelian model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following we assume @xmath93 .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under any local u(2 ) gauge transformation , i.e. @xmath94 , @xmath95 and similarly for @xmath36 , where @xmath96 . in order to distinguish between the different classes of gauge fields",
    "it is useful to define the wilson loop over a square oriented plaquette of neighboring sites , @xmath97 , which is a gauge invariant quantity @xcite .",
    "although a single link operator , @xmath42 or @xmath36 , can always be transformed to the identity by the gauge transformation , a product of link operators over a closed loop can not be trivialized when a gauge field is genuinely non - abelian .",
    "hence , our system is non - abelian if and only if @xmath98 .",
    "it is known that the condition @xmath99 \\ne 0 $ ] is not sufficient to reach the non - abelian regime @xcite . however ,",
    "if @xmath42 and @xmath36 do not commute and anti - commute , @xmath100 , one can show that the gauge theory is genuinely non - abelian , see appendix a for a general u@xmath1 case .    although the presence of the abelian phase @xmath20 in ( [ vect_pot ] ) , does not modify the modulus of the wilson loop , it induces a uniform abelian magnetic field @xmath101 and breaks the spatial periodicity of the system .",
    "the other abelian phase @xmath21 can be eliminated by the gauge transformation and therefore we set @xmath102 . the periodicity is restored when the phase @xmath20 is a rational number , i.e. @xmath103 with @xmath104 , @xmath105 being integers .",
    "then , the bloch theorem guarantees that solutions of the time - independent schrodinger equation are of the form @xmath106 , where @xmath107 $ ] is a periodic function of @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "after the substitution the schrodinger equation reduces to a generalized harper equation and therefore we should expect a spectrum of the hofstadter butterfly type @xcite .",
    "indeed , the characteristic fractal structure of the energy levels plotted against the abelian flux @xmath20 for the mass term @xmath109 is shown in fig .",
    "[ motyle ] .",
    "the fractal structure depends on the non - abelian phases @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "what is more , the spectrum gets modified when the _ particle _ components acquire mass .",
    "firstly , the reflection symmetry of the spectrum with respect to @xmath110 is broken . secondly , with increasing @xmath111 ,",
    "large energy gaps are formed and the spectrum starts to spread and eventually separates into two parts , see fig .",
    "[ motyle ] .",
    "a topological insulator is characterized by a bulk energy gap like ordinary insulators . however , the finite system possesses conducting states which are gapless states on the edge and which are deeply related to the topology of bulk states @xcite . indeed , the topological invariants , chern numbers , determine the transverse hall conductivity .",
    "let us consider the ground state of non - interacting fermions corresponding to the fermi energy @xmath112 .",
    "we denote with @xmath113 a @xmath114-th energy band and @xmath115 a non - degenerate eigenstate of @xmath116 .",
    "the energy bands @xmath117 are smooth functions in the brillouin zone .",

    "the chern numbers , @xmath120 , are integer - valued topological invariants which fully determine the transverse hall conductivity , @xmath121 , where the summation runs over all the @xmath114 energy bands below the fermi energy @xmath112 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ conductivity ] we present examples of @xmath122 .",
    "importantly , the non - zero mass is responsible for the formation of large energy gaps corresponding to @xmath123 , which can be very important in the experimental detection of the quantization of the hall conductivity . different proposals of experimental detection of the hall conductivity and topological invariants in cold atom systems are currently under investigation , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that a single component ultra - cold atomic gas in an appropriately engineered optical lattice potential can simulate non - abelian lattice gauge fields .",

    "our idea is a novel route to the realization of quantum emulators of non - abelian gauge fields in ultra - cold atomic gases .",
    "it has advantages over more common proposals where internal atomic states are coupled to the centre of mass motion of an atom . for example , the manipulation of the particle interactions is more flexible because the internal structure of an atom is not explicitly involved in our proposal .",
    "finally , the massive components greatly modify the hofstadter - like energy spectrum , creating the large energy gaps with the non - zero transverse hall conductivity .",
    "we have considered mapping between a system of a spinless particle in an optical lattice potential and a system of a _ particle _ with a pseudo - spin degree of freedom but in a simpler lattice .",
    "if such a mapping is possible , a theoretical description of the translational motion of the spinless particle possesses simpler interpretation .",
