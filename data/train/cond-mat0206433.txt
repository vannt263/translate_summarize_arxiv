    "recently , pushed by the need to fit the available experimental data on a large variety of networks , statistical physics is addressing its attention to complex networks@xcite and in particular to scale - free networks characterized by power - law connectivity distribution .",
    "the topological properties of these networks are related to their dynamic evolution and play a key role in collective phenomena of complex systems@xcite .",
    "consequently there is an urgent need of a general formalism able to make a distinction between networks .",
    "different approaches have already been proposed for equilibrium graphs@xcite .    in this paper we will restrict our study to inhomogeneous growing networks with different quality of nodes , described by quantum statistics .",
    "in fact we have recently presented a growing scale - free network with different qualities of the nodes and a thermal noise that is described by bose statistics@xcite . on the other hand",
    "we have found that a growing cayley - tree with different qualities of the nodes and a thermal noise is described by fermi statistics@xcite . in order to be synthetic in the following",
    "we will refer to these two networks as the bosonic and the fermionic networks respectively .",
    "given the fact that the solution of the dichotomy between bose and fermi statistics is an attractive topic discussed in many different contexts , from supersymmetry@xcite to quantum algebras @xcite , in the first part of the paper we compare the growth dynamics of the two networks .",
    "we find that the bosonic and fermionic network are obtained by continuous subsequent addition of an elementary fan - shaped unit attached in two opposite directions . while the appearance of a classical system described by quantum statistics is not completely new@xcite this is the first example of the occurrence of two symmetrically constructed models following bose and fermi statistics respectively .",
    "always having in mind the general problem of the bose - fermi dichotomy , in the second part of this work we provide a more realistic example of network in which the two growth processes coexist .",
    "this is obtained by rewiring a bosonic network .",
    "this complex inhomogeneous system has two classes of nodes with increasing and decreasing connectivity and is fully described by a mixed statistic depending on two chemical potentials ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the bosonic network @xcite is a scale - free network in which each node has an intrinsic quality @xmath5 from a time independent distribution @xmath6 . at each timestep",
    "a new node is added to the network attaching @xmath7 links preferentially to more connected low energy nodes .",
    "the probability @xmath8 that a new link is attached to a node of energy @xmath9 and connectivity @xmath10 is given by _",
    "[ uno]the fermionic network @xcite is a growing cayley tree of coordination number @xmath11 in which nodes have an intrinsic quality @xmath5 from a time independent distribution @xmath6 .",
    "nodes are distinguished between nodes at the interface ( with connectivity one ) and nodes in the bulk ( with connectivity @xmath11 ) . at each time",
    "step a node at the interface can grow giving rise to @xmath7 new nodes .",
    "the probability that a node @xmath12 grows is given by the probability @xmath13 that the node is at the interface ( its survivability ) , times @xmath14 _ i^fe^_i _ i. [ due ] the dynamic of the two networks is parameterized by @xmath15 that is a characteristic of the network growth and plays the role of the inverse temperature , i.e. @xmath16 . for @xmath17 the dynamics became extremal and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are different form zero only for the lowest and the highest energy node of the network respectively .",
    "as the temperature increases , the dynamic involves also the other nodes and in the @xmath20 limit @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not depend anymore on the energy of the nodes .",
    "a generic bosonic network following @xmath21 and a generic fermionic network following @xmath22 can be constructed by attaching a fixed elementary unit to a number of nodes growing linearly with the size of the network @xmath23 .",
    "the fixed elementary unit playing the role of the unitary cell in crystal lattices , is a fan - shaped element constituted by a vertex node connected to @xmath7 other nodes .",
    "but the way in which this unit is attached is symmetric in the two networks . in the bosonic network",
    "the vertex of the fan is a new node attached by @xmath7 links to @xmath7 of the @xmath23 existing nodes of the network . on the contrary , in the fermionic network",
    "the elementary unit is reversed and the vertex is one of the @xmath24 nodes at the interface while the @xmath7 nodes attached to it are new nodes of the network .",
    "consequently both networks are constructed by the addition of the same elementary unit attached in the two opposite directions .",
    "the mean - field equation for the bosonic and fermionic network describe respectively the evolution of the connectivity @xmath10 and the survivability @xmath13 of the nodes . in the bosonic network , since every new link is attached to node @xmath12 with probability @xmath21 , and @xmath7 new link are attached at each timestep , the mean field equation for the connectivity @xmath10 is given by = m [ ki]where @xmath25 is the normalization sum of the probability @xmath18 , eq .",
    "symmetrically , in a fermionic network every node grows with probability @xmath19 given by @xmath22 .",
    "consequently the probability @xmath26 that a node @xmath12 is at the interface decreases in time following the mean field equation = - [ rhoi]where the denominator sum is needed in order to normalize the probability @xmath19 . in both networks",
    "the resulting structure optimizes the system by minimizing the free energy of each node of the network @xmath27 ( bosonic network ) or @xmath28 ( fermionic network ) . in the two networks",
    "this optimization is achieved in different ways . in the bosonic network",
    "the low - energy nodes are more likely to be awarded a new link while in the fermionic network high - energy nodes are more likely to be removed from the interface .",
    "while geometrically the two networks are related by the reversal of the elementary unit , the mean field equations ( [ ki ] ) and @xmath29 ) , in the case @xmath30 , are symmetric under time reversal ( @xmath31 ) and the change of sign of the energies ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "self - consistent calculations @xmath33 show that the connectivity @xmath34 ( the survivability @xmath35 ) ) of a node of energy @xmath5 added to the network at time @xmath36 , follows a power - law in time with an exponent dependent on its energy , k(t,|,t)=m()^f_b ( ) & & f_b()=e^-(-_b ) , + ( t,|,t)=  ( ) ^f_f ( ) & & f_f()=e^(-_f ) .",
    "[ power]the time reversal of the two mean - field solution implies here that the connectivity of the nodes always increases in time in the bosonic networks while the survivability of the nodes always decreases in time in the fermionic network .",
    "the dynamic described by @xmath37 ) depends on the two constant @xmath3 and @xmath4 given , respectively , by the solutions of the two equations 1&=&=dp ( ) n_b ( ) , + 1-&=&=dp ( ) n_f ( ) , [ mu]where @xmath38 indicates the bosonic and fermionic occupation numbers respectively .",
    "thus the evolution of each node of the network is completely determined by a number , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , defined as the chemical potentials of a bosonic or fermionic system with specific volumes @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the quantum occupation numbers @xmath41 and @xmath42 appears spontaneously in the solution of the mean - field equations @xmath43 and ( @xmath44 ) and assume a clear meaning when we look at the static picture of the networks .",
    "in fact , in the bosonic network the total number of links attached to nodes with energy @xmath5 , @xmath45 is given by n_b()=m t p()[1+n_b ( ) ] .",
    "[ nbs]in the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "@xmath46 the first and second terms represent the number of outgoing and incoming links connected to nodes of energy @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , in the fermionic network , the total number of nodes with energy @xmath5 found below the interface , @xmath47 is given by the difference between all the nodes of the network and those that are at the interface , i.e. n_f()=m t p()[1-n_f ( ) ] .",
    "[ nfs ]    nevertheless @xmath41 and @xmath42 acquire also a very specific role in the single time evolution of the network .",
    "in fact , at time @xmath48 , the probability @xmath49 of attaching a new link to a generic node of energy @xmath5 ( bosonic network ) and the probability @xmath50 that a generic node with energy @xmath5 will grow in the fermionic network , are given by _",
    "b^(t)()&=_1^t dt ( -_t ) & p ( ) n_b ( ) + _ f^(t)()&=_1^t dt ( -_t ) & p ( ) [ 1-n_f ( ) ] .",
    "these results explain the interconnection between the dynamic of the networks and their self - similar aspect .",
    "in fact , for the bosonic network we have that the probability for a new node to be linked to a node with energy @xmath5 converges in time to the same limit as the density of existing links pointing to nodes of energy @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , for the fermionic network we have that the probability that a node with energy @xmath5 is chosen to grow converge to the same limit than the density of nodes in the bulk .",
    "the occurrence of the two quantum statistics in the description of such networks is due to the fact that the networks are growing by the continuous addiction of the unitary cell but they try also to minimize the energy of the system ( by the choice of the node to which attach a new link in the bosonic network or by the choice of the growing node in the fermionic network ) .",
    "the stochastic model behind the construction of the two networks always involves the choice of a node in between a growing number of nodes , but while in the cayley tree a chosen node is removed from the interface and can not be chosen any more , in a scale - free networks there is no limit to the number of links a node can acquire .",
    "consequently the cayley tree is described by a fermi distribution while the scale - free network is described by a bose distribution .",
    "the framework of quantum statistics clarify the relation between self - organized critical processes and scale - free models .",
    "in fact , the fermionic network evolution in the @xmath51 limit reduces to the invasion percolation dynamics on a cayley tree@xcite , a well known self - organized process@xcite while the bosonic network in the @xmath52 limit reduces to the ba model@xcite for growing scale - free networks .",
    "our purpose here is to expand on the previous results and to discuss systems which are governed by additional processes on top of the simple growth discussed before .",
    "for example , in real networks , in addition of the appearance of new nodes , one can observe new links as well , or rewiring of existing links .",
    "in fact rewiring of the link in a scale - free network has been used to model increasing disorder in more realistic networks @xcite .",
    "we show that the presence of such additional processes can create a coexistence of fermi and bose statistics within the same system .",
    "this implies that most real systems , for which such additional processes are present , exist in a mixed state , whose statistics can be described only by simultaneously involving both bose and fermi statistics .",
    "it is not our purpose to model any particular system at this point .",
    "thus next we discuss a simple system that displays this mixed behavior .",
    "a simple example of mixed statistics is given by introducing rewiring into a bosonic network .",
    "this network is constructed iteratively in the following way : at each timestep a new node and @xmath7 links are added to the network .",
    "the new node has an energy @xmath5 chosen from a distribution @xmath6 and the @xmath7 links connect the new node preferentially to well connected , low energy nodes of the system . as in the bosonic network without rewiring",
    "we assume that a new links is attached with probability ^+_ie^-_ik(t|_i , t_i ) to node @xmath12 arrived in the network at time @xmath53 , with energy @xmath9 and connectivity @xmath54 at time @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore we assume also that at each timestep @xmath55 edges detach from existing nodes and are rewired to the new node .",
    "consequently every new node will have @xmath56 links attached to it .",
    "we assume that edges connected to high energy nodes are more unstable , so that the probability that an edge connected to a node of energy @xmath9 detaches from it is proportional to @xmath57",
    ". consequently , the probability that a node @xmath12 will loose a link because of the rewiring is given by ^-_ie^_ik(t|_i , t_i ) where @xmath53 is the time node @xmath12 is added in the network , @xmath9 is its energy and @xmath54 its connectivity at time @xmath48 .",
    "the continuous equation describing the time evolution of the connectivities of the nodes is given by = m - m [ dyn.eq ] with the initial condition k_0=k(t|_i , t)=m+m. [ in.eq]to solve @xmath58 we assume that in the thermodynamic limit the normalization sums @xmath59 and @xmath60 , given by z_b&=&_j e^-_jk(t|_j , t_j ) + z_f&=&_j e^_jk(t|_j , t_j ) selfaverage and converge to their mean value @xmath61 and grow linearly in time , with the asymptotic behavior given by the constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath62 , z_b_&&mt e^-_b + z_f_&&mt e^_f .",
    "[ limit.eq ] using @xmath63 , the dynamic equation @xmath58 reduces to = ( e^-(_i-_b)- e^(_i-_f ) ) .",
    "consequently we have found that the time evolution of the connectivity @xmath54 follows a power - law k(t|,t)=k_0()^f_mix ( ) [ kt.eq ] with f_mix()=e^-(-_b)-e^(-_b ) .",
    "[ f.eq ]    the characteristic difference of this network from the bosonic scale - free network is that the connectivity of the nodes , due to the rewiring process , can either increase or decrease in time .",
    "in fact @xmath64 ( defined in eq . ( @xmath65 ) ) change sign at a threshold energy value _",
    "s=. consequently the nodes with energy @xmath66 increase their connectivity in time while nodes with energy higher then the threshold @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath67 , have a decreasing connectivity .",
    "after substituting @xmath54 form eq .",
    "@xmath68 with @xmath64 given by @xmath69 into @xmath58 and the sum over @xmath70 with an integral , we get the self - consistent equations for the chemical potential @xmath3 and @xmath4 & = & dp ( ) + & = & dp ( ) .",
    "[ rew.fmix ]    = 3.5 in    on the same time , the distribution of edges attached to nodes with energy @xmath5 converges to the mixed statistics n_mix()p()=(m+m)p ( ) while the number @xmath71 of the edges stochastically attached to the nodes of energy @xmath5 or the number @xmath72 of the nodes detached from nodes with energy @xmath5 are given by n_+()p()&= & m p ( ) , + n_-()p()&= & m p ( ) respectively .",
    "the distribution @xmath73 appears as a natural candidate of a mixed statistics going from the @xmath74 limit where @xmath75 to the @xmath76 limit where @xmath77 .",
    "we have simulated a network with @xmath78 and @xmath79 and uniform energy distribution @xmath80 for @xmath81 , with chemical potentials @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in fig .",
    "@xmath85 we show the connectivity of the nodes of the network with energy values above and below the threshold @xmath84 .",
    "the figure shows that nodes with energy @xmath66 increase their connectivity in time while nodes with energy @xmath67 decrease their connectivity in time . in fig .",
    "@xmath86 we report the number of links attached to nodes of energy @xmath5 , @xmath73 for a system size @xmath87 with the data averaged over @xmath88 runs . in the same figure we report also",
    "the number of nodes stochastically attached to ( detached from ) nodes of energy @xmath5 , @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "= 3.5 in    the connectivity distribution @xmath91 is given by the sum of the probabilities @xmath92 that a node with energy @xmath5 has connectivity @xmath93 .",
    "thus , if @xmath94 we have to sum over all the nodes with energy lower then the threshold @xmath0 , while if @xmath95 the summation will be over the nodes with energies higher than the threshold , p(k)&= & ( k - k_0))__s dp ( ) ^-()with ( ) = 1 + 1/f_mix ( ) with ( ) > 1 & _ s.    in the _ limit @xmath96 _ all the nodes of the network evolve in the same way with    f_mix()== .",
    "thus , if @xmath97 every node increases its connectivity in time while if @xmath98 all the nodes have decreasing connectivity . in the case @xmath99 the mean field equation describes a system in which the connectivities remain constant in time .    on the contrary in the _ limit @xmath100",
    "_ the difference between nodes with different energy is strongly enhanced .",
    "we have to observe that as @xmath101 goes from its highest value @xmath102 to negative values , the energy distribution goes from a pure bose distribution to a mixed distribution with an increasing fermi character , i.e. with a decreasing fermi potential @xmath4 .",
    "but it is impossible to reach the pure fermi statistics in this way .",
    "in fact if we consider the limit @xmath103 , the number of links in the network is not increasing in time , and the new nodes only acquire edges from the rewiring process . in this case",
    "the connectivity of the nodes decreases exponentially as k(t|,t_i)=k_0 ( -e^-(-_f)(t - t_i ) ) with the chemical potential defined by n = dp ( ) m e^(-_f ) .",
    "we observe that in this case the network does nt grow anymore and the number of edges attached to nodes with energy @xmath5 is simply given by the boltzmann occupation factor . in this case the self - consistent equation and the mass conservation relation are not anymore equivalent , the first one reducing , in the thermodynamic limit to an identity .",
    "for this network the probability @xmath91 to find a node with connectivity @xmath93 is given by p(k)= dp ( ) k_0 e^ ( -_f ) , i.e. goes like @xmath104 .",
    "in conclusion we have shown the symmetry between the fermionic and the bosonic networks emphasizing the role of quantum statistics .",
    "these two particular evolving networks are related by the time reversal evident in the continuum equations describing their dynamics and in the reversed unitary unit by which the two network are built .",
    "this time reversal implies that the connectivity increases in time while the survivability of each node decreases in time as an energy - dependent power - law .",
    "the time reversal of the single process generate two different structures with properties and dynamics only described by the functionals @xmath3 and @xmath4 , at every temperature @xmath105 .",
    "having introduced these two limit simple cases and having illustrated their symmetry we have shown that it is possible to construct a new class of networks described by a mixed statistics that can be applied to real systems where the two different growth processes coexist .",
