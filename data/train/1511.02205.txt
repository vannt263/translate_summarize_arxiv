    "disorder such as impurities or vacancies is present in every physical system .",
    "our basic understanding of its effects goes back to anderson @xcite : roughly speaking , the ratio between the electron wavelength and the mean free path determines whether states are extended or localized and hence whether the system is a metal or an insulator . in one or two spatial dimensions ,",
    "an arbitrarily small amount of disorder will localize any eigenstate in the spectrum , but in 3d a so - called mobility edge can exist which separates localized states at the lower end of the spectrum from extended states at high energies .",
    "the transition , which can , e.g. , be triggered by varying the disorder strength , is the so - called anderson transition .",
    "three distinct properties of the localized phase are that a ) the dc conductivity @xmath4 vanishes in the thermodynamic limit at any finite temperature ( if all single - particle states are localized , i.e.  in absence of a mobility edge ) , b ) the system does not thermalize , but information about an initial state is preserved in local observables during a unitary time evolution , and c ) the entanglement entropy is not extensive but features an area law .",
    "reviews of these single - particle localization physics can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "anderson localization is formulated for free particles ; one might wonder whether interactions delocalize every state , render the conductivity finite and lead to thermalization . in a seminal work , however , basko , aleiner , and altshuler suggested that the localized phase can exist even in presence of interactions and that a finite temperature phase transition can exist between phases with @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this phase transition is not a thermodynamic ( equilibrium ) transition but a dynamical quantum phase transition which occurs on the level of the many - body eigenstates and defies standard mermin - wagner arguments .",
    "in contrast to localization in a non - interacting system , the world of many - body localization ( mbl ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) is still comparably young .",
    "basko , aleiner and altshuler s idea was based on perturbative arguments whose range of validity for a given microscopic model is a priori unclear . for one - dimensional lattice systems , the stability of localized states towards adding interactions ",
    "i.e. , the existence of the mbl phase  has subsequently been established fairly convincingly by a number of numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite studies . moreover , there is now solid evidence that a transition into a delocalized phase occurs if the ratio between the interaction and the disorder strength is increased @xcite .",
    "the mbl phase was characterized via level statistics @xcite , entanglement measures @xcite , thermalization behavior @xcite , or integrals of motion @xcite .",
    "some experimentally - accessible observables were computed such as transport properties @xcite or spectral features in presence of a bath @xcite .",
    "mbl physics was observed experimentally in a cold atom setup @xcite",
    ".    however , even in 1d there is a variety of open questions .",
    "first , most of the above - mentioned studies were based on an exact diagonalization of small systems , and since it is unclear how to properly perform a finite - size scaling , very little is known about the nature of the dynamical phase transition between the mbl and the metallic phases ( e.g. , its universality class ) .",
    "second , the issue of a many - body mobility edge in 1d ( its existence and how it depends on the model parameters ) is still debated @xcite , and so is the ensuing question of a quantitative description of the mbl transition as a function of the temperature .",
    "one route to deepen our understanding of many - body localization physics is to approach the problem using different methods which have their own strengths and shortcomings .",
    "in particular , it would be highly desirable to study systems which are larger than those accessible by exact diagonalization . in one dimension , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) allows to elegantly compute ground states ( or finite - entanglement approximations thereof ) as well as those excited states which correspond to ground states in different symmetry sectors . in order to describe mbl physics ,",
    "however , one needs access to generic excited states .",
    "even though many - body localized states feature an entanglement area law and can thus in principle be expressed efficiently as a matrix product state ( mps ) @xcite , no algorithm exits to determine this mps representation in practice ( see below for comments on three recent preprints ) .",
    "it is our goal to introduce a very simple mps - based framework to calculate excited states of mbl systems .",
    "we first perform various internal convergence checks and moreover test the method for the non - interacting case , where we construct eigenstates at a given energy via a monte carlo sampling of the known single - particle levels . we then present extensive data for large systems of @xmath0 sites obtained for large bond dimensions of @xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to quantitatively analyze the scaling of the entanglement entropy .",
    "we also verify the violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis .",
    "indications of a crossover into the metallic phase and the existence of a mobility edge are presented .    shortly before the completion of our work",
    ", we became aware of three preprints @xcite which present similar ideas to access excited states of mbl systems via dmrg algorithms ( these algorithms are more elaborate than the one used here ) ; another method to compute features of the entire spectrum rather than individual states was introduced in preprint @xcite .",
    "we complement these studies in the following way : ( a ) our data was obtained over the course of 9 months using large - scale numerics ( 900.000 core hours ) ; this allows us to access systems which are larger than those investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite and to employ bond dimensions @xmath1 which are much higher than those used in refs .",
    "@xcite , which in turn yields new quantitative insights about the precise scaling of the entanglement in the mbl phase .",
    "( b ) we illustrate how in the non - interacting case an exact solution can be constructed using monte carlo sampling ; since this limit is non - trivial for the dmrg , it provides a non - trivial testing ground for any future algorithmic improvements .",
    "( c ) we re - examine the question of a mobility edge from an entanglement perspective .",

    "the density matrix renormalization group @xcite provides an algorithm to variationally compute the ground state within the class of matrix product states .",
    "the matrix ( bond ) dimension @xmath14 encodes the amount of entanglement @xmath2 in the system .",
    "if the problem at hand features an area law , @xmath2 is non - extensive , and the ground state can thus be represented exactly by a mps with a finite @xmath14 even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more generally , one can think of the dmrg as a tool to determine finite - entanglement approximations .",
    "generalizations of the dmrg algorithm allow to compute ( approximations to ) a few low - lying excited states as well as those excited states which correspond to ground states in a different symmetry sector @xcite .",
    "however , a practical way to extract arbitrary states in the spectrum does not exist even if it is known that they can in principle be expressed efficiently by a mps due to their finite entanglement ; this is exactly the case in localized systems .",
    "moreover , many - body localization can not be understood by only considering ground states , and developing a tool to determine the mps representation of lowly - entangled excited states is thus desirable .",
    "we introduce a simple scheme to calculate finite - entanglement approximations of generic excited states in localized systems .",

    "convergence is checked via the variance of the energy ; we allow for a comparably large value @xmath24 .",

    "however , it is also intuitively clear that this state is _ special _ in the sense that it is always symmetric with respect to @xmath36  by construction , our algorithm lacks the capability to describe other ( asymmetric ) zero - energy states .",
