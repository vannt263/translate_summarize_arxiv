    "we observe in particular that the reversing method need not be optimal but , using the geometric criteria of sections  [ s : van ] and  [ s : sep ] , we characterize cases when reversing turns out to be optimal . also , in a slightly different context of non - equivalent initial expressions , we shall prove that there exist length  @xmath2 expressions  @xmath23 whose reversing require using  @xmath254 braid relations , which is not redundant with proposition  1 .",
    "we recall that an @xmath17-expression is a word on the alphabet @xmath38 .",

    "a reversing diagram becomes a van kampen diagram when all @xmath29-arcs are collapsed ",
    "but we do _ not _ do it , and keep the diagrams as they are now , insisting that they are drawn in a rectangular grid .",
    "a reversing diagram contains three types of tiles :                in the case of  @xmath52 , one implication is clear : by construction , a reversing sequence from  @xmath287 to the empty word gives a reversing diagram for  @xmath27 that concludes with @xmath29-arcs everywhere on the bottom and the right , hence , after collapsing the @xmath29-edges , it gives a van kampen diagram for  @xmath27 , thus proving that @xmath12 and  @xmath13 are equivalent .",

    "if @xmath23 are arbitrary expressions , then the reserving diagram for @xmath27 is still finite , and it finishes with arrows forming a word of the form  @xmath288 where @xmath285 are two expressions that need not be empty . then collapsing all the @xmath29-labeled arcs yields a van kampen diagram for the pair  @xmath289 .",
    "it can be shown that , if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are reduced , then @xmath290 and  @xmath291 are reduced and equivalent  the latter point is obvious as , by construction , the reversing diagram for  @xmath215 provides a van kampen diagram for @xmath289and the permutation represented by  @xmath290 and  @xmath291 is the least upper bound of the permutations represented by  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 with respect to the weak order of  @xmath147  @xcite .",
    "equivalently , the reversing complexity  @xmath30 is the number of nontrivial steps in a reversing sequence from  @xmath28 to a word of the form  @xmath292 . by the above remarks , a reversing diagram for  @xmath215 with @xmath201  nontrivial tiles provides a van kampen diagram for  @xmath289 with @xmath201  tiles , where @xmath288 is the final word of the reversing process .",
