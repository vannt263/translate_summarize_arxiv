    "studies of galaxy formation and evolution at high redshift greatly benefit from multi - object spectroscopy , which is widely accessible from the ground . how far in lookback time one can go is ,",
    "though , severely limited by the emission spectrum of the night sky .",
    "this can be overcome with observations from the space , by performing multi - object spectroscopy which turns out to be rather sensitive to compact sources .",
    "indeed , as shown by the grapes program ( pirzkal et al .",
    "2004 ) , grism spectroscopy with the hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) can detect the continuum emission of sources as faint as z@xmath2 27 in 40 orbits .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy with hst comes with low spectral resolution to compensate for the telescope size , and without slits .",
    "as we will discuss in the next sections , the absence of a slit allows spectra of different sources to overlap , the size of the source to decrease the instrumental spectral resolution and the background to increase since each pixel collects the background emission integrated over the whole spectral range of the dispersing element .",
    "slitless spectroscopy has been made available with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) since its launch , in 1990 .",
    "the first instruments to be equipped with grism / prism elements were the wide field planetary camera 1 ( wfpc1 ) and the esa faint object camera ( foc ) .",
    "wfpc1 contained an uv grism ( g200l , horne & mackenty 1991 ) , covering the spectral range between 1300   and 4000   with a resolving power of about 100 ( at @xmath3 = 3000  ) in the first order . the grism was not extensively calibrated in wavelength and flux and was never used for go science observations . during the time of wfpc1",
    ", hst was not yet corrected for spherical aberration .",
    "two prisms were mounted in the foc ; they covered the spectral ranges 1150   @xmath4 6000    and 1600   @xmath4 6000 with a resolving power r @xmath5 100 at @xmath3 = 1500   and @xmath5 250 at @xmath3 = 2500  , respectively .",
    "they provided slitless , fuv and nuv spectroscopy across the f/96 ( 14@xmath6 14@xmath7 ) and f/48 ( 28@xmath6 28@xmath7 ) fields of view .",
    "both prisms were supported modes of foc , i.e. they were calibrated in wavelength and flux before launch and in - orbit ( cf .",
    "paresce & greenfield 1989 , hack 1992 , hack 1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the foc prisms were seldomly requested by users during the 7 year life - time of this instrument .",
    "the foc prisms were used to address a number of scientific cases , such as the measurement of the uv flux shortward of @xmath3 = 1800   for a sample of qsos at @xmath8 3 ( jakobsen et al .",
    "1993 ) ; the study of the uv morphology and expansion of the sn 1987a ejecta ( jansen & jakobsen 2001 ) ; and to spatially resolve the spectra of the giant stars in the capella binary system ( young & dupree 2002 ) .    since",
    "1997 slitless spectroscopy has become feasible also at infrared wavelengths with nicmos camera 3 , which is equipped with three grisms ( g096 , g141 and g206 ) covering the spectral range 0.8 - 2.5 @xmath1 m at a resolving power of @xmath5 200 ( noll et al .",
    "while the first two grisms exploit the low background of hst , g206 is subject to the thermal background emission from hst .",
    "the three grisms provide multi - object spectroscopy over a field of view of 51@xmath6 51@xmath7 at a spatial resolution of 0.2@xmath7/pix , and were mainly used to study the evolution of field galaxies at 0.7 @xmath9 1.9 ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1999 ) and to investigate the nature of planets and kuiper belt objects ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1998 ) . during the first two years of nicmos ,",
    "the grisms were calibrated in wavelength and flux in orbit , by observing a galactic planetary nebula and a white dwarf .",
    "software for extracting spectra ( nicmoslook ) was released by freudling & pirzkal ( 1997 ) and freudling ( 1999 ) .",
    "the nicmos grisms have been quite extensively used , by both go proposals and parallel programs . prior to the servicing mission 3b ,",
    "the accepted go proposals requiring spectroscopy represented about 14@xmath10 of all the successful nicmos proposals , while in the case of foc the approved proposals making use of the prisms amount to only @xmath5 4@xmath10 of the total .    although designed as a slit , high - to - medium resolution spectrograph ,",
    "stis has also provided slitless spectroscopy mostly with the g750l grating ( r @xmath5 750 at 7500  ) when employed in parallel mode .",
    "an iraf routine ( slitless in stsdas / stecf ) was developed by n. pirzkal for the extraction of slitless spectra .    the slitless parallel data of stis have been analyzed to search for new low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( plait 1998a and 1998b ) , to study the intermediate - redshift universe ( de mello & pasquali 2001 , teplitz et al . 2001 , teplitz et al .",

    "_ before establishing their dispersion solution",
    "_ , involve a change of pixel size and geometry which in turn affect the dispersion and zero point of the wavelength calibration and also the amplitude and wavelength dependence of the flat - field correction for grism spectra .",
    "these quantities depend on the drizzle parameters which can be specified differently each time by different users .",
    "for these reasons , the grism calibration has been performed only for raw grism data .",
    "the acs is a three - channel instrument which performs broad and narrow band filter imaging from uv to nir , polarimetric imaging at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths , and low - resolution slitless spectroscopy in the range from @xmath5 1150   to @xmath3 @xmath5 1 @xmath1 m with a set of grism and prisms ( cf .",
    "http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents ) .",
    "the acs spectral elements can be summarized as follow :    the wide field channel ( wfc ) has a 3@xmath11.4 @xmath12 3@xmath11.4 field of view at a spatial resolution of 0.05@xmath7/pix and is equipped with a grism ( g800l ) covering the spectral range from 5500    to 1 @xmath1 m with a response peak at @xmath5 7200   and @xmath5 6000    in the 1@xmath14 and 2@xmath15 orders , respectively .",
    "the grism resolving power is @xmath5 100 and the dispersion is nearly linear , @xmath5 39  / pix in the 1@xmath14 order and @xmath5 20  / pix in the 2@xmath15 order .",
    "the tilt of the spectra is nearly -2@xmath16 from the image x axis , varying slightly across the field .",
    "the high resolution channel ( hrc ) is characterized by a 26@xmath6 29@xmath7 fov with a spatial resolution of 0.027@xmath7/pix and uses the same grism of the wfc , which introduces a tilt in the spectra of -38@xmath16 ( from the image x axis ) and offers a dispersion of @xmath5 24  / pix in the 1@xmath14 order and of @xmath5 13  / pix in the 2@xmath15 order .",
    "the hrc also features a prism ( pr200l ) covering the 1600 - 5000   range , with a non linear dispersion varying from 2.6  / pix at 1600   to 105  / pix at 3500   and 560  / pix at 5000  .    the solar blind channel ( sbc ) has a field of view of 31@xmath6 35@xmath7 where each pixel is 0.032@xmath7 in size .",
    "two prisms are available with the sbc : pr110l covering from 1150   to 2000  , and pr130l from 1220   to 2000 (i.e .",
    "geocoronal ly@xmath13 is blocked ) .",
    "the dispersion of pr110l is 2.6  / pix at 1216  , while the dispersion of pr130l varies from 1.65  / pix at 1250 to 20.2  / pix at 1800  .",
    "the acs grism and prisms are used in slitless mode .",
    "this raises a number of important issues :    _ i ) _ the extension of a source along the dispersion axis is given by the spatial profile of the object , and affects the achievable spectral resolution .    _",
    "ii ) _ the zero point of the grism wavelength calibration is defined by the position of the object in the direct image . when no direct image of the source is available , the position of the 0@xmath17 order can also be used ,",
    "though in a less accurate way since the 0@xmath17 order is itself dispersed .",
    "_ iii ) _ the spectroscopic flat - field is field and wavelength dependent . depending on the position of a target in the direct image , the same pixel in the grism / prism image receives different wavelengths .    _",
    "iv ) _ each pixel in a grism / prism spectrum has a contribution from the background emission which is integrated over the entire spectral range of the grism / prism .",
    "_ v ) _ depending on the luminosity of a source , the grism orders higher than 1 ( at higher x coordinates in the grism image ) and the grism negative orders ( at lower x coordinates ) can be identified .",
    "no filter can be used to suppress higher and negative orders .    _",
    "vi ) _ depending on the position of the object in the direct image , the source spectrum can be truncated in the grism / prism image .",
    "objects outside the field of view can still produce spectra in the grism / prism image .    _ vii ) _ the extension of grism spectra and the number of their orders can give overlap and contamination among spectra of adjacent objects .",
    "therefore , the wavelength calibration of the acs grism and prisms requires a full description of the grism / prisms physical properties , such as the tilt of the spectra , the length of the prism spectra and of the grism orders together with their separation from the grism 0@xmath17 order , the ( x , y ) offsets between the object position in the direct image and the corresponding 0@xmath17 order in the grism image . indeed",
    ", these quantities allow the identification of the spectrum in the grism / prism image of any object in the direct image , the tracing of spectra and set the size of the aperture extraction for each prism spectrum and grism order ( pasquali et al .",
    "2003a , b ) . as described in the next sections",
    ", these parameters are field - dependent because of the geometric distortions of acs .",
    "this is also true for the flat - field , which an accurate flux calibration of the spectra depends on .",
    "since no slit is available , the nominal dispersion of the acs grism gets convolved with the object size and , in the case of non - round sources , with the object size along the dispersion axis as determined by the object orientation .",
    "this convolution obviously lowers the grism resolution and plays a key role in planning the spectroscopic calibrations and the go observations with the acs ( pasquali et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "to quantify the effect of object size and orientation on the effective dispersion of the grism , we have simulated the optical spectrum of the galactic planetary nebula ngc 7009 using slim 1.0 ( pirzkal & pasquali 2001 , pirzkal et al .",
    "slim 1.0 is a slitless spectroscopy simulator developed by n. pirzkal and is designed to produce realistic and photometrically correct spectra acquired with the acs grism and prisms .",
    "briefly , any input spectrum is redshifted as required and scaled to a desired magnitude in a reference filter , then dispersed according to the grism / prisms dispersion solution . at each wavelength , the dispersed spectrum is convolved with the grism / prisms throughput curve and with a gaussian psf whose fwhm value is set by the hst diffraction limit at any specific wavelength .",
    "two sets of simulations have been produced for both the wfc and the hrc which do not include background or read - out noise .",
    "the first set is based on the assumption that ngc 7009 is disc - shaped , with uniform surface brightness and diameter varying from 0@xmath7.05 to 0@xmath7.1 , 0@xmath7.4 and 1@xmath7 for the wfc , and from 0@xmath7.06 to 0@xmath7.2 and 0@xmath7.5 for the hrc .",
    "the second set assumes that ngc 7009 is elliptical with a varying position angle ( pa ) with respect to the dispersion axis .",
    "the nebula size is 0@xmath7.1 @xmath12 0@xmath7.25 and 0@xmath7.05 @xmath12 0@xmath7.12 for the wfc and the hrc respectively .",
    "the pa of the nebula major axis is assumed to vary from 0@xmath16 to 20@xmath16 , 45@xmath16 and 90@xmath16 so that the object major axis progressively goes from being aligned along to being perpendicular to the dispersion axis .",
    "we have measured the fwhm of a few lines in the 1@xmath14 and 2@xmath15 order spectra obtained for the wfc and the hrc in both sets of simulations , in order to quantify the _ degradation _ of the grism nominal dispersion as a function of object size .",
    "these fwhm values have been normalized to the fwhm of a source with a 0@xmath7.05 diameter and are plotted in figure 1 as a function of the object size along the dispersion axis in arcsecs , for both the wfc and the hrc .",
    "as expected , the line fwhm nearly doubles by doubling the object linear size , implying that the grism dispersion degrades by almost the same factor as the object size increases .",
    "the flattening in the curves for linear sizes larger than 3 @xmath12 0@xmath7.05 for the wfc ( 3 @xmath12 0@xmath7.03 for the hrc ) is due to severe line blending which makes the line width measurements unreliable .",
    "during the ground testing of acs at the goddard space flight center , the refractive aberration simulator ( ras / ramp ) was used to acquire a series of grism spectra for both the wfc and the hrc .",
    "specifically , spectra were obtained through a 4 @xmath1 m pinhole aperture fed by an argon lamp and qth fiber lamp sources .",
    "spectra were acquired at different positions across the field of view , located close to the center and to the ccd amplifiers in the corners .",
    "these data provided a first wavelength calibration , and also allowed to check the amplitude of the field dependence of the grism resolution .",
    "the spectra of the continuum lamp were used to derive the relative , integrated throughput of the different grism orders across the field of view , but were not suited to determine the throughput as a function of wavelength for the various grism orders .",
    "we could then establish that the total power in the 0@xmath17 order is 2.5@xmath10 of that in the 1@xmath14 order , and 1@xmath10 and 0.5@xmath10 in the positive and negative higher orders , respectively .",
    "since the grism is sensitive to wavelengths redder than 5500  , we could identify and use only the argon lines redward of 6700  .",
    "this made the wavelength solutions of the grism orders less accurate than those derived in orbit ( cf . sects .",
    "9 and 10 ) .",
    "for example , the wavelength solution of the positive 1@xmath14 order could only be fitted with a first - order polynomial , which , later on , gave raise to significant wavelength offsets in the spectra of the in - orbit calibrators .",
    "the results obtained in sect . 3 pose important constraints on the planning of wavelength calibration observations , such as those foreseen for the servicing mission orbital verification ( smov , following the installation of acs onboard hst ) tests and subsequent go calibration programs .",
    "acs is not equipped with arc lamps , therefore the in - orbit dispersion correction of the grism can only be determined from observations of specific astrophysical sources . for this purpose , calibration targets should satisfy the following requirements :    _ i ) _ the spatial extension of the target should be minimal , to allow accurate determination of the dispersion and wavelength zero point ;    _ ii ) _ the target brightness allows for reasonably short exposure times ;    _ iii ) _ the target spectra should contain a significant number of unblended emission lines ;    _ iv ) _ no extended nebulosity is associated with the targets which would degrade the dispersion of the instrument and increase the local background ;    _ v ) _ the spectrophotometric variability ( either intrinsic or induced by an eclipsing companion or by orbital motion ) is negligible so that emission features can be identified at the same wavelength at any observational date ;    _ vi ) _ the targets should not lie in crowded fields to avoid contamination by nearby spectra .",
    "spectroscopy in slitless mode relies on a pair of direct and grism images , since the zero point of the grism wavelength solution is set by the position of the object in the direct image . because the acs is tilted with respect to the optical axis of hst , its field of view suffers severe geometric distortions which introduce a field dependence in the grism dispersion and wavelength zero point .",
    "hence , calibration targets have to be observed at a number of positions across the wfc and hrc chips in order to be able to parameterize the field dependence of the grism wavelength solution .",
    "this need strengthens requirement _ i ) _ : the exposure times for the calibration targets should be reasonably short to allow multiple acquisitions across the field of view .",
    "in what follows , we discuss the observational strategy adopted for the smov tests and following go calibrations in order to achieve the wavelength calibration of the acs grism .      at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the spectra of planetary nebulae are dominated by strong , narrow emission lines mainly due to h , hei , [ o  ii ] , [ n  ii ] , [ o  iii ] and [ s  iii ] .",
    "the [ o  iii ] and [  nii ] lines are often used to measure the expansion velocity of planetary nebulae ( pne ) ; galactic pne span a wide range in expansion velocities , from @xmath18 5 km s@xmath19 to 50 km s@xmath19 ( acker et al .",
    "1992 ) . in the worst case",
    ", an expansion velocity of 50 km s@xmath19 corresponds to a fwhm value of @xmath18 1  at the restframe h@xmath13 line . with a resolving power of r",
    "@xmath5 100 , the acs grism does not resolve any planetary nebula in velocity and any planetary nebula would be equivalent to a ground arc lamp . among all the known pne ,",
    "only those which are compact ( with a full size smaller than 0.1@xmath7 ) can be observed with the acs grism according to the requirements listed in sect .",
    "4 . pne in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds are rarely compact when imaged with hst and even when compact often have a low intensity halo .",
    "therefore , in order to preserve the nominal dispersion of the acs grism , we have to resort to more distant pne , for example those in m31 .",
    "to assess the feasibility of grism observations of extragalactic pne in terms of exposure time and s / n ratio in the lines , we simulated the acs spectra of the brightest and most compact pne in m31 using slim 1.0 ( cf .",
    "pasquali et al .",
    "the selected pne were originally studied by ciardullo et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and jacoby & ciardullo ( 1999 ) .",
    "our simulations show that pne can be used to determine the dispersion correction of the grism 1@xmath14 order , but fail the wavelength calibration of the 2@xmath15 since only two lines can be detected with a reasonable s / n ratio . to improve this , the integration time should be longer by a factor of @xmath183 ( equivalent to @xmath18 1 h per pointing ) , thus making pne too time - consuming for routine go calibration programs . an additional disadvantage of observing pne in m31",
    "is the field crowding , which makes spectra of adjacent sources overlap .",
    "nevertheless , pne can be employed as secondary targets , to verify the accurateness of the wavelength calibration .",
    "having discharged pne , our simulations show that galactic wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars satisfy the calibration requirements . as figure 2",
    "points out , wr stars of spectral type wc6 - wc9 have a large number of bright emission lines ( he and c ) in the spectral range covered by the acs grism . the only drawback here is that the velocity of their stellar winds considerably broadens their emission features .",
    "the known galactic wr stars ( van der hucht 2001 ) have wind velocities between @xmath18 700 km s@xmath19 and 3300 km s@xmath19 with a mean wind speed of about 1700 km s@xmath19 and with 19@xmath10 of the sample having a wind velocity larger than 2100 km s@xmath19 .",
    "we thus assumed a wind speed of 2000 km s@xmath19 and computed the line broadening induced in wfc and hrc grism spectra of wr stars .",
    "the results indicate that such a stellar wind is hardly resolved in the 1@xmath14 order spectra and partially affects the 2@xmath15 order spectra .",
    "higher wind velocities rapidly decrease the grism resolution at any order .    clearly , the wind velocity constraint ( @xmath20 2000 km s@xmath19 ) has to be added to the selection criteria discussed earlier in sect .",
    "4 , together with the requirement that the variability of the selected targets is negligible .",
    "spectro - photometric variability could change the number of detectable emission lines , and variability in the stellar wind could change the line fwhm ; both cases would make the grism wavelength calibration less accurate . from the catalogue of van der hucht ( 2001 ) ,",
    "we have selected two stars , wr45 and wr96 , whose spectral type , coordinates , v magnitude and wind velocity are listed in table 1 .",
    "we produced slim 1.0 spectra based on two wr templates kindly provided by p. crowther and closely matching the spectral types of wr45 and wr96 .",
    "the simulations are plotted in figures 2 and 3 for the wfc and the hrc 1@xmath14 and 2@xmath15 orders , respectively . in the case of the wfc simulations , an exposure time of 10",
    "s and 60 s has been assumed for the 1@xmath14 and 2@xmath15 order , respectively , while for the hrc 20 s and 60 s. contrary to the planetary nebula case , the simulated spectra of wr45 and wr96 indicate that a relatively large sample of emission lines can be used for the wavelength calibration of both the 1@xmath14 and 2@xmath15 orders of the acs grism .    as a counter - check , the simulated spectra of wr45 and",
    "wr96 have been used to derive the grism wavelength solution for both the wfc and the hrc .",
    "we have measured the position of each identified line in the slim output in pixels scaled to the position of the object in the direct image , and fitted pixels against wavelength assuming a first order polynomial .",
    "the accuracy of the dispersion correction thus obtained is better than 0.3 pixels for both the 1@xmath14 and 2@xmath15 order ( i.e. 12  and 7  , respectively ) .      since no high resolution spectra were available in literature at the time of the acs ground calibrations , we observed wr45 and wr96 with the emmi spectrograph , mounted on the eso ntt telescope ( 266.d-5653 , pi pasquali ) .",

    "we selected 10 pointings for the wfc ( among which the five from the ground tests ) and 5 ( only those observed during the ground calibrations ) for the hrc , in order to sample the field dependence of the grism properties , which ground - based calibrations indicated to be smaller for the hrc .",
    "wr96 was re - observed in cycle 12 together with the planetary nebula smp-81 in the lmc ( program 10058 , pi walsh ) .",
    "these observations were designed to provide additional sampling points across the field of view to better map the spatial variation of the wavelength solution .",

    "it is worth noticing here that the 3@xmath23 orders are out of focus .",

    "the flux calibration of the acs grism requires the correction for flat - field and for the total grism throughput , which takes into account the intrinsic grism response , the quantum efficiency of the ccd detectors and the throughput of the telescope and instrument optics .    in the case of slitless spectroscopy ,",
    "the flat - field is field and wavelength dependent at the same time . indeed , depending on the coordinates of a source in the direct image , the same pixel in the grism image is exposed to different wavelengths during different telescope pointings and grism acquisitions .",
    "a grism flat - field can be then constructed via interpolation of the flat - fields available for different imaging filters at any pixel position and wavelength , i.e. what is refereed to as a flat - field cube . for this purpose",
    ", we used a 3@xmath23 order polynomial as a function of pixel coordinates and wavelength , which is directly used by the extraction package axe ( pirzkal et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "technically , the correction for flat - field is applied following the wavelength calibration of a spectrum : only at this point , it is possible to extract a monodimensional flat - field from the flat - field cube in correspondence with the source position in the direct image and the wavelength range of the source spectrum .",
    "ideally , the grism flat - field cube should be constructed from the flat - fields of narrow - band filters , in order to better sample the wavelength space of the grism spectra and therefore to perform an accurate flux calibration .",
    "practically , the available grism flat - field cubes ( for the wfc and the hrc at http://www.stecf.org/instrument/acs ) are based on in - orbit flat - fields for broad - band filters which describe the large scale variations in the ccd response up to @xmath34 9000  .    in the case of the wfc , taking the broad - band filter flat - fields at face value generates a grism flat - field cube which produces flux discrepancies among the grism spectra of the standard star gd153 ( the same occurs for g191b2b ) observed at different positions across the field of view .",
    "these differences in flux possibly arise from a large - scale flat properties of the grism images that are different from those seen in direct images .",
    "in addition , since the imaging flat - fields are designed to give a flat image of the sky , their application to a grism image introduces a correction for the geometric distortions which is already been taking into account in the wavelength calibration of the extracted spectra .",
    "consequently , the differences in flux among the standard star spectra taken in different positions were fitted with a 2d surface which was used to generate a _ corrected _ grism flat - field cube , able to produce spectra of the same star which agree within 1@xmath10 between 6000  and 9000  and 2 - 3@xmath10 at redder wavelengths , all across the field of view of the wfc ( pirzkal et al .",
    "2003a , b , walsh & pirzkal 2005 ) .    in the case of the hrc ,",
    "the standard star gd153 was observed only in three positions out of the five which were adopted for the wavelength calibration .",
    "a simple grism flat - field cube , without any correction as applied to the wfc cube , generates spectra whose fluxes already agree within 2 @xmath10 , most likely because of the much lower degree of geometric distortions in the hrc with respect to the wfc ( pirzkal et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "the spectra extracted for gd153 and g191b2b , calibrated in wavelength and properly corrected for flat - field and ccd gain , were normalized by the exposure time , and divided by the stsdas template spectrum calibrated in flux .",
    "the resulting sensitivity functions ( in e@xmath35 pix@xmath19  per erg @xmath36 @xmath19 ) were averaged into a single grism response curve independent of the position across the chip and the standard deviation of the mean was assumed to be the error on the grism throughput .",
    "the errors in the absolute flux calibration are then 3@xmath10 between 5000  and 9000  and 20@xmath10 past 10000  .",
    "the mean wfc / hrc grism responses obtained for the 1@xmath14 order are plotted in figure 13 .",
    "they are delivered with the axe package and can be found at http://www.stecf.org/software/axe together with the grism higher order responses .",
    "a secondary effect in the wfc / hrc grism spectra is fringing , due to the interference between the incident light and the light reflected at the interfaces between the thin layers of the ccds .",
    "the modeling of fringes is possible once the layer composition of the ccd detector , the thickness and material of these layers are known . in the case of acs , these parameters are not available ( the wfc ccds have proprietary construction ) , and are estimated by comparison of a fringe model with narrow - band filter flat - fields .",
    "walsh et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found that the peak - to - peak amplitude of the fringes in the hrc ( @xmath5 27@xmath10 ) is reproduced by assuming a ccd model with four layers : the si top layer 12.5 - 16.0 @xmath1 m thick , the second sio@xmath37 layer 0.26 @xmath1 m in thickness , the third si@xmath38n@xmath39 and the fourth si layers with a 0.23 @xmath1 m and 0.83 @xmath1 m thickness respectively .",
    "similarly , the wfc fringes are characterized by a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath5 24@xmath10 which is reproduced by the same four layers ccd model adopted for the hrc , only with different thicknesses : 12.6 - 17.0 @xmath1 m for the top layer , 1.14 @xmath1 m , 0.90 @xmath1 m and 3.08 @xmath1 m for the second , third and fourth layer respectively .",
    "the predictions of the above ccd models can be use to correct the narrow - band filter flat - fields for fringing : the net result is a decrease of the fringes peak - to - peak amplitude of about four .",
    "does fringing affect grism spectra ?",
    "the incident light on the grism is convolved with the instrument psf along both the dispersion and cross - dispersed axes . in the case of the wfc ,",
    "the fwhm of the psf is @xmath5 2.5 pixels , or 100  assuming @xmath30 = 40  .",
    "the fringes period is @xmath1870  , therefore the psf has the net effect of smoothing out the fringes envelope , by a factor of six as slim simulations show .",
    "therefore , fringing in the wfc grism spectra is practically negligible . since the grism dispersion is higher when coupled with the hrc ( @xmath30 @xmath5 24  ) and the fringes period is 65  , some residual fringing",
    "may still be observed in hrc grism spectra ( walsh et al .",
    "2003 ) .    at the present time",
    ", a routine for the fringing correction is being planned for axe .",
    "the in - orbit calibrations of the acs grism served the purpose to characterize its physical properties ( i.e. spectral tilt ) and the wavelength solution for each of its detected orders .",
    "equally important , the calibrations were performed in selected positions across the wfc and hrc fields of view to verify the field dependence of the grism properties .",
    "the next step is therefore to be able to extract and calibrate a spectrum in wavelength and flux _ at any position in the field of view_. this is achieved by interpolating each of the quantities derived in the previous sections across the chip as a function of the ( x , y ) coordinates of the calibration stars , wr45 and wr96 , in the direct image .",
    "each interpolation describes the smooth spatial variation of the grism properties .",
    "specifically , the quantities that need to be interpolated are : the spectral tilt , the y - offset and , for each order , the dispersion ( the second term of the dispersion when available ) and wavelength zero point . in the case of the wfc , the observed positions allowed us to parameterize the grism field dependence with second - order 2d polymonials , which , in the case of the grism 1@xmath14 order , are characterized by an error of 0@xmath16.03 in the spectral tilt , 0.10 pixels in the y - offset , 10 and 5  in the wavelength zero point in chip 1 and 2 , respectively , 0.6@xmath10 and 0.4@xmath10 in the first ( @xmath30 ) term of the dispersion in chip 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the second ( @xmath31 ) term is characterized by a r.m.s of 27@xmath10 and 22@xmath10 in chip 1 and 2 , respectively ( larsen & walsh 2005 ) .",
    "these interpolations were used to extract the spectra of the planetary nebula smp-81 , which in turn confirmed the consistency of the grism wavelength calibration .    since",
    "only 5 positions were acquired across the hrc field of view , we interpolated the grism properties with a first - order 2d polynomial , which , for the 1@xmath14 order , has errors of 0@xmath16.0005 in the spectral tilt , 0.4 pixels in the y - offset , 4.8  ( i.e. 0.2 pixels ) in the wavelength zero point and 0.2@xmath10 and 10@xmath10 in the first ( @xmath30 ) and second ( @xmath31 ) terms of the dispersion ( pasquali et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "the coefficients of the 2d polynomials fitting the field dependence of the grism properties are stored in _ configuration files _",
    "( one for each wfc chip and one for hrc ) which are used by axe and can be retrieved at http://www.stecf.org/software/axe .",
    "the configuration files contain three other fundamental keywords : the name of the flat - field cube to be applied for the flat - field correction , the name of the sensitivity function for the flux calibration and the length of the orders in pixels .    to test the consistency of our interpolation , we re - extracted the spectra of wr45 and wr96 with axe and the configuration files described above .",
    "figure 14 shows the results for the different pointings across chip 1 of the wfc .",
    "the spectra coincide within 0.4 [ @xmath18 16  , or 0.2 pixels ( @xmath18 5  ) in the case of the hrc ] .",
    "observations with the acs grism require science targets to be imaged through a filter ( direct image ) and the grism ( grism image ) .",
    "the reason is that the target position in the direct image defines the zero point in the wavelength calibration and the flat - field correction for the flux calibration of a spectrum in the grism image .",
    "calibration data have shown that the object position in the direct image is independent of the filter used for imaging and is stable within 25 mas ( 0.5 pixels ) when multiple acquisitions are performed within the same orbit .",
    "direct images taken of the same target with the same postarg values during different orbits are instead stable within 100 mas ( 2 pixels ) .",
    "while a shift of @xmath40 0.5 pixels ( i.e. about 20  in the grism first order spectrum ) is within the uncertainties of the wavelength calibration , an offset of 2 pixels introduces a systematic error of @xmath18 80  in the wavelength calibration of the grism 1@xmath14 order .",
    "it is thus advisable to always acquire a direct image of the targeted field together with its grism images . in the case of multiple exposures of the same field with dither shifts",
    ", it suffices to have one direct image corresponding to one of the grism images and to use the 0@xmath17 orders to confirm the telescope shifts ( e.g. this technique was applied by pirzkal et al .",
    "2004 to the grapes data ) .",
    "direct images can be combined to increase the s / n threshold for the detection of faint objects , but the positions of the objects measured in the final drizzled version have to be related to positions in the raw , geometrically distorted frame for a correct use of axe ( cf .",
    "pirzkal et al .",
    "a spectroscopic drizzle task has been implemented in the latest version of axe ( axe-1.4 , kmmel et al .",
    "2004 ) , which extracts 2d stamp images of a source spectrum appearing in multiple grism images , fully calibrated in wavelength and corrected for flat field .",
    "in the most general case , the source has been imaged in different positions across the field of view , therefore , because of the field dependence of the spectral dispersion , its spectra are characterized by different spectral dispersions .",
    "the axe drizzle corrects the tilt of the individual spectral stamp image , so that its dispersion and the cross - dispersed axes are parallel to the x and y axes , respectively .",
    "it also makes the wavelength scale and the pixel scale in the cross - dispersed direction the same in all the spectral stamp images of the source .",
    "these drizzled stamp images are then coadded , and the final 1d spectrum of the source is extracted and flux calibrated , using a weighting scheme based on the s / n variations as provided by the drizzle weights ( hence proportional to the different exposure times of the observations ) .",
    "users can set the wavelength scale and the pixel scale in the cross - dispersed direction in the axe configuration file ; this option allows to enhance the resolution ( spectral and angular ) of the extracted spectra if the original data were taken with subpixel stepping .",
    "the acs slitless grism is equivalent to a ground - based multi - object spectrograph .",
    "the absence of a slit , though , affects the grism resolution , which the object size and inclination with respect to the dispersion axis can easily decrease ( cf .",
    "this effect can be modeled by , for example , deconvolving the spectrum by the spatial profile of the source , once the latter is known as a function of wavelength .",
    "in addition , the large extension of the grism orders may cause spectra of two adjacent objects to overlap . in its present form axe provides a quantitative estimate of contamination but it does not correct for spectra contamination .",
    "therefore it is suggested to acquire data using different telescope roll angles so to vary the direction of the dispersion axis and reduce the amount of spectra overlap .",
    "also , orienting the telescope so that the dispersion axis is aligned with the object minor axis , certainly maximizes the spectral resolution achievable for that target .",
    "a final note has to be spent on the background level .",
    "since each pixel of the spectrum sees the background emission integrated over the whole spectral range of the grism , the use of a high s / n background image , properly scaled to the exposure time of the data , will improve the s / n in the extracted spectra of faint sources .",
    "as already mentioned before , acs slitless grism spectroscopy has extensively been carried out by large programs such as apples ( acs pure parallel ly@xmath13 emission survey , pi rhoads , i d 9482 ) , grapes ( grism acs program for extragalactic science , pi malhotra , i d 9793 ) and pears ( probing evolution and reionization spectroscopically , pi malhotra , i d 10530 ) .",
    "grapes in particular has proved that the acs grism can detect the continuum emission of sources as faint as z@xmath41 = 27.2 mag and up to @xmath42 7 using 40 orbits ( pirzkal et al .",
    "this is the deepest slitless spectroscopy survey to date , even when compared with ground - based telescopes .",

    "<S> given the lack of any on - board calibration lamps for wavelength and narrow band flat - fielding , the g800l grism can only be calibrated using astronomical targets . in this paper </S>",
