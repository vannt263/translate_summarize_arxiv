    "a continuous phase transition at zero temperature defines a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , with a diverging length - scale for quantum - fluctuations and a diverging time scale for dynamics.@xcite the renormalization group  @xcite can be extended to the study of qcp,@xcite which has become a popular concept among theoreticians , given the enhanced predictive power of the calculations .",
    "for instance , the experimental finding of a qcp has been postulated to underlie the physics of high - temperature superconductors  @xcite and spin - ladders,@xcite it has been used to predict the scaling behavior for meta - magnetic quantum criticality in metals,@xcite or to study the effects of disorder in quantum spin - chains.@xcite the localization transition of non interacting electrons in the presence of disorder  @xcite is another type of continuous phase transition at zero temperature .",
    "the experimental finding of a qcp compatible with the theoretical expectations for the anderson metal - insulator transition  @xcite would be very interesting .",
    "note that the anderson transition is not the cause of the metal - insulator transition in la@xmath10ca@xmath8mno@xmath6,@xcite a well known colossal magnetoresitance ( cmr ) manganite.@xcite    in this paper , we want to address the behavior of typical cmr manganites when doped at the mn sites @xmath11 where ae = ca ,",
    "sr and tr = fe , al , ga , in the range @xmath12 . some experimental work has already been done for this materials  @xcite but , from the present analysis we believe that several interesting features have not still been found experimentally .",
    "specifically , we will show that , from the knowledge gained in the study of the phase diagrams of ( la@xmath13re@xmath14)@xmath10sr@xmath8mno@xmath6 and ( la@xmath13re@xmath14)@xmath10ca@xmath8mno@xmath6 , where re is a trivalent rare earth , and from our model calculations , one can conclude that :    \\i ) when the @xmath15 material shows a first order transition from the paramagnetic state ( pm ) to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) one , like in la@xmath2ca@xmath3mno@xmath6  @xcite , a qcp should appear close to 15% ga substitution ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "unfortunately previous experimental work  @xcite did not go beyond 10% of ga , but more experiments will be done.@xcite in this case , it is interesting that the localization transition determines the magnetic behavior and then , through the corresponding _",
    "magnetic _ critical exponents , it may be possible to investigate the physical properties of such qcp experimentally . in this context ,",
    "note that disorder added to a system with a low @xmath18 first order transition separating ordered phases ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and fig .",

    "fminsulator transition at finite temperature should take place ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the layout of the rest of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the experimentally known effects of mn substitution and we will discuss the simplest model that can account for it .",
    "we will first consider the relatively simpler case of fe @xmath0 mn substitution , and we will then address the case of gallium . from now on ,",
    "we will not be concerned with the al case , because this substitution causes the lattice to loose oxygen for @xmath21 , and a significant amount of oxygen vacancies are present.@xcite this phenomenon can easily be taken into account with a proper modification of the present model , but this is left for future work . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results , while the conclusions , comments , and predictions are left for the last section .",
    "in previous works,@xcite we have considered the simplest model that describes the magnetic properties of ( la@xmath13re@xmath14)@xmath10ae@xmath8mno@xmath6 and we concluded that , for @xmath12 such model is the single orbital double exchange model ( dem ) on a cubic lattice @xcite with isotropic hopping and super - exchange antiferromagnetic first - neighbors interaction : @xmath22 where @xmath23 corresponds to a mn @xmath24 orbital while @xmath25 stands for a unit vector oriented parallel to the mn@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) core spins , which we assume to be classical.@xcite the function @xmath28 $ ] stands for the overlap of two spin 1/2 spinors oriented along the directions defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , whose polar and azimuthal angles are denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the hopping integral , @xmath33 , is approximately 0.16 ev.@xcite as far as the magnetic interactions are concerned , one can trade the effects of phonons,@xcite by tuning the superexchange constant @xmath34.@xcite the phase diagram of the model  ( [ hamil ] ) has been extensively studied by means of the variational mean - field ( vmf ) technique  @xcite and by the hybrid monte carlo method.@xcite these studies have shown that the parameter @xmath34 is rather constrained .",
    "on one hand , if one wants to reproduce the first - order character of the pm - fm phase transition,@xcite one should have @xmath34 larger than @xmath35.@xcite but , on the other hand , the system is fm at low temperatures only up to @xmath36 , for a hole concentration of 1/3.@xcite the conclusion is twofold : i ) @xmath34 is not a very tunable parameter and , ii ) la@xmath2ca@xmath3mno@xmath6 is a rather critical system where small perturbations can produce large changes in physical properties .    therefore , it is a challenge to this model to give account of the experimental situation of the double series ( [ dobleserie ] ) in the range @xmath12 @xcite , without stretching out the values of @xmath37 already determined.@xcite    through the whole series ( [ dobleserie ] ) , only the mn @xmath24 ( up ) band is electronically active , with the electron hopping between mn@xmath26 and mn@xmath38 . in the fe case , the fe @xmath24 ( up ) band",
    "is completely filled and electron hopping from mn@xmath26 to fe@xmath26 is forbidden .",
    "the situation is similar when tr = al@xmath26 or ga@xmath26 , in which cases the d - band is full .",
    "this means that the fraction of mn@xmath38 with respect to the amount of mn@xmath26+mn@xmath38 is incresed by a factor @xmath39 respect to the case @xmath15 .",
    "figure 2 of ref .",
    "shows that , as far as the the following argument is concerned , the curie temperature , @xmath40 does not depend much on the hole density around 40% of carriers .",
    "this will allow us to extrapolate the results for tr = fe from our previous computations .",
    "in fact , the similar ionic radii of fe@xmath26 and mn@xmath26 means that lattice distortion effects may be ignored .",
    "thus , let us explore the hypothesis that the substitution of mn for fe affects only the antiferromagnetic interaction between the localized spins , besides the irrelevant in this case @xmath39 factor in the effective number of holes .",
    "this change is due to the arising of mn - mn , mn - fe , and fe - fe couplings , with probability @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "given that the core spins are 3/2 for mn and 5/2 for fe , the effective value of the super - exchange constant is @xmath44\\ , , \\label{jeff}\\ ] ] thus , we can easily extrapolate the results of fig . 3 of ref .   for @xmath45 to the case of fe substitution ( we took @xmath46 @xcite ) , where we get @xmath47 for @xmath48 , what implies that @xmath49 ( see fig .  3 of ref .  ) , in complete agreement both with the experimental data of ref .   as well as with the phenomenological analysis of a. tzavellas",
    "et al._. @xcite",
    "on the other hand , when tr in ( [ dobleserie ] ) is al or ga , lattice distortion effects enhance the relevance of the fact that on the mn sites the charge is a mixture of + 3 and + 4 .",
    "in fact , as we will see , electrostatic effects yielding diagonal disorder in our model turn out to be crucial not only to understand the known experimental facts,@xcite but also to produce a new and very interesting physical situation for values of @xmath19 not studied in ref .  .",
    "the effects of ga doping in the colossal magnetoresistance materials la@xmath2ca@xmath3mno@xmath6 , has been recently studied by preparing the series la@xmath2ca@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 ( @xmath50),@xcite and a strong decrease of @xmath40 with growing @xmath19 was reported .",
    "however , the doping fraction never went beyond 10% , while we believe that a qcp will appear for @xmath51@xmath52 .",
    "no structural change upon doping was observed,@xcite nor it is to be expected for larger ga fraction , because it does not occur in the laga@xmath5mn@xmath4o@xmath6 series .",
    "the model used here does not take into account the orbital degeneracy in the @xmath24 band .",
    "thus , strictly speaking it ceases to be valid when the ratio mn@xmath38/mn@xmath26 approaches unity , which , in this case , corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "nevertheless we use the results for @xmath19 up to 0.4 in order to describe better the change in physical properties due to the transition .    the ga substitution _ disorders _ the system ( details are given below ) . in order to describe specifically a disorder effect",
    ", we will need a _",
    "disordered model_.@xcite the standard way of constructing a disordered model is to choose first a simple model able to describe the ordered situation ( i.e. the system with no gallium ) , and then to mimic the inclusion of impurities in the real system by the random modification of some terms in the hamiltonian that reflect the microscopic effects of the impurity . as said in the previous subsection our reference _ ordered _ model , is the single orbital double - exchange model ( dem ) on the cubic lattice of eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) .    with an ordered model in our hands",
    ", we can discuss the effects of gallium doping .",
    "given that the sizes of mn and ga are not very different , one expects small changes in the angles , and therefore , on the values of the couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 . to keep the model simple",
    "we shall assume that the parameter @xmath34 and @xmath33 are not modified at all by ga substitution . since the series laga@xmath5mn@xmath4o@xmath6 exist for all @xmath19 , we expect ga to be in a ga@xmath26 oxidation state , which is a filled - shell configuration .",
    "this means that the corresponding @xmath24 orbital will not be available for a hole in a neighboring mn to hop , which reduces the double - exchange ( de ) ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "we thus encounter a quantum - percolation problem ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "however , quantum - percolation studies have shown that the quantum threshold is not far from the classical one ( that would be reached at 69% ga fraction ! ) , and this effect is not expected to be crucial . moreover , given the filled - shell configuration of ga , the mn@xmath26 core spin @xmath54 will disappear from ga - sites , which reduces also the afm interaction that competes with the de ferromagnetic one . in the case of ga , the effective af coupling of eq .",
    "( [ jeff ] ) is @xmath55 which , for instance , for @xmath48 turns out to be 0.77 @xmath37 .",
    "this is really a huge reduction ( see fig .  3 of ref .   and fig .  3 of ref .  ) , and it is not obvious what the effect of ga substitution on the curie temperature would be .",
    "fortunately , the effects of ga substitution described so far can be straightforwardly studied with the vmf method,@xcite and it turns out that the reduction on the antiferromagnetic interaction has an stronger effect than the reduction of the de mechanism , and @xmath40 _ rises _ in the model when the ga fraction is increased . since this is in plain contradiction with experiments,@xcite it is clear that our microscopic description of the ga substitution is still incomplete .",
    "this suggests that an on - site electrostatic perturbation is induced by ga ions in eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "this electrostatic term can be justified by the fact that the average charge on ga sites is always @xmath56 while on mn sites it is a mixture of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore holes can not hop onto ga sites , but they are attracted to them .",
    "we expect this phenomenon to be more relevant in the case of ga than in the case of fe .",
    "in fact , if in a cubic lattice of mn ions we substitute a fraction @xmath19 of mn by tr randomly , the electrostatic potential that appears in the mn sites is proportional to the number of tr@xmath26 that are neighbors of the considered mn ion .",
    "let us call @xmath58 the electrostatic potential felt by a hole at a mn site with only a neighboring tr .",
    "in the fe case , @xmath58 is the same on each mn site because lattice distortion effects can be ignored , ought to the similar ionic radii of fe@xmath26 and mn@xmath26 .",
    "however , in the ga case ( and even more in the al case ) , the ionic radii difference implies that to the randomness in the distribution is added the randomness originated by the lattice distortion which , among other phenomena , makes the potential randomly dependent on the mn position .    to avoid an overly complicated model",
    ", we incorporate the second disorder to the first one ( of lifshitz type ) and we work with an effective @xmath58 , the same for all mn sites .",
    "consequently , the @xmath58 is larger for ga and al than for fe ; this is precisely what the experimental data require @xcite since , as we have said , without a localization mechanism that destroys the double exchange , @xmath40 would rise with @xmath19 .",
    "as we will see , a moderate disorder ( from our analysis , @xmath59 ) modifies only slightly the decrease of @xmath40 with @xmath19 .",
    "for this reason we have neglected it in the case of fe .    in summary ,",
    "our model for la@xmath2ca@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 is as follows : every ga atom modifies the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) in the following ways :    1 .",
    "holes can not hop onto ga .",
    "therefore the average number of one third of a hole per unit cell , actually means that the fraction of mn@xmath38 is increased with respect to the case @xmath15 by a factor .",
    "2 .   the core spins vanish at the ga sites .",
    "3 .   a electrostatic",
    "potential appears on the mn sites , proportional to the number of ga@xmath26 that are nearest - neighbors of the considered mn site .",
    "we have studied our disordered model using the vmf technique,@xcite which is approximate for the spins , but treat charge carriers on each spin texture exactly ( up to controlled numerical errors ) . the hybrid monte carlo study  @xcite has shown that the vmf overestimates the critical temperature by a 30% , which is the same overestimation factor found in classical statistical mechanics three - dimensional models with short range interactions . in the particular case of a disordered model , the vmf technique has the important merit of allowing the study of very large clusters ( @xmath60 in this work ) .",
    "the self - averaging nature of the electronic density of states makes thus unnecessary to average our results over disorder realizations , which instead would be mandatory in a monte carlo study where the study of a single @xmath61 cluster is at the very limit of present day computers and algorithms.@xcite in order to make the study as unbiased as possible , we shall consider as vmf ansatzs all the spin orderings that were found in the monte carlo study of model in the absence of disorder,@xcite namely fm , g - afm , a - afm , c - afm , skyrmion ( sk ) , flux , twisted and island phases .    ) , and several values of the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the curves are normalized to a maximum of @xmath62 holes per unit cell , and the fermi level is obtained integrating the dos until reaching one third of a hole per unit cell . ]    to gain some insight on the physics of our model , it is useful to consider ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) the hole density of states ( dos)@xcite for the fully fm spin - polarized system with a 20% ga substitution , upon variation of the electrostatic parameter @xmath58 . for @xmath63",
    ", we have the usual dos of the cubic lattice , slightly contracted and smoothed by the percolative disorder ( holes can not jump onto a ga ) .",
    "we have a sharp contribution at midband , due to the localized states produced by the rare configurations of mn sites fully surrounded by ga sites ( thereafter this very rare configurations were taken out by hand ) .",
    "if the electrostatic potential at a given site is large enough ( in a mn site with @xmath64 neighboring ga , it is @xmath65 ) , a hole state of energy @xmath66 will get localized in this mn site , as the reader can check in fig .",
    "this effect can be investigated within the small defect - density expansion,@xcite where @xmath58 is allowed to be arbitrarily large .",
    "it turns out that a localized state will form if @xmath65 is larger than the edge of the @xmath63 dos.@xcite therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] tells us that for @xmath67 , a mn site should have at least three neighboring ga to trap a hole on it , while for @xmath68 it is enough to have two neighboring ga ( mn sites with two neighboring ga sites are deceivingly common , even for modest values of @xmath19 , because of the large combinatorial factor ) .",
    "the electrostatic potential tends also to localize the electronic states even near to the edges of the main part of the dos , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( for @xmath69 the fermi level is very close to the edge of the main part of the dos ) .",
    "the calculations show that the double exchange interaction is strongly suppressed when holes occupy these localized states , leading to a decrease in the value of the @xmath40 .",
    "we find that the drop in @xmath40 upon ga doping is best reproduced using @xmath70 , and , considering our earlier results for manganites with a perfect mn lattice,@xcite we take @xmath71@xmath72 . on the other hand , for @xmath73 disorder",
    "is not the main agent of the eventual decrease of @xmath40 as @xmath19 increases ( as happens in the case tr = fe ) .",
    ", as function of @xmath34 , for two values of the ga concentration , @xmath19 .",
    "top : @xmath15 .",
    "bottom : @xmath74 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the phase diagram of model ( [ hamil ] ) , for 1/3 hole concentration , in the cases of @xmath15 ( top ) and @xmath74 ( bottom ) mn  ga substitution .",
    "the very narrow phase - separation regions at @xmath74 are left unlabelled for clarity . in agreement with the expected role of disorder near a discontinuous transition ,",
    "ga substitution induces a wedge of pm phase , down to the lowest temperatures , between phases with different types of long range magnetic order . in the @xmath35@xmath72 @xmath37 range",
    "the sk and a - afm phases are virtually degenerate . between the a and c phases we find tiny regions of phase - separation , @xmath75 island phase and twisted orderings .",
    "notice that the vmf assumes that the spin structure is spatially homogeneous , overestimating the tendency towards first order transitions in the disordered system .",
    "thus , the results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] strongly suggest ( see below ) the existence of a continuous transition at all temperatures , in the ga doped system .    , including @xmath76 ( la@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 ) and @xmath77@xmath72 ( la@xmath2ca@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 ) , as predicted by our model .",
    "top : phase - diagram for electrostatic potential @xmath78 . ]    in figure  [ fig3 ] ( bottom ) we show the phase diagram of our model , for four values of @xmath34 , namely @xmath76 , which is a reasonable value for la@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 at least for @xmath15,@xcite @xmath79 that marks the change from second to first order character of the pm - fm transition , and @xmath77@xmath72 which we believe is an appropriate range for la@xmath2ca@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "there are several points to be noted .",
    "first , see how at @xmath15 , the different values of @xmath34 are enough to explain the 30% differences in @xmath40 between la@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath6 and la@xmath2ca@xmath3mno@xmath6 .",
    "as we see , for la@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 , @xmath80 , we have a more or less monotonous decreases of the @xmath81 , the ground - state being fm in all the interesting @xmath19 range . on the other hand ,",
    "the scenario is completely different for la@xmath2ca@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 ( @xmath77 and @xmath72 ) . in this case",
    ", the fm ordering disappears for @xmath82@xmath52 , where the pm phase is stable until the lowest temperatures . _ for larger values of @xmath19 a very complicated situation is reached with different , almost degenerated phases_. this region might look somehow glassy experimentally . the ordering temperature in the large @xmath19 region is about one order of magnitude smaller than for @xmath15 .",
    "more remarkably , for @xmath19 larger than @xmath83 , the spins are not completely polarized even at zero temperature ( technically , this means that the mean - field at low temperature is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a large but not infinite constant  @xcite ) , and , also at zero temperature , the magnetization in the fm phase decrease upon approaching @xmath83 although it does not get below @xmath86 polarization .",
    "this effect will be amplified by the neglected quantum fluctuations of the spins , especially at very low temperatures .",
    "thus , _ given the wedge of pm phase that reaches near zero temperature at @xmath83 and our underestimation of quantum fluctuations , it seems fairly plausible that a quantum critical point will be found in _ la@xmath2ca@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 _",
    ", for @xmath74@xmath52_. in order to emphasize how crucial the electrostatic attraction of holes to the ga sites is , let us show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( top ) , the equivalent of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( bottom ) , for @xmath67 . in this case , the system is ferromagnetic in all the explored range @xmath87 , in agreement with the scarcity of localized states shown in fig .",
    "in this work we have accomplished a systematic study of doped manganites begun in previous papers and formulated a microscopically motivated disordered model to study the effects of ga substitution in la@xmath2ca@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "we have studied this model using the vmf technique in @xmath60 clusters .",
    "a result of this work is the prediction that a qcp is expected to appear for @xmath82@xmath52 , which is induced by anderson localization of the electronic states below the fermi level that suppresses the double exchange mechanism .",
    "thus , we expect localization effects in the transport properties at low temperatures , where phonons are static ( _ i.e _ polarons could exist  @xcite , but they would play the same role of our @xmath58 diagonal static disorder term ) . for larger values of @xmath19 ,",
    "a different phase is reached which is difficult to analyze because many different phases are almost degenerate .",
    "nevertheless one can conclude safely that the ordering temperature for @xmath88 will be in the 20 to 40 k range .",
    "it is worth noting that the main features of the predicted phase - diagram are in quantitative agreement with preliminary experimental work.@xcite    a completely different behavior is expected for la@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 . in such case the localization phenomenon that can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath68 , besides to the results of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] corresponding to @xmath89 , strongly suggest that the fact that holes are localized does not necessarily imply that the long range magnetism disappears ; in fact , to maintain it , it is enough that effective ferromagnetic interactions between close spins remain .",
    "hence , for la@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 we expect a fmmetal - fminsulator transition at low temperatures ( see also ref .  ) .    in the ga case , it is worthwhile to remark that in our model , which considers spins coupled to charge carriers , the localization transition determines the magnetic critical exponents too .",
    "experimentally , it is very promising that one be able to study a localization transition through a magnetic order parameter .",
    "if there is really a qcp for @xmath21@xmath52,@xcite there would be presumably only one characteristic length in the system , which would set the scale both of the magnetic and transport phenomena .      finally , it is worth noting that the model used in this work includes the simplest combination of interactions compatible with the experimental data for the manganites , in the absence of ga doping .",
    "the confirmation of the predictions proposed here for ga doped materials can illustrate the usefulness of simple models in studying the phase diagram of these compounds .",
