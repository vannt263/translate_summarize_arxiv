    "an equivalence class , or a diagram in this equivalent class , is called a _ virtual knot_. we can also define a virtual knot as an embedding of a circle into a thickened surface . if a virtual knot can be modified into the unknot by generalized reidemeiter moves and crossing changes then we say that the virtual knot is _ virtually null - homotopic_. here a _ crossing change _ is an operation which replaces an overstand at a classical crossing into an understrand .",

    "there are several unknotting operations for virtual knots .",
    "for example , an operation which replaces a classical crossing of a diagram of a virtual knot by a virtual crossing is called a _ virtualization _ , and any virtual knot can be modified into the unknot by applying virtualizations successively .",

    "recently , in  @xcite , kaur , kamada , kawauchi and prabhakar introduced the notion of the generalized unknotting number of a virtual knot as follows : for any virtual knot diagram , there exists a sequence of virtualizations and crossing changes such that the virtual knot is modified into a virtual knot diagram virtually homotopic to the unknot .",
