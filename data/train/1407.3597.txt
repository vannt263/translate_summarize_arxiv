    "the differential equation    @xmath1    where @xmath2 denotes the differentiation w.r.t . @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the unknown ( real ) function , was introduced by s.srinivasan  @xcite in a number - theoretic context involving certain discrete sums.(he uses the notation @xmath5 instead of @xmath4 ) .",
    "our main aim is to study this diffrential equation from the dynamical systems point of view and describe all its orbits .",
    "it turns out that this equation has close resemblance with the unforced , undamped pendulum equation @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , simmons and krantz  @xcite . ) unlike the pendulum equation , the equation ( [ 1 ] ) exhibits solutions in explicit form for all possible initial data .",
    "specifically , we show that the orbits of this equation are periodic iff @xmath7 the apparent singular nature of the equation in the form of the coefficient of the highest order derivative term , namely , @xmath0 , is resolved in an interesting way and we do obtain smooth solutions in explicit form .",
    "+ rewrite the equation ( [ 1 ] ) as    @xmath8    we consider the initial value problem by imposing the appropriate initial conditions @xmath9 the equation ( [ 2 ] ) is an autonomous equation , but not in the conservative form .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to describe the orbits of solutions of ( [ 2 ] ) in the @xmath10 plane , _ the phase plane _ , for all the possible initial data .",
    "+ looking at the coefficient of @xmath0 in ( [ 2 ] ) , we observe that it is essential to take @xmath11 and @xmath12 we will now make several observations regarding the solutions of ( [ 2 ] ) and make the necessary conditions on the initial data @xmath13    1 .",
    "the equlibrium points of the equation are @xmath14 with @xmath15 an integer .",
    "if @xmath4 is a solution , so is @xmath16 3 .",
    "the line @xmath17 in the phase plane is an orbit of the equation , i.e. , @xmath18 is a solution of the equation for any @xmath19    therefore , the orbits with @xmath20 remain in the region @xmath21 in the @xmath10 phase palne .",
    "see , also , ( [ e ] ) below . + with these observations , we assume the following conditions on the initial data :    @xmath22 ) has periodic solutions only when @xmath23 the orbits in this case are periodic orbits surrounding the origin in the phase plane and are symmetric w.r.t . @xmath24 axis .",
    "if @xmath25 then there is an increasing real sequence @xmath26 whose elements are the roots of a trigonometric equation , with @xmath27 the smallest positive root , such that the solution @xmath4 satisfies @xmath28 an odd integer multiple of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all @xmath31 + the equation and the energy equation(([e ] ) , derived below ) are satisfied at these points in the sense of limit @xmath32 + the orbits in this case oscillate in the phase plane around the interface line @xmath33 line , in the strip between the lines @xmath34 and @xmath35.(incidentally , @xmath36 is the harmonic mean of @xmath37 and @xmath38 the crossing of the interface line occurs exactly at points corresponding to @xmath39    in either case , the solution has an explicit form .",
    "the proof is a consequence of various relations derived in what follows and many computations done below .",
    "+ * remark * the case @xmath40 is similar to the case of pendulum equation for small total energy and that of @xmath41 for large total energy .",
    "see , simmons and krantz @xcite .",
    "+ linearizing around an equilibrium point @xmath42 by writing @xmath43 with @xmath44 small , the linearized equation is @xmath45 and hence the equlibrium point @xmath46 is linearly stable but not asymptotically stable .",
    "assuming @xmath47 we may rewrite the equation ( [ 2 ] ) as @xmath48 multiplying this by @xmath24 and integrating once yields    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is a constant .",
    "in analogy with a conservative equation , we call this the `` energy '' equation",
    ". this energy equation will be used to describe the orbits of the equation and also find the solutions in explicit form . in the process , we also learn how to handle the apparent singularity arising in the equation in the coefficient of @xmath51 + first note that from the initial data , we have @xmath52 it immediately follows that , using ( [ i ] ) , @xmath53 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 and the sign of @xmath57 is the same as the sign of @xmath58 thus proving the remark made above regarding the orbits of solutions .",
    "+ taking the @xmath59 term the other side and adding and substracting @xmath60 to the numerator term on the left side of ( [ e ] ) , we obtain @xmath61 using ( [ e ] ) , we now describe the phase portrait of orbits in the phase plane .",
    "+ suppose @xmath62 then @xmath63 and therefore the @xmath64 values are restricted to a symmetrtic interval @xmath65 $ ] around @xmath66 with @xmath67 satisfying @xmath68 consequently , the values of @xmath24 are also restricted to a finite interval @xmath69,$ ] determined by the energy equation . using ( [ e ] ) we obtain that @xmath70 with @xmath71 sign if @xmath72 and @xmath73 sign if @xmath74 + this enables us to draw a phase portrait in this case .",
    "thus , we obtain a periodic orbit around the equilibrium point @xmath75 traversing clockwise indicating the direction of increasing @xmath76    next , suppose @xmath77 and @xmath12 in this case we have @xmath55 and therefore , there is no restriction on @xmath4 values and @xmath4 is an increasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "hence the solutions are unbounded in this case . in this case",
    "we have , @xmath78 with @xmath71 sign if @xmath79 and @xmath73 sign if @xmath80 + using ( [ e2 ] ) , we can now complete the phase portarit in this case and we find that the orbit oscillates between the lines @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the phase plane , crossing the interface line @xmath33 at the points where @xmath4 is an odd integer multiple of @xmath83 + because of the apparent singularity in the equation at those @xmath3 where @xmath84 is an odd integer multiple of @xmath29 and @xmath85 we will explain the sense in which the equation is satisfied at such @xmath3 once we obtain the solution in explicit form and see that this singularity does not cause any difficulty .",
    "we now perform an integration of the enrgy relation to obtain the solution in explicit form .",
    "looking at the energy relation , it is convenient to introduce the variable @xmath86 we then obtain the following equation taking the positive sign in ( [ e1 ] ) or ( [ e2 ] ) ( the other cases being similar ) ,    @xmath87    integrating this equation and making use of addition formula for @xmath88 function we obtain , after some algebra ,    @xmath89    here @xmath90 and @xmath91 we note the following relation connecting @xmath92 and @xmath50 , which is used in computations that follow .",
    "we have ,    @xmath93    we may rewrite ( [ d ] ) as    @xmath94    though ( [ x ] ) gives the solution in the explicit form , it will be difficult to see whether the solution is periodic or not because of the presence of @xmath95 we now obtain the following explicit formula for @xmath24 , using ( [ x ] ) , which will be used to decide the periodicity of the solution easily and also in further analysis .",
    "we have :    @xmath96    note that the denominator in ( [ xd ] ) is positive being the sum of two square terms @xmath97 these two terms can not simultaneouly vanish because of our assumption ( [ i ] ) .",
    "this also implies that the terms in the numerator and denominator of the expression for @xmath98 in ( [ x ] ) do not vanish simultaneously . from ( [ xd ] )",
    ", we again observe that the sign of @xmath99 is solely determined by the sign of @xmath100 + it is not hard to verify the energy relation using the above expressions for @xmath98 and @xmath101 + we now show how to use the above expression for @xmath24 to decide when the solution @xmath4 will be periodic , with the aid of the following simple lemma , which is straight forward to prove . +",

    "we now analyse whether a solution @xmath4 takes the value @xmath29 or an odd integer multiple of it , in finite time and how to handle that situation .",
    "+ referring to ( [ x ] ) , we see that this is possible only if the denominator in ( [ x ] ) vanishes",
    ". this vanishing condition will be determined by ( [ d ] ) or ( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "+   + we have @xmath53 and ( [ d1 ] ) then implies that @xmath114 so that @xmath115 therefore , the denominator in ( [ x ] ) never vanishes and , since it is positive at @xmath116 it is positive for all @xmath76 this observation reconfirms the earlier statement made on the boundedness of the solutions .",
    "+   + now , since @xmath117 ( [ d ] ) implies @xmath118 therefore the denominator in ( [ x ] ) now vanishes at finite @xmath119 which are the roots of the trigonometric equation @xmath120 we may fix @xmath27 to be the smallest positive solution .",
    "thus , @xmath121 is an odd integer multiple of @xmath29 and from the expression for @xmath122 we see that @xmath123 these values precisely correspond to the singularities in the equation ( [ 1 ] ) or ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we now write down an explicit expression for the solution by an integration of the expression ( [ xd ] ) for @xmath101 + note that the integral of the secod term in the expression for @xmath24 involves @xmath88 function containg @xmath124 function in arguments . therefore",
    ", a little care is required to write this expression .",
    "let @xmath125 denote the ( indefinite ) integral of this second term .",
    "we have @xmath126 \\tan ( t/2 ) - 4(1-b)a}{4 |2b-1| \\cos^2 a } \\right ) ,    & \\text{if $ |t| < \\pi$ } \\\\",

    "+ we have @xmath133 and @xmath134 and @xmath135 is given by @xmath136 @xmath135 is then extended for all real @xmath3 as before .",
    "the expressions for @xmath137 are given by @xmath138    in the expression for @xmath4 , @xmath71 is chosen when @xmath139 and @xmath73 is chosen when @xmath140 these expressions may be used to obtain more information about the integral mentioned in @xcite .",
    "+ we remark that the phase portraits may also be easily drawn using the above expressions for @xmath4 and @xmath122 which give a parametric representation of the orbit .",
    "a few orbits are depicted in the following two figures with @xmath141 ( figure @xmath36 ) and @xmath142 ( figure @xmath143 ) respectively . in these figures",
    "@xmath144 +        * remark : * for the differential equation @xmath145 the energy equation is given by @xmath146 with @xmath50 a constant expressed in terms of the initial data .",
    "using this energy equation we can do a similar phase plane analysis as above and obtain a complete phase portrait . since an expression for @xmath24 can not be obtained , no further integration of the energy equation is possible and as such we will not be able to obtain the solutions in explicit form .",
    "the equilibrium points are again @xmath147 with @xmath15 an integer .",
    "a simple linear analysis shows that each equilibrium point is linearly unstable and is of saddle type .",
    "thus , by hartman - grobman theorem , the same behaviour locally persists for the nonlinear equation also .",
