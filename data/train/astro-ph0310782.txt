    "there are several models of planetary nebulae which describe that the ionization structure and other physical characteristics ( hjellming 1966 , rubin 1968 , harrington 1968 , 1969 , kirkpatrick 1970 , 1972 , koppen 1979 , 1980 ) .",
    "they calculated the ionization structure by solving simultaneously , the equations of radiative transfer and ionization equilibrium for several elements such as h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , s , ar etc . in different stages of ionization together with the energy equilibrium equation .",
    "the ionization equilibrium equation requires the use of the radiation in the form of mean intensity .",
    "normally mean intensity obtained by the ` on the spot approximation ' is utilized in evaluating the formation of hydrogen ly @xmath1 line in dusty , expanding planetary nebulae .",
    "infrared observations of planetary nebulae have established in the presence of dust ( like graphite , amorphous carbon , silicate , and iron ) in these objects and a comprehensive review work up to 1982 has been presented by barlow ( 1983 ) .",

    "( 1984 ) found infrared excesses in high dust temperature nebulae .",
    "they concluded the possibility of dust being mostly heated by the radiation of the central star on the long wave side since the nebulae are young .",
    "ratag et al .",
    "( 1990 ) suggested that the infrared excesses was due to the dust contents or heating by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "amnuel ( 1994 ) favored the latter explanation .",
    "peraiah and wehrse ( 1978 ) found that the mean intensities of the radiation field are far different from those obtained from the ` on the spot approximation ' .",
    "the expansion in the nebulae would certainly modify the radiation field and this radiation field in tern changes the ionization structure in the nebulae .",
    "however , a complete and rigorous analysis by incorporating relevant theory for dust scattering in an expanding medium is not explored . in this paper",
    "we investigate the changes that are produced on the radiation field by the radially expanding gases and dust . for this purpose",
    ", we develop the solution of radiative transfer equation in the expanding nebulae .",
    "we assume both gas and dust with hydrogen and helium as the components of the gas . in section 2",

    "the terminal velocity @xmath47 is considered to be 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 , 100 and 300 kms@xmath49 .    the distribution of total density comes from the equation of continuity and is written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the rate of mass loss . since the particle number density in planetary nebulae ranges from 0.1 to 100 @xmath52 ,",
    "we have set @xmath53 m@xmath54yr@xmath49 .",
    "the number density of he is taken to be 0.1 times that of h.    the dust - to - gas mass ratio for ic 418 and ngc 7662 are derived by hoare ( 1990 ) to be @xmath55 and @xmath0 respectively . in our model",
    "we have taken dust - to - gas mass ratio as @xmath56 .",
    "it is generally believed that dust in planetary nebula is carbon based one such as graphite .",
    "however , observation at infrared reveals the presence of silicates ( stasinska & szczerba 1999 ; pottasch 1987 ) .",
    "thus , we consider silicate type grains to demonstrate the effect of forward scattering . now",
    "both the real and the imaginary refractive index for silicate grains are function of frequency and they depend on the grain composition .",
    "the real part of the refractive index for magnesium silicates such as forsterite and enstetite varies from 1.55 to 0.8 while the imaginary part varies from 0.85 to 0.3 ( scott & duley 1996 ) in the frequency interval we have considered in the present work . for the sake of simplicity , in the present work we have taken an average value of the refractive indices for all the freequency points . the real part of the refractive index is taken to be 1.2 while the imaginary part is set at 0.5 for all frequency points . we have assumed same kind and size of spherical dust particles with radius 0.1 and 0.5 micron . it is worth mentioning that the mie phase function reduces to that of rayleigh when the ratio of the particle size to the wavelength is very small .",
    "mie scattering is asymmetric in the sense that the forward scattering and the backward scattering are not the same while rayleigh scattering is symmetric .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath57 is given by ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the scattering efficiency and @xmath60 denotes the complex conjugate . in fig  1 , we present the asymmetry parameter for different frequency points with grain radii 0.1 @xmath61 and 0.5@xmath61 .",
    "for rayleigh scattering , @xmath62 because of symmetry .",
    "if the particle scatters more light toward the forward direction then g is positive while g is negative if the scattering is directed more toward the back direction .",
    "although , the dust sizes considered is very small , the wavelength range that we are concerned is much shorter than the particle radius . as a consequence ,",
    "g is positive in all frequency points considered in the present work . the numerical value of g very near to + 1 implies that the particles scatter light mostly in the forward direction . for a given frequnecy point",
    "the asymmetry increases as the particle size increases . on the other hand , for a given particle size",
    ", the asymmetry increases as the frequency increases .",
    "however , the asymmetry parameter depends on the refractive index as well . with the increase in the refractive index , the absorbity of the particle increases .",
    "fig  1 shows that g is almost constant with the particle radius 0.5 @xmath61 .",
    "when the imaginary part of the refractive index is decreased from 0.5 to as small as 0.02 , g increases with the increase in frequency and saturates at much higher value .",
    "the asymmetry parameter for different size of graphite grains is presented by draine ( 1985 ) . the mie scattering and extinction cross - sections for astronomical silicates",
    "have been discussed in details by draine & lee ( 1984 ) . at large value of @xmath43 , the extinction efficiency @xmath63 approaches to 2.0 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the dust opacity plays dominant role over the phase function in determining the emergent flux .",
    "the solution of radiative transfer in spherical symmetry ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is developed by using discrete space theory of radiative transfer ( pg73 ) . in general",
    "the following steps are followed for obtaining the solution .",
    "\\(i ) we divide the medium into a number of `` cells '' whose thickness is less than or equal to the critical @xmath64 .",
    "the critical thickness is determined on the basis of physical characteristics of the medium .",
    "@xmath65 ensures the stability and uniqueness of the solution .",
    "\\(ii ) now the integration of the transfer equation is performed on the `` cell '' which is two - dimensional radius - angle grid bounded by @xmath66 \\times [ \\mu_{j-\\frac { 1}{2 } } , \\mu_{j+\\frac { 1}{2}}]$ ] where @xmath67= @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are the weights of gauss legendre formula .",
    "\\(iii ) by using the interaction principle described in pg73 , we obtain the reflection and transmission operators over the `` cell '' .",

    "as the purpose of this paper is to show the qualitative changes introduced by curvature and expansion . we have chosen harrington s ( 1969 ) model of ngc 7662 given in osterbrock ( 1974 , page 135 ) .",
    "few discrete points in the frequency grid are considered starting @xmath19 hz to about four times this frequency .",
    "we have divided this frequency interval into 20 points equally distributed along the grid .",
    "the mean intensity is calculated by using the relation @xmath100    the results are presented in figure 2 - 5 .",
    "figure 2 shows the mean intensity without the effect of dust scattering and absorption .",
    "the mean intensity increases with the increase in the velocity .",
    "the change in the mean intensity is maximum when the terminal velocity @xmath47 is increased from 10 kms@xmath49 to 20 kms@xmath49 .",
    "expansion of the medium yields the atmosphere diluted by decreasing the density .",
    "hence more photons can escape from the bottom of the atmosphere . as a result , the mean intensity increases with the increase in velocity . for a dust - free atmosphere ,",
    "the opacity is determined by the absorption cross section of hydrogen and helium . the absorption cross section for hydrogen varies with the cube of the frequency while that for helium changes exponentially . for small expansion velocity",
    "the mean intensity falls slowly with the increase in frequency up to @xmath101 hz but then falls rapidly .",
    "this means the optical depth with small velocity is mainly governed by the change in the hydrogen opacity .",
    "however , the helium opacity starts dominating as the frequency increases from @xmath101 hz .",
    "when the velocity increases , the mean intensity increases with the increase in frequency and peaks at about @xmath102 hz and then falls rapidly .",
    "the change in the qualitative feature of the mean intensity with the increase in velocity is dictated by the change in the absorption cross - section while the increase in the intensity is due to the dilution of the medium .    with the incorporation of dust grains ,",
    "there are significant qualitative as well as quantitative changes in the mean intensities as can be seen from figure 3 to figure 5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in a dusty atmosphere the optical depth is determined mainly by the dust .",
    "the absorption and scattering by dust are determined by the size and the refractive index of the grains . in the present investigation",
    "we have considered dust grain with sizes 0.1 @xmath61 and 0.5 @xmath61 .",
    "given the high temperature of the medium , grains with larger size would not survive .",
    "since the wavelengths under consideration is shorter than 0.1 @xmath61 , scattering by dust plays a significant role in determining the mean intensity .",
    "it is well known that rayleigh scattering is symmetric so that the amount of forward and backward scattering is the same .",
    "but , mie scattering is asymmetric and it makes the forward scattering more than the backward scattering as discussed in section 4 .",
    "this asymmetry increases as the ratio between the wavelength and the particle size increases . in a dust free clear atmosphere",
    ", a significant amount of radiation gets back scattered contributing to the reduction in mean intensity .",
    "but , dust scattering makes a large number of photons scattered in the forward direction yielding an increase in the mean intensity as compared to that without dust . with the adopted values for the wavelength and the particle size , dust scattering dominates over dust absorption . as a result ,",
    "increase in mean intensity is obtained when dust is incorporated in the atmospheric models .",
    "the mean intensity increases with the increase in praticle size as the asymmetry increases with the increase in particle size .",
    "it is worth noting that the mean intensity for two different sizes of dust particles is the same for smaller frequency or longer wavelength and the changes in the mean intensity increases as one moves from smaller to larger frequencies .",
    "the mean intensity from a planetary nebulae with expanding atmosphere is modeled by solving the radiative transfer equations for multiple scattering . both dusty and dust - free",
    "medium is considered . for the dusty medium , mie theory of scattering by spherical dust grains",
    "is employed . in a dust - free atmosphere , the mean intensity increases with the increase in the expansion velocity as the expansion of the medium removes matter causing a decrease in optical depth .",
    "the entire intensity profile changes when dust scattering is incorporated . due to the increase in forward scattering of photon by dust grains ,",
    "the mean intensity increases significantly in a dusty medium as compared to that in a dust - free atmosphere . also , the mean intensity increases with the increase in particle size .",
    "thus it is shown that both the expansion and the presence of dust in the atmosphere of planetary nebulae play important role in determining the mean intensity of the object .",
    "the important implication of the present work is that even the presence of very small dust grain would affect the spectrum of planetary nebulae at the ultra - violet and near optical region",
    ". therefore observation at shorter wavelengths would provide important information on the properties of dust grains as well as the velocity field .",
