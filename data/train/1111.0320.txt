    "the fermi gamma - ray space telescope was launched on june 11 , 2008 .",
    "its main instrument , the large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) , observes the entire sky every @xmath03 hours ( 2 orbits ) with a field of view covering @xmath02.4 sr and a sensitive energy range extending from 20mev to @xmath1300gev @xcite .",
    "these properties make the fermi - lat an excellent instrument for dark matter ( dm ) searches .",
    "one of the leading dm candidates is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "the gamma - ray flux from self - annihilating wimps can be expressed as @xmath2 ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite , see also @xcite for a review ) , where @xmath3 is the `` particle physics factor '' described by @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the `` astrophysical factor '' , or j - factor , described by @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the ( velocity - averaged ) wimp annihilation cross section times relative velocity , @xmath8 is the wimp mass , @xmath9 is the gamma - ray energy distribution per annihilation , and @xmath10 is the dark matter density distribution .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) are considered to be dm dominated systems since they have a very high mass to light ratio .",
    "they are near - by ( @xmath11 and they have low background since most dsphs are expected to be free from other astrophysical gamma - ray sources and they have a small gas content .",
    "this makes them interesting targets for gamma - ray dm searches .",
    "however , the expected flux from dm annihilation or decay for dsphs are expected to be very low .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration has recently presented results from a dm search in a number of dsphs @xcite . in this work",
    "we perform a joint likelihood analysis , taking advantage of the fact that the dm spectra are the same in all targets .",
    "we present results considering ten dsphs taking into account the uncertainties in the astrophysical factors .",
    "the results presented in these proceedings are updated with respect to the preliminary results presented at the conference .",
    "this work was initially presented in @xcite , and final results are presented in @xcite .",
    ".position , distance , and j - factor ( under assumption of a navarro - frenk - white profile ) of each dsph .",
    "the 4th column shows the mode of the posterior distribution of @xmath12 , and the 5th column indicates its 68% c.l .",
    "see the text for further details .",
    "the j - factors correspond to the pair annihilation flux coming from a cone of solid angle @xmath13 sr .",
    "the final column indicates the reference for the kinematic dataset used .",
    "[ dwarfs ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have observed ten dsphs , listed in table [ dwarfs ] , which is the same set of dwarfs for which annihilation cross section limits were presented in @xcite with the addition of carina and segue 1 , using 24 months of data . we have used the diffuse event class which only contains the events with the highest gamma - like confidence , and we have chosen events ranging from 200  mev to 100  gev . we used the fermi - lat instrument responce function p6@xmath14v3@xmath14diffuse .",
    "our region of interest ( roi ) is a region of 10 degrees radius centered on dsph location .",
    "standard cuts removing earth albedo photons have been made .",
    "the dsphs are modeled as dm point sources using the dmfit package @xcite where we consider 100% annihilation into the _ bb _ , the @xmath15 , the @xmath16 , and the @xmath17 annihilation channel .",
    "the background is modeled according to fermi - lat recommendations @xcite , and sources within 15 degrees are modeled according to the first year point source catalog @xcite .",
    "we perform a binned analysis to use both energy and spatial information .",
    "the data selection and analysis are performed using the fermi - lat analysis package , sciencetools @xcite , and the upper limits are obtained using profile likelihood as implemented in the minuit processor minos @xcite .",
    "one large uncertainty in indirect dm detection methods arises from the uncertainties in the astrophysical factors , the j - factors .",
    "we have included these uncertainties by including the distribution of the j - factors in the likelihood fit , treating them as nuissance parameters .",
    "this is the first time j - factor uncertainties are included in this way . in our fits ,",
    "the parameter of interest is the wimp annihillation cross - section , @xmath18 , and the nuissance parameters are the j - factors , the normalizations of the diffuse backgrounds and the normalizations of sources within 5 degrees of the dsphs .    with this addition , the joint likelihood considered in our analysis becomes : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the binned poisson likelihood that is commonly used in a standard single roi analysis of the lat data , @xmath21 indexes the rois , @xmath22 represents the binned gamma - ray data , @xmath23 represents the set of roi - independent dm parameters ( @xmath18 and @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 are the roi - dependent model parameters . in this analysis , @xmath25 includes the normalizations of the nearby point and diffuse sources and the j - factor , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath29 , approximated to be gaussian .",
    "the values for the j - factors have been updated since the preliminary work was presented at the conference , and the updated values are found in table [ dwarfs ] .",
    "a detailed discussion about how the j - factors are obtained are found in @xcite .",
    "we have performed tests on the coverage of the joint likelihood method and also tests on how the combined limits scale with the number of added targets . in our fits , we constrain the @xmath18 parameter to be positive .",
    "our tests show that this will make the combined limit scale as better than @xmath30 , where n is the number of added targets .",
    "the hardness of the dm spectra will also influence , resulting in a larger improvement for harder spectra .",
    "the coverage of our method is good but with slight overcoverage for small signals , i.e. conservative limits .",
    "]      in fig . [ fig1 ]",
    "we present constraints on the wimp annihilation cross - section into 100% _ bb _ for ten dsphs , both individual and combined limits . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the combined limits on wimp annihilation cross section for annihilation into 100% _ bb _ , 100% @xmath15 , 100% @xmath16 , and 100% @xmath17 .",
    "j - factor uncertainties have been included .",
    "the joint likelihood method allows us to rule out wimp annihilation with cross sections predicted by the most generic cosmological calculation up to a mass of @xmath030 gev for the _ bb _ and the @xmath15 annihilation channel .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .",
