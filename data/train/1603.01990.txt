    "water is an endlessly fascinating substance with many anomalous properties , of which its expansion on freezing and its density maximum at @xmath0  @xmath1c are just two of the most famous .",
    "the fascination is only deepened by the apparent simplicity of the h@xmath2o molecule itself . because of its importance for life , for the earth s geology and climate , and for innumerable domestic and industrial processes , water in all its forms has been one of the most widely studied of all substances . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "it offers unrivaled opportunities to deepen our understanding of hydrogen bonding ( h - bonding ) .",
    "a little over @xmath3 years ago , the first attempts were reported to derive and interpret the properties of liquid water from electronic - structure calculations based on density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "this idea has proven immensely productive , and has been developed by many research groups , but the search for a fully satisfactory dft description of water systems has been unexpectedly arduous , and is not yet complete .",
    "our aim here is to review what has been learnt so far , and to assess the challenges that remain .",
    "an important feature of the review is that we aim to cover dft work not only on the liquid , but also on clusters and ice structures .",
    "the first ever dft simulations of liquid water , pioneered by parrinello , car and co - workers  @xcite , followed a long history of water modeling based on force fields ( see e.g. refs .",
    "it was recognized over @xmath4 years ago that the bent shape of the h@xmath2o molecule and the electronegativity of oxygen make electrostatic forces very important  @xcite .",
    "the earliest force fields represented the coulomb interactions in terms of point charges , with overlap repulsion and dispersion modeled by simple potentials , the molecules being assumed rigid and unpolarizable .",
    "such elementary models can be remarkably successful for the ambient liquid  @xcite , but their transferability is poor .",
    "the dipole moment of the h@xmath2o molecule is known to increase by @xmath5  % from the gas phase to the ice and liquid phases  @xcite , so that the neglect of polarizability is a serious limitation .",
    "a large research effort has been devoted to the development of accurate models that treat the molecules as polarizable and flexible  @xcite and include the weak intermolecular covalency that has often been thought significant  @xcite .",
    "the most sophisticated of these models have the declared aim of describing all water systems , from clusters through ice structures to the liquid ( see e.g. refs .",
    "reviews of the many force fields that have been proposed can be found elsewhere , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .    by definition ,",
    "close approximations to the true exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional of dft would automatically deliver everything offered by force - fields and more .",
    "the search for such approximations for pure water systems is important for several reasons .",
    "dft gives direct access to electronic charge distributions , which are important for the interpretation of experimental observables such as infra - red spectra  @xcite , dielectric properties  @xcite , x - ray scattering intensities  @xcite , surface potentials  @xcite , etc .",
    "it also provides a way of investigating water systems completely independent of force - fields , so that it gives the possibility of fruitful dialog between the approaches .",
    "although our review is restricted to pure water systems , the development of improved xc approximations reviewed here is highly relevant to the dft description of more general aqueous systems , including solutions and acid - base systems  @xcite , as well as confined water  @xcite and water adsorbed on surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the crucial role of h - bonding in the cohesion of water systems  @xcite makes them an outstanding paradigm of this bonding mechanism , which is so widespread in many other molecular systems , including those important in biology  @xcite .",
    "this means that the challenges to dft to be described here for pure water systems will have a wide relevance .",
    "the xc functionals known as generalized gradient approximations ( ggas ) are among the most popular and successful for a great variety of condensed - matter systems , and they were used for the first dft simulations of liquid water .",
    "appropriately chosen ggas were found to give quite satisfactory binding energies for the water dimer  @xcite and the common form of ice  @xcite , and when used in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations gave a reasonable structure for the liquid  @xcite .",
    "the early successes prompted a surge of interest in the use of gga - based simulations to explore a wide range of important questions concerning water itself , such as h - bond dynamics , electronic properties , and the structure and diffusion of hydronium and hydroxyl ions .",
    "simulations of this kind have also been very widely used to probe the solvation shells around a variety of ions and other neutral solutes in water .",
    "a review of dft - based md work both on pure water and on a wide range of aqueous systems can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . the widespread use of dft for simulating interfaces involving aqueous systems and water adsorbed on surfaces is also noteworthy ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the new insights gained in these investigations would in many cases have been difficult or impossible to achieve with force - field methods , and the enormous value of dft - based simulations of aqueous systems is beyond dispute .",
    "nevertheless , it became clear over @xmath6 years ago that the description of liquid water given by ggas was not completely satisfactory  @xcite .",
    "fortuitous cancelation of errors in the earlier work had made the approximations seem more accurate than they really were  @xcite .",
    "it was also discovered that gga predictions of energy differences between extended and compact structures of some water systems , including larger clusters and ice , are qualitatively wrong  @xcite .",
    "these discoveries stimulated a re - examination of xc approximations for pure water systems that continues to this day , and we shall try to decribe what has been learnt from this .",
    "an important outcome will be that dispersion is crucially important , and that some of the errors of ggas come from their failure to describe dispersion correctly .",
    "it has been recognized for many years that h - bonding is the dominant mechanism of cohesion in water systems  @xcite .",
    "however , h - bonding is a complex phenomenon , which can be analyzed into electrostatic attraction , polarization , dispersion and partial covalency  @xcite , though the relative contributions of these components in water remain controversial , depending significantly on definition  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of partial covalency ( often termed charge transfer ) , for example , has been particularly contentious  @xcite . in addition",
    ", good xc functionals must correctly describe exchange - repulsion and monomer deformation .",
    "our point of view here will be that all these energy components can be in error , and our review of the research will try to assess where the main errors lie .",
    "the evidence will indicate that dispersion is far from being the only culprit .",
    "we will start by reviewing dft work on the water monomer and water clusters . the dft description of the monomer ( sec .",
    "[ sec : monomer ] ) is important for the electrostatic , polarization and monomer deformation parts of the energy , while the dimer ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] ) provides tests of h - bonding , where exchange - repulsion , dispersion and weak covalency also play a role .",
    "energies of the dimer in non - h - bonding geometries may help in separating the covalency contribution .",
    "dft work on clusters from the trimer to the pentamer ( sec .",
    "[ sec : coop ] ) gives further information about polarizability , while the isomers of the hexamer ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hexamer ] ) and larger clusters ( sec .",
    "[ sec : larger_clusters ] ) help to separate dispersion and exchange repulsion .",
    "we shall see that the energetics of ice structures ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ice ] ) is vital in assessing the roles of these energy components .",
    "the lessons learnt up to this point form the background to our review of dft work on the liquid ( sec .",
    "[ sec : liquid ] ) . in the final sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we draw together the evidence from all the water systems to assess the ability of current xc functionals to account for all the components of the energy .",
    "we summarize by proposing a simple scoring scheme , which assigns a numerical score to any given xc functional , based on the quality of its predictions for clusters and ice structures .",
    "the scheme may help to gauge the likely performance of the functional on the liquid .",
    "we should note at the outset that water is a vast subject , so that our review will inevitably be incomplete , as well as reflecting our own personal perspective .",
    "we provide in the appendix a brief survey of the main xc approximations that will be relevant .",
    "since electrostatic interactions are very important in all water systems , we need to know that available xc functionals reproduce the charge distribution of the free h@xmath2o monomer , or at least its leading multipole moments .",
    "this will ensure the correctness of the so - called first - order electrostatic energy , i.e. the coulomb interaction energy of an assembly of molecules when the monomer charge distributions are taken to be those of free monomers .",
    "in reality , the electric fields of the monomers distort each other s charge distributions , so it is important that xc functionals reproduce the polarizabilities of the free monomers , and ideally this should mean the response of the dipole and higher multipole moments to dipolar and higher multipolar fields .",
    "almost all published dft work on the charge distribution of the free h@xmath2o monomer reports only the dipole moment @xmath7 , though some information is available for the quadrupole moments .",
    "only a limited number of ggas appear to have been studied , but the blyp  @xcite and bp86  @xcite functionals reproduce the benchmark value of @xmath7 to within @xmath8  % , and the hybrid functionals b3lyp  @xcite and pbe0  @xcite are even better than this  @xcite .",
    "the rather sparse results for the quadrupole moments indicate that these are also correct to within a few percent  @xcite .",
    "so far as we are aware , dft calculations have been reported only for the components of the dipolar polarizability , and there is general agreement that ggas always overestimate them by @xmath9  %  @xcite .",
    "( the overestimation of molecular polarizabilities by ggas is a general phenomenon , which arises from the underestimation of the energies of virtual kohn - sham states relative to those of occupied states , which in turn is related to the incorrect behavior of the kohn - sham potential in the asymptotic region far from the molecule  @xcite . )",
    "hybrid functionals do much better , with the average polarizability from b3lyp and pbe0 being in error by @xmath10  % and less than @xmath11  % respectively  @xcite .",
    "the water monomer is flexible , and a correct description of its deformation energetics is likely to be important , for two reasons .",
    "one is that , in water clusters and condensed phases , formation of a h - bond weakens and lengthens the oh bond of the donor , and these effects help to determine the strength of the h - bond .",
    "the other reason is that the spectrum of intramolecular vibrations is an important experimental diagnostic of h - bond formation , which it is desirable to reproduce in simulations .",
    "the ability of gga and hybrid functionals to describe monomer deformation was investigated by santra _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who showed that the energy cost of stretching the o - h bonds of the monomer is significantly underestimated by pbe and blyp but is very accurately given by pbe0 .",
    "this is shown in panel  ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : monomer_deformation ] which plots the deformation energy @xmath12 in the symmetric mode as a function of the departure @xmath13 of the o - h bond length from its equilibrium value , @xmath12 being computed with the pbe , blyp and pbe0 approximations and with the benchmark ccsd(t ) technique ( coupled - cluster with single and double excitations and a perturbative treatment of triples  @xcite ) .",
    "( we note that the small offsets of the minima of the plots of @xmath12 _ vs _ @xmath13 are due to the fact that @xmath13 is computed in all cases relative to the equilibrium bond length given by pbe , which is slightly greater than the bond lengths given by pbe0 and ccsd(t ) . ) the deviations of the gga values of @xmath12 from the benchmark values ( inset of panel  ( a ) ) are _ ca . _  100  mev for a bond stretch @xmath13 of @xmath14   , but the errors of pbe0 are much smaller .",
    "the authors examined the consequences of this for the liquid by drawing a large sample of monomers from an md simulation of liquid water performed with flexible monomers .",
    "they found that bond stretches of up to _ ca .",
    "_  0.1    are very common , and they confirmed the accuracy of pbe0 and the substantial underestimates of the deformation energy given by pbe and blyp ( see panel  ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : monomer_deformation ] ) .",
    "this underestimate by ggas , also noted by other authors  @xcite , correlates with an erroneous softening of the intramolecular oh stretch frequencies , which are underestimated by @xmath8  % and @xmath15  % with pbe and blyp respectively , but are reproduced almost exactly by pbe0  @xcite .    the comparisons for",
    "the monomer thus help us to assess the accuracy of xc functionals for three important parts of the energy in general water systems , namely first - order electrostatics , polarization and monomer deformation .",
    "for all three , ggas appear to give reasonable , but far from perfect accuracy , while the accuracy of hybrid functionals is considerably better .",
    "the dimer is the simplest water system we can use to test the accuracy of xc functionals for the energy of interaction between h@xmath2o monomers in h - bonding and other geometries .",
    "the ( h@xmath2o)@xmath2 system has been thoroughly studied by very accurate ccsd(t ) calculations , which are believed to give the interaction energy in any geometry with errors relative to the exact value of no more than @xmath16  mev  @xcite . we know from such calculations that the geometry having the global minimum energy is the configuration labeled sp1 in fig .  [ fig : smith_sp ] .",
    "this is a typical h - bonding geometry , with the oh bond of the donor directed towards the o atom of the acceptor .",
    "we define the dimer binding energy @xmath17 as twice the energy of an isolated equilibrium monomer minus the energy of the dimer in its global - minimum geometry . according to ccsd(t ) , @xmath17 is @xmath18  mev , the equilibrium o - o distance @xmath19 being @xmath20    @xcite ; these values are consistent with the somewhat uncertain experimental values  @xcite .",
    "acceptable dft approximations must reproduce benchmarks for the binding energy @xmath17 and the geometry of the global minimum , and in fact most dft work on the water dimer has focused exclusively on this configuration . however , this is not enough , because both in the liquid and in compressed ice phases water monomers approach each other closely in non - h - bonded geometries , and the energetics of such geometries is very important .",
    "a simple way of going beyond the global minimum is to study the set of configurations on the energy surface of the dimer known as the smith stationary points ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smith_sp ] )  @xcite , some of which resemble geometries found in dense ice structures .",
    "we also review here assessments of xc functionals made using large statistical samples of dimer geometries designed to be relevant to condensed phases .",
    "we discuss first local and semi - local xc functionals , including the local density approximation ( lda  @xcite ) , ggas of different kinds , and hybrids , confining ourselves initially to the global minimum geometry .",
    "( see the appendix for information about the relevant xc approximations . )",
    "several extensive surveys have been published on the predictions of semi - local functionals for the water dimer  @xcite . in some work on the dimer ,",
    "full basis - set convergence was not achieved , so that the accuracy of the functionals themselves was not completely clear . however , ref .",
    "@xcite reported calculations very close to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit for 16 semi - local functionals applied to the dimer and other small water clusters .",
    "table  [ tab : dimer_gm ] reproduces some of the @xmath17 and @xmath19 values from that work , supplemented with results from ref .",
    "@xcite and from our own calculations performed in the present work .",
    "we performed our own calculations using the molpro  @xcite and vasp  @xcite codes , following the procedures described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the wide spread of predicted binding energies is striking .",
    "the lda is clearly unacceptable , since it overbinds the dimer by nearly a factor of 2  @xcite , and there are other functionals , such as pbesol  @xcite , which also overbind significantly . at the other extreme , functionals such as blyp and revpbe  @xcite underbind quite seriously . among the best functionals for @xmath17",
    "are pbe and its hybrid version pbe0",
    ". it will become clear below that functionals predicting a good @xmath17 can still give a poor description of larger clusters , ice structures and liquid water . the wide variability of @xmath17 with different semi - local functionals will turn out to be crucial for the understanding of extended water systems .    the reason why different semi - local functionals give such different binding energies in dimers of small molecules such as water is well known .",
    "it was recognized long ago  @xcite that the gross overbinding given by lda arises from a spurious exchange attraction . in ggas",
    ", this spurious attraction is suppressed by the exchange - enhancement factor @xmath21 , which depends on the reduced gradient @xmath22 of the electron density @xmath23 through the quantity @xmath24 .",
    "roughly speaking , the exchange - overlap interactions of blyp and revpbe are strongly repulsive and those of pbe and pw91 are weakly repulsive because of the very different behavior of their @xmath21 factors in the region of large @xmath25 where the tails of the monomer densities overlap  @xcite .",
    "this important difference between ggas will be referred to again several times .",
    "dispersion plays a vital role in the energetics of water systems , as we shall see later , but is not correctly described by the semi - local functionals discussed above .",
    "the past 20 years have seen the introduction of several different ways of accounting for dispersion ( see the appendix , and recent reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "one approach consists of the addition of potentials of various kinds to existing functionals , first explored nearly 20 years ago ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) and then extensively developed by grimme  @xcite , tkatchenko and scheffler ( ts )  @xcite and others .",
    "an alternative is the incorporation of explicitly non - local correlation functionals , pioneered by lundqvist , langreth and others  @xcite .",
    "the dcacp method of rothlisberger and co - workers  @xcite and the closely related dcp method of ref .",
    "@xcite are also noteworthy . in all these methods , a representation of non - local correlation energy is added to a chosen semi - local functional .",
    "the naming of these different approaches is not completely uniform in the literature , so we summarize briefly the nomenclature used throughout this review .",
    "the approach now generally known as the grimme method comes in three versions , which we denote by func - d1 , func - d2 and func - d3 , where `` func '' is the name of the semi - local or hybrid functional to which dispersion is added .",
    "similarly , we denote ts methods by func - ts , and methods based on the non - local functional of ref .",
    "@xcite by func - drsll ( the acronym drsll stands for the authors of ref .",
    "we denote by rpw86-df2 the method of ref .",
    "@xcite ( sometimes known as lmkll after the authors of this ref . ) , which employs a modified form of the drsll non - local correlation functional added to a revised version of the pw86 semi - local functional  @xcite .",
    "we summarize in table  [ tab : dimer_gm ] the dimer binding energies @xmath17 and equilibrium o - o distances predicted for the global minimum geometry by some of these schemes .",
    "this shows that the addition of dispersion to a semi - local functional always increases @xmath17 , as expected . for blyp and revpbe , which significantly underestimate @xmath17 , the dispersion - inclusive versions blyp - d3 and revpbe - drsll",
    "give improved values of @xmath17 , though the latter functional is still significantly underbound .",
    "by contrast , the addition of ts dispersion to pbe and pbe0 , which already gave accurate values of @xmath17 , inevitably worsens the predictions .",
    "the drsll - type functionals are particularly instructive in this regard .",
    "their original form  @xcite , based on revpbe , generally underbinds molecular dimers , so the underestimate of @xmath17 for the h@xmath2o dimer by revpbe - drsll comes as no surprise .",
    "it was pointed out  @xcite that better binding energies are obtained if less repulsive semi - local functionals are used in place of revpbe .",
    "it turns out that pbe is too weakly repulsive , so that pbe - drsll generally overbinds molecular dimers , including ( h@xmath2o)@xmath2 .",
    "however , if the exchange functional is appropriately tuned , much better approximations can be obtained .",
    "this is illustrated in the table by the optpbe - drsll and optb88-drsll approximations , which are based on tuned forms of the pbe and b88 functionals .",
    "similar arguments underlie the rpw86-df2 non - local functional  @xcite .",
    "the comparisons shown in the table indicate that the addition of dispersion increases @xmath17 by up to @xmath26  mev .",
    "this is comparable with the variation of @xmath17 resulting from different choices of semi - local or hybrid functional .",
    "we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : liquid ] that addition of dispersion to a semi - local functional can bring large changes in the structure and equilibrium density of the liquid , so that errors as large as @xmath27  mev in @xmath17 are important .",
    "we noted earlier the importance of accuracy for configurations other than the global minimum , and many authors have drawn attention to the role of non - h - bonded pair configurations in condensed phases of water  @xcite .",
    "the smith stationary points ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smith_sp ] ) provide some relevant geometries , but the only systematic studies of dft errors in these configurations appear to be those of refs .",
    "anderson and tschumper  @xcite studied 10 different gga and hybrid methods .",
    "all approximations gave the correct energy ordering , but most of them overestimated the energies relative to that of the global minimum , particularly for configurations sp4 , sp5 and sp6 , which closely resemble configurations in ice viii .",
    "relative energies for some semi - local and hybrid functionals are summarized in table  [ tab : smith_energies ] , which shows that pbe and blyp both overestimate the relative energy of configuration  sp6 by over @xmath28  mev .",
    "hybrid approximations are appreciably better , but still overestimate the relative energies . calculations of the energies relative to the global minimum with dispersion - inclusive methods do not appear to have been published , so we have made our own ( see table  [ tab : smith_energies ] ) .",
    "we find that optpbe - drsll and rpw86-df2 are both quite satisfactory , their errors in the relative energies all being less than @xmath29  mev .",
    "however , both pbe - ts and pbe0-ts are less satisfactory , giving relative energies of configurations 4 , 5 and 6 in error by @xmath30  mev .",
    "a characterization of xc errors for the global minimum and some special geometries is illuminating and useful , but a full characterization should cover all relevant o - o distances and monomer orientations .",
    "one way of doing this is to analyze the errors for large samples of dimers drawn from a md simulation of the liquid , as has been done by santra _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and gillan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . for this purpose , we must separate 1-body and 2-body errors in the sense of the many - body expansion ( mbe )  @xcite , which will also be important later . in general , the total energy @xmath31 of a system of @xmath32 monomers can be exactly expressed as : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the 1-body energy of monomer @xmath35 in free space , with the argument @xmath35 being short - hand for the set of coordinates specifying its geometry .",
    "similarly , @xmath36 is the 2-body energy of dimer @xmath37 , i.e. its total energy minus the 1-body energies of monomers @xmath35 and @xmath38 , with the arguments @xmath35 and @xmath38 being short - hand for the geometries of the monomers ( the prime on the summation indicates the omission of terms @xmath39 ) .",
    "the 3-body and higher terms needed for systems larger than the dimer are defined analogously .",
    "the zero of energy is conveniently taken as @xmath32 times the energy of an isolated equilibrium monomer . to analyze the errors of a chosen xc functional ,",
    "the total energy of each dimer in the sample and the 1-body energies of its monomers are computed , and the 2-body energy is obtained by subtracting from the total dimer energy the sum of the two monomer energies .",
    "the 1- and 2-body errors are then obtained by subtracting benchmark values of the 1- and 2-body energies , typically computed with ccsd(t ) .",
    "santra _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the errors of the blyp , pbe and pbe0 functionals for dimers drawn from the liquid .",
    "blyp values of the 2-body energies were underbound by an average of @xmath40  mev , while pbe and pbe0 values were overbound by @xmath9  mev .",
    "interestingly , the errors of all three functionals showed a scatter of around @xmath41  mev about their averages at typical o - o nearest - neighbor distances of @xmath42  ",
    ". there may be a link here with the errors in the relative energies of the smith stationary points .",
    "an interesting finding from the same work  @xcite was that the known enhancement of h - bond energy by elongation of the donor oh bond is significantly exaggerated by both gga functionals . the work of ref .",
    "@xcite examined the 2-body errors computed with semi - local functionals for a thermal sample of dimers covering a range of o - o distances from @xmath43 to over @xmath44   .",
    "this revealed the expected systematic underbinding of blyp over this range , and the much smaller errors of pbe , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer_2body_errors ] .",
    "we also present in this figure calculations on the same thermal sample performed with the blyp - d3 , pbe - d3 , pbe - ts and pbe - drsll functionals .",
    "we see that the excessive repulsion of blyp is largely eliminated by blyp - d3 , which becomes slightly overbound between @xmath45 and @xmath46  ",
    ". however , the pbe - based functionals are all overbound , with the overbinding errors of pbe - drsll being particularly strong in this range .",
    "interestingly , the typical difference of 2-body energy between the blyp and pbe functionals is comparable with the shifts due to dispersion , so that addition of d3 dispersion to blyp brings its 2-body energy rather close to that of uncorrected pbe .",
    "the typical energy difference between the dispersion - corrected functionals blyp - d3 and pbe - drsll is on the same scale as the energy shifts due to dispersion , so that the robustness of the methods clearly needs discussion .",
    "it is notable that the substantive differences between the various pbe - based methods in the region @xmath47  exist despite the close agreement between their global - minimum binding energies ( table  [ tab : dimer_gm ] ) .",
    "it has been shown by bartk _",
    "_  @xcite that machine - learning techniques operating on very large thermal samples of dimers can be used to create very accurate , but rapidly computable representations of the 1- and 2-body errors of chosen xc functionals .",
    "these techniques , based on the gap ( gaussian approximation potential ) method of machine learning  @xcite , give a way of compensating almost exactly for the 1- and 2-body errors of any chosen xc functional .",

    "[ sec : larger_clusters ] and [ sec : ice ] ) work on large water clusters and ice based on xc functionals corrected in this way .    in summary",
    ", we have seen that both semi - local and dispersion - inclusive functionals vary quite widely in their predictions of the h - bond energy .",
    "the variability affects the 2-body energy in the important region of o - o separation extending from @xmath43 to at least @xmath46   .",
    "we have noted the importance of the exchange - enhancement factor as one cause of this variability .",
    "the variation between different functionals is comparable with the increase of binding energy resulting from the addition of dispersion .",
    "the energies of the smith stationary points relative to the global minimum are significantly overestimated by both semi - local and dispersion - inclusive functionals .",
    "it has long been known that hydrogen bonding in water and in many other molecular systems is a cooperative effect : if molecule a donates a h - bond to molecule b , the propensity of molecule b to donate a h - bond to molecule c is thereby enhanced  @xcite .",
    "the cooperativity manifests itself in the non - additivity of h - bond energies . in suitable geometries , an assembly of water molecules",
    "is stabilized by the mutual enhancement of h - bonds  @xcite , so that the overall binding energy is greater than the sum of dimer binding energies .",
    "this non - additivity of binding energies can be understood as resulting from molecular polarizability : the electron cloud on each monomer is distorted by the electric fields of its neighbors , and this changes its electrostatic interaction with other monomers .",
    "we noted in the introduction that this is a strong effect , since molecular polarizability enhances the dipole moment of water monomers in ice and liquid water by @xmath5  % above that of monomers in free space  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested by frank and wen  @xcite that the cooperativity would play an important role in the dynamical making and breaking of h - bonds in liquid water , and subsequent calculations and experiments have fully confirmed the importance of h - bond cooperativity in water systems of all kinds , including ice and clusters ( see e.g. ref .",
    "it is clearly important to know whether dft approximations reproduce these cooperative effects .",
    "fortunately , h - bond cooperativity is already important in small water clusters , where it has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",

    "the average binding energy of the four isomers is quite accurately given by pbe and pbe0 ( see above ) , which reproduce both its 2-body and beyond-2-body components .",

    ". ) however , the large error in the average binding energy given by blyp arises from its excessive 2-body repulsion together with a smaller but still significant beyond-2-body overbinding  @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that the errors can not be explained by incorrect dispersion alone .",
    "it has been proposed recently  @xcite that the many - body errors of ggas for water ( and other molecular systems ) are closely linked to the choice of exchange - enhancement factor @xmath62 , which we know has an important influence on the 2-body interaction energy ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] ) .",
    "it appears that an @xmath62 that gives excessive exchange - overlap repulsion in the dimer also tends to produce an overly attractive 3-body interaction , while an @xmath62 whose 2-body exchange - overlap repulsion is too weak produces a spurious 3-body repulsion .",
    "the suggestion is that the accurate dimer binding energy given by pbe results from an overly weak exchange - repulsion mimicking the missing dispersion , the indirect consequence being the erroneous stability ordering in the hexamer due to the exaggerated 3-body repulsion .",
    "conversely , the excessive 2-body repulsion of blyp , to which dispersion should be added , is linked to the unduly attractive 3-body interaction noted above .",
    "the idea of an inverse correlation between the 2-body and beyond-2-body errors of semi - local functionals is confirmed by recent work on a wide range of molecular trimers  @xcite .    the extensive work on the hexamer teaches us several lessons .",
    "first , good accuracy for the dimer ( and other clusters smaller than the hexamer ) is no guarantee of even qualitative correctness for the relative stability of compact and extended conformations .",
    "second , many - body errors may be at least as important as 2-body errors , but the relative importance of the two kinds of error depends strongly on the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "third , dispersion is crucial , and demands to be correctly described .",
    "fourth , dispersion is not the only source of errors , and there is evidence that the many - body errors are associated with exchange .",
    "we shall see in the following how these lessons are reinforced by dft work on larger clusters , ice structures and the liquid .",
    "for many years , quantum - chemistry benchmark calculations were feasible only on rather small clusters , with the hexamer representing the practical limit for basis - set converged ccsd(t ) .",
    "however , technical innovations are now helping to extend the calculations to much larger clusters without significant loss of accuracy .",
    "in fact , well converged mp2 calculations were possible on clusters of 20 - 30 monomers several years ago , but with the development of linear - scaling methods , they can now be applied to even larger systems  @xcite .",
    "corrections for the difference between ccsd(t ) and mp2 can then be made using the many - body expansion for this difference  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is growing evidence that the accuracy of quantum monte carlo methods  @xcite rivals that of ccsd(t ) for non - covalent interactions  @xcite , and the mild scaling of these methods with system size and their high efficiency on parallel computers make it practical to compute benchmarks for water systems containing @xmath28 or more monomers  @xcite .",
    "the availability of very accurate benchmark energies for large clusters opens the interesting possibility of tracing out the development of dft errors as a function of cluster size .",
    "the notion here is that as we go to ever larger clusters the errors should come to resemble ever more closely those seen in ice structures and the liquid .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of the errors into their 2-body and beyond-2-body components , similar to that discussed above for the hexamer , allows us to deepen our understanding of the continuous connections between these errors in clusters and in condensed phases .",
    "these ideas have been explored  @xcite for thermal samples of water clusters containing up to @xmath63 monomers , the benchmark energies being computed with the dmc technique .",
    "the sets of configurations for each water cluster were drawn from md simulations performed with a realistic force field that treats the monomers as flexible and polarizable . for large enough clusters , these configurations should be roughly typical of those found in small water droplets .",
    "the time - varying radius of a cluster of @xmath32 monomers can be characterized by the quantity @xmath64 defined by : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the position of the o atom of monomer @xmath35 at time @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the centroid of these o positions .",
    "this `` radius of gyration '' @xmath64 fluctuates in time as the cluster spontaneously breathes in and out , exploring compact and extended configurations .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : hexamer ] that the errors of ggas for the hexamer grow more positive as we pass from extended to compact isomers , and one might expect a similar dependence on @xmath69 for thermal clusters .",
    "this expectation is amply fulfilled for the ggas examined so far , namely blyp and pbe .",
    "the analysis of the errors of these approximations has been reported  @xcite for thermal clusters containing @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath29 and @xmath63 monomers , with the gap techniques mentioned above ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] ) used to correct almost exactly for 1- and 2-body errors . if only 1-body errors are corrected (",
    "the resulting approximations are called blyp-1 and pbe-1 ) , it is found for all the clusters that blyp-1 has large positive errors , while pbe-1 has much smaller errors , the errors in both cases growing more positive with decreasing @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nanodrop27 ] ) .",
    "after correction for both 1- and 2-body errors ( approximations blyp-2 and pbe-2 ) , blyp-2 has negative errors showing a weak downward trend with decreasing @xmath69 , while pbe-2 has almost the same errors as pbe-1 , trending upwards with decreasing @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nanodrop27 ] ) .",
    "all these trends are very much the same as for the isomers of the hexamer , though the magnitude of the errors increases markedly with cluster size .",
    "exactly as for the hexamers , the erroneous destabilization of compact relative to extended configurations is mainly a 2-body effect with blyp , but mainly a beyond-2-body effect for pbe .",

    "widely used force fields sometimes yield completely erroneous predictions for these transitions  @xcite , so that there has been considerable interest in dft treatments  @xcite .",
    "the transformation of ice ih to a low - temperature ordered phase was conjectured over 60 years ago  @xcite , but the experimental evidence for a transition near @xmath72  k appeared only more recently  @xcite .",
    "simple electrostatic arguments  @xcite suggest that the low - temperature phase ice xi should be antiferroelectric , but this expectation is contradicted by diffraction and thermal depolarization experiments  @xcite , which indicate that it is actually ferroelectric , though the interpretation of the experiments has been challenged  @xcite .",
    "dft calculations based on the blyp functional  @xcite , in conjunction with graph - theoretic methods used to enumerate h - bonding topologies  @xcite , support the ferroelectric assignment .",
    "the parameterized models produced in the course of this computational approach , when used in statistical - mechanical calculations , yield a transition temperature of @xmath93  k  @xcite in respectable agreement with the experimental value .",
    "it was shown later  @xcite that this outcome is not significantly altered if other xc functionals are used in place of blyp . remarkably , even the unsophisticated lda functional yields essentially the same result  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued from this that the electrostatic part of the energy dominates the energetics of proton ordering , as originally proposed by bjerrum  @xcite , and that the inability of common force fields to describe the energetics correctly arises from their failure to reproduce the high multipole moments of the charge distribution of the h@xmath2o monomer  @xcite .",
    "another approach to the transformation between ice ih and xi was taken by ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "mc sampling based on the dispersion - inclusive functionals pbe - d2 and blyp - d2 , and also their hybrid counterparts pbe0-d2 and b3lyp - d2 was used to compute the static dielectric constant @xmath94 and the ice ih / xi transition temperature .",
    "it was found that pbe0-d2 at @xmath95  k gives @xmath94 roughly @xmath3  % greater than the experimental value of @xmath96 , while the value with pbe - d2 is roughly @xmath97  % greater , so that the over - polarizability of the h@xmath2o molecule with pbe ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : monomer ] ) is clearly significant .",
    "the transition temperature computed with pbe0-d2 in this work was in the range @xmath98  k , in satisfactory agreement with experiment .",
    "calculations combining dft with graph - theoretic methods have also been successful in treating the transformation of other proton - disordered phases to their low - temperature ordered counterparts , including ice vii to viii  @xcite , xii to xiv  @xcite and v to xiii  @xcite . where comparison with experiment is possible , the symmetries of the ordered phases are correctly predicted , and the transition temperatures are approximately correct .",
    "however , there appears to be one exception , namely the transition from ice vi to xv , where experiment shows the ordered phase to be antiferroelectric  @xcite , while dft calculations consistently make the most stable structure ferroelectric  @xcite .",
    "hybrid and dispersion - inclusive functionals give the same result , as do calculations based on mp2 and the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite , which are expected to be even more accurate . in discussion of the possible origins of this paradox , it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the so - called `` tin - foil '' boundary conditions implicitly used in conventional electronic - structure calculations on periodic systems may not be appropriate for the ice vi - xv transition .",
    "it was shown that if instead the boundary conditions are allowed to reflect the electrostatic environment in which ice xv grows , then the ferroelectric phase may be sufficiently disfavored for the antiferroelectric phase to become more stable . the experimental work of ref .",

    "@xcite tackled this question by performing dft calculations on the lowest - energy proton - ordered forms of the two crystal structures , using the xc functionals pbe , pbe0 , blyp - d3 and optpbe - drsll ; accurate reference calculations with dmc were also reported .",
    "the conclusion from their work was that the two structures are isoenergetic within the technical tolerances of the calculations , the indication being that the energy difference is less than @xmath11  mev / monomer .",
    "this conclusion is supported by later work from geiger _",
    "et al . _",
    "it has been shown very recently  @xcite that the clear preference for ice ih over ice ic observed in nature may be due to the difference of anharmonic vibrational energy between the two phases .",
    "we conclude this section by commenting briefly on the influence of isotope effects on the properties of ice . in almost solids ,",
    "the replacement of a heavier isotope by a lighter one causes an expansion of the equilibrium volume .",
    "the reason is that expansion normally reduces the vibrational frequencies and hence the zero - point energy , the reduction being greater for lighter isotopes .",
    "it therefore comes as a surprise that the equilibrium volume of the h@xmath2o form of ice ih is less than the d@xmath2o form  @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently  @xcite that this anomalous isotope effect occurs because expansion of ice weakens the h - bonds , which in turn strengthens the intramolecular o - h bonds , thus increasing their frequency .",
    "however , the consequences of this increase are partially canceled by the softening of other vibrational modes .",
    "some of the common force - fields for water wrongly predict a normal isotope effect , but dft calculations generally give the observed anomalous isotope effect , at least with the xc functionals examined so far .",
    "it has been noted recently  @xcite that the same mechanism leads to an interesting isotope effect on the temperature of the transition from ice ih to xi .",
    "our review of dft work on liquid water will be concerned with the structure of the liquid , its thermodynamic properties , and the dynamics of the molecules .",
    "we shall pay particular attention to the three radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) @xmath99 , the density @xmath100 of the liquid at near - ambient pressure , and the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath101 , all of which are available from experiment .",
    "some aspects of the dft simulation of the liquid have recently been reviewed by khaliullin and khne  @xcite .    as initial orientation , we refer to panel  ( a ) of fig .",

    "it is worth commenting here that there have been many experimental measurements of @xmath102 over the years ( see literature cited in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and there has been considerable controversy about the height of the first peak , but the measurements we compare with here are generally accepted to supersede earlier work .",
    "the first peak at o - o separation @xmath104    and the second peak at @xmath105    correspond rather closely to the first- and second - neighbor o - o distances in ice ih .",
    "the first - neighbor coordination number @xmath106 in the liquid is not uniquely defined , but is conventionally taken to be the integral @xmath107 under the first peak ( @xmath108 is the bulk number density ) up to the radius @xmath109 of the first minimum .",
    "the diffraction experiments all give a coordination number @xmath106 in the region of @xmath110 , which is consistent with roughly fourfold tetrahedral bonding .",
    "however , there is clearly considerable disorder , since the experimental @xmath102 is quite close to unity over the range @xmath111   , throughout which there are no neighbors in ice ih ; all diffraction measurements agree that the value of @xmath102 at its first minimum is @xmath112 .",
    "this means that there is substantial penetration of molecules from the second shell into the shell of h - bonded first neighbors .",
    "the phenomenon of cross - shell penetration is crucially important in liquid water , and is closely linked to the density increase on melting .",
    "the amount of penetration is sensitive to pressure , and diffraction experiments  @xcite show that a pressure of only @xmath113  gpa ( @xmath6  kbar ) is enough to increase the o - o coordination number from _ ca .",
    "_  @xmath0 to _ ca .",
    "_  @xmath57 , an effect that occurs by collapse of the second shell into the region of the first shell , without significant breaking of h - bonds  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the penetration in the liquid is closely related to changes of ice structure with increase of pressure , exemplified by the presence of non - h - bonded first neighbors at approximately the same distance as the h - bonded neighbors in ice viii .",
    "cross - shell penetration also appears to be intimately linked to diffusion , which requires molecules to cross the region @xmath111   ; since the lifetime of h - bonds under ambient conditions is estimated to be in the region of @xmath11  ps  @xcite , this crossing must be frequent .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : ice ] that ggas grossly exaggerate the energy difference betwen the extended ice ih structure and compact structures such as ice viii .",
    "they make it too difficult for a molecule to approach another molecule that is already h - bonded to four others , and the problem is cured by accounting for dispersion .",
    "we can anticipate that the same mechanisms will operate in the liquid , so that ggas will generally hinder penetration , making the liquid over - structured and under - diffusive , with a high pressure needed to maintain the experimental density .",
    "accordingly , a leading theme of our survey of dft work on the liquid will be the concerted efforts of the past few years to address the difficulties of liquid structure , thermodynamics and dynamics with dispersion - inclusive methods .",
    "we shall see that these efforts have enjoyed considerable success , but it will also become apparent that current dispersion - inclusive methods are still immature , and that over - correction can be as much of a peril as under - correction .",
    "we shall also see that purely technical issues have sometimes made it difficult to judge the true capabilities of any given dft method .",
    "it is not trivial to assess how well an xc functional performs for the liquid , because the first - principles simulation of the liquid raises many tricky technical issues that are completely absent from the study of clusters or static ice structures .",
    "thermodynamic , structural and dynamical quantities such as the pressure @xmath114 , the radial distribution functions @xmath99 and the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath101 are all calculated as time averages over the duration of the simulation , which must be long enough to yield useful statistical accuracy .",
    "furthermore , collection of the data to be averaged can only begin after the system has been ` equilibrated ' , i.e. simulated for long enough to ensure that memory of the initial conditions has been lost .",
    "the problems of equilibration and time averaging are exacerbated in water by the wide separation of timescales between intramolecular and intermolecular motions , which hinders energy transfer between these degrees of freedom .",
    "memory times can be reduced by the use of thermostats , but dynamical quantities may then be falsified . in md simulations of water based on force fields ,",
    "the equilibration and production phases commonly have durations of @xmath87  ps or more ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but such durations have been impractical in dft simulations until recently  @xcite .",

    "the method known as second - generation cpmd  @xcite combines the strengths of these two techniques .",
    "in addition , first - principles monte carlo simulation is also feasible  @xcite .",

    "significant discrepancies may also arise from the use of different statistical - mechanical ensembles , which are expected to yield identical results in the thermodynamic limit , but not in finite systems .",
    "inadequate basis sets too can be a source of inaccuracy .",
    "system - size errors present yet another hazard : ideally , the size of the periodically repeated simulation cell should be systematically increased at constant density until the observables of interest settle to converged values , but in practice the cell size is constrained by the computer budget .    these and other technical difficulties plagued much of the pioneering dft work on water , but the problems started to be clearly identified and addressed around 10 years ago  @xcite and it is now understood in principle how to bring most of them under firm control .",
    "the conditions necessary for adequate equilibration , statistical averaging and thermostating were analyzed in ref .",
    "the equivalence of car - parrinello and born - oppenheimer dynamics and the range of fictitious mass needed to ensure this equivalence were established in refs .",
    "system - size errors have turned out to be only a minor concern for many thermodynamic and structural quantities , provided systems of 64 molecules or more are used  @xcite , although substantial ( but well understood ) size corrections are needed for the diffusivity  @xcite .",
    "increasing computer power has made it much less necessary to compromise on basis - set completeness .",
    "nevertheless , technical uncertainties continue to be troublesome even now , as will become clear below .",
    "in addition to the technical issues just outlined , there is also the physical phenomenon of quantum nuclear effects ( qne ) .",

    "we start by discussing the very popular approach in which correction potentials are added to the blyp functional  @xcite . as noted in the sections on clusters and ice structures and in the appendix , there are a number of methods of this type , including the different versions of blyp - d due to the grimme group  @xcite , and dcacp - corrected blyp as developed by rothlisberger and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to include here simulations based on blyp+gap  @xcite , which corrects almost exactly for the 1- and 2-body errors of blyp and therefore accounts for dispersion , which is expected to be mainly a 2-body interaction in water systems  @xcite .",
    "we already know that all these methods give a much better description of clusters and ice structures than blyp itself , so there is good reason to hope for improvements in the liquid as well .",

    "the large differences in the liquid properties given by different simulations based on uncorrected blyp ( see above ) carry over to dispersion - corrected blyp , as can be seen in table  [ tab : liq_disp_blyp_pbe ] . focusing on the areas of agreement first",

    "taken together , the calculations suggest that with dispersion - corrected blyp @xmath100 is slightly overestimated , perhaps by @xmath16  % .",
    "this is not unexpected , since we saw that blyp corrected for 1- and 2-body errors using gap overbinds both water clusters and ice structures , and tends to compress both .",
    "the liquid structure is softened in similar ways by the different forms of dispersion - corrected blyp , the value of @xmath129 being lowered by @xmath158 and the value of @xmath132 being raised by @xmath159 .",
    "perhaps most important is that most of the simulations give @xmath160 , which is close to the well established experimental value of @xmath123 and is very much better than the value of @xmath161 given by uncorrected blyp .",

    "as expected from the structural softening , all the simulations agree that correcting blyp for dispersion increases the diffusion coefficient @xmath101 by a factor of @xmath162 , thus bringing it into fair agreement with experiment ( correction for system - size errors is essential in making this comparison , as emphasized above ) .",
    "the general consensus is that blyp corrected for dispersion , whether in the form of blyp - d , blyp - dcacp or blyp+gap is a considerable improvement over blyp itself , as might be hoped from the reasonable performance of these approximations for clusters and ice structures .",
    "two caveats should be noted , however .",
    "first , the blyp - d2 simulation of ma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which gave a high @xmath100 of @xmath163  g/@xmath116 , predicted a significant under - structuring of the liquid .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite stress that their simulations are performed very close to the cbs limit , and they suggest that the basis sets used to generate grimme s d2 representation of dispersion may not have been large enough to guarantee compatibility with their own basis sets . this suggestion appears to deserve further investigation .",
    "second , dispersion - corrected blyp can not be regarded as fully satisfactory , since we know that it suffers from beyond-2-body over - binding , which is presumably the reason why its value of @xmath100 is too high by a few percent in most of the simulations .",
    "the pbe approximation has rivalled blyp in popularity as a starting point for adding dispersion , with a wide variety of techniques used to represent the dispersion .",
    "simulations of liquid water have been published using the representations of dispersion due to grimme  @xcite and tkatchenko - scheffler  @xcite , as well as the dcacp method  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several simulations have been reported in which the non - local correlation functional pioneered by lundqvist , langreth and co - workers is paired with pbe  @xcite .",
    "we also refer here to a simulation of the compressed liquid based on gap - corrected pbe  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the addition of dispersion to pbe generally increases @xmath100 , though this leads to an overestimate by @xmath164  % in the case of pbe - drsll ( see table  [ tab : liq_disp_blyp_pbe ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the almost exact gap correction for 1- and 2-body errors gives very little change of pressure in the compressed liquid at density @xmath152  g/@xmath116  @xcite , so that the error in the pressure given by pbe appears to be mainly a beyond-2-body effect .",
    "with pbe as the starting approximation , the effect of dispersion on the liquid structure depends strongly on the method used to represent dispersion .",
    "the simulations based on grimme pbe - d  @xcite all show that the addition of dispersion does not cure the marked over - structuring given by pbe itself . in these simulations , the values of @xmath129 and @xmath132 are @xmath165 - @xmath166 and @xmath167 - @xmath168 respectively , compared with the experimental values @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( see table  [ tab : liq_disp_blyp_pbe ] ) , as we illustrate for the case of pbe - d3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : goo_disp_incl_expt ] . the same lack of structural softening was found with pbe - dcacp  @xcite , but the pbe - ts approximation appears to produce a modest softening  @xcite , the dispersion - corrected values of @xmath129 and @xmath132 being @xmath130 and @xmath169 .",
    "however , with drsll the softening is much stronger  @xcite , the corrected values of @xmath129 and @xmath132 being typically @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : goo_disp_incl_expt ] ) .",
    "such large differences between the pbe - based methods seem less surprising if one recalls ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] ) the strong overbinding produced by pbe - drsll in the range of o - o distances @xmath47    compared with pbe - d3 and pbe - ts .",
    "we note also our earlier comments about the wisdom of adding 2-body dispersion to pbe , given that pbe already slightly overbinds ice ih and is known to suffer from significant beyond-2-body errors .",
    "we return to this question later .    we know from our discussion of ice energetics that the success of the lundqvist - langreth approach depends very much on the underlying exchange functional with which dispersion",
    "is coupled .",
    "in addition to the pbe - drsll work just discussed , there have been several other simulations of the liquid in which drsll - type representations of dispersion are used in conjunction with different ggas .",

    "we try to draw together the main lessons that can be learnt from dft work on all the water systems discussed in this review . in the light of those lessons , we will then offer a more detailed interpretation of dft approximations for the liquid in sec .",
    "[ sec : liq_interpret ] .",
    "the extensive dft work on water systems reviewed here contains a wealth of information about the strengths and weaknesses of a wide variety of xc approximations .",
    "encouragingly , there are now dispersion - inclusive methods among them that describe fairly accurately the properties of water clusters , ice structures and the liquid",
    ". one of our aims here has been to aid further progress by elucidating the main reasons why some approximations are more successful than others .",
    "we have approached our task by attempting to analyze the performance of xc functionals in describing the main components of the energy , namely first - order electrostatics , polarization ( induction ) , dispersion , and weak covalency ( charge transfer ) , all acting in concert with exchange - overlap interactions .",
    "in addition , we have noted that the energetics of intra - molecular deformation can be important .",
    "we try to summarize here what we have learnt .",
    "since first - order electrostatics depends only on the charge distributions of unperturbed molecules , it is accurately reproduced by a functional that describes the monomer correctly .",
    "likewise , the polarizability part of the energy is correct if the functional describes the response of the monomer to appropriate electric fields .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : monomer ] that ggas generally describe the dipole and quadrupole moments of the monomer quite well .",
    "however , they somewhat overestimate polarizabilities , the predicted dipolar polarizability being typically @xmath6  % too large .",
    "hybrid functionals such as pbe0 and b3lyp give much more accurate polarizabilities . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : coop ] , the gga errors of polarizability would be expected to exaggerate the cooperative enhancement of h - bond energies , which should be better described by hybrids , and this is indeed the case for small clusters . in line with this , we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : ice ] that the pbe binding energy of ice ih is stronger than the pbe0 binding by nearly @xmath81  mev / monomer , which is a significant difference .",
    "we comment below on the effect of gga polarizability errors in the liquid .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : monomer ] that the intramolecular vibrational frequencies provide an important measure of the deformability of the monomer from its gas - phase geometry .",
    "the o - h stretch frequencies are appreciably underestimated by ggas , so that the monomer is too easily deformable , but hybrid functionals are more accurate .",
    "the effect of deformability errors on the liquid will be noted later .",
    "we now turn to dispersion , which has been the focus of much of the more recent work reviewed here .",
    "we have shown that semi - local functionals are generally incapable of accounting for the energy balance between extended and compact structures of water systems .",
    "they incorrectly favor the ring and book isomers of the hexamer over the prism and cage ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hexamer ] ) , and they grossly exaggerate the energy differences between compressed ice structures such ice viii and the ambient ih structure ( sec .  [ sec : ice ] ) .",
    "we have reviewed work based on a variety of dispersion - inclusive approaches , including those based on true non - local functionals  @xcite , those that add heuristic dispersion potentials to chosen semi - local functionals  @xcite , and those employing parameterized electron - ion potentials to mimic dispersion effects  @xcite .",
    "our survey has shown that all these approaches achieve greatly improved energy differences between extended and compact structures in clusters and ice structures",
    ". the crucial role of dispersion is thus beyond doubt .",
    "however , not all the dispersion - inclusive methods are equally good , because some of them achieve their improvements at the expense of worse h - bond energies in the dimer , the ring - hexamer and ice ih .",
    "these problems are connected with the description of exchange - overlap interactions .",
    "we have also seen ( sec .  [",
    "sec : dimer ] ) that there can be substantial differences in the distance dependence of the 2-body energy predicted by different dispersion - inclusive methods , even when these are based on exactly the same semi - local functional .",
    "we have shown that h - bond energies predicted by ggas and hybrids in the dimer , the ring hexamer and ice ih vary over a wide range , their strength being underestimated by @xmath61  % by revpbe and overestimated by @xmath30  % by pbesol .",
    "( lda overestimates by @xmath173  % . )",
    "we noted that this wide variation is mainly due to the very different behavior of the exchange - enhancement factor at large reduced density gradient , and we recalled that this mechanism was first recognized many years ago as a general effect for dimers of closed - shell atoms and molecules .",
    "some approximations such as pbe give an attractive interaction between closed - shell systems that mimics dispersion , but is in fact a mis - description of the exchange - overlap interaction .",
    "more strongly repulsive ggas such as blyp give no such attraction .",
    "this means that in order to reproduce the h - bond energy while also obtaining the correct extended - compact balance , dispersion should be added to a semi - local functional whose overlap interaction is given by an appropriately designed exchange - enhancement factor .",
    "this idea underlies the design of improved versions of the dispersion - inclusive functionals  @xcite based on the approach of dion _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and the general importance of the choice of semi - local functional in constructing dispersion - inclusive approximations has been stressed by a number of authors  @xcite .",
    "an interesting example of this is that the good accuracy of the pbe approximation for the h - bond energies of the dimer , the ring hexamer and ice ih is due to its spurious exchange attraction mimicking the missing dispersion .",
    "if dispersion could be mimicked by spurious exchange attraction without other errors , the failure of pbe to describe the extended - compact energy balance would be paradoxical .",
    "however , we saw in our discussion of the hexamer , the larger thermal clusters and the ice structures that the paradox is resolved by many - body errors .",
    "exchange - enhancement factors that create a spurious 2-body exchange attraction also give a spurious beyond-2-body repulsion , and this explains why pbe incorrectly destabilizes the prism and cage isomers of the hexamer ; the same mechanism contributes to its destabilization of compressed ice structures .",
    "the same beyond-2-body errors are seen in the large thermal clusters ( sec .",
    "[ sec : larger_clusters ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the blyp approximation exaggerates 2-body exchange repulsion and beyond-2-body exchange attraction , so that correction for its 2-body errors gives a moderate degree of overbinding , as we saw for the ice structures .",
    "the implication is that to obtain both correct binding energies of extended structures and correct relative energies of compact and extended structures , it is essential to use functionals that give both correct dispersion and correct exchange - overlap interactions .",
    "this is the message that emerges from the work on clusters and ice structures .",
    "the final energy component needing comment is weak covalency , sometimes referred to as `` charge transfer '' or `` delocalization '' energy .",
    "we noted in the introduction that the contribution of this mechanism to h - bonding in water systems has been much debated .",
    "it has been claimed  @xcite that compton scattering can be used to characterize the strength of partial covalency in ice ih , but subsequent analysis  @xcite suggests that this is not the case .",
    "however , later experimental work based on photoelectron and x - ray absorption spectroscopy  @xcite has been interpreted to indicate that electron transfer between monomers plays a significant part in determining charge redistribution in ice , and by implication in liquid water .",
    "it seems clear that quantitative statements about partial covalency depend significantly on the definition adopted .",
    "however , whatever definition is used , it appears to us that the self - interaction error committed by most practical xc approximations is likely to exaggerate the degree of partial covalency , as has been noted in the general context of h - bonding in ref .",
    "this may be the reason why ggas , and to a lesser extend hybrids , systematically overestimate the energy difference between non - h - bonded geometries of the water dimer and its global minimum .",
    "we noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : ice ] that this error may contribute to the destabilization of compressed ice structures . this possibility merits further study .    to summarize our analysis of dft errors in the various energy components :",
    "the most important deficiencies of conventional ggas and hybrids lie in their poor description of dispersion and exchange - overlap interactions ; dispersion - inclusive methods must describe both correctly if binding energies and the extended - compact energy balance are to come out right .",
    "accurate polarizabilities and monomer deformation energies are also not unimportant , so the incorporation of an appropriate fraction of exact exchange is desirable .",
    "errors in describing partial covalency may not be entirely negligible .      the strengths and weaknesses of xc approximations for clusters and ice structures that we have just outlined help to explain the characteristic features of dft simulations of the liquid .",
    "we noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : liquid ] that a key structural feature of the ambient liquid is the degree of cross - shell penetration ( csp ) , i.e. the probability of finding molecules at o - o separations in the range between @xmath45 and @xmath46    that is unoccupied in ice  ih .",
    "we can characterize csp crudely by the value of @xmath132 , the value of @xmath102 at its first minimum .",
    "we saw that @xmath132 depends strongly on xc approximation , ranging from @xmath174 for uncorrected pbe to @xmath175 for dispersion - inclusive revpbe - drsll , compared with the experimental value of @xmath123 at ambient conditions .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath101 correlates with @xmath132 , being too small by a factor of @xmath9 when @xmath121 and being in reasonable agreement with experiment when @xmath176 .",
    "two important energies would be expected to govern the degree of csp .",
    "the first is the h - bond energy , characterized roughly by the sublimation energy @xmath177 of ice ih , which is closely correlated with the binding energy @xmath17 of the dimer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h - bond_energy ] ) .",
    "if the h - bond energy is too strong , it will be too difficult to break h - bonds in the liquid , which will become too ordered , with too little csp .",
    "but we must also consider the energy change associated with the close approach of molecules that are not h - bonded to each other , which can be crudely characterized by the difference of sublimation energy @xmath178 between ice viii and ice ih .",
    "even if an xc approximation gives @xmath177 correctly , the liquid can still be over - structured because @xmath178 is too large , as is the case with uncorrected pbe .",
    "in addition to these two key energies , the distance dependence of the 2-body energy is also important .    by varying the semi - local functional and the dispersion that is added to it , we control both @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : liquid ] that as we pass through the series of ggas in order of increasing @xmath177 , the values of @xmath132 and @xmath101 systematically decrease , while the equilibrium density @xmath100 increases .",
    "however , good values of all three quantities can not be obtained simultaneously with any gga , and in addition @xmath178 is always seriously in error . if we add suitable dispersion to an appropriately chosen gga , we can ensure that both @xmath177 and @xmath178 are correct , as we know from the work on ice structures ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ice ] ) .",

    "[ sec : liquid ] that there are functionals that are not far from satisfying these conditions , while also giving a good description of the liquid : optb88-drsll is one example .",
    "this encourages optimism that satisfactory practical xc functionals for water systems are achievable .",
    "we consider that correct values for @xmath177 and @xmath178 are necessary for an xc functional to be satisfactory , but they may still not be sufficient to guarantee good liquid properties .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] that the pbe - d3 , pbe - ts and pbe - drsll functionals give almost the same dimer binding energy , but the distance dependences of their 2-body energies differ greatly , and this appears to explain their very different liquid structures .",
    "this may be an example of a general problem concerning the distance dependence of dispersion , which deserves closer scrutiny .",
    "for the water systems we have reviewed , correctness of the 2-body energy over the range of o - o distances out to @xmath179    appears to be essential .",
    "compared with the large effects of dispersion and exchange - overlap errors , the errors of polarizability and monomer deformability on the properties of the liquid appear to be less important .",
    "nevertheless , we have noted that the overestimated polarizability found with ggas will tend to enhance the h - bond strength , and we reviewed the evidence for a small resulting suppression of csp .",
    "a similar overstructuring may well be caused by the overestimated monomer deformability given by ggas , though as far we know this possible effect has never been quantified .",
    "the errors of both polarizability and deformability are much smaller with hybrid functionals , which should ideally be used as the basis for dispersion - inclusive simulations , if the computer budget permits .      in order to characterize the errors of xc functionals for water systems ,",
    "we have devised a scoring scheme , which assigns a percentage score to any chosen approximation , according to its performance for the properties of the water monomer , the dimer , the hexamer , and ice structures .",
    "the physical quantities employed in the present form of our scoring scheme are as follows .",
    "we score the binding energy of the dimer @xmath17 , the binding energy per monomer of the ring - hexamer @xmath180 and the sublimation energy @xmath177 of ice ih , because these characterize the h - bond energy .",
    "the difference per monomer @xmath181 between the binding energies of the prism and ring isomers of the hexamer , and the difference @xmath182 of the sublimation energies of ice ih and ice viii are also crucial , as we have seen .",
    "in addition , we regard the equilibrium o - o distance @xmath183 of the dimer , and the equilibrium volumes per monomer @xmath184 and @xmath185 of ice phases ih and viii as important . since the o - h bond - stretch energetics of the h@xmath2o monomer may be important , we characterize this by the symmetric stretch frequency @xmath186 of the monomer .",
    "we have seen that errors in the distance dependence of the 2-body energy of the dimer can also be troublesome , and these should clearly be scored , but we prefer not to attempt this until we have been able to report on a more detailed examination of dimer energetics with dispersion - inclusive functionals  @xcite .    for each of the scored quantities , the chosen xc functional gives some value @xmath187 , which generally deviates from the benchmark value @xmath188 .",
    "we assign a score of @xmath87  % if the magnitude of the deviation is less than a chosen tolerance @xmath189 .",
    "otherwise , we deduct @xmath6  % for each successive increment @xmath189 in @xmath190 . if @xmath191 , a zero score is given . for the binding energies @xmath17 , @xmath180 and @xmath177 , and for the compact - extensive differences @xmath192 and",
    "@xmath193 we adopt a tolerance of @xmath6  mev , except that in the case of @xmath194 prediction of the wrong sign gets a score of zero . for the equilibrium o - o distance of the dimer ,",
    "the tolerance is @xmath195    and for the equilibrium volumes of the ice ih and viii phases our tolerance is a @xmath11  % error .",
    "we allow a tolerance of @xmath3  @xmath196 for the monomer frequency @xmath186 . finally , the overall percentage score for a given functional is simply the average of all the individual scores .",
    "we present in table  [ tab : scoring ] the individual and overall scores for the local and semi - local functionals lda , pbe , blyp and pbe0 and for a selection of dispersion - inclusive functionals .",
    "the xc functionals scored here are those for which data is readily available , but in the future it would be useful to score a wider range of functionals .",
    "we see from the table that the local , semi - local and hybrid functionals all score rather poorly because they completely fail to reproduce the energy differences @xmath192 and @xmath178 , and they also struggle with the volume per monomer of ice viii .",
    "some of the dispersion - inclusive functionals score much better , but others , such as revpbe - drsll , pbe - ts and blyp - d3 do poorly , because of problems with ice energetics and volumes .",
    "overall , the highest scoring functionals are optpbe - drsll , optb88-drsll , pbe0-ts and rpw86-df2 , although even they have notable deficiencies .",
    "it is striking that some functionals that score well for the binding energies of the dimer and the ring hexamer and for the relative energy of the ring and prism isomers of the hexamer can still do poorly for the energies and volumes of ice structures .",
    "this may be due to errors in the distance dependence of dispersion .",
    "any recommendation of the `` best '' functional must be tentative , since our scoring table shows that all the functionals assessed here have faults . the optb88-drsll functional appears to be the most satisfactory , since it has the highest score and also gives a good liquid structure , according to refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also table  [ tab : liq_disp_revpbe_etc ] ) .",
    "its strong overbinding of ice ih is a cause for concern , but this may be due to the excessive long - range attraction of the 2-body energy , which seems to be a feature of drsll non - local correlation . of the next highest scorers , rpw86-df2 appears to give an understructured liquid  @xcite , and optpbe - drsll may do the same  @xcite .",
    "next in the scoring comes the hybrid - based pbe0-ts , which gives a good liquid structure , but would be expensive for general use .",
    "it may be worth commenting that our scheme has something in common with the methods developed by vega _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for characterizing the ability of force fields to describe water systems , but differs from them in important ways . most significantly , our scheme works only with simple and readily computable energies and structures that characterize clusters and ice structures , focusing on those quantities highlighted in the present review .",
    "by contrast , the scheme of vega _ et al .",
    "_ employs quantities such as the temperature of the maximum density and the surface tension of the liquid , whose calculation by dft methods would be very demanding .",
    "our approach to scoring is based on the idea that an xc functional should be required to work well for clusters and ice structures before being seriously considered for the liquid .",
    "however , we stress that a high score in our scheme may not be either necessary or sufficient to ensure success in describing the liquid at ambient conditions , since even simple , unpolarizable force fields can succeed for the ambient liquid  @xcite in spite of their poor description of clusters , and our scheme may not yet capture all the key features of xc functionals . on the other hand , a low score alerts one to the failure of a functional to describe at least _ some _ parts of the energy adequately .",
    "we should also note that our scheme is not meant to be definitive , and it can be extended and modified to suit different purposes .",
    "kohn sham dft is now 50 years old , and is one of the great success stories of molecular simulations .",
    "it has been extremely productive in furthering our understanding of water .",
    "however , here we have deliberately dwelt on the difficulties faced by current functionals in describing water systems , because we think that an analysis of these difficulties is needed for future progress .",
    "the past 10 years have been immensely fruitful in highlighting the crucial role of dispersion",
    ". however , some representations of dispersion are clearly not under satisfactory control , since different dispersion - inclusive methods can produce very different results .",
    "we have also emphasized here the sensitivity of predictions to the choice of the semi - local part of the xc functional .",
    "the erratic differences beween the various representations of dispersion already manifest themselves in the energetics of the dimer , and we think that satisfactory functionals should be required to reproduce this energetics accurately .",
    "in fact , the parameterization of some types of dispersion - inclusive functional , including grimme dft - d and the ts functionals , is explicitly based on benchmark data for molecular dimers such as the s22 set  @xcite .",
    "but for water the distance dependence of the dispersion damping is vitally important , and this has sometimes not been considered .",
    "the recent development of `` extended '' benchmark datasets which include a range of inter - monomer distances and/or monomer orientations  @xcite is therefore very welcome .",
    "we plan to report elsewhere on a more detailed study of the energetics of the water dimer than has been possible here .",
    "good dimer energetics is , of course , not enough for water , because some functionals suffer from substantial many - body errors , which are unrelated to polarizability or many - body dispersion , and which depend strongly on the choice of semi - local functional . until fairly recently ,",
    "such many - body errors for molecular systems have attracted rather little attention .",
    "however , the situation is now changing , with publications appearing that explicitly investigate these errors  @xcite .",
    "the study of molecular trimers is already enough to quantify some beyond-2-body errors , and in the case of water the energetics of the hexamer is very informative .",
    "we believe that the question of how to achieve small errors in both the 2-body and beyond-2-body energies of molecular systems in general and water in particular will repay deeper study .",
    "this review has focused on the strengths and weaknesses of xc functionals for a fairly limited set of properties : mostly energies , structures and to some extent dynamics .",
    "getting these basic issues right is a prerequisite to more detailed study of e.g. the electronic properties of water in the condensed phases , dissociation and proton transfer , the anomalies mentioned in the introduction , and , of course , a mapping of the entire phase diagram of water with dft . although some important work has been done with dft in some of these areas recently ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , much more work is needed with a broad range of functionals before we can provide a full answer to the question `` how good is dft for water ? '' .",
    "the computational cost of dft is the main factor that slows progress when it comes to establishing all the thermodynamic properties needed to map out the phase diagram of water . with this in mind , the development of dft - based machine learning potentials such as the gap approach discussed here or the neural networks from behler and co - workers  @xcite allow a wider range of water properties to be explored more rapidly with dft - level accuracy .    as a final comment ,",
    "it is worth noting that benchmark electronic - structure calculations based on mp2 , ccsd(t ) and quantum monte carlo are playing an increasingly important role in assessing dft methods for clusters and ice structures , but until now experiment has been the only source of accurate data for the liquid .",
    "the recent publication of simulations of liquid water based both on mp2  @xcite and on variational quantum monte carlo  @xcite suggests the exciting future possibility of obtaining benchmark liquid - state data for quantities that can not be measured experimentally .",

    "we are grateful to a number of people for reading and commenting on an earlier version of this manuscript , including m. tuckerman , b. santra , b. slater , j. vandevondele , g. sosso and a. zen .",
    "while this is primarily a review on dft for water , we include here a brief summary of the main features of some of the key xc functionals discussed in the review .",
    "our aim here is not to provide a comprehensive overview of xc functionals , but rather to provide some useful background information for those less well versed in the details of the functionals we refer to .",
    "we assume here a spin unpolarized system , whose distribution of electron number density is @xmath197 .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite was the original approximation used in all the earliest applications of dft .",
    "its exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy @xmath198 $ ] is the sum of the exchange energy @xmath199 and the correlation energy @xmath200 , which are expressed in terms of the exchange energy and the correlation energy per electron @xmath201 and @xmath202 in the uniform electron gas ( sometimes called `` jellium '' ) of density @xmath23 .",
    "the approximation takes the form : @xmath203 the exchange energy @xmath204 is given by the hartree - fock formula ( atomic units ) : @xmath205 .",
    "approximations for @xmath202 typically employ parameterized fits to quantum monte carlo data for the uniform electron gas , these fits being constrained to reproduce the leading terms of the high - density expansion . for dimers of closed - shell atoms and molecules ( e.g. rare gases )",
    ", the lda gives an attraction that resembles the dispersion interaction but is in fact an artefact due to the approximation made for exchange  @xcite .      in generalized gradient approximations ( ggas )  @xcite ,",
    "the xc energy depends locally on the gradient of the density @xmath206 as well as the density @xmath23 .",
    "the magnitude of the local gradient can be specified by the so - called `` reduced gradient '' , defined as the dimensionless quantity @xmath207 or sometimes as @xmath208 , so that ggas have the general form : @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 specify the local exchange and correlation parts .",
    "however , the exchange part can be simplified , using an exact condition that it must obey  @xcite under uniform scaling of the density , as a result of which the exchange part can be expressed as : @xmath212 =   \\int d { \\bf r } \\ , \\epsilon_{\\rm x}^0 ( \\rho ( { \\bf r } ) ) f_{\\rm x } ( s ( { \\bf r } ) ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath213 , the so - called exchange - enhancement factor , depends only on @xmath25 .",
    "many different ggas have been proposed , differing in their exchange - enhancement factors and the approximations for @xmath214 .",
    "we note that the form of @xmath215 at large reduced gradient is particularly important for non - covalent interactions in molecular systems such as water , because exchange - overlap interactions depend strongly on the behavior of @xmath215 in the regions where electron densities overlap , which is where @xmath25 has large values  @xcite .",
    "we note next the main features of the ggas relevant for this review .",
    "* blyp : * this functional has been extensively used for water systems , and consists of the b88 and lyp approximations for exchange and correlation respectively  @xcite .",
    "the b88 approximation of becke  @xcite has an exchange enhancement factor designed to reproduce exactly the exchange energy density in the limit of long distance from an isolated atom .",
    "it depends on a single parameter , which is adjusted to minimize the errors of the exchange energies of rare - gas atoms . for molecular systems ,",
    "this exchange functional has the desirable feature  @xcite that it eliminates the spurious exchange attraction between rare - gas atoms exhibited by the lda .",
    "the lyp correlation functional , so named for the paper by lee , yang and parr where it was introduced  @xcite , is derived from an older formula for correlation due to colle and salvetti  @xcite , who approximated it in terms of the electron density and the non - interacting kinetic - energy density .",
    "the lyp functional is a pure gga constructed by replacing the kinetic - energy density by its second - order gradient expansion .",
    "* bp86 : * this consists of exactly the same b88 functional  @xcite for exchange as the blyp functional , but replaces lyp correlation by the correlation functional known as p86 . the latter functional was constructed by perdew  @xcite so as to reproduce accurately the correlation energy of both the uniform electron gas and the electron gas with small gradients of the reduced density , and it also known to give accurate correlation energies for free atoms and ions .",
    "* pbe : * this widely used approximation  @xcite adopts a simple functional form for the exchange enhancement factor @xmath215 proposed earlier by becke  @xcite to ensure satisfactory behavior in the long - distance tails of free atoms .",
    "however , the parameters appearing in this functional form are not regarded as empirically adjustable , as was done by becke , but are determined by requiring that exact conditions be satisfied .",
    "the form of the correlation energy density @xmath216 is also chosen so as to satisfy exact conditions on its behavior for small and large reduced gradients , and the parameters appearing in this form are likewise determined by the requirement that they satisfy exact conditions .",
    "pbe is therefore one of the few xc functionals whose parameters are all ( or almost all ) fundamental constants , rather than being adjusted to fit empirical data .",
    "however , the form of the exchange enhancement factor at large reduced gradient produces a spurious exchange binding of closed - shell atoms and molecules  @xcite .",
    "* pw91 : * this approximation  @xcite is a forerunner of the better known pbe functional .",
    "it differs from pbe in employing more complicated functional forms for the exchange and correlation energies .",
    "these functional forms and the parameters that enter them attempt to satisfy a wider range of exact conditions .",
    "the energy predictions of pw91 are often close to those of pbe . however , the forms of their exchange enhancement factors at large reduced gradient are substantially different  @xcite , and pw91 produces a spurious exchange binding of closed - shell atoms and molecules that is larger than that of pbe .",
    "* revpbe : * this is a modification of the pbe functional .",
    "the modification was proposed by zhang and yang  @xcite , and consists solely of changing the value of one of the constants appearing in the exchange enhancement factor .",
    "this change achieves considerably improved values of atomic total energies and molecular atomization energies . for molecular systems such as water ,",
    "the change is important because it greatly increases the overlap - repulsion between pairs of molecules  @xcite .",
    "* rpbe : * this functional  @xcite resembles revpbe in being a modification of pbe formed by changing the exchange enhancement factor , while leaving the correlation functional unchanged .",
    "however , in the case of rpbe , the functional form of @xmath215 is modified .",
    "the resulting @xmath215 is almost identical to that of revpbe for small and moderate values of @xmath25 , but increases more slowly at large @xmath25 values  @xcite .",
    "physical properties predicted with rpbe and revpbe generally differ rather little .",
    "* pbesol : * this is a modification of the pbe functional designed to improve predictions for the energetics of densely packed solids and their surfaces  @xcite .",
    "it achieves this by keeping the functional forms used for the exchange and correlation energies of pbe , while modifying the two coefficients specifying the expansion of these energies to second order in the density gradient .",
    "* am05 : * this functional , proposed by armiento and mattsson  @xcite , may be classified as a gga , but the principles on which it is based differ from those used to develop conventional ggas .",
    "its aim is to improve predictions for surface properties , which are often poorly predicted by functionals such as pbe .",
    "it has the unique feature that it is constructed to reproduce exactly the exchange - correlation energies of _ two _ types of model system : uniform jellium and the jellium surface .",
    "a hybrid xc functional is one formed by addition of a fraction of exact hartree - fock exchange to a chosen linear combination of local or semi - local functionals . for this purpose ,",
    "the hartree - fock exchange energy is defined to be : @xmath217 where @xmath218 are the kohn - sham orbitals of dft , and the double sum goes over all pairs of occupied orbitals .",
    "some justification  @xcite for mixing in a fraction of @xmath219 is supplied by the adiabatic connection theorem  @xcite , which underpins dft methods .",
    "we provide here brief notes about the hybrid methods that are relevant to this review .    * pbe0 : * this approximation is a hybrid version of the semi - local pbe functional , defined by  @xcite : @xmath220 so that the exchange part of the functional is a linear combination of @xmath221 and the usual pbe for exchange , @xmath222 , while the correlation part of the functional has the normal pbe form .",
    "* b3lyp : * this widely used hybrid is somewhat more complicated than pbe0 , since the semi - local parts of the xc functional themselves involve a linear combination of ggas and lda .",
    "it is defined as  @xcite : @xmath223 here , @xmath224 and @xmath225 are the exchange and correlation parts of the blyp functional ( see above ) , and the numerical values of the mixing coefficients are : @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 .",
    "dispersion refers to the attraction between atoms or molecules due to the coulomb interaction between correlated quantum fluctuations of their electron densities .",
    "these are also known as london forces and in the dft functional community often referred to as van der waals forces . at long distances ,",
    "where overlap of these densities is negligible , the dispersion energy falls off as the inverse 6@xmath229 power of the intermolecular distance @xmath230 . at distances",
    "where the overlap between the electron distributions vanishes , local , semi - local and hybrid functionals account only for interactions due to electrostatics and polarization , and are incapable of describing the @xmath231 behavior of dispersion .",
    "several approaches have been developed for overcoming this problem , as described in recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "one possible approach is simply to ignore the `` asymptotic '' region where dispersion falls off as @xmath231 , and to treat only the intermediate and short - range region where non - local correlation is expected to contribute most to bonding .",
    "this is the approach of the so - called minnesota functionals  @xcite , in which meta - ggas and their hybrids are carefully parameterized to reproduce both covalent and non - covalent binding energies , reaction - barrier energies , etc .",
    "an alternative approach , which also aims to treat only intermediate and short distances , involves the addition of artificial nucleus - electron potentials designed to mimic the energetics of non - local correlation , as in the dcacp and dcp methods .",
    "the minnesota functionals , as well as the dcacp  @xcite and dcp  @xcite methods , have enjoyed some success for molecular systems , and have been used to a limited extent for water systems .",
    "the simplest methods capable of accounting for dispersion in the asymptotic @xmath231 region involve the introduction of atom - atom pair potentials of the form @xmath232 between every pair of atoms a , b , which are added to chosen semi - local or hybrid functionals , referred to here as `` base '' functionals .",
    "this idea goes back nearly @xmath3 years  @xcite , and has been extensively developed by grimme and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath231 form must be damped at intermediate and short distances , and grimme proposed a damping scheme , as well as a procedure for assigning values to the coeffficients @xmath233 for several choices of base functional .",
    "this approach , known as dft - d or dft - d2  @xcite , has seen widespread use and achieves major improvements in the description of non - covalent interactions in molecular systems .",
    "one deficiency of dft - d2 is that it does not account for the dependence of atom - atom dispersion interactions on the chemical state and environment of the atoms .",
    "for example , the electron distribution on an atom may be compressed by its neighbors , so that its polarizability and hence its dispersion interaction with other atoms are reduced .",
    "the tkatchenko - scheffler ( ts ) scheme  @xcite is in the same general spirit as grimme s dft - d2 method , but it accounts for the dependence of dispersion interactions on changes of electron density , using the hirshfeld partitioning scheme  @xcite to assign a density distribution to each atom , which can vary as the atoms move .",
    "the dependence of dispersion on the chemical state of the atoms is also accounted for in a later development of the grimme scheme , known as dft - d3  @xcite . in principle , both the grimme and the ts schemes can be used in conjunction with any base functional .",
    "we have referred to the use of the dft - d3 and the ts methods for water systems throughout the present review , and in relation to ice we also referred to a modified version of the ts scheme that accounts for many - body dispersion @xcite .",
    "a rather different approach to the representation of dispersion is to include in the xc functional a non - local correlation term @xmath234 depending explicitly on electron densities at spatially separated positions  @xcite . when paired with a conventional gga representation of semi - local exchange - correlation , the total xc functional",
    "then becomes : @xmath235 the general form assumed for the non - local correlation term has usually been : @xmath236 where the kernel @xmath237 is itself a functional of the density , but ensures the correct asymptotic behavior of the dispersion interaction by falling off as @xmath238 at large separations @xmath239 .",
    "the earliest forms of this approach  @xcite were restricted to interactions between atoms or molecules whose densities do not overlap , but an important advance came with the proposal by dion _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite of a functional form valid for overlapping molecules in arbitrary geometries .",
    "the base functional proposed in that paper consisted of revpbe exchange and lda correlation , and we refer to the entire functional here as revpbe - drsll .",
    "it was shown later that the particular choice of base functional made by dion _",
    "substantially underbinds molecular dimers  @xcite , and that the performance can be greatly improved by choosing other base functionals .",
    "if pbe is paired with the drsll form of non - local correlation , giving the functional referred to here as pbe - drsll , molecular dimers are significantly overbound  @xcite . however",
    ", if the exchange parts of pbe of blyp are appropriately modified , giving base functionals known as optpbe and optb88  @xcite , then the resulting dispersion - inclusive functionals , here called optpbe - drsll and optb88-drsll , give much improved binding energies for dimers .",
    "similar arguments underlie the modified version of the drsll approach known as rpw86-df2  @xcite , in which a revised form of pw86 exchange is paired with a new form of the non - local correlation functional @xmath234 .    a simplified version of the non - local correlation kernel @xmath240 known as vv10 has been developed by vydrov and van voorhis  @xcite .",
    "this contains a free parameter @xmath241 , which allows the short - range damping of dispersion to be adapted to the base functional .",
    "technical developments due to sabatini _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite allow this approach to be implemented at a cost not much greater than that of standard ggas .",
    "the base functional originally recommended for vv10 consisted of revised pw86 exchange and pbe correlation , but other base functionals could also be used .",
    "although it is difficult to be precise , we comment on the relative approximate computational cost of the various functionals discussed . in brief",
    ", there is no significant difference between the cost of lda and the ggas .",
    "dispersion correction schemes such as the various generations of the dft - d approach or the ts method also do not incur any major computational overhead compared to the base gga they are added to .",
    "methods based on non - local correlation functionals can lead to a slow - down of no more than @xmath242  50% compared to a gga calculation , when implemented efficiently  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid functionals , when employed in periodic boundary conditions , as done for liquid water simulations , can be significantly ( roughly an order of magnitude ) more expensive than a gga .",
