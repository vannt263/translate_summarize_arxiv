    "in multilayer and quantum well structures , such as @xmath1 , the electrons bound to donor impurities situated in the barrier tend to migrate in the well , due to the favorable potential gap .",
    "there they are trapped by the impurity donors , such as @xmath2 , that are naturally or artificially present in the material .",
    "the trapping of one electron by a donor does not completely screen the charge of the donor itself , thus bounded states of negative charged donors are in principle and in practice possible.@xcite    a great deal of attention has been given to the formation and stability of negative donor centers in semiconductors in recent years .",
    "those systems , indeed , being the simplest many - body system , represent an interesting occasion to study the electron - electron interactions in solids .    in previous experimental and theoretical studies",
    "the dependence of the binding energy of the @xmath0 on the magnetic field strength and on the dimension of the quantum well have been done . while a great part of these works consider the on - center @xmath0",
    "problem,@xcite i.e. when the impurity donor is at the center of the well , the study of the off - center , i.e. when the impurity donor is displaced from the center of the well , and the barrier @xmath0 problem , i.e. when the donor is in the barrier , are much less investigated . on the theoretical side",
    ", zhu and xu@xcite studied the spin - singlet l=0 and the spin - triplet l=-1 states for a quasi-2d @xmath0 while fox and larsen@xcite studied the barrier @xmath0 in which the electrons are moving in a perfect 2d plane .",
    "the dependence of the properties of a @xmath0 system on the position of the donor with respect to the center has been partly investigated by marmorkos _",
    "et al._@xcite they considered the problem of a double quantum well in which one of the two wells hosts , in its center , the donor , while the other contains the electrons . on the experimental side we point out the work of jiang",
    "_ et al._@xcite in which experimental evidence of an off - center @xmath0 system was presented .",
    "all these studies on off - center and barrier @xmath0 show spin - singlet spin - triplet transitions of the ground state with increasing strength of the magnetic field .",
    "but the situation studied in previous works differs from the real problem of the off - center @xmath0 .",
    "the work of zhu _ et al . _ is most close to the real experimental situation but they studied only the first two state of the @xmath0 system .",
    "such singlet - triplet transitions have also been observed in electron systems confined in quantum dots and are known as _ magic magnetic number _ ground state transitions . @xcite in quantum dots the electrons are held together by a parabolic or hard wall confinement potential which for the @xmath0 problem is replaced by the coulomb potential of the donor impurity .",
    "thus it seems that the appearance of singlet - triplet transitions is a characteristic feature of confined electronic systems , and in this paper we will shed more light on the condition under which such transitions appear in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the @xmath0 problem has the added flexibility that the singlet - triplet transition can be influenced by changing the position of the donor with respect to the center of the quantum well .",
    "it is even possible that for certain donor positions there is no singlet - triplet transition at all .    in the present paper",
    "we study the properties of the off - center @xmath0 as function of the position of the donor in the well , and as function of the quantum well width in the quasi-2d approximation . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ]",
    "the properties of the off - center @xmath0 in a finite - height quantum well under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field will be treated in the present paper . in the frame of the effective mass approximation the hamiltonian of the @xmath0 system",
    "is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian for the i - th one electron @xmath3   system and @xmath6 is the electron - electron repulsive coulomb interaction .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates and the effective bohr radius , @xmath7 , and the effective rydberg , @xmath8 , as units of length and energy respectively , the neutral donor hamiltonian @xmath9 and the electron - electron coulomb potential assume the form @xmath10 where the vector potential is taken in the symmetric gauge @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic field is expressed in the dimensionless quantity @xmath12 with @xmath13 the cyclotron frequency ; @xmath14 is the position of the donor along the z - axis as measured from the center of the well and @xmath15 is the confining potential due to the quantum well of width w. for @xmath16 with @xmath17 we took @xmath18 and obtain @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "we took the mass of the electron equal in the well and in the barrier , namely @xmath22 , and the height of the barrier is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the strong confinement along the z - axis allows to neglect the correlation induced by the coulomb interaction in the @xmath24-direction , thus we can write the wave functions for the @xmath0 as follows @xmath25 with @xmath26 the 1d ground state wave function for the electron confined in a quantum well of height @xmath27.@xcite    the two - electron function @xmath28 expresses the correlation between the two electrons and is obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ dm - hamil ] ) in which the electron - electron , @xmath6 , and the electron - donor , @xmath29 , coulomb interaction are replaced by their average along the @xmath24-axis , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . in a previous work @xcite",
    "it has been shown that in the case of hard wall confinement eq .",
    "( [ e - e ] ) can be replaced by the expression @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the modified bessel function of the third kind . in the present paper",
    "we use the same expression for a finite height quantum well in which @xmath35 is determined by fitting eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ e - e ] ) . a comparison between the potential ( [ e - e ] ) that was evaluated numerically and the approximate expression ( [ approx ] ) is shown in fig .",

    "none of the two fits give a good approximation to eq .",
    "( [ e - d ] ) in the small @xmath43 region .",
    "therefore , we retain in the hamiltonian the numerical expression for eq .",
    "( [ e - d ] ) .    using a finite difference technique , as explained in ref .",
    "12 , the schr@xmath44dinger equation associated to the hamiltonian ( [ dz - hamil ] ) was numerically solved on a non - uniform grid in @xmath45-space and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors , @xmath46 for the @xmath3 were found for different values of @xmath14 and arbitrary magnetic field strength .",
    "the eigenfunctions for the @xmath0 can then be constructed as a linear combination of the @xmath3 wave functions . due to the rotational symmetry in the @xmath45-plane of the hamiltonian ( [ dz - hamil ] )",

    "first we solve our model for an off - center donor in a @xmath51 quantum well with width @xmath39 ( @xmath52 ) and height of the potential barrier @xmath53 .",
    "the dependence of the energy on the position of the donor with respect to the center of the well is investigated numerically .",
    "the binding energy of the @xmath0 state with @xmath54-component of the orbital angular momentum equal to l is defined as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the energy of the ground state of the @xmath3 in the well , @xmath57 is the energy of a free electron in the @xmath58 landau level and @xmath59 is the @xmath60-th energy level of the @xmath0 with l the @xmath54-component of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the results of our numerical calculation are plotted in fig .",
    "[ bind - energ ] for @xmath39 .",
    "the binding energies of the first l=0 state , a spin - singlet , and of the state l=-1 , a spin - triplet , are plotted against the magnetic field for different positions , @xmath14 , of the donor with respect to the center of the well .",
    "we note , first , that the binding energy decreases when the donor center is displaced from the center of the quantum well .",
    "the reason is that the electron - donor interaction decreases with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "this is because , due to the strong confinement along the growth axis of the well , the electrons tend , even in the case of an off - center donor system , to be localized in the center of the quantum well although the donor is displaced a distance @xmath14 from the center .",
    "a second feature to be noted is that the magnetic field dependence of the binding energy changes qualitatively with increasing @xmath14 . for sufficiently large @xmath14",
    "we find that @xmath61 has a maximum as function of @xmath62 .",
    "the binding energy starts to decrease after this maximum and for sufficiently large @xmath62 it can even become negative , indicating an unbinding of the @xmath0 state .",
    "third , in the absence of a magnetic field the ground state of the @xmath0 is , regardless of the position of the donor , the spin - singlet state .",
    "when increasing the magnetic field , the ground state for a well - center @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath63 , remains the singlet one .",
    "in contrast , the ground state of the off - center @xmath0 with @xmath64 shows a transition to a spin - triplet state for large enough magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic field at which the singlet - triplet transition occurs depends on the position of the donor as it appears from fig .",
    "[ bind - energ ] .",
    "this dependence will be studied further below where it is found that the magnetic field at which the transition occurs decreases with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "larsen and coworkers @xcite investigated the ideal 2d problem , neglecting the finite extension of the electron wave function in the z - direction , i.e. @xmath65 , and calculated the @xmath0 spectrum for a donor out of the plane in the limit of high magnetic fields and found an infinite number of singlet - triplet transitions .",
    "the situation for a quasi-2d off - center @xmath0 is quite different . in this case , in contrast to the 2d case , the extension of the electron wave function in the z - direction is taken into account , together with the finite height of the barrier .",
    "let us investigate deeper the behavior of the energy spectrum of such a system , with e.g. @xmath38 .",
    "the results for the binding energy of the different levels , i.e. different angular momentum states , are shown in fig .",
    "[ .7](_a _ ) , for the case of a quantum well of width @xmath39 .",
    "note that different transitions occur at higher magnetic fields .",
    "the ground state exhibits a singlet - triplet transition at @xmath66 and a triplet - singlet transition at @xmath67 . for @xmath68 which corresponds to @xmath69 the @xmath0 ground state unbinds , i.e. the @xmath0 _ magnetically evaporates_.    while for the ideal 2d system an infinite number of singlet - triplet transitions",
    "are found for a quasi-2d system only a finite number of such transitions are possible as is clearly visible from fig .",
    "[ .7](_a , b _ ) .",
    "the critical @xmath62 s at which the singlet @xmath70 triplet transitions occur depend on the position of the donor ( see fig . [ .7](_b _ ) ) . the @xmath71 phase diagram for the ground state of a quantum well of width @xmath39",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ g.vs.zeta ] .",
    "we found that for @xmath72 the ground state is a singlet for all magnetic fields , for @xmath73 only one singlet - triplet transition ( see fig .",
    "[ g.vs.zeta ] ) is possible and for @xmath74 there are two of such transitions . increasing @xmath14 further such that the donor is in the barrier ( i.e. @xmath75 ) , the number of singlet - triplet transition does not increase as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ .7](_b _ ) for a @xmath0 with @xmath76 .    the physical origin of the singlet - triplet transitions is related to the decrease of the electron - donor attraction with the displacement of the donor from the center of the well when compared to the constant electron - electron repulsion . the corresponding electron - donor and electron - electron in - plane potentials are shown in fig . [ repul - attrac ] for two values of @xmath77 . for small values of @xmath14 ( e.g. @xmath78 in fig",
    "[ repul - attrac ] ) the attractive single electron - donor potential is larger than the electron - electron potential and consequently the @xmath0 system prefers a configuration in which the two electrons are as close as possible to the donor in order to enhance the binding energy , i.e. the l=0 state is favored .",
    "when @xmath77 is sufficiently large ( e.g. @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ repul - attrac ] ) the repulsive electron - electron interaction dominates the attractive single - donor potential at small distances and the @xmath0 can have bound states only when the two electrons are sufficiently apart to render the repulsive inter - electrons interaction lower or of the same order as the attractive electron - donor potential . for small magnetic fields this can still be realized in the l=0 state .",
    "increasing the magnetic field brings the electrons closer to @xmath80 which will also increase the electron - electron repulsive energy . for sufficiently small",
    "@xmath14 this can still be compensated by the attractive electron - donor energy . for @xmath14",
    "sufficiently large the electron - electron repulsive energy increases faster then the electron - donor energy with increasing @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath0 system can decrease its energy in this case by placing the electrons further apart which is achieved by placing the electrons in higher l - states .",
    "similar singlet - triplet transitions have been found recently in quantum dots systems.@xcite the quantum dot system is an extreme case in which the electron - donor potential is replaced by the confinement potential which is usually taken of a quadratic form , i.e. @xmath82 .    in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] the pair - correlation function @xmath83(_a _ ) ) and spin - triplet l=-1 ( fig .",
    "[ correlation](_b _ ) ) states for different values of the magnetic field for an on - center ( i.e. @xmath84 ) and for an off - center ( i.e. @xmath79 ) @xmath0 system .",
    "the magnetic field behavior of the two states is essentially the same for both the center and the off - center @xmath0 system .",
    "the magnetic field tends to localize more the wave function with increasing magnetic field . for the l=0 state",
    "the pair correlation function becomes more and more peaked at @xmath80 , this means that the electrons are more and more close to each other with increasing magnetic fields . for the l=-1 ,",
    "the peak of the correlation function is shifted towards @xmath85 with increasing @xmath81 , and thus , the magnetic field localizes the electrons further .",
    "the effect of the electron - electron repulsion can be seen in the shape of the correlation function itself . for the off - center system",
    "the pair - correlation function is broader than the one for the center @xmath0 system even for increasing magnetic fields and thus the electrons tend to repel each other more , which is a consequence of the diminished electron - donor interaction .    when the dimension of the well is reduced the localization of the electrons in the center of the well is increased .",
    "for example , if we neglect the penetration of the electrons in the barrier , the width of the @xmath86 is equal to @xmath87 . thus the electron - electron repulsion increases and at the same time , for the off - center case , the electron spends more time far from the position where the donor is located .",
    "thus , we expect that systems with a smaller well width will show more spin - singlet to spin - triplet transitions with increasing magnetic field , and that these transitions will occur at smaller fields .",
    "indeed , for a @xmath88 quantum well , with again @xmath38 , we observe ( see fig . [ 100.7 ] ) as much as 4 transitions before the @xmath0 evaporates at a magnetic field of @xmath89 ( i.e. @xmath90 ) .",
    "the full phase - diagram for those transitions is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ii ] . the well width dependence of the singlet - triplet transitions and of the evaporation magnetic field are shown in fig .",
    "[ wellw ] for @xmath91 .",
    "notice that the critical magnetic field for the same transitions , e.g. for the spin - singlet l=0 to spin - triplet l=-1 state , decreases with decreasing well width . at the same time",
    "the number of transitions increases .",
    "but the evaporation magnetic field first decreases and then for @xmath92 increases again .",
    "an explanation of this feature is that other transitions are allowed for small well width and this ensure stability of the @xmath0 up to higher magnetic fields .",
    "the increase of the number of singlet - triplet transitions with decreasing dimensions of the quantum well , explains the larger number of transitions found by larsen _",
    "@xcite in the ideal 2d system with respect to the smaller number found in the present study of realistic quasi-2d systems .",
    "the oscillator strength for cyclotron transitions , in the present units , is defined as @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 are , respectively , the final and initial - state energies and @xmath96 , @xmath97 are , respectively , the final and initial - state wave functions . the @xmath98 sign in eq .",
    "( [ oscillator ] ) refers to circular left / right polarization of the light .",
    "note that the perturbation induced by the electric field is spin - independent , thus the initial and final - states conserve the total spin , i.e. they are both spin - triplet or both spin - singlet states .",
    "( [ oscillator ] ) leads to the selection rules @xmath99 , while no selection rule is present for the quantum number n.    we have studied the oscillator strength for cyclotron resonance transitions from the first singlet l=0 state - ( n , l , s)=(1,0,0 ) - to the ( 1,-1,0 ) and the ( 1,1,0 ) states in the range 2 - 15 t .",
    "the transition energies and oscillator strengths , for @xmath38 , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ tran - sin ] against the magnetic field and are compared to the one for @xmath100 we recall that for a two - electron atom the oscillator strength satisfies the sum - rule @xmath101 .",
    "we observe that the off - center and the center @xmath0 have rather similar qualitative magnetic field dependences .",
    "cyclotron resonance transition from the ground state should show a discontinuous behavior in the cyclotron transition energies as a function of the magnetic field at the singlet - triplet transition points . in fig .",
    "[ 85 ] the transition energies for a donor at position @xmath102 are shown . respectively , the transition energies for @xmath103 and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are plotted .",
    "the solid curve shows the transition energy which we expect to observe if the system makes a cyclotron resonance transition starting from the ground state .",
    "thus steps in the cyclotron resonance energy should be observed at those magnetic fields at which the singlet - triplet transition takes place . in real experiments ,",
    "as we will see later , not always transitions only from the ground state are seen in the neighborhood of the critical field which is due to the fact that in a real experiment the temperature is non zero . indeed , when the _ old _ ground - state , i.e. the state that was before the transition the ground - state , and the _ new _ ground - state , i.e. the state that is after the transition the ground - state , have a comparable binding energy they can both be thermally populated .",
    "in this section we present a comparison between our theoretical results and the experimental data reported by jiang _ et al._@xcite the experiment of jiang _ et al .",
    "_ was performed on multi - layers of @xmath106 with well width of 200 and barrier width of 600 .",
    "such a system can be considered as an ensemble of single quantum wells .",
    "the wells were nominally @xmath107-doped at 3/4 of the distance between the center of the well and its edge . in the model discussed in this paper",
    "this means that @xmath108 .    a comparison between the theoretical and the experimental transition energies is reported in fig .",
    "[ expdata ] .",
    "the observed transitions are the @xmath3 @xmath109 and the @xmath0 singlet @xmath110 and triplet @xmath104 transitions .",
    "our theoretical results are given by the three different curves .",
    "note that our results fit well the data at low magnetic fields .",
    "the deviations between theory and experiment observed for @xmath111 can be attributed to band non - parabolicity and polaron effects .",
    "both effects decrease the transition energy@xcite but are not taken in account in this paper .    in cyclotron resonance experiments",
    "the integrated absorption intensities can be measured .",
    "the integrated absorption intensities are proportional to the oscillator strength times the population densities of the levels involved in the transition . to compare our results with the experimental data we have to make an assumption on the form of the population density .",
    "we assume that only the initial level of the transition is populated .",
    "thus for the off - center @xmath0 the population density of the level is proportional to @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the binding energy of the initial state .",
    "we remark that for off center @xmath0 in this range of magnetic fields the energies of the triplet and the singlet states are comparable . for the well - center @xmath0 , instead , we consider only the l=0 spin - singlet state to be populated , i.e. the population density is 1 .",
    "the results for the relative integrated intensities of the singlet transition as evaluated in our calculation and the experimental results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ oscill ] and are in good agreement , both for the well - center as well as for the off - center @xmath0 .",
    "the temperature in the experiment was @xmath114 .",
    "note that the different magnetic field dependence for the center @xmath0 ( i.e. increase with b ) and for the off - center @xmath0 ( i.e. decrease with b ) is correctly described .",
    "the errors bars for the off - center intensities are rather large . a slight discrepancy is observed at certain values of the magnetic field for the off - center @xmath0 but we observe that moving the donor in our model slightly closer to the center of the well , i.e. @xmath115 , the relative integrated intensity changes from the solid to the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ oscill ] and now matches the experimental data in the magnetic fields region in which there was not such a good agreement before .",
    "thus the apparent discrepancy in the integrated intensity , with @xmath116 , in the range @xmath117 is explained by considering a small distribution of donors around the point of intended @xmath118-doping .",
    "we presented a theoretical study of the off - center @xmath0 , where special attention was paid to the dependence of the binding energy on the well width and the donor position .",
    "we found that the magnetic field induces spin - singlet to spin - triplet transitions in the ground - state of the off - center @xmath0 .",
    "the number of those transitions depends _ both _ on the position of the donor and on the width of the well .",
    "in contrast to the ideal 2d system and to quantum dots only a finite number of transitions are found .",
    "if the donor is near the center of the quantum well no such singlet - triplet transitions occur .",
    "when such singlet - triplet transitions occur we find that at sufficiently large magnetic field the @xmath0 system becomes unbound and consequently one observes a magnetic evaporation of the @xmath0 system .",
    "we calculated also the oscillator strength for the off - center @xmath0 as function of the magnetic field and compared it to the results for a center @xmath0 .",
    "we restrain ourselves to the study of the optical transitions @xmath119 , @xmath103 , and we observed that the off - center and the center @xmath0 have similar magnetic behaviour .",
    "our results were used to explain the experimental results recently reported by jiang _",
    "et al . _ on the cyclotron resonance transition energy and the absorption intensity of the off - center @xmath0 system for magnetic fields up to @xmath120 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the @xmath0 center is a natural quantum dot system which is confined by the coulomb potential of the impurity and consequently is more closely related to real atomic systems .",
    "a remarkable feature of the @xmath0 centers in quantum wells is the controllability of the effective confinement potential which is platzmann - like for a donor in the center of the well and screened coulomb - like when the donor is placed far away from the quantum well center . in the latter case",
    "the potential is parabolic near the center of the quantum well plane and thus resembles the confinement potential of quantum dots . in this case",
    "singlet - triplet transitions are found as function of the magnetic field .",
    "a crucial difference with the quantum dots is that only a finite number of such a transitions occur and that for sufficiently large magnetic fields the @xmath0 system becomes unbound , i.e. magnetically evaporates .",

    "<S> we investigate the effect of the position of the donor in the quantum well on the energy spectrum and the oscillator strength of the @xmath0 system in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field . as a function of the magnetic field we find that when @xmath0 centers are placed sufficiently off - center they undergo singlet - triplet transitions which are similar to those found in many - electron parabolic quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that the number of such transitions depend on the position of the donor and only a finite number of such singlet - triplet transitions are found as function of the strength of the magnetic field . for sufficiently large magnetic fields </S>",
    "<S> the two electron system becomes unbound . for the near center @xmath0 system no singlet - triplet and no unbinding of the @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is found with increasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field vs. donor position phase diagram is presented that depends on the width of the quantum well . </S>"
