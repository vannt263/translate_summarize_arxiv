    "@xcite ( hereinafter cgd ) studied the interaction of @xmath0-mode plane - wave packets with a sunspot using time - distance helioseismology . as we shall describe briefly below , the data averaging strategy used by cgd",
    "greatly reduces the noise and enables a detailed study of the waveforms far from the scattering region . in this study , we extend the observations to modes with different radial orders and wavelengths that are closer to the sunspot radius , in order to investigate finite - wavelength effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "not only do we measure traveltime shifts but also wave amplitude perturbations with respect to the quiet sun .",
    "we use one - minute cadence doppler velocity images measured by the michelson doppler imager @xcite onboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho / mdi ) .",

    "the map scale is @xmath1 heliographic degrees per pixel .",
    "nine data sets are obtained , one for each day of the period 2028 january 2002 .",

    "five different filters are applied , for modes @xmath0 through @xmath6 ( corresponding to radial orders @xmath74 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : char ] lists the characteristics of the wave packets for each radial order , including the central frequency , @xmath8 , and the central wavelength , @xmath9 . broadly speaking",
    ", the finite - wavelength effects are expected to be observable in the regime where @xmath10 approaches unity ( this condition will be refined in section  [ sec : heal ] ) .",
    "these effects should thus be easier to see with the @xmath6 wave packet .",
    "the cross - covariance of the filtered doppler velocity is computed in the same way as in cgd : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a local cartesian coordinate system with origin at the center of the sunspot , @xmath13 is the time , @xmath14 is the filtered doppler velocity for modes with radial order @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the average of @xmath14 over the line @xmath17 at @xmath18  mm . the spacial averaging over @xmath17 is equivalent to filtering out all the wavevectors that are not perpendicular to @xmath17 : only waves that propagate toward and away from @xmath17 contribute to @xmath16 .    as explained by @xcite , for @xmath19 ,",
    "the cross - covariance is used to follow the propagation of two plane wave packets initially at @xmath17 and propagating toward @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the interaction of the waves with the sunspot will occur in the @xmath22 quadrant .    to reduce noise ,",
    "the cross - covariances are averaged over nine days and over azimuthal angle about the sunspot center ( see cgd ) .",

    ", we fit the peak nearest to @xmath28 with a parabola to measure the time shift . in this particular example , the time shift and reduced amplitude are @xmath29  s and @xmath30 with respect to quiet sun . [ fig : fcc ] ]    we define the traveltime shift , @xmath31 , as the time - lag that maximizes the similarity between the measured cross - covariance , @xmath32 , and a sliding quiet - sun cross - covariance , @xmath33 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath26 is the time @xmath34 that maximizes the function @xmath35 the quiet - sun cross - covariance @xmath33 is constructed by averaging @xmath32 over @xmath36  mm , far away from the region of wave scattering , and it is zeroed out for @xmath37 .",
    "the cross - correlation traveltime shift defined here is also used in geophysics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is analogous to the definition of @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation @xmath38 at each spatial point @xmath12 as a function of @xmath34 is demodulated using the hilbert transform to obtain its envelope .",
    "the maximum , @xmath39 , of the envelope of @xmath38 is a measure of the wave packet amplitude . by definition",

    "an example measurement of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath40 at @xmath24  mm ( after interaction with the sunspot ) is shown in figure  [ fig : fcc ] .",
    "for each wavepacket , we obtain spatial maps of the traveltime shift @xmath31 and wave amplitude @xmath39 , shown in figure  [ fig : map ] .",
    "the maps of @xmath26 clearly show negative traveltime anomalies behind the sunspot along @xmath41 while the maps of @xmath27 show the amplitude reductions .",
    "we only display the results for distances from @xmath17 larger than three wavelengths in each panel in order to exclude the near field where the @xmath37 and @xmath19 branches of @xmath42 are not well separated .",
    "this is not a limitation of this work as we are interested in wave scattering in the far field . for @xmath0 and @xmath3 modes",
    "there are positive traveltime anomalies on the left side of the penumbra , which are likely to be caused by the outward - directed flows in the penumbra and the moat .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : map ] show that the transmitted wave packets have a reduced amplitude around @xmath41 compared to the quiet - sun value , for all radial orders .",
    "it is known that wave absorption by sunspots causes a reduction in outgoing wave amplitude @xcite , as the result of partial mode conversion of incoming waves into slow magnetoacoustic waves that propagate down the sunspot ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in our case ( plane wave geometry )",
    ", a significant fraction of the amplitude reduction that is observed on - axis behind the sunspot is due to the defocusing of wave energy by the fast wave - speed perturbation introduced by the sunspot .",
    "this can be illustrated by a simple 2d ray tracing experiment shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : a ] .",
    "this `` geometrical attenuation '' will contribute to the wave amplitude reduction in addition to the physical absorption of waves .",
    "their respective contributions would require better modeling as ray tracing can not take account of wavefront healing .",
    "apart from the on - axis amplitude reduction , an enhancement of wave amplitude is seen away from the axis @xmath41 for modes @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( bottom panels in figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "this off - path enhancement is more pronounced for the @xmath6 wave packet ( right panel of figure  [ fig : a ] ) .",
    "like above , we suggest that this off - path feature is caused by sunspot - induced refraction .",
    "since rays tend to bend toward the slow - speed medium , diffracted rays will cross over the unperturbed rays on both sides off the central axis .",
    "the envelope of the bundle of intersected rays is called a caustic in optics .",
    "the wavefronts fold and triplicate as they pass through the caustics . inside the caustics",
    ", all three arrivals will contribute to cross - correlation traveltime measurements and the interpretation of traveltime becomes ambiguous under the ray - theoretical picture @xcite .",
    "the location of the caustics depends on the perturbation strength and the sunspot geometry . in the case of @xmath6 modes ,",
    "a 10% wave - speed perturbation provides a rather satisfying explanation for the on - axis power deficit and off - path enhancement ( left panel of figure  [ fig : a ] ) .",
    "we note that the off - path enhancements are also seen in the cross - covariance power maps ( not shown here ) , though not as clearly .",
    "we have measured the traveltime shifts and amplitudes of plane wave packets as they traverse a sunspot using a cross - covariance technique .",
    "observations show on - axis wavefront healing and amplitude reduction .",
    "traveltime anomalies spread in the transverse direction with distance and amplitude enhancements are seen away from the central ray .",
    "wavefront healing is a finite - wavelength phenomenon .",
    "the only other direct observational evidence of finite - wavelength effects in time - distance helioseismology was reported by @xcite who studied the interaction of waves with sub - wavelength magnetic features .",
    "wavefront healing can not be modelled by ray theory .",
    "this implies that ray - based interpretations are not always appropriate in sunspot seismology .",
    "we have seen that ray - tracing ( unlike linearized ray theory ) is quite useful to study the geometrical attenuation due to the defocusing of wave energy by a fast wave - speed anomaly .",
    "we conclude that wave amplitude reduction is not necessarily due to wave absorption by the sunspot .",
    "ray tracing is also useful to interpret off - path amplitude enhancements due to wavefront folding , although it can not explain wavefront healing .",
    "the observations of traveltime shifts and wave amplitude that have been presented in this paper contain a wealth of information about the seismic signature of sunspots .",
    "their interpretation requires methods of analysis more sophisticated than linearized ray theory ( which is still often used in sunspot seismology today ) .",
