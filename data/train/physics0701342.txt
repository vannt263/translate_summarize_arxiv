    "in this paper we suggest and discuss a new type of a powerful source of high energy photons generated by a bunch of ultra - relativistic electrons undergoing planar channeling in a periodically bent crystal .",
    "we call such system an electron - based crystalline undulator .",
    "the feasibility of the undulator has been recently proven for the first time in @xcite . in this work",
    "the results of more detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the radiation formed in electron - based crystalline undulators at different energies of electron and for different types of crystals are presented .    as it is known @xcite , in a crystalline undulator there appears , in addition to the well - known channeling radiation @xcite , the radiation of an undulator type which is due to the periodic motion of channeling particles which follow the bending of the crystallographic planes .",
    "in the cited papers , as well as in the subsequent publications @xcite , a feasibility to create a short - wave crystalline undulator emitting intensive and monochromatic radiation , based on an ultra - relativistic positron channeling was proven ( for the latest review see @xcite ) .",
    "more recently@xcite it was shown that the brilliance of the radiation from a positron - based crystalline undulator in the energy range from hundreds of kev up to tens of mev is comparable to that of a conventional light source of the third generation but for much lower photon energies .",
    "experimental study of this phenomenon is on the way within the framework of the pecu project @xcite .    )",
    "which are periodically bent .",
    "the wavy lines show the trajectories of channeling particles . a positron channels between two neighbouring planes , whereas the electron channeling occurs nearby the crystallographic plane .",
    "the profile of periodic bending is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the period and amplitude of the bending ( indicated in graph ( a ) ) . ]    the operational principle of a crystalline undulator does not depend on the type of a projectile and is illustrated by figure [ figure.1 ] . under certain conditions",
    "@xcite an ultra - relativistic charged particle , which enters the crystal at the angle smaller than the lindhard s critical angle @xcite , will penetrate through the crystal following the bendings of its planes .",
    "consequently , the trajectory of the particle contains two elements .",
    "firstly , there are oscillations due to the action of the interplanar force , - the channeling oscillations@xcite , whose frequency @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the speed of light ) depends on the energy of the particle @xmath5 and the parameters of the channel : the maximal gradient of the interplanar potential @xmath6 and the interplanar distance @xmath7 . secondly , there are oscillations due to the periodicity of the bendings , the undulator oscillations , whose frequency is @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the spatial period of bending . the spontaneous emission is associated with both of these oscillations .",
    "typical frequencies of the channeling and undulator radiation are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the lorentz factor of the particle and @xmath12 is the undulator parameter , @xmath2 is the amplitude of bending . if @xmath13 , then the frequencies of channeling and undulator radiation are well separated . in this case",
    "the characteristics of undulator radiation are practically independent on channeling oscillations@xcite , and the operational principle of a crystalline undulator is the same as for a conventional one@xcite , in which the monochromaticity of the radiation is the result of a constructive interference of the photons emitted from similar parts of trajectory .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a crystalline undulator can operate provided the following conditions are met : @xmath14   &    \\mbox { - account for dechanneling and photon attenuation } ,   \\\\",
    "\\delta \\varepsilon/ \\varepsilon\\ll 1 & \\mbox { - low radiative losses}.   \\label{equation.1 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] earlier , it was demonstrated that these conditions can be achieved in a positron - based undulator@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we demonstrate this for an electron - based one . prior to doing this",
    "let us present a short description of the physics lying behind these conditions .",
    "a stable channeling of a projectile in a periodically bent channel occurs if the maximal centrifugal force in the channel @xmath15 is less than the maximal interplanar force @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath16 . for an ultra - relativistic particle @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the minimum curvature radius of the channel with the profile of the periodical bendings given by @xmath0 ( see ) .",
    "the operation of a crystalline undulator must be considered in the large - amplitude regime . omitting the discussion ( see @xcite )",
    "we note , that the limit @xmath19 accompanied by the condition @xmath20 is mostly advantageous , since in this case the typical frequencies of undulator and channeling radiation are well separated , and the latter does not affect the parameters of the former , whereas the intensity of the undulator radiation becomes comparable or higher than that of the channeling radiation . on the other hand",
    ", the inequality @xmath21 means that the crystal structure is not destroyed and the deformation is an elastic one . also",
    ", this results in moderate values of the undulator parameter , @xmath22 , which ensure that the emitted radiation is of the undulator type rather than of the synchrotron one .",
    "consequently , the quantities @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 must satisfy the double inequality presented in the second line in ( [ equation.1 ] ) .",
    "the term undulator signifies that the number of periods is large , @xmath23 .",
    "this inequality leads to a very peculiar pattern of a spectral - angular distribution of the emitted radiation .",
    "namely , for each value of the emission angle @xmath24 ( measured with respect to the undulator axis ) the spectrum consists of a set of narrow , well - separated peaks ( harmonics ) . in a conventional undulator , based on the action of a magnetic ( or electric ) field @xcite , the beams of charged particles and photons move in vacuum . in such ideal conditions",
    "the peak intensity of the emitted radiation is proportional to @xmath25 .    in a crystalline undulator",
    "the beams move in a medium and are affected by the dechanneling and photon attenuation effects , which noticeably reduce the @xmath26 increase of the peak intensity @xcite .",
    "due to collisions with the crystal constituents the channeling particle increases its transverse energy @xmath27 . at some point @xmath27",
    "exceeds the interplanar potential barrier and leaves the channel .",
    "the average interval for a particle to penetrate into a crystal until it dechannels is called the dechanneling length @xmath28 . in a straight crystal @xmath28",
    "depends on its type , the energy and the type of a projectile .",
    "in addition to these , in a periodically bent crystal @xmath28 acquires the dependence on the parameter @xmath29@xcite .",
    "the dechanneling length introduces a natural upper limit on the length of a crystalline undulator : @xmath30 .",
    "the essential difference between an electron - based undulator and a positron - based one lies in the fact that the dechanneling process for these projectiles occurs differently , resulting in a strong inequality @xmath31@xcite .",
    "we discuss this important issue in more detail in .",
    "the photon attenuation stands for a decrease of the intensity of the emitted radiation in the crystal due to the processes of absorption and scattering .",
    "the interval within which the intensity decreases by a factor of @xmath32 is called the attenuation length , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this quantity is tabulated for a number of elements and over wide ranges of photon frequencies @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that for sufficiently high photon energies ( @xmath34 kev ) the restriction on the length of undulator due to the photon attenuation effect becomes much less severe than to the dechanneling process @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that in the limit @xmath35 the intensity of radiation is defined not by the total number of undulator periods @xmath36 , but rather by the quantity @xmath37 which is the number of periods within the dechanneling length . since for an ultra - relativistic particle @xmath38 @xcite , it seems natural that to increase @xmath39 one can consider higher energies .",
    "however , at higher energies another limitation appears @xcite .",
    "the coherence of undulator radiation is only possible when the energy loss @xmath40 of the particle during its passage through the undulator is small , @xmath41 .",
    "this statement together with the fact , that for an ultra - relativistic projectile @xmath40 is mainly due to radiation @xcite , leads to the conclusion that @xmath42 must be much smaller than the radiation length @xmath43 , which defines the mean energy loss of an ultra - relativistic particle per unit length ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we come to the forth and fifth limitations in ( [ equation.1 ] ) .    a thorough analysis of the conditions ( [ equation.1 ] ) for the system `` periodically bent crystal + ultra - relativistic positrons '' was performed for the first time in @xcite ( and analyzed further in @xcite ) .",
    "the ranges of @xmath44 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 for a number of crystals were established within which the operation of the crystalline undulator is possible .",
    "these ranges include @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 kev and are common for all investigated crystals .",
    "the importance of the above mentioned regime in application to a positron - based undulator was later realized by other authors @xcite .    in the case of electron",
    "channeling the restriction due to the dechanneling effect on the parameters of undulator are much more severe @xcite .",
    "therefore it has been commonly acknowledged that the concept of an electron - based undulator can not be realized . in what follows",
    "we demonstrate that the crystalline undulator of this type is feasible but operates in the regime of higher beam energies than the positron - based undulator .",
    "as mentioned , random multiple scattering of a channeling particle by electrons and nuclei of the crystal leads to the dechanneling effect . as a result ,",
    "the volume density @xmath50 of the channeling particles decreases with the penetration distance @xmath51 .",
    "the dependence @xmath50 can be approximated as @xmath52 @xcite , where @xmath53 is the density at the entrance point .",
    "it follows from here that the dechanneling length @xmath54 is a natural limitation for the effective length of a crystalline undulator @xcite .",
    "therefore , the crystalline undulator is feasible when @xmath55 is large enough to ensure that the number of undulator periods within the dechanneling length satisfies the condition @xmath56 .",
    "it is known that the dechanneling length of positrons exceeds that of electrons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the difference in the channeling processes for these projectiles .",
    "indeed , positrons , possessing positive charge , are repulsed by crystal atoms and , thus , channel between neighbouring crystallographic planes ( see ( a ) ) , where the concentration of nuclei and electrons is low .",
    "in contrast , electrons channel in close vicinity of atomic planes ( ( b ) ) where the number of the collisions with the crystal constituents is much larger .",
    "therefore , electrons dechannel faster .",
    "let us discuss the approximations which one can use to calculate the dechanneling lengths of a positron and an electron .",
    "the influence of the dechanneling process on the photon emission in a positron - based crystalline undulator was considered in @xcite . in",
    "the cited works the expression for the dechanneling length of ultra - relativistic positrons in a periodically bent crystal , based of the diffusion model@xcite , was written as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dechanneling length a straight channel .",
    "this quantity can be estimated as @xmath59 @xcite , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the classical radius of the electron and the thomas - fermi radius of the crystal atom , and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 stands for an average ionization potential of the atom ) .",
    "the factor @xmath64 takes into account the decrease of the interplanar potential well due to periodic bendings .",
    "the advantage of the approximate formula is that it explicitly demonstrates the dependence of the dechanneling length on @xmath29 , @xmath5 and parameters of the channel .",
    "equation ( [ equation.2 ] ) was tested in @xcite against more rigorous calculations , based on the simulation procedure of the positron channeling in straight and bent crystals .",
    "it was demonstrated that in wide range of the parameters produces a good quantitative estimate for @xmath55 .    to estimate the dechanneling length for electrons , one can use the model due to baier and katkov @xcite which relates @xmath58 to a mean square of the multiple scattering angle of an ultra - relativistic electron . since electrons channel in close vicinity of atomic planes , the multiple scattering occur predominantly from the nuclei of the crystal .",
    "the latter makes the main contribution to the increase of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath65 denote the mean square of the multiple scattering angle per a unit length .",
    "then , @xmath58 can be defined as the length within which the mean square of the multiple scattering angle becomes equal to the square of lindhard angle @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 taking into account that individual scattering events are independent and using the small - angle scattering approximation at high energies@xcite , one estimates @xmath65 as follows@xcite @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the fine structure constant , @xmath70 is the radiation length in an amorphous medium . using in and recalling that @xmath71 ( @xmath72 stands for the depth of the interplanar potential well ) , one derives the following expression for the dechanneling length of an ultra - relativistic electron in a straight crystal @xcite @xmath73",
    "this equation has been derived assuming that the dechanneling length of ultra - relativistic electrons in a straight crystal is less than the characteristic length of the radiation losses @xcite .",
    "as far as we know ( see also @xcite ) , experimental measurements of the dechanneling length during planar channeling of high energy electrons were performed in @xcite . in @xcite the dechanneling length for 1.2 gev electrons , channeled in si(110 ) was determined as @xmath74 m .",
    "this value , as indicated in @xcite , is in a good agreement with .",
    "however , in the experiment @xcite the dechanneling length for 350 mev electrons channeled in si(110 ) was found as @xmath75 m , which is even greater than the value based on ( [ equation.5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that the approximate formula can be used for a quantitative estimate of the dechanneling length of ultra - relativistic electrons in straight crystals .    presents the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath5 for planar channeling of electrons , calculated in accordance with , and of positrons ( see for @xmath76 ) in various straight channels .",
    "horizontal lines show the radiation length in the crystals . to calculate @xmath70 we used equation ( 27.22 ) from @xcite .",
    "it is seen from that for all energies the dechanneling length for a positron exceeds that for an electron by more than an order of magnitude : @xmath77 .",
    "a positron - based crystalline undulator can be considered for @xmath78 gev , where the radiation length greatly exceeds @xmath28 .",
    "one can demonstrate that in this case it is possible to achieve @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values of the undulator period are @xmath80 cm . from it",
    "is seen that this is exactly the interval to which @xmath81 belongs . therefore , for an electron of the energy much smaller than 10 gev the number of undulator periods within the dechanneling length is equal , in the order of magnitude , to one .",
    "hence , an electron - based crystalline undulator can hardly be realized in this energy regime .        for higher energies , @xmath82 gev ,",
    "the dechanneling length of a positron becomes comparable with the radiation length .",
    "this means , that a positron - based crystalline undulator can not be realized due to large radiation losses ( see the last condition in ) . on the other hand",
    ", the dechanneling length of electrons at such energies , being much lower than @xmath70 , becomes comparable with @xmath28 for positrons but of lower energies .",
    "therefore , an electron - based crystalline undulator is meaningful to discuss within the interval @xmath83 gev .    to conclude this section",
    "let us discuss a model which allows one to define the dechanneling length of an electron in a _ periodically bent _ crystal .",
    "the factor @xmath64 in appears as a result of application of the harmonic approximation for interplanar potential @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this approximation is adequate for a positively charged projectile , but its validity is not obvious for an electron . in the latter case",
    "the interplanar potential is strongly anharmonic @xcite . to calculate the dependence of dechanneling length on @xmath29 one can consider the following arguments . in the point of maximum curvature , the effective potential , acting on the electron ,",
    "can be written as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the distance from the plane .",
    "the depth of the effective potential well , @xmath87 , defines the maximum value of the transverse energy which an electron may gain . within the framework of the diffusion theory @xcite",
    "the dechanneling length @xmath54 of an ultra - relativistic projectile in a bent channel is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "hence one can write @xmath89 , where @xmath58 is defined by equation ( [ equation.5 ] ) and @xmath90 stands for the ratio @xmath91 . to obtain the explicit dependence",
    "@xmath90 one has to calculate the quantity @xmath88 using a realistic model for @xmath84 .",
    "versus @xmath29 for the pschl - teller potential ( solid curve ) and @xmath64 ( dashed curve ) . ]    in our estimates we used the pschl - teller potential @xcite .",
    "the results of calculation are presented in , where the solid curve stands for @xmath90 within the pschl - teller model .",
    "the dashed curve presents the dependence @xmath64 .",
    "it is seen that both curves are close for all @xmath29 . therefore , to estimate the dechanneling length of an ultra - relativistic electron in a periodically bent crystal one can use equation with @xmath58 from .",
    "consequently , the condition of a large number of periods within the dechanneling acquires the form @xmath92    in the next section we use equations , and to calculate the characteristics of an electron - based crystalline undulator .",
    "to prove the feasibility of an electron - based crystalline undulator for a fixed value of the undulator periods @xmath93 it is necessary to establish the ranges of @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 within which all the conditions , formulated in , are met .",
    "once the ranges are found one can calculate the spectral - angular distribution of the energy emitted in the undulator .",
    "the results , presented below in this section , show , that for an electron - based crystalline undulator the energy of emitted photons is in the range @xmath94 kev . for such energies the values of the attenuation length for all crystals fall within the @xmath95 range @xcite , resulting in a strong inequality @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , it is the dechanneling which becomes the dominant effect restricting the length of the undulator ( see the forth condition in ) .    to perform the numerical analysis let us express @xmath29 , @xmath2 and @xmath97 as functions of @xmath1 . from @xmath98 one finds the following expression for the dependence @xmath99 : @xmath100 because of the condition @xmath101 , the quantity @xmath102 defines the maximum value of the undulator period .",
    "substituting @xmath103 into ( [ equation.7 ] ) one derives the dependence @xmath104 : @xmath105 from and follows that by tuning @xmath1 and @xmath5 for fixed @xmath106 , one can establish the ranges of @xmath2 and @xmath29 where the first and second conditions in are met for a given crystal .    using the dependence",
    "@xmath104 it is possible to calculate the frequency of the fundamental harmonic as a function of @xmath1 : @xmath107 ( here @xmath108 is the undulator parameter ) .",

    "figures [ figure.4 ] and [ figure.5 ] present the results of numerical calculations of the dependences @xmath2 , @xmath29 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 on @xmath1 for @xmath115 gev electrons channeling in si(111 ) and c(111 ) . in figures [ figure.4](a ) and [ figure.5](a ) the ratio @xmath116 versus @xmath1 is shown for the fixed values of undulator periods within the dechanneling length .",
    "these graphs illustrate the ranges of @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath39 within which the second and third conditions from are met .",
    "the curves presented in the figures suggest that the condition @xmath19 is fulfilled for @xmath117 , i.e. the undulator with a sufficiently large number of periods can be considered .    , @xmath29 , @xmath118 and the peak intensity ( [ equation.9 ] ) on @xmath1 for a @xmath119 gev electron channeling in a periodically bent si(111 ) ( @xmath120  ) .",
    "in each graph the three curves correspond to different values of undulator periods within the dechanneling length : the solid curves stand for @xmath121 , the dashed curves - for @xmath122 , the chained curves - for @xmath123 . for each @xmath39",
    "the open circles indicate the parameters of undulator with @xmath124 ( see graph ( b ) ) .",

    "comparing figures [ figure.4](a ) and [ figure.5](a ) one notices that the curves for c(111 ) produce higher values of the ratio @xmath116 than those for si(111 ) calculated for the same number of periods .",
    "let us explain this difference .",
    "it follows from that the ratio @xmath116 as a function of @xmath1 attains maximum at @xmath125 .",
    "the maximum value of the ratio is given by @xmath126 for fixed values of @xmath44 and @xmath39 the magnitude of @xmath127 depends on the parameters of a channel , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and on the dechanneling length @xmath58 , equation [ equation.2 ] .",
    "taking into account that @xmath6 and @xmath7 equal to @xmath128  gev / cm and @xmath129   for c(111 ) and to @xmath130 gev / cm and @xmath131   for si(111 ) ( see @xcite ) , and @xmath132 cm for c and @xmath133 cm for si ( see figure [ figure.2 ] ) , one finds that the ratio @xmath127 for c(111 ) is approximately @xmath134 times higher than that for si(111 ) .",
    "one can easily demonstrate that the ratio @xmath135 is reached when @xmath124 .",
    "this is valid for all @xmath39 ( see figures [ figure.4 ] and [ figure.5 ] , where open circles mark the parameters corresponding to this value of @xmath29 ) . the graphs ( a ) and ( b ) in figures [ figure.4 ] and [ figure.5 ] allow one to explicitly establish the ranges of parameters within which the conditions are fulfilled , and consequently , the operation of an electron - based undulator is feasible .",
