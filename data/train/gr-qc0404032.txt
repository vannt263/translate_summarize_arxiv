    "phenomena in rotating coordinate systems have fascinated scientists since hundreds of years .",
    "three examples may serve as an illustration of this statement : _",
    "i ) _  the coriolis force is instrumental in the demonstration of the rotation of the earth with the help of the foucault pendulum @xcite . _",
    "ii ) _ the sagnac effect @xcite measured by the michelson - gale - interferometer @xcite is the analogous optical tool . _",
    "mach s principle @xcite ushers in a fresh view on the relativity of rotation . in the present paper",
    "we combine these three concepts and calculate the sagnac effect of gdel s universe .",
    "einstein s theory of general relativity @xcite predicts gravito - magnetic forces @xcite due to the rotation of massive objects .",
    "these forces give rise to the precession of nodal lines @xcite of two orbiting lageos - satellites proving the first measurement of the lense - thirring effect@xcite .",
    "the newly emerging field of atom optics has opened a new arena @xcite for measuring the dipole character of the lense - thirring field with the help of an atom gyroscope @xcite .",
    "rotation is not limited to a coordinate system or individual masses but even the universe can display features of rotation .",
    "indeed , in 1949 kurt gdel @xcite derived an exact solution of einstein s field equations , in which a homogeneous mass distribution rotates around every point in space .",
    "this solution shows rather unusual properties @xcite such as closed time like world - lines .    in a recent paper @xcite we have evaluated the sagnac effect of gdel s universe measured in a laboratory size interferometer .",
    "for this purpose we have used the linearized gdel metric , which can be approximated by the flat spacetime metric of a rotating coordinate system . in the present paper",
    "we calculate the exact sagnac effect for the gdel metric .",
    "gdel s universe has many fascinating features .",
    "indeed , the inherent rotation of this universe is only one interesting aspect . even more intriguing",
    "is the lack of a global time ordering and the existence of closed time like world lines giving rise to the possibility of time travel . such causal problems emerge also in other exact solutions of einstein s field equations , such as the kerr metric .",
    "however , gdel s metric has the advantage that it is of rather compact form and most calculations can be carried out analytically .",
    "it is commonly accepted that this model does not provide a matching description of our observed universe .",
    "nevertheless , there is the emerging field of experimental cosmology in the laboratory @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the examination of wave phenomena in curved spacetimes is a focus of research .",
    "for example , optical analogues of black holes have been proposed by studying light propagation in moving media @xcite or sound propagation in condensed matter systems @xcite . in this context , it is important to ask how far one can extent such analogues in general .",
    "gdel s universe can shed some light on this problem , since the existence of closed time like world lines curtails the expectation of a globally valid experimental analogue .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to see , where and how the experimental realization ceases to exist .    motivated by this idea",
    "we have initiated a study of wave propagation for the source free maxwell equations in gdel s metric @xcite . however ,",
    "in the present paper we will focus on the sagnac time delay within the limit of geometrical optics and draw the comparison to the sagnac time delay in a rotating frame in flat minkowski spacetime @xcite . in order to keep the paper self - contained and in view of the fact that this issue brings together researches from atomic , molecular and optical physics with experts in general relativity",
    "we have used this opportunity to combine our study of the sagnac effect with a mini review of gdel s universe .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we first briefly review the essential features of the sagnac effect and then derive an exact expression for the sagnac time delay for a time independent metric in cylindrical coordinates . we dedicate section [ sec2 ] to a discussion of the gdel metric .",
    "we then apply in section [ sagnactimedelay ] the expression of the sagnac time delay to gdel s metric . in section [ invform ]",
    "we reformulate the sagnac effect purely in terms of proper time delays of light pulses and compare it to the analogous expression for a rotating frame in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "we conclude by an outlook to possible laboratory realizations of the local light propagation in gdel s universe .",
    "in the present section we first recall the familiar sagnac effect and then derive an exact expression for the sagnac time delay in terms of metric coefficients .",
    "we conclude by making contact with the familiar sagnac effect using the metric of a rotating coordinate system in flat minkowski spacetime .      in 1913",
    "george sagnac performed an experiment @xcite , which he interpreted as an verification of the existence of the ether . in order to bring out the essential features of this phenomenon we consider two counter - propagating light pulses which travel on a circle of radius @xmath0 due to an appropriate array of mirrors or a glass fiber .",
    "when the setup is at rest the two counter - propagating pulses arrive at the same time at the point of emission . however , when the arrangement rotates there is a time delay between them .",
    "this sagnac time delay @xmath1 follows from an elementary , classical argument @xcite and reads @xmath2 hence , @xmath1 is proportional to the area @xmath3 enclosed by the light beams and the rotation rate @xmath4 of the ring with respect to the flat minkowski spacetime . moreover , we note that this result is an approximation and higher order corrections in @xmath4 will arise as discussed in section [ timerotframe ] .",
    "the sagnac effect is the basis of modern navigational systems .",
    "moreover , it can also be generalized in the framework of general relativity @xcite , as presented in the next section .",
    "in particular , the sagnac effect is closely related to to the hannay angle @xcite and the synchronization of clocks @xcite along a closed path .",
    "we now derive an exact expression for the sagnac time delay @xmath5 in terms of the time independent metric coefficients @xmath6 expressed in cylindrical coordinates @xmath7 . for a general treatment of the sagnac effect of two counterpropagating light rays along any spatially closed path in an arbitrary metric",
    "we refer to @xcite . however , inhere we choose a particularly simple configuration and consider the propagation along a circle of radius @xmath0 in the @xmath8 plane resulting in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for this situation the line element reads @xmath11 and vanishes for light @xmath12 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath13 of the light beam follows from the quadratic equation @xmath14 giving rise to the two velocities @xmath15 in order to get two solutions , which correspond to two ordinary counter - propagating light beams , we restrict ourselves to spacetime regions @xmath16 , in which the above metric coefficients satisfy the conditions @xmath17 these conditions immediately imply that the angular velocity @xmath18 is positive and @xmath19 is negative for all events in @xmath16 , so that the monotony of the corresponding solutions @xmath20 is guaranteed .",
    "the condition @xmath21 is furthermore important to allow for an observer resting relative to the chosen spatial coordinates and measuring the proper time , as discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we can find the coordinate times @xmath22 of the first return of the counter - propagating light rays to their starting point @xmath23 by integrating equation ( [ angvel ] ) over one period @xmath24 in positive and negative angular direction , respectively .",
    "hence , we arrive at @xmath25 where in the second step we have made use of the periodicity of the metric coefficients in the coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "when we recall the connection @xmath27 between the coordinate time @xmath28 and the proper time @xmath29 measured by an observer resting at @xmath30 , the corresponding proper times @xmath31 of the incoming light rays read @xmath32    the positive sign in @xmath33 corresponds to the light pulse propagating in the positive angular direction , whereas the negative sign in @xmath34 denotes the proper time of the light pulse traveling in the negative angular direction .",
    "the sagnac proper time delay @xmath5 follows as @xmath35 which reduces with help of the explicit expressions ( [ expressions ] ) for @xmath36 to @xmath37 if we further assume , that the metric coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 do not depend on the angular coordinate @xmath26 , then the expression ( [ sagtimeint ] ) for the sagnac time delay reduces to the compact formula @xmath40 for negative values of @xmath5 the light pulse which propagates in the positive angular direction returns before the other pulse and vice versa for positive @xmath5 .",
    "we conclude by noting that the sagnac time delay ( [ sagtime ] ) is by construction only form - invariant under the special class of coordinate transformations @xmath41 which change neither the frame of reference nor the angular coordinate .",
    "we now want to apply formula ( [ sagtime ] ) of the sagnac time delay to the metric of a rotating coordinate frame in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "the line element in flat minkowski spacetime reads in cylindrical coordinates @xmath42 @xmath43 the coordinates @xmath44 of a reference frame rotating with a rate @xmath45 are defined by the transformation equations @xmath46 and give rise to a line element @xmath47 of the form @xmath48 to satisfy the conditions ( [ conditions ] ) we have to restrict ourselves to the spacetime region @xmath49 when we now assume that the counter - propagating light rays travel along a circle with radius @xmath50 and substitute the metric coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 into ( [ sagtime ] ) , the sagnac time delay in the rotating frame reads @xmath53 in the first approximation of @xmath54 this expression reduces to the time delay of the familiar sagnac effect ( [ famsagnac ] ) .",
    "however , also the limit of large rotation rates , where the square root in the denominator gets important is of interest .",
    "indeed , in section [ invform ] we present an expression for the sagnac time delay in gdel s universe , which on first sight looks very different from ( [ minsagtime ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , a closer view reveals that this formula is numerically very close to the minkowskian sagnac time delay .",
    "in order to gain some insight into the intricacies of gdel s universe we briefly review two representations of gdel s metric that are convenient for our analysis of the sagnac effect . moreover ,",
    "we sketch the conditions under which this metric solves einstein s field equations . we then present tensorial quantities characterizing the time like velocity field of the matter generating the gdel metric .",
    "furthermore , we make contact with the metric of flat spacetime in cylindrical coordinates and mention the symmetries and the causal structure of gdel s metric .",
    "we conclude this section by summarizing special null geodesics , which will be important in expressing the sagnac time delay by measurable quantities .",
    "the line element @xmath55 given by gdel @xcite in 1949 in dimensionless , cylindrical coordinates @xmath56 with @xmath57 has the form @xmath58 the parameter @xmath59 has the unit of a length .    in the next section",
    "we derive a simple expression for the sagnac effect . for this purpose , it is convenient to use a slightly different form of gdel s metric , which can be obtained from ( [ urmetric ] ) by the coordinate transformation @xmath60 the resulting line element reads @xmath61 these new coordinates have now physical dimensions .",
    "we can convince ourselves that the metric coefficients @xmath62 corresponding to the line element ( [ metric ] ) indeed solve einstein s field equations @xmath63 by calculating explicitly the ricci tensor @xmath64 and the scalar curvature @xmath65 , defined in appendix [ convention ] . here",

    "@xmath83 here we have introduced the projection tensor @xmath84 together with @xmath85 , where the semicolon denotes the covariant derivative .    however , we arrive at a non - vanishing rotation tensor @xmath86}=u_{[\\alpha,\\beta ] } = r\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}a}\\left(\\delta^2_\\alpha\\delta^1_\\beta-\\delta^2_\\beta\\delta^1_\\alpha\\right ) .",

    "moreover , for @xmath91 we find that the line element ( [ metric ] ) can be approximated in first order by @xmath92 while the zeroth order approximation @xcite corresponds to the line element ( [ lineelflat ] ) of flat spacetime in cylindrical coordinates the linear correction is reminiscent of the line element ( [ lineelrot ] ) of a rotating coordinate frame in minkowski spacetime .",
    "if a spacetime manifold with the metric @xmath6 possesses symmetries , then they can be characterized by a special class of coordinate transformations @xmath93 which satisfy the condition @xmath94 such a coordinate transformation is called isometry . in particular , the infinitesimal isometries @xmath95 with @xmath96 are of special interest , since every continuous isometry can be constructed successively by these infinitesimal isometries .    the infinitesimal transformation ( [ infiso ] ) together with ( [ iso ] ) and the transformation law of a metric yields the condition @xmath97 for the killing vector field @xmath98 .",
    "the solutions @xmath99 of this linear system of partial differential equations characterize the symmetry of a given metric .    in the case of gdel s metric",
    "we find five killing vectors as solutions of the killing equation ( [ killinggl ] ) .",
    "three of them are immediately found from ( [ iso ] ) , since gdel s metric does not depend explicitly on the coordinates @xmath100 . with the constants",
    "@xmath101 the complete solution of ( [ killinggl ] ) reads @xmath102 with @xmath103 since ( [ killigoe ] ) contains a time like killing vector gdel s universe is stationary .",
    "moreover it is also spatially homogeneous .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis of the killing vectors shows , that gdel s metric is not static and also not isotropic .",
    "the latter feature is due to the existence of a rotational axis giving rise to a rotational symmetry in the @xmath104 planes .",
    "the non - vanishing rotation scalar has a dramatic consequence for the causal structure of gdel s universe . in order to gain some insight into this feature , it is useful to consider infinitesimal light cones at different spatial points .",
    "figure  [ lichtkegel ] depicts such an arrangement .",

    "the middle circle of critical radius @xmath108 separates the domains of different causal behavior . at every point of the inner domain",
    "the light cones lie outside of the @xmath109 plane as exemplified by the cones along the inner circle .",
    "in contrast , outside of the critical circle the cones cut through this plane.,width=510 ]    for every instant of time there exists a domain in space with closed time like world - lines . to visualize this property",
    ", we consider the orientation of some selected light cones with respect to the plane of constant coordinate time @xmath110 .    at the origin of the coordinate system",
    "the axis of the light cone is orthogonal to the plane .",
    "as we move away from the origin the light cones start to tilt , as indicated in figure  [ lichtkegel ] . at the critical gdel radius @xmath108 , represented by the middle circle , the light cones are tangential to the plane of constant coordinate time @xmath110 .",
    "this circle of radius @xmath111 is a light like curve . outside this critical radius",
    "the inclination of the light cones increases further and allows the existence of closed time like curves , as shown by the outer circle in figure  [ lichtkegel ] .",
    "it is this peculiar feature of the causal structure which permits to connect two arbitrary events of spacetime by a time like curve , irrespectively of their ordering in the chosen coordinate time @xmath110 .",
    "indeed , we can start from a point within the inner circle and cross the critical gdel radius to explore the world beyond this border . during this trespassing",
    "we take a time like world line which spirals downwards into the past .",
    "having regressed long enough on this trajectory we can finally return to the original causal domain , thus arriving before departing .",
    "we conclude by noting that closed time like world - lines are not limited to gdel s universe .",
    "they also appear in other exact solutions of einstein s field equations for rotating mass distributions .",

    "we also analyze the sagnac effect observed by a detector rotating relative to the ideal fluid .",
    "finally we briefly discuss the dependence of the sagnac time delay on the choice of the spatial coordinates .",
    "we start by considering a situation in which the emitter and the detector are at rest in the coordinate frame of the ideal fluid .",
    "the light pulses propagate along a circle of radius @xmath139 in the plane @xmath8 . recalling gdel s metric ( [ metriccoeff ] ) and the rotation scalar ( [ rotskalar ] ) the relevant metric coefficients read @xmath140 in order to satisfy the conditions ( [ conditions ] )",
    ", we have to restrict ourselves to the spacetime region @xmath141 if we do not confine ourselves to this domain the coordinate time needed by one of the light pulses to return to the starting point will be negative for radii larger than the critical gdel radius @xmath108 .",
    "this feature follows from the orientation of the future light cones in figure [ lichtkegel ] .",
    "furthermore an observer resting with the detector at @xmath142 would measure a negative proper time of the returning light ray , which travels backward in the coordinate time . by restricting our experimental setup to the region",
    "@xmath16 we avoid such alien situations in which the light pulse returns before it is emitted with respect to the chosen coordinate time .",
    "when we substitute the coefficients ( [ koeffi ] ) into formula ( [ sagtime ] ) the sagnac time delay for gdel s metric reads @xmath143    since this expression is negative , we conclude from the definition of the proper time @xmath5 , that the light pulse propagating in the positive angular direction will always return to its starting point before the pulse propagating in the negative direction .",
    "it is instructive to compare this result to the familiar sagnac time delay @xmath1 given by ( [ famsagnac ] ) . on first sight the absolute value of the sagnac time delay ( [ sagnactime ] ) in gdel s universe seems to be identical to the familiar sagnac effect ( [ famsagnac ] ) .",
    "however , when we recall that the coordinate @xmath0 in gdel s universe does not represent a proper distance , we recognize that the similarity only arises from the special choice of our spatial coordinates .",
    "we will return to this point in section [ spatialcoorddep ] .",
    "we conclude by noting that the gravitational time delay in gdel s universe has also been calculated in @xcite . however , the expression given in that paper is quadratic in the rotation scalar .",
    "we now analyze the sagnac time delay for a slightly different experimental situation . the light source emitting",
    "the two counter - propagating light rays and the detector are now no longer at rest relative to the ideal fluid , but rotate relative to it .",
    "we denote the corresponding rotation rate by @xmath144 . due to this additional rotation the sagnac time delay",
    "will also depend on @xmath144 . after providing an explicit expression for the sagnac time delay for this situation",
    "we choose @xmath144 such , that this time delay vanishes exactly .",
    "we start from the metric ( [ metriccoeff ] ) and perform the coordinate transformation @xmath145 into the rotating frame of the detector . in the new coordinates the line element takes the form @xmath146 the conditions ( [ conditions ] ) for the corresponding metric coefficients in the rotating frame lead to the restrictions @xmath147 and @xmath148 on the radial coordinate @xmath149 and the rotation rate @xmath144 . indeed",
    ", these conditions lead to a nontrivial region @xmath16 of allowed radii @xmath149 with respect to the chosen @xmath144 .",
    "we again denote the radius of the circular light path by @xmath50 .",
    "when we insert the relevant coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 into formula ( [ sagtime ] ) and take into account the rotation scalar ( [ rotskalar ] ) we find the sagnac time delay @xmath150    the special choice @xmath151 of the rotation rate of the detector leads to a vanishing time delay @xmath152 between the two counter - propagating light pulses .",
    "hence , for infinitesimal radii @xmath50 , the rotation velocity @xmath144 of the detector is equal to the rotation scalar @xmath153 of gdel s universe .",
    "we now return to the sagnac time delay measured in the rest - frame of the ideal fluid of section [ sagtimerestframe ] . according to equation ( [ sagnactime ] )",
    "the sagnac time delay @xmath5 depends in a linear way on the rotation scalar @xmath153 of gdel s universe .",
    "we emphasize that this linearity is only due to the special choice of our space coordinates ( [ coord ] ) in the line element ( [ metric ] ) . indeed",
    ", we can also express the sagnac time delay @xmath5 in the dimensionless space coordinates of the original gdel line element ( [ urmetric ] ) , where the coordinate transformation ( [ coord ] ) does not change the frame of reference . in these coordinates ( [ altcoord ] )",
    "the sagnac time delay reads @xmath154 although in this representation the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath153 differs from that of equation ( [ sagnactime ] ) both formulae contain the same physics .",
    "this invariance is hidden behind the explicit dependence of @xmath5 in ( [ sagnactime ] ) and ( [ sagtimenewcoord ] ) on the spatial coordinates , which have no immediate physical meaning . in the next section",
    "we are going to rectify this problem by introducing an invariant formulation via an operational definition of the radial coordinate .",
    "the different formulae ( [ sagnactime ] ) and ( [ sagtimenewcoord ] ) for the sagnac time delay bring out most clearly the question : how can we reformulate the radial coordinate of the mirrors in a measurable quantity ?    in the present section we outline a measurement strategy to address this question and then reformulate the sagnac time delay solely in terms of proper times of light signals .",
    "the obtained relation allows for an interesting comparison to expression ( [ minsagtime ] ) for the sagnac time delay in a rotating frame of reference .",
    "all expressions for the sagnac time delay derived so far contain a radial coordinate .",
    "what is a measurement strategy for obtaining the radius @xmath0 of the circular path of the light pulses ?",
    "we answer this question in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "we send light signals along their null geodesics from the center of the circle to every mirror @xmath155 in the @xmath156 plane , as illustrated on the left side of figure [ lichtbahnen ] .     of a circle ( left ) and of the sagnac time delay @xmath5 ( right ) .",
    "light rays start at the origin and propagate on null geodesics to the mirrors ( m ) , where they are reflected back to the origin ( left ) .",
    "the proper time @xmath157 between emission and arrival of the light pulses is measured by an observer resting at the origin .",
    "the figure on the right illustrates the typical experimental arrangement for the sagnac effect with a detector ( d ) on the circle .",
    "the straight lines between two consecutive mirrors are an approximation to the corresponding null geodesics .",
    "however , the curves shown on the left are exact null geodesics ( see appendix [ intnullgeo]).,width=434 ]    the mirrors are arranged in such a way as to reflect the light back to the point of emission . moreover they are lined up in the @xmath156 plane as to ensure that the pulses emitted simultaneously at the center and reflected from the mirrors all return to the center at the same time .",
    "hence , the radius @xmath0 can be expressed by the proper time @xmath157 between the emission and detection of the reflected pulses measured by an observer resting at the origin @xmath127 .",
    "once the circular setup of mirrors has been established by this operational procedure the mirrors have to be readjusted to guide the counter - propagating light rays in this circular sagnac configuration with radius @xmath0 , as indicated in the right of figure [ lichtbahnen ] .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing that our experimental implementation is only the simplest conceivable model .",
    "it is a gedanken experiment , which even requires an infinite amount of mirrors .",
    "however , a practical realization has many caveats which need to be considered , such as the finite number of mirrors , the propagation of the light pulses on null geodesics in - between and the applicability of geometrical optics .",
    "in fact , the case of a finite number of mirrors has been carried out in principle by @xcite , where the sagnac time delay in a rotating frame in minkowski spacetime serves as an example of the given method .",
    "we are now in a position to establish a connection between the sagnac time delay @xmath5 and the rotation scalar @xmath153 in terms of the proper time interval @xmath157 , measured by an observer resting at the origin @xmath127 of the coordinate system .",
    "we start by calculating the coordinate time for the light pulses to propagate to the mirrors and back . for this purpose",
    "we recall ( [ radius ] )  ( [ time ] ) .",
    "we then translate this time interval into proper time and express the radius @xmath0 by the sagnac time delay making use of equation ( [ sagnactime ] ) .",

    "correspond to @xmath0 and we choose the first solution @xmath159 within the interval @xmath161 .",
    "the coordinate time between the emission of a light pulse at @xmath127 and the reflection of it from @xmath139 follows from ( [ time ] ) and ( [ mlambda ] ) and reads @xmath162 since gdel s metric is stationary , spatially homogeneous and possesses rotational symmetry in the planes @xmath163 , it takes twice the time @xmath164 to travel to and from the mirrors . for an observer resting at the origin @xmath127 the proper time @xmath157 between emission and arrival of the light pulses",
    "is given by @xmath165 , and consequently @xmath166 when we use equation ( [ radius ] ) for @xmath159 in ( [ rechnung2 ] ) we arrive at the expression @xmath167 for the proper time @xmath157 . here",
    "we have recalled the definition ( [ etaform ] ) .    in order to make the connection to the absolute value of the sagnac time delay @xmath5",
    ", we recall from ( [ sagnactime ] ) the relation @xmath168 keeping in mind , that the negative value of @xmath5 is only due to a faster propagation of the light pulse in the positive angular direction .",
    "this formula allows us to express the radius @xmath0 in ( [ beoeigenzeit ] ) in terms of the absolute value @xmath169 of the sagnac time delay . in order to avoid the appearance of the square root of @xmath5",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless parameters @xmath170 with @xmath171 and @xmath172 when we replace the proper time @xmath157 and the radius @xmath0 in ( [ beoeigenzeit ] ) by their corresponding dimensionless parameters ( [ parameters ] ) and ( [ parameterm ] ) we arrive at the transcendental equation @xmath173 this relation is quite a remarkable result since it provides an invariant formulation of the sagnac time delay in gdel s universe .",
    "indeed , for a given value of the @xmath174 , that is for the radius of the circular path measured in propagation time @xmath157 of light , the solution of this equation is the scaled sagnac time delay @xmath175 .",
    "since we have scaled all proper times in terms of the rotation scalar the transcendental equation contains no parameters of gdel s universe .",
    "the information about the metric reflects itself solely in the form of the equation .",
    "we now compare the transcendental equation ( [ connectexact ] ) for the sagnac time delay of gdel s metric with the corresponding formula for the time delay ( [ minsagtime ] ) found in a rotating frame of reference in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the first step consists of replacing the radial coordinate in equation ( [ minsagtime ] ) by a measurable time . for this purpose",
    "we apply the same measurement strategy to the rotating frame as discussed in [ replacesag ] .",
    "we then substitute the radial coordinate @xmath50 by the proper time interval @xmath176 of a light ray , which returns after reflection from the circular mirror arrangement at @xmath50 to the origin . since the observer at the origin is at rest relative to the inertial frame of minkowski spacetime",
    ", we find immediately the proper time @xmath177 for the comparison of the sagnac time delay ( [ minsagtime ] ) with the expression ( [ connectexact ] ) it is useful to introduce the dimensionless parameters @xmath178 and @xmath179 in complete analogy to the formulae ( [ parameters ] ) and ( [ parameterm ] ) .    using these parameters",
    "we can cast the sagnac time delay ( [ minsagtime ] ) into the form @xmath180 which in contrast to ( [ connectexact ] ) is an explicit formula for @xmath181 in terms of @xmath182 .    in order to obtain a formula analogous to ( [ connectexact ] )",
    "we solve this equation for @xmath183 , which yields @xmath184 due to our restriction ( [ rotsptimereg ] ) to the spacetime region @xmath185 the parameter @xmath182 has to satisfy the condition @xmath186    figure [ invsagnac ] illustrates the differences in the curves defined by ( [ connectexact ] ) and ( [ connectrot ] ) .",
    "we find that for our measurement strategy the difference between the solid and dotted curve is very small .",
    "this is surprising , as the underlying physical systems with gdel s universe on the one hand and the rotating frame in flat minkowski spacetime on the other hand , differ substantially in their global behavior .",
    "and @xmath183 of a light signal propagating from the origin to a mirror on the circle and back in gdel s universe and in a rotating frame of reference in flat spacetime , plotted versus the sagnac time delays @xmath175 and @xmath181 in scaled units .",
    "while the left ordinate applies to the absolute values of those scaled time delays , the dashed - dotted line magnifies the residual differences @xmath187 as indicated by the right ordinate.,width=328 ]    this similarity can also be understood from the taylor series expansion of ( [ connectexact ] ) and ( [ connectrot ] ) .",
    "indeed , for small values of @xmath175 or @xmath181 we find @xmath188 and @xmath189    thus the two equations determining the sagnac time delay only differ in the contribution of the fifth power of @xmath175 or @xmath181 .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the sagac time delay in gdel s universe .",
    "our analysis generalizes the results of our previous examination @xcite , which were limited to small radial dimensions and rotation rates , to arbitrary sizes of the circular sagnac interferometer and arbitrary rotation rates of gdel s universe .",
    "the previous results exhibited a close relation between the sagnac effect in gdel s universe and in a rotating frame in flat spacetime . by obtaining exact and invariant expressions for the sagnac time delays in both systems , valid for arbitrary rotation rates and radii within @xmath16 and @xmath185 , we have demonstrated inhere , that this statement is also valid in general .",
    "the original gdel solution is not in agreement with cosmological observations of the background radiation @xcite .",
    "therefore , one might be tempted to dismiss this remarkable exact solution of einstein s field equations altogether .",
    "however , recently analogies between light propagation in curved spacetimes and optics in moving media @xcite or sonic propagation in condensed matter systems @xcite have instigated renewed interest in this subject . for example , these articles consider experimental analogues of a gravitational black hole . here , the event horizon emerges when the flow velocities of the optical medium or the condensate exceed the velocities of light or sound in these media , respectively .",
    "how far can we push these analogies ?",
    "can we find an optical or sonic realization of the light propagation in gdel s universe ?",
    "unfortunately , a global simulation of the gdel spacetime via an experimental analogue seems not to be very probable due to the causal structure of this metric discussed in section [ causstruct ] .",
    "but since we can approximate the local light propagation in gdel s universe by a rotating coordinate frame in minkowski spacetime it should be possible to translate the physics of wave propagation in curved space locally to cold quantum gases .",
    "vortices @xcite or alternatively abrikosov lattices @xcite might offer a possible route to an analogue of gdel s universe in the laboratory .",
    "we thank i. ciufolini , j. ehlers , g. schfer and g. sssmann and a. wolf for many fruitful discussions .",
    "moreover , we have thoroughly enjoyed the stimulating atmosphere at the hyper meeting in paris and appreciated the financial support , which made our participation possible .",
    "we are also very grateful to c. lmmerzahl for his editorial efforts .",
    "throughout this article we use the signature @xmath190 of our metric @xmath6 with the determinant @xmath191 and denote the covariant derivative with a semicolon and the ordinary partial derivative with a comma .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor @xmath192 is defined in terms of the levi - cevita - symbol @xmath193 the components of the riemann tensor @xmath194 result from the christoffel symbols @xmath195 the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature @xmath196 follow by contraction .",
    "the covariant derivative of a contravariant vector field @xmath197 reads @xmath198 whereas for a covariant vector field it takes the form @xmath199",
    "in this appendix we outline a procedure to obtain the solutions of the geodesic equations in gdel s metric . since the main goal of the paper is the sagnac time delay and in particular , an invariant formulation of it , we confine ourselves to special initial conditions appropriate for our experimental setup .      the central idea for solving the geodesic equations",
    "relies on finding simple expressions for the constants of motion . some of these constants can easily be obtained if the metric possesses killing vectors @xmath200 .",
    "this feature can be understood by contracting the geodesic equations ( [ geodesic ] ) with the contravariant components of a killing vector , that is @xmath201 when we recall the killing equation ( [ killinggl ] ) and note , that the covariant derivative of a scalar is just the ordinary partial derivative , we find @xmath202 hence , every killing vector corresponds to a constant of motion .",
    "since the metric coefficients ( [ metriccoeff ] ) depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath205 , the solution of the geodesic equations ( [ geodesic ] ) can be found by making use of the first three killing vectors in ( [ killigoe ] ) to obtain the simple constants of motion @xmath206 here @xmath159 denotes the initial curve parameter and in the second step of these equations we have made use of the relation @xmath207 with the metric coefficients ( [ metriccoeff ] ) .",
    "we substitute the expressions ( [ const1])-([const3 ] ) for the covariant components of the four  velocity @xmath208 into the constant of motion ( [ norm ] ) and find with the contravariant metric coefficients @xmath209 the equation @xmath210    inserting @xmath211 into this expression yields a differential equation in the radial coordinate @xmath205 .",
    "the solution @xmath212 can then be used to formulate the differential equations for the coordinates @xmath110 and @xmath213 by making use of the relations @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the solution of the third spatial coordinate @xmath107 can be obtained from the last constant of motion ( [ const3 ] ) @xmath216 thus , the motion in @xmath107direction is like a free motion in one dimension in flat minkowski spacetime .      in the remainder of this appendix we focus on the solution of the geodesic equations for light , that is @xmath119 in ( [ norm ] ) , subjected to the special initial conditions associated with the experimental arrangement considered in section [ invform ] . in particular ,",
    "the light pulse starts with the initial curve parameter @xmath120 at the position @xmath121 and propagates in the @xmath156 plane .",
    "therefore , we have to choose @xmath122 .",
    "we emphasize , that for @xmath127 the angle velocity @xmath217 looses its meaning .",
    "moreover , since we start at the origin and @xmath205 is positive , we have to take @xmath123 .",
    "these special initial conditions reduce the constants of motion ( [ const1])([const3 ] ) to @xmath218 these compact expressions allow us to integrate the differential equation ( [ radeqn ] ) for our radial coordinate @xmath212 as shown in the next section .",
    "the constants of motion ( [ cons1])([cons3 ] ) reduce the differential equation ( [ radeqn ] ) to @xmath219 which leads with @xmath220 and @xmath123 to @xmath221 the two equations correspond to the two different signs of the radial velocity .",
    "separation of variables @xmath222 finally yields the radial geodesic @xmath223 here we have introduced the periodicity rate @xmath224 in such a way , that one cycle of the radial coordinate @xmath212 corresponds to the curve parameter @xmath225 .",
    "it is apparent , that the solution ( [ radius2 ] ) is not differentiable at @xmath127 .",
    "this feature is due to the transformation to polar coordinates , which is singular at @xmath127 .",
    "furthermore we recognize that these null geodesics touch the critical gdel radius @xmath108 for @xmath226 .",
    "the explicit expression ( [ radius2 ] ) for our radial coordinate allows us now to find the corresponding expressions for both the coordinate time @xmath131 and the angular coordinate @xmath133 . for this purpose",
    "we use the relation @xmath227 with the contravariant metric coefficients ( [ contrametriccoeff ] ) and the constants of motion ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) and arrive at @xmath228 hence , the coordinate time is increasing monotonously .",
    "substitution of ( [ radius2 ] ) into the above equation leads to @xmath229 which after integration yields @xmath230 here we have used ( [ perrate ] ) and introduced the integer @xmath129_i \\label{gausschekl}\\ ] ] where the brackets denote the greatest integer less than or equal to the number inside them .",
    "the integer @xmath231 guarantees the continuity , differentiability and monotony of @xmath131 for arbitrary @xmath232 .      the dependence of the angular coordinate @xmath133 on the curve parameter can be found in a way similar to the one of the coordinate time @xmath131 . with the help of the relation @xmath233 and the constants of motion ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) we arrive at @xmath234 since the angular velocity @xmath235 looses its meaning at the point @xmath127 we perform the integration over one cycle only , that is @xmath236 . in this case",
    "the integral @xmath237 leads in analogy to ( [ rechnung1 ] ) under the restriction @xmath238 to the angular coordinate @xmath239 we can rewrite this expression in order to allow arbitrary values of @xmath240 which results in @xmath241 equations ( [ radius2 ] ) , ( [ time2 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) represent the null geodesics for our special initial conditions .",
