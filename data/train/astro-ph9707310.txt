    "the macho and eros projects have detected microlensing towards the large magellanic cloud lmc ( alcock et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 , aubourg et al . 1995 ) , and interpreted these events as due to lenses located in the milky way halo .",
    "there have been , however , other interpretations of the lmc microlensing events .    sahu ( 1995 ) argued that the lenses may be located in the disk of the lmc itself .",
    "this is unlikely because the spatial distribution of the events is not clustered towards the lmc bar , and because this model predicts only 1 event in the 2-yr data of alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , while 6 - 8 bonafide events are observed .",
    "we note , however , that the binary event lmc-9 appears likely to be located in the lmc , if the lmc velocity dispersion ( and microlensing optical depth ) is small ( bennett et al . 1996 ) .",
    "gould et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argue that one of the macho events ( lmc-5 ) could be due to an m star lens located in the milky way disk .",
    "this is possible , as alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimate that about one event out of the eight detected should be due to a thin- or thick - disk lens .",
    "zhao ( 1996 ) has suggested that the lmc microlensing could be due to an intervening dwarf galaxy like the sgr dwarf ( ibata et al .",
    "the suggestion is supported by an apparent peak in the rr lyrae distribution of payne - gaposchkin ( 1971 ) at 16 to 25 kpc . however , connolly ( 1985 ) suggest that these faint rr lyrae may be associated with the lmc , and thus may not be rr lyrae at all .",
    "these stars would have periods similar to rr lyrae , but absolute magnitudes that are about 2 magnitudes brighter , if they belong to the lmc .",
    "this issue can be readily explored using the macho photometric database and other recent observations reported in the literature . in this letter",
    "we examine in detail the rr lyrae distance distribution , concluding that there is no evidence of the existence of such a galaxy .",
    "more recently , zhao ( 1997 ) proposed that a significant fraction of the microlensing events may be caused by lenses within an extended tidal tail in front of the lmc .",
    "this very interesting suggestion may be addressed in the future when variable stars and microlensing towards new lines of sight , such as the small magellanic cloud , are explored .",
    "we will look for evidence of an intervening galaxy in between us and the lmc in the macho photometric database .",
    "dwarf galaxies of the local group have experienced complex star formation histories , containing at present old and intermediate age stellar populations ( see reviews by hodge 1994 and mateo 1996 ) .",
    "thus , we will search for these populations using known tracers : rr lyrae , cepheid and clump giant stars .",
    "these tracers are good distance indicators , and they would be brighter if they belong to an intervening galaxy located in front of the lmc .",
    "zhao ( 1996 ) uses the specific example of a galaxy like the sgr dwarf discovered by ibata et al .",
    "this hypothetical sgr - like dwarf galaxy would be located between the outskirts of the galactic disk , and the lmc , with distance modulus constrained to the range @xmath0 mag .",
    "we also assume that the line of sight depth of this galaxy is small , @xmath1 kpc ( i.e. comparable to the observed depth of the sgr dwarf , alcock et al . 1997 ) , a priori discarding a  finger of god \" effect .",
    "the rr lyrae stars are easily detected tracers of an intervening galaxy , because they are easily identified from their light curves , and they are excellent distance indicators .",
    "rr lyrae belonging to a dwarf galaxy that is not extended along the line of sight will show as a peak in the luminosity function , while rr lyrae belonging to the milky way halo would be more or less uniformly distributed between the sun and the lmc .",
    "for example , the sgr galaxy shows up clearly as an extra peak in the rr lyrae luminosity function of bulge fields ( alard 1996 , mateo et al .",
    "1996 , alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) .    upon inspection of the data presented by payne - gaposchkin ( 1971 ) , zhao ( 1996 )",
    "suggests that there are a number of rr lyrae clustered at 16 to 25 kpc , arguing that they trace an over - dense region , with significant consequences for the interpretation of microlensing towards the lmc .",
    "the spectroscopic followup of 8 of these stars by connolly ( 1985 ) and smith ( 1985 ) confirmed that 3 of them are not rr lyrae , and that 5 of them are galactic halo rr lyrae stars , not members of the lmc .",
    "the radial velocities also prove that these 5 stars are not related to each other : @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ( for comparison , @xmath4 km s@xmath3 , ibata et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we have studied the line - of - sight distribution of the rr lyrae stars in front of the lmc using the year - one macho photometry database , which contains @xmath5 variable stars in the lmc bar region . the period - amplitude diagram for @xmath6 short - period lmc variable stars",
    "is presented in figure 1 , showing the cuts applied to select candidate rr lyrae types ab and c.    figure 2 shows the color - magnitude diagram of rr lyrae star candidates from the cuts applied in the period - amplitude plane of figure 1 .",
    "magnitudes are approximate kron - cousins @xmath7 and @xmath8 , adopting a global calibration solution and neglecting small field to field zero point differences .",
    "the left panel shows the vast majority of lmc rrab ( @xmath9 ) centered at about @xmath10 , @xmath11 . in order to select foreground rr lyrae stars",
    "we will consider only stars with @xmath12 .",
    "there is a large group of stars ( @xmath13 ) centered at @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "these are lmc rrab blended with clump giant stars , according to their brighter magnitudes , redder colors and smaller amplitudes .",
    "there is an extended group of blue stars ( @xmath16 ) with @xmath17 , which include some rrab blended with main - sequence stars and many eclipsing binaries .",
    "finally , there is a group of stars centered at about @xmath18 , @xmath11 , which are mostly short - period type i cepheids in the lmc ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 , in preparation ) .",
    "they are a major contaminating source when selecting foreground rrab stars , because they have similar periods , amplitudes and colors to those stars .",
    "foreground rr lyrae and type i cepheids were distinguished using the shape of their lightcurves .",
    "we also checked the location of these stars in the period - magnitude diagram and compared them with the macho type i cepheid sample .",
    "the short period cepheids clearly lie along the 1h ( overtone ) sequence .",
    "some of these cepheids turned out to be newly discovered 1h/2h beat cepheids , identified via excess photometric scatter at maximum brightness and confirmed by discrete fourier transforms ( alcock et al .",
    "the right panel of figure 2 shows the rr lyrae type c stars ( @xmath19 ) , with about @xmath13 eclipsing binaries and rrc stars blended with clump giants and main sequence stars .",
    "we find 16 foreground rrab stars with amplitudes @xmath20 , periods @xmath21 days , colors @xmath22 , and magnitudes @xmath12 , and 4 foreground rrc stars with @xmath20 , @xmath23 days , @xmath24 , and @xmath12 .",
    "these cuts are optimized to discriminate foreground rr lyrae from lmc rr lyrae , blends and other variable stars .",
    "the stars were additionally identified in the four - year macho database .",
    "calibrated lightcurves confirm their identification as rr lyrae and do not change the distance distribution .",
    "the coordinates , magnitudes , colors and periods of the present sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "we measure distances to the foreground rr lyrae stars adopting @xmath25 ( reid 1997 , gratton et al .",
    "1997 ) . the uncertainty in these individual distances is estimated to be about 10% , with the caveat that the zero point in rr lyrae absolute magnitudes may be more uncertain ( e.g. @xmath26 gould 1995 ) , which does not have any effect in the results of this paper .",
    "the distance distribution of the 20 foreground rr lyrae stars in the direction of the lmc is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the lines illustrate a @xmath27 density halo with spherical flattened ( b / a=0.6 ) distributions .",
    "the flattened halo is normalized arbitrarily to give the same total number of stars out to 40 kpc .",
    "note that there is no significant concentration at any distance .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of these rr lyrae stars in the sky is uniform across the lmc , not concentrated or clumped .",
    "the observation of rr lyrae stars in the sgr dwarf by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) allows us to give a direct comparison with what would be expected if there were a dwarf galaxy in the foreground .",
    "we place this set of rrab stars ( @xmath28 ) in the direction of the lmc , given that the total areas surveyed towards the lmc and bulge are similar ( neglecting incompleteness corrections , which would be worse in the bulge fields , and neglecting rrc stars in sgr , which would increase this sample to @xmath29 , but which are incomplete ) .",
    "the distance distribution of the sgr rrab , equivalent to about @xmath30% of all the macho rrab found in the lmc , is overplotted in figure 3 ( we have actually used the reddening independent magnitudes to compute their individual distances due to the heavy differential reddening of the bulge fields ) .",
    "this magnitude distribution is very different from that of the observed foreground rr lyrae stars , arguing against the existence of a sgr - like galaxy in front of the lmc .",
    "more stringent limits are possible once radial velocities can be obtained for the stars in our sample .      rr lyrae trace old and metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "classical cepheid variable stars arise from a different parent population , with intermediate masses and ages .",
    "there is no evidence for a population of foreground objects among the 1500 cepheids found in the inner 22 fields of the lmc ( alcock et al . 1995 ) .",
    "note that every cepheid would be accompanied by about 100 times their number in main - sequence b - type stars , which are not present .",
    "rr lyrae and cepheid stars represent rare stages of stellar evolution",
    ". it may then be possible that only a few of them belonging to an intervening dwarf galaxy would be present in the fields explored here .",
    "core he - burning clump giants should be much more numerous , since stellar evolution theory predicts that many low mass stars go through this phase of evolution .",
    "we have assembled macho project photometry , properly calibrated to @xmath7 and @xmath31 , for 9 million stars in the lmc bar region into a composite color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the large number of stars in this diagram reveal many low level features tracing short - lived stages of stellar evolution .",
    "the region of the color - magnitude diagram near the red giant branch and locus of clump giants is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the clump giants peak near @xmath32 mag and @xmath33 mag .",
    "there is an extra `` bump '' seen near @xmath34 mag and @xmath35 mag .",
    "zaritsky ( 1997 ) sees a similar feature in the lmc .",
    "the color of the bump is inconsistent with these stars being clump giants from the lmc or smc residing in a tidal tail or stream .",
    "if the bump stars are clump giants of a dwarf galaxy in front of the lmc , they are likely of higher metallicity than the lmc clump giants , since reddening can not account for their color . while some of these bump stars are likely clump - clump blends , the naturally occurring stellar populations of the lmc are the most plausible explanation for this feature .",
    "a detailed analysis of the 9 million star color - magnitude diagram using lmc cluster photometry , theoretical isochrones , and macho variable star data will be presented elsewhere ( alves , 1998 ) .",
    "it is very difficult to detect overlapping nearby galaxies , as proven by the recent discovery of the sgr dwarf behind the milky way bulge .",
    "effective ways of searching for such systems would be distance indicators ( rr lyrae stars , cepheid stars , clump giants , discussed above ) , radial velocity surveys , and star counts .",
    "extensive star counts and surface brightness work by de vaucouleurs ( 1955 ) , and more recently by bothun & thompson ( 1988 ) show no evidence for anything that is not lmc - centric .",
    "if there were such a galaxy , we should be able to see a distinctive old main - sequence turn - off in deep hst photometry .",
    "this is because main sequence turn - off stars are much more numerous than the tracers discussed above .",
    "a clear example of this is the detection of the main sequence turn - off of the sgr galaxy behind the bulge by fahlman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using wfpc2 photometry .",
    "olszewski et al . (",
    "1996 ) review the recent color - magnitude diagrams of the lmc .",
    "we note that none of the recent deep hst color - magnitude diagrams of the lmc ( e.g. elson et al .",
    "1994 , holtzman et al 1997 ) show such an extra stellar component .",
    "different authors have published radial velocities of giant stars in lmc fields ( see olszewski et al .",
    "no evidence is found for grouping in velocity space of stars that may belong to a dwarf galaxy in front of the lmc .    also , the sgr dwarf has four globular clusters sharing the same kinematics and spatial distribution ( dacosta & armandroff 1995 ) .",
    "however , the old globular clusters located in the direction of the lmc have kinematics and distances consistent with membership to this galaxy ( suntzeff et al . 1992 ) , and there is no evidence for clusters belonging to an unknown sgr - like dwarf galaxy .",
    "the presence of a gas rich dwarf galaxy ( dirr ) is also ruled out because we do not see large amounts of gas in front of the lmc .",
    "extensive searches have only revealed hi detection belonging to gas in the magellanic stream ( rohlfs et al .",
    "1984 , heller & rohlfs 1994 ) . even though there is evidence for interstellar lines at many velocities in high resolution spectra of sn  1987a ( savage et al . 1989 ) , absorption line studies of lmc stars do not reveal an significant gaseous component other than that of the milky way or the lmc disk ( westerlund 1990 , roth & blades 1997 ) . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no other evidence reported in the literature regarding a galaxy in front of the lmc .",
    "we have tested the idea of zhao ( 1996 ) that the microlensing events observed in lmc fields may be due to an intervening dwarf galaxy like the sgr dwarf .",
    "searching for foreground rr lyrae in the year - one macho photometry database yielded 20 stars whose distribution follows the expected halo density law .",
    "these foreground rr lyrae represent 0.3% of the total number of lmc rr lyrae stars with similar colors detected in these fields .",
    "classical cepheid variable stars and clump giants seen in the macho database are consistent with membership in the lmc .",
    "we do not find any evidence for the stellar component of such a dwarf galaxy in the macho database , from which we conclude that if the lenses are indeed in a foreground galaxy , this must be a particularly dark galaxy . alternatively , some of the microlensing events may be due to an extended tidal tail ( zhao 1997 ) .",
    "this is more difficult to test with the present data , but could be addressed when other lines of sight ( such as the smc ) are studied .",
