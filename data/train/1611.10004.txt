    ", an effort has begun to calculate such observables using effective field theory ( eft ) approaches . in eft , the ratio of two separated scales is used as an expansion parameter in a systematic low - energy expansion in the calculation of observables .",
    "the low - energy scale is usually a small momentum scale @xmath4 while the second scale @xmath5 is frequently related to the lightest exchange particle or lowest lying excitation not included in the theory .",
    "the eft then has to preserve all symmetries of the fundamental theory and the resulting lagrangian includes only the relevant degrees of freedom while heavier excitations are integrated out of the theory .",
    "thus , one can obtain an expression of non - renormalizable interactions which can be organized as a power series in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "chiral effective field theory identifies the pion as a goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd , stemming from the small masses of the up and down quarks .",
    "the finite mass of the pion originates from the explicit chiral symmetry breaking , _",
    "i.e. _ the non - zero up and down quark masses .",
    "this framework has been used to construct a nuclear interaction that describes nuclear spectra and scattering observables to very high accuracy @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to construct the nuclear electroweak current operator and for subsequent calculations @xcite .",
    "these calculations have highlighted the benefit of an approach in which current operators and the interaction between nucleons are treated consistently .",
    "the electroweak properties of the three - nucleon system are particularly important since these observables can be used to constrain parameters in the three - nucleon force of chiral effective theory .",
    "the so - called pionless eft ( eft@xmath7 ) is an alternative eft approach to light nuclei that is particularly useful at the low energies that are of interest for astrophysical processes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8140 mev .",
    "the interactions in eft@xmath7are constructed using only contact interactions , and the pion mass sets therefore the breakdown scale of this approach @xcite .",
    "using this theory all particles but nucleons are `` integrated out '' .",
    "in addition , the strong interaction characterizing qcd at low energies , leads to a scale separation between the scattering length @xmath9 and the range of the interaction @xmath10 .",
    "eft@xmath7exploits this ratio as an expansion parameter .",
    "thus , eft@xmath7at leading order is a quantum field theoretical formulation of the zero - range limit , in which the range of an interaction is taken to zero . as a consequence",
    ", a three - body force is needed at leading order for the description of three - nucleon systems within this framework , that is directly related to the well - known efimov effect @xcite .",
    "since the binding energies of nuclei with @xmath11 are small ( _ i.e. _ @xmath12 mev ) , those nuclei can indeed be described using eft@xmath7@xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction in light nuclei is an additional complication .",
    "the coulomb interaction is nonperturbative at low momenta @xmath13 , as can be seen in the strong renormalization of the proton - proton scattering length , but should be perturbative in nuclei where the typical momenta are much higher .",
    "@xmath1he is the lightest , and therefore simplest , nucleus to test the combination of eft@xmath7and coulomb interaction @xcite and many recent works have discussed this problem . in particular , it was shown that while at leading order ( lo ) @xmath1he is described correctly within eft@xmath7 , at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) the results are not so clear , and some approaches have shows the need for additional , isospin dependent , three - body forces .",
    "then additional three - nucleon observables are needed to obtain predictive power within eft@xmath7at nlo @xcite .",
    "one of the ways to additionally test the predictions of eft@xmath7for the structure of the three - nucleon system at nlo is through the aforementioned electroweak properties of light nuclear systems .",
    "this is the goal of this paper in which we aim at describing tritium @xmath0-decay .",
    "this observable is particularly interesting since it is well - known experimentally , and can be used to determine the short - range strength of the axial coupling to nuclei , required for a high - accuracy description of the astrophysically relevant proton - proton fusion rate @xcite . in the context of eft@xmath7 , this coupling at nlo is represented by a low - energy constant @xmath2 , whose exact value is a matter of discussion in the literature @xcite .",
    "the large uncertainty in the current determination of @xmath2 is the source of this discussion .",
    "it is thus called for to check the triton decay within eft@xmath7 , as a method to fix this parameter @xcite .",
    "moreover , this provides additional eft checks , which were not considered in the context of triton decay to date , such renormalization group invariance , convergence pattern of the eft , and existence of terms with large fluctuations within the nlo contribution .",
