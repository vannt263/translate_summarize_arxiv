    "as the density of granular particles increases to a critical packing fraction , @xmath0 , the system undergoes a _ jamming transition _ from a liquid - like to a solid - like state @xcite . for large particles",
    "thermal fluctuations are irrelevant , and in the absence of mechanical agitation , the dense system relaxes into a mechanically stable _ rigid _ but _ disordered _ configuration . given a set of macroscopic constrains there are in general a large number of such configurations that are accessible to the system .",
    "a long standing question is whether there is a convenient statistical description for the properties of such quenched configurations .",
    "for hard - core , rough ( i.e. frictional ) , particles , the jamming @xmath0 ( and hence the system volume at jamming ) may span a range of values from random loose packed to random close packed .",
    "edwards and co - workers @xcite proposed a statistical description for the distribution of the voronoi volume of such particles in terms of a maximum entropy hypothesis , assuming that all accessible states are equally likely .",
    "henkes and co - workers @xcite extended these ideas to consider the distribution of stress on clusters of particles within packings of frictionless soft particles , compressed _ above _ the jamming @xmath0 .",
    "they denoted their formalism as the _ stress ensemble_. similar ideas were then proposed by blumenfeld and edwards @xcite .",
    "subsequently , tighe and co - workers @xcite , using an idealized model called the force - network ensemble ( fne ) , argued that in two dimensions the maxwell - cremona force - tile area acts as an additional constraining variable , that must be taken into account in order to arrive at a correct maximum entropy description of the stress distribution .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have sought to test such statistical models .    the main goal of this work is to numerically investigate these statistical ensemble ideas as applied to the distribution of stress , and in particular to test if the analysis of tighe and co - workers for the idealized fne , continues to hold in a more realistic model of jammed soft - core particles . to this end",
    "we carry out detailed numerical simulations of a simple model of two dimensional , soft - core , bidisperse frictionless disks , to determine the distribution of stress and force - tile area on compact clusters of particles embedded in a larger , mechanically stable , packing at finite isotropic stress above the jamming transition . measuring behavior as a function of both the cluster size and the total system stress , we find that the stress distribution is consistent with the maximum entropy hypothesis , provided one takes both the cluster stress and the force - tile area as constraining variables that characterize the distribution .",
    "we find that it remains necessary to consider both variables even as the cluster size gets large , contrary to results reported for the fne @xcite .",

    "we use a ratio of cluster stress distributions at different values of the total system stress to investigate the boltzmann factor predicted for the distribution , and find that this boltzmann factor includes a term quadratic in the cluster stress , rather than being linear in the stress as predicted by the stress ensemble .",
    "we compare our results against a simpler gaussian approximation , and find that the quadratic boltzmann factor gives a better description .",

    "we make comparison between the temperature - like parameters resulting from this ratio analysis and those predicted from fluctuations via the covariance matrix of the constraining variables , and find reasonable , though not perfect , agreement .",
