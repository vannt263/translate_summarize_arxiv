    "there have been numerous studies of the effect of confinement on the dynamics of rigid particles @xcite , deformable drops @xcite , and macromolecules @xcite in creeping flow in a parallel - wall channel .",

    "confinement - induced multiparticle collective phenomena often emerge as a result of hydrodynamic interactions associated with the far - field form of the flow produced by the particles moving in the channel @xcite . due to confinement",
    ", this flow qualitatively differs from the far - field flow caused by particle motion in free space .",
    "the difference stems from the strong fluid - volume conservation constraint associated with the wall presence , and from absorption of momentum by the walls .",
    "owing to the momentum absorption , the velocity field decays too fast to produce a nonzero fluid flux through the boundary at infinity .",
    "therefore , the fluid displaced by a moving particle creates a backflow pattern @xcite in order to ensure fluid incompressibility .",

    "the dipolar character of the velocity field around a spherical particle results from the cylindrical symmetry of the problem .    an immediate consequence of the backflow effect is the negative sign of the transverse component of the two - particle mutual hydrodynamic - mobility coefficient @xcite .",
    "the backflow also causes a large resistance of elongated particles in a narrow channel @xcite .",
    "furthermore , collective action of the dipolar flow fields produced by individual particles gives rise to propagation of particle - displacement waves in linear particle arrays in poiseuille flow @xcite , and it governs macroscopic deformation and lattice rearrangements in regular particle arrays @xcite .    the dipolar far - field flow produced by the particles in a channel is crucial not only for understanding suspension dynamics on the particle scale , but also for describing the macroscopic fluid and particle transport .",
    "we show that particle contribution to the macroscopic volume flux in suspension flow through the channel can be determined from the amplitudes of the dipolar hele  shaw far - field flows produced by the particles .",
