    "the controversy over the expectation value of the intrinsic ground - state angular momentum of the @xmath5-phase of superfluid @xmath6he in a given container has a long history , and it has not yet attained a universally agreed resolution  @xcite . for @xmath7 weakly - interacting particles , theoretical predictions for the bcs ground state vary orders of magnitude from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the amplitude of the order parameter , i.e. pairing energy , and @xmath11 is the fermi energy . at a first glance , the former expectation , which is based on the observation that pairing affects not all but only a small fraction @xmath12 of fermions , seems more intuitive . however , this subject has recently regained interest in condensed - matter and atomic and molecular physics communities due to its relevance to the possible @xmath13-superconducting phase of sr@xmath14ruo@xmath15  @xcite and atomic chiral @xmath4-wave superfluids  @xcite , respectively , supporting for the latter expectation  @xcite . on one hand , these recent results seem intuitive at least in the strong fermion attraction limit of tightly - bound @xmath4-wave cooper molecules , where all of the molecules can undergo bec at zero temperature with each molecule having a microscopic angular momentum @xmath16 . on the other hand , they seem counterintuitive in the weak fermion attraction limit of loosely bound and largely overlapping @xmath4-wave cooper pairs , since these results imply that the angular momentum in the bcs ground state is macroscopically different from its vanishing value in the normal ground state , when the pairing energy becomes arbitrarily small . while this controversy still awaits for an experimental resolution , here we propose an alternative atomic system where the microscopic angular momentum of cooper pairs can also give rise to a macroscopic one . with their unique advantages over the condensed - matter systems , it is plausible that the macroscopic angular momentum of this alternative system may be observed for the first time with cold atoms , and that this would also shed some light on the @xmath6he controversy for which the basic mechanism is found to be similar .",
    "cold atom systems have already proved to be versatile in simulating various many - body problems .",
    "for instance , one of the major achievements with atomic fermi gases in the past decade is the unprecedented realization of the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite , where the ground state of the system can be continuously tuned from the bcs to the bec limit as a function of increasing fermion attraction with the turn of a knob .",
    "the main difference between the bcs - bec crossover and the bcs theory is that the cooper pairing is allowed not only for fermions with energies close to the fermi energy but also for all pairs with appropriate momenta  @xcite .",
    "having established the basic tools , it is arguable that one of the most promising research directions to pursue with cold fermi gases is the artificial spin - orbit gauge fields . such a field has already been realized with cold bose gases  @xcite using a novel technique based on spatially - dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms , and the same technique is equally applicable for neutral fermionic atoms .",
    "in fact , we have recently learned that the first generation of quantum degenerate spin - orbit coupled fermi gases has recently been created with @xmath17k atoms  @xcite .",
    "this immediate possibility of creating a spin - orbit coupled fermi gas has already received tremendous theoretical interest in condensed - matter and atomic physics communities , exploring a number of exotic superfluid phases with balanced or imbalanced populations , at zero or finite temperatures , in two or three dimensions , etc .",
    "@xcite . motivated by these recent advances , here we study",
    "ground - state and finite - temperature phases of trapped spin - orbit coupled fermi gases , and our main results are as follows .",
    "we find that the presence of a spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) spontaneously induces counterflowing @xmath0 and @xmath1 mass currents in the vicinity of the trap edge  @xcite .",
    "we show that these currents flow even in noninteracting systems , and that they are quite robust against the effects of asymmetric soc in @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions , gradually reducing to zero as the soc becomes one dimensional .",
    "however , their strength decreases toward the molecular bec limit , which can be achieved either by increasing the soc or the interaction strength .",
    "we argue that the origin of spontaneously induced counterflowing mass currents in spin - orbit coupled fermi gases can be understood via a direct correspondence with the chiral @xmath4-wave superfluids / superconductors , however , with some fundamental differences in between .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] , first we introduce the mean - field hamiltonian that is used to describe the spin - orbit coupled fermi gases on optical lattices , and then use the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) formalism to obtain the generalized self - consistency equations for the number of fermions , superfluid order parameter , and strength of circulating mass currents .",
    "the numerical solutions of this formalism are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , which is followed by a brief discussion on their experimental realization in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we summarize our main findings in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this paper , we consider a harmonically trapped two - dimensional optical lattice in the presence of a non - abelian gauge potential .",
    "in addition to the usual spin - conserving hopping terms , the main effect of such a gauge potential is the appearance of an additional spin - flipping hopping term in the single - particle kinetic energy term as discussed next .",
    "spin - orbit coupled fermi gases on optical lattices can be described by the grand - canonical mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath18 where the operator @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) creates ( annihilates ) a pseudo - spin @xmath21 fermion at lattice site @xmath22 , the spinor @xmath23 denotes the fermion operators collectively , @xmath24 allows only nearest - neighbor hopping , and @xmath25 is the hermitian conjugate . for a generic gauge field @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the pauli matrix and @xmath28 are independent parameters characterizing both the strength and the symmetry of the spin - orbit coupling , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fermions gain @xmath29 phase factors for hopping in the positive @xmath2 direction and @xmath30 phase factors for hopping in the positive @xmath3 direction .",
    "note that the spin - conserving and spin - flipping hopping terms are proportional , respectively , to @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the @xmath2 direction , and to @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the off - diagonal coupling @xmath35 is the mean - field superfluid order parameter to be specified below , and @xmath36 is the hartree term where @xmath37 is the strength of the onsite attractive interaction and @xmath38 is the filling of @xmath39 fermions at site @xmath22 . here , @xmath40 and vice versa .",
    "we introduce @xmath39-dependent chemical potentials @xmath41 to fix the number of @xmath39 fermions independently , but we assume both @xmath0 and @xmath1 fermions feel the same trapping potential @xmath42 , where the distance @xmath43 is measured from the center in our @xmath44 lattice .",
    "next , we solve this hamiltonian via bdg formalism .",
    "the bdg equations are obtained by diagonalizing the quadratic hamiltonian given above via a generalized bogoliubov - valatin transformation , leading to a @xmath45 matrix - eigenvalue problem , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the components of the @xmath49th quasiparticle wave function at site @xmath22 , and @xmath50 is the corresponding energy eigenvalue . while the off - diagonal couplings are @xmath51 diagonal in site indices since we consider onsite interactions only , the nearest - neighbor hopping and onsite energy terms can be written compactly as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the kronecker delta . here , the non - vanishing nearest - neighbor hopping elements are @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the positive @xmath2 direction , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the positive @xmath3 direction .",
    "note that the hopping in the negative @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions are simply the hermitian conjugates .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : bdg.matrix ] ) needs to be solved simultaneously with the order parameter @xmath58 and number @xmath59 equations for a self - consistent set of @xmath35 and @xmath41 solutions . here",
    ", @xmath60 is a thermal average . using the bogoliubov - valatin transformation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 , \\\\",
    "\\label{eqn : number } n_{\\sigma i } & = \\sum_n \\big [ |u_{n i}^\\sigma|^2 f(\\varepsilon_n ) + |v_{n i}^\\sigma|^2 f(-\\varepsilon_n ) \\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the fermi - dirac distribution function and @xmath63 is the temperature . here , we set the boltzmann constant @xmath64 to unity .",
    "note that @xmath65 is the number of @xmath39 fermions at site @xmath22 ( number filling ) in such a way that @xmath66 gives the total number of @xmath39 fermions .",
    "equations  ( [ eqn : bdg.matrix]-  [ eqn : number ] ) correspond to the generalization of the bdg equations  @xcite to the case of spin - orbit coupled fermi gases on optical lattices .",
    "once we obtain the self - consistent solutions for the quasiparticle wave functions and the corresponding energy spectrum , it is straightforward to calculate any of the desired observables .",
    "for instance , in this paper we are interested in the quantum mechanical probability - current ( mass- or particle - current ) of @xmath39 fermions at site @xmath22 defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath69th component . using the bogoliubov - valatin transformation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath70,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we set the lattice spacing and @xmath16 to unity . in our two - dimensional system",
    ", we expect mass currents to circulate around the central site , so that @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "in addition , the local angular - momentum associated with such a circulating mass current is in the @xmath73 direction , and its magnitude at a particular site @xmath22 is simply related to the local mass current by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the coordinates of site @xmath22 with respect to the center , i.e. minimum of the trapping potential . in this paper , we are interested in the total absolute angular momentum per @xmath39 particle which is given by @xmath77    having established the bdg formalism , now we are ready to present our numerical solutions for the ground - state and finite - temperature phases , which are obtained by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : bdg.matrix]-  [ eqn : number ] ) in a self - consistent manner .",
    "our numerical calculations are performed on a two - dimensional square lattice with @xmath78 lattice sites in each direction .",
    "we take @xmath79 as the strength of the trapping potential , and discuss both symmetric ( @xmath80 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath81 ) soc fields .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the low - filling population - balanced systems , we set @xmath82 , and study the resultant phases as a function of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "however , we briefly comment on the effects of high filling and population imbalance on the ground - state phases toward the end of this section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : current1 ] , we show the strength of the @xmath0 mass current @xmath86 at zero temperature ( @xmath87 ) for noninteracting ( @xmath88 ) systems with symmetric and asymmetric soc , where we set @xmath89 and vary @xmath85 parameter .",
    "we use fig .",
    "[ fig : current1](a ) as our reference data in all of our discussions below . first of all , the coarse - grained data near the trap center is a finite - size lattice effect and it does not affect our main findings .",
    "in addition , due to the time - reversal symmetry , @xmath90 has exactly the opposite circulation for population - balanced systems and this current is not shown throughout this paper . as @xmath85 decreases from the symmetric case with @xmath91 to @xmath92 , the asymmetry between @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions increase in such a way that the spin - flipping hopping gradually decreases to zero in the @xmath3 direction , and the soc field eventually becomes purely one dimensional in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "we find that the mass current flows as long as the soc field has both @xmath2 and @xmath3 components , and its strength decreases gradually as a function of increasing the asymmetry of soc fields .",
    "note that since the asymmetric soc breaks the @xmath93 symmetry of the square lattice , the resultant mass currents also have reduced symmetry in figs .",
    "[ fig : current1](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "in addition , we see that the gas expands a little bit with increasing asymmetry , which is due to the decrease in density of single - particle states .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : current2 ] , we show the mass current @xmath94 and filling @xmath95 of @xmath0 fermions at @xmath87 for noninteracting systems with varying symmetric soc strengths @xmath80 . we find that @xmath96 first increases and then decreases as @xmath80 is increased from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "it is expected that the strength of the mass current rapidly increases as a function of increasing spin - flipping hopping with respect to the spin - conserving ones , since the presence of a nonzero soc is what allowed the mass current to form in the first place . however , as the soc terms dominate , the chemical potential gradually drops below the band minimum , and then the system gradually crosses over to the molecular bec side .",
    "we note that in contrast to the no - soc case where the formation of a two - body bound state between @xmath0 and @xmath1 fermions requires a finite interaction threshold in a two - dimensional lattice , here it can form even for arbitrarily small interactions simply by increasing the soc , due to the increased single - particle density of states .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the rapid increase in the strength of the mass current is followed by a gradual decrease at larger soc , and that the mass current eventually vanishes at sufficiently large soc . in addition",
    ", we see that the gas shrinks with increasing soc , which is again due to the increased density of states .",
    "note that the ratio between the trapping potential and the effective hopping terms also increases as @xmath80 increases from 0 to @xmath98 .",
    "we also calculate the absolute angular momentum per particle @xmath99 and find approximately @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( in units of @xmath16 ) , when @xmath80 is set to @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : current3 ] , we show the mass current @xmath94 and filling @xmath95 of @xmath0 fermions at @xmath87 for symmetric ( @xmath106 ) soc with varying interaction strength @xmath83 .",
    "the corresponding superfluid order parameter @xmath107 has an approximately peak value of @xmath97 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 at the trap center when @xmath83 equals to @xmath97 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively ( not shown ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that increasing the @xmath83 has qualitatively the same effect on the ground - state phases as increasing the soc .",
    "for instance , we find that the mass current first increases and then decreases as a function of increasing @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , the gas shrinks with increasing @xmath83 , due to the formation of more tightly - bound cooper pairs .",
    "we again calculate the absolute angular momentum per particle @xmath99 and find approximately @xmath100 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( in units of @xmath16 ) , when @xmath83 is set to @xmath97 , @xmath109 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 again deviates significantly from @xmath115 as a result of increased filling around the trap center .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : current4 ] , we show the mass current @xmath94 and filling @xmath95 of @xmath0 fermions for noninteracting systems with varying temperature @xmath63 , where we set symmetric ( @xmath106 ) soc . since finite temperature excites more and more particles to higher oscillator states as a function of increasing @xmath63 , and this naturally leads to an increase in the system size , and decrease in the strength of the mass currents .",
    "this is clearly seen in the figure , where the peak value of @xmath94 reduces approximately to half of its @xmath87 value when @xmath116 , but with a larger width .",
    "we calculate the absolute angular momentum per particle @xmath99 and find approximately @xmath100 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( in units of @xmath16 ) , when @xmath63 is set to @xmath97 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 decreases significantly from its ground - state value @xmath115 as the temperature increases .",
    "so far we only discussed population - balanced systems with a low filling at the trap center , i.e. @xmath121 , and here we briefly comment on the effects of high filling and population imbalance on the ground - state phases  @xcite .",
    "first of all , due to the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian around @xmath122 , in addition to the mass - current peak circulating in the vicinity of the trap edge , an additional peak that is circulating mostly near the trap center is induced when the trap center is close to a band insulator , i.e. @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , mass currents show a double - ring structure in high - filling lattice systems .",
    "second , the strengths of mass currents are quite robust against the effects of imbalanced populations . for instance , when the total number of @xmath1 fermions is reduced from @xmath124 in fig .",
    "[ fig : current1](a ) to @xmath125 while keeping @xmath126 fixed , so that @xmath127 and @xmath128 at the trap center , the maximum currents @xmath129 occur about the same radial distance as the population - balanced case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current1](a ) .",
    "having established the qualitative behavior of spontaneously induced counterflowing mass currents in spin - orbit coupled fermi gases , next we argue that the origin of these currents can be understood via a direct correspondence with the chiral @xmath4-wave superfluids / superconductors .",
    "the origin of spontaneously induced counterflowing mass currents near the trap edge can be understood via a direct correspondence with the @xmath13-superfluids / superconductors , e.g. @xmath5 phase of liquid @xmath6he , for which it is known that a spontaneous mass current also flows near the boundary  @xcite . in these @xmath4-wave systems , the mass current and hence the macroscopic angular momentum",
    "is associated with the chirality of cooper pairs .",
    "the chirality can be most easily seen by noting that the chiral @xmath4-wave order parameter @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the relative momentum of a cooper pair , is an eigenfunction of the orbital angular momentum with eigenvalue @xmath132 .",
    "this mechanism explains our findings since it can be shown that the order parameter of spin - orbit coupled fermi gases with rashba - type soc and @xmath133-wave contact interactions has chiral @xmath4-wave symmetry . to see",
    "this one needs to transform the hamiltonian to the helicity basis , i.e. the pseudo - spin is no longer a good quantum number in the presence of a soc , and the spin direction is either parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of in - plane momentum in the @xmath134 helicity basis . in the helicity - basis representation , it becomes clear that only intraband cooper pairing occurs between fermions with same helicity , and that the order parameter for @xmath134 helicity pairing has @xmath135 symmetry  @xcite .    although the basic mechanism in chiral @xmath4-wave systems and spin - orbit coupled fermi gases share some similarities with respect to spontaneously induced edge currents , they also differ in fundamental ways . for instance , in contrast to the chiral @xmath4-wave systems where the formation of cooper pairs and hence the mass current requires an interacting system , in spin - orbit coupled fermi gases currents flow even in the absence of interactions .",
    "in addition , the chiral @xmath4-wave systems belong to the topological class of integer quantum hall systems , and since these systems both break time - reversal symmetry , they exhibit spontaneous edge currents circulating along a particular direction . however , spin - orbit coupled fermi gases preserve time - reversal symmetry just like quantum spin hall systems , and therefore , they both exhibit spontaneously induced counterflowing @xmath0 and @xmath1 edge currents . next , we comment on the experimental realization of spontaneously induced edge currents in atomic systems .      in comparison to bulk ( center )",
    "effects , there is no doubt that the edge effects are more difficult to observe in trapped atomic systems .",
    "this is because as the local density decreases from the central region to the edges , it gets harder to probe local properties .",
    "in addition , the local critical superfluid temperature eventually drops below the temperature of the system near the edges , and the superfluidity is also lost starting from the edges inwards .",
    "one way to partially overcome such problems could be to load the optical lattice potential with higher particle fillings such that the trap center is close to a band insulator , i.e. unit filling . in this case",
    ", an additional mass - current peak circulates mostly near the trap center ( see above ) , and such a local current could be easier to probe with current experimental capabilities .",
    "the measurement of the angular momentum of rotating atomic systems have so far only been achieved indirectly , by observing the shift of the radial quadrupole modes .",
    "while this technique was initially used for rotating atomic becs  @xcite , it has recently been applied to the rotating fermionic superfluids in the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite .",
    "we believe a similar technique could be used for measuring the intrinsic angular momentum of spin - orbit coupled fermi gases , which may provide an indirect evidence for counterflowing mass currents .",
    "in addition , we note that a realistic scheme has recently been proposed to detect topological edge states in an optical lattice under a synthetic magnetic field  @xcite . this proposal is based on a generalization of bragg spectroscopy that is sensitive to angular momentum .",
    "to conclude , we showed that the presence of a rashba - type soc spontaneously induces counterflowing @xmath0 and @xmath1 mass currents .",
    "while these currents have a single peak that is circulating mostly near the trap edge in low - filling lattice systems , an additional peak that is circulating mostly near the trap center is also induced in high - filling lattice systems , exhibiting a double - ring structure .",
    "we note that our results for the low - filling lattice systems are directly applicable to the dilute systems ( without the optical lattice potential ) , for which we expect qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "these currents flow even in noninteracting systems , and they are quite robust against the effects of imbalanced populations and/or asymmetric soc in @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions .",
    "however , their strength decreases toward the molecular bec limit , which can be achieved either by increasing the soc or the interaction strength .",
    "we argued that the origin of spontaneously induced counterflowing mass currents in spin - orbit coupled fermi gases can be understood via a direct correspondence with the chiral @xmath4-wave superfluids / superconductors , however , with some fundamental differences in between .",
