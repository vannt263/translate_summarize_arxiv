    "open quantum systems attract attention in both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite research .",
    "the theoretical investigation of open quantum systems uses a great variety of different tools @xcite .",
    "typically , these methods allow the determination of a reduced density matrix @xcite or a quantum state vector @xcite of an open quantum system .",
    "usually , the reduced density operator carries also unnecessary information about different correlations in the open quantum system that are inaccessible to experimental observation . to study only the relevant information about an open quantum system it is appropriate to use methods of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "as for the theoretical study of open quantum systems , several approaches to non - equilibrium thermodynamics have been proposed .",
    "these include methods based on projection operators by robertson @xcite , mori @xcite , kawasaki and gunton @xcite , zubarev s non - equilibrium statistical operator @xcite , or more recently the generic formalism by ttinger and grmela @xcite . at first sight",
    "these methods seem to differ from each other and often they are different from canonical methods used in the theory of open quantum systems @xcite . nevertheless , all the methods mentioned above are based on similar ideas and can be used for the description of open quantum systems .    in this article",
    "we apply concepts of non - equilibrium thermodynamics to open quantum systems and derive an alternative local in time non - markovian master equation .",
    "after that , we illustrate the formalism with the description of the dynamics and thermodynamics of two open quantum systems , namely , the damped harmonic oscillator and the damped driven two - level system .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the main ideas of non - equilibrium thermodynamics and derive a new type of local in time master equation . the short section iii deals with thermodynamical relations , which follows from the considered formalism . in section iv we apply our formalism to a general open system . in sections v and",
    "vi we study two concrete open systems , namely , the damped harmonical oscillator and the driven two level system . finally , in section vii we conclude .",
    "some additional details are discussed in several appendices .",
    "non - equilibrium thermodynamics is based on two general assumptions @xcite : ( i ) the non - equilibrium macroscopic state is specified by a set of observables which are the average values @xmath0 of some relevant dynamical variables @xmath1 , where the superscript @xmath2 indicates time - dependence .",
    "these variables give the reduced description of the system on the chosen time scale .",
    "the existence of different time scales is due to the `` hierarchy '' of basic relaxation times in macroscopic systems ; ( ii ) in order to obtain a closed system of generalized transport equations for the observables , we have to construct a special solution of the liouville equation , which is a functional of these observables .",
    "the hypothesis of the `` hierarchy '' of basic relaxation times implies that a relaxation of a system goes sequentially through several stages .",
    "the closer the system comes to equilibrium the fewer relevant variables are necessary . in many cases",
    "the equilibrium state is defined only by one parameter , namely , the free energy or the thermodynamically conjugate entropy . further away from equilibrium ,",
    "the number of relevant variables increases .",
    "once a set of relevant variables is chosen , one can move to the second assumption above .    here",
    "we construct the relevant distribution from the principle of maximum information entropy @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density operator of the system .",
    "this idea lies at the basis of many methods of non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , but , traditionally , is ignored in the theory of open quantum systems .",
    "the relevant distribution , which maximizes the information entropy , has the following form @xmath5 where the massieu - planck function @xmath6 , is determined from the normalization condition for the relevant distribution and has the form @xmath7 the lagrange multipliers @xmath8 are determined from the self - consistency conditions @xmath9    to derive the dynamical equation for @xmath10 it is effective to use some kind of projection operator @xmath11 , which satisfies the condition @xmath12 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary solution of the liouville equation .",
    "one of the most general types of projection operators , was introduced by kawasaki and gunton @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent kawasaki - gunton projection operator @xmath13 acts on an arbitrary operator @xmath14 as @xmath15 notice , that the kawasaki - gunton projection operator generalizes other types of time - dependent projection operators @xcite .",
    "for example , the robertson @xcite and mori @xcite projectors can be easily obtained as a partial case of . moreover",
    ", the kawasaki - gunton projection operator technique can be directly connected to zubarev s non - equilibrium statistical operator @xcite .",
    "once the projection operator is chosen one can apply a standard procedure to derive a master equation @xcite .",
    "the resulting master equation has a structure , which is analogue to the famous nakajima - zwanzig master equation @xcite , but is now more complicated due to the explicit time - dependence of the projection operators . at this stage ,",
    "a variety of different approaches can be used , that where developed for the simplification of the nakajima - zwanzig master equation . with the help of the so - called , time - convolutionless projection operator technique ( tcl ) @xcite",
    "the integro - differential nakajima - zwanzig equation can be cast in the form of a differential equation due to the inversion of the evolution of the total system and manipulation of the integral term in the master equation .",
    "application of the tcl technique to the kawasaki - gunton master equation leads to a master equation local in time of the following form @xmath16 where @xmath17^{-1}\\mathcal{p}(t),$ ] @xmath18^{-1}\\mathcal{g}(t , t_0)\\mathcal{q}(t_0),$ ] @xmath19 @xmath20 the superoperators @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the propagator and the inverse propagator , while the symbol @xmath24 denotes the chronological ( antichronological ) ordering ; @xmath25 is the liouville superoperator .",
    "notice , that formally eq .   has the same structure of a traditional tcl master equation @xcite , except for the explicit time - dependence of the projectors . at the same time eq .   is a new type of a master equation , which has a few significant differences from the traditional one .",
    "some of them will be discussed below .",
    "the master equation relates to the known kawasaki - gunton master equation @xcite like the traditional nakajima - zwanzig master equation @xcite relates to the tcl master equation @xcite .",
    "namely , ( i ) they have the same ranges of applicability ; ( ii ) the differential tcl master equation is simpler to study than the corresponding integro - differential nakajima - zwanzig master equation ; and an additional interesting fact @xcite ( iii ) the tcl master equation describes the exact dynamics of the systems more accurately than the corresponding nakajima - zwanzig master equation of the same order.for these reason we consider the equation to be an interesting new type of master equations .",
    "an amazing feature of the above theory is the explicit connection between the dynamical variables and the thermodynamic parameters that resemble the relations in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "let us define the entropy corresponding to the statistical operator . from the self - consistency conditions we have @xmath26 using eqs .   and",
    "one easily finds the following relations @xmath27 note , that the index @xmath28 in the above equation may be continuous , in this case partial derivations must be replaced by functional derivatives and sums must be replaced by integrals .",
    "now , we turn to the construction of the relevant distributions for open quantum systems . traditionally , an open system is supposed to consist of two weakly interacting parts @xcite .",
    "the weak interaction means that the correlation between the parts does not necessarily have to be taken into account and the density operators of the total system may be chosen as a direct product of density operators , corresponding to its subsystems .",
    "one part , called a thermostat or a bath , is a large system with a huge number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this subsystem is usually assumed to be in some equilibrium state .",
    "the most commonly used thermal equilibrium state is characterized by the free energy only and the density operator for such state is written as @xmath29/\\mathrm{tr}\\exp[-\\beta h],$ ] where @xmath30 is the inverse equilibrium temperature and @xmath31 is the hamiltonian of the thermostat . the second part of the total system , namely the open system itself , is generally assumed to be in some non - equilibrium state .",
    "unfortunately , there is no universal criterion for the choice of the relevant variables for this case . for a low - dimensional system one can choose all possible dynamical variables as relevant , and",
    "the above theory is completely equivalent to the traditional nakajima - zwanzig approach . on the other hand , infinite dimensional systems , or even high - dimensional systems ,",
    "do not allow to consider all possible sets of dynamical variables . in this case",
    "the set of relevant variables must be limited .",
    "let us assume that the open system consists of one component or several weakly interacting components , labelled by @xmath32 .",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath33 the creation operator @xmath34 and the occupation numbers operator @xmath35 can be chosen as relevant variables for such a system @xcite . in other words , this set includes momentum or position and energy of the @xmath32th component of the open system , which are directly accessible to experiments . in the case of strongly interacting parts of an open system individual characteristics of the parts are not relevant and the set of observables has to be chosen as @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "thus , the relevant distribution for an open system , can be written as follows @xmath39\\otimes \\exp[-\\beta h_b],\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the hamiltonian of the thermostat , @xmath41 is the set of relevant variables , which characterise the @xmath42th subsystem of the open system , and @xmath43 are the massieu - planck functions of the subsystems .",
    "below we present examples to illustrate the suggested approach .",
    "the simplest model of an open system is the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the rotating wave hamiltonian of the system is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the boson annihilation and creation operators , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the annihilation and creation operators of @xmath49th oscillator in the bath , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the frequencies of the oscillator and @xmath49th oscillator in the bath and @xmath52 are the interaction strengths.the first step of the formalism is to choose the relevant distribution .",
    "the open system consists of only one component , but the dimension of the open system space is infinite .",
    "so , we choose as the relevant variables the free hamiltonian of the bath @xmath53 the free hamiltonian of the oscillator @xmath54 and , also , the annihilation and creation operators @xmath55 . the relevant distribution can be written as @xmath56\\exp[-\\beta h_b].\\ ] ] in the above equation @xmath57=\\exp[f_2(t)+f_1(t)f_3(t)/f_2(t)]/(\\exp[f_2(t)]-1)$ ] and @xmath58,$ ] @xmath30 is the inverse thermodynamical temperature of the bath .",
    "the self - consistency conditions can be easily solved and the result is @xmath59 now an explicit formula for the entropy in terms of the mean values of the relevant variables can be derived @xmath60 where , @xmath61 is the equilibrium entropy of the bath .",
    "this fundamental result arises automatically as a part of the formalism .",
    "such a simple connection of dynamics and thermodynamics is a significant feature of the considered method .",
    "in fact , eq .   is a generalization of the informational entropy to the non - markovian and non - equilibrium cases for the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the knowledge of the thermodynamical entropy allows to determine other thermodynamical parameters . for instance",
    ", the non - equilibrium inverse temperature is @xmath62 by definition @xcite .",
    "one can check that for the system under consideration @xmath63 .",
    "the form of the above expression for the non - equilibrium entropy does not depend on details of the dynamical evolution . to apply this expression",
    "it is necessary to determine the non - equilibrium average of the relevant variables .",
    "the dynamics of the relevant observables is governed by eq .  .",
    "for the considered model , up to terms of the second order in the coupling constant , we obtain @xmath64 \\langle a^\\dagger\\ ! a \\rangle^{t}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[f(t,\\beta)+f^*(t,\\beta)-f(t)-f^*(t)\\right ] \\label{osc_trans1}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations we introduced the following correlation functions @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the spectral density of the bath .",
    "eqs .   and",
    "seem identical to equations derived with the help of the traditional tcl master equation @xcite for the model .",
    "nevertheless , the solution of eqs .   and completely determines the non - equilibrium dynamics to second order in the coupling constant as opposed to the traditional approach , where for the model one has to solve an infinite system of the dynamical equations . to clarify the difference",
    "let us determine the correlation function @xmath67}^2+\\langle n\\rangle^t-[\\langle a\\rangle^t\\langle a^\\dagger\\rangle^t]^2.$ ] clearly , to find this correlation function from the traditional master equation one has to find a dynamical equation for the function and resolve it .",
    "the solution of eqs .  - can be written as @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72where @xmath73 is the free term in eq .  .",
    "now , choosing the spectral density as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the cutoff frequency , and substituting the solution of the equations and in we find the non - equilibrium entropy .",
    "moreover , the inverse temperature is @xmath76 thus , we described the thermodynamical properties of the open system in addition to the dynamical properties .",
    "the typical evolution of the thermodynamical entropy and the inverse temperature is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the markovian evolution corresponds to the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the system relaxes from the initial state @xmath79 and @xmath80 it is clearly seen that the thermodynamical parameters go to the equilibrium value , and the equilibrium temperature is equal to the temperature of the bath . in the non - markovian case",
    "the thermodynamical parameters reach equilibrium faster and oscillate around the equilibrium value .    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the second example which we consider is a damped driven two - level system .",

    "thus , the non - equilibrium entropy of the system has the form @xmath92    the expression for the thermodynamical entropy is valid for the non - markovian and the non - equilibrium cases .",

    "the dynamical equations - are identical to the usual result derived with the help of the tcl master equation @xcite . for this model",
    "the two approaches give the same results .",
    "this is due to the fact that we considered all possible dynamical variables of the open system as relevant .",
