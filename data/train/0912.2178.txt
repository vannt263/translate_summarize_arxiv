    "the existence of a globally unique entropy as a function of thermodynamic state , which is non - decreasing in time , is one of the central tenets of classical phenomenological thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the meaning of entropy within the context of statistical mechanics seems to defy consensus(see @xcite for examples ) . since the start of statistical mechanics there has been concern that the existence of fluctuation phenomena leads to violations of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this may lead to decreases in entropy , the existence of perpetual motion machines or maybe even the inability to define an entropy at all .",
    "maxwell s demon represents a persistent strand of thought experiments dedicated to exploring these possibilities@xcite .",
    "most attempts to construct a second law of thermodynamics for statistical mechanics involve one of two strategies : restrict the domain of validity of the classical statement ( usually to reliable , continuous processes ) so as to exclude fluctuation phenomena ; or to attempt to derive a new second law within the domain of statistical mechanics . here",
    "we investigate the possibility of a third approach : to extend the domain of the phenomenological second law to include , constrain , and predict the extent of the fluctuation phenomena , which reduces to the more familiar version if fluctuation phenomena are absent .",
    "we find that such an extension seems , in principle , possible , and that with additional work it is possible to define an entropy function consistent with this .",
    "some possible relationships of this fluctuation second law to conventional statistical mechanics can be inferred .",
    "the approach of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly reviews the equivalence of the kelvin , clausius and carnot versions of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "section 3 then proposes an extension of the kelvin version , to incorporate fluctuation phenomena .",
    "logically equivalent generalisations of the clausius and carnot versions are deduced , and some constraints are deduced about the form of the extended second law .",
    "section 4 reviews the derivation of an entropy function and shows when the existence of a fluctuation entropy function can be deduced .",
    "finally section 5 considers some relationships to statistical mechanical entropies , including the gibbs and tsallis@xcite entropies .",
    "textbook versions of the second law of thermodynamics ( see , for example , @xcite ) , when expressed in terms of heat flows and heat baths , take forms such as :    * * kelvin * : no process is possible whose sole result is the extraction of heat from a heat bath and its conversion to work . * * clausius * : no process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from one heat bath to another heat bath at a higher temperature . * * carnot heat engine * : no heat engine operating between heat baths at temperatures @xmath0 can operate at an efficiency @xmath1 exceeding the efficiency of a reversible heat engine : @xmath2 * * carnot heat pump * : no heat pump operating between heat baths at temperatures @xmath0 can operate at an efficiency @xmath3 exceeding the efficiency of a reversible heat pump : @xmath4    demonstration of the logical equivalence of each pair of these statements can easily be found in a textbook such as @xcite .",
    "the equivalence is typically proven by the means of diagrams such as in figure [ fg : carnotequiv ] .",
    "this diagram shows the combination of heat engine and heat pumps being used to attempt violations of the kelvin and clausius statements .",
    "figure [ fg : vpumpkelv ] shows that if a heat pump can operate with efficiency @xmath5 , then in combination with a reversible heat engine operating at @xmath6 there is a net conversion of @xmath7 heat from the lower temperature heat bath into work , violating the kelvin statement .",
    "similarly figure [ fg : vengclaus ] shows a heat engine operating with efficiency @xmath8 can be combined with a reversible heat pump operating at @xmath9 could transfer heat@xmath10 from a colder to hotter heat bath without requiring work , thus violating the clausius statement .",
    "it should be noted that this demonstration requires a number of usually unstated assumptions , such as the absence of negative temperatures . in particular , the equivalence requires it to be physically possible to construct a reversible heat engine or pump .",
    "for example , if it were not physically possible to build a heat engine whose efficiency could reach that of a theoretical reversible heat engine , then it would not necessarily follow that a real heat pump exceeding the carnot efficiency could violate the kelvin or clausius versions of the second law . all that could be implied",
    "would be that the efficiency of real heat pumps were bounded by @xmath11 but @xmath12 .",
    "note that such a heat pump , with @xmath13 , would not be possible to operate reversibly as a heat engine . ] .",
    "the problem arises that fluctuation phenomena , such as brownian motion , do , in principle , violate all these statements of the second law , when probabilistic processes are allowed .",
    "attempts to define a modified second law will typically restrict the domain of validity .",
    "it may be suggested that the second law only applies to the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of atoms , where fluctuations become negligible , or it may be suggested that the second law only applies to continuous or reliable processes :    * no _ reliable _ process is possible whose sole result is the extraction of heat from a heat bath and its conversion to work . * no process is possible _ with probability one _ , whose sole result is the extraction of heat from a heat bath and its conversion to work .",
    "* no _ continuously operating _",
    "process is possible whose sole result is the extraction of heat from a heat bath and its conversion to work . *",
    "no process is possible whose sole result is , _ on average _ , the extraction of heat from a heat bath and its conversion to work .    restricting the domain of validity in this way",
    ", however , proves unable to provide answers to many interesting questions about the thermodynamic consequences of fluctuation phenomena .",
    "can systems with a finite number of atoms be used to continuously , reliably convert heat to work ? if a process can succeed with probability less than one , how much work can be extracted ? if a process only operates for a finite amount of time how much work can be extracted ?",
    "can it be arbitrarily large ?",
    "can a process exist which can extract an arbitrarily large quantity of work with probability arbitrarily close to one , while still failing on average due to catastrophic failure when it does fail ?",
    "this can be illustrated by considering a hypothetical family of processes , parameterised by @xmath14 .",
    "process @xmath15 will , with probability @xmath16 , generates @xmath15 units of work from heat , but with probability @xmath17 it requires @xmath18 units of work to be dissipated .",
    "the mean work produced is @xmath19 , regardless of the value of @xmath15 , but as @xmath20 arbitrarily large amounts of work are produced with probability arbitrarily close to one .",
    "even more extreme examples can easily be constructed .",
    "such a family of processes satisfies several of the restricted laws above , but does not accord with our experience of fluctuation phenomena .",
    "in this section the main argument of the paper will be explored . rather than follow the path of the modifications in section [ s :",
    "phenom ] , restricting the domain of validity of the second law so as to exclude fluctuation phenomena , it will instead be expanded to include fluctuation phenomena .",
    "fluctuations will be treated as being probabilistic processes , occurring with probability less than one .",
    "the modified law should set a constraint upon the size of fluctuations that can occur , and should reduce to the fluctuation - free second law when only deterministic processes occur .",
    "the proposed modification to the phenomenological second law is based upon nothing more than the observation that the greater the size of the fluctuation , the less probable its occurrence . from this",

    "the next stage is to consider combining fluctuations , by diagrams involving more than one fluctuation . as it turns out ,",

    "we have further shown that the deduction of the existence of a non - decreasing thermodynamic entropy function of state may still be followed , to derive a fluctuation entropy function of state . under a similar kind of circumstance for which the thermodynamic entropy can be deduced to be globally unique ,",
    "then the fluctuation entropy can be deduced to be globally unique .",
    "furthermore , if the thermodynamic and fluctuation entropies are both globally unique , then they are necessarily identical ( up to an additive constant ) .",
    "this holds out hope that more rigorously axiomatic developments of the thermodynamic entropy , such as that of lieb and yngvason@xcite , may be generalized in a similar manner to incorporate fluctuation phenomena .",
    "some possible forms of the entropy fluctuation law have been investigated .",
    "the exponential form naturally produces the gibbs canonical distribution for thermal fluctuations .",
    "non - extensive entropies , such as the tsallis entropy , can also be seen to arise naturally in this approach .",
    "further investigation is needed to explore the consistency of different @xmath26 functions .",
    "in particular , the requirement that the _ mean _ heat extracted over a cycle is non - positive , @xmath227 , may be expected to further constrain which functions are admissible .",
    "suppose there exists a path dependant quantity , @xmath228 ( a property of a particular path @xmath110 , in a state space , from state @xmath127 to state @xmath128 ) well defined for all paths @xmath110 , states @xmath127 and states @xmath128 , for which : @xmath229 and that there exists at least one path from each @xmath127 to each @xmath128 for which the corresponding value of @xmath230 is finite , so that @xmath231 < \\infty$ ] .",

    "note that as @xmath244 : @xmath245 and @xmath246          it is now a trivial matter to show from equation [ appbigeq ] that , whenever the equality in equation [ appclaus ] can be reached , that all functions in the set @xmath253 ( indeed , all functions satisfying equation [ appent ] ) will give the same entropy difference between states @xmath127 and @xmath128 . by extension ,",
