    "perovskite - structure oxides exhibit various types of lattice instabilities resulting from inherent structural frustration in the prototype cubic structure @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "this class of materials includes a large number of ferroelectrics , with uniform polar distortions and accompanying lattice relaxation ( eg .",
    "@xmath6 ) , while cation substitution can result in dramatic changes in ground state distortion ( eg .",
    "antiferroelectric in @xmath7 , antiferrodistortive in @xmath8 ) and corresponding complexities in the mixed systems ( eg . @xmath9 )",
    ". however , in nearly all examples , the amplitudes and energies of the distortions are rather small , and cubic symmetry is restored at temperatures above a critical temperature @xmath10 , typically a few hundred degrees kelvin .    for a better understanding of structural phase transitions in perovskite oxides , including chemical trends in the transition temperatures , the first - order vs second - order character of transitions , the relationship between local distortions and average crystallographic structure , and the stability of intermediate temperature phases , first - principles calculations offer valuable access to microscopic information .",
    "with advances in algorithms and computational capabilities , the challenge of achieving the high accuracy necessary for studying these distortions has been largely met , and ground state distortions well reproduced for a wide range of perovskite - structure oxides@xcite . however , for ab initio molecular dynamics or monte carlo , the system sizes required for the study of finite - temperature structural transitions are still completely impractical .",
    "an alternative approach is to focus on a restricted subset of the degrees of freedom that is relevant to the transition and construct a simple effective hamiltonian in this subspace .",
    "the parameters in these models are chosen to reproduce the low energy surface of an individual material , and thus to reproduce its finite temperature behaviour in the vicinity of its transition .",
    "comparison of these models gives a systematic understanding of similarities and differences in the microscopic structural energetics of different materials . from the dependence of calculated properties on effective hamiltonian parameters",
    ", one can also obtain a better understanding of the role of various microscopic couplings in producing the observed behaviour .",
    "microscopic effective hamiltonians for structural transitions in perovskites were first constructed using the concept of local modes , with empirically determined parameters.@xcite first - principles total energy calculations were used in the determination of a local mode effective hamiltonian for the structural transition in @xmath11@xcite and more recently for the structural transitions in @xmath0@xcite , @xmath1@xcite and @xmath8@xcite . a systematic approach which generalizes and refines the local mode concept , allowing the efficient construction of an optimal effective hamiltonian from first - principles total - energy and linear response techniques ,",
    "has been developed based on the concept of lattice wannier functions.@xcite this approach exploits symmetry properties of the system and is generally applicable to complex structural transitions involving several unstable modes including ones at the zone boundary .",
    "information from additional first principles calculations allows for a systematic check on the validity of the truncation of the effective hamiltonian , and , when needed , the expansion of the subspace and refinements of its form .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is quantitatively realistic while retaining a simple and physically transparent form .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed description of the first - principles investigation of @xmath0@xcite , which exhibits a single first - order transition at 763 k from the cubic high - temperature phase to the ferroelectric tetragonal ground state , shown in fig .",
    "we construct an effective hamiltonian for this structural phase transition from first principles using the lattice wannier function method .",
    "in contrast with @xmath1@xcite and @xmath2@xcite for which the uniform polar distortions in the low temperature phase consist of predominantly b - atom displacements , those in @xmath0 are dominated by a - atom ( @xmath3 ) displacements , which will be important in determining the effective hamiltonian subspace .",
    "the effective hamiltonian also contains the coupling of these local polar distortions to strain . in ref .",
    ", the tetragonal phase in @xmath0 was found to be stabilized relative to the rhombohedral phase by the unit cell relaxation .",
    "in addition , we will find that strain plays a crucial role in producing the correct finite temperature transition behaviour .    in section iia ,",
    "we briefly review the method of lattice wannier functions . in section iib and iic , the first principles methods and results obtained for the lattice constant , elastic constants , phonon frequencies and the effective charges of @xmath0 are presented . in sections",
    "iiia and iiib , we describe the construction of the effective hamiltonian , with particular attention to the treatment of lo - to splitting and crossing of branches through explicit parameterization of the lattice wannier functions . in section iiic",
    ", we describe properties of the ground state of the effective hamiltonian determined from first principles . in section iv",
    ", we present results of finite temperature analysis of @xmath12 using mean field theory and monte carlo simulations .",
    "these results are discussed in section v.",
    "in the lattice wannier function method , the effective hamiltonian is obtained as the result of projection of the full lattice hamiltonian ( in the born - oppenheimer approximation ) into a subspace of the full ionic displacement space .",
    "the effective hamiltonian subspace is spanned by an orthonormal basis of `` lattice wannier functions : '' symmetrized localized atomic displacement patterns taken with respect to a high - symmetry reference configuration .",
    "this basis defines a set of coordinates such that a given set of values of the coordinates corresponds directly to a particular pattern of atomic displacements . as a result of the symmetrized and localized nature of the basis",
    ", the taylor expansion of the effective hamiltonian around the high - symmetry reference configuration ( with all coordinate values equal to zero ) has a simple form with relatively few parameters , which can be determined from first principles calculations using the correspondence to patterns of atomic displacements .",
    "we briefly review the procedure ; further details can be found in ref . .",
    "construction of the subspace begins with a taylor expansion of the full lattice hamiltonian to quadratic order .",
    "a subset of the eigenvectors of the quadratic hamiltonian is selected for inclusion in the subspace .",
    "this subset must include the unstable modes which freeze in to produce the low - temperature structure .",
    "in addition , to achieve a good description of the branches which emanate from the unstable modes ,  end - points \" of these branches at high symmetry k - points are included .",
    "the symmetry properties of the subspace are established by identifying symmetries of localized functions ( wyckoff position and site symmetry group irrep ) which can build up the selected subset of modes .",
    "we follow the prescription in ref . to obtain an explicit , though approximate , form of a lattice wannier basis vector .",
    "this involves finding the symmetric coordination shells surrounding a representative wyckoff site and identifying the independent displacement patterns of each shell that transform according to the given irreducible representation of the site symmetry group .",
    "the amplitudes of these displacement patterns completely specify an lwf .",
    "because of the localized nature of lwfs , this infinite number of parameters can , to a good approximation , be reduced to a small finite number by neglecting the displacements of shells beyond a chosen range . at high symmetry points in the bz , the modes built up with these parametrized lwfs",
    "are then fit to the corresponding normalized mode eigenvectors obtained from first principles .",
    "these basis functions completely specify the effective hamiltonian subspace . in the ideal case ,",
    "this subspace is completely decoupled at quadratic order from its complementary subspace and to a good approximation at higher order as well .",
    "this happens when the subspace consists of entire branches isolated in energy from the others and contains all the unstable modes . in most real systems , branches emanating from the unstable modes cross with branches in the complementary subspace",
    "this leads to some degree of quadratic coupling which is unimportant if the crossing occurs far away from the unstable modes . if not",
    ", the subspace should be expanded to include these branches .",
    "in addition , in polar crystals , the electric field at @xmath13 can mix the lo modes differently from the corresponding to modes .",
    "in such a case , the wannier basis vector which reproduces a given to branch will not reproduce any lo mode exactly .",
    "however , since lo modes are typically high in energy , this approximate description of the lo mode should be adequate for the description of the structural transition .",
    "the quadratic part of the lattice hamiltonian has both kinetic and potential energy contributions .",
    "however , in the classical statistical mechanical treatment , the kinetic energy terms appear in gaussian integrals in the partition function , factoring out to give a trivial contribution to the free energy . in this case , the eigenmodes used in the construction above could be of either the force constant matrix or the dynamical matrix . in @xmath0 , we have found that the difference in the resulting effective hamiltonian subspace is rather small and both choices should give comparable results . in the construction described in section iii , we have used the eigenmodes of the force constant matrix .",
    "eigenmodes of the dynamical matrix are strongly preferable only if the effective hamiltonian is also to be used in classical dynamics or quantum mechanical simulations , since in that case the form of the kinetic energy is greatly simplified .    in the final step ,",
    "the lattice hamiltonian is projected into this subspace to obtain the effective hamiltonian .",
    "an explicit form @xmath12 is obtained by identifying a small number of physically important terms in a taylor expansion in the lattice wannier coordinates .",
    "the coefficients of these terms are parameters to be determined from first principles by fitting @xmath12 to the results of selected total energy and linear response calculations , using the explicit correspondence between the wannier coordinates and the actual ionic displacements . to check the validity of the truncated form of the effective hamiltonian , additional independent first principles calculations can be performed and compared with @xmath12 .      the first - principles calculations for @xmath0 were performed using the ab initio pseudopotential method in the local density approximation ( lda ) with the perdew - zunger parametrization of the ceperley - alder density functional.@xcite for pb , the scalar - relativistic pseudopotentials from ref",
    "were used .",
    "the use of a plane wave basis set dictates the use of optimized pseudopotentials@xcite for o and ti to achieve reasonable energy convergence and transferability . for o ,",
    "the reference configuration @xmath14 was used with pseudopotential core radii @xmath15 optimization was performed with @xmath16 and @xmath17 and 4 and 3 bessel functions for s and p orbitals respectively . for ti ,",
    "it is essential to treat the semi - core @xmath18 and @xmath19 electrons as valence electrons@xcite .",
    "the reference configuration @xmath20 was used with pseudopotential core radii @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "optimization was performed with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and 4 bessel functions .",
    "an energy cutoff of @xmath26 ev ( corresponding to approximately 3600 plane waves for a 5-atom unit cell ) was used to ensure convergence within @xmath27/atom .",
    "the self - consistent total energy calculations were performed using the program castep 2.1@xcite based on the stable and efficient preconditioned conjugate - gradients method @xcite . for the brillouin zone integrations ,",
    "k - point sampling was performed using the monkhorst - pack construction@xcite with 64 k - points in the full brillouin zone .",
    "as reported in ref . and summarized here in table ( i ) , the lattice constant and elastic constants of @xmath0 in the cubic perovskite structure obtained from the total energy calculations for a range of unit cell volumes are in good agreement with previous calculations@xcite .",
    "in addition , in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "we showed the calculated energies as a function of experimental soft mode amplitude , which compare favorably with previous lapw calculations@xcite .",
    "the technique of dft linear response is used to calculate the second derivatives of the total energy with respect to perturbation parameters through the self consistent calculation of the first order correction to the occupied kohn - sham wave functions@xcite .",
    "for example , born effective charges , dielectric constant and dynamical matrices are the second derivatives of total energies and thus can be obtained with this technique . in this framework , the dielectric constant can be calculated avoiding cumbersome sums over unoccupied bands .",
    "another significant advantage is that @xmath28 force constants can be computed with an effort similar to that of a single unit cell total energy calculation .",
    "our implementation is a modification of castep 2.1 based on the variational formulation of dft linear response@xcite .",
    "all the linear response calculations reported here were done at the experimental lattice constant @xcite of @xmath29 with 64 monkhorst - pack k - points in the full brillouin zone .",
    "the vosko - wilk - nusair parametrization of the ceperly - alder density functional was used to permit the calculation of derivatives of exchange - correlation terms@xcite .",
    "a @xmath30 fourier transform grid is used for integration over a unit cell in real space .",
    "this real space grid breaks global translational invariance@xcite , which manifests itself as small violations of the acoustic sum rule ( the calculated frequencies of zone center acoustic modes are not exactly zero ) and charge neutrality ( the calculated change in polarization due to a rigid displacement of the crystal in any direction is not exactly zero ) .",
    "the acoustic sum rule was imposed by adding small corrections to the diagonal elements of the @xmath31 force constant matrix .",
    "charge neutrality was imposed by adding the same small correction to the effective charges of all atoms .",
    "the born effective charges are presented in table ( ii ) in very good agreement with previously calculated values@xcite .",
    "the main features of interest are the anomalously large effective charges of ti and o along the bond and the anisotropy of the oxygen charge .",
    "the calculated dielectric constant is 8.24 , which can be compared with the experimental value of 8.64 quoted in ref . .",
    "the data in table ( ii ) combined with the calculated force constants at @xmath31 give the frequencies of ir - active phonons presented in table ( iii ) .",
    "direct comparison of these results with the previous calculations@xcite is not possible because the calculations were performed at different lattice constants .",
    "this has an especially large impact on the unstable mode frequency , as confirmed by our calculations of coupling between this mode and homogeneous strain , to be described below .",
    "as can be seen in table ( iv ) , the unstable @xmath32 mode has the largest mode effective charge , which should be associated with the largest lo - to splitting .",
    "since there are three polar zone center modes with the same symmetry , mixing leads to lo - mode eigenvectors different from to - mode eigenvectors .",
    "effects of this mixing can be quantified using the correlation matrix@xcite @xmath33 given in table ( iv ) , where @xmath34 is the mass matrix and @xmath35 are the ir - active mode eigenvectors . as expected , the unstable @xmath32 to mode has the strongest correlation with the highest lo mode .    in table",
    "v , we report selected phonon frequencies at other high symmetry k - points in the brillouin zone , focusing in particular on the lowest energy phonons . while we also find unstable modes away from the @xmath36 point , the unstable mode at @xmath36 is clearly the dominant lattice instability in our calculations , consistent with the observed low - temperature structure .",
    "the eigenvectors of the lowest energy phonons and the corresponding force constant matrices will be used in the determination of the parameters in the effective hamiltonian in the next section .",
    "the construction of the effective hamiltonian subspace begins with consideration of the calculated force constant matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors at @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the subspace has to include the unstable polar @xmath32 mode which freezes in to produce the low temperature tetragonal structure .",
    "in addition , to achieve a good description of branches which emanate from this dominant unstable mode , the endpoints of these branches @xmath40 are included . as can be seen from table ( i ) of ref . , the lattice wannier functions which can build up this subset of modes transform like 3-dimensional vectors centered at pb - sites .",
    "it should be noted that the lowest mode at r is actually @xmath41 , which corresponds to an oxygen octahedron rotation instability seen in many perovskite oxides@xcite . since crossing of the lowest branch along ( 111 ) with that emanating from @xmath41 occurs far from the relevant mode @xmath32 and relatively higher in energy , we do not include it in the subspace .    to include coupling of the relevant polar distortions ( @xmath32 ) to local distortions of the unit cell ( inhomogeneous strain ) , we expand the subspace to include the acoustic modes by choosing an additional set of lattice wannier functions . of the three possibilities ( listed in table ( i ) of ref . ) , ti - centered 3-dimensional vectors are preferable to @xmath42 ( 1-dimensional vectors ) and @xmath43 ( 2-dimensional vectors ) , since this choice corresponds to the smallest subspace expansion and highest site symmetry group .",
    "furthermore , unlike @xmath42 , the resulting @xmath44 dimensional subspace does not include the highest energy modes .",
    "next , we obtain an explicit form for the pb - centered lwf .",
    "this involves finding the symmetric coordination shells surrounding a pb site and identifying the independent displacement patterns of each shell that transform according to the vector representation of the site symmetry group @xmath45 . for a given shell",
    "there can be more than one pattern of displacements with a given transformation property .",
    "to each such pattern corresponds an independent amplitude parameter . by neglecting the displacements of shells beyond 1st neighbour ti and o shells and 2nd neighbour pb shells ,",
    "we obtain a total of 10 parameters .",
    "the first shell of ti atoms has 2 independent displacement patterns , parametrized by @xmath46 and @xmath47 ; there are 1 , 2 , 2 parameters for the zeroth , first and second shells of pb atoms respectively and 3 parameters for the first shell of oxygen atoms .",
    "these displacement patterns are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    to determine the numerical values of these parameters for @xmath0",
    ", we build up the transverse modes @xmath48 at high symmetry k - points in the brillouin zone , namely @xmath36 , x , m , and r , from the parametrized lwf using @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a direct lattice vector and @xmath51 is an lwf centered at the pb site in the _",
    "i_th unit cell , @xmath52 being its cartesian component .",
    "this specifies atomic displacements in these modes as linear functions of the parameters , to be fit to the normalized eigenvectors of the force constant matrix calculated from first principles . with the parameters listed above",
    ", we can reproduce the normalized eigenvectors of the modes @xmath32 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 exactly .",
    "the remaining free parameters , associated with pb and ti displacements , were used to fit to a normalized mode with maximum overlap with the lowest @xmath55 ( see table ( vi ) ) .",
    "numerical values of these parameters , listed in table ( vii ) , clearly show that the magnitude of the parameters decays rapidly with shell - radius , confirming the assumption of lwf localization .",
    "furthermore , by adding an additional shell of pb ( one parameter ) and oxygen atoms ( two parameters ) , we can reproduce all the transverse optical modes in the subspace .",
    "the parameter values for this refined lwf are given in table ( vii ) .",
    "the values of the parameters of the innermost shells do not change very much , and the values of the new parameters are very small .",
    "another way of testing the approximate lwf is to see how well it reproduces other modes in the subspace .",
    "for example , in table viii , we show the comparison of the first principles @xmath56 eigenvector with the mode constructed with the approximate lwf .",
    "the approximate mode has an overlap of @xmath57 with the relevant mode , and if the approximate mode vector is normalized , the overlap becomes @xmath58 , showing that the lwf describes the subspace very well .    for the simplest treatment of inhomogeneous strain ( the acoustic branches ) , an explicit expression of the ti - centered lwf",
    "is not needed , since the goal is only to reproduce the long wavelength acoustic modes , whose dispersion is determined from the elastic constants . for a more refined treatment",
    ", an lwf could be parametrized as above and determined by fitting to the first principles eigenmodes @xmath32 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath55 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .      using the symmetry properties of the lattice wannier basis for the effective hamiltonian subspace , we write an explicit expression for @xmath12 as a taylor expansion in the lattice wannier coordinates , invariant under the space group @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the pb - centered and ti - centered lattice wannier coordinates respectively .",

    "the difference among the energies of uniform distortions with different symmetries ( ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , ( 111 ) ) is a reflection of the cubic anisotropy , which is described quite well by the fourth order terms .",
    "the resulting parameters are listed in table ( x ) .    to account for the effects of changes in lattice parameters at the structural phase transition",
    ", we include the lowest order terms in the homogeneous strain and its coupling to the pb - centered subspace : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a component of the strain tensor , @xmath88 are the elastic constants , and the parameters @xmath89 give the strength of coupling of strain with the local polar distortions @xmath90 .",
    "all these parameters are determined from the single unit cell total - energy calculations for three independent types of unit cell distortions ( isotropic , uniaxial and rhombohedral shear ) , with magnitudes of up to 2 to 4 @xmath91 of the experimental lattice constants .",

    ", there is no need to include higher - order interactions . in any case , within the local anharmonicity approximation , global translational invariance requires anharmonic terms to be zero at all orders .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , there is no need for an explicit form of the ti - centered lwf in this minimal treatment .",
    "for refinement of @xmath12 in this subspace , one could construct an explicit form and determine additional parameters in a manner analogous to that for the pb - centered subspace .",
    "finally , the simplest coupling between local polar distortions ( pb - centered subspace ) and inhomogeneous strain ( ti - centered subspace ) that satisfies the constraint of global translational invariance and does not vanish in the limit @xmath109 is the nearest - neighbor coupling linear in @xmath110 and quadratic in @xmath85 , with both @xmath85 variables taken on the same site : @xmath111 @xmath112 couples only to differences of the @xmath113 s , which can be recognized as finite difference approximations to the gradient , and thus as the local strain tensor ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the terms in @xmath12 coupling inhomogeneous strain and polar distortions are related in the long wavelength limit to the coupling between homogeneous strain and the polar @xmath32 mode .",
    "thus the three independent coupling parameters can be obtained from the corresponding homogeneous strain coupling parameters : @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "having fully determined @xmath12 , we now explore the low energy surface of the model to confirm that it gives a correct ground state when compared with the real crystal .",
    "since the anharmonic terms occur only in the pb - subspace and are local ( the anharmonicity is wavevector independent ) , it is easy to determine the ground state from the quadratic order terms .",
    "the lowest energy mode is obtained by freezing in the most unstable mode : @xmath32 .",
    "we consider changes in energy as this mode is frozen in with polarization along the @xmath116 and @xmath117 directions . in fig .",
    "4 , it can be seen that the rhombohedral state ( @xmath117-distortion ) has the lowest energy .",
    "if the unit cell is allowed to relax as the mode is frozen in , by minimizing over the homogeneous strain , we find an overall increase in distortion energy , with the lowest energy state being of tetragonal symmetry ( @xmath118-distortion ) as can be seen in fig .",
    "6 . this is consistent both with previous first principles calculations@xcite and experimental results@xcite .    for the lowest energy tetragonal configuration",
    ", we obtain a value for the spontaneous polarization from the mode effective charge of @xmath119 , which is in the range of values @xmath120 to @xmath121 reported from experiments@xcite . from the values of homogeneous strain in this ground state",
    ", we obtain a c / a ratio of 1.08 , to be compared with the experimental value of 1.061@xcite . using the explicit form for the lwf",
    ", the atomic displacements in the model ground state can be obtained .",
    "we find that the oxygen octahedra are almost undistorted and the relative displacement of the pb atoms is 0.35 (to be compared with the experimental value of 0.47 @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that this is not the true lda ground state , since previous total energy calculations@xcite for the experimental distortions showed the latter is slightly lower in energy .",
    "this means that there is a higher order coupling of the unstable @xmath32 mode to an additional polar @xmath32 mode not included in the effective hamiltonian subspace .",
    "considering that the atomic displacements in @xmath0 are relatively large , the presence of such anharmonicity is not surprising .",
    "however , as discussed above , the ground state of the model is very similar to the experimental ground state and the small loss of accuracy is more than compensated for by the gain in simplicity .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is constructed to show the same finite temperature critical behaviour as the full lattice hamiltonian in a statistical mechanical analysis . while the form of @xmath12 is somewhat too complicated for the application of analytical methods beyond mean field theory , it is quite suitable for monte carlo simulations , since the changes in energy for changing system configurations can be readily evaluated .",
    "monte carlo simulations are used in the detailed analysis of @xmath12 to obtain t - dependence of a variety of structural properties near the transition , while our mean field theory analysis is limited to the estimation of @xmath10 and the identification of the order of the transition and symmetry of the phases .",
    "comparison of the mean field results with those of monte carlo simulations allows us to study the effects of fluctuations .",
    "variational mean field theory for the class of models with variable length vector degrees of freedom and strain coupling was developed in ref . .",
    "in this approach , the homogeneous strain and uniform polarization ( @xmath122 ) are identified as the order parameters for the transition .",
    "@xmath122 is directly related to the average value of uniform local distortion through the mode effective charge @xmath123 and the unit cell volume @xmath124 ,    @xmath125    in the high temperature ( cubic perovskite ) phase , the uniform polarization is zero and the strain tensor has full cubic symmetry : @xmath126 .",
    "we used the variational formulation of mean field theory , which involves constructing a trial density matrix as a product of single site density matrices and minimizing the resulting free energy functional with respect to the variational parameters in the trial density matrix .",
    "we minimized the trial free energy with respect to variational parameters corresponding to cubic , tetragonal and rhombohedral symmetries to determine the stable phase at various temperatures .",
    "the system is stable in the cubic phase above the transition temperature @xmath127 and in the tetragonal phase below @xmath10 , but within the accuracy of our calculation , the transition is second order . switching off the coupling to homogeneous strain",
    "resulted in a second order cubic - rhombohedral transition at a significantly lower temperature of 900 k.      classical monte carlo simulations@xcite were performed using the metropolis algorithm for finite size systems of @xmath128 unit cells and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a configuration of the system is specified by two sets of three dimensional vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 placed on interpenetrating simple cubic lattices of size @xmath128 .",
    "we generated a trial configuration by updating a single vector to a randomly chosen vector inside a cubic box centered at the current value of the vector .",
    "the size of this box is chosen to yield a reasonable acceptance ratio @xmath129 , and is roughly @xmath130 near @xmath10 . with the change in a single vector , the change in energy associated with short range terms ( quadratic interactions up to third neighbour",
    ", the onsite potential , coupling to strain and third order coupling between the two subspaces ) is easy to calculate . because of their long range , computation of dipolar intersite interactions is relatively costly , limiting the size of our simulations to @xmath131 .",
    "the @xmath132 matrix of dipolar intersite coupling for each pair of spins was calculated using the ewald summation technique for each value of l. changes in the quadratic intersite interaction due to changes in strain are neglected in this model .",
    "one monte carlo sweep ( mcs ) involves one update of the @xmath133 s ( in typewriter mode ) followed by one update of the @xmath134 s ( in typewriter mode ) , and 20 updates of the 6 components of the strain tensor .",
    "preliminary monte carlo simulations performed with 25,000 to 50,000 sweeps showed dependence on the initial configuration of simulations at temperatures in the vicinity of the transition for @xmath135 . for @xmath136 , which is small enough for ergodic sampling in a run of this length ,",
    "the energy histogram shows two clearly separated peaks .",
    "this behaviour is typical of a first order transition@xcite . at larger system sizes , due to the exponentially increasing free energy barrier between the regions of configuration space corresponding to low and high temperature phases ,",
    "only one of the two peaks in the energy histogram is sampled , depending on the choice of initial configuration .",
    "an accurate determination of @xmath10 requires knowledge of the relative free energies of the high and low temperature phases as a function of temperature .",
    "recently developed methods to extract @xmath10 for first order transitions include multicanonical algorithms@xcite and jump - walking algorithms@xcite . in our applications of these methods to @xmath0 , we found that these approaches require very long ( @xmath137 mcs ) simulations , and therefore are rather impractical .",
    "however in the present case , the uncertainty in @xmath10 obtained from the range of hysteresis is small compared to the lda and other errors in our analysis and therefore high accuracy determination of @xmath10 is not necessary .",
    "the calculation of the physical properties of the high and low temperature phases at temperatures inside the range of hysteresis is carried out with an appropriate choice of the initial configuration .    in fig .",
    "7 , we show the bounds on @xmath10 for @xmath138 through @xmath139 , obtained by monitoring the sensitivity of the average structural parameters to the choice of initial state : @xmath140 is the lowest temperature at which the system averages are characteristic of the cubic state , starting with an inital ground state tetragonal configuration , while @xmath141 is the highest temperature at which a starting cubic configuration results in a tetragonal state .",
    "a value of @xmath142 , obtained from averaging the bounds at the largest system size , is in very good agreement with the experimental transition temperature 763k .    to detect the symmetry of the low temperature phase",
    ", we calculated the averages of largest , smallest and intermediate absolute values of the cartesian components of @xmath143 .",
    "these averages for the @xmath144 system as a function of temperature are shown in fig .",
    "near @xmath10 , the largest component jumps to a finite value , while the other two components remain close to zero , indicating tetragonal symmetry of the low temperature phase . as shown in fig .",
    "9 , this uniform tetragonal polar distortion is accompanied by a tetragonal strain @xmath145 .",
    "this quantity also shows a marked jump near @xmath10 . finally , from the average homogeneous strain we obtained the average volume of the system as a function of temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "10 . the negative thermal expansion in the simulations just below @xmath10 is also seen experimentally@xcite .    the latent heat of a first order transition is given by the difference in energies at which the two peaks appear in the energy histogram in the simulations at @xmath10",
    ". to determine this energy difference , we performed two simulations for @xmath146 at the midpoint of the hysteresis range @xmath147 , one starting with a tetragonal configuration and the other starting with a cubic configuration .",
    "the difference in the positions of the peaks in the energy histograms for these two simulations yields an estimate of latent heat of 3400 j / mol , in rough agreement with the measured value of 4800 j / mole@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these values are much larger than 209 j / mol latent heat of the cubic tetragonal transition of @xmath1@xcite .",
    "information about the local distortions in the high temperature nonpolar phase just above @xmath10 , can be obtained from the single spin distribution @xmath148 . for all @xmath149",
    ", we find the distribution to be very close to gaussian .",
    "the rather broad width ( @xmath150 ) shows that there are significant local distortions .    for the system sizes used in the simulations",
    ", the coupling to the inhomogeneous strain appears to be relatively unimportant . if the coupling is set to zero the changes in the calculated @xmath10 and other transition properties are negligible .",
    "however , for larger scale simulations involving multiple domains the effects should be significant .",
    "the first principles effective hamiltonian constructed in the previous section provides a quantitative microscopic description of the structural energetics of @xmath0 relevant to the paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "this model can be used to investigate the connection of specific features of the hamiltonian to the observed behaviour in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "in addition , it is possible to connect these features to aspects of the chemistry of @xmath0 and related compounds .",
    "one important feature of the hamiltonian is that the to branches are unstable throughout most of the bz ( fig .",
    "so , although @xmath32 is the dominant instability , finite wavelength fluctuations have relatively low energy . this may account for the breadth of the single site distribution , and can be expected also to be reflected in the short range order . the unstable branch along the @xmath117 direction in @xmath0 is quite flat when compared with @xmath8@xcite and @xmath2@xcite . in comparison with @xmath2 and ferroelectric @xmath1 , in which the polar unstable modes have a strong b - component@xcite , the instabilities in @xmath0 are dominated by large pb - displacements . from symmetry",
    "arguments@xcite , the pb displacements couple with oxygen displacements at @xmath151 and @xmath152 leading to the low energy of the modes at those points .",
    "while the same argument applies to ti displacements at @xmath153 and @xmath152 , they do not couple with any other mode at @xmath154 point .",
    "therefore , the energy of the mode at @xmath154 is high and the dispersion along @xmath36 to r is large .",
    "the special role @xmath3 plays in the instabilities of @xmath0 and @xmath7@xcite in contrast with the a - atoms in non-@xmath3 perovskite compounds has its origin in the strong hybridization of @xmath3 with oxygen atoms@xcite .    to understand the consequences of the coupling of the polar subspace to the strain at finite temperature",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations for @xmath12 with this coupling set to zero .",
    "this corresponds to a constant volume phase transition with the unit cell constrained to be cubic . in this case",
    ", we find a second order phase transition at @xmath155 k directly to the rhombohedral phase .",
    "thus , the coupling of local polar distortions to strain is responsible for both the stability of the tetragonal phase relative to the rhombohedral one and the first order character of the transition at finite temperature .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , mean field theory shows a second order transition both with and without strain coupling , implying that both fluctuations and strain coupling are required for producing the first order transition . comparing the transition temperatures obtained in monte carlo and mean field theory with and without strain coupling , we find that while fluctuations suppress @xmath10 , the coupling to strain enhances the stability of the ferroelectric phase .    in comparison with related ferroelectric compounds , the transition in @xmath0 has a much stronger first order character , reflected in its large latent heat . while the strain coupling is responsible for the first order character@xcite , anharmonicity in the lattice plays an important role in the magnitude of its discontinuity@xcite .",
    "the minimum energy uniform polar distortions in @xmath0 are much larger than those in related compounds indicating a large contribution from anharmonicity in the low - energy surface .",
    "the relation of these features to the chemistry of a or b atoms was discussed using ionic radii in ref . .",
    "there are two main sources of error in the work presented in this paper .",
    "one of these is the lda used in the exchange correlation functional .",
    "equilibrium lattice constants are typically underestimated in the lda calculations .",
    "this can strongly affect the study of structural phase transition , since the lattice instabilities are very sensitive to the lattice parameters .",
    "in the present work these errors were partially eliminated by expanding the effective hamiltonian around the experimental lattice constant near @xmath10 and dropping the term linear in strain .",
    "the other source of error is the truncation of the effective hamiltonian subspace . in the lwf approach , this subspace is decoupled at quadratic order from its complementary subspace to a good approximation .",
    "however there can be anharmonic coupling between the two subspaces . in the case of @xmath0 , there is a small higher order coupling of @xmath32 to modes not included in the subspace , which affects the energies of large distortions . since these large distortions are mainly important at low temperatures , we expect this coupling to have a small effect on @xmath10 .",
    "in conclusion , we have applied the method of lattice wannier functions to construct an effective hamiltonian for the ferroelectric phase transition in @xmath0 completely from first principles .",
    "monte carlo simulations for this hamiltonian yield a first order cubic - tetragonal transition at 660 k and a description of the system near the transition in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the strong involvement of pb atom in the lattice instability as well as anharmonicity and the coupling of polar distortions with homogeneous deformations of the lattice are found to be very important in producing the transition behaviour characteristic of @xmath0 .",
