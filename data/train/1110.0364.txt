    "the oldest and most used index for solar activity is the sunspot number ( @xmath0 ) or wolf number describing the number of sunspots @xmath1 and groups of sunspots @xmath2 that can be observed on the sun : @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0 index is computed daily and there is a complete record of values @xmath4 since the 1850 s , spanning solar cycles 10 - 23 . for the following we used the difference between daily @xmath0 numbers : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the count of days .",
    "the @xmath0 values have been obtained from the solar influences data analysis center of the royal observatory of belgium @xcite .",
    "the graph of @xmath7 as a function of time is presented in figure [ dsn ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 is linked to the mechanisms that generate sunspots with a periodicity of about 11 years . while there are deterministic mechanisms involved , there are also some stochastic mechanisms , responsible especially for the high day to day variability of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a statistical analysis of @xmath7 may reveal some characteristics of the latter type of mechanism .",
    "we will further refer to @xmath7 values and their characteristics determined from measured @xmath0 values as `` empirical '' values or characteristics .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 has been reconstructed both as a histogram and as a maximum entropy method ( mem ) distribution ( , @xcite ; ) .",
    "the mem distribution was built by imposing some local conditions and was determined using a modified form of the simulated annealing ( sa ) heuristic search algorithm @xcite .",
    "the details of the mem distribution are presented in appendix a.    the values of @xmath7 as computed from @xmath0 values are integer numbers .",
    "however , we argue that both @xmath0 and @xmath7 values can be thought as real numbers , where the fractional part expresses the degree with which a certain `` average sunspot '' is realised .",
    "thus , the maximum entropy distribution was extended into the set of real numbers .",
    "the distributions obtained were approximated on certain ranges of @xmath7 with exponential functions of the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a distribution parameter and @xmath10 is a constant such that @xmath11 has integral equal to 1 .",
    "the @xmath0 time series have both a deterministic component , which may be taken as the monthly or yearly average of @xmath0 , and a stochastic component , the latter appearing as daily fluctuations of @xmath0 around the average .",
    "both components have characteristic distributions .",
    "the basic models used in explaining the long - term ( on scales of months and above ) behaviour of the solar cycle are the dynamo models @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that this model may exhibit chaotic behaviour .",
    "discuss such a chaotic mechanism .",
    "their conclusions are that it has low dimensionality and similar behaviour to a rssler system of differential equations . on the other hand , model the solar cycle , transformed into a symmetrical space , through an autoregressive model with deterministic terms and stochastic residuals with gaussian distribution .",
    "the model obtained has a chaotic attractor similar to that of the rssler system .",
    "aguirre , letellier , and maquet point out that the sunspot number time series is nonstationary .",
    "approximated the time series of yealy averages of @xmath0 with an exponential function separately for the rising and declining phases .",
    "the exponential dependence indicates a power law distribution of the @xmath0 yearly averages for each phase . for larger time",
    "scales the distribution may deviate from the power law .",
    "the stochastic part of the @xmath0 time series has been analysed both in connection to a chaotic dynamo and as a separate term . in many studies",
    "exponential distributions and dependences were found .",
    "build a dynamo model with fractional brownian motion in order to explain the stochastic character of the @xmath0 time series .",
    "they determine the hurst exponent of @xmath0 to be @xmath12 on time scales from 20 to 350 days .",
    "this indicates a brownian motion with positive autocorrelation at work at these time scales .",
    "develop a model for the stochastic part of the @xmath0 time series which is represented as a diffusion process described by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the solution of this equation has an approximate exponential form .",
    "they find that at solar minima the @xmath0 index has a distribution with exponential tail .",
    "they also point out that the daily @xmath0 distribution is approximately exponential for the period 1850 - 2010 .",
    "looked at daily @xmath0 data in order to determine the type of flow in the sun s convective layer .",
    "the @xmath0 values indicate stochastic behaviour for cycles 10 - 19 and chaotic behaviour for cycles 20 - 23 , the last of which presents an increase in the stochastic character compared to previous cycles .",
    "salakhutdinova analysed the @xmath0 time series by separating it into a regular ( deterministic ) low frequency component and a stochastic high frequency component .",
    "the stochastic component has properties of white ( gaussian ) noise at time scales lower than two months and for time scales between two months and two years it has properties similar to pink ( flicker ) noise .",
    "the two kinds of properties may characterize two sub - components that combine to form the stochastic part of @xmath0 .",
    "generally , for large time scales the stochastic component can be associated with a chromatic noise with sharp maxima .",
    "the regular component behaves as a nonlinear oscillator , with similarities to a rssler system .",
    "compute the hurst index for the @xmath0 index and the h@xmath13 flare index for the period 1976 - 1996 .",
    "the two indices have similar hurst values ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) on intervals of 20 - 350 days and 24 - 450 days respectively .",
    "these show the presence of long - range autocorrelations for the two solar activity indices for the period 1976 - 1996 .",
    "the authors determined the distribution of normalised fluctuations of the @xmath0 and h@xmath13 flare indices .",
    "the fluctuations were computed as 1-day differences of the respective indices .",
    "next , these differences were normalised by subtracting their average value and then dividing by their root mean square value . for both indices ,",
    "the probability density functions are stretched exponentials of the form @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath0 they found @xmath17 , which is very close to a laplace distribution and for the flare index @xmath18 .",
    "analyse the coronal emission time series at 530.3 nm from 1949 to 1996 with the proper orthogonal decomposition method .",
    "the method uses a series expansion of the coronal emission relative to some basis functions by means of coefficients which depend on time .",
    "the authors determined the distribution of the 1-day difference of each coefficient s values .",
    "the probability density function is similar to a stretched exponential for the central part of the distribution , where @xmath19 is close to 1 .",
    "model the flare energy distribution and waiting times for two solar active regions spanning each about one month .",
    "they find that the flare frequency - size index has a power law distribution , while the waiting times have an exponential distribution .",
    "the parameter of the exponential distribution may suffer a jump in time , as found for one of the two active regions .",
    "this jump is explained in a jump - transition model by corresponding step changes in the rates of energy input and flare transition .",
    "nevertheless , between step changes the waiting times distribution is a stable exponential distribution .",
    "in order to obtain the distribution of @xmath7 , daily data from cycles 10 - 23 were used .",
    "the values of @xmath7 range from -91 to 112 .",
    "the empirical values of @xmath7 were computed from the registered @xmath0 values and then the empirical probability @xmath20 was determined by counting the occurrence of each value of @xmath7 .",
    "the probability for each @xmath7 is presented in figure [ romem ] . by applying a least squares fit to @xmath21 , it was found that @xmath20 can be approximated well with exponential functions ( [ exp ] ) with the following parameters : @xmath22 for @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 for @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the goodness of fit is characterised by the correlation coefficient @xmath26 in both cases .",
    "outside these intervals @xmath20 diverges from the exponential fit .",
    "a special case is @xmath27 , for which the probability is much bigger than probabilities associated to other values of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it appears that @xmath27 represents a special state .",
    "we propose a model to describe the general behaviour of @xmath7 , according to which the probability density function ( pdf ) of values of @xmath7 in the set of real numbers is of the form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dirac distribution , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are probability density functions associated with negative and positive values of @xmath7 respectively and @xmath32 are probabilities associated with the respective intervals of @xmath7 . from the empirical distribution",
    "determined above , @xmath33 . since @xmath34 , we take @xmath35 .",
    "the density functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 have been determined by the maximum entropy method ( see appendix a ) .",
    "note that the empirical probabilities @xmath20 can be taken as ( smoothed ) pdf values associated with the corresponding values of @xmath7 since pdf is probability divided by corresponding interval and @xmath20 corresponds to an interval of @xmath7 of length 1 .",
    "[ lnromem ]",
    "we collected @xmath38 empirical values of @xmath7 . in order to determine the pdfs @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath31 all values of 0 were eliminated , according to model ( 3 ) .",
    "we used @xmath39 @xmath7 values for @xmath30 and @xmath40 values for @xmath31 .",
    "the pdf estimate obtained is presented in figure [ romem ] ; also , its logarithm is represented along exponential fits computed by the least squares method for @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] respectively .",
    "the fits have parameters @xmath41 for @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath42 for @xmath25 $ ]",
    ". the goodness of fit is characterised by @xmath43 .",
    "these are very close to the empirical data fits .",
    "we conclude that indeed there is an exponential law in the distribution of @xmath7 .    from both the empirical values and the mem distribution",
    "it can be seen that the distribution of @xmath7 changes abruptly from the exponential approximations for small @xmath44 .",
    "there are two local maxima at about @xmath45 and @xmath7 between 7 and 8",
    ". there may be an observational cause for this characteristic .",
    "when the @xmath0 index is computed from sunspot observations , each group of sunspots counts as 10 individual sunspots , thus it may be easier to observe a higher value , e.g. @xmath46 than smaller values .",
    "thus , jumps from previous values of @xmath47 to @xmath48 and back may be more probable than other jumps around the cycles minima .    for values of @xmath49",
    "the mem distribution registers a variation that is steeper than the same variation in the empirical probability .",
    "the values of pdf increase up to about @xmath50 and then drop a little . whether this is",
    "a real feature is uncertain .",
    "it is possible that it represents a spurious feature of the mem as it tries to recover a uniform distribution at the edges , where there are fewer effective constraints .",
    "for values @xmath51 the mem pdf diverges from the exponential approximations , which is supported by the empirical distribution of @xmath7 . at the edge of the interval for @xmath7 considered for building the mem pdf , a sharp increase appears .",
    "the latter is a spurious feature . in this area",
    "the conditions have very small values , such that the entropy exceeds the value of the quadratic error @xmath52 ( see appendix ) .",
    "thus , the optimisation is done by maximising the entropy , which shifts the distribution toward a uniform distribution .",
    "the entropy may also affect the divergence from the exponential law for @xmath53 ; thus , we consider that the mem pdf gives only a qualitative description for very high values of @xmath44 .",
    "this is not very significant though , as the values of the pdf are below @xmath54 in this region , far smaller than those close to @xmath27 .      in order to determine the time scale at which the exponential law is valid ,",
    "the moving average and standard deviation of @xmath7 were computed for different time intervals and their values were compared to theoretical values computed with ( [ exp ] ) and @xmath55 , where the sign was taken @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "all computations were carried out for @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ mediesigma ] .",
    "the best localisation , _",
    "i.e. _ the smallest time interval for which the distribution of @xmath7 is close to the theoretical distribution ( [ exp ] ) , is obtained for a time span of about 11 years or approximately one solar cycle period .",
    "cycles 10 and 11 stand out as anomalies , since their standard deviation is very different from the theoretical one even for large time intervals .",
    "for the cycles 12 - 23 , the standard deviation is close to the theoretical value with displacements of about 10% from the theoretical standard deviation .",
    "the results obtained for a 1 year time interval show where deviations from the exponential law occur .",
    "the average @xmath7 has sharp peaks during cycles minima .",
    "the standard deviation has maxima and minima corresponding to the maxima and minima of solar cycles .",
    "its maxima are close to the theoretical standard deviation , while the minima are far from it .",
    "it appears thus that deviations from the exponential law occur around minima of the solar cycles .",
    "this is partly a consequence of the fact that the minima are populated with only a few values of @xmath44 above 10 ; thus , the sharp behaviour is partly generated by fluctuations in the average and standard deviation of @xmath44 .",
    "the difference @xmath7 between @xmath0 consecutive values at a fixed date can be reduced to two components : a smooth deterministic variation @xmath61 and an error ( or fluctuation ) term @xmath62 , such that @xmath63 a similar relation holds between the variances of the terms implied : @xmath64 where @xmath65 represents the variance and @xmath66 the covariance of the respective quantities .",
    "we tested to see whether one of the terms @xmath61 , @xmath62 is far more important than the other .",
    "if this were the case , it is expected that the negligible term would have negligible statistical characteristics and its distribution would have a negligible contribution in the @xmath7 overall distribution . since the averages of the @xmath7 components above are close to 0 , the test was carried on their variances . moving variances on intervals of one year were used .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ varn ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath67 is at least 100 times greater than @xmath68 or @xmath69 , thus by far the most important component of @xmath7 appears to be the fluctuation @xmath62 .",
    "the exponential distribution can be assumed to be given by @xmath7 fluctuations and not its deterministic component .",
    "the most important characteristic of the distribution of @xmath7 is its almost perfect symmetry with respect to the vertical axis .",
    "the small differences in the mem pdf between negative and positive values of @xmath7 are not well supported by empirical values and we consider them spurious phenomena , due to the stochastic nature of the simulated annealing algorithm and to noise in the initial data .",
    "overall , the distribution of @xmath7 has several areas of specific variation : ( i ) for low values of @xmath44 the pdf decreases as @xmath44 increases , probably exponentially , but this is uncertain because of the small number of points . around @xmath70",
    "the pdf has a slight but abrupt rise .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath44 between 10 and 60 it obeys an exponential law of an approximate form : @xmath71 with @xmath72 experimentally and @xmath73 in the mem pdf ; @xmath10 is a constant .",
    "( iii ) for very large @xmath44 the pdf decreases somewhat faster than exponential with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "the distribution ( [ laplace ] ) appears to be valid only when whole cycles are considered . for small time intervals ,",
    "the @xmath7 distribution may deviate from the exponential law .",
    "this happens especially around minima of the solar cycles .",
    "the presence of the exponential law dependence is interesting in itself .",
    "this result was previously found by for @xmath0 values spanning a 20 year period . here",
    "the result is investigated in more detail and for a longer time period .",
    "the formula ( [ laplace ] ) represents a laplace distribution centered at @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the deviations from this law happen for very low values of @xmath44 , which occur especially ( but not only ) in the minima of solar cycles , and also for very high values of @xmath44 , which occur at the maxima of solar cycles .",
    "the latter case happens only for a few values of the solar cycles analysed , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath51 , as can be seen from figure 1 .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that overall the exponential law holds for all values of @xmath44 of statistical significance , except values around @xmath27 .",
    "the failure of the exponential law for small @xmath44 may be due to the way the sunspot number ( @xmath0 ) is computed by counting both individual sunspots and groups of sunspots .",
    "this is especially significant for solar cycles minima , where abrupt jumps from @xmath47 to @xmath74 may easily appear .",
    "nevertheless , the value @xmath27 stays above the laplace pdf ( [ laplace ] ) .",
    "the obtained results can be applied in the field of stochastic predictive models for solar activity and space weather .",
    "the daily stochastic behaviour is superposed over a long - term cyclic characteristic .",
    "these daily fluctuations may be represented as a stochastic process with jumps distributed according to ( [ laplace ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , such a stochastic process would give only an average , long - term representation .",
    "it must be completed with additional terms that give the exact distribution at smaller time scales .",
    "these terms are yet to be determined .",
    "the laplace distribution of @xmath7 is linked to the exponential distribution of @xmath0 , as evidenced by . indeed , by assuming that daily @xmath0 values are independent and identically distributed random variables with exponential distributions , the difference of any two @xmath0 variables is a random variable with a laplace distribution",
    ". however , the @xmath0 values are not independent on a day - to - day basis .",
    "similarly , the laplace distribution does not appear at a daily level , but rather at whole cycle levels .",
    "we hypothesize that the laplace distribution of @xmath7 appears at time intervals for which the beginning and end values of @xmath0 are completely independent .",
    "it is expected that the distribution is stationary at this time scale .",
    "this seems to be the case for 11 year intervals , as seen from figure [ mediesigma ] , where both the average and standard deviation tend to become stable in time . nevertheless , the standard deviation still has strong jumps even at this time scale , possibly showing abrupt changes in the laplace distribution parameter @xmath9 from one cycle to the next .",
    "the long time span at which stability occurs may be a characteristic of the magnetic flux tubes lying in the convective layer , which is preserved at least until the magnetic field changes polarity . as they emerge through the photosphere",
    ", the flux tubes reveal this characteristic in the form of the laplace distribution of @xmath7",
    ". nevertheless , other more complex processes are at work for small time scales , where the distribution is highly irregular .",
    "the maximum entropy approach for probability distributions consists in determining the distribution that maximises the entropy with some imposed constraints .",
    "we present the way it was applied in the present work .",
    "each pdf @xmath75 , @xmath76 was determined separately as sets of probabilities @xmath77 , @xmath78 associated with corresponding values @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , which were next transformed into pdf values .",
    "this is a general approach to building a continuous pdf which eliminates the need for a prior model to fit @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the number @xmath82 of values of @xmath7 considered in each case is much greater than the empirical number of probability values .",
    "the values @xmath83 , @xmath84 where chosen at equal distances in the corresponding intervals .",
    "we illustrate below the path followed for @xmath57 ; for @xmath59 we proceeded in a similar fashion .",
    "the shannon discrete entropy was used : @xmath85 next , some local constraints were imposed on the distribution .",
    "these were built with a gaussian function : @xmath86 the points @xmath87 are equally distanced in the interval of @xmath88 .",
    "the method of kernel density estimation uses similar functions for building a pdf estimate with good results @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath89 were averaged , yielding empirical values @xmath90 computed over @xmath91 empirical values of @xmath92 collected from the 14 last cycles and also simulated averages @xmath93 computed with the values @xmath94 and their associated probabilities",
    "@xmath77 : @xmath95 a quadratic error was used : @xmath96 when the error e is minimised , the obtained distribution presents a lot of noise . in order to smooth it ,",
    "the entropy h was maximised along with the minimisation of e. thus , the function to be minimised was taken of the form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a constant that regulates the degree of smoothing . for big @xmath98",
    "the distribution obtained is close to the uniform distribution , while for very small @xmath98 the distribution has a lot of noise .",
    "based on tests carried on some known distributions , a value of @xmath99 was found to be sufficient .    in order to find the minimum of @xmath100 a modified version of the simulated annealing ( sa ) algorithm was used . in the original algorithm ,",
    "a temperature parameter is decreased during the run in order to control the convergence towards the absolute minimum .",
    "we found this to be unnecessary , thus we set the temperature to 0 .",
    "also , in the original algorithm , at each step , the solution vector @xmath101 is constructed by modifying all its elements at random at each step .",
    "we found this to be detrimental and the modification was carried on only one element chosen at random at each step .",
    "the rate of change of the vector elements was decreased as the algorithm proceeded .",
    "a number of @xmath102 conditions were used in each case .",
    "an equal number of values of @xmath87 , @xmath103 were generated in the intervals @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] respectively . in each case",
    "the solution was a vector of @xmath106 probabilities @xmath107 , @xmath108 , corresponding to equally distanced values of @xmath7 set in the above intervals .",
    "thus , in each interval there are about 10 times more simulated probability values for the pdf than empirical values .",
    "the conditions parameter @xmath109 was chosen such that each condition covers a significant part of the interval of values of @xmath7 .",
    "it vas taken equal to @xmath110 of the length of the interval in each case .",
    "this gives a width at half - height for each @xmath89 of about 10 units of @xmath7 and a base coverage of about 20 units of @xmath7 .",
    "the functions @xmath89 have maxima distanced at about 1 unit of @xmath7 , thus yielding a dense set of conditions .",
    "this value of @xmath109 was tested on some known distributions and was found satisfactory . + * acknowledgements * we are grateful to professor gelu m. nita from the center for solar - terrestrial research of the new jersey institute of technology for helpful discussions and suggestions regarding this work .",
