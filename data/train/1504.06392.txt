    "<S> we propose the pure sea - quark contributions to the magnetic form factors of @xmath0 baryons , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as priority observables for the examination of sea - quark contributions to baryon structure , both in present lattice qcd simulations and possible future experimental measurement . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 , the @xmath3-quark contribution to the magnetic form factor of @xmath4 , and @xmath2 , the @xmath5-quark contribution to the magnetic form factor of @xmath6 , are similar to the strange quark contribution to the magnetic form factor of the nucleon , but promise to be larger by an order of magnitude . we explore the size of this quantity within chiral effective field theory , including both octet and decuplet intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> the finite range regularization approach is applied to deal with ultraviolet divergences . </S>",
    "<S> drawing on an established connection between quenched and full qcd , this approach makes it possible to predict the sea quark contribution to the magnetic form factor purely from the meson loop . in the familiar convention where the quark charge is set to unity @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a value of @xmath8 , which is about seven times larger than the strange magnetic moment of the nucleon found in the same approach . including quark charge factors , the @xmath3-quark contribution to the @xmath4 magnetic moment exceeds the strange quark contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment by a factor of 14 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that a complete characterization of baryon substructure must go beyond three valence quarks . </S>",
    "<S> strange quark contributions to the properties of the nucleon have attracted a lot of interest since the originally puzzling emc results concerning the proton spin  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while that particular motivation has faded  @xcite , the role of the sea remains a central issue in qcd , especially with respect to lattice </S>",
    "<S> qcd . </S>",
    "<S> there such terms involve so - called `` disconnected graphs '' ; that is , quark loops which are connected only by gluons to the valence quarks . despite enormous effort  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , only one direct lattice qcd calculation has produced a non - zero result  @xcite , albeit with errors which mean that it is not statistically different from zero .    </S>",
    "<S> with very few exceptions , the form factor studies , which complement the recent experimental progress at facilities such as jefferson lab , deal with so called connected contributions , in which the external current acts on a quark line running directly from the hadronic source to sink . as discussed below , only a few studies have directly addressed the disconnected contributions . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most famous example of a disconnected contribution is the strange quark contribution to the nucleon elastic form factors  . </S>",
    "<S> its fundamental importance is associated with the fact that it is directly analogous to the vacuum polarization contribution to the lamb shift , the correct calculation of which confirmed the validity of quantum electrodynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> parity - violating electron scattering ( pves ) has proven to be a valuable tool for experimentally determining the strange quark contribution to the electromagnetic form factors of the proton . under the assumption of charge symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , one can deduce the strange electric or magnetic form factor ( @xmath9 ) from measurements of the corresponding proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors _ and _ the neutral - weak vector form factor of the proton , through its contribution to pves . </S>",
    "<S> while pves measurements are very challenging , a number of groups have succeeded , starting with sample at bates  @xcite and then a4 at mainz  @xcite and g0  @xcite and happex  @xcite at jefferson lab . up to now , the experiments have not provided an unambiguous confirmed answer to the sign of the strange form factors , although global analyses do tend to suggest that @xmath10 is favoured  @xcite .    though there exist predictions of the strange form factors from lattice with the help of charge symmetry  @xcite , it is difficult to simulate this quantity directly because it is purely from the disconnected diagrams and is also quite small . </S>",
    "<S> even an unambiguous determination of the sign of the strange form factor is an important step in the quest to understand the structure of nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> it is related to how the strange and anti - strange quarks are distributed in the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the strange form factor will shed light on whether the @xmath11 components in nucleon is dominated by colored di - quark configurations or by color singlet configurations  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose that the quantity @xmath1 , the @xmath3-quark contribution to the magnetic form factor of @xmath4 or similarly @xmath2 , the @xmath5 quark contribution to the magnetic form factor of @xmath6 , is equally important to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> because the light quark mass of the @xmath3 or @xmath5 quark governs the magnitude of the contribution , it is expected to be larger and less difficult to measure in lattice qcd . </S>",
    "<S> it is similar to the strange form factor in the sense that both of the quantities arise purely from `` disconnected '' sea - quark contributions . </S>",
    "<S> however , in an effective field theory framework , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are generated by a @xmath13 meson loop , which should be much larger than the strange form factor generated from a @xmath14 meson loop . </S>",
    "<S> they will serve as an ideal quantity for future lattice simulations and will shed light on the sea quark properties of baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> chiral effective field theory ( eft ) is a useful tool with which to study hadron properties at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> there has been some work on strange form factors with heavy baryon chiral eft  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is an unknown low energy constant appearing in the chiral lagrangian , which has limited the capacity to calculate the strange magnetic form factor . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the quantity one wishes to predict  the strangeness vector current matrix element  is the same quantity one needs to know in order to make a prediction  @xcite . while this is the case in conventional chiral eft , experience with finite - range - regularization ( frr ) , </S>",
    "<S> has shown that by varying the regulator parameter , one can model the shift in strength from the loop contributions into the core . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that within frr @xmath15-eft one might identify the core contribution with the tree level contribution and make the approximation that , for @xmath16 in the region of 0.8 gev , the sea quark content of the core is negligible . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , full qcd results have been obtained rather successfully from quenched lattice data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we should emphasize that unquenching only works for the particular choice of regulator mass , @xmath16 around 0.8 gev , because only then does one define a core contribution that is approximately invariant between quenched and full qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> we will apply heavy baryon chiral effective field theory with finite range regularization to study the pure sea - quark contribution to the magnetic form factors of @xmath0 baryons . in presenting the formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we choose to focus on the @xmath5-quark contribution to @xmath6 form factors . </S>",
    "<S> this channel is very similar to the @xmath17-quark contribution to the proton . in the standard convention where the quark charge is set to unity @xmath7 .    in heavy baryon </S>",
    "<S> chiral eft , the lowest order chiral lagrangian for the baryon - meson interaction which will be used in the calculation of the magnetic form factor , including the octet and decuplet baryons , is expressed as @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\cal c}(\\bar{t}_v^\\mu a_\\mu b_v+\\bar{b}_v a_\\mu t_v^\\mu),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the covariant spin - operator defined as @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the baryon four velocity ( in the rest frame , we have @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the usual su(3 ) coupling constants . </S>",

    "<S> the coupling constant @xmath60 is chosen to be @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the regulator function , @xmath62 , could be chosen to be a monopole , dipole or gaussian function , any of which would give similar results  @xcite . in our calculations , </S>",
    "<S> a dipole form is chosen because that is the empirical shape of the nucleon axial form factor  @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath64 gev .    as we explained earlier , </S>",
    "<S> this choice has been widely applied in the extrapolation of lattice data for hadron mass , moments , form factors , radii , first moments of gpds , etc .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . with this choice </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that reasonable physical results can be obtained from the quenched lattice data at both leading and next leading order  @xcite . @xmath16 around 0.8 gev is the value required to identify a core contribution that is invariant between quenched and full qcd . </S>",
    "<S> this invariance of the core is based upon the assumption that the 3-quark core of the @xmath6 contains no @xmath5 quark component .    while our calculation is motivated by chiral effective field theory with the same chiral lagrangian , </S>",
    "<S> our calculation with frr is at a physically motivated scale , where earlier work has suggested that the residual series of analytic terms best describes the three - quark core contributions . from the previous extrapolation of </S>",
    "<S> quenched lattice data , it is found that this preferred value of @xmath16 in the dipole regulator is around 0.8 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of @xmath16 from 0.6 to 1 gev provides an estimate of the degree of model dependence of our result .    </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the pure sea - quark contribution to the @xmath0 magnetic moment at leading and next - to - leading order is shown in table i. the leading order diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) gives a negative contribution to the magnetic form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from the next - to - leading order diagrams are much smaller than the leading contribution . </S>",
    "<S> they depend on the parameter @xmath65 . assuming su(3 ) symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , one has @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this relation was applied in our previous investigation of nucleon magnetic form factors @xcite . in the previous extrapolation of nucleon magnetic form factors , we found @xmath67 equal @xmath68  @xmath56 and @xmath69  @xmath56 for full qcd and quenched qcd extrapolations , respectively  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , @xmath70  @xmath56 should be a good estimate .     </S>",
    "<S> dependence of the @xmath5-quark contribution to the magnetic form factor of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper , middle and lower lines are for @xmath71 , 0.8 and 1.0 gev , respectively . in the standard convention @xmath72.,width=302 ]    in fig .  2 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the magnetic form factor @xmath73 versus @xmath74 at @xmath75 0.6 , 0.8 and 1.0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that @xmath76 decreases in magnitude with the increasing @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the magnetic form factor does not change sign for any of the choices of @xmath16 when @xmath74 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is just like the strange magnetic form factor of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> however , the absolute value of @xmath73 is about one order of magnitude larger than @xmath77 . since its absolute value decreases with the increasing @xmath74 , it would be preferable to attempt to measure the magnetic form factor at low @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when @xmath74 is less than 0.2 gev@xmath78 , the absolute central value of @xmath2 is larger than 0.2 @xmath56 .    at @xmath79 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 quark contribution to the magnetic moment of the @xmath6 is @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> if we vary @xmath16 from 0.6 gev to 1 gev , @xmath81 will change from @xmath82  @xmath56 to @xmath83  @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that @xmath81 remains negative over a large parameter range . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the strange magnetic moment of the proton , the value of @xmath81 is about seven times larger  @xcite .    for unit charge sea - quarks , @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the magnitude of the sea - quark contribution further doubles in an experimental measurement of the contribution of the @xmath3 quark to the form factor of @xmath4 .    motivated by the importance of establishing the properties of disconnected contributions to physical quantities in lattice </S>",
    "<S> qcd , we have shown that @xmath84 and @xmath73 have the practical advantage that their values are much larger than the strange magnetic form factor of the nucleon . since the absolute value of @xmath73 is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the strange magnetic form factor of the nucleon , it would clearly be better to simulate this quantity in place of the strange form factor of the nucleon .    </S>",
    "<S> since the lattice simulations will almost certainly be made over a range of light quark masses , we have investigated the pion mass dependence of @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  3 , where the upper , middle and lower lines are for @xmath75 0.6 , 0.8 and 1 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> from the figure , one can see that with increasing quark mass the absolute value of @xmath81 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> however , even at @xmath86 = 0.2 gev@xmath78 , @xmath81 is still much larger than the strange magnetic moment of the nucleon at the physical pion mass .    </S>",
    "<S> an additional feature of the @xmath0 baryon is the presence of a strange quark in the two - point correlation function . in calculating the disconnected sea - quark contribution , </S>",
    "<S> one multiplies the disconnected loop by the standard two - point function in creating the full three - point function . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a strange quark in the two - point function will assist in reducing statistical noise in the three - point correlation function for the pure sea - quark contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> -quark contribution to the magnetic moment of the @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper , middle and lower lines are for @xmath71 , 0.8 and 1.0 gev , respectively . in the standard convention @xmath72.,width=309 ]    given that @xmath73 is dominated by the contribution of a @xmath13 meson loop and having strange quarks in the two - point correlation function is advantageous , one might also consider the @xmath5 quark contribution to the magnetic form factor of the @xmath87 or the the @xmath3 quark contribution to the magnetic form factor of the @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities are also determined by a @xmath13 meson loop . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coupling of @xmath13 and @xmath87 is much smaller resulting in a very small value of @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath2 has unique advantages with respect to studies of the contributions to the structure of baryons through disconnected sea quark terms .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have argued the importance of studying the pure sea - quark contributions to @xmath0-baryon form factors , @xmath84 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the significant enhancement associated with the light @xmath3 or @xmath5 quarks , these observables have distinct quantitative advantages over the strange form factors of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement arises because the pure light sea - quark contribution to the magnetic form factors of @xmath0 baryons is dominated by the @xmath13-meson cloud contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is much larger than the nucleon strange magnetic form factor which originates in the @xmath14-meson cloud .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculated @xmath84 and @xmath73 within heavy baryon chiral effective field theory including both octet and decuplet intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> the pure sea - quark contribution to the magnetic moment is @xmath90 , which is about seven times larger than the nucleon strange magnetic moment and 14 times larger for @xmath84 in experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated the pion mass dependence of the pure sea - quark contributions . </S>",
    "<S> when the pion mass is about 300 - 400 mev , the absolute value of @xmath81 is still around @xmath91 @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that future lattice simulations may be able to determine @xmath2 directly with more accuracy than the strange form factor of the nucleon , @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the value or even the sign of @xmath73 would be very helpful in pinning down the size and origin of five - quark configurations in baryons . </S>"
