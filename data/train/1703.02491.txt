    "ever since the successful exfoliation of graphene was achieved , there has been considerable effort both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite to exploit its electronic , photonic and mechanical properties .",
    "because of its flexibility , robust strength , heightened intrinsic mobility , high thermal and electrical conductivity and zero band gap at the @xmath1 point , linear dispersion and massless fermions , scientists have envisioned potential application for graphene - based electronic devices in the semiconductor industry .",
    "creating pristine graphene in commercial quantities with a specific band gap is a major challenge in its use for nanoelectronic devices .",
    "some of the intriguing properties which have received a great deal of attention include the doping and temperature dependence of plasmon excitations and their energy dispersion dependence on the direction of the wave vector in the brillouin zone for graphene @xcite , the klein paradox @xcite , the veselago lens @xcite , screened impurity potential @xcite , effect of magnetic field @xcite to name just a few .    placing a graphene layer in close proximity with a substrate such as silicon carbide , copper , hexagonal boron nitride or doping the graphene sheet with a variety of elements such as hydrogen , fluorine or chlorine are some ways for designing the energy band structure of graphene in a specified way . of these mentioned ways ,",
    "this paper is primarily concerned with an investigation of the properties of oxygenated graphene , also known as graphene oxide ( go ) .",
    "these gos , doped by oxygen atom either on one side or both sides , are considered to be useful for a wide variety of device - based applications including supercapacitors @xcite , energy storage @xcite , sensors @xcite , mermistors @xcite and water purification @xcite .",
    "manufacturing go commercially at a reasonable cost and in an environmentally favorable manner is another challenge for this material . there",
    "exist several methods for producing go . in 1859 , brodie @xcite treated graphite with @xmath2 , an oxidant , to oxidize graphite in @xmath3 .",
    "staudenmaier @xcite improved this method later by adding @xmath4 to increase the acidity of the mixture .",
    "hummer @xcite further developed this method by adding a mixture of @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "this latter method is the most widely used because of its shorter reaction time and no @xmath7 emission @xcite .",
    "modification of hummer s method is the addition of @xmath8 with @xmath4 in the absence of @xmath5 and increasing the amount of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the gos have been manufactured using a bottom - up method since this process is simpler and more acceptable from an environmental point of view compared with traditionally top - down methods .",
    "different oxygen concentration may be synthesized by controlling the amount of oxidant @xmath6 .",
    "also , go has been manufactured using a bottom - up tang - lau method since it is simpler and meets environmental standards compared with traditionally top - down methods @xcite .",
    "the concentration of oxygen may be controlled by regulating the amount of the oxidant compound @xmath6@xcite , or the oxidation time .",
    "our aim in this paper is to shed light on the electronic properties and geometrical structure of graphene oxide with the use of the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy due to the electron - electron interactions is calculated from the perdew - burke - ernzerhof functional under the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "the projector - augmented wave pseudopotentials are employed to evaluate the electron - ion interactions @xcite . a plane - wave basis set with a maximum plane - wave energy of 500 ev",
    "is used for the valence electron wave functions . the convergence criterion for one full relaxation is mainly determined by setting the hellmann - feynman forces smaller than @xmath9a and the total energy difference less than @xmath10 .",
    "the first brillouin zone is sampled in a gamma scheme by @xmath11 k points for structure relaxations , and then by @xmath12 k points for further calculations on electronic properties .",
    "we present our results for different concentrations of c / o . also , we reported the dos and energy band structure of gos to address the critical issue of how to modulate the band gap of graphene .",
    "the outline of the rest of our presentation is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present and discuss our results for the band structure of go for various adatom dopings , its geometrical structure and dos .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "the stable adsorption position of o atoms on graphene is determined by comparing the total ground state energies , in which the lower value corresponds to higher stability . among the bridge- , hollow- and top - sites ,",
    "our calculations show that the bridge is the most stable one and the top - site is the least stable , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "after self - consistent calculations , we found that all the go systems , with various concentrations and distributions , have stable structures with very slight buckling present as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the main features of geometric structures , including the c - c and c - o bond lengths are dominated by the o - concentrations , as shown in table 1 . as oxygen atoms",
    "are adsorbed on graphene , the c - c bond lengths are dramatically expanded to 1.53 @xmath13 for the case of single - side adsorption ( @xmath14% ) , which is close to @xmath15 @xmath13 sp@xmath16 bond length in diamond .",
    "the c - c bond lengths gradually recover to that in pristine graphene ( 1.42 @xmath13 ) with the decrease of o - concentration , which is consistent with experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite results . however , the c - o bond lengths exhibit the opposite dependence .",
    "these results indicate that the stronger orbital hybridizations in c - o bonds significantly reduce their lengths and even weaken the @xmath17 bonds in c - c bonds .",
    "there exists a partial transformation from sp@xmath18 bonds in pristine graphene into sp@xmath16 bonds , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned rich geometric structures lead to diverse electronic properties .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) band structures along with high symmetry points are useful for examining the electronic properties .",
    "when oxygen atoms are adsorbed on graphene , the energy dispersion relations exhibits dramatic changes with the variations in o - concentrations and o - distributions . for monolayer graphene",
    ", the sp@xmath18 orbitals of ( 2p@xmath19 , 2p@xmath20 , 2s ) possess very strong covalent @xmath17-bonds among the three nearest - neighbor carbon atoms , while the 2p@xmath21 orbitals contribute to the weak @xmath0-bonds , being associated with the dirac - cone structure right at the fermi - level ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands form the high - lying electronic structures within a range of @xmath25 3 ev , in which the extremum energies are at the @xmath1 point .",
    "the band structures of double - side and single - side adsorptions gos are shown in fig . 2 and fig .  [ fig:3 ] , respectively .",
    "the contributions of o atoms and c atoms passivated with the former are represented by blue and red circles , respectively , in which the dominance is proportional to the circle s radius .",
    "different from pristine graphene , the isotropic dirac - cone structure near the @xmath1 point is destroyed , mainly owing to the serious hybridization between the atomic orbitals of o and passivated c atoms ( c atoms bonded o ) . instead , there are wide energy gaps ( figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a)-(c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) ) and o - dominated energy bands nearest to @xmath22 ( blue circles ) .",
    "that is , the @xmath0 bonds due to the neighboring bonds of parallel 2@xmath26 orbitals are replaced by the orbital hybridizations of o - o bonds . as to the strong orbital hybridizations of passivated c atoms and o atoms ( red and blue circles dominate simultaneously ) ,",
    "their energy bands are located in -2.5 ev@xmath27 - 4 ev .",
    "the deeper @xmath17-bands with @xmath28 - 4 ev are formed by the rather strong hybridization of ( 2@xmath29 , 2@xmath30 , 2s ) orbitals in c - c bonds almost independent of o - adsorption . with the decrease of o - concentrations ,",
    "the o - dominated bands become narrower and contribute at deeper energy , while the @xmath0 bands are gradually recovered ( fig .  [ fig:2](d ) and figs .",
    "[ fig:3](b)-(f ) ) .",
    "this leads to a reduced band gap and the reformation of a distorted dirac - cone structure .",
    "the energy gap ( @xmath31 ) values are sensitive to changes in the o - concentration and -distribution , as listed in table 1 .",
    "they could be divided into three categories , although the dependence on the o - concentration is non - monotonic @xcite . the go systems always have a finite gap for o - concentrations higher than 25% , mainly owing to the sufficiently strong o - o and c - o bonds .",
    "in addition , @xmath31 values are also affected by double - side or single - side adsorptions .",
    "compared to the double - side adsorption of 50% o - concentration , the single - side ones possess larger band gaps , mainly owing to the stronger interactions between o atoms . in the concentration range of 25 - 4% ,",
    "the @xmath31 values decline quickly .",
    "this might exhibit small or vanishing gaps related to the reformed distorted dirac cones fig . [",
    "fig:2](d ) and figs .",
    "[ fig:3](c)-(d ) ) .",
    "the energy gap becomes zero for low concentrations of @xmath324% .",
    "this is induced by the fully reformed dirac cones without energy spacing ( figs . [ fig:3](e)-(f ) ) .",
    "these feature - rich energy bands of gos , including the absence and presence of the distorted dirac - cone structures , and the band gap are expected to be examined by arpes . by controlling the o - coverage ,",
    "the band gap of graphene may be significantly adjusted , which opens up the scope for potential use in nanoelectronic devices .",
    "the main characteristics of the band structures are directly reflected in the doss , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the predicted c - o and o - o bonds as a results of oxygen adsorption are clearly viewed by the orbital - projected doss .",
    "the low - energy dos is dramatically altered after oxygens are adsorbed on graphene . for pristine graphene , the peaks caused by @xmath0 and @xmath33 bands due to 2@xmath26 - 2@xmath26 bond between c atoms will dominate within the range of -2 ev@xmath342 ev . moreover , a vanishing gapless dos near @xmath350 indicates the zero - gap semiconducting behavior .",
    "however , for high o - concentrations , the @xmath0 and @xmath36-peaks are absent as a result of the strong c - o bond . instead , there are energy gaps and several o - dominated prominent structures in a wide range of @xmath28 - 2.5 to @xmath22 ( figs .",
    "[ fig:4].(a)-(c ) ; figs .",
    "[ fig:4](e)-(f ) ) .",
    "also , the magnitude of the energy gap depends on the competition between the o - o bonds and the @xmath0 bonds . concerning the middle - energy range of -2.5 ev@xmath27 - 4 ev , the doss grow quickly and",
    "exhibit prominent peaks due to the c - o bonds . with the decrease in the o - concentration , the @xmath0 and @xmath36 -peaks",
    "are gradually reformed at low energy , while the o - dominated structures present a narrower width and large red shift deeper from the fermi level ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d ) ; ( figs .   [ fig:4](g)-(j ) ) .",
    "the critical features in doss , mainly the finite or vanished energy gaps , the @xmath0- and @xmath33-peaks , the o - dominated special structures , and the ( c , o)-dominated prominent peaks can be further verified by sts , giving useful information in determining the oxygen concentration .",
    "in summary , an important result coming out of our study is that the eletronic and geometric structure of graphene may be modified by oxygenation either from one side or from both side .",
    "depending on the distribution and the concentration of the adsorbed oxygen atom , the bond lengths between c - c and c - o change .",
    "this leads to the reconstruction of the electronic structure causing the energy band structure to be modified .",
    "a finite energy gap emerges as a result of doping and the value of this band gap increases if the level of doping is increased .",
    "the emerged energy band gap also depends on single side or double side oxygen adsorption .",
    "this behaviour in fact plays an important role in tuning the band gap and modulating the energy band structure of gos which could be used in designing the on - off feature in semiconductor devices .",
