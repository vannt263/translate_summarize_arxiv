    "in the seventeenth century , kepler discovered the laws of the motion of celestial objects . since then , a fundamental problem has been how to determine the orbital elements ( and the mass ) of a binary from observational data of its positions projected onto a celestial sphere .",
    "in fact , astrometric observations play an important role in astronomy through determining a mass of various unseen celestial objects currently such as a massive black hole ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , an extra - solar planet ( benedict et al . 2002 ) and two new satellites of pluto ( weaver et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the orbit determination of _ resolved double stars _ was solved first by savary in 1827 , secondly by encke 1832 , thirdly by herschel 1833 and by many authors including kowalsky , thiele and innes ( aitken 1964 for a review on earlier works ; for the state - of - the - art techniques , e.g , eichhorn and xu 1990 , catovic and olevic 1992 , olevic and cvetkovic 2004 ) . here , resolved double stars are a system of two stars both of which can be seen .",
    "the relative vector from the primary star to the secondary is in an elliptic motion with a focus at the primary .",
    "this relative vector is observable because the two stars are seen . on the other hand , an _",
    "astrometric binary _ is a system of two objects where one object can be seen but the other can not like a black hole or a very dim star . in this case , it is impossible to directly measure the relative vector connecting the two objects , because one end of the separation of the binary , namely the secondary , can not be seen .",
    "the measures are made in the position of the primary with respect to unrelated reference objects ( e.g. quasars ) whose proper motion is either negligible or known .",
    "there are two major problems in determination of a binary orbit : ( 1 ) observational errors and ( 2 ) the conditional equations which connect the observable quantities with the orbital parameters .",
    "the conditional equations are not only non - linearly coupled but also transcendental because of kepler s equation ( e.g. , goldstein 1980 , danby 1988 , roy 1988 , murray and dermott 1999 , beutler 2004 ) .    as a method to determine the orbital elements of a binary , an analytic solution in an explicit form has been found by asada , akasaka and kasai ( 2004 , henceforth aak ) by assuming no observational errors .",
    "this solution is given in a closed form by requiring neither iterative nor numerical methods .",
    "the purpose of this brief article is to extend the aak solution considering observational data .",
    "we will summarize the aak solution in @xmath0 2 , next extend the solution considering observational data in @xmath0 3 , and make a computational test of the extended solution in @xmath0 4 .",
    "here we briefly summarize our notation and formulation for ideal cases without any observational error .",
    "we consider only the keplerian motion of a star around the common center of mass of a binary system by neglecting motions of the observer and the common center in our galaxy .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the cartesian coordinates on a celestial sphere .",
    "a general form of an ellipse on the celestial sphere is @xmath2 which is specified by five parameters @xmath3 since the center , the major / minor axes and the orientation of the ellipse are arbitrary . here",
    ", we should note that the origin of the coordinates is arbitrary in this paper , while it is taken at the position of the primary star in the case of resolved double stars ( for instance , aitken 1967 ) .",
    "at least five observations enable us to determine the parameters by using the least square method as @xmath4 where the location of the star on the celestial sphere at the time of @xmath5 for @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 . the inverse of a matrix in the l. h. s. exists uniquely .",
    "in some case such as a large observational error , however , the determinant of the matrix can become nearly zero .",
    "then , it would be more difficult to estimate the inverse matrix .",
    "the time interval between observations is denoted by @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "we choose the cartesian coordinates @xmath10 so that the observed ellipse given by eq .",
    "( @xmath11 ) can be reexpressed in the standard form as @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "there exists such a coordinate transformation as a combination of a translation and a rotation , which is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 is determined by @xmath21 then , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "it has been recently shown ( asada et al . 2004 ) that the orbital elements can be expressed explicitly as elementary functions of the locations of _ four _ observed points and their time intervals if astrometric measurements are done _ without _ any error .",
    "the key thing is that even after a keplerian orbit is projected onto the celestial sphere , the law of constant - areal velocity ( e.g. , goldstein 1980 , danby 1988 , roy 1988 , murray and dermott 1999 , beutler 2004 ) still holds , where the area is swept by the line interval between the star and the projected common center of mass but not a focus of the observed ellipse .",
    "for example , let us consider four observed points @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 . the location @xmath33 of the projected common center is given ( asada et al .",
    "2004 ) by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and the eccentric anomaly in the observed ellipse is given by @xmath36 . what eqs .",
    "( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) tell us is the relative position of the projected common center of mass with respect to the center of the observed ellipse , that is the origin of our coordinates system .",
    "if one wishes to take the origin of the coordinates as another point such as the location of the primary star , @xmath33 must be shifted by the displacement from the center of the observed ellipse to the new point .",
    "the above solution is generalized to determination of an open orbit ( asada 2006 ) .",
    "in reality , however , we have observational errors in each position measurement .",
    "we assume that these random errors obey the gaussian distribution .",
    "when the errors vanish , any set of four points @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 among observational data must satisfy eqs .",
    "( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) , if one replaces @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "all of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eqs .",
    "( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) have been determined up to this point and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the parameters to be estimated .",
    "we should note that eqs .",
    "( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) are _ linear _ in parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 to be determined by the least square method .",
    "hence , @xmath53 becomes square in @xmath51 and @xmath52 so that the extremum of @xmath53 can tell us @xmath54 where the summation is taken for every set of four points @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 with a correspondence as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 for defining @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 by eqs .",
    "( @xmath59)-(@xmath60 ) , and the number of all the combinations is @xmath61 . in practice , the number of summing , namely a denominator of eqs .",
    "( @xmath62 ) and ( @xmath63 ) , can be reduced significantly from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in the case of @xmath66 , if one considers only a set of four points as @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that each point @xmath69 appears only once in this case , and the reduction is useful when applied to a lot of data .",
    "the mapping between the observed ellipse and the keplerian orbit parameterized by the major axis @xmath70 and the ellipticity @xmath71 is specified by the inclination angle @xmath72 and the ascending node @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    given @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , one can analytically determine the remaining parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath70 and @xmath73 in order as ( asada et al .",
    "2004 ) @xmath74 where @xmath75",
    "in this section , we verify the present formula by numerical computations for various values of the orbital parameters . in order to make a verification , we assume random errors in measurements of positions of the star and show that the orbital parameters are reconstructed : first , we assume a keplerian orbit specified by @xmath70 and @xmath71 and a projection defined by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we prepare twenty seven sets of the parameters as @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 deg . and @xmath79 deg .",
    "for each test , we pick up twelve points in the original kepler orbit by assuming the same time interval between neighboring points for simplicity .",
    "next , for assumed @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we estimate the projected locations of the twelve points in the apparent ellipse plane . we add random errors to each point in order to imitate a `` measured position '' with observational errors ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in order to produce such a simulated data , we assume that the absolute standard deviation of the random error in the position measurement is 0.001 in the units of @xmath76 .",
    "we apply our formula to the simulated data in order to determine the orbital elements , and make a comparison between the assumed value and the retrieved one .",
    "table 1 shows a good agreement between them . for each parameter",
    "set , we perform a hundred of numerical runs for a statistical treatment .",
    "we define an error as the absolute standard deviation as @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the prime denotes values retrieved by using the present formula and the square bracket denotes a mean over each set . in table 1 , asterisk ( @xmath84 ) indicates that the formula does not always give a real value but a complex one .",
    "the case of complex numbers occurs because a large error in measurements of the positions in the apparent ellipse plane causes an anomaly in the apparent motion such as an apparent clockwise motion even if a true one is anti - clockwise .",
    "it is worthwhile to make a comment on table 1 : in the case of no inclination as @xmath85 , the ascending node does not exist , so that an error in retrieving @xmath73 can be apparently quite large , though it is harmless .",
    "in this paper , as a simplified method to determine a binary orbit , we extend the solution considering observational data . we expect that the present formula will be used for orbit determinations by some planned astrometric space missions such as sim ( shao 2004 ) , gaia ( mignard 2004 , perryman 2004 ) and jasmine ( gouda et al .",
    "2004 ) , which will observe with the accuracy of possibly a few micro arcseconds a number of binaries whose components are a visible star and a companion ranging from a black hole to an extra - solar planet .",
    "our numerical computations correspond to a case that by these missions we observe a binary system at a distance of 1 kpc from us , where the semimajor axis of the primary s orbit is around 1au .",
