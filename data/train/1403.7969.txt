    "simulations of the trapped ions dynamics are crucial in some experiments such as the experiment of the `` laboratoire de physique corpusculaire de caen ( lpc caen ) '' , where an open three - dimensional paul trap ( the lpctrap ) is used for the determination of the beta - neutrino angular correlation parameter @xcite .",
    "the error on this parameter depends on the spatial and velocity distributions of the trapped ions .",

    "it is made of six rings with an axis and a mid - plane of symmetry . in order to realize numerical simulations of our work",
    ", we use the simion software package @xcite which gives accurate results but needs long execution time specially for the systematic study of the behavior of tens of ions under the action of different trapping voltages .",
    "the trap is similar to the lpctrap @xcite .",
    "this last has been studied experimentally and with simulation at different occasions @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "mainly the ions spatial and velocity distributions , the mean ion s kinetic energy and the oscillation frequencies have been investigated . in a previous research work , we developed a numerical method to study the behavior of ions in an ideal paul trap @xcite .",
    "it is based on the power series solution of the differential equations @xcite .",
    "it gives accurate results in relatively small calculation time . in this work we present the extension of this method when higher order terms are present in the trapping potential .",
    "our results are compared to the simion simulations and to the results of the lpc caen .",

    "if we want to calculate the trajectory of an ion from @xmath95 to a relatively large time @xmath96 , a large value of @xmath94 is necessary .",
    "however , this will not work in practice because the processor will truncate the numbers when high powers of time or phase are calculated and gives wrong results .",

    "when we applied this method and solved numerically the equation of motion of an ion in an ideal paul trap @xcite , we found that @xmath107 and @xmath108 , give accurate results with a relatively small calculation time .",
    "the position and the velocity of the ion are calculated for @xmath109 means with a time step equal to @xmath110 of the rf period . in the following we use the same values for @xmath94 and @xmath98 .",

    ", @xmath40 was given positive @xcite .",
    "when using our convention , that means that it is in fact the absolute value of @xmath40 which was given .",
    "when simulating the ions behavior in the trap , we considered that an ion is trapped as long as it remains inside the effective trapping volume we define as @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "if at some time step , an ion does not fulfill these conditions , it is considered as lost and its trajectory is no longer calculated .",
    "for some of our simulations , we took for the ions uniform random initial positions inside the effective trapping volume .",
    "for the velocities we used what is known about the lpctrap to be as close as possible to the experiment .",
    "in fact , the ions kinetic energy distribution before the injection in the trap has been measured @xcite . it is a gaussian with the standard deviation @xmath139 .",
    "we then start by considering ions with random velocities following a maxwellian distribution with the temperature @xmath140 .",
    "@xmath141 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "however , most of the ions generated with these initial conditions are lost during the first microseconds of the trapping .",

    "similar to the motion in the @xmath8-direction , the rate of the increase of this phase shift is the smaller for the smallest oscillation amplitude .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that when the excursion of the ion is large , it enters in regions of space where terms in the potential of order higher than 10 , and which we do not include in our simulations , become important .",
    "these terms exist in simion and they give the difference between the results of the 2 methods ( simion and our method ) .",

    "the main advantage of our method is that it allows the calculation of an ion s trajectory in relatively short time . using a dell computer of @xmath174 frequency",
    ", we get the positions and velocities up to @xmath144 in less than @xmath175 while several minutes are needed by simion7 .",
    "our codes are written in the c language under windows and simion was used in its default computational quality .",
    "since we have similar oscillation amplitudes and frequencies when using our method and the simion software , we expect to get similar results with the 2 methods when considering the maximum excursion of the ions and their frequencies .",
    "the observed phase shift does not have an important effect .",
    "in order to get the first stability domain of the trap , we start by generating 500 ions of mass @xmath142 and charge @xmath143 . these are @xmath176 ions .",

    "the equations for @xmath81 and @xmath19 remain unchanged , while in the right side of the equation for @xmath8 the additional term @xmath286 appears with @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "to apply the power series method , the cosine function is replaced by its taylor expansion at each phase step @xmath289 with @xmath290 and @xmath46 being equal to @xmath291 for the @xmath292 step .",
    "this affects the recursion relation ( [ eq23 ] ) where the term @xmath293 has to be added to the expression of @xmath294 .    in the case of the lpctrap",
    ", the dipolar excitation has been realized by applying an additional voltage @xmath295 to one of the inner rings , r1 , and @xmath296 to the second one r2 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the tap is loaded with @xmath210 ions , the tickle is applied for @xmath297 with some frequency @xmath298 and then the number of the ions remaining in the trap is counted with an mcp detector .",
    "the operation is repeated for different @xmath298 . when there is no resonance , the number of the ions remaining in the trap is almost constant . at the resonance ,",
    "this numbers clearly decreases as is shown in figure [ fig.9](a ) .    to simulate the effect of such a field",
    ", we used simion7 to calculate the electric potential inside the trap when @xmath299 is applied to r1 and @xmath300 to r2 .",
    "these additional voltages , produce in the central region of the trap , an electric potential which can be approximated by a linear function of @xmath8 .",
    "the excitation is then mainly axial .",
    "the region where the potential has been calculated has @xmath301,@xmath302 and we used @xmath118 step for @xmath8 and @xmath15 .",
    "this potential has been fitted by the function @xmath303 .",
    "we find @xmath304 @xmath284 is equal to @xmath305 .    in order to approach the experimental conditions as well as possible",
    "we considered , besides the dipole excitation , also the cooling by buffer gas .",
    "every time step then , the collisions of every ion with the molecules of the buffer gas were implemented by monte carlo simulations according to the method described in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the buffer gas was hydrogen at @xmath211 and @xmath262 .    for the lpctrap",
    ", the tickle was applied for @xmath297 after the cooling of the ions by the buffer gas .",
    "the trapped ions are @xmath210 .",
    "the rf has @xmath306 amplitude and @xmath256 frequency @xcite .",
    "to simulate this , we start for this working point by considering the evolution of 500 ions up to @xmath260 under a hydrogen pressure of @xmath262 .",
    "the positions and the velocities of 100 of the remaining ions were stored and used as initial conditions for the simulation of the dipole excitation with the different tickle frequencies which has a constant amplitude of @xmath307 .",
    "we varied the tickle s frequency with a @xmath308 step and we counted the number of ions remaining in the trap after @xmath297 excitation .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig.9 ] ( b ) .     for @xmath309 and @xmath310 obtained from ref .",
    "( b ) * the simulated spectrum for the same conditions ]    fitting the resonance peaks with lorentzians , gives for the fundamental frequency @xmath311 .",
    "the experiment gives @xmath312 . in figure [ fig.9 ] ( b ) , the second peak has the frequency @xmath313 .",
    "the sum of the frequencies of the two peaks , i.e. @xmath314 , is almost equal to the frequency of the trapping field .",
    "we developed a method for the simulation of the dynamics of ions trapped in a paul trap with the presence of terms in the potential up to the order 10 .",
    "the equations of motions of the ions are solved numerically .",
    "every time step , the coordinates of the ion are represented by a 15 degree polynomials of time .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomials are determined by imposing the continuity of the position and the velocity and by using the power series method . when applied to particular cases ,",
    "the method gives oscillation amplitudes and frequencies close to those obtained by simion7 , however our calculations are much faster .",
    "the method was then applied to an existing trap .",
    "when knowing the coefficients of the trapping potential , we could consider the evolution of the position of hundreds of ions up to several tens of milliseconds .",
    "this is the time scale for the trap . by scanning the mathieu parameters and counting the number of ions remaining in the trap after 2 ms for every working point , we get the first stability domain which shows the nonlinear resonances .",
    "the buffer gas cooling is introduced by a monte carlo method where the hard sphere model is used , here again the results are close to the experimental ones and those obtained by simulations .    at the end we introduced a dipole excitation to ions cooled by the buffer gas .",
    "the results show good agreement with the experiment .",
