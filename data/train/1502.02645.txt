    "a 6d pes for formaldehyde was constructed earlier by zhang _",
    "@xcite , but it was developed for reactive scattering applications and consequently , limited attention was given to the long - range co - h@xmath0 van der waals configuration .",
    "therefore as a prerequisite to 6d inelastic dynamics studies , we carried out an unprecedented potential energy calculation including over 459,756 energy points ( see methods for details )",
    ". the potential energy data were then fit using the invariant polynomial method with morse - type variables in terms of bond - distances @xcite .",
    "the resulting 6d pes , referred to as v6d , is shown in fig .",
    "[ surface ] for one sample configuration .",
    "some features of v6d are also illustrated in supplementary figs .",
    "s2 - s4 .    * cross sections and rate coefficients .",
    "* time - independent quantum scattering calculations were performed using the cc formulation of arthurs and dalgarno @xcite as implemented for diatom - diatom collisions in the 4d rigid - rotor approximation in molscat @xcite and extended to full - dimensional dynamics as described by qumner , balakrishnan , and coworkers @xcite in twobc . in the first set of scattering calculations ,",
    "the new 6d pes was tested for pure rotational excitation from co(@xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "the crossed molecular beam experiment of antonova _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who obtained relative state - to - state rotational inelastic cross sections , is used as a benchmark .",
    "the experimental cross sections were determined at three center - of - mass kinetic energies ( 795 , 860 , and 991 @xmath7 ) , but with an initial state distribution of co estimated to be @xmath8% for @xmath9 and @xmath10% for @xmath11 .",
    "_ normalized the relative cross sections to rigid - rotor calculations done with molscat using the v04 pes of jankowski and szalewicz @xcite . comparison of the experiment with new 4d rigid - rotor calculations on v12 and full - dimensional calculations on v6d are shown in fig .",
    "[ ant - exp ] .",
    "we find no difference in the excitation cross sections when using v04 or v12 , while the rms cross section errors between the normalized experiment and the v12 and v6d calculations range from 0.56 - 0.89@xmath12 @xmath13 and 0.55 - 0.95@xmath12 @xmath14 , respectively ( see supplementary table s1 and supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "clearly , a 4d rigid - rotor treatment of the dynamics is sufficient for describing rotational excitation at these relatively high energies .",
    "the importance of full dimensionality for rotational excitation becomes more evident as the collision energy is reduced ( see also supplementary figs .",
    "s5 and s6 ) .",
    "low - energy excitation cross sections for the process @xmath15 or ( 0000)@xmath16(0100 ) , using the notation defined in methods , were measured by chefdeville _",
    "_ @xcite in a crossed - beam experiment .",
    "they obtained the excitation cross section for center of mass kinetic energies from 3.3 to 22.5 @xmath7 .",
    "though their energy resolution was limited , three broad features were detected near 6 , 13 , and 16 @xmath7 attributed to orbiting resonances . computed cross sections for process  ( [ eqrot ] ) using the 4d v12 pes and the full - dimensional v6d pes are presented in fig .",
    "[ gau - rigid]a .",
    "while both computations reveal numerous resonances , the resonances are generally shifted by 2 - 3 @xmath7 between calculations . the energy and magnitude of the resonances are very sensitive to the details of the pess , but differences may also be due to the relaxation of the rigid - rotor approximation with the use of v6d in twobc . in fig .",
    "3b , the two calculations are convolved over the experimental energy resolution and compared to the measured relative cross sections . except for the peak near 8 @xmath7",

    "rms errors are found to be 0.355 and 0.228@xmath12 @xmath13 for the v12 and v6d pess , respectively .",
    "further details on the rotational excitation calculations can be found in supplementary note 1 .",
    "now that the improved performance of the v6d potential for pure rotational excitation is apparent , we turn to rovibrational transitions .",

    "[ total - cross ] reveals a more than two orders of magnitude discrepancy among the various calculations .",
    "the large dispersion for the previous calculations is due to a combination of reduced dimensionality and decoupled angular momentum which makes it difficult to assess the reliability of each approximation .",
    "the current results , however , remove these uncertainties by utilizing i ) a full - dimensional ( 6d ) pes , ii ) full - dimensional ( 6d ) dynamics , and iii ) full angular - momentum coupling . the sharp peaks in the cross sections over the 1 - 10 @xmath7 range in the 6d / cc results are due to resonances @xcite supported by the co - h@xmath0 van der waals potential well .",
    "these resonances , in the rovibrational quenching of co by h@xmath0 , are reported here for the first time and their prediction is made possible through our high - level treatment of the dynamics .",

    "[ total - rate ] to total deexcitation measurements @xcite reported by reid _ et al .",
    "the comparison is not straight - forward because i ) the measurements correspond to an initial thermal population of h@xmath0 rotational states , ii ) the initial rotational population of co(@xmath24 ) was unknown , iii ) the experimental rate coefficients for ortho - h@xmath0 are estimated from para- and normal - h@xmath0 measurements , and iv ) the contribution from a quasi - resonant channel , @xmath25 dominates the para - h@xmath0 case for @xmath26  k. fig .",
    "[ total - rate]a displays the co(@xmath2 ) rovibrational deexcitation rate coefficients from the current 6d / cc calculations for collisions of ortho - h@xmath0 for @xmath22=1 and 3 , separately .",
    "these rate coefficients are summed over all @xmath27 and @xmath28=1 , 3 , and 5 . assuming a boltzmann average at the kinetic temperature @xmath29 of the h@xmath0 rotational levels @xmath22 = 1 and 3 , presumed to be representative of the experimental conditions , rate coefficients are computed and found to be in good agreement with the measurements above 200  k. from fig .",
    "[ total - rate]a , the contribution from @xmath22=3 is seen to be only important above 150 k. the remaining difference with experiment at low temperatures may be due to the fact mentioned above that the ortho - h@xmath0 rate coefficients are not directly measured , but deduced from normal - h@xmath0 and para - h@xmath0 experiments . in particular , reid _",
    "assume that the ortho / para ratio in the normal - h@xmath0 measurements is 3:1 , i.e. statistical , and independent of temperature .",
    "further , as stated above , the experimental co rotational population distribution in @xmath2 is unknown . nevertheless , the current 6d / cc computations are a significant advance over the 4d results of reid _ et al . _ which also correspond to a boltzmann average of rate coefficients for @xmath22=1 and 3 .",
    "as indicated above , the situation for para - h@xmath0 collisions is more complicated due to the quasi - resonant contribution ( [ qr ] ) , a mechanism not important for ortho - h@xmath0 .",
    "boltzmann - averaged rate coefficients are presented in fig .",
    "[ total - rate]b including @xmath22=0 and 2 summed over @xmath28= 0 , 2 , and 4 , with and without the quasi - resonant contribution , @xmath30 . while the current 6d / cc results and the 4d calculations of reid _ et al .",
    "_ are in agreement that the quasi - resonant contribution becomes important for @xmath26  k , the relative magnitude compared to the non - resonant transitions from the 6d / cc calculation is somewhat less than obtained previously with the 4d potential .",
    "this is partly related to the fact that the 6d / cc rate coefficients for @xmath22=0 are significantly larger than those of reid _ et al .",
    "_ ( see also the corresponding cross sections in fig .",
    "[ total - cross ] and in the supplementary fig .",
    "s9 ) . compared to the experiment , we obtain excellent agreement for @xmath31  k , but are somewhat smaller at higher temperatures .",
    "this small discrepancy may be related to the unknown co(@xmath24 ) rotational population in the measurement .",
    "nevertheless , it is only the 6d / cc computations , i.e. , dynamics in full dimensionality with full angular momentum coupling , which can reproduce the measurements for both ortho- and para - h@xmath0 .",
    "further , the computations for the quasi - resonant process ( 2 ) were the most challenging reported here due to the requirement of a very large basis set ( see supplementary table s2 ) which resulted in long computation times , a large number of channels , and usage of significant disk space ( @xmath30.5 tb per partial wave ) . in total",
    ", the cross sections given here consumed @xmath3240,000 cpu hours .",
    "the current investigation of the co - h@xmath0 inelastic collision system has been performed with the intent of minimal approximation through the computation of a high - level potential energy surface , robust surface fitting , and full - dimensional inelastic dynamics with full angular - momentum coupling .",
    "that is , within this paradigm for studying inelastic dynamics , we have advanced the state - of - the - art for diatom - diatom collisions through this unprecedented series of computations .",
    "the approach has been benchmarked against experiment for pure rotational and rovibrational transitions giving the most accurate results to date within the experimental uncertainties and unknowns .",
    "the accuracy and long - range behavior of the 6d potential energy surface is found to be comparable to previous , lower - dimensional surfaces .",
    "the agreement of the current computation for the co(@xmath2 ) rovibrational quenching with measurement resolves a long - standing ( more than two decades ) discrepancy and justifies the requirement of a full - dimensional approach .",
    "this methodology can now , though with significant computational cost , be applied to a large range of initial rotational levels for @xmath2 and for higher vibrational excitation to compute detailed state - to - state cross sections unobtainable via experiment .",
    "this advance in computational inelastic scattering is particularly timely as ground - based ( e.g. , the very large telescope ( vlt ) ) observations have focused on co rovibrational emission / absorption in a variety of astrophysical objects , while related observations are in the planning stages for future space - based telescopes ( e.g. , nasa s _ james webb space telescope _ ) . in particular , we are in an exciting era of investigation into the properties of protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) around young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "ppds provide the material for newly - forming stars and fledgling planets .",
    "the co fundamental band ( @xmath33 ) is a tracer of warm gas in the inner regions of ppds and , with appropriate modeling , gives insight into disk - gas kinematics and disk evolution in that zone where planets are expected to be forming . a recent survey of 69 ppds with the vlt @xcite detected co vibrational bands in 77% of the sources including @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and even @xmath37 in a few cases .",
    "remarkably , rotational excitation as high as @xmath38 was observed .",
    "however , the modeling of ppds , and other astrophysical sources with co vibrational excitation , is hindered by the lack of rate coefficients due to h@xmath0 collisions .",
    "we are now in an excellent position to provide full - dimensional , state - to - state co - h@xmath0 collisional data which will not only have a profound impact on models characterizing these intriguing environments that give birth to planets , but also aid in critiquing current theories used to describe their evolution .",

    "<S> quantum mechanical studies of inelastic processes in molecular collisions began with the development of the nearly - exact , close - coupling ( cc ) method for rotational transitions in atom - diatom collisions by arthurs and dalgarno @xcite and takayanagi @xcite in the 1960s . </S>",
    "<S> over the past five decades tremendous advances in computational processing power and numerical algorithms have allowed high - level computations of inelastic processes @xcite as well as reactive collisional dynamics of large molecular systems , the latter using primarily time - dependent approaches @xcite . until recently , however , the largest full - dimensional inelastic studies for a system of two colliding molecules have been limited to h@xmath0-h@xmath0 collisions in six - dimensions ( 6d ) , which were performed with both time - independent @xcite and time - dependent @xcite approaches for solving the schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> however , to make these computations possible , the authors resorted to various angular - momentum decoupling approximations with uncertain reliability . </S>",
    "<S> it was only recently  @xcite that these decoupling approximations were relaxed and essentially exact full - dimensional cc computations for the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 system became feasible . despite the large internal energy spacing of h@xmath0 , which allows the basis sets to be relatively compact , these calculations are computationally demanding . replacing one h@xmath0 molecule with a molecule that has smaller internal energy spacing , such as carbon monoxide , </S>",

    "<S> this was made possible through the accurate computation and precise fitting of a 6d co - h@xmath0 potential energy surface ( pes ) in the relevant region of the formaldehyde tetra - atomic system and the further development of the inelastic diatom - diatom time - independent scattering code , twobc @xcite , which performs full angular - momentum coupling , the cc formalism @xcite , including vibrational degrees - of - freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we first briefly describe the new co - h@xmath0 pes and its testing through comparison of rotational excitation calculations using the 6d pes and 4d pess ( neglecting vibrational motion ) and available experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the full - dimensional ( 6d ) , essentially exact , computations for rovibrational quenching of co(@xmath2 ) due to h@xmath0 collisions are presented resolving a two - orders - of - magnitude discrepancy between earlier 4d calculations which adopted various approximations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the current results are consistent with the rovibrational quenching measurements for the co - h@xmath0 system , performed at the oxford physical chemistry laboratory from 1976 - 1993 , which no prior calculation has yet been able to adequately explain @xcite . </S>"
