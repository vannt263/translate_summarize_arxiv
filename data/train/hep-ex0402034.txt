    "the @xmath2 meson is interpreted as a bound state of a charmed quark and charmed antiquark ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the decay process @xmath0 is an octet - baryon - pair decay mode that has been measured by dm2  @xcite , dasp  @xcite , mark i  @xcite , mark ii  @xcite and mark iii  @xcite .",
    "in general , the angular distribution of @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angle between the direction of the omitting baryon and the @xmath12 beam direction .",
    "different theoretical models based on first - order qcd give different predictions for the value of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "brodsky and lepage  @xcite assumed that the reaction is a process in the asymptotic region where all quark and baryon masses can be neglected .",
    "claudson , glashow , and wise  @xcite included the baryon masses in their calculation , which significantly changed the previous prediction .",

    "the branching ratio and corresponding angular distribution will provide some insight into the details of the baryon structure  @xcite .",
    "chernyak and zhitnitsky  @xcite have investigated qcd sum rules for nucleon wave functions and calculated the branching ratio of the discussed decay in terms of the wave function .",

    "the measurements are based on an analysis of 57.7@xmath16  @xciteevents registered in the besii detector at bepc .",
    "besii is a large solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that is described in ref .",
    "charged particle momenta are determined with a resolution of @xmath17=@xmath18 @xmath19 in a 40-layer cylindrical main drift chamber(mdc ) .",
    "particle identification is accomplished by specific ionization ( @xmath20 ) measurements in the drift chamber and time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements in a barrel - like array of 48 scintillation counters .",
    "the @xmath20 resolution is @xmath21 ; the tof resolution for bhabha events is @xmath22 ps .",
    "these two systems independently provide more than @xmath23 separation of protons from any other charged particle species for the momentum range relevant to @xmath0 decays .",
    "radially outside of the tof counters is a 12-radiation - length barrel shower counter ( bsc ) comprised of gas proportional tubes interleaved with lead sheets .",
    "the bsc measures the energies and directions of photons with resolution of @xmath24 , @xmath25 mrad , and @xmath26 cm .",
    "the iron flux return of the magnet is instrumented with three double layers of counters that are used to identify muon .    in this analysis , a geant3 based monte carlo package(simbes ) with detailed consideration of the detector performance ( such as dead electronics channels )",
    "the consistency between data and monte carlo has been carefully checked in many high purity physics channels , and the agreement is reasonable .",
    "events are selected with two and only two well reconstructed and oppositely charged tracks .",
    "the polar angle of the track , @xmath27 , is required to be in the range @xmath28 . in order to remove the cosmic rays , the difference of the flying time between the positive and negative track , @xmath29 ,",
    "is required to be less than 4.0 ns .",
    "information from the tof system is used to identify protons .",
    "both tracks are required to be not identified as a @xmath30 or a @xmath31 by the tof , @xmath32 the measured flying time and the expected flying time assuming the track to be proton , pion , or kaon should satisfy the following requirement , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . meanwhile , since @xmath0 is a two - body decay , the @xmath35 pairs are back - to - back ; we require the two - track opening angle to be larger than @xmath36 .",
    "finally , for both tracks , the absolute difference between the measured momentum and its expected value , 1.232 gev / c , is required to be less than 110 mev / c .",

    "this study indicates that there is little background for high momentum values , but some at lower momenta , as can be seen in fig .",

    "the total background level for these events surviving the @xmath51 event selection criteria is about @xmath52 .",
    "since the background level is very small , we do not subtract the background but use @xmath39 as the uncertainty of the background in the branching ratio measurement .",
    "since there are imperfections in monte carlo simulation , particularly when it simulates the tail of momentum resolution and tof resolution , which will affect the efficiencies of momentum cuts and particle i d . in order to reduce systematic error as much as possible , the correction on mc efficiency is needed .",
    "since both momentum resolution and tof resolution are @xmath53 dependent , when we put cuts on momentum and tof , the efficiency will depend on the angle @xmath27 .",
    "a reweighting method is used to do the efficiency correction .",
    "we define a @xmath53 dependent weight factor ( or correction factor ) @xmath54 as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 represents the @xmath56th selection requirement , @xmath27 is the polar angle of @xmath57 or @xmath58 , and @xmath59 stands for efficiency .",
    "when the weight functions are obtained , phase space mc generator is used and 500,000 events are generated . since the weight is obtained in each small bin of @xmath53 , the weight function will not depend very much on the actual angular distribution of generated events . to determine the weight for a given variable , the other ,",
    "uncorrelated requirements are made more stringent to provide a pure sample .",
    "when the correlation among different selection criteria is so small that it can be ignored , the efficiency of the data can be expressed by the reweighted mc efficiency as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the part of the efficiency which is not corrected ; it is due to track reconstruction , geometry acceptance , etc , and its uncertainty can be determined using another method(see sec .",
    "[ secsyst ] below ) .",

    "with @xmath68 denoting to the efficiency obtained from monte carlo and @xmath69 for the total correction function of the efficiency , we fit the angular distribution of the data with the function @xmath70 , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant .",

    "when the fit parameters of the weight curve are changed by @xmath82 , the fitted value for @xmath7 changes by 2.6@xmath43 .",
    "this is taken as a systematic error .",
    "another systematic error from tracking reconstrucion is determined by using different mdc wire resolution models in the mc simulations .",
    "this affects the @xmath7 value by 5.2@xmath43 . from a @xmath57,@xmath73 momentum sideband study , the uncertainty from background , including background level and background shape , is estimated to be 2.2@xmath43 .",
    "the uncertainties from other sources such as from the fitting function of @xmath68 are negligible . adding these contributions in quadrature gives a total effect about 6.2@xmath43 , i.e. @xmath83 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "systematic errors on the branching ratio measurement mainly come from mc statistics , the efficiency uncertainties of the particle i d , the momentum selection , the mdc wire resolution , the uncertainty in @xmath7 , uncertainties in the background level , and the total number of @xmath2 events .",
