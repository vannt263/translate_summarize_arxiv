    "with the commissioning of both wide field spectroscopic survey instruments ( 2df , colless et al .",
    "2001 ; sdss , york et al . 2000 ) and of deep multi - aperture spectroscopy on large aperture telescopes ( e.g. deep survey , davis et al .",
    "2003 , virmos - vlt deep survey , le fvre et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is becoming increasingly important to reliably extract information concerning the stellar populations in galaxies from their integrated spectra .",
    "stellar population synthesis ( sps ) provides the only tool to estimate the ages and metal abundances of stellar populations in distant , unresolved galaxies .",
    "the application of sps models to the study of unresolved systems , however , needs to be preceded by extensive and detailed testing against the observations of nearby , resolved systems , for which the key stellar population ( sp ) parameters , such as age , metal abundances ( i.e. , metallicities and abundance ratios ) and initial mass function ( imf ) are known independently . to gain confidence that modelling of the integrated spectra of galaxies is sufficiently reliable to extract useful information about their luminosity - weighted mean ages and chemical compositions",
    ", it is often proposed that integrated light observations of star clusters should be used as a testing ground for the evolutionary synthesis models that form the backbone of integrated light analysis .",
    "recently , different groups have pursued this aim , by comparing sps model predictions to the observations of globular clusters with a range of sp parameters ( leonardi & rose 2003 , maraston et al .",
    "2003 , beasley , hoyle & sharples 2002 , puzia et al .",
    "2002 , schiavon et al .",
    "2002a , b ) .    given the extensive evidence in recent work that the integrated light of early - type galaxies is often dominated by intermediate - age stellar populations ( e.g. , trager et al . 2000 , kuntschner 2000 , caldwell , rose & concannon 2003 ) , it has become of fundamental importance that sps models be tested in the regime of intermediate age ( @xmath5 4 gyr ) and solar metallicity . moreover , this is the range of sp parameters expected in early - type galaxies at moderately high redshifts ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "most of the previous studies , however , have concentrated on galactic globular clusters , thus being limited to ages older than @xmath5 10 gyr .",
    "more recently leonardi & rose ( 2003 ) and beasley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have extended sps model calibration efforts to younger ages by comparing model predictions to observations of clusters from the large magellanic cloud . in general , good consistency was found between sps ages and metallicities and those from the literature .",
    "however , the quality of cluster cmds for age determinations , as well as the variety of isochrones used in the literature , make the precision and homogeneity of cmd ages for lmc clusters quite low , compared with what can be achieved with galactic clusters . moreover , it is difficult to check the metallicity scale of sp models using lmc clusters because they lack reliable metallicity determinations based on classical abundance analysis of high resolution spectra of stellar members . to this date ,",
    "such conditions are met only for galactic clusters , which makes them the ideal templates for the calibration of sp models .    in order to cure this deficiency",
    ", we constructed an integrated spectrum of m67 , an old ( @xmath5 4 gyr ) galactic open cluster with solar metallicity .",
    "the latter spectrum is used as a template for the calibration of the sps models in the regime of intermediate age and solar metallicity .",
    "our integrated spectrum was constructed by observing individual bona fide cluster members and coadding their spectra weighting according to their magnitudes and an assumed imf .",
    "we present a detailed comparison of our sps models to the above integrated spectrum of m67 .",
    "we find that our model spectroscopic ages based on all balmer lines from @xmath1 through @xmath3 agree with the cmd - based cluster age to within 0.5 gyr .",
    "we also verify whether the models correctly predict elemental abundances from integrated spectra , by comparing to the well known abundances of m67 stars , taken from the literature .",
    "again , our models pass the test by predicting correctly the abundances of key elements , like magnesium , carbon and nitrogen .",
    "our spectrum of m67 is also compared with an integrated spectrum of the central 3  of m32 , obtained with the same instrumental setup .",
    "we find that the two spectra look remarkably alike , indicating that the luminosity - weighted age and metal abundances of m32 are likely to be very close to those of m67 .",
    "the above results encouraged us to compare our model predictions to the integrated spectrum of another benchmark of stellar population studies , the compact elliptical galaxy m32 .",
    "the resulting spectroscopic age is somewhere between 2 and 3.5 gyr , depending on the balmer line adopted in the analysis .",
    "also depending on the iron feature used , the mean iron abundance of m32 results slightly above solar , or strongly super - solar .",
    "analysis of other features , like mgb and cn bands , shows that magnesium is underabundant relative to iron in the center of m32 , while carbon and nitrogen have about solar abundance ratios relative to iron .    in section 2",
    "we describe the selection of our sample of m67 members and the observations . in section 3",
    "we describe the computation of the integrated spectrum of m67 . in section 4 ,",
    "a brief description of the models is presented , and they are compared with both the cmd and the integrated spectrum of m67 . the analysis of the integrated spectrum of m32 is presented in section 5 , and in section 6 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "to obtain a representative integrated spectrum of m67 built up from observations of individual stars in the cluster , spectra and photometry covering the entire cmd from the tip of the giant branch through the lower main sequence are required .",
    "included as well must be giant branch ( gb ) `` clump '' stars , i.e. , the core helium burning phase , as well as blue straggler ( bs ) stars . as a starting point , we used the cmd of montgomery , marschall , & janes ( 1993 ; hereafter mmj ) to produce a candidate list of 103 stars covering the cmd from the tip of the giant branch down to 1.5 mag below the main sequence turnoff ( msto , v@xmath514 ) , as well as several gb clump stars and a number of bs stars .",
    "the stars were selected for observation strictly on the basis of their positions in the cmd .",
    "the cutoff at the fainter ms magnitudes is imposed by the combination of required spectral resolution and s / n ratio . as decribed below",
    ", we filled in the lower ms with observations of solar - abundance field dwarfs .",
    "naturally , there will be interlopers potentially contaminating the true m67 cluster members .",
    "we use four methods to filter out such interlopers .",
    "the first is to search for proper motion non - members , based on the study carried out by sanders ( 1977 ) .",
    "we find 16 stars in our sample with a proper - motion membership probability of 30% or less .",
    "a second criterion is radial velocity .",
    "in addition to our own velocities , which have a 1-@xmath7 accuracy of @xmath8 km / s , many of our stars are observed by either mathieu et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , with a precision of better than 1 km / s , and by scott , friel , & janes ( 1995 ) , with a precision similar to ours .",
    "we find that 13 stars have radial velocities inconsistent with membership in m67 ; six of these stars overlap with the proper motion non - members .",
    "a third way to discover non - members is if the metal - abundance of the star is inconsistent with the near - solar composition of m67 .",
    "specifically , the msto color of m67 is similar to that of the galactic thick disk population ( carney , latham & laird 1989 ; gilmore , wyse & jones 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , m67 is located approximately 0.5 kpc above the galactic plane , and thus at the distance where one can expect significant contamination from the thick disk msto . to identify thick disk msto stars",
    ", we measure the lick fe5270 and h@xmath9 indices ( worthey et al . 1994 ) for all of the stars in our sample , then find a mean relation between fe5270 and h@xmath9 .",
    "stars that deviate by more than 0.4   in fe5270 , for their h@xmath9 , are deemed to be metal - weak , with the threshold at 0.4 determined from the fit to h@xmath9 versus [ fe / h ] given in worthey et al .",
    "altogether we find six stars in the m67 turnoff region which are metal - poor .",
    "five of these stars are proper motion non - members , and three of the stars are further confirmed as radial velocity non - members . given that the majority of stars in our list are indeed cluster members , it is suggestive that the proper motion and radial velocity non - members that we find in the turnoff region are also systematically metal - poor . thus we conclude that there is significant contamination of the observed cmd of m67 with thick disk turnoff stars .    a fourth way to detect non - members",
    "is by identifying stars with anomalous positions in the m67 cmd based on their inferred absolute v magnitude , assuming membership in m67 , and comparing to distances inferred from their surface gravities . here",
    "we make use of a pair of spectral indices , sr  ii@xmath10/fe  i@xmath11 and @xmath3/fe  i@xmath11 , that have been utilized by rose ( 1984 ; 1985a , b ) to discriminate surface gravity in stars . briefly",
    ", the method relies on the gravity sensitivity of the ionization balance between singly ionized strontium and neutral iron , with the temperature sensitivity moderated by the strength of @xmath3 . using this procedure",
    "we find five stars with anomalous cmd positions , three of which are proper motion and/or radial velocity non - members as well .",
    "the five cases are as follows .",
    "the star mmj6496 is positioned at v=11.26 and @xmath12=0.62 in the cmd , thus is located at low surface gravity if it is indeed a member of m67 , and at an unusual location , i.e. , well above the msto , but too red for a bs star .",
    "however , the surface gravity determined from the sr  ii@xmath10/fe  i@xmath11 index indicates that it is a dwarf , and its fe5270 index indicates solar composition .",
    "thus it appears to be a relatively nearby ( @xmath5 200 pc away ) solar composition thin disk dwarf .",
    "the star mmj5336 has v=12.96 , @xmath12=1.11 , placing it in an anomalously red region of the bottom of the sgb .",
    "its spectral characteristis are all consistent with a cool thick disk ( i.e. , metal - poor ) giant .",
    "the star mmj6034 has similar characteristics to mmj5336 .",
    "in contrast , the stars mmj5571 and mmj5688 have the problem of lying blueward in color of the msto .",
    "mmj5571 has v=12.65 and @xmath12=0.52 , while mmj5688 has v=12.89 and @xmath12=0.45 . for both of these stars the sr",
    "ii@xmath13/fe  i@xmath11 index indicates low surface gravity .",
    "we have summarized the case for the non - member stars in table [ nonmembers ] , where stellar ids ( following the nomenclature of mmj ) , coordinates , magnitudes and colors are listed together with the criteria used to decide the non - membership of each star . in table",
    "[ members_tab ] we list the stars found to be members of m67 , which were used to construct the integrated spectrum of the cluster . in figure",
    "[ targets ] we display the m67 bona fide member stars in the color - magnitude diagram .",

    "the latter were computed using the hipparcos parallaxes of the field stars and the distance modulus of the cluster , discussed in section [ cmdage ] .      due to the decreasing lifetime",
    "as a star ascends the gb , representation of the upper gb of m67 is sparse .",
    "to remedy this situation , we have observed a number of cool field m giants , which were selected among stars from the jones ( 1999 ) spectral library , on the basis of the strength of tio bands in their spectra .",

    "the standard recipe for this calibration has been described in detail by worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) .",
    "it consists of collecting spectra of lick / ids standards ( worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) , smoothing those spectra to the lick / ids resolution ( given by worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) , and comparing the ews measured in the smoothed spectra with the standard values . in figure [ calib ]",

    "our measurements are generally in good agreement with the standard values for most of the indices . for some indices",
    "we find a systematic trend of the residuals as a function of index strength .",
    "the most obvious case is that of ca4227 , but slight trends can also be seen for @xmath16 , g4300 , fe4383 and @xmath17 .",
    "the errors in our index values were estimated from measurements made on 20 repeat spectra taken for 7 lick standards . in all cases",

    "we will henceforth base our errorbars on the _ r.m.s .",
    "_ scatter between our data for lick standards and the standard values ( figure [ calib ] ) .",
    "a key aspect of such calibrations is that the calibrating standards must encompass the range of ews characteristic of the target systems , otherwise systematic effects such as that seen in figure [ calib ] can not be adequately accounted for , possibly resulting in large errors . for this reason , we indicate by arrows in figure [ calib ] the index values measured in the spectra of the two targets of our analysis , m67 and m32 .    for the indices not exhibiting any slope as a function of index strength , only minor zero point corrections were sufficient to bring our measurements to the lick / ids system . that was the case for cn1 , cn2 , @xmath18 , @xmath1 , mg @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath17 .",
    "for the remaining indices , the zeropoint corrections were computed as the average value in a @xmath5 2 @xmath14-wide window around the values measured for m67 and m32 ( 0.1 mag in the case of cn1 , cn2 and @xmath17 ) . on average ,",
    "15 stars were used in computing the zeropoint corrections .",
    "we note that the index values for m67 and m32 are in regions of the index space that are very well populated by standard stars , so that we consider our calibration onto the lick / ids system to be robust .",

    "are slightly less affected , but the case of the g band ( g4300 ) is especially delicate . there is a sharp decline of the residuals for ews larger than @xmath24 , and as a result , if we had adopted a zeropoint correction considering all the calibrating standards , the g4300-based spectroscopic age of m67 would be 2 gyr older ( see discussion in section [ agesect ] ) .    in appendix",
    "a we provide a table with lick / ids index measurements taken in the spectra of all the field and m67 stars observed in this work .",

    "the integrated spectrum of the cluster is given by the following expression    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the flux - calibrated spectrum of the _ i - th _ star and @xmath27 is its @xmath28 magnitude taken from the montgomery et al .",
    "( 1993 ) photometry .",
    "the magnitudes were corrected for interstellar reddening assuming @xmath29 = 0.05 .",
    "@xmath30 is a magnitude measured in the observed spectrum by integrating it with a @xmath28-filter transmittance curve taken from lejeune , cuisinier & buser ( 1997 ) .",

    "the quantity @xmath31 is proportional to the number of stars at each evolutionary stage .",
    "for all the stars from the main sequence to the tip of the first - ascent giant branch , @xmath31 was computed assuming a power - law imf , normalized such that the total mass of the system is equal to 1 @xmath32 . for horizontal branch stars and blue stragglers",
    ", we followed a different procedure as explained a few paragraphs below .    in order to compute @xmath31",
    ", we need to estimate the stellar masses .",
    "this was achieved by interpolating stellar colors or magnitudes in a theoretical isochrone for solar metallicity and an age of 4 gyr .",
    "the isochrone was truncated at the tip of the first - ascent giant branch .",
    "this procedure was followed for all stars except the m giants ( @xmath33 @xmath34k ) .",
    "the stars are then sorted according to their masses so that the weight for each star was given by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the mass of the @xmath37-th star , @xmath38 is the imf exponent , and @xmath39 , so that the mass bin occupied by the @xmath37-th star is given by    @xmath40    we adopt a salpeter imf , with @xmath41 .",
    "it can be seen that the weight is higher for lower mass stars , and higher for larger @xmath42 .",
    "the latter means that an individual star in a more densely populated region of the cmd of figure [ targets ] has a lower weight in the final spectrum because the mass bin occupied by it is narrower . along the giant branch ,",
    "the mass varies by just a tiny fraction so that ultimately the weight for each star is mostly dependent on @xmath42 .",
    "this is important for the reasons discussed in section [ contm ]    for blue stragglers and horizontal - branch stars , @xmath31 was computed from the observed numbers relative to main sequence stars in the range @xmath43 as given by the color - magnitude diagrams of fan et al .",

    "they interpret this result as evidence that the cluster has undergone evaporation of low - mass stars .",
    "we tested our computations for the effect of the power - law exponent and found that both the overall spectral shape and the absorption line ews remain virtually constant even for wide variations of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , throughout this paper we adopt a single - exponent salpeter imf because our interest is in using m67 as a template single stellar population , free of the effects of dynamical evolution .",
    "the assumed value for the reddening towards the cluster has a small impact in the computed integrated spectrum .",
    "this effect has been discussed by schiavon et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "it is due to the fact that a variation in @xmath29 implies a change in the inferred absolute magnitudes of the stars , which in turn affect the computed stellar masses , and thus the relative weights given to each star in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the effect is small , and is indicated in figures [ ind1 ] and [ ind2 ] in the form of arrows .      for the m giants ,",
    "the optical colors can not be used for mass estimation for two reasons : m giants are strongly variable , and optical colors saturate for temperatures below 4000k .",
    "the strong variability implies that a given m giant spectrum might not correspond to a measured color if they have not been collected at approximately the same time . on the other hand ,",
    "saturation makes it difficult to use optical colors to get masses through interpolation in the isochrones .",
    "a good example is given by the pair of field stars hd94705",
    "( m5.5iii ) and hd62721 ( k4iii ) .",
    "their @xmath12s are 1.46 and 1.53 respectively , but the effective temperatures inferred from the strength of the tio bands in their spectra are @xmath5 3400 and 3900 k respectively . if their colors were used to estimate their masses , and thence their weighting factors in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , a large error would result in the case of hd94705 , because being cooler it represents a later , less populated evolutionary stage than hd62721 .",
    "our procedure was to estimate the @xmath33s of all stars redder than @xmath46 from the strength of their tio bands , using an empirical calibration derived from measurements in the spectra of lick standards whose @xmath33s were determined from angular diameter measurements or the infrared flux method ( schiavon 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "the @xmath33s so derived are listed in table [ tbl - tef ] .",
    "they were used to estimate stellar masses and colors for stars cooler than @xmath5 4000k , through interpolation in the theoretical isochrone for 3.5 gyr and [ fe / h]=0.0 .",
    "the weights of the m giants resulting from this procedure were substantially higher than when the masses were interpolated from their @xmath12s , because there are only four m giants in our sample , and therefore each of these stars occupies a wide mass bin ( equations [ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] ) . as a result , when the m giants are accounted in this way , the strength of the redder indices , especially mg @xmath19 , becomes considerably stronger .",

    "hurley et al . ( 2001 ) , using binary population synthesis and n - body simulations , propose that the high bs fraction in m67 is due to a combination of effects related to binary evolution , stellar encounters in the cluster high density environment , and evaporation of low - mass stars .",
    "irrespective of the physical origin of the bs phenomenon , their mere existence is a potential source of confusion for those attempting to use balmer lines to date stellar populations , as is clearly illustrated by the strength of balmer lines when bs are included in the integrated spectrum ( figure [ specbs ] ) .",
    "in fact , we show in section [ compsp ] that the age one would infer from the integrated spectrum of m67 when blue stragglers are included is substantially lower ( @xmath5 1.2 gyr ) .",
    "however , the case of m67 seems to be exceedingly unusual . as noted by landsman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the central stellar density in the cluster is higher than that found in the centers of most nearby galaxies .    there is another reason to believe that such a high bs contribution does not seem to be a common phenomenon in the universe , and in particular in early - type galaxies , which are the ultimate targets of our modelling efforts .",
    "when blue stragglers are included , the integrated spectrum of m67 has strong enough balmer lines that it would be classified as a _ k+a / a+k _ spectrum according to the definition of several different groups ( fisher et al .",

    "even though such consistency should in principle be expected , we note that previous studies found huge discrepancies between cmd - based and spectroscopic ages for a well - known galactic globular cluster , 47 tuc .",

    "the remaining age indicator , the g band ( g4300 ) presents a trend as a function of age which is opposite to that of balmer lines : it gets weaker for younger ages .",
    "this is due to the fact that it is much stronger in giants than in turnoff stars . as a result",

    "the mismatch between the model for [ fe / h]=0.0 and age = 3.5 gyr is such that it could be explained by m67 having a higher than solar [ c / fe ] .",
    "however , abundance studies of m67 turnoff stars point at a different direction : they have nearly solar [ c / fe ] , and may even perhaps be a little carbon - poor ( see discussion in section [ metsect ] ) .    therefore , it is quite puzzling that in the m67 integrated spectrum the g band is stronger than in the model for 3.5 gyr and solar metallicity .",
    "we tried removing stars very deviant from the average relation between the ew of the g band and color , but that did not remove the discrepancy .",
    "we showed in section [ conver ] that the calibration of our g band measurements into the lick / ids system was somewhat uncertain .",
    "we thus believe that calibration uncertainties related to the conversion into the lick / ids equivalent width system are responsible for this mismatch .    in section [ contm ] , we corrected our model predictions for the effect of agb stars , by adding an extra 0.1 dex in the luminosity function of the upper giant branch . in their analysis of the integrated spectrum of 47 tuc , schiavon et al .",
    "( 2002b ) showed that an error of @xmath0 0.1 dex in the luminosity function of giants brighter than the horizontal branch translates into an error of @xmath0 1 gyr in the spectroscopic age inferred from balmer lines .",
    "the latter result is valid for an old stellar population ( @xmath5 11 gyr ) with [ fe / h]=0.7 .",
    "for a younger and more metal - rich stellar population , we expect the effect to be less important , given that the total contribution by cool giants to the optical integrated light of metal - rich sps with intermediate ages is lower .",
    "in fact , we note that the integrated spectrum of m67 is little affected by uncertaintities in the lf of the upper giant branch : the change in the m67 indices in figures [ ind1 ] and [ ind2 ] that would be generated by a 0.1 dex variation in the lf above the horizontal branch is in all cases smaller than the symbol size .    in summary , we achieve excellent consistency for m67 between the spectroscopic ages inferred from all balmer lines studied .",
    "we attribute the mismatch with the spectroscopic age inferred from the g band to uncertainties in the calibration of the latter .",
    "figures [ ind1 ] and [ ind2 ] also allow checking the consistency of sp model predictions with the known elemental abundances of m67 .",
    "this is a unique opportunity , because m67 stars have been the subject of many abundance analyses by different groups , so that it can be fairly said that the abundance pattern of the cluster is well known .",
    "the importance of enforcing consistency between sp models and the results of classical stellar abundance analyses lies in the fact that the latter provide the only physically meaningful measurement of the abundances of heavy elements in stars .",

    "the abundances of these elements are very important because they affect significantly the indices blueward of 4500 @xmath14 , due to the presence of thousands of cn and ch lines ( for a discussion , see schiavon et al .",

    "brown ( 1987 ) , analysing stars at different evolutionary stages , found that the c / n abundance ratio in m67 stars undergoes a sharp drop between @xmath69 and @xmath70 , as a result of the first dredge - up episode .",

    "is @xmath5 0.25 dex lower in m67 giants than in dwarfs .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that the abundance ratios in m67 giants are nonsolar , whereas m67 dwarfs are consistent with a solar carbon abundance , while perhaps being slighty enhanced in nitrogen .    in figure [ ind1 ]",
    ", it can be seen that our model prediction for 3.5 gyr and [ fe / h ] = 0 is in excelent agreement with the measurements of the cn indices in the integrated spectrum of m67 , even though our models have , nominally , solar abundance ratios .",
    "this can be understood in view of the results of gratton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and carretta , gratton & sneden ( 2000 ) , who showed that in field stars the first dredge - up operates a change in the surface composition of carbon and nitrogen which is very similar to what is seen in m67 and other clusters .",
    "therefore , in the field stars that serve as the basis of our models , the run of c , n abundances as a function of evolutionary stage is arguably similar to that of m67 stars , so that the effects due to stellar evolution in m67 stars are accounted for in the models by construction ( this has first been pointed out by gorgas et al .",
    "therefore , no correction due to nonsolar abundance ratios needs to be applied to our model predictions and m67 stars can be considered to constitute a single stellar population with solar [ c , n / fe ] .",
    "the index in figure [ ind2 ] which is most sensitive to the abundance of magnesium is mg @xmath19 , which is the most popular estimator of the metallicities of stellar populations of galaxies , and therefore it is very important that our predictions be consistent with the abundance analyses of m67 stars for magnesium .",
    "there is some disagreement in the literature as to the magnesium abundance of m67 .",
    "foy & proust found @xmath66[mg / fe]@xmath67 = 0 , tautvaisiene et al .",

    "[ ind2 ] , it can be seen that our model prediction for mg @xmath19 is somewhere between [ mg / fe ] = 0.1 and 0.0 , and so it is consistent with abundance analysis work .",
    "however , we stress that more work is needed in order to ascertain the magnesium abundance of m67 .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that our model predictions are consistent to within @xmath0 0.1 dex with the known metal abundances of m67 .",
    "this is reassuring , because it implies that our models predict the correct values of abundance - sensitive indices which are among the most widely used in stellar population work .",
    "we also emphasize that the predictions are consistent for indices which are sensitive to the abundances of a number of important chemical species , like iron and the light elements carbon and nitrogen , and magnesium .",
    "this also means that the models can be used to estimate luminosity - weighted abundance ratios of galaxies in a way that is consistent with the state of the art of our knowledge of stellar abundances in the galaxy .",
    "we would like to start our discussion of the sp properties of m32 by reminding the reader that our spectrum is integrated within a square 3  on a side positioned on the center of the galaxy .",
    "this is important in view of the fact that previous studies have indicated the presence of a radial gradient in the spectroscopic properties of m32 ( davidge 1991 , gonzlez 1993 , hardy et al .",
    "1994 , worthey 2003 ) .    because of its morphology , proximity , and very high central surface brightness",
    ", m32 has become a benchmark for the study of stellar populations , and galaxy evolution in general .",
    "spinrad & taylor ( 1971 ) , and faber ( 1973 ) pioneered the efforts to determine the luminosity - weighted mean metallicity of the central parts of m32 , from low - resolution spectrophotometric observations , but oconnell ( 1980 ) was the first to find that such data for the center of m32 could only be matched by requiring an intermediate age population ( @xmath5 5 gyr ) and near - solar metallicity .",
    "more recent attempts , based on more sophisticated methods and/or modelling , obtained similar results , with age ranging between 3 and 5 gyr and [ fe / h ] within 0.1 dex from the solar value ( e.g. rose 1994 , jones & worthey 1995 , vazdekis & arimoto 1999 , trager et al .",
    "2000 , worthey 2003 , caldwell et al .",
    "these results are confirmed by figure [ specms ] , where we compare the bluer part of the integrated spectrum of m67 that was constructed in section [ comput ] with the observed integrated spectrum of m32 .",
    "some of the most important spectral indices employed in our analysis are indicated in the figure . as can be seen , the two spectra are very similar .",
    "actually , the integrated spectrum of m32 is in general slightly more strong - lined than that of m67 , which suggests a slightly younger age and a slightly higher metallicity .",
    "the latter result can be inspected more quantitatively in figures [ ind1 ] and [ ind2 ] , where lick indices are compared with predictions for single sps . in order to minimize abundance ratio effects , we first focus on the plots of balmer lines against fe indices . according to these plots , the spectroscopic age of m32 is somewhere between 2.0 and 3.5 gyr , whereas its luminosity - weighted iron abundance is super - solar , with + 0.1 @xmath57 [ fe / h ] @xmath57 + 0.3 .",
    "these numbers confirm our expectations based on inspection of the spectra of figure [ specms ] .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the strength of balmer lines is not solely governed by the temperature and brightness of turnoff stars : other families of hot stars , such as blue stragglers and hot horizontal branch ( hb ) stars can affect balmer line strengths , thus hindering their use as age indicators ( e.g. freitas pacheco & barbuy 1995 , lee , yoon & lee 2000 , maraston et al .",
    "2003 ) . in principle",
    ", a small population of hot stars could play a major role in strengthening the balmer lines in m32 , thereby reducing , or eliminating , the necessity for the @xmath52 - 3 gyr old mean population implied by the balmer line strengths .",
    "however , caldwell et al . ( 2003 ) have demonstrated that to explain the enhanced balmer lines in m32 requires a @xmath530% contribution from a hot - star component , whether from a blue hb or blue stragglers . on the other hand",
    ", they also show that the ca ii index , which levers the strength of ca ii k versus h@xmath72 + ca ii h , restricts the contribution from hot stars to a level of @xmath57% .",
    "in addition , m32 has the weakest uv upturn in the sample of burstein et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , so that its relative number of hot hb stars must be low . in principle , cooler bs stars , that do not make such a strong impact on the above - mentioned ca ii index , could be present in m32 , but then they would have to exist in exceedingly large numbers , in fact rivalling the numbers of true msto stars . in short",
    ", we have reasons to be confident that our balmer line measurements primarily provide an estimate of the spectroscopic age of m32 .    with the above caveats in mind",
    ", we now focus on the plots of balmer lines against cn and mg indices , in order to assess the abundance ratios of m32 .",
    "the mg @xmath19 index is mostly sensitive to magnesium . in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure [ ind2 ]",
    "it is seen that m32 has [ fe / h ] @xmath5 + 0.1 according to @xmath64 , while , according to mg @xmath19 it is about 0.1 dex below the solar metallicity model , which is strongly suggestive of [ mg / fe ] @xmath66 0 . in the case of the cn indices ( panels a and b of figure [ ind1 ] ) , in both cases the m32 data fall nearly on top of the [ fe / h]=+0.2 model . since both cn1 and cn2",
    "are mostly sensitive to the combined effect of nitrogen and carbon abundances , and given the above discussion on the iron abundance of m32 , it is likely that m32 has a nearly solar abundance of carbon and/or nitrogen relative to iron .",
    "abundance ratios can be better assessed in plots of metal index against metal index .",
    "such plots are shown in figure [ ind3 ] , where we compare the measurements with the model predictions of single stellar populations for [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and + 0.2 .",
    "the lines connecting models with same age are omitted in these plots for clarity . in panel",
    "( b ) it can be seen that while m67 looks like having strictly solar [ mg / fe ] , m32 deviates by roughly 3 @xmath7 from the model prediction for solar abundance ratios , which confirms the suggestion above that it has [ mg / fe ] @xmath66 0 .",
    "the case for nonsolar abundance ratios for carbon and/or nitrogen is perhaps less convincing , because it depends to some extent on the fe abundance indicator adopted . in panel ( c ) , where cn1 is plotted against fe4383 , m32 is clearly deviating from the solar ratio models , but less so when cn1 is compared with @xmath64 in panel ( d ) ( essentially the same results are obtained in plots involving cn2 ) .",
    "we point out that our results agree with those of worthey ( 2003 ) as regards [ mg / fe ] , but we are in disagreement when it comes to the abundances of carbon and nitrogen , for which he found an enhancement relative to iron of @xmath5 0.2 dex .",
    "finally , we would like to point out an apparent systematic trend of the mean age and metallicity inferred for m32 as a function of wavelength : the resulting age looks lower , and the metallicity looks higher , as we go to bluer indices . according to the @xmath1 vs. @xmath64 plot , the central parts of m32 have luminosity - weighted mean metallicity and age given by [ fe / h ] @xmath5 + 0.1 and @xmath5 3.5 gyr .",
    "according to the @xmath18 vs. fe4383 plot , [ fe / h ] is slightly above + 0.2 , and the mean age is @xmath5 2.5 gyr , while in the @xmath16 vs. fe4383 plot the mean metallicity is even higher and the mean age younger ( @xmath5 2.0 gyr ) . even though the spread in the age determinations is relatively small ( due to the high age sensitivity of balmer lines in this age regime ) , it is significant , given the small errorbars in our measurements . if we assume that the mean age and [ fe / h ] of m32 are as given by the @xmath1 vs. @xmath64 plot ( 3.5 gyr , + 0.1 dex ) , then the measurements of both @xmath18 and @xmath16 are off their predicted positions when plotted against fe4383 by more than 2 @xmath7 .",
    "this result should be contrasted against the case of m67 , for which we found essentially the same age for all balmer lines , and iron abundances according to different fe indices in agreement to within 0.1 dex .",
    "m32 differs from m67 in two basic aspects : 1 ) it is not a single stellar population , but rather a mix of stars of different metallicities ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) and possibly different ages ; 2 ) as discussed above , m32 has an abundance pattern that differs from that of the sun .",
    "a simple calculation shows that a very small fraction of a young ( @xmath5 1.5 gyr ) stellar population on top of an older one can reproduce data for balmer and fe lines .",
    "the younger stellar population is much brighter in the blue , so that it would affect bluer spectral indices more strongly with the result that the bluer balmer lines of such a simple composite stellar population would indicate younger ages .",
    "on the other hand , it might be also possible to reproduce the data by applying the method championed by trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , where the absorption line indices are corrected for varying abundance ratios , based on the computations of synthetic stellar spectra by trippico & bell ( 1995 ) .",
    "the latter does not include calculations for @xmath16 and @xmath18 though , because these indices were defined later , by worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) .",
    "this is important because we have shown , in schiavon et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , that both @xmath18 and @xmath16 are influenced by variations in the abundances of carbon and nitrogen , due to the contamination by cn and ch lines . while we can not correct the higher order balmer lines for the effects of unknown abundance ratios , we recognize that they might be at least partially responsible for the results of figures [ ind1 ] and [ ind2 ] .",
    "it is very hard to disentangle the effect of varying abundance ratios from the potential age mix of stellar populations . as a consequence , when blue indices are involved ,",
    "it is difficult to apply the method devised by trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to assess nonsolar abundance ratios .",
    "the reason is that the method essentially seeks the combination of metal abundances that brings the ages and metallicities into agreement according to the different line indices , so that it tends to wash out any effect due to a mix of stellar populations of different ages . in a future paper",
    ", we will address this problem in more detail .",
    "we have constructed an integrated spectrum of the galactic cluster m67 , from spectroscopic observations of bona fide cluster members .",
    "the resulting integrated spectrum was used as a template for stellar population synthesis , through comparison with model predictions for single stellar populations .",
    "we constrasted the spectroscopic age and metal abundances estimated from the sp models with the age obtained from the cluster cmd , and elemental abundances determined in previous works from high dispersion abundance analyses .",
    "it is the first time that such models are tested to this level of precision in the solar metallicity , intermediate - age regime .",
    "our sp models were then applied to the study of the integrated spectrum of m32 , yielding reliable determinations of the galaxy s light - weighted mean age and metal abundances .",
    "we summarize below our main conclusions .",
    "our models for the known age and metal abundances of m67 match very well its integrated spectrum . adopting the girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) theoretical isochrones for solar metallicity and solar abundance ratios , we matched both the color - magnitude data and integrated spectrum of m67 , for an age of 3.5 gyr and solar metallicity , to within 0.5 gyr and 0.1 dex respectively .",
    "most importantly , we found very good consistency for the ages derived from @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this result demonstrates the remarkable degree of consistency of our models .",
    "we also performed a detailed check to see whether our model predictions are consistent with the known elemental abundances of m67 stars .",
    "we found that the predictions from sp models for the abundances of iron , carbon , nitrogen and magnesium agree with the elemental abundance analyses of individual stars to within 0.1 dex .",
    "the integrated spectrum of m32 is very similar to , though slightly more strong - lined than , that of m67 . on the basis of our newly tested models , we perform an analysis of the integrated spectrum of m32 , with the aim of estimating its light - weighted mean age and metal abundances .",
    "we found that the spectroscopic age of m32 is somewhere between 2 and 3.5 gyr , depending on the balmer line adopted .",
    "for the mean metal abundances , we found [ fe / h ] ranging between + 0.1 and + 0.4 , again depending on the metallicity indicators adopted . for light elements , we found m32 to be underabundant in magnesium relative to iron , with [ mg / fe ] @xmath5 0.2 , whereas the combined abundances of carbon and nitrogen seem to be nearly solar relative to iron . a more in - depth study of the composite nature of the stellar populations in m32 is deferred to a forthcoming paper .",
    "contrary to the case of m67 , application of our single stellar population models to the integrated spectrum of the central parts of m32 revealed a systematic effect in the resulting ages and metallicities as a function of wavelength .",
    "use of red indices results in a mean age @xmath5 1.5 times older and a metallicity @xmath5 0.3 dex lower than when blue indices are adopted .",
    "this result can be due to either the effects of nonsolar abundance ratios on blue absorption indices , and/or to a mix of stellar populations in m32 , with different ages .",
    "\\4 . in agreement with previous studies",
    ", we found that blue stragglers contribute with an unusually high fraction of the blue integrated light of m67 .",
    "this result is robust , since our integrated spectrum is constructed on the basis of photometry which is complete down to many magnitudes below the turnoff .",
    "we suggest that this result might be due to the cluster s past history of severe mass segregation , followed by evaporation of low - mass stars .",
    "calibrating models by comparison with integrated spectra of clusters has become a standard procedure in the field of stellar population synthesis .",
    "the nature of the galactic globular cluster system , and the limitations of our knowledge of the detailed abundance pattern of their constituent stars , has prevented an accurate calibration of such models with the degree of accuracy that is required for many of their applications .",
    "the latter is particularly true in the regime of solar metallicity and intermediate ages , which is of great importance in view of its potential application for the study of stellar populations of distant systems , for which the lookback times are more than half the hubble time .",
    "this work is an attempt at filling this gap .",
    "applications of our models to the study of galaxies both nearby and at cosmological distances are currently under way .",

    "<S> we construct an integrated spectrum of the intermediate age , solar metallicity galactic cluster m67 , from individual spectroscopic observations of bona fide cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum so obtained is used as a template to test our stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models , in an age and metallicity regime where such models remain largely untested . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that our models predict a spectroscopic age of 3.5 @xmath0 0.5 gyr for m67 , which is the same age we obtain from fitting isochrones to the color - magnitude diagram of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> full consistency is reached when using either @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 as the age indicator . </S>",
    "<S> we also check if the models , when applied to the cluster integrated spectrum , predict elemental abundances in agreement with the known detailed abundance pattern of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the models also pass the latter test , by predicting the abundances of iron , magnesium , carbon and nitrogen in agreement with detailed abundance analyses of cluster stars to within 0.1 dex . encouraged by the high degree of consistency of our models , </S>",
    "<S> we apply them to the study of the integrated spectrum of the central 3  of the compact elliptical galaxy m32 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting luminosity - weighted age of the galaxy ranges between 2 and 3.5 gyr , depending on the age indicator adopted . </S>",
    "<S> according to our models , the center of m32 seems to have a super - solar iron abundance , ranging between [ fe / h ] @xmath4 and + 0.3 , depending on the spectral index adopted . </S>",
    "<S> the light element magnesium seems to be underabundant in the center of m32 relative to iron by about @xmath5 0.10.2 dex , whereas the data are consistent with nearly solar carbon and nitrogen abundances relative to iron . </S>",
    "<S> we find that single age , single metallicity stellar population models with a solar - scaled abundance pattern can not fit all the balmer and metal lines in the integrated spectrum of m32 . in particular , there is a systematic trend in the sense that bluer absorption lines indicate a younger age and a higher metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> this slight inconsistency can be due either to ( unaccounted for ) abundance ratio effects on blue iron and balmer line indices , or to a spread of the ages of the stellar populations in m32 . </S>",
    "<S> current stellar population models can not break this degeneracy at the level of accuracy required to address this problem . </S>"
