    "bl lacertae objects , also known as markarian objects ( hereafter mkns ) , belong to the class of active galaxies . according to the well - established unified model on radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( see urry and padovani @xcite ) , these objects are thought to be dominated by relativistic jets seen at small angles to the line of sight .",
    "the structure of the relativistic jets is largely unknown and the typical smooth and fairly featureless spectra of such objects may be reproduced by models making use of very different assumptions .",
    "combining spectral and temporal informations greatly constrains the available models .    up to now",
    ", several astrophysical phenomena have been attributed to binary black holes , like precession of jets ( begelman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , misalignment ( conway and wrobel @xcite ) , periodic outburst activity in the quasar oj @xmath0 ( sillinp@xmath1 et al .",
    "@xcite , letho and valtonen @xcite ) and precession of the accretion disk under gravitational torque ( katz @xcite ) .",
    "it has been recently observed that some mkn objects show a periodic behaviour in the radio , optical , x - ray and @xmath2-ray light curves that is possibly related to the presence of a massive binary black hole creating a jet either aligned along the line of sight or interacting with an accretion disk ( yu @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the search for x - ray/@xmath2-ray variability can be considered as a method to probe the existence of a massive binary black hole in the center of a galaxy .",
    "massive black hole systems are expected to be fairly common in the universe as a result of merging between galaxies . indeed , in the framework of the unified model for the morphological evolution of galaxies ( see _ e.g. _ white @xcite )",
    "giant ellipticals , which are the host galaxies of most mkn objects , appear to be the result of mergers between spirals . on the other hand , it is now well established that galaxies generally contain massive black holes in their nuclei ( rees @xcite , kormendy and richstone @xcite , richstone et al .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "merging would naturally lead to the formation of massive binary black holes ( begelman et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "at least three mkn objects ( _ i.e _ mkn 501 , mkn 421 and mkn 766 ) are particularly well studied at high energies , revealing a possible periodic behaviour in their light curves .",
    "mkn 501 , at @xmath3 , shows a clear well - correlated 23 day periodicity in @xmath4-ray and tev energy bands with an observed tev flux ratio @xmath5 8 between the maximum and minimum of the signal ( protheroe et al .",
    "@xcite , hayashida et al .",
    "@xcite , kranich et al .",
    "@xcite , nishikawa et al .",
    "@xcite ) , while evidence for correlations in the optical u - band is rather weak ( catanese et al .",
    "@xcite , aharonian et al .",
    "it has also been suggested that the complex morphology of the jet and the peculiar behaviour of its spectral energy distribution are probably related to the presence of a massive binary black hole ( conway and wrobel @xcite , villata and raiteri @xcite ) .",
    "mkn 421 , at @xmath6 , is the brightest bl lacertae object at @xmath4-ray and uv wavelengths and it is the first extragalactic source discovered at tev energies ( punch et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this nearby source , which has been recently observed by the xmm - newton ( see brinkmann et al .",
    "@xcite ) and by bepposax ( maraschi et al .",
    "@xcite ) satellites , shows remarkable @xmath4-ray variability correlated with strong activity at tev energies ( george et al .",
    "@xcite ) on a time - scale of @xmath7 s ( maraschi et al .",
    "@xcite ) and with a flux ratio @xmath8 .",
    "x - ray observations of the nearby mkn 766 , at @xmath9 , have been performed by the xmm - newton satellite ( boller , keill , tr@xmath10mper et al .",
    "these observations have revealed the presence of a strong @xmath4-ray periodic signal with frequency @xmath11 hz and flux ratio @xmath12 .    based on the assumption that the periodic observed light curve of mkn 501 is related to the presence of a binary system of black holes ( one of which emits a jet ) ,",
    "rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) have proposed a method to determine the physical parameters of the binary system from the observed quantities , i. e. signal periodicity , flux ratio between maximum and minimum signal and power law spectral index .",
    "they adopted the simplifying assumptions that _",
    "i ) _ the two massive black holes move on circular orbits around the common center of mass and _ ii ) _ the binary separation @xmath13 is such that the gas dynamical time - scale @xmath14 is equal to the time - scale for gravitational radiation @xmath15 ( see also begelman , blandford and rees @xcite ) .",
    "however , if binary black holes originated from galactic mergers , they could be on eccentric orbits and eccentricity values up to @xmath16-@xmath17 are not necessarily too extreme ( fitchett @xcite ) .",
    "of course , due to gravitational wave emission , orbits tend to circularize but this happens within a time - scale of the same order of magnitude as the merging time - scale ( peters @xcite , fitchett @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , if a massive binary black hole is found at the center of a galaxy , it may happen that the constituting black holes are still on eccentric orbits , in which case the method proposed by rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) does not hold .",
    "as far as point _",
    "ii ) _ is concerned , we note that the assumption that nowadays @xmath14 is equal to @xmath15 is arbitrary .",
    "indeed , it is possible that @xmath18 at some time in the past , but since then the binary system evolution was driven by gravitational wave emission which shrunk the orbital separation faster ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to generalize the model proposed by rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) by taking into account the effects of the orbital eccentricity of the binary system and considering the binary separation @xmath13 as a free model parameter .",
    "this is done in section 2 , where the model is also applied to three well - observed mkn objects ( mkn 501 , mkn 421 and mkn 766 ) obtaining a set of possible values for the free model parameters @xmath19 , @xmath13 and @xmath20 corresponding to different values for the masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the two black holes . in section",
    "@xmath23 we study the gravitational waves emitted by the binary systems at the center of the above - quoted mkn objects and analyze the possibility of detecting them by the lisa gravitational wave interferometer .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "in the commonly - accepted evolutionary scenario , giant elliptical galaxies are believed to be the product of mergers between spiral galaxies .",
    "since each galaxy likely contains a central black hole with mass 10@xmath24 - 10@xmath25 @xmath26 ( richstone , ajhar and bender @xcite ) , merging would sometimes produce binary black hole systems separated by a typical distance of @xmath27 pc ( begelman , blandford and rees @xcite ) ) .",
    "we assume that binary black holes exist in the center of many mkn objects and in particular in those of mkn 501 , mkn 421 and mkn 766 . as in rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the periodicity in the flaring state , observed towards these objects , is assumed to be the consequence of the orbital motion of a relativistic jet in the binary black hole .",
    "therefore , the observed signal periodicity has a geometrical origin , being a consequence of doppler - shifted modulation .",
    "let us further assume that the jet is emitted by the less massive black hole and that the nonthermal @xmath28/@xmath2-ray radiation propagates outwards from the core along the jet with lorentz gamma factor @xmath29 .",
    "the observed flux modulation due to doppler boosting can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the source spectral index for the three mkns of interest are found to be 1.2 , 1.7 and 2.11 for mkn 501 , mkn 421 and mkn 766 , respectively . for more details",
    "see rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) , guainazzi , vacanti , maizia et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and boller , keill , tr@xmath10mper et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . ] and the doppler factor is given by @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the outflow velocity in the direction of the total angular momentum , @xmath34 is the inclination angle between the jet axis and the line of sight and @xmath35 is the component of the less massive black hole velocity along the line of sight .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath21 represent the masses of the primary and the secondary black hole , respectively .",
    "conventionally , the problem of predicting the motion of a system of two gravitationally interacting point masses is simplified by considering the equivalent system .",
    "this consists of a mass @xmath36 fixed in space and acting on a reduced mass @xmath37 that orbits around it .",
    "we assume that the reduced mass moves around the total mass on an elliptic orbit with semi - major axis @xmath13 and eccentricity @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath38 be the polar coordinates of @xmath39 relative to @xmath40 , so that the equation of the orbit is given by @xmath41 it is straightforward to demonstrate that the component of the reduced mass velocity along the line of sight is given by ( smart @xcite ) @xmath42 the component of the less massive black hole velocity along the line of sight is thus given by @xmath43 which can be rewritten as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46^{1/2}$ ] is the keplerian orbital frequency if the mass @xmath21 moves on a circular orbit of radius @xmath13 around @xmath22 .",
    "the velocity @xmath35 is maximal for @xmath47 and minimal for @xmath48 , corresponding through equation ( [ doppler ] ) to the two possible values @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the doppler factor .    with the assumption that the periodicity in the observed signal is due to the orbital motion of the binary black hole , from equation ( [ flux ] ) one obtains the condition @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the observed maximum to minimum flux ratio",
    "consequently , by using equations ( [ doppler ] ) and ( [ vlessmassivebh ] ) we have @xmath53 which , in the limit @xmath54 , reduces to equation ( @xmath55 ) in rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , from equation ( [ observedperiodicity ] ) one has @xmath64 ^ 2 \\frac{a^3}{g}~ , \\label{massratio2}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 represents the semi - major axis of the binary system .",
    "therefore , the allowed primary and secondary black hole masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 are obtained by solving simultaneously equations ( [ massratio1 ] ) and ( [ massratio2 ] ) . in these equations",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath13 have to be considered as free model parameters to be determined by the observed data ( @xmath56 , @xmath52 and @xmath31 ) towards the three mkk of interest . in this way , we can estimate the masses of the black holes supposed to be at the centers of mkn 501 , mkn 421 and mkn 766 .",
    "we mention that equation ( [ massratio2 ] ) is different from the corresponding one in rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) , where the binary separation @xmath13 is obtained by equating the gas dynamical time - scale ( begelman , blandford and rees @xcite ) with the time - scale for gravitational radiation ( peters and mathews @xcite ) . here ,",
    "as previously stated , we release this assumption and consider @xmath13 as a free fit parameter .",
    "for the three mkn objects considered , the secondary mass @xmath21 as a function of the primary one @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "[ mcontromtotale ] for selected values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for each binary system",
    ", the intersection between lines with the same lorentz factor determines the masses of the two black hole components .    in fig .",
    "[ mcontrogamma ] ( for mkn 501 ) we show the primary and secondary black hole masses as a function of the orbit eccentricity for two values of the lorentz factor @xmath67 and @xmath68 cm . in this case ,",
    "the black hole masses are in the range @xmath69 .",
    "psfile = mvsmtot.eps vscale=55 .",
    "in this section , the massive black hole binaries in the mkn objects considered in section 2 are examined as possible sources of gravitational radiation . due to the orbital period of the binary systems considered",
    ", it is expected that they emit most of the gravitational radiation in the low - frequency band ( @xmath70 hz ) .",
    "gravitational waves in this band are only accessible to experiments based on the doppler tracking technique of inter - planetary spacecrafts .",
    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) , consisting of a constellation of three drag - free spacecrafts at the vertices of an ideal equilater triangle with sides of @xmath71 km ( hiscock , larson , routzahn and kulick @xcite ) , has an optimal sensitivity in the frequency range covering the band @xmath72 hz - @xmath73 hz ( vecchio @xcite ) .",
    "lisa will be able to carry out a deep and extensive census of black hole populations in the universe , providing an accurate demography of these objects and their interactions .",
    "in particular we expect that binaries of massive black holes could be detectable by lisa even if the emitted gravitational waves are characterized by extremely low frequencies ( @xmath74 hz )",
    ". this could be the case for the binaries at the center of the three mkn objects considered under particular conditions ( e.g. for the same values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "equations ( [ gwpower])-([signalamplitude ] ) allow us to evaluate the expected spectrum of the gravitational waves emitted by the massive black hole binaries assumed to be in the center of the considered mkn objects . assuming @xmath90 , fig .",
    "[ hvsftot ] shows the expected gravitational wave amplitude @xmath91 as a function of the frequency @xmath92 , for different values of the binary orbit eccentricity . in each panel of the figure we give for comparison the lisa sensitivity curve ( the oblique solid line ) for an integration time of @xmath93 years .",
    "as can be noted , in several cases the expected gravitational waves emitted by the considered binary systems may be detected by lisa satellite .",
    "eccentricity values up to @xmath16 are not necessarily too extreme .",
    "in fact , if a black hole binary forms in a merging process , a very high value of eccentricity is expected .",
    "of course , due to the gravitational wave emission the orbit tends to circularize but this should happen within a time - scale of the same order of the magnitude of the merging time - scale ( peters @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ modelli2 ] , the binary semimajor axis @xmath13 is shown as a function of the orbital eccentricity @xmath20 and for two different lorentz factors @xmath76 for mkn 501 , mkn 421 and mkn 766 , respectively .",
    "each point in the 3d scatter plot fits the observations and satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ massratio1 ] ) and ( [ massratio2 ] ) .",
    "each point on the plot corresponds to a different distance @xmath94 ( vertical axis ) between the gravitational wave emitted spectrum and the lisa sensitivity curve for an integration time of 5 years ( the minimum distance between the curves diminishes as @xmath95 increases ) . in fig .",
    "[ modelli2 ] , only models with @xmath96 are shown .",
    "models corresponding to @xmath97 in the plot have to be considered as observable by the lisa satellite . we notice that models corresponding to higher values of the parameter @xmath95 have typically higher masses and lower coalescing times with respect to those with lower @xmath95 values . in any case , black hole masses are below @xmath98 .",
    "we have considered some astrophysical implications of the existence of massive black hole binary systems at the center of mkn objects .",
    "these systems are expected to be fairly common in the universe as a consequence of merging processes between galaxies .",
    "in fact , following the evolutionary scenario , giant elliptical galaxies are thought to be the result of merging between spirals .",
    "since almost each galaxy contains a massive black hole in its center , merging process would naturally lead to the formation of massive black hole binaries .",
    "currently , the only method to probe the existence of massive binary black holes is to search for double nuclei in the galactic centers .",
    "however , as pointed out by rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) and yu ( @xcite ) , a periodic behaviour in the observed radio , optical , @xmath4-ray or @xmath2-ray light curves could be considered as the signature of a massive binary black hole .    in this paper",
    ", we focused on the possibility of explaining the intensity variations observed in some mkn objects as the consequence of the motion of binary black holes around the common center of mass .",
    "we have generalized the treatment of rieger and mannheim ( @xcite ) considering in detail the effects of the orbital eccentricity .",
    "at least three mkn objects ( mkn 501 , mkn 421 and mkn 766 ) reveal a possible periodic behaviour in the observed signal .",
    "in particular , it has been recently addressed whether mkn 501 hosts a massive black hole binary system ( rieger and mannheim @xcite ) .",
    "the same likely holds for mkn 421 and mkn 766 . the model described in section 2 allows us to estimate the mass of each black hole in the binary system ( see fig .",
    "[ mcontromtotale ] ) as a function of the lorentz factor @xmath19 , of the orbital radius @xmath13 and eccentricity @xmath20 .",
    "if massive binary black holes really exist in the centers of the mkn objects considered above , they should also emit low frequency gravitational waves typically with @xmath99 hz . in fig .",
    "[ hvsftot ] we have presented the gravitational wave spectrum emitted by binaries that fit all the observational data ( flux ratio @xmath52 , the signal periodicity @xmath56 and the source spectral index @xmath31 ) . as one can note , for some values of @xmath13 and @xmath20 one can obtain curves above the sensitivity threshold of the lisa detector ( we assume an integration time of @xmath93 years ) .",
    "it is obvious that binary systems emitting gravitational waves detectable by the lisa satellite have short coalescing times .",
    "for example , in the case of mkn 501 the average coalescing time for the models represented in fig .",
    "[ modelli2 ] ( for @xmath100 ) is @xmath101 years and tends to decrease for higher values of the parameter @xmath95 .",
    "however , for signal detection , some caution is needed since the lisa sensitivity curve we use in figs .",
    "[ hvsftot ] and [ modelli2 ] does not take into account the noise from the galactic binaries containing two compact objects .",
    "especially important are galactic white dwarf binaries ( hils and bender @xcite , nelemans , yungelson and portegies - zwart @xcite , nelemans , portegies - zwart and verbunt @xcite ) , primordial black holes ( hiscock @xcite ) and white dwarf binaries ( hiscock , larson , routzahn and kulick @xcite ) in the galactic halo",
    ". these binaries would give rise to a confusion noise which lies well above lisa s sensitivity curve in the frequency range of interest between @xmath102 hz and @xmath103 hz ( see e.g. fig . 3 in nelemans , yungelson and portegies - zwart @xcite ) .",
    "this noise would make even more difficult the detection of the considered massive black hole binary systems so that , in order to have detectable signals , one would need more extreme conditions ( e.g. higher values of the parameter @xmath95 or , equivalently , shorter coalescing times ) .    as a final remark",
    "we notice that it is possible that there are a lot of hard binary black holes at the center of galaxies , mkn objects , seyfert galaxies , etc . , and that we can observe directly ( from the periodicity of lightcurves at high energy ) only a small fraction of them .",
    "if this is so , detection of gravitational waves from such systems would be a means to detect them .",
    "it is worth noting that the number of intervening galaxies between earth and a galaxy at redshift @xmath104 is @xmath105~,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the typical galaxy radius and @xmath107 the average number density of galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is expected that at least in some cases gravitational lenses , displaced along the line of sight of a gravitational wave source , should distort the path of the gravitational waves just as they distort the path of the observed light . for gravitational waves with frequency @xmath108 hz",
    ", the lisa angular resolution is below @xmath109 steradians ( cutler @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the lensed source is always seen as an amplitude amplification ( i.e. as a microlensing event ) and the observed amplitude , at the frequency @xmath87 , is ( de paolis , ingrosso and nucita @xcite ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the amplification parameter depending on the geometry of the microlensing configuration .",
    "this amplification could be in some cases of the order of @xmath112 or more , thereby increasing the number of detectable binary black holes at galactic centers by future gravitational wave detectors like lisa .",
    "even more interesting would be the effect of the gravitational wave time - delay due to the different paths traveled by the deflected signals .",
    "this time - delay , of about one year as for the lensed quasars , would give rise to a frequency difference due to the binary evolution with time .",
    "this effect could produce a `` beating pattern '' in the wave amplitude which could be searched for in future gravitational wave experiments .",
