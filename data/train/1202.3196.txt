    "observatory , the spectroscopic temperature of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in many cd clusters of galaxies decreases toward the center by a factor of @xmath4 ( e.g. , canizares et al . 1988 ; mushotzky & szymkowiak 1988 ; see also fabian 1994 for a review ) .",
    "generally , the appearance of such a central cool component ( hereafter ccc ) has been described in two possible but competing ways .",
    "one is a single - phase ( hereafter 1p ) scenario , in which a mono - nature plasma showing an inward temperature decrease is assumed to permeate the whole cluster ( e.g. , allen et al .",
    "2001 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "the other is a two - phase ( hereafter 2p ) scenario , in which the cluster s central region is assumed to be occupied by a mixture of two gas components characterized by discrete temperatures ( i.e. , hot and cool ) , of which the relative volume filling factors slowly vary with radius ( e.g. , fukazawa et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ; takahashi et al . 2009",
    "; see makishima et al .",
    "2001 for a review ) .",
    "although in many cases it is difficult to distinguish between the 1p and 2p models due to insufficient data quality , the implications of these models on the formation and evolution of the ccc are intrinsically different . in the 1p scenario the ccc",
    "is simply interpreted as the dense cluster core , where radiative losses have significantly lowered the gas temperature ( see , e.g. , peterson & fabian 2006 for a review ) , while the 2p scenario favors an interpretation that the ccc is caused by the cd galaxy , rather than being a cooling portion of the icm ( makishima et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the choice between the two scenarios has considerable impact on the accuracies of the measurements of both gas metallicities ( e.g. , the `` fe - bias '' discussed in buote 2000 ) and , in some extreme cases , gravitating mass distributions in clusters .",
    "for the latter one , the systematic mass bias induced by different icm models can reach @xmath5% for the cluster s central region , which is comparable to the typical deviation between the results obtained in x - ray and lensing studies ( e.g. , nagai et al .",
    "2007 ; mahdavi et al . 2008 ) .",
    "hence , it is of fundamental and urgent importance to determine which of the two scenarios is valid , based on the analysis of existing high quality x - ray data of nearby , bright clusters .",
    "so far , only a few works have been done to examine the preference between the 1p and 2p icm models of cd groups and clusters . of these ,",
    "fukazawa et al . ( 1994 ) and ikebe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used the _ asca _ data to show that a 2p model with temperatures of 1.4 kev and 4.4 kev for the two components is required to describe the ccc of the centaurus cluster .",
    "their results were recently confirmed by the analysis of the high quality data acquired with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) and reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) onboard  ( takahashi et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the preference for the 2p scenario was also reported in the works on the fornax cluster ( ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ; matsushita et al . 2007 ) and the ngc 5044 group ( buote & fabian 1998 ; buote et al . 2003 ; tamura et al .",
    "2003 ) with _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "however , due to the lack of such studies on more representative relaxed clusters or groups that exhibit strong cccs , it is not yet clear whether or not the 2p scenario do surpass the 1p scenario in general , and if yes , to what extent the 2p model can be applied to constrain the origin of the ccc .    to address these issues , we study in this work the rich , bright cd cluster of galaxies abell 1795 ( a1795 hereafter ) , by jointly analyzing the archival _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and  data .",
    "a1795 is suited to our purpose as it is a relaxed , nearby ( at a redshift of z @xmath6 ) cluster of galaxies with a luminous x - ray emission ( with a @xmath7 kev luminosity of @xmath8 ergs @xmath9 ; xu et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is found peaked at the giant cd galaxy pgc 049005 ( jones & forman 1984 ; briel & henry 1996 ) . under the 2p assumption , xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) resolved a cool ( @xmath10 kev ) and a hot ( @xmath11 kev ) component in the central 220@xmath12 kpc region of this cluster with _",
    "asca _ , although ettori et al .",
    "( 2002 ) employed the 1p model instead to fit _",

    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ suzaku _ , respectively .",
    "clearly this is an ideal target for utilizing as much of existing high - quality x - ray data as possible to judge which spectral model is more correct .",

    "five acis - s3 exposures focused on the cluster center , and six acis - i exposures covered off - center regions up to @xmath20 mpc . all data were telemetered in vfaint mode , except for the one with obsid 494 in faint mode . using ciao v4.4 and caldb v4.4.7",

    "to enhance the precision of the monte - carlo simulation carried out by xissimarfgen , we created the initial feed photon list by combining all the exposure - corrected and background - subtracted acis - i images .",
    "the method to build the response of hxd - pin is described in  3.4 .",
    "we estimated the background as a combination of three independent components , i.e. , non x - ray background ( nxb ) , cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , and galactic emission .",
    "for all the xis data , we created the nxb spectra using a dark earth observation database .",
    "the cxb and galactic emission components in the xis data were estimated by analyzing a spectrum extracted from a region about @xmath40  ( @xmath41@xmath12 mpc at the distance of a1795 ) south of the cluster center , which is covered by the dataset with obsid = 800012050 ( table 1 ) ; a similar background region was used in bautz et al .",

    "2009 ) , the icm component can be ignored in the background fitting . after subtracting the nxb from the extracted spectrum , we fitted the resulting spectrum with an absorbed power law model ( photon index @xmath50 ) describing the cxb , and two unabsorbed optically thin thermal models ( abundance = 1 @xmath51 , temperatures = 0.08 kev and 0.2 kev ; snowden et al .",
    "1998 ) describing the galactic emission .",
    "the @xmath7 kev cxb flux was estimated as @xmath52 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath9 @xmath53 , which is consistent with the results of kushino et al .",
    "the obtained cxb + galactic background template was applied to all the subsequent xis spectral analysis assuming the same uniform cxb + galactic emission distribution over the field of view ( e.g. , sato et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in order to achieve an accordant background model for the _ chandra _ acis",

    "we subtracted the cxb + galactic components from the extracted spectra , whose brightness was fixed at the xis result obtained above , and fitted the resulting spectra with an empirical nxb model that consists of a broken power law and five narrow gaussian lines ( e.g. , humphrey & buote 2006 ) , plus a thermal apec model for the cluster emission . since the temperature and metal abundance of this icm component can not be well constrained , due to the relatively high nxb level of the acis , we fixed them to previous _",

    "the acis - i nxb model was thus determined .",
    "the same procedure was applied to all acis - s data , but source free regions on the s1 chip were used as the background regions instead . to crosscheck above background model with the blank sky templates , we applied both backgrounds to the spectral analysis in  3.1.1 . by fitting the background - subtracted acis spectra extracted from @xmath59 with a single - phase thermal model",
    ", we found that the icm temperatures with the two background models differ by 0.35 kev , which is less than the 1@xmath30 uncertainties of 0.5 kev .",
    "the error caused by background model is much smaller for the inner regions , where the icm emission contributes to @xmath60% of the total counts in @xmath61 kev ( table 2 ) .    the background model for the _ xmm - newton _ epic data",
    "was determined with a method similar to that used for the _ chandra _ acis data .",
    "the epic spectra extracted from @xmath62  ( @xmath63@xmath12 mpc ) away from the cluster center , covered by the data with obsid = 0109070201 , were fit with a model consisting of the cxb + galactic components , the epic nxb model including a broken power law and six gaussian lines ( e.g. , gastaldello et al .",

    "_ , we plot the nxb - subtracted background spectra against the best - fit cxb and galactic components for the acis , epic , and xis , as well as the cluster emission component for the former two instruments . for the rgs data , we employed the blank sky template ( e.g. , takahashi et al .",
    "2009 ) in the following spectral analysis .",
    "errors quoted below in the spectral fittings were estimated by taking into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the former was calculated by scanning over the parameter space with the xspec command _ steppar _ , as the fitting was repeated for a few iterations at each step to ensure that the actual minimum @xmath66 is found . for the latter , we altered the normalization of the cxb spectra by 10% ( kushino et al .",
    "2002 ) to approximate its field - to - field variation , and similarly , re - normalized the nxb components by 2% , 2% , and 1% for the acis , epic , and xis data ( e.g. , hickox & markevitch 2006 ; de luca & molendi 2004 ; tawa et al .",
    "2008 ) , respectively , to assess the error ranges .",
    "we have also tried assigning a systematic error of 2% to approximate the unassessed calibration uncertainties of the epic data ( e.g. , takahashi et al . 2009 ) , which turned out to have negligible impacts on the results and thus was not included in the actual fittings .",
    "we extracted the acis and epic spectra from eight thin annuli , i.e. , @xmath67@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath69@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath71@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath75@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath77@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath78 ) , @xmath79@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath81@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath82 ) , and the xis spectra from four thick annuli , i.e. , @xmath83@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath84 ) , @xmath85@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath87@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath89@xmath12 kpc ( @xmath90 ) . when fitting these spectra , the lower energy cut was set at 0.7 kev , 0.7 kev , and 0.6 kev for the acis , epic , and xis , respectively , while the upper cut was fixed at 8.0 kev for all the three detectors .",
    "also , the si k edge ( @xmath91 kev ) was excluded from all the xis spectra .",
    "independent fittings were carried out for the _ chandra _ ( acis - s and acis - i ) , _ xmm - newton _ ( mos and pn ) , and  ( bi and fi ) spectrum sets , by applying a common absorbed apec model and linking all annuli with xspec model projct , which performs projection of 3-d shells onto 2-d annuli to evaluate the projected emission of outer shells on inner ones . for each shell , the gas temperature , metal abundance , and column density of the neutral absorber were set free .",
    "the best - fit model yielded @xmath92 , 1040/881 , and 845/775 for the acis , epic , and xis spectra , respectively .",
    "figure 2_b _ and 2_c _ show the best - fit deprojected 1p fittings to the spectra extracted from @xmath87@xmath12 kpc and core regions ( @xmath93@xmath12 kpc for the acis and epic , and @xmath83@xmath12 kpc for the xis ) , respectively .    as shown in figure 3_a _ , the best - fit deprojected 1p temperature drops inwards from @xmath94 kev at @xmath95@xmath12 kpc to @xmath96 kev in the central 30@xmath12 kpc , which shows apparent diagnostic of a cool core ( e.g. , sanderson et al .",
    "on the other hand , in the cluster s outskirt ( @xmath97@xmath12 kpc ) , the temperature declines outwards steeply down to @xmath96 kev .",
    "generally , our 1p temperature profiles are consistent with previous reports ( e.g. , ettori et al .",
    "2002 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2006 ; snowden et al . 2008 ; bautz et al .",
    "incidentally , in @xmath98@xmath12 kpc , the temperature obtained with the acis spectra is by about @xmath99 kev higher than those measured with the epic and xis spectra .",
    "this discrepancy can be ascribed to a local temperature structure ( see  3.2.2 ) , which is smoothed to some extent in the and  data .",
    "although the best - fit 1p model can reproduce the three data groups with reasonable goodness , i.e. , @xmath100 , the fitting residuals become drastically significant in the central 80@xmath12 kpc regions , where the averaged gas temperature is measured to be @xmath101 kev ( fig .",
    "3_a _ ) . as shown in figure 2_c",
    "_ , the 1p model significantly underestimates the fe - l blend and the continuum in @xmath23 5.0 kev .",
    "this indicates that these annular spectra exhibit stronger multi - temperature nature than is predicted by foreground and background contributions from different radii that are accounted for by the projct model . to further examine the issues with the 1p icm model for these regions , following , e.g. , cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we fitted the acis spectra in @xmath102 kev and @xmath103 kev with the 1p model , both extracted from the central 80@xmath12 kpc and corrected for projection effects .",
    "the 1p gas temperature obtained in @xmath102 kev ( @xmath104 kev ) became lower than its counterpart in @xmath103 kev ( @xmath105 kev ) at the 99% confidence level .",
    "the bandpass dependence can not be ascribed to the calibration problem of _ chandra _ at soft band , because a similar dependence can be obtained using the _ xmm - newton _ data , with @xmath106 kev and @xmath107 kev .",
    "thus , the 1p modeling of the icm is considered inadequate , and a 2p icm spectral model is hence invoked .",
    "next we investigate whether or not the 2p icm model , as inferred in the above 1p analysis , is applicable to the spectra extracted in the inner 80@xmath12 kpc region , after the projection effects are taken into account . here , the 2p icm components were both represented by thermal apec models , which were constrained to have the same metallicity and absorption .",
    "both the cool- and hot - phase icm temperatures ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively ) were tied among all the thin shells in central 80@xmath12 kpc , while the 1p icm model (  3.1.1 ) was retained for the outer parts .",
    "this fitting yielded overall @xmath110 = 1608/1494 and 929/879 for the acis and epic spectrum sets , respectively .",
    "the fitting goodness was compared to the 1p one (  3.1.1 ) using an f - test , which yielded @xmath111-statistic of 66.0 and 52.5 for the acis and epic data , respectively , indicating that the 2p model gives a better fit than the 1p model at @xmath23 99% confidence level . as shown in figure 2 _ c _ , the 2p icm model apparently better reproduces the fe - l blend and the continuum in @xmath23 5.0 kev than its 1p counterpart .",
    "this shows that the 2p icm model is strongly and consistently required for the inner 80@xmath12 kpc region even after removing ( via projct ) foreground and background contributions from the outer shells .",
    "the 2p temperatures ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) were determined as ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) kev and ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) kev by using the acis and epic data , respectively . for the regions with @xmath116@xmath12 kpc , the 2p model does not significantly improve the fitting over the 1p model .",
    "the same 2p icm model was also applied to the thick shell spectra obtained with the xis .",
    "compared to the 1p case (  3.1.1 ; @xmath117 ) , the 2p icm model again gave significantly better fit to the xis spectra within central @xmath118@xmath12 kpc region , with reduced chi - squared improved to @xmath110 = 802/773 . since the psf of the xis is much wider than those of the acis and epic , with the xis alone we can not constrain the boundary between the 1p and 2p regions to a small radius , as we did with the acis and epic data . to examine the psf effect on the spectral fitting of the innermost thick shell ( @xmath83@xmath12 kpc )",
    ", we performed a ray tracing simulation ( e.g. , ishisaki et al .",
    "2007 ; reiprich et al . 2009 ) based on the acis image , and found that the @xmath39 kev counts in this shell are mostly ( @xmath119% ) from the emission originated in @xmath93@xmath12 kpc , only a small fraction ( @xmath120% ) come from @xmath75@xmath12 kpc region where a hotter component ( @xmath121 kev ; figure 3_a _ ) is detected with the acis data .",
    "hence this hot component can not bias the 2p result significantly .",
    "in fact , the best - fit 2p temperatures for this region , @xmath122 kev and @xmath123 kev , are consistent with those obtained in the thin shell analysis .",
    "thus , the psf of the xis little affects the 2p results obtained for the innermost thick shell .    as the most consistent form of our 2p analysis",
    ", we simultaneously fitted the thin shell spectra ( the acis and epic ) and those from the thick shell ( the xis ) , by allowing to vary independently the pair of 2p temperatures of each inner shell , i.e. , @xmath124@xmath12 kpc and @xmath125@xmath12 kpc for the acis / epic and xis cases , respectively .",
    "nearly the same fit goodness was achieved ( table 2 ) , and the best - fit @xmath108 and @xmath109 , as shown in figure 4_a _ and table 2 , exhibit nearly insignificant spatial variations across the inner shells .",
    "the values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are consistent among the three instruments , and broadly consistent with the  result , ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) = ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) kev , reported in xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in short ,",
    "the icm in the cool core of this cluster can be described by two discrete temperatures , @xmath128 kev and @xmath129 kev , which are both consistent with being spatially constant .",
    "this makes the simple 2p icm picture ( makishima et al .",
    "2001 ) a natural and reasonable description .      employing the 1p formalism , fabian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported a filamentary structure in the inner 50@xmath12 kpc region of a1795 , with a possible temperature of @xmath130 kev , apparently lower than the value of @xmath108 obtained in our 2p analysis .",
    "to look for such a component , we added a third apec component to the 2p icm model describing the xis data from the central 144@xmath12 kpc region .",
    "indeed , we obtained a significantly better fit ( @xmath131 ) by adding a third apec component , whose temperature is @xmath132@xmath133 kev , while its metal abundance , absorption , and redshift were tied to those of the 2p icm components .",

    "the cool phase gas occupies up to @xmath160 of the volume in the central @xmath161@xmath12 kpc , whereas @xmath150 declines steeply to below 0.05 outside the central @xmath162@xmath12 kpc region . the xis result for",

    "in fact , by performing a ray tracing simulation ( see  3.1.2 for more details ) , the outer xis bin at @xmath85@xmath12 kpc was found to be contaminated by photons scattered from the inner regions , in such a way that @xmath164% of the emission in this region actually comes from the central 144@xmath12 kpc . in this case , a weighted mean of @xmath165 measured with the xis over inner @xmath163@xmath12 kpc and @xmath166 measured with the other two missions at the @xmath85@xmath12 kpc region becomes @xmath167 , in agreement with the outer xis point .",

    "( 2004 ) , which also shows a two - temperature structure ( 2.5 kev and 4.9 kev , see their table 6 ) in the cluster center .",
    "hence , the xis data prefers the discrete 2p model , to a continuous temperature distribution , although the latter can not be ruled out based on available data .      as shown in figure 3_b _ , the deprojected metal abundance profiles appear roughly consistent between the 1p and 2p icm modelings (  3.1.1 and  3.1.2 , respectively ) .",
    "both profiles show a peak in the shell of @xmath69@xmath12 kpc , and a mild decline outwards .",
    "this abundance profile , however , should be regarded as an average among those of different elements , because we have so far assumed the solar abundance ratios . to examine the icm for possible deviation from the solar ratios , we employed two vapec models and reran the deprojected 2p fittings of the  xis spectra extracted from the central 320@xmath12 kpc region .",
    "specifically , we left the abundances of o , mg , si and fe free , fixed the abundances of he , c and n at the solar value ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , and tied the abundance of ni to that of fe and those of other elements ( ne , al , s , ar and ca ) to that of si .",
    "this model gave nearly the same set of temperatures for the 2p icm , and a fit goodness ( @xmath173 ) slightly better than that of the best - fit apec model ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "as shown in table 3 , the best - fit fe and si abundances increase significantly towards the center , while the o and mg abundances are nearly constant throughout the cluster .",
    "this confirms the previous acis result reported in ettori et al .",

    "regardless of the 1p or 2p modeling , the acis and xis fitting results revealed a significant excess absorption by @xmath176 @xmath45 ( table 3 ) beyond the galactic value of @xmath177 @xmath45 , at least in the central 30@xmath12 kpc region .",
    "the excess absorption could not be mitigated by varying the abundances of specific elements ( e.g. , oxygen ) whose emission lines couple with the absorption feature .",

    "the primary purpose of 2-d spectral analysis is to assess the validity of spherically symmetric temperature distribution that we assumed in the radial 1p/2p analysis . to do this , we examined the obtained 1p temperature map for any significant anisotropic distribution . as shown in figure 6_a _",
    ", the 1p temperature distribution in the cluster central region exhibits an approximate elliptical symmetry ; the temperature variation in the azimuthal direction is about 0.5 kev , 1.0 kev , and 1.0 kev at @xmath204@xmath12 kpc , @xmath205@xmath12 kpc , and @xmath162@xmath12 kpc , respectively , which is insufficient , at least by a factor of three , to imitate the obtained 2p icm condition .",
    "similar morphology is seen in the @xmath184/@xmath185 map of the core region as shown in figure 7_b_. this confirms that the 2p view is not an artifact caused by a 1p icm with large azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "it also indicates that the two phases , in terms of the 2p view , must be separated on scales smaller than the spatial resolution allowed by the present analysis ( @xmath65@xmath12 kpc ) .",

    "given the temperature difference of about 2 kev , the hot structure is significant over the ambient on 90% confidence level .",
    "this feature agrees with a high temperature bin ( @xmath75@xmath12 kpc ) on the deprojected acis temperature profile shown in figure 3_a_. a same high temperature structure was found by markevitch et al .",

    "comparing to the @xmath222 , the @xmath227 profile shows a significant excess within 100@xmath12 kpc , reconfirming the result that cool - phase icm is indeed more metal - rich .",
    "given the detected correlation , the assumption made in  3.1.2 and  3.1.6 that the two phases icm have approximately the same abundances may not stand now .",
    "therefore , we refitted the deprojected xis spectra of the central @xmath163@xmath12 kpc region with the 2p icm ( vapec + vapec ) + 0.8 kev component ( apec ; 0.5 @xmath51 ) model , same as the one in  3.1.6 , except that the iron abundances of the cool and hot phases were let float separately .",
    "the absorption column densities of the three components were again tied together in the fitting as a free parameter .",
    "we found that the abundance of cool phase icm ( @xmath228 ) does appear higher than that of the hot one ( @xmath229 ) ; i.e. , ( @xmath230 ) = ( @xmath231 , @xmath232 ) @xmath51 .",
    "compared to the model presented in  3.1.6 ( table 3 ) , the current model improves fit goodness to @xmath233 from @xmath234 , with a probability of @xmath235 for the improvement to be caused by chance .    following , e.g. , simionescu et al .

    "the icm therein can be characterized by two representative temperatures , @xmath333 kev and @xmath334 kev for the hot and cool phases , respectively , whose @xmath25 kev luminosities were estimated to be @xmath335 ergs @xmath9 and @xmath336 ergs @xmath46 .",

    "as shown in figure 9 , the total gravitating mass profile exhibits a central mass excess ( @xmath338 ) , which has a similar spatial scale to the region of clear 2p property .",
    "this indicates a potential hierarchy , with a 100@xmath12 kpc level halo nested in the center of a cluster - scale one .    as shown in figure 3_b",

    "the 2-d maps also revealed a filamentary distribution of the cool , metal - rich gas in this region .",

    "such a picture resembles the previous findings of the metal - rich , multi - phase arms in m87 ( simionescu et al .",

    "i.e. , @xmath340@xmath12 kpc , however , a dip is seen in the abundance distribution , which does not correlate with the cool phase fraction .",
    "such a feature is also seen in the coolest spots of some other clusters , while its origin still remains unclear ( e.g. , sanders et al . 2006 ) .    in  3.1.3 and",
    " 3.1.5 , we showed that the xis and rgs spectra of the central 144@xmath12 kpc region can be better reproduced by including an additional weak 0.8 kev component , without significantly revising the properties of the cool and hot icm components .",
    "this 0.8 kev component has a @xmath25 kev luminosity of @xmath135 ergs @xmath9 , and is dimmer than the hot icm component by two orders of magnitude . since the temperature and luminosity of this component are consistent with those of an x - ray / h@xmath282 filament in the core of a1795 as reported in fabian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the 0.8 kev emission might be associated with a portion of ism of the cd galaxy , which is presumably confined within some filamentary magnetic structures .",
    "the 2p formalism has also been successful for the central region of the centaurus cluster , as firstly reported by fukazawa et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and ikebe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with _ asca _ data , and recently reinforced by takahashi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using _ xmm - newton_. according to takahashi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the cool phase and hot phase coexist and dominate in the central 70@xmath12 kpc of the centaurus cluster , exhibiting a temperature ratio @xmath341 .",
    "these properties are analogous to those of a1795 . in addition , a similar central excess in the total gravitating mass profile , with a radius of 50@xmath12 kpc , has also been found in the centaurus cluster ( ikebe et al .",
    "thus , the two clusters are very similar in the icm properties , as well as in the total mass distribution .    as shown in  3.1.4 and figure 4_b _ , the cool ( @xmath342 kev ) phase component of a1795 occupies up to only 20% volume even in the innermost region , and in figure 6 and 7 , no apparent separation on the spatial distribution is seen between the cool phase and hot phase icm in the cluster core .",
    "this indicates that the cool phase is substantially mixed into the surrounding hot phase , instead of forming any `` cool - phase - only '' core on scale of @xmath343@xmath12 kpc .",
    "since such a 2p structure is seen predominately around a cd galaxy , with an enhanced metallicity ( particularly in the cool phase ) , the phenomenon is very likely related to the cd galaxy .",
    "one possible formation mechanism of the 2p structure could be an agn - driven gas transport . as indicated by numerical simulations , e.g. , churazov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and guo & mathews ( 2010 ) , the buoyant bubbles created by agn outbursts can drag a certain amount of surrounding cool , metal - rich gas to larger radii .",
    "for example , the icm in central 30@xmath12 kpc regions of the hydra a cluster and m87 are known to be in a 2p or multi - phase form ( ikebe et al .",
    "1997 ; molendi 2002 ) .",
    "more recently , the distributions of cool phase icm were found to coincide with the powerful radio lobes and x - ray cavities , hence , the bubble uplifting model has successfully been invoked for both hydra a cluster and m87 ( nulsen et al .",
    "2002 ; simionescu et al .",
    "these properties may be useful to explain the origin of the co - existing 2p icm .",
    "as for a1795 , by adopting the obtained distributions of total gravitating mass and cool phase gas mass ( @xmath286 and @xmath344 , respectively ;  3.3.2 ) , the energy required to uplift the cool component from cd galaxy center to current position ( average @xmath345@xmath12 kpc ) is estimated as @xmath346 ergs , which is consistent with the amount of mechanical energy injected from its central agn outburst ( rafferty et al .",
    "2006 ) . nevertheless , the faint x - ray cavity detected in a1795 is located @xmath347@xmath12 kpc from the center ( birzan et al . 2004 ) , apparently much smaller than the radius of the cool phase icm as shown in the obtained 2-d temperature and the @xmath184/@xmath185 maps ( fig . 6 & 7 ) .",
    "hence the appearance of the 2p icm can not be solely ascribed to bubble uplifting via recent agn activity .",
    "neither can the cool phase icm be bubble remnant , since the uplifted gas would conductively mix and reach thermal equilibrium with the surrounding hot phase icm quickly , i.e. , within @xmath348 yrs ( e.g. , simionescu et al . 2008 ) , after the bubble is torn apart .",
    "the most natural and effective way to sustain a stable 2p structure is to separate the two icm phases by magnetic fields .",
    "in such a case , the two phases become thermally insulated with each other , since the gyroradius of a thermal electron in a @xmath349 @xmath350 g field is smaller than its mean free path by about @xmath351 orders of magnitude ( sarazin 1988 ) . actually , cluster central regions are often threaded by rather strong ( @xmath5 @xmath350 g ; ge & owen 1993 ) magnetic fields , which are possibly related to the cd galaxy . employing a general topological classification of such cd - galaxy - related magnetic field lines into closed and open ones , makishima et al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed that the closed loops ( with their both ends anchored to the cd galaxy ) are filled with the cool phase icm , while the open - line regions , connecting to outer regions , are permeated by the hot phase .",
    "thus , the cool phase component is expected to emerge as numerous filamentary substructures in the core region , while the hot phase distributes throughout the vast cluster volume .",
    "in addition , the cool phase is naturally more metal - rich than the hot phase in this scenario , as the supernova yield of the cd galaxy may be largely confined within the loops ( takahashi et al .",
    "2009 ) , which are surrounded by intruding , less contaminated hot phase icm .",
    "this `` cd corona '' model is expected to provide a natural account for the appearance of metal - rich cool phase icm in the center of a1795 .    as the cool phase is thermally insulated from the hot phase , and the radiative transport between the two phases",
    "can be ignored ( sarazin 1988 ) , a continuous , efficient heating source located in the central region is required to prevent it from collapsing due to radiative cooling ( see aschwanden et al .",
    "2001 for a review ) . as first pointed out by rosner , tucker & vaiana ( 1978 ; hereafter rtv ) for solar corona , and applied successfully to the centaurus cluster by takahashi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , a loop structure as illustrated in figure 11 has a built - in feedback mechanism to maintain thermal stability for the cool phase plasma . in order to characterize the loop heating mechanism in a quantitative way",
    ", we employed an updated version of rtv model , an analytical solution to the hydrostatic model introduced in aschwanden & schrijver ( 2002 ; as02 hereafter ) for solar corona and applied it to the 2p icm . this model considers a thin , arch - like loop delineating magnetic field lines , for which the pressure between the loop - interior and surrounding plasmas are in equilibrium . to constrain the temperature and density structures of the loop , as02 assumed mass and momentum conservations along the loop , as well as a total energy balance involving radiative loss rate , heating rate , and thermal conductive flux .",
    "the heating rate function has been defined in form of @xmath352 @xmath353 , where @xmath354 is heating rate at the bottom of loop , @xmath355 is the height in the loop plane , and @xmath356 is the scale height of the heating source ( fig .",
    "the analytic solution by as02 gave a loop temperature distribution increasing with @xmath355 in general , and the exact temperature gradient was predicted to be sensitive to the heating scale @xmath356 . as shown in figure 9 of as02 , for a uniform heating , i.e. , @xmath357 , where @xmath358 is the loop height , the loop temperature exhibits a mild decrease towards the loop bottom by @xmath359% , while for a small scale heating at the bottom , i.e. , @xmath360 , a large part of the loop becomes near isothermal , with only a sharp , small - scale temperature drop seen at the footpoints .",
    "such a loop also obey a scaling law , as defined in eq.(29 ) of as02 ( also see eq.19 below ) , which describes the loop maximum temperature @xmath361 as a function of @xmath356 , @xmath358 , and external pressure at footpoint @xmath362 .",
    "another important property of the loop - confined plasma is that , as shown in eq.(30 ) of as02 , @xmath361 shows rather weak dependence on the heating rate @xmath363 , i.e. , @xmath364 , because a decrease ( or increase ) in @xmath363 will make the loop thinner ( or thicker ) , so as to keep the plasma luminosity nearly equal to @xmath363 .",

    "this 2p model provides significantly better fit to the deprojected spectra than the 1p model with continuous temperature profile , while the latter can not be fully ruled out based on current data . combining the _ suzaku _ xis and the _ xmm - newton _ epic & rgs , we have marginally detected a third weak 0.8 kev component in the inner 144@xmath12 kpc region that can be ascribed to a portion of ism component of the cd galaxy .",

    "<S> based on a detailed analysis of the high - quality _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ suzaku _ data of the x - ray bright cluster of galaxies abell 1795 , we report clear evidence for a two - phase intracluster medium ( icm ) structure , which consists of a cool ( with a temperature @xmath0 kev ) and a hot ( @xmath1 kev ) component that coexist and dominate the x - ray emission at least in the central 80 kpc . a third weak emission component ( @xmath2 kev ) is also detected within the innermost 144 kpc and is ascribed to a portion of inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of the cd galaxy . </S>",

    "<S> , we find that the cool phase component is more metal - enriched than the hot phase one in @xmath3 kpc region , which agrees with that found in m87 ( simionescu et al . 2008 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence of the cool phase and hot phase icm can not be realized by bubble uplifting from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) alone . instead , the two - phase icm properties are better reconciled with a cd corona model ( makishima et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , the cool phase may be ascribed to the plasmas confined in magnetic loops , which are surrounded by the intruding hot phase icm and have been polluted by metals synthesized in the cd galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> agn feedback energy released in the innermost 10 kpc can serve as the heating source to prevent the loop - interior gas from cooling down to temperatures much lower than the observed value . </S>",
