    "evidence for a smaller belr has prompted the idea of belr microlensing to be revisited .",
    "in general , the magnitude of differential magnification of the belr and continuum region depends on both the optical depth in compact lenses and the size of the projected microlens einstein radius relative to the source @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that microlensing of the belr can be important in the case of a single microlens object .",

    "2237 + 0305 was observed on 2002 july 16 and 17 ( program i d : gn-2002a - q-40 ) using the gmos ifu on the 8 m gemini north telescope .",
    "three 30min exposures were taken on the 16th and five 30min exposures on the 17th using a random dither pattern with average step size @xmath12 arcsec .",
    "the r400 grating was used which gave a useful spectral range between 450 - 800 nm with resolution 0.068 nm / pixel .",
    "the gmos ifu @xcite is an array of hexagonal lenslets with projected diameter 0.2 arcsec .",
    "we used the ifu in ` one - slit ' mode which images a @xmath13 arcsec section of the sky .",
    "an additional @xmath14 arcsec array , separated by approx 1 arcmin from the main array , is used for sky subtraction .",
    "the five exposures taken on 2002 july 17 are of much better quality than the three from the previous night , so we use only those in the following analysis .",
    "the seeing during these observations was 0.65 arcsec .",
    "[ fig : ifu_lenslets ] shows an image of the total flux in each lenslet for one of the exposures .",
    "the data were reduced with the gemini iraf package v1.4 using iraf v2.11.3b .",
    "the reduction tasks include bias subtraction , flatfielding , arc calibration , spectra extraction , sky subtraction and flux calibration .",
    "cosmic ray rejection was performed using custom iraf scripts based on simple median filtering .",
    "this produced cleaner cosmic ray rejection than the gemini iraf task ` gscrrej ' .",
    "the images were extracted independently and 5 data cubes were generated using ` gfcube ' which subsamples the hexagonal array into a 0.1 arcsec pixel@xmath9 rectangular array .",
    "[ fig : ifu_lenslets ] shows that the qso images are well separated and there is good sampling ( at least 5 lenslets ) between each qso image and about 5 lenslets between the galaxy centre and the nearest qso image ( image c ) .",
    "[ fig : example_spectra ] shows example spectra taken from the centre of qso image a and from the centre of the lens galaxy .",
    "the redshifted ciii ]  and mgii  lines are clearly seen in the qso spectrum but are barely visible in the spectrum from the galaxy .",
    "the reddest edge of the mgii  broad line is absorbed by the atmosphere around 760 nm .",
    "these spectra show that the qso images and galaxy have been well resolved by the ifu .",
    "we note that the instrument was not corrected for atmospheric dispersion , which shifted the locations of the qso images by approximately one lenslet at the wavelengths of the two emission lines .",
    "however , the following analysis is not affected by the dispersion .        for each exposure , the ciii ]  and mgii  line flux were summed between ( 507.9 nm , 520.8 nm ) for ciii ]  and ( 747.8 nm , 758.5 nm ) for mgii .",
    "we also calculated the total continuum flux for ciii ]  between ( 501.3 nm , 507.8 nm and 520.9 nm , 527.3 nm ) and mgii  between ( 742.2 nm , 747.8 nm and 768.4 nm , 774.0 nm avoiding the sky absorption ) resulting in four images per exposure : one each for the ciii ]  line  plus  continuum , mgii  line  plus  continuum , the continuum around the ciii ]  line and the continuum around the mgii  line .",
    "we then subtracted the continuum images from the line  plus ",
    "continuum images to make images of the integrated line flux .",
    "we use the integrated flux in the line rather than the equivalent width because an equivalent width measurement is susceptible to different lensing magnification between the belr and the continuum regions in the qso .",
    "the continuum subtraction process was very clean , leaving no trace of the galaxy emission in the centre of the images .",
    "in each line and continuum image , the four qso images are clearly resolved with a stable psf .",
    "there were some small variations in the psf between images , but it was reassuring to find that each of the line flux images looked almost identical except for the dither step offsets .",
    "the ciii ]  images were somewhat noisier than the mgii  due to the lower signal / noise in the blue end of the spectra .",
    "we then combined the total line flux images and the continuum images , using the known dither steps , for all five ciii ]  and mgii  images , resulting in two final line flux images ( hereafter ` ciii ]  line ' and ` mgii  line ' ) and two final continuum images ( hereafter ` ciii ]  cont ' and ` mgii  cont ' ) .",
    "the resulting continuum and line images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lineflux_contours ] .",
    "it can be seen immediately that the qso images are well separated and that the galaxy has disappeared in the line images .",
    "the arc joining a and d is consistent with psf overlap , not a lensed arc which we would expect to be much more circular .",
    "there is certainly nothing resembling the relatively bright arc as seen by m98 .    in the next section ,",
    "we subtract the qso images to look for any faint resolved line emission .",
    "due to varying atmospheric conditions , there are likely to be large differences between the standard star used for flux calibration and the psf of the science observations .",
    "we therefore elected to reconstruct the psf from the four qso images .",
    "the light from the lensing galaxy is already subtracted in the line images , so extraction of the psf is a matter of deconvolving four point sources .",
    "we achieve this through an iterative approach and produced a psf for each of the line images .",
    "first , we constructed a trial psf by defining apertures of 0.8 - 0.9 arcsec ( depending on brightness ) for each image , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf_areas ] .",
    "the regions covered by only a single aperture are considered uncontaminated , and are shifted and combined to produce our trial psf , with each segment normalised according to the relative fluxes in the regions where the sampled regions overlap .",
    "this psf was then used to find the fluxes of the four images using the @xmath15 statistic to minimise residuals .",
    "these fluxes were used to create four separate subtracted images . in each of these",
    "a single qso image is left unsubtracted .",
    "we then repeated the first step , constructing a new psf using the same uncontaminated regions to sample each of these four lens images .",
    "the trial psf converged after only a few iterations , resulting in the residual maps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf_sub_resid ] . note that any flux from a possible faint arc between images a and d fall into an overlapping region , so does not affect the result .",
    "using the constructed psf , a scaled psf was subtracted from each qso line image such that the @xmath15 residual over the image was minimised .",
    "the qso - subtracted residual for each line image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf_sub_resid ] .",
    "( we show the residuals as images because contour plots are difficult to interpret . )",
    "the peak(rms ) of the residual , compared to the peak in the line image , was 9.9(1.4 ) and 4.5(0.5 ) percent for ciii ]  and mgii  respectively .",
    "this compares well to the rms noise in the line images ( computed using pixel values in the corners of the images far from the bright regions ) , of 1.2 and 0.2 percent .",
    "we note that the residuals were worst between the qso images ( i.e. around the centre of the lens galaxy ) where the most psf overlap occurs . in the ciii ]  residual , the region between the images is slightly over - subtracted , whereas in the mgii  image it is slightly under - subtracted .",
    "these are artifacts of an imperfect psf subtraction .",
    "most importantly , there is no evidence for any extended emission ( arcs or rings ) joining the qso images .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the images of the qso belr are unresolved .",
    "the difference between this data and m98 is very important for the determination of size of the belr .",
    "possible explanations for why an arc was seen by m98 include poorer spatial resolution , seeing or telescope / instrumental effects .",
    "the integral ifu @xcite ( with sb1 package ) used by m98 has circular lenslets separated by 0.5 arcsec and a 65% filling factor .",
    "since flux is lost between fibres and the separation between images a / d and b / d is @xmath16 arcsec , we would argue that the total flux and positions of the qso images can not be determined reliably in 0.7  seeing because the psf is under - sampled .",
    "there is ( in the best case ) only one fibre between images a / d and b / d with integral , so flux from surrounding images must leak into this fibre in 0.7 arcsec seeing .",
    "after interpolating , such leakage could easily look like an arc .",
    "the gmos ifu , on the other hand , has at least five lenslets between images and our data have not been interpolated after resampling the 0.2 arcsec hexagonal lenslets into a 0.1 arcsec pixel@xmath9 rectangular array .",
    "( left ) and mgii  ( right ) psf subtraction .",
    "the white triangles show the positions of the qso images before subtraction . ]",
    "in the previous section the belr was found to be unresolved in both the ciii ]  and mgii  lines for the qso .",
    "a test for any significant difference in the size and/or location of emitting regions for the two lines is in the measurement of the flux ratios between images for each line .",
    "if the emitting regions are of significantly different size ( or not co - located on the line - of - sight ) , then microlensing will produce different magnifications .",
    "microlensing has already been shown to change the equivalent width of the emission lines over time @xcite , however the equivalent width can be changed by microlensing of the continuum region alone .",
    "table [ tab : photometry ] shows the relative amplitude of the psf used to subtract each qso image in section [ sec : psf_sub ] .",
    "given the qso images are unresolved , the psf magnitude is a photometric measurement which can then be used to calculate the ratio of fluxes ( hence magnifications ) between the qso images . to calculate the flux ratios of the continuum data ,",
    "the same procedure used for the psf subtraction in section [ sec : psf_sub ] was employed , with an additional component for the galaxy bulge light .",
    "we used a de vaucouleurs model with scale length , position angle 77and axis ratio 0.69 @xcite which is convolved with the constructed psf .",
    "all five components are fit to minimise the @xmath15 residual as before .",
    "the continuum flux measurements are also shown in table [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "the ( not de - reddened ) flux ratios for these measurements are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_ratio_noext ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this leads to the following conclusions : i ) the sizes and locations of the belrs for the ciii ]  and mgii  lines are very similar , because they appear to be subject to the same amount of microlensing , ii ) the belr must be microlensed because the flux ratios for the line images are substantially different to the radio , mid - ir and previous narrow band fluxes and iii ) the continuum region is a substantially different size to the belr .",
    "it is interesting that the line flux ratios of the @xmath17 broad line in @xcite differ from this work ( albeit at a low significance ) .",
    "the two independent sets of observations were separated in time by only 25 days which should be too short for significant changes in either the luminosity or the magnification of the belr to occur .",
    "this suggests that the section of the belr emitting @xmath17 may be different to that of ciii ]  and mgii , consistent with a stratified belr model .",
    "it is possible that the results in @xcite were affected by the poor psf of those observations .",
    "nevertheless , it is intriguing and certainly warrants further investigation .",
    "for a large source ( relative to the projected einstein radius of the microlensing stars ) , the flux ratio should be that predicted by the macro - model for the lensing galaxy ( approx 0.7 - 1.0 depending on the model .",
    "[ e.g : @xcite for a surface brightness based model , and @xcite for a parametric model ] . as the source size decreases , the impact of microlensing on the flux ratio increases .",
    "an estimate can be made of the sizes of the belr and the continuum region using fig . 2 from @xcite which plots the cumulative probability of observing a b / a flux ratio as a function of the source size ( measured in units of the projected microlens einstein radius @xmath18 , which is @xmath19pc in this case ) .",
    "this figure shows that for a source size of 0.4@xmath20 , the flux ratio should be @xmath21 80 percent of the time and @xmath22 20 percent of the time .",
    "likewise , if the source size is 1.6@xmath20 , then the flux ratio should be @xmath23 80 percent of the time and @xmath24 20 percent of the time .",
    "if it is 6.4@xmath20 or larger then the flux ratio should never be @xmath21 .",
    "hence , there is only a limited range of values for the source size that are likely to produce a b / a flux ratio of 0.5 , and an upper limit to the size which can produce a ratio of 0.25 or 0.5 .",
    "a cumulative probability of 0.5 gives the most likely value for the flux ratio which , interpolating between the s=0.4 and s=1.6 curves , is s @xmath25 for a flux ratio of 0.5 .",
    "reading from this figure , the following conclusions can be made : i ) for the b / a flux ratio to be 0.5 , the emitting region is between 0.4 and 6.4 @xmath20 with 80 percent confidence and is likely to be @xmath26pc , and ii ) for the b / a flux ratio to be @xmath27 , the continuum region is @xmath28 pc with 80 percent confidence and is likely to be @xmath29",
    ". these determinations for the size of the belr are inconsistent with m98 .",
    "if the belr has a physical size of order kpc as suggested by m98 , then the flux ratios can not be affected by microlensing or millilensing and the lensed images of the qso belrs should be distorted by the macro lensing .",
    "hence we conclude that the belr can not be as large as m98 suggest .",
    "we note that the estimates presented here are based on the assumptions in @xcite , in particular that the surface brightness of the emitting region is a smooth gaussian .",

    "we observed the q2237 + 0305 using the gmos ifu on the 8 m gemini north telescope .",
    "the gmos ifu is an ideal instrument for observing lensed qsos with hexagonal lenslets separated by 0.2 arcsec .",

    "the qso images were subtracted , leaving no significant residual ( resolved ) flux .",
    "we concluded that the arc of emission seen by @xcite was probably an artifact generated by poor spatial sampling in the integral ifu .",

    "the flux ratios for the broad line images are consistent with each other , but are inconsistent with both the continuum flux ratios ( from this data ) and previously published work .",
    "this strongly suggests that the belr must be microlensed , but to a different degree than the qso continuum region",
    ". the identical flux ratios of the ciii ]  and mgii  lines also suggest the emitting regions for the two lines are the same size and located along the same line - of - sight . using previous results on the likelihood of observing a particular b / a flux ratio , we estimated the size of the ciii]/mgii  belr to be @xmath0 pc in size and the continuum region is @xmath1 pc .",
