    "<S> the distributions of photon flux is computed in light - cone perturbation theory and the cross section of photon - nucleus scatterings is calculated in dipole model , we assume that the two gluons exchange contribution is the coherent cross section and the large-@xmath1 contribution is the incoherent cross section in photon - nucleus scattering . the numerical result of the rapidity distributions of @xmath0 production in pbpb ultraperipheral collisions at @xmath2tev are compared with the experimental data measured by the alice collaboration . </S>"
