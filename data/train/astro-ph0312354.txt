    "the spectroscopic study of globular cluster ( gc ) systems has made great progress in the past few years .",
    "the availability of 10 metre class telescopes , and efficient spectrographs , has meant that it is now possible to obtain low - resolution spectra of individual gcs of sufficient quality to derive reliable abundance and age information ( in addition to valuable kinematic information ) out to virgo cluster distances . however , such studies still only number a handful , and have largely focused on the rich cluster systems of giant elliptical galaxies ( ngc  4486 : 1998 ; ngc  1399 : 1998 ; 2001 ; ngc  4472 : 2000 ; 2003 , see also ( 2003 ) for a recent study of ngc  5128 ) .",
    "such studies have afforded unique insights into both the individual properties of gc systems associated with ellipticals , and the relation between gcs and the formation of their host galaxies .",
    "the results of these previous works have shown that the gcs possess metallicities ranging from 1/400 to approximately solar values , with these most metal - rich gcs comparable to the integrated bulge starlight of their host galaxies . moreover , within the uncertainties ( which remain necessarily model - dependent ) , many of gcs in these galaxies appear old and coeval .",
    "recent spectroscopic data ( 2001 ; 2003 ) and ir imaging ( 2002 ; 2002 ) have indicated the presence of young gcs in apparently otherwise undisturbed elliptical galaxies , suggesting complex formation histories for at least a subset of ellipticals .    the situation for disk galaxies is even less well known . larsen ( 2002 ) presented a spectroscopic study of a small sample of high s / n sombrero galaxy ( m104 ) gcs , and found that the clusters in this relatively luminous ( m@xmath16 = 21.8 ) sa spiral appear old and coeval , similar to the milky way cluster system .",
    "these authors found alpha - to - iron ratios for the clusters of [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath4 + 0.4 , typical of luminous galaxy spheroids ( 1998 ) .",
    "recently , ( 2002 ) have obtained high - quality spectra for 17 gcs in the nearby ( @xmath4 10 mpc ) lenticular galaxy ngc  3115 .",
    "similar to the sombrero gcs , the gcs in ngc  3115 generally appear old , although interestingly , ( 2002 ) were able to demonstrate a spread in [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios amongst both the metal - rich and metal - poor gcs , indicative of multiple phases of gc formation .",
    "these latter results are particularly intriguing , since we know that the milky way gcs are old ( i.e. @xmath17 8 gyr , 2002 ) and generally exhibit non - solar [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios ( 2001 ) .",
    "clearly few firm conclusions can be drawn from such a small and restricted sample , and more information is required with regards to late - type galaxies .",
    "ngc  524 is an sa(rs)0 galaxy , dominating the small ngc  524 group some 28.2 mpc distant @xcite .",
    "its gc system was first studied in any detail by ( 1985 ) , who identified a rich , and spatially extended system .",
    "in fact it possesses one of the richest gc systems known for an s0 galaxy , with 4430 @xmath18 950 gcs @xcite .",
    "more recently , the gc system of ngc  524 has been studied with /wfpc2 by ( 2001 ) . from two pointings they identified a total of 617 gcs to a magnitude limit of @xmath19 26 . employing the kmm test",
    "@xcite these authors determined the gc colour distribution to be bimodal with peaks at @xmath20 = 0.98 and @xmath20 = 1.19 in the ratio @xmath4 2:1 . using the colour - metallicity relation of ( 1998 ) , these peaks correspond to sub - populations with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 1.3 and 0.6 .    in this paper , we present an analysis of the broad - band imaging and spectroscopy for gc candidates associated with this galaxy , the first such study to spectroscopically investigate the gc system of ngc  524 .",
    "this paper is ordered in the following way : in @xmath21  [ observations ] we discuss the data acquisition and reduction procedures .",
    "next , in @xmath21  [ indices ] , we derive metallicities from our integrated spectra , and compare line - strength indices of the clusters to stellar population models . in @xmath21  [ radial ]",
    "we then investigate the kinematical properties of the cluster system and sub - populations , and derive dynamical mass estimates for ngc  524 .",
    "finally , we present a summary and our conclusions in @xmath21  [ conclusions ] .",
    "broad  band imaging of ngc  524 in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 filters was obtained at the keck - i telescope in 1996 , september 8th using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; 1995 ) .",
    "the lris instrument , equipped with a tek @xmath25 ccd , is mounted on the cassegrain focus providing a @xmath26 imaging scale and a @xmath27 field  of  view .",
    "the total exposure times were 630 secs in @xmath22 , 330 secs in @xmath23 and 300 secs in @xmath24 .",
    "seeing conditions were good , with a median of @xmath4 0.6 arcsec .",
    "these data were reduced following standard procedures , using iraf software .",
    "the reduced images were found to be flat to better than @xmath28 .",
    "photometric calibration was performed using standard stars from ( 1992 ) .",
    "selection of gc candidates from our lris multi - filter imaging was undertaken using the following selection criteria : 20.5 @xmath29 24 , 0.5 @xmath30 2.0 and 0 @xmath31 1.0 .",
    "the magnitude limits ensured that we selected the more luminous gcs ( necessary for spectroscopy ) whilst excluding bright foreground stars .",
    "the colour cuts covered the full range expected for gcs including photometric errors , whilst excluding extremely blue objects which were unlikely to be real gcs .",
    "after these selection criteria , we were left with a total of 245 gc candidates .    in figure",
    "[ fig : colours ] we show the colour distribution of our 245 gc candidates in ngc 524 ( open histogram ) and those for which we have obtained lris spectra ( filled histogram ) .",
    "the distribution shows a broad peak at @xmath32 1.0 , with possible enhancements at @xmath32 0.9 and 1.1 , similar to those seen in the hst data of ( 2001 ) . in an effort to obtain spectra of some very metal - rich gcs",
    ", we also selected a number of candidates at @xmath32 1.8 .",
    "these turned out to be _ bona fide _ gcs , although not with the high metallicities expected for these extremely red colours ( see section  [ metallicities ] ) .",
    "spectra of gc candidates around ngc 524 were obtained with lris on the keck - i telescope .",
    "candidate selection was based on the imaging data , and was designed to cover a wide range of potential gc candidates .",
    "observations consisted of two masks obtained on the nights of 1997 september 30th and october 1st .",
    "the two masks used the same setup and had comparable exposure times ( 10,800 and 9,000 sec ) .",
    "the 600  l / mm grating used yielded a spectral resolution of 5.6 , with a full wavelength range of 3640   6200 .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the redux software package developed by a. phillips .",
    "data reduction steps included trimming these data , bias - subtraction , flat - fielding , removal of any @xmath33 and @xmath34distortions , and producing optimally sky - subtracted , 1-d spectra .",
    "comparison lamp spectra of mercury , argon , neon and krypton were used for wavelength calibration .",
    "spectra from the different nights were combined .",
    "flux calibration was provided by the flux standard bd  284211 observed on the first night of the run .    in table",
    "[ tab : candidates ] we summarise the observational data for the objects for which we have obtained keck spectra .",
    "the @xmath35,@xmath36 & @xmath37 photometry derived from our 1996 lris observations were described in section  [ photometry ] .",
    "radial velocities and velocity uncertainties were measured from the spectra by cross - correlating against high s / n m31 gc templates ( 225 - 280 ) and ( 158 - 213 ) ( using the nomenclature for the m31 gcs from 1991 ) , observed with the same instrumental set - up , using fxcor in iraf .",
    "the zero - points of these velocities were checked against 1.8  resolution synthetic spectra @xcite , broadened to the lris resolution .",
    "of the 41 usable spectra obtained , 3 were galactic stars , 9 were background galaxies and 29 _ bona fide _ gcs .",
    "thus our magnitude and colour selection cuts have a contamination rate of about 30% .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : kinematics ]    these results hint at either different density profiles or different families of orbits for the gc sub - populations ( see 1998 for a similar situation in m87 ) .",
    "the most likely explanation is that this is due to the metal - poor clusters having a flatter density distribution than the metal - rich clusters , as observed in luminous galaxies ( see 2001 for the specific case of ngc  4472 ) .",
    "however , it does remain puzzling why the metal - poor globular clusters rotate at a right angle with respect to the stellar light of ngc  524 .",
    "integral field data available for this galaxy ( see 2002 ) will clarify whether or not it is connected to the kinematically decoupled core .",
    "clearly a larger sample of radial velocities for the ngc  524 gcs is desirable for a more detailed analysis of these issues .",
    "globular clusters can be used to good effect as test - particles to probe the gravitational potential of their parent galaxies ( 1997 ; 1998 ; 2000 ) , and are complementary to other techniques such as studies of planetary nebulae ( 1995 ; 1998 ) and integrated light ( 1984 ; 1994 ) .",
    "our present spectroscopic sample allows us to estimate the total mass of the galaxy within a radius of @xmath4 200 , within roughly 2 effective radii ( @xmath4 26 kpc ) of ngc  524 . for this purpose",
    "we used the virial ( vme ) and projected ( pme ) mass estimators , as described in ( 1981 ) and ( 1985 ) respectively . with our adopted distance to ngc 524 of 28.2 mpc @xcite , we obtain masses of @xmath38 m@xmath39 ( vme ) and between @xmath40 ( pme , purely tangential orbits ) and @xmath41 m@xmath39 ( pme , purely radial orbits ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : mass ] the various mass - solutions we obtain for this galaxy , resulting from our assumptions about the nature of the ngc  524 cluster orbits .",
    "we have obtained low - resolution spectra for 41 gc candidates associated with the lenticular galaxy ngc  524 . from this sample ,",
    "29 candidates are identified as genuine gcs on the basis of their radial velocities . deriving mean metallicities for the ngc  524 gcs",
    ", we find our sample spans a wide range in metallicity , with 2.0 @xmath0 [ fe / h ] @xmath0 0 .",
    "the individual s / n of our spectra are generally insufficient to derive useful age constraints , since we rely on age discrimination to come from individual indices ( h@xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore we have co - added the gcs into metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.0 ) and metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath43 1.0 ) composite gcs . from comparison with the stellar population models of ( 2000 ) , we find that the composite metal - rich and metal - poor gc sub - populations both appear old , and are coeval within the 2 @xmath2 uncertainties .    we have examined the abundance ratios of the ngc  524 gcs using the @xmath3-enhanced stellar population models of ( 2000 ) .",
    "the calibration of these models was first tested using a sample of high s / n galactic gc integrated spectra @xcite , which have independently determined [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios from high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we find that the model predictions are in good agreement with these literature values .",
    "comparing the ( 2000 ) models to our data , we find a weak trend of decreasing [ @xmath3/fe ] with increasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "this is supported by the co - added data , with the composite metal - poor gc possessing [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath4 0.3 , whereas the metal - rich composite gc shows [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath4 0.1 .",
    "the lower [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios of the metal - rich clusters may in fact reflect a mix of [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios ( sub - populations amongst the metal - rich clusters ) as found by ( 2002 ) for the lenticular galaxy ngc  3115 .",
    "we have also investigated the kinematics of the ngc  524 gc system .",
    "after the removal of one outlying gc , we obtain a velocity dispersion of @xmath7 .",
    "the entire cluster system shows a rotation of @xmath5 ( excluding the outlying cluster ) , around a position angle of @xmath6 . by separating the gc systems into metal - rich and metal - poor components ( at [ fe / h]=1.0 )",
    ", we find that the ngc  524 gc sub - populations potentially exhibit different kinematics .",
    "both sub - populations have similar ( neglecting rotation ) velocity dispersions ( @xmath9 and @xmath44 respectively ) , but the metal - poor clusters show signs of rotation ( @xmath45 ) , whereas the metal - rich clusters do not ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "finally , using the entire gc system , we derive a virial and projected mass estimation for ngc  524 of between 4 @xmath13 10@xmath14 @xmath15 and 13 @xmath13 10@xmath14 @xmath15 ( depending on the assumed orbital distribution ) interior to @xmath4 2 effective radii of this galaxy .",
