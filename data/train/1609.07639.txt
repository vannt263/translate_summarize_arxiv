    "ramsey theory has a rich history first popularized in 1935 by erds and szekeres in their seminal paper @xcite .",
    "we investigate a part of the theory that was orginally developed by issai schur .",
    "the formulation of schur s theorem was first derived from van der waerden s theorem in 1927 @xcite .",
    "van der waerden proved that any @xmath4-coloring of @xmath5 must admit a monochromatic 3-term arithmetic progression @xmath6 for some @xmath7 .",
    "a particular choice of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 admits a monochromatic solution to @xmath12 , on a plane whose coordinates are the positive integers .",
    "hence , a similar question regarding the coloring of monochromatic solutions to a simpler equation can be posed ; namely , does there exist a least positive integer @xmath13 such that for any @xmath4-coloring of @xmath14 $ ] there is a monochromatic solution to @xmath15 ?",
    "schur determined that the answer is yes , and we call the solution @xmath16 to such an equation a schur triple .    in 1959 , goodman @xcite was able to determine the minimum number of monochromatic triangles under a 2-edge coloring of a complete graph on @xmath17 vertices , which turned out to be the same order as the average , @xmath18 .",
    "this motivated graham @xcite to pose the problem of finding the minimum number of monochromatic schur triples over any 2-coloring of @xmath2 $ ] at a conference and to offer 100 usd for the result .",
    "graham initially conjectured that the average value should be the minimum at @xmath19 . however , zeilberger and his student robertson @xcite used discrete calculus to show that the minimum number must be @xmath20 and won the cash prize . around the same time ,",
    "schoen @xcite , followed four years later by datskovsky @xcite , furnished different proofs using fourier analysis to show that indeed , @xmath20 is the correct minimum . ultimately , their idea had reduced to one in combinatorics . more recently in 2009 , thanatiponanda @xcite confirmed the result using a new technique with computer algebra and a greedy algorithm .",
    "he conjectured a minimum number of monochromatic schur triples for all @xmath4-colorings and a minimum number of monochromatic triples satisfying @xmath21 for a fixed integer @xmath1 over any 2-coloring of @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "we solve the latter part of the conjecture in this paper using a purely combinatorial approach .",
    "we first show how to find the minimum coloring of @xmath22 in an elementary way using the method by datkovsky @xcite .",
    "then , we explore the more general case in the next two sections .",
    "we start by employing a 2-coloring on all integers in @xmath2 $ ] for @xmath23 and count the number of monochromatic schur triples @xmath16 where @xmath24 . denote the colors to be red ( @xmath25 ) and blue ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "note that @xmath40 .",
    "the set of non - monochromatic pairs in @xmath2\\times[1,n]$ ] will be denoted as @xmath41 . in particular , we denote two subsets as follows :    @xmath42 + @xmath43    ( , + 0.5)(,+0.5 ) node[right , scale=1]@xmath31 ; ( + 0.5,)(+0.5 , ) node[above , scale=1]@xmath44 ; ( -0.5,+0.5 ) node[below , scale=1 ] @xmath17 ; ( + 0.5,-0.5 ) node[left , scale=1 ] @xmath17 ; ( + 0.5,-0.5 )  ( -0.5,-0.5 ) ; ( + 0.5,+0.5 )  ( -0.5,-0.5 ) ; ( + 0.5,-0.5 )  ( -0.5,+0.5 ) ; ( -0.5,+0.5 )  ( -0.5,-0.5 ) ; ( 0,-1.5 ) node[scale=1]@xmath45 ; ( 0,+1.5 ) node[scale=1]@xmath46 ; ( + 2,-1 ) circle [ radius=0.1 ] ; ( -2,-1 ) circle [ radius=0.1 ] ; ( + 2,+1 ) circle [ radius=0.1 ] ; ( -2,+1 ) circle [ radius=0.1 ] ;    [ nonmono1 ] @xmath47",
