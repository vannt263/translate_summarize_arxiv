    "as the collision energy has increased with the advent of new relativistic heavy - ion accelerators , from ags energies ( @xmath14  gev ) to those achieved with the sps ( @xmath15  gev ) and recently with rhic ( @xmath16  gev ) , the system created in heavy - ion collisions has been found to evolve from one that is baryon rich to one dominated by mesons @xcite .",
    "this change is evident in the increase of central rapidity densities of emitted pions and kaons accompanied by the simultaneous shift of the net - baryon peak one or two units of rapidity down from beam rapidity . due to this shift",
    ", the net - baryon peak gradually moves from mid - rapidity ( ags and sps ) @xcite towards high rapidity ( rhic ) @xcite , leaving a relatively net - baryon poor region at mid - rapidity at the highest rhic energy .    at ags energies ,",
    "the observed ratio of strange particles to pions in a+a collisions is larger than that measured in either p+p or p+a collisions and this ratio increases significantly with beam energy @xcite .",
    "this behavior is understood within cascade models as arising from hadronic rescatterings involving heavy baryon resonances @xcite . in the sps energy range",
    "it is conjectured @xcite that the nuclear fireball undergoes a phase transition from bound hadronic matter to a deconfined quark - gluon plasma state ( qgp ) .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the observation that excitation functions of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ratios at mid - rapidity are found to peak around @xmath20  gev @xcite and then decrease slightly with increasing energy .",
    "the energy dependence of other observables , like the onset of a plateau for the inverse slope parameter of kaon spectra and a kink in the @xmath21 pion yields normalized to the number of participant nucleons @xmath22 , is also used to support the transition to a deconfined phase at @xmath20  gev @xcite .",
    "the gross features of the @xmath23 excitation function can be described in theoretical models , but additional features are needed to describe the data quantitatively .",
    "phenomenologically motivated thermal models can explain the observed behavior with the assumption of a qgp formed in the early stages of the collision @xcite .",
    "however , more recent thermal models are able to reproduce the horn structure of the excitation function by including higher hadronic resonant states without the assumption of a phase transition @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 ratio has a monotonically increasing energy dependence and is always lower than the @xmath17 ratio because of the larger share of strange quarks , which form baryons ( mainly @xmath25 s ) @xcite . from the top sps energy to the top rhic energy the @xmath17 ratio at mid - rapidity",

    "the identification of charged pions and kaons with the time - of - flight detectors was done by using cuts in ( @xmath32 ) space , where @xmath33 is determined for a given momentum @xmath34 by using the time of flight ( @xmath35 ) and the track path length(@xmath36 ) .",
    "momentum dependent three-@xmath37 cuts about the mean @xmath38 of a given species were applied with the additional condition that the level of contamination from other species at a given @xmath38 and @xmath34 is limited to 5% inside the cut .",

    "the contamination of kaons with pions unresolved in rich and protons unresolved in h2 depends on momentum and on relative particle abundances .",

    "invariant differential yields , @xmath48 , were constructed for each spectrometer setting and were corrected for geometrical acceptance , tracking and pid efficiency , contamination , in - flight weak decays and multiple scattering effects by using a monte carlo calculation simulating the geometry and tracking of the brahms detector system .",
    "the feed - down correction for charged pions originating from the weak decays of @xmath49 and @xmath25 was applied as described in reference @xcite and amounts to @xmath50 of the measured yield in mrs settings and @xmath51 in fs settings .",
    "the feed - down correction was applied directly to the @xmath52 integrated rapidity densities . by merging all of the spectrometer magnet settings ,",
    "invariant @xmath0 spectra were extracted in several rapidity intervals and fitted with different functions in order to extract the integrated yields ( see fig .",

    "this uncertainty is largest for pions because of their lowest average @xmath0 . in order to estimate the extrapolation uncertainty , we used both a power law distribution of the form @xmath57 and an @xmath31 exponential function to fit the pion spectra .",
    "of these two , the power law distribution gives the best fit to the experimental results over the observed momentum range , and for very low @xmath58  gev/@xmath40 agrees with the measurements made by the phobos collaboration at @xmath59 @xcite . for the @xmath31 exponential function",

    "the inverse slopes of the spectra for positive and negative kaons measured at forward rapidity in our dataset are @xmath97 mev smaller than the ones measured at mid - rapidity in sps experiments at the same @xmath10 ratio . even though the values are consistent within error bars , the difference suggests that the transverse momenta are not governed by the baryo - chemical potential .",
    "the mid - rapidity particle densities for negative pions at sps at @xmath98 and 12.3  gev are approximately two times larger @xcite than the negative pion densities at the forward rapidities at @xmath9962.4  gev",

    "hence if @xmath101 is the same in the two cases , this would imply that the local system formed at high rapidity at rhic ( 62.4 gev ) is chemically equivalent with the system formed at the two highest sps energies at mid - rapidity , both being controlled by the baryo - chemical potential .",
    "the strangeness chemical potential is fixed by the baryo - chemical potential and chemical freeze - out temperature provided that the local net strangeness vanishes .",
    "a rapidity dependent baryo - chemical potential @xmath102 has been suggested in thermal models @xcite .",
    "the observed dependence of the chemical freeze - out composition in different colliding systems and different rapidities only on the baryo - chemical potential and temperature supports the idea of local chemical equilibration and the existence of a universal ( @xmath103 ) freeze - out line .",
    "in summary , we have measured the transverse momentum spectra and inclusive invariant yields of charged pions and kaons in central au+au reactions at 62.4 gev .",
    "the anti - particle / particle ratios for kaons and protons show a steep decrease at forward rapidity .",
    "the charge dependence of the @xmath23 ratio at forward rapidities is understood in the framework of microscopic models ( _ i.e. _ urqmd ) as resulting from the associated production in a baryon rich medium .",
    "the production mechanisms enhance the fraction of @xmath104 quarks ending up in hyperons , thus depleting the @xmath43 yield .",
    "we observe in central nucleus - nucleus collisions a common dependence of the particle ratios ( @xmath23 , @xmath9 ) and kaon spectra inverse slopes on @xmath10 , which reflects the baryo - chemical potential , whether measured for different energies at mid - rapidity at sps , or at different rapidities at @xmath4  gev .",
    "this is consistent with a picture where in nucleus - nucleus collisions , at a given energy , the local fireballs formed at different rapidities freeze out on a @xmath103 line which coincides with the @xmath103 freeze - out line previously observed in a wide energy range but only at mid - rapidity .",
    "the baryo - chemical potential interval covered at forward rapidity extends to high values and is equivalent to the two highest sps energies , but not quite high enough to probe the horn structure in the @xmath17 ratio excitation function . in the calculations made with urqmd and ampt models ,",
    "@xmath23 ratios are not well reproduced for large baryo - chemical potential found either at high rapidity or mid - rapidity at lower energies although urqmd seems to reproduce qualitatively the trend of the data .",
