    "<S> we follow the lead of dvqkd by employing decoy states @xcite to deal with this problem . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , alice operates her spdc source at several different pump powers enabling bob and her to estimate the fraction , @xmath64 , of their coincidences that originated from single - pair emissions @xcite .    to put an upper bound on eve s holevo information , we start from the following points : ( 1 ) symmetry dictates that only 10 tfcm elements need to be found . of these , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are immune to eve s attack because eve does not have access to alice s apparatus , which contains the spdc source . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath88 represents jitter - limited raw arrival - time measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that qkd is possible out to 200 km when alice and bob have receivers with 15% system efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> going to 90% system efficiency allows qkd out to 300 km and increases the secure - key rate by nearly two orders of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an important point to make about the secure - key rate curves associated with the two @xmath91 values we have employed . </S>",
    "<S> constraining eve to @xmath92 requires the use of a conjugate - franson interferometer , because jitter - limited raw arrival - time measurements can not measure finer than @xmath93 with our system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , @xmath93 still yields a positive secure - key rate . </S>",
    "<S> this is because eavesdropping in one basis disturbs correlation in the conjugate basis . in our protocol , alice and </S>",
    "<S> bob generate key from the time basis , so degradation in the timing correlation does not increase eve s holevo information , although it slightly reduces alice and bob s mutual information and hence their secure - key rate .    </S>",

    "<S> our protocol sacrifices potential secure - key rate when detector timing jitter , @xmath41 , exceeds the spdc source s correlation time , @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath81 can not approach its ultimate limit of @xmath96 bits / coincidence that is set by the source s schmidt number . </S>",
    "<S> that limit can be achieved with wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) that makes the two - photon correlation time in each wdm channel comparable to the detector timing jitter @xcite and deriving key from time - frequency coincidences . in this case , the conjugate - franson interferometer becomes crucial , because part of the secure key information is obtained by frequency measurements . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the tfcm is still sufficient to bound eve s holevo information .    before concluding , it behooves us to compare our security predictions with the individual - attack results reported in brougham _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison is not entirely straightforward , because those authors considered a time - binned version of time - energy entanglement hdqkd with no multiple - pair emissions or dark counts , whereas our protocol operates in continuous time and includes both of those effects . </S>",
    "<S> consider the 1024-bin example from @xcite , in which eve obtains 6bits out of 10 when the franson s fringe visibility is 99.2% and 5bits when that visibility is 99.8% . to compare our results with those , we set @xmath97 , so that alice and bob s mutual information equals 10bits / coincidence in the presence of @xmath41 timing jitter when there are neither dark counts nor multiple - pair emissions . under these conditions , our security analysis sets upper bounds of 6.07bits and 5.83bits on eve s holevo information for 99.2% and 99.8% fi visibility . _    in summary , we adapted the gaussian - state security analysis for cvqkd to our time - energy entanglement hdqkd protocol . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that a franson interferometer s fringe visibility suffices against arbitrary collective attacks when that measurement is used in conjunction with decoy states , which allow the fraction of single - pair spdc frames to be estimated . adding a conjugate - franson interferometer to the system enables tighter constraints on the tfcm , leading to a higher secure - key rate . </S>",
