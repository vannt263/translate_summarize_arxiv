    "one of the key ingredients of the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) @xcite is the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) @xcite , giving rise to goldstone - excitations which in turn can be related to gauge boson mass terms .",
    "this procedure , ussually called higgs mechanism @xcite , is necessary in order to describe the short ranged weak interactions by a gauge theory without spoiling gauge invariance .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge bosons at cern in 1983 may be considered as the first experimental evidence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon in electroweak interactions @xcite . in present and future experiments",
    "one hopes to get insight into the nature of this symmetry breaking sector ( @xmath4 ) and this is one of the main motivations for constructing the next generation of accelerators .",
    "in particular , it is the most exiciting challenge for the recently approved lhc collider being built at cern .    in the sm , the symmetry breaking",
    "is realized linearly by a scalar field which acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "the resulting physical spectrum contains not only the massive intermediate vector bosons and fermionic matter fields but also the higgs particle , a neutral scalar field which has successfully escaped experimental detection until now .",
    "the main advantage of the standard model picture of symmetry breaking lies in the fact that an explicit and consistent formulation exists , and any observable can be calculated perturbatively in the higgs self - coupling constant .",
    "however , the fact that one can compute in a model does nt mean at all that this is the right one .",
    "the concept of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is more general than the way it is usually implemented in the sm .",
    "any alternative @xmath4 has a chance to replace the standard higgs sector , provided it meets the following basic requirements : 1 ) electromagnetism remains unbroken ; 2 ) the full symmetry contains the electroweak gauge symmetry ; 3 ) the symmetry breaking occurs at about the energy scale @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the fermi coupling constant .    in these lectures",
    "i will review all these basic ingredients of the symmetry breaking phenomenom in the electroweak theory , and i will discuss some relevant topics related with this breaking .",
    "the lectures aim to be of pedagogical character and they are essentially addressed to young particle physicists without too much theoretical background in quantum field theory .",
    "the lectures include a survey of experimental higgs particle searches and the present status of theoretical bounds on the higgs mass .",
    "part of these lectures is devoted to present selected @xmath4 beyond the sm higgs sector .",
    "it includes short introductions to : the higgs sector of the minimal susy model ( mssm ) , technicolor models , strongly interacting scalar sectors and the electroweak chiral lagrangian ( echl ) .",
    "these lectures do not pretend to treat exhaustively the subject of electroweak symmetry breaking nor to provide a complete set of references .",
    "i appologize for possible ( most probably ) missing references .",
    "a simple definition of the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb)@xcite is as follows :    _ a physical system has a symmetry that is spontaneously broken if the interactions governing the dynamics of the system possess such a symmetry but the ground state of this system does not_.    an illustrative example of this phenomenon is the infinitely extended ferromagnet . for this purpouse ,",
    "let us consider the system near the curie temperature @xmath7 .",
    "it is described by an infinite set of elementary spins whose interactions are rotationally invariant , but its ground state presents two different situations depending on the value of the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "* situation i * : @xmath9    the spins of the system are randomly oriented and as a consequence the average magnetization vanishes : @xmath10 . the ground state with these disoriented spins is clearly rotationally invariant .    * situation ii * : @xmath11    the spins of the system are all oriented parallely to some particular but arbitrary direction and the average magnetization gets a non - zero value : @xmath12 ( _ spontaneous magnetization _ ) . since the direction of the spins is arbitrary there are infinite possible ground states , each one corresponding to one possible direction and all having the same ( minimal ) energy .",
    "futhermore , none of these states is rotationally invariant since there is a privileged direction .",
    "this is , therefore , a clear example of spontaneous symmetry breaking since the interactions among the spins are rotationally invariant but the ground state is not .",
    "more specifically , it is the fact that the system chooses one among the infinite possible non - invariant ground states what produces the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking .    on the theoretical side , and irrespectively of what could be the origen of such a physical phenomenon at a more fundamental level",
    ", one can parametrize this behaviour by means of a symple mathematical model . in the case of the infinitely extended ferromagnet",
    "one of these models is provided by the theory of ginzburg - landau @xcite .",
    "we present in the following the basic ingredients of this model .    for @xmath8 near @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath13 is small and the free energy density @xmath14 can be approached by ( here higher powers of @xmath13 are neglected ) : @xmath15 the magnetization of the ground state is obtained from the condition of extremum : @xmath16=0 \\label{min}\\ ] ] there are two solutions for @xmath13 , depending on the value of @xmath8 :    * solution i * :    if @xmath17>0\\;\\rightarrow \\vec{m } = 0 $ ] + the solution for @xmath13 is the trivial one and corresponds to the situation i described before where the ground state is rotational invariant .",
    "the potential @xmath18 has a symmetric shape with a unique minimum at the origen @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "this is represented in fig.1 for the simplified bidimensional case , @xmath21 .",
    "+    * fig.1 * the potential @xmath18 in the symmetric phase    :    if @xmath22 is a local maximum and eq.([min ] ) requires : @xmath23 above , but different direction of @xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds to the situation ii where the system has infinite possible degenerate ground states which are not rotationally invariant .",
    "the potential @xmath18 has a mexican hat shape as represented in fig.2 for the bidimensional case .",
    "@xmath24    * fig.2 * the potential @xmath18 in the spontaneously broken phase    notice that it is the choice of the particular ground state what produces , for @xmath11 , the spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry .",
    "in the language of quantum field theory , _ a system is said to possess a symmetry that is spontaneously broken if the lagrangian describing the dynamics of the system is invariant under these symmetry transformations , but the vacuum of the theory is not_. here the vacuum @xmath25 is the state where the hamiltonian expectation value @xmath26 is minimum .    for illustrative purposes we present in the following the particular case of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) where there is a symmetry , the chiral symmetry , that is spontaneously broken @xcite . for simplicity let us consider qcd with just two flavours .",
    "the lagrangian is given by : @xmath27 where , @xmath28\\nonumber \\\\    d_{\\mu}q & = & ( \\partial_{\\mu}-ig_s a_{\\mu})q \\nonumber \\\\",
    "a_{\\mu}&=&\\sum_{a=1}^8 \\frac{1}{2}a_{\\mu}^a\\lambda_a\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to check that for @xmath29 , @xmath30 has ( apart from the @xmath31 gauge symmetry ) a global symmetry @xmath32 , called chiral symmetry , that is defined by the following transformations : @xmath33 @xmath34 where , @xmath35 @xmath36    @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be written in terms of the 2x2 matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) corresponding to the generators @xmath42 and @xmath43 of @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively : @xmath46    it turns out that the physical vacuum of qcd is not invariant under the full chiral @xmath32 group but just under the subgroup @xmath47 that is the well known isospin symmetry group .",
    "the transformations given by the axial subgroup , @xmath48 , do not leave the qcd vacuum invariant . therefore , qcd with @xmath29 has a chiral symmetry which is spontaneously broken down to the isospin symmetry : @xmath49    the fact that in nature @xmath50 introduces an extra explicit breaking of this chiral symmetry . since the fermion masses are small this explicit breaking is soft .",
    "the chiral symmetry is not an exact but approximate symmetry of qcd .",
    "one important question is still to be clarified .",
    "how do we know from experiment that , in fact , the qcd vacuum is not @xmath32 symmetric ? .",
    "let us assume for the moment that it is chiral invariant .",
    "we will see that this assumption leads to a contradiction with experiment .    if @xmath25 is chiral invariant @xmath51 @xmath52    in addition , if @xmath53 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian and parity operator such that : @xmath54 then , @xmath55 in summary , if the qcd vacuum is chiral invariant there must exist pairs of degenerate states in the spectrum , the so - called parity doublets as @xmath53 and @xmath56 , which are related by a chiral transformation and have opposite parities .",
    "the absence of such parity doublets in the hadronic spectrum indicates that the chiral symmetry must be spontaneously broken .",
    "namely , there must exist some generators @xmath57 of the chiral group such that @xmath58 .",
    "more specifically , it can be shown that these generators are the three @xmath59 of the axial group , @xmath48 . in conclusion ,",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking pattern in qcd is @xmath60 as announced .",
    "one of the physical implications of the spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenom is the appearance of massless modes .",
    "for instance , in the case of the infinitely extended ferromagnet and below the curie temperature there appear modes connecting the different possible ground states , the so - called spin waves .",
    "the general situation in quantum fied theory is described by the goldstone theorem @xcite :    _ if a theory has a global symmetry of the lagrangian which is not a symmetry of the vacuum then there must exist one massless boson , scalar or pseudoscalar , associated to each generator which does not annihilate the vacuum and having its same quantum numbers .",
    "these modes are referred to as nambu - goldstone bosons or simply as goldstone bosons .",
    "_    let us return to the example of qcd .",
    "the breaking of the chiral symmetry is characterized by @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , according to goldstone theorem , there must exist three massless goldstone bosons , @xmath62 , which are pseudoscalars .",
    "these bosons are identified with the three physical pions .",
    "the fact that pions have @xmath63 is a consequence of the soft explicit breaking in @xmath30 given by @xmath64 .",
    "the fact that @xmath65 is small and that there is a large gap between this mass and the rest of the hadron masses can be seen as another manifestation of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with the pions being the pseudo - goldstone bosons of this breaking .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen the equivalence between the condition @xmath66 and the non - invariance of the vacuum under the symmetry transformations generated by the @xmath57 generators : @xmath67    in quantum field theory , it can be shown that an alternative way of characterizing the phenomenom of ssb is by certain field operators that have non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ( v.e.v . ) .",
    "@xmath68    this non - vanishing v.e.v . plays the role of the order parameter signaling the existence of a phase where the symmetry of the vacuum is broken .",
    "there are several possibilities for the nature of this field operator .",
    "in particular , when it is a composite operator which represents a composite state being produced from a strong underlying dynamics , the corresponding ssb is said to be a dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking in qcd is one example of this type of breaking .",
    "the non - vanishing chiral condensate made up of a quark and an anti - quark is the order paremeter in this case : @xmath69 the strong interactions of @xmath31 are the responsible for creating these @xmath70 pairs from the vacuum and , therefore , the value of the condensate @xmath71 should , in principle , be calculable from qcd .",
    "it is interesting to mention that this type of symmetry breaking can happen similarly in more general @xmath72 gauge theories .",
    "the corresponding gauge couplings become sufficiently strong at large distances and allow for spontaneous breaking of their additional chiral - like symmetries .",
    "the corresponding order paremeter is also a chiral condensate : @xmath73 .",
    "the goldstone theorem is for theories with spontaneously broken global symmetries but does not hold for gauge theories .",
    "when a spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place in a gauge theory the so - called higgs mechanism operates @xcite :    _ the would - be goldstone bosons associated to the global symmetry breaking do not manifest explicitely in the physical spectrum but instead they combine with the massless gauge bosons and as result , once the spectrum of the theory is built up on the asymmetrical vacuum , there appear massive vector particles .",
    "the number of vector bosons that acquire a mass is precisely equal to the number of these would - be - goldstone bosons_.    there are three important properties of the higgs mechanism for mass generation that are worth mentioning :    * it respects the gauge symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "* it preserves the total number of polarization degrees .",
    "* it does not spoil the good high energy properties nor the renormalizability of the massless gauge theories @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the case of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions @xcite .",
    "we will see in the following how the higgs mechanism is implemented in the @xmath74 gauge theory in order to generate a mass for the weak gauge bosons , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the following facts must be considered :    * the lagrangian of the sm is gauge @xmath74 symmetric .",
    "therefore , anything we wish to add must preserve this symmetry . *",
    "we wish to generate masses for the three gauge bosons @xmath2 and @xmath3 but not for the photon , @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , we need three would - be - goldstone bosons , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which will combine with the three massless gauge bosons of the @xmath74 symmetry . * since @xmath79 is a symmetry of the physical spectrum , it must be a symmetry of the vacuum of the electroweak theory .    from the above considerations we conclude that in order to implement the higgs mechanism in the electroweak theory we need to introduce ad hoc an additional system that interacts with the gauge sector in a @xmath74 gauge invariant manner and whose self - interactions , being also introduced ad hoc , must produce the wanted breaking , @xmath80 , with the three associated would - be - goldstone bosons @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this sytem is the so - called symmetry breaking sector ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "in this section we introduce and justify the simplest choice for the @xmath4 of the electroweak theory .",
    "let @xmath81 be the additional system providing the @xmath82 breaking .",
    "@xmath81 must fulfil the following conditions :    * it must be a scalar field so that the above breaking preserves lorentz invariance .",
    "* it must be a complex field so that the hamiltonian is hermitian .",
    "* it must have non - vanishing weak isospin and hypercharge in order to break @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the assignment of quantum numbers and the choice of representation of @xmath81 can be done in many ways .",
    "some possibilities are : - choice of a non - linear representation : @xmath81 transforms non - linearly under @xmath74 .",
    "- choice of a linear representation : @xmath81 transforms linearly under @xmath74 .",
    "the simplest linear representation is a complex doublet .",
    "alternative choices are : complex triplets , more than one doublet , etc .",
    "in particular , one may choose two complex doublets @xmath85 and @xmath86 as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model . * only the neutral components of @xmath81 are allowed to acquire a non - vanishing v.e.v . in order to preserve the @xmath79 symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "* the interactions of @xmath81 with the gauge and fermionic sectors must be introduced in a gauge invariant way . *",
    "the self - interactions of @xmath81 given by the potential @xmath87 must produce the wanted breaking which is characterized in this case by @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath81 can be , in principle , a fundamental or a composite field . *",
    "if we want to be predictive from low energies to very high energies the interactions in @xmath87 must be renormalizable . if instead one renounces to the predictivity at such high energies there is an alternative possibility : the sm could be considered as an effective theory of some other fundamental theory which opeartes at much higher energies . in that case",
    "the emerging effective potential @xmath89 could be non - renormalizable and its predictivity must be restricted just to low energies .    by taking into account the above seven points one is led to the following simplest choice for the system @xmath81 and the lagrangian of the @xmath4 of the electroweak theory : @xmath90 where , @xmath91 d_\\mu \\phi &   = &   ( \\partial_\\mu - \\frac{1}{2 } i g \\vec{\\tau}\\cdot\\vec{w}_\\mu -\\frac{1}{2 } i g ' b_\\mu ) \\phi . \\label{sms}\\end{aligned}\\",
    "] ] here @xmath81 is a fundamental complex doublet with hypercharge @xmath92 and @xmath87 is the simplest renormalizable potential . @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the gauge fields of @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the corresponding gauge couplings .",
    "it is interesting to notice the similarities with the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "depending on the sign of the mass parameter ( @xmath97 ) , there are two possibilities for the v.e.v . @xmath98 that minimizes the potential @xmath87 ,    * @xmath99 : the minimum is at : @xmath100 the vacuum is @xmath74 symmetric and therefore no symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "* @xmath101 : the minimum is at : @xmath102 + therefore , there are infinite degenerate vacua corresponding to infinite posssible values of @xmath103 .",
    "either of these vacua is @xmath74 non - symmetric and @xmath79 symmetric .",
    "the breaking @xmath104 occurs once a particular vacuum is chosen . as usual ,",
    "the simplest choice is taken : @xmath105    the two above symmetric and non - symmetric phases of the electroweak theory are clearly similar to the two phases of the ferromagnet that we have described within the ginzburg landau theory context . in the sm , the field @xmath81 replaces the magnetization @xmath13 and the potential @xmath87 replaces @xmath18 .",
    "the sm order papameter is , consequently , @xmath98 . in the symmetric phase @xmath87",
    "is as in fig.1 , whereas in the non - symmetric phase it is as in fig.2 .",
    "another interesting aspect of the higgs mechanism , as we have already mentioned , is that it preserves the total number of polarization degrees .",
    "let us make the counting in detail :    * * before ssb * + 4 massless gauge bosons : @xmath106 + 4 massless scalars : the 4 real components of @xmath81 , @xmath107 + total number of polarization degrees @xmath108 * * after ssb * + 3 massive gauge bosons : @xmath109 + 1 massless gauge boson : @xmath75 + 1 massive scalar : @xmath110 + total number of polarization degrees : @xmath111    furthermore , it is important to realize that one more degree than needed is introduced into the theory from the beginning .",
    "three of the real components of @xmath81 , or similarly @xmath112 and @xmath113 , are the needed would - be goldstone bosons and the fourth one @xmath114 is introduced just to complete the complex doublet .",
    "after the symmetry breaking , this extra degree translates into the apparition in the spectrum of an extra massive scalar particle , the higgs boson particle @xmath110 .    before ending this section , we would like to address the following important question : is it possible the higgs mechanism without the higgs particle ? .",
    "from the previous counting we see that , strictly speaking , it is not needed to implement the symmetry breaking .",
    "the higgs mechanism does require just the three would - be goldstone bosons in order to generate the masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge bosons .",
    "two more questions then arise . how must be introduced these three scalars ? and , what are the consequences of eliminating the higgs particle ? .",
    "it turns out that the only possiblity of introducing the minimal number of scalars , that is three , is by means of a non - linear representation .",
    "one example is : @xmath115 @xmath116 is a @xmath117 unitary matrix and transforms linearly under @xmath74 : @xmath118 however , the would - be goldstone boson fields transform non - linearly : @xmath119 with @xmath120 a non - linear function .    moreover , one may build a potential in terms of the field @xmath116 and its derivatives , @xmath121 , such that it produces the wanted breaking @xmath0 .",
    "it can be shown that the model in which one replaces the standard @xmath87 by this @xmath121 fulfils the requirements 1 to 6 presented before .",
    "of course , the derivatives in the later should be replaced by the corresponding covariant derivatives in order to get gauge invariance of the full lagrangian .",
    "the drawback of this model is that it fails in condition 7 .",
    "in contrast to the standard @xmath87 , @xmath121 is non - renormalizable and therefore it can not be predictive to very high energies . in conclusion , if we want to implement the higgs mechanism without the higgs particle we must renounce to the renormalizability of the @xmath4 and we need to build a sensible low energy effective theory and define a way to deal with non - renormalizable interactions .",
    "in order to get the particle spectra and the particle masses we first write down the full sm lagrangian which is @xmath74 gauge invariant : @xmath122 here , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the lagrangians of the yang mills fields , the fermionic fields , the @xmath4 and the yukawa interactions respectively : @xmath127 \\cl_{\\psi}&=&\\sum_{\\psi}i \\overline{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}d_{\\mu}\\psi \\\\[2 mm ] \\cl_{\\rm sbs } & = & ( d_\\mu \\phi)^\\dagger ( d^\\mu \\phi ) + \\mu^2\\phi^\\dagger \\phi - \\lambda ( \\phi^\\dagger \\phi)^2 \\\\[2 mm ] \\cl_{\\rm yw}&= & \\lambda_e\\bar{l}_l\\phi e_r+ \\lambda_u\\bar{q}\\widetilde{\\phi}u_r+\\lambda_d\\bar{q}_l\\phi d_r+h.c.+ 2^{nd}\\ ; { \\rm and}\\ ; 3^{rd}\\;{\\rm families}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the gauge fixing and faddeev - popov terms respectively that we omit here for brevity .",

    "let us assume some concrete renormalization of the sm parameters .",

    "this phenomenom can be better explained in terms of the effective potential with quantum corrections included on it .",

    "the condition of extremum is : @xmath304 which leads to two possible solutions : a ) the trivial vacuum with @xmath305 ; and b ) the non - trivial vacuum with @xmath306 . if we want the true vacuum to be the non - trivial one we must have : @xmath307 however , the value of the potential at the minimum depends on the size of its second derivative : @xmath308 and , it turns out that for too low values of @xmath208 the condition above , eq.([stab ] ) , turns over .",
    "that is , @xmath309 and the true vacuum changes to the trivial one .",
    "the condition for vacuum stability then implies a lower bound on @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , @xmath310 surprisingly , for @xmath311 this bound dissapears and , moreover , @xmath312 becomes unbounded from below!. apparently it seems a disaster since the top mass is known at present and is certainly larger than this value .",
    "the solution to this problem relies in the fact that for such input values , the 1-loop approach becomes unrealistic and a 2-loop analysis of the effective potential is needed .",
    "recent studies indicate that by requiring vacuum stability at 2-loop level and up to very large energies of the order of @xmath299 , the following lower bound is found @xcite : @xmath313 this is for @xmath314 and @xmath315 and there is an uncertainty in this bound of @xmath316 to @xmath317 @xmath318 from the uncertainty in the @xmath201 and @xmath319 values .",

    ", @xmath326 must be predictable from this underlying theory",

    "for instance , for @xmath329 and if we require @xmath330 , @xmath321 must be fine - tuned up to 30 decimals!. this extreme fine - tuning is what is considered unnatural .",
    "there are two most popular proposed solutions to the naturalness problem , one is based on supersymmetry and the other one on technicolor .    * i.- supersymmetry *    the sm is assumed to be the low energy effective theory of some fundamental theory which is supersymmetric and operates at very high energy , say @xmath331 .    the new symmetry between bosons and fermions , the supersymmetry ( susy )",
    ", @xcite implies an extension of the sm spectrum . in particular",
    ", for each scalar boson particle with mass @xmath332 there must exist a fermionic superpartner with its same mass , @xmath333 .",

    "let @xmath85 and @xmath86 be these two doublets : @xmath377 because of the supersymmetry , in addition to these scalars , there are two associated fermionic superpartners with their same quantum numbers : @xmath378 the reason to introduce two scalar doublets instead of one as in the sm is two fold : 1 ) only by including the fermionic doublets in pairs it is possible to cancel their contribution to the gauge anomaly ; 2 ) a second scalar doublet @xmath85 with @xmath379 is needed to generate the masses of the @xmath380 type quarks .",
    "the complex conjugate @xmath381 can not play this role , as in the sm does , since the requirement of susy implies the superpotential must be an analytic function and therefore it does not allow for complex conjugate scalar fields .",
    "the counting of polarization degrees in the electroweak symmetry breaking within the mssm is different than in the sm .",
    "it goes as follows ,    * * before ssb * + 4 massless gauge bosons : @xmath106 + 8 massless scalars : the 4 + 4 real components of the complex doublets @xmath85 and @xmath86 + total number of polarization degrees @xmath382 * * after ssb * + 3 massive gauge bosons : @xmath109 + 1 massless gauge boson : @xmath75 + 5 massive scalar bosons : @xmath383 + total number of polarization degrees : @xmath384    as in the sm , the total number of polarization degrees is preserved in the breaking but now it is larger than in sm . apart from the three needed would - be - goldstone bosons , there have been introduced ad hoc five more polarization degrees ( instead of one as in the sm ) which , after the breaking , emerge as the five physical massive higgs bosons of the mssm :    * two charged scalar bosons , @xmath385 and @xmath386 * one cp - odd neutral scalar boson , @xmath387 * two cp - even neutral scalar bosons , @xmath388 and @xmath389    the simplest potential i m terms of @xmath85 and @xmath86 that is supersymmetric is given by : @xmath390 this should be compared with the higgs potential of the sm : @xmath391 the following observations are in order :    * in the susy potential there is the same coefficient for the @xmath392 and @xmath392 terms .",
    "this will lead to some mass relations .",
    "* in the susy potential the scalar self - coupling is not an independent papameter but it is given in terms of the gauge coupling constants @xmath209 and @xmath393 .",
    "therefore , the higgs sector in the mssm is allways weakly interacting and contains , at least , one light higgs boson with @xmath394 .",
    "* the susy potential can not produce the wanted electroweak symmetry breaking since it is definite possitive , @xmath395 , and its minimum is at the trivial vacuum , @xmath396 . in order to generate a non - trivial asymmetric vacuum",
    "some additional terms are needed in the potential .",
    "these are the above mentioned soft - breaking terms whose role is two fold : to break the supersymmetry and to break @xmath74 .",
    "the simplest potential with soft breaking terms included is given by , @xmath397 where , @xmath398 and @xmath399 , @xmath400 and @xmath401 are the soft susy breaking parameters",
    ".    one can check that the following are the necessary conditions for @xmath74 breaking :    * @xmath402 + this condition insures the existence of infinite degenerate vacua with @xmath403 and @xmath404 .",
    "* @xmath405 + this condition is needed to insure vacuum stability .",
    "once these conditions are imposed , the next step is to choose one out of the infinite degenerate vacua .",
    "the usual asymmetric vacuum is the simplest one which is defined by the following configuration :    @xmath406 + @xmath407 and @xmath408 are real and possitive + @xmath401 is real and possitive    furthermore , @xmath407 and @xmath408 are not completely free . they must fulfil the following additional constraint :",
    "@xmath409 one can use @xmath410 , @xmath411 and @xmath401 as input parameters to characterize the breaking or some three alternative parameters .",
    "for instance , @xmath407 , @xmath408 and the mass of the cp - odd scalar boson @xmath412 .",
    "if we consider , in addition , the constraint of eq.([const ] ) we are left with just two independent papameters .",
    "it is customary to choose as input parameters : @xmath412 and @xmath413 .",
    "after some algebra one finds out the higgs masses in terms of these parameters : @xmath414 \\label{masses}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as well as the higgs spectrum : @xmath415 where , @xmath416 the result in eq.([masses ] ) indicates that the following inequalities hold in the mssm at tree level , @xmath417 interestingly , there is a neutral higgs boson @xmath418 lighter than the @xmath3 boson .",
    "this fact , when it was noticed , seemed to announce a possible discovery of @xmath418 at lep .",
    "however , it was realized later that , beyond tree level , these inequalities in eq.([ineq ] ) do not hold anylonger .",
    "in particular , @xmath419 gets large corrections from top and stop loops and one finds out to one loop that @xmath420 . by scanning the whole parameter space ,",
    "recent studies indicate , however , that the values obtained for @xmath421 , including the complete one - loop corrections , never exceed certain value . in ref.@xcite",
    "the following absolute upper limit is found : @xmath422 on the other hand , since these scalar particles have not been seen at present experiments one can extract experimental lower mass limits . from the absence of any higgs signal at the lep experiment one",
    "finds @xcite , @xmath423",
    "the strongly interacting hipothesis in the sm refers to the possibility that the scalar self - coupling @xmath147 be large and a perturbative approach in powers of this coupling is not anylonger valid . since in the sm at tree level",
    "there is a direct relation between @xmath147 and @xmath159 given by @xmath424 , a large value of @xmath147 implies a large value of @xmath159 .",
    "thus , for instance , for a very heavy higgs with @xmath425 one gets a non perturbative coupling of @xmath426 .    given the sm potential of eq.([lsbs ] ) , a large value of @xmath147 implies that the interactions among the three would - be - goldstone bosons and the higgs particle are strong . since , by virtue of the equivalence theorem of eq.([et ] )",
    ", there is a relation between the goldstone bosons and the longitudinal gauge bosons scattering amplitudes , @xmath427 it in turn implies that , at high enough energies , the @xmath428 and @xmath350 gauge bosons become strongly interacting too @xcite . the amplitudes of longitudinal gauge bosons",
    "are expected to show the typical features of a strong interaction as , for instance , the appearance of multiple resonances with sizeable widths in the tev energy region etc . @xcite . in the case of the sm",
    ", the first resonance would be the higgs particle itself with a large mass and a large width @xcite .",
    "a common feature to all models of strongly interacting @xmath4 is that the size of the cross - section for production of longitudinal gauge bosons pairs at these high energies , @xmath429 , is expected to be larger than in weakly interacting theories as , for instance , the sm with a light higgs boson .",
    "although , there are several interesting possibilities to look for strongly interacting signals , the most obvious and , therefore , the most studied one is precisely @xmath430 production at the future collider lhc in the various possible channels , @xmath431 @xcite . in the large energy region",
    "it comes mainly from the so - called gauge boson fusion processes ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "several studies indicate that an enhacement in @xmath430 production over the expected background could be observed at lhc in the mass invariant region of @xmath432 @xcite .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "there are some intrinsic problems connected to the above definition of strongly interacting @xmath4 .",
    "one is that for a too heavy higgs particle , the width is comparable with the mass and an interpretation of @xmath110 as a particle or as a resonance makes no sense .",
    "another one is that for such a heavy boson , the elastic unitarity condition is violated in @xmath430 scattering , what indicates the failure of perturbation theory . in practice ,",
    "some unitarization procedure must , therefore , be implemented to cure this bad behaviour . in a more ambitious program , a non - perturbative treatment of this strongly interacting system",
    "should be performed .",
    "the lattice , would be obviously one possibility for future estimates .",
    "finally it is worth mentioning that one can also postulate the hipothesis of a strongly interacting @xmath4 beyond the sm .",
    "there are several proposals and all have as a common assumption that either the higgs particle does not exist or it is not a fundamental particle .",
    "some examples are : technicolor models @xcite , models where the higgs boson is a top - antitop condensate @xcite , the bess model @xcite etc ..",
    "these theorems are a consequence of the additional global symmetry , @xmath433 which is present in the @xmath4 of the sm and we wish to be present as well in any alternative higgs sector in view of the successfull prediction of @xmath434 based on this symmetry pattern .",
    "the low energy theorems are universal since they rely just on symmetry arguments and , therefore , they must hold in any possible scenario for the @xmath4 .",
    "they state the following :    _ the goldstone boson scattering amplitudes that are imposed by the symmetry of eq._([chiral ] ) _ are given at low energies by the following simple expressions _",
    "@xcite : @xmath435 where , @xmath436 , ( @xmath437 ) are the mandelstan variables and low energies here refer to energies well below any possible emerging resonance .",
    "it is interesting to notice the similarities with the low energy theorems for @xmath438 scattering which are associated with the chiral symmetry of qcd @xcite : @xmath439 where , @xmath440 and low energies here means @xmath441 .",
    "finally , by using the equivalence theorem , the above expressions in eq.([let ] ) are translated into low energy theorems for the scattering of longitudinal gauge bosons : @xmath442 they are universal as well and hold for any particular @xmath4 .",
    "the energy must be in the range of applicability of both the equivalence theorem and the low energy theorems .",
    "it means an energy larger than the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses but lower that the first possible resonance . in the particular case of the sm",
    ", the above expressions should hold in the energy range @xmath443 .",
    "this is indeed what results from the exact tree level expressions of eq.([long ] ) when this energy limit is considered .",
    "the electroweak interactions can be described at low energies by means of an effective lagrangian which is @xmath74 gauge invariant and is written in terms of just the light fields @xcite . in particular , the effective lagrangian which does not contain explicitely the higgs field in its formulation has been named electroweak chiral lagrangian and has some interesting applications to electroweak phenomenology @xcite . in this approach the higgs particle is assumed either very heavy , say @xmath444 , or unexistent .    in the bosonic sector ,",
    "the echl is a non - linear theory which is built in terms of a field @xmath116 that parametrizes the three would - be - godstone bosons , its covariant derivative @xmath445 and the @xmath74 gauge boson fields @xcite : @xmath446 where , @xmath447 and @xmath448 are defined in eq.([fields ] ) .",
    "it is a non - linear theory since the would - be - goldstone bosons transforms non - linearly under @xmath74 and it is a consequence of the lack of the higgs field in this theory that could complete together with the @xmath449 a linear multiplet .",
    "the @xmath116 field , however , transforms linearly under @xmath74 : @xmath450 the echl has the following generic form : @xmath451 where , @xmath452 + \\cl_{\\rm ym } \\label{nll}\\ ] ] is the lagrangian of the well known gauged non - linear sigma model and @xmath123 is the yang - mills lagrangian containing the kinetic , the gauge fixing and the faddeev popov terms .",
    "the @xmath453 s in eq.([ecl ] ) are the so - called chiral effective operators .",

    "furthermore , one can check that the scalar sector of echl has the additional global symmetry @xmath32 and it is spontaneously broken down to the custodial symmetry group @xmath181 .",
    "this is precisely the origen of including the name chiral in the echl .",
    "this approach to electroweak theory is inspired in the well known chiral lagrangian approach to qcd at low energies and the chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , the predictions in this theory for the would - be - goldstone boson scattering amplitudes ( in the approximation of neglecting the gauge interactions versus the scalar self - interactions ) are similar to the pion scattering amplitudes of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by virtue of the equivalence theorem @xcite it implies predictions for the scattering amplitudes of the longitudinal gauge bosons .",
    "finally , the coefficients @xmath463 in front of the effective operators are called the chiral parameters , and are very important since they encode the information on the particular underlying physics which is the responsible of generating this effective lagrangian to low energies . @xmath461 and the effective operators are universal whereas the values of the chiral parameters do depend on the underlying assumed fundamental theory .",
    "therefore it is crucial to meassure in experiment the @xmath463 values in order to be able to discriminate among the different possible scenarios . on the other hand , it is also important to compute these coefficients from the various posssible theories .",
