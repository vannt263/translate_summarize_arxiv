    "plasmas with massive charged dust grains are of interest both for space ( e.g. , cometary tails , planetary rings , the interstellar medium , earth s magnetosphere and upper atmosphere , earth s d and lower e regions etc . ) @xcite as well as laboratory plasmas @xcite . furthermore , dusty plasmas containing both positive and negative ions and a very few percentage of free electrons ( or almost electron - free ) are found in both naturally occurring plasmas ( e.g. , earth s d and lower e regions , the f - ring of saturn , nighttime polar mesosphere etc . ) @xcite and in plasmas used for technological applications @xcite .",
    "there are several motivations for investigating such plasmas and associated waves and instabilities owing to their potential applications in both laboratory and space plasma environments ( see , e.g. , refs . ) . in dusty plasmas ,",
    "the size of the dust grains may vary in the range of @xmath3 m , their mass is about @xmath4 times the mass of ions and they have atomic numbers @xmath5 in the range of @xmath6 @xcite . in typical dusty plasmas with electrons and ions , dust grains",
    "are negatively charged due to high mobility of electrons into dust grain surface @xcite .",
    "however , recent laboratory experiments @xcite suggest that in dusty negative - ion plasmas where positive ions are the more mobile species , dusts can be positively charged when @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are satisfied , where @xmath10 is the mass , @xmath11 is the number density and @xmath12 is the thermodynamic temperature of @xmath13-species particles in which @xmath14 stand for electrons , positive ions and negative ions respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "when charged dust grains collect all the electrons from the background plasma , they can be negatively charged .",
    "such density depletion of electrons associated with the capture of electrons by aerosol particles have been observed in the summer polar mesosphere at about 85 km altitude @xcite .",
    "furthermore , positively charged nanometer - seized particles were observed in the nighttime polar mesosphere in a region ( altitude range between 80 and 90 km ) dominated by positive and negative ions and a very few percentage of electrons @xcite .    it has been found that the presence of charged dust grains modifies the plasma wave phenomena and these charged dust grains give rise to new low - frequency eigenmodes , called dust - acoustic wave ( daw ) ,",
    "which was first theoretically predicted by rao _",
    "_ @xcite . however , the presence of negative ions in dusty plasmas can significantly modify not only the dispersion properties of daws but also some nonlinear localized structures ( for some recent theoretical developments and experiments in negative ion plasmas readers are referred to refs . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "these waves can be damped ( collisionless ) due to the resonance of particles ( trapped and/or free ) with the wave ( i.e. , when the particle s velocity is nearly equal to the wave phase velocity ) @xcite .",
    "the linear electron landau damping of nonlinear ion - acoustic solitary waves was first studied by ott and sudan @xcite neglecting the particle s trapping effects on the assumption that the particle trapping time is much longer than that of landau damping .",
    "they derived a korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation with a source term that models the lowest - order effects of resonant particles .",
    "it was demonstrated that an initial wave form may either steepen or not depending on the relative size of the nonlinearity compared to the landau damping .",
    "the latter was also shown to cause decay of wave amplitude with time .    in the past",
    ", several authors have attempted to study the effects of landau damping on the nonlinear propagation of electrostatic solitary waves in different plasma systems .",
    "for example , bandyopadhyay _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the propagation characteristics of ion - acoustic solitary waves with landau damping in nonthermal plasmas .",
    "@xcite considered the linear landau damping effects on nonlinear ion - acoustic solitary waves in electron - positron - ion plasmas .",
    "they studied the properties of the wave phase velocity , the solitary wave amplitude as well as the landau damping rate with the important effects of positron density and temperature .",
    "motivated by the recent theoretical developments as well as experimental observations of low - frequency electrostatic waves in pair - ion plasmas @xcite we have investigated the landau damping effects of dust - acoustic ( da ) solitary waves in dusty pair - ion plasmas ( quite distinctive from electron - positron - ion plasmas and dusty electron - ion plasmas ) .",
    "we show that for typical plasma parameters relevant for laboratory and space environments , the landau damping ( and the nonlinear ) effect is stronger than the finite debye length ( dispersive ) effects for which the kdv soliton theory is not applicable to daws in dusty pair - ion plasmas .",
    "the landau damping effect is shown to slow down the wave amplitude with time .",
    "it is found that in contrast to electron - ion or electron - positron - ion plasmas , the nonlinearity in the kdv equation can never vanish in dusty pair - ion plasmas with positively or negatively charged dusts .",
    "this implies that the modified kdv equation is no longer required for the evolution of daws .",
    "the properties of the linear phase velocity , solitary wave amplitudes ( in presence and absence of the landau damping ) as well as the landau damping rate are also analyzed with the effects of positive ion to dust density ratio @xmath0 as well as the ratios of positive to negative ion temperatures @xmath1 and masses @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of electrostatic daws in an unmagnetized collisionless dusty plasma consisting of singly charged adiabatic positive and negative ions , and positively or negatively charged mobile dusts .",
    "the latter are assumed to have equal mass and charge which are treated as constant .",
    "it is to be noted that the dust charge fluctuation process may introduce a new low - frequency wave eigen mode as well as another dissipative effect ( wave damping ) into the system .",
    "however , we have neglected this charge fluctuation effect on the propagation of dust - acoustic waves by the assumption that the charging rate of dust grains is very high compared to the dust plasma oscillation frequency .",
    "the collisions of all particles are also neglected in the considered interval of time .",
    "furthermore , in dusty plasmas the ratio of electric charge to mass of dust grains remains much smaller than those of both positive and negative ions .",
    "it is also assumed that the size of the grains is small compared to the average distance between them .",
    "the unperturbed state is overall neutral so that the internal electric field is zero .",
    "also , the curl of the electric field vanishes ( i.e. , electrostatic ) , and the perturbation about the equilibrium state is weak . at equilibrium , the overall charge neutrality condition reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the unperturbed number density of species @xmath13 ( @xmath13=@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 respectively stand for positive ions , negative ions , and dynamical charged dusts ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath20 ) is the unperturbed dust charge state and @xmath21 according to when dusts are positively or negatively charged .    the cold dust is described by a set of fluid equations - , whereas the two species of ions ( positive and negative ) are described by the kinetic vlasov equation .",
    "the electric potential @xmath22 is described by the poisson equation .",
    "thus , the basic equations for the dynamics of charged particles in one space dimension are @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath13 stands for @xmath17 , @xmath18 denoting , respectively , the positive and negative ions .",
    "the ion densities are given by @xmath27 in equations - @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , respectively , denote the number density , fluid velocity , charge and mass of dust grains . also , @xmath32 is the particle s velocity , and @xmath33 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , denote the velocity distribution function , mass and number densities of @xmath13-species ions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 is the electrostatic potential and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the space and time coordinates .",
    "equations - can be recast in terms of dimensionless variables .",
    "we normalize the physical quantities according to @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the da speed with @xmath43 and @xmath44 denoting , respectively , the dust plasma frequency and the plasma debye length . here",
    ", @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 is the thermodynamic temperature and @xmath46 is the thermal velocity of @xmath13-species ions .",
    "the space and time variables are normalized by @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , where @xmath47 is the characteristic scale length for variations of @xmath49 etc .",
    "thus , from equations - , we obtain the following set of equations in dimensionless form : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 together with the charge neutrality condition given by @xmath55 in eq .",
    ", @xmath56 for positive @xmath57 and negative @xmath58 ions and @xmath59 .",
    "also , in eq .",
    ", @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath18 .",
    "the basic parameters can be defined as follows :    *   @xmath62 ( for positive ions ) and @xmath63 ( for negative ions with @xmath64 ) , which represent the effects due to ion inertias , and , in particular , landau damping by both the positive and negative ions .",
    "* @xmath65 , the ratio of perturbed density to its equilibrium value .",
    "this measures the strength of the nonlinearity in electrostatic disturbances .",
    "* @xmath66 : this is a measure of the strength of the wave dispersion due to deviation from the quasineutrality .",
    "here , @xmath47 represents the characteristic scale length for variations of the physical quantities , namely , @xmath67 etc .",
    "this parameter disappears in the left - side of eq .",
    ", if one considers the normalization of @xmath34 by @xmath68 instead of @xmath47 .    note that if the ions are intertialess compared to the massive charged dusts , the ratios @xmath69 and @xmath63 can be neglected in eq . , and one can replace ( hence disregarding the landau damping effects ) this equation by the boltzmann distributions of ions . on the other hand , when",
    "dust grains are considered cold , i.e. , @xmath70 , then the landau damping is provided solely by the ions and the damping rate is @xmath71 @xmath69 or @xmath63 . since one of our main interests is to study the interplay among the nonlinearity , the dispersion and the landau damping effects , we consider @xcite    * @xmath72 , * @xmath73 , * @xmath74 ,    where @xmath75 is a smallness parameter and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) is a constant assumed to be of the order - unity .",
    "then from eq .",
    "we obtain the following two equations for positive and negative ions as @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "we note that in the limit of @xmath80 ( i.e. , in the small - amplitude limit in which ions are inertialess and the characteristic scale length is much larger than the debye length ) , eqs . - yield the simple linear dispersion law ( in nondimensional form ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the wave frequency and the wave number of plane wave perturbations .",
    "equation shows that the wave becomes dispersionless with the phase speed smaller than the dust - acoustic speed @xmath84 .",
    "in other words , in a frame moving at the speed @xmath85 , the time derivatives of all physical quantities should vanish .",
    "thus , for a finite @xmath86 with @xmath87 , we can expect slow variations of the wave amplitude in the moving frame of reference , and so introduce the stretched coordinates as @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the nonlinear wave speed ( relative to the frame ) normalized by @xmath84 , to be shown to be equal to @xmath85 later .",

    "we , however , remember that @xmath95 and @xmath96 will explicitly appear in the coefficients of the terms associated with the landau damping , nonlinear and the dispersion in the kdv equation . in what follows ,",

    "also , if we set @xmath191 , i.e. if we neglect the strength of the landau damping associated with the ions then eq . reduces to the usual kdv equation which governs the small but finite amplitude nonlinear daws in unmagnetized dusty pair - ion plasmas .",
    "it is of interest to examine the range of values of the parameters for which the kdv equation ( without the landau damping ) is applicable to daws , and also to see the competition between nonlinearity and landau damping in determining whether or not an initial wave steepens . to this end",
    "we consider typical plasma parameters that are relevant to laboratory and space plasmas .",
    "for example , for laboratory plasmas @xcite ( in which the light positive ions are singly ionized potassium @xmath192 and heavy negative ions are @xmath193 ) , we can consider @xmath194 g , @xmath195 g , @xmath196ev@xmath197k , @xmath198ev@xmath199k , @xmath200 @xmath201 , @xmath202 @xmath201 , @xmath203 @xmath201 , @xmath204 v@xmath205 statv , @xmath206m@xmath207 cm and @xmath208 , so that we have [ assuming that @xmath188 ] @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 for positively ( negatively ) charged dusts .",
    "this implies that the nonlinear and the landau damping effects are larger than the finite debye length ( dispersive ) effects so that the kdv soliton theory is not applicable to daws .",
    "this is , in fact , true for the experiment described in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , for space plasma parameters @xcite ( e.g. , a dusty region at an altitude of about 95 km ) in which @xmath213 g",
