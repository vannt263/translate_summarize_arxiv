    "as subjective quality evaluation is time consuming , and can not be used for real time applications , mathematical models that approximate results of subjective quality assessment are needed .",

    "full - reference ( fr ) methods measure the perceived deviation between the degraded image and the original that is assumed to have perfect quality .",
    "while fr methods are based on the knowledge of the reference image , no - reference ( nr ) methods are designed in order to grade the image quality independently of the reference .",

    "section [ sec:12 ] reports the experimental results and finally concluding remarks are presented in section [ sec:16 ] .",
    "in this section , we present the framework of the proposed method based on statistical modeling of color components . if we consider the general framework of natural image statistics rriqa ( reduced reference image quality assessment ) scheme , the feature extraction process transforms the image in a suitable representation from which statistics are extracted . at the receiver side ,",
    "the same feature is extracted and compared to assess the visual quality .",
    "the deployment scheme of the proposed rriqa measure is given in figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "first , eventually , a color transformation of both original and distorted images is used to get the three color components .",
    "then , a spatial frequency domain representation is computed for each color component .",
    "based on a multivariate distribution model estimates of the distribution , parameters ( @xmath0 ) are computed on the three color sub - bands of the same decomposition level .",
    "finally , a dissimilarity distance is used in order to compute the distortion measure between the two images . in this context ,",
    "quality scores are strongly dependent on several parameters : the color space representation , the spatio - frequency transformation , the underlying distribution model together with the estimates of its parameters , and the adequacy of the dissimilarity measure .",

    "we introduce and justify the retained solutions for each element of this general scheme .",
    "this section gives an overview of the various elements of the quality assessment scheme .",
    "we start with a brief description of the four color spaces under investigation ( rgb , hsv , cielab , and ycrcb ) .",
    "then , we recall the mathematical description and the parameter estimation of the mggd model . finally , we define the overall distortion measure , which is expressed in terms of the proposed dissimilarity measurements ( kullback leibler divergence or geodesic distance ) .      in order to assess the influence of color on the quality",
    ", we choose to concentrate on four broadly used color spaces : three device dependent ( rgb , hsv , and ycrcb ) , and one device independent ( cielab ) .",
    "the basic rgb color space is selected due to its simplicity and suitability .",
    "it uses the additive color mixing for the three components red , green , and blue  @xcite .",
    "the hsv color space is retained because it is very intuitive in order to specify colors  @xcite .",
    "it breaks the color space into hue ( or color ) , saturation , and value ( or lightness ) . for this reason it is used in many image - processing applications .",
    "ycrcb separates rgb into luminance and chrominance information .",
    "y is the luma , which is very similar to luminance .",
    "cr is the component of red to green , and cb is the component of blue to yellow .",
    "it is a standard useful in analog television and digital video transmission .",
    "indeed , it has been designed to be efficient at encoding rgb values so they consume less space while retaining the full perceptual value .",
    "while these color spaces are perceptually non  linear , cielab has been designed to accurately map color perception . in other words , a unit change stimulus in cielab",
    "produce the same change in perception wherever it is applied .",
    "the three parameters that define the space are luminance , red to green , and blue to yellow . in general , to compute cielab components from rgb , it is necessary to apply a complete calibration or at least an estimation method  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we consider here only a standard transformation from the ciexyz color space to get an approximation of cielab color space .      in order to simulate the functionality of the early human visual system ( hvs ) components ,",
    "perceptual image quality assessment methods usually involve a channel decomposition process that transforms the image into different spatial frequency as well as orientation selective sub - bands .",
    "this process can be implemented using various multi - scale methods such as wavelet transform , laplacian pyramid transform and contourlet transform . in this work ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the steerable pyramid transform because it has proven to be effective in the image quality literature  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , evaluating the impact of the transformation used on the quality method is beyond the scope of this paper  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted there is still room for improvement at this level .      in this work ,",
    "we consider a particular case of the multivariate generalized gaussian distribution introduced by kotz  @xcite .",

    "+ table [ tab:2 ] reports typical values of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) goodness - of - fit test for the two alternative hypotheses .",
    "note that the smaller the ks value , the better the model fit with the empirical distribution .",
    "according to these results , the fits are quite satisfactory and support the use of mggd for modeling steerable pyramids coefficients .",
    "we can notice that the adequacy of the model depends of the color space representation .",
    "it is very effective for the rgb color space which is the most correlated one .",
    "differences are less pronounced between hsv , ycrcb and lab , even if results are better for the former .      at the receiver side ,",

    "the results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed measure with the kld distance as compared to its alternatives . indeed , according to plcc , it ranks first for nine type of distortion and when the entire dataset is used .",
    "rred gives better results in five situations ( high frequency noise , gaussian blur , image denoising , jpeg and jpeg 2000 ) , while the proposed measure using the gd distance performs better in three cases ( additive gaussian noise , non eccentricity pattern noise and mean shift ) .",
    "note that wnism never ranks first .",
    "results are quite similar when we observe the srcc values .",
    "kld is better for nine distortions types against four for rred and gd .",
    "however , differences remain small given the wide variety of distortions and their high intensities .",
    "the wnism method remains the less effective .",
    "+ the goal of a reduced reference image quality assessment measure is to provide the best compromise between prediction accuracy , feature numbers and computational time . in order to give an overall comparison of these methods , table  [ tab:11 ] summarizes all the information in order to compare the four methods .",
    "+ we note that the amount of information transmitted by rred is very high ( @xmath75 with @xmath33 is the size of the image in pixels ) . in the proposed measure ,",
    "the distribution of each sub - band coefficients is modeled by a trivariate mggd and the covariance matrix is of @xmath76 size . for each sub - band ,",
    "the scale and the shape parameters need to be transmitted together with six coefficients of the symmetric covariance matrix .",
    "so , the number of features involved in the quality evaluation process is equal to @xmath77 for six sub - bands . the number of features is lower for wnism but accuracy and monotonicity also .",
    "+ besides data rate and performances , we report the execution time of the four algorithms on an intel core i3 , cpus 3.3 ghz speed and 4 gb ram .",
    "note that the computation time is obtained by averaging the computation time required for ten randomly selected images from tid 2008 database .",
    "rred is the most efficient with an execution time of @xmath78 seconds per image followed by kld , which takes four times longer .",
    "the computation time for the gd method and wnism are very close .",
    "it is 1.5 times higher as compared to kld and about 6 times longer than the execution time of rred .",
    "in this paper , a new reduced reference method for color image quality assessment is introduced based on the natural image statistics paradigm . in order to take into account the dependencies between the color components ,",
    "we propose to use the multivariate generalized gaussian distribution model . in this context",
    ", the visual quality degradation can be computed using various color space and distances between the distributions estimated from the original and distorted images . in order to select the best compromise",
    ", we conducted an extensive comparative evaluation involving the tid 2008 dataset .",
    "four color spaces ( rgb , hsv , cielab , and ycrcb ) and two distances ( kullback - leibler divergence or the geodesic distance ) have been investigated . according to the overall evaluation of accuracy and monotonicity",
