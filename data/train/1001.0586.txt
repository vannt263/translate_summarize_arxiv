    "the problem of the packing of tetrahedra , which has modern - day applications to such wide - ranging topics as metamaterials with novel optical properties , nanomaterials @xcite , and virus formation , hails back to the early greeks @xcite .",
    "aristotle , in discussing the assignment of geometrical figures to `` heavenly bodies '' , mistakenly believed that regular tetrahedra ( `` pyramids '' ) tile ( euclidean ) space perfectly .",
    "nearly 1800 years later , johannes mller ( aka regiomontanus , 1436 - 1476 ) contradicted aristotle s claim @xcite .",
    "400 years after mller , minkowski showed that the densest lattice packing of any convex body must satisfy certain constraints @xcite and mistakenly argued that the densest lattice packing of tetrahedra ( i.e. one tetrahedron per unit cell ) had density @xmath1 @xcite . in 1900 , hilbert posed the problem of the densest lattice packing of regular tetrahedra as a special case of the 18th of his famous list of problems @xcite .",
    "grmer conjectured @xcite , and hoylman later proved @xcite , that the densest lattice packing of a single tetrahedron is @xmath2 .    in 1972 , stanislaw ulam conjectured that spheres would have the lowest maximum packing density of all convex bodies , including tetrahedra @xcite .",
    "that density is @xmath3 @xcite . in 2000 , betke and henk developed an efficient computer algorithm to compute the densest lattice packing of any convex body , and applied it to the archimedean solids @xcite .",
    "conway and torquato @xcite used betke and henk s algorithm to compute the packing density of tetrahedra derived from the densest lattice packing of icosahedra , and also examined other promising packings .",
    "all of them packed worse than spheres , with a maximum packing fraction @xmath4 .",
    "this led them to suggest the tantalizing possibility that the ulam conjecture might , in fact , fail for tetrahedra .",
    "they further proposed that tetrahedra might have the lowest packing density of all convex bodies . motivated by this , chaikin and coworkers",
    "@xcite performed experiments on tetrahedral dice packed in spherical and cylindrical containers .",
    "they reported random packings with densities as high as @xmath5 [ 16 ] and @xmath6 [ 17 ] , with the error arising from the rounded dice vertices and edges @xcite .    in 2008 , chen proposed a packing of nonamers ( nine tetrahedra forming two pentagonal dipyramids that share one tetrahedron ) arranged in layers , whose density ( @xmath7 ) clearly exceeded , for the first time , the maximum packing density of spheres @xcite . since chen s publication , a flurry of activity has resulted in successively higher and higher packing densities for tetrahedra .",
    "it was soon demonstrated that the nonamer crystal could be numerically compressed to slightly higher packing densities ( @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "the first _ disordered _ ( i.e.  non - periodic ) packing of tetrahedra to exceed the maximum packing density of spheres was reported by haji - akbari et al .",
    "@xcite ; they obtained a packing density of @xmath10 using monte carlo simulation of systems of 8000 tetrahedra compressed from random initial conditions .",
    "their disordered packing contains a preponderance of pentagonal dipyramids , arranged randomly and thus differently than in the chen structure , along with other motifs such as icosahedra .",
    "previously , all dense ordered packings proposed for tetrahedra were based on analytical construction ( or numerical compressions thereof ) .",
    "haji - akbari et al .  showed , using mc simulations of initially random systems containing up to nearly 22,000 tetrahedra , that at packing densities @xmath11 an equilibrium fluid of hard tetrahedra spontaneously transforms to a dodecagonal quasicrystal , which can be compressed to @xmath12 @xcite . by numerically constructing and then compressing four unit cells of a periodic quasicrystal approximant with an 82-tetrahedron unit cell",
    ", they obtained a packing density as high as @xmath13 .",
    "motivated by a numerical search , kallus , elser and gravel @xcite found a one - parameter family of dimer cluster packings obtained via an analytical construction with a density of @xmath14 , exceeding the density of the quasicrystal approximant .",
    "each dimer cluster contains two face - sharing tetrahedra , and is equivalent to a triangular dipyramid ( or bipyramid ) .",
    "two dimers comprise a single unit cell .",
    "torquato and jiao generalized the analytical construction of kallus et al .  to a _",
    "two_-parameter family of packings , and obtained an even denser packing with @xmath15 @xcite .    in this paper , we further generalize the kallus et al .  and torquato - jiao family of dimer cluster packings to consider a _ three_-parameter family of packings .",
    "we obtain a maximum packing density of @xmath16 as the optimal solution within the three - parameter family and show that the kallus et al .  and torquato - jiao packings are special cases of our more general construction . furthermore , we present numerical compression simulations of small systems of tetrahedra using standard isobaric monte carlo with variable simulation cell shape . for systems with 4 , 8 , 12 and 16 tetrahedra with initially random configurations , the analytically predicted dimer crystal with @xmath17",
    "is recovered .",
    "a _ dimer ( cluster ) _ is a basic building block formed by two face - sharing regular tetrahedra arranged into a triangular dipyramid .",

    "is called a _",
    "double dimer configuration_. if the configuration is free of overlaps , then it is a _",
    "double dimer packing_.    the set of possible double dimer configurations @xmath31 is a set of translates of the two dimers .",
    "we place the positive dimer @xmath32 at the origin and translate it by the lattice @xmath33 .",
    "the negative dimer @xmath34 is placed by the lattice coset @xmath35 . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath33 is spanned by @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and choose the offset of @xmath35 as @xmath39 ( equivalently @xmath40 , or @xmath41 ) , where the lattice vectors ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and the offset vector @xmath45 are free to vary .",
    "this means that @xmath46 we say a dimer is part of the _ @xmath47-th layer _ with @xmath48 .",
    "the even ( odd ) layers contain positive ( negative ) dimers .",
    "the lattice and offset vectors contain 12 coordinate variables , which means the set @xmath31 is a 12-dimensional linear space .",
    "however many of the configurations have overlaps , and thus are not packings .      in order to verify that the dimers of a double dimer configuration are not overlapping ( i.e.  that it is a packing ) , intersections of dimers with their neighbors are studied .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the dimer at the origin :    the space group of a double dimer configuration acts transitively on the dimers .",
    "the inversion @xmath49 maps positive dimers to negative dimers .",
    "intersections can occur between three types of simplices forming the surface of a dimer : triangular faces , edges , and vertices .",
    "given two simplices , we say the _ incidence condition _ for these simplices holds if their intersection is non - empty .",
    "incidence conditions are of either face - to - face , face - to - edge , face - to - vertex , edge - to - edge , edge - to - vertex or vertex - to - vertex type .",
    "next , we replace the simplices by affine subspaces and use the notation @xmath50=\\{p\\}$ ] to be the vertex @xmath19 , @xmath51=\\{p+\\kappa(q - p):\\kappa\\in\\mathbbm{r}\\}$ ] to be the line containing the edge from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , and @xmath52=\\{p+\\kappa(q - p)+\\lambda(r - p):\\kappa,\\lambda\\in\\mathbbm{r}\\}$ ] to be the plane containing the triangular face spanned by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we say the _ linear incidence condition _ holds if the intersection of two affine subspaces is non - empty . in the following we will consider linear incidence conditions only .",

    ".    the nine linear incidence conditions are sufficient for the statement that the dimer at the origin is not overlapping with the neighbors at @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 is invariant under inversion at the origin , so that we do not have to consider the neighbors at @xmath61 and @xmath62 separately .",
    "since the planes involved in the face - to - face condition @xmath63 are parallel , they coincide if they are incident , so we can alternatively write @xmath63 as an equation : @xmath64 with parameters @xmath65 .",
    "this equation is a vector equation and thus there is one scalar equation for each of its three components .",
    "two of the scalar equations are used to eliminate @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the remaining scalar equation is a single linear constraint for the components of the vectors @xmath45 and @xmath42 .",
    "similar constraints are obtained for the seven other face - to - face conditions .",
    "the edge - to - edge condition @xmath68 corresponds to the equation @xmath69 with parameters @xmath70 .",
    "again , a single linear constraint for the components of the vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 is obtained .",
    "the system of linear constraints turns out to have rank 9 , so the dimension of the space of double dimer configurations @xmath31 is reduced from 12 to 3 . with the new scalar parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the lattice vectors and the offset vector can be written as @xmath74    \\(i ) the eight face - to - face incidence conditions are important for dense packings , because the corresponding faces are parallel and therefore can be matched perfectly .",
    "\\(ii ) the face - to - face constraints imposed by @xmath75 and @xmath76 involve the faces spanned by @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath19 and @xmath23 , @xmath20 , @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we balance the constraints with an opposing edge - to - edge constraint with the neighbors at @xmath59 on the ` opposite ' edge spanned by @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 , @xmath21 in the form of the incidence condition @xmath77 .",
    "we now specify a subset @xmath78 of the three - parameter space that consists of double dimer packings only , and we later optimize density over this subset .    consider the restricted parameter space @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the parameterization in ( [ eq : generalbasis ] ) .",
    "each double dimer configuration @xmath81 is a packing .    since double dimer packings",
    "are transitive , it is sufficient to look for overlaps of @xmath24 only . we write a positive dimer as @xmath82 and a negative dimer as @xmath83 .",
    "the first part of the proof shows that we only need to consider the 26 neighbors with @xmath84 when looking for overlaps .",
    "note that @xmath85 has the shape of a sheared tetrahedron with the four vertices @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we verify that for each configuration corresponding to one of the four extremal points @xmath88 , the plane @xmath89 separates @xmath24 from @xmath90 and the plane @xmath91 separates @xmath24 from @xmath92 .",
    "this shows that @xmath93 . by similar arguments we get @xmath94 and @xmath95 . since @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 are linear in @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath85 is convex , the separating planes and the restrictions @xmath84 remain valid for every double dimer configuration in @xmath85 .    by construction of @xmath96 in lemma [",
    "lem : reducedim ] we know that the ten dimers @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 do not overlap with @xmath102 .",

    "we find similar planes for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , which shows that these six dimers can not overlap with @xmath102 .",
    "finally note that pairs of positive neighbors are related by inversion symmetry .",
    "these considerations reduce the number of neighbors that have to be checked from 26 to five .",

    "overlaps can only appear in one of the half - spaces , and the half - spaces that are free from overlaps are : @xmath120 the intersection of the four half - spaces is the restricted parameter space @xmath85 .",
    "the condition @xmath121 is different from the other ones , since it is a vertex - to - edge condition .",

    "the dodecagonal quasicrystal is the only ordered phase observed to form from random initial configurations of large collections of tetrahedra at moderate densities .",
    "it is thus interesting to note that for some certain values of @xmath163 , when the small systems do not form the dimer lattice packing , they instead prefer clusters ( motifs ) present in the quasicrystal and its approximant , predominantly pentagonal dipyramids .",
    "this suggests that the two types of packings  the dimer crystal and the quasicrystal / approximant  may compete , raising interesting questions about the relative stability of the two very different structures at finite pressure . these questions will be explored in a forthcoming paper .",
