    "two parallel metallic plates attract one another at zero temperature due to fluctuations of the quantum electromagnetic field in vacuum .",
    "this is the well - known casimir effect ; for a nice introduction see reference @xcite , for an exhausting review see @xcite .",
    "the extension of casimir s result to arbitrary temperatures and to general dielectric plates was made by lifshitz et al .",
    "@xcite , with a subsequent treatment of delicate points by schwinger et al . @xcite .",
    "the casimir force between two disconnected conductor objects of different shapes , like a rectilinear wall and a sphere , is also treatable @xcite by using a method due to derjaguin .",
    "the general form of the casimir free energy for ideal - conductor walls of arbitrary smooth shapes was derived by balian and duplantier @xcite using multiple scattering expansions ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in the classical ( or high - temperature ) limit defined by the validity of the equipartitioning energy law ,",
    "the casimir forces between _ disconnected _ boundaries become purely entropic @xcite , and as such depend only on the geometry of the boundaries . for accurate experimental measurements of the casimir effect",
    "see @xcite .    there is a permanent interest in the casimir effect and related phenomena in equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical charged fluids , i.e. models of non - quantum charged particles which do not incorporate the magnetic part of the lorentz force due to charge currents .",
    "although such purely electrostatic models ignore the magnetic degree of freedom ( whose effect has the same magnitude as that of the coulomb force in the case of conducting walls ) , they can be used in more complex experimental situations to reveal microscopic mechanisms behind macroscopic electrostatics .",
    "these classical electrostatic forces are also called van der waals forces .",
    "the statistical models confined by walls can be divided , in general , into two sets : the semi - infinite systems , in which at least one of the spatial coordinates is unconstrained by the walls , and the fully - finite systems .",
    "the applied methods and observed phenomena usually depend on this classification . here",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the semi - infinite confining geometries , namely the polarizable interface ( figure 1 ) and the two - slab geometry ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the fully - finite geometries will be treated in a subsequent paper .",
    "the studied models include the possibility of the presence of an electrolyte between the conducting walls .",
    "it is generally believed that the long - ranged casimir force between the fluctuating walls is screened by this electrolyte .",
    "such an intuitively expected behaviour was supported longtime ago by an approximate poisson - boltzmann analysis of an electrolyte between two dielectric slabs @xcite . a reasonable , but",
    "not rigorously justified , assumption was made : the electrostatic - field fluctuations in the walls , responsible for the long - ranged attractive casimir force , can be treated separately from the pure image effects of the `` inert '' walls on the charged constituents of the electrolyte .",
    "hereinafter , we refer to this assumption as the `` separation hypothesis '' .",
    "considering then the pure effect of images on the electrolyte particles , a repulsive long - ranged force of the same amplitude as the casimir one , but in the opposite direction , occurs in the electrolyte .",
    "following the basic separation hypothesis , the two long - ranged forces cancel exactly with one another ; we shall refer to this cancellation phenomenon as the screening effect . by the use of the separation hypothesis ,",
    "this screening effect was also observed for an electrolyte between two conducting walls @xcite .",
    "the presence of the repulsive long - ranged force in the electrolyte ( modelled by the coulomb gas ) has been proven at arbitrary temperature , by using perfect - screening sum rules , for ideal - conductor @xcite and ideal - dielectric @xcite inert slab walls .",
    "interestingly , in the special case when @xmath0 ( plain hard walls separating the electrolyte from vacuum ) , there is neither an attractive casimir force between the slabs nor a repulsive force in the electrolyte induced by the particle images in the inert walls ( in fact , there are no images ) .",
    "the corresponding field theory was developed in a series of works by dean and horgan @xcite .    in references",
    "@xcite , and in a recent work @xcite about the microscopic origin of universality in casimir forces , the conducting walls in empty space are modelled by two slabs filled with a classical plasma of charged particles in thermal equilibrium . at large distances between the two slabs , the casimir force ( in the electrostatic regime )",
    "is retrieved as a result of perfect - screening sum rules .",
    "a natural continuation of the strategy is to replace the ideal conductor walls by a microscopic plasma system in more general physical situations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study casimir and related effects in model systems with geometries presented in figures 1 and 2 , in which the confining walls are made of a symmetric two - component plasma ( coulomb gas ) of point - like particles with @xmath1 unit charges in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the coulomb gas is chosen for the sake of its simplicity ; most of the obtained results can be easily generalized to multi - component plasmas . in the presence of an electrolyte ( which is simply another coulomb gas with a different particle fugacity ) between the walls , the microscopic description of the walls",
    "enables us to mimic coherently the effect of electrostatic fluctuations inside the walls and the image forces acting on the electrolyte particles , without any ad - hoc separation ansatz .",
    "the wall - plasma is not required to be ideal , there might be a finite nonzero correlation length which describes the correlation effects among the charged particles .",
    "if there is no electrolyte in the region between the two slabs ( figure 2 ) , the casimir force is obtained in the limit of a large wall separation , together with a leading correction term due to the non - ideality of the conductor wall .",
    "if there is an electrolyte between the two slabs , the casimir force is shown to be screened by this electrolyte , which confirms the validity of the separation ( fluctuations - images ) hypothesis .",
    "interestingly , the residual short - ranged force between the slabs is always attractive . as a by - product of the treatment",
    ", we consider also the ideal - conductor regime of the walls when the correlation length of the charged particles forming the walls goes to zero .",
    "the surface tension of the electrolyte turns out to be independent of the electrostatic field fluctuations in the ideal - conductor walls .",
    "the analogous independence of the density profile and particle correlation functions was previously noted @xcite .    the spatial dimension of the studied models will be @xmath2 . in dimension @xmath3 ,",
    "the coulomb potential @xmath4 at a spatial position @xmath5 , induced by a unit charge at the origin @xmath6 , is the solution of the poisson equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the surface area of the @xmath3-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "explicitly , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a free length scale .",
    "the definition ( [ 1.1 ] ) of the coulomb potential implies in the fourier space the characteristic small-@xmath12 behaviour @xmath13 in any dimension .",
    "this maintains many generic properties ( like screening @xcite ) of `` real '' 3d coulomb systems .",
    "the interaction energy of charged particles @xmath14 , immersed in a homogeneous medium of dielectric constant = 1 , is @xmath15 .",
    "the models are treated in the grand canonical ensemble characterized by the inverse temperature @xmath16 and by the couple of equivalent ( there is no external electrostatic potential ) particle fugacities @xmath17 .",
    "the whole domain @xmath18 on which the system is defined can be separated into disjunct subdomains , @xmath19 . within the grand canonical formalism , each subdomain is characterized by a constant fugacity , @xmath20 for @xmath21 , which may vary from one region to the other .",
    "the choice @xmath22 corresponds to a vacuum subdomain with no particles allowed to occupy the space .",
    "the grand partition function is defined by @xmath23 \\exp\\left [ -\\beta \\sum_{i < j } q_i q_j   v(\\vert { \\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j \\vert ) \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the number of positively ( negatively ) charged particles and @xmath26 .",
    "the averaged particle densities are generated from @xmath27 in a standard way as functional derivatives with respect to the fugacity field . at the one - particle level ,",
    "one introduces the number density of particles of one sign , @xmath28 due to the charge symmetry , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total density of particles . at the two - particle level ,",
    "one introduces the two - body densities @xmath31 it is useful to consider also the ( truncated ) pair correlation functions @xmath32 for the case of point - like particles , the singularity of the coulomb potential ( [ 1.2 ] ) at the origin often prevents the thermodynamic stability against the collapse of positive - negative pairs of charges : in 2d for small enough temperatures , in 3d for any temperature .",
    "in particular , in 2d , the boltzmann factor of a pair of @xmath1 unit charges , @xmath33 , is integrable at short distances provided that @xmath34 . to cross the collapse point @xmath35",
    ", the pure coulomb potential has to be regularized by a short - distance repulsion , e.g. , a hard - core potential . in 3d , the short - distance regularization is needed at any temperature ( except in the high - temperature limit described by the debye - hckel approximation which gives a thermodynamically stable description for point - like charges ) .",
    "two methods are applied .",
    "we first use the debye - hckel method of the coulomb - bond chain resummation within the density mayer expansion , valid in the high - temperature limit and applicable to both 2d and 3d systems . the standard approach dealing with inhomogeneous density profiles @xcite",
    "has to be supplemented by the first equation of the bgy hierarchy .",
    "we rather use the version developed in @xcite which does not require some additional information ; we also introduce some technicalities which substantially simplify the calculation of the casimir forces .",
    "we also use the debye - hckel method in the case of dielectric walls , using the separation hypothesis which does not require any microscopic model for these walls .",
    "the second method applies exclusively to the 2d coulomb gas whose exact solution ( ursell functions ) can be obtained just at the collapse temperature @xmath35 by a mapping onto the thirring model at the free - fermion point @xcite .",
    "the free - fermion model is solvable also in many inhomogeneous situations and the corresponding method can be adapted to the present problems .",
    "the fact that , in 2d , one can verify whether some features of the mean - field behaviour predicted by the debye - hckel analysis persist also at a specific finite temperature is of importance .",
    "we add that , based on a recent progress in the integrable @xmath36 dimensional quantum field theory @xcite , the thermodynamics of the 2d coulomb gas was solved exactly in the whole stability region @xmath34 , in the bulk @xcite as well as for interface geometries with an ideal - conductor @xcite and an ideal - dielectric @xcite walls ; however , for @xmath34 , the exact @xmath30-body densities are not known , and we shall not consider the case @xmath34 in the present paper .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , for the two - slab geometry ( figure 2 ) with general dielectric walls , by using a phenomenological approach , it is shown , under certain conditions , that the electric field fluctuations can be decoupled from the image - particle forces .",
    "the separation hypothesis is then tested on the microscopic models , first in the debye - hckel limit ( section 3 ) and then at the free - fermion point of the thirring representation of the 2d coulomb gas ( section 4 ) . a brief recapitulation and concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "a general argument in favour of the separation hypothesis has been given in the case of conducting walls @xcite .",
    "after a minor modification , the same argument can be used for dielectric walls of arbitrary dielectric constant @xmath37 . for the sake of completeness , we repeat the argument .",
    "we consider , in @xmath3 dimensions , a coulomb gas partially or totally bounded by walls @xmath38 made of a dielectric with a dielectric constant @xmath37 .",
    "we want to take into account the thermal fluctuations of the walls .",
    "it happens that a detailed knowledge of the internal structure of the walls is not necessary ; we only assume that this internal structure is described by a set of coordinates @xmath39 .",
    "classical ( non - quantum ) statistical mechanics is supposed to be applicable .",
    "we shall need a correlation function defined for the wall system supposed to be alone in space .",
    "let @xmath40 be the electric potential created by the walls at some point @xmath5 and let @xmath41 be a truncated statistical average computed with the boltzmann weight of the walls alone .",
    "this correlation function , when both @xmath5 and @xmath42 are outside the walls , can be computed by linear response theory , by a simple adaptation of reference @xcite .",
    "let us put a point charge @xmath43 at @xmath42 .",
    "its interaction with the walls results into the addition to the hamiltonian of a term @xmath44 . the average electric potential at @xmath5",
    "is changed by @xmath45 with @xmath46 determined by macroscopic electrostatics .",
    "for instance , in the case of one plane wall ,",
    "@xmath47v({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'^*)$ ] where @xmath4 is the coulomb interaction ( 1.2 ) and @xmath48 is the image of @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath49 be that part of @xmath46 due to the walls ( not to @xmath43 itself ) : @xmath50 if @xmath43 is infinitesimal , linear response theory states that @xmath51 , therefore @xmath52 furthermore , we can assume that the fluctuations of @xmath40 are gaussian , because , in a macroscopic description with a constant @xmath37 , the response of the walls to the external charge @xmath43 is linear even for a non - infinitesimal charge ( if the response of a spring to an applied force is linear , it means that the spring is harmonic , and its spontaneous thermal fluctuations will be gaussian ) .",
    "we now come back to the full system coulomb gas plus walls , the partition function of which will be considered .",
    "let @xmath53 be the potential energy of the walls , @xmath54 the set of the particle coordinates of of the coulomb gas .",
    "the total potential energy of the system ( coulomb gas plus @xmath38 ) is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the charge and coordinates of the @xmath58th particle of the coulomb gas .",
    "let @xmath59 the phase space element ( after integration on the momenta ) of the coulomb gas .",
    "the partition function @xmath60 of the total system can be written as @xmath61 \\right\\rangle_0   \\exp\\left [ - \\beta \\sum_{i < j } q_i q_j v({\\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j ) \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath62 means the average over @xmath39 with the weight @xmath63 $ ] , and @xmath64 is the partition function of the walls alone . since the fluctuations of @xmath65 are gaussian and @xmath66 , @xmath67 \\right\\rangle_0 = \\exp\\left [ \\case12 \\beta^2\\sum_{i , j } q_i q_j   \\langle \\phi_w({\\bf r}_i)\\phi_w({\\bf r}_j)\\rangle_0^{\\rm t } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{2.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the partition function can be factorized ( separated ) as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the partition function of the coulomb gas computed with the effective hamiltonian @xmath70 @xmath71 is the standard hamiltonian of a coulomb gas in presence of inert dielectric walls .",
    "for instance , in the case of one plane dielectric wall , the first term of @xmath71 is the interaction of each particle with its own image , while the second term is the interaction of each particle with the other ones and the images of the other ones .",
    "let @xmath72 be any microscopic quantity which does not depend on @xmath39 .",
    "using the same kind of steps as for the calculation of the partition function @xmath60 , one can show that this average can be calculated with @xmath71 only : @xmath73 in particular , the densities and many - body correlations in the coulomb gas can be calculated with @xmath71 and therefore are unaffected by the fluctuations in the walls .    on the contrary ,",
    "the total partition function ( [ 2.6 ] ) does involve @xmath64 , and therefore the fluctuations in the walls enter the total free energy ; if a wall is displaced , the variation of the free energy , and therefore the force acting on this wall , will be affected by the fluctuations in the walls .    in the above , simple manipulations allow to replace the partition function @xmath69 of the coulomb gas by the corresponding grand partition function @xmath74 also computed with the hamiltonian @xmath71 . therefore , the grand potential of the total system is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the grand potential of the coulomb gas computed with the hamiltonian @xmath71 and @xmath77 is the free energy of the wall system alone in space .",
    "furthermore , we have considered the case when the coulomb gas is made of charged particles in vacuum .",
    "a more realistic model for an electrolyte takes into account the solvent by picturing it as a continuous dielectric medium with a dielectric constant @xmath78 .",
