    "the study of @xmath7 correlation functions ( cf ) ( along with the study of other two - particle correlations such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) allows one to obtain the information about the character of evolution of the matter formed in relativistic nuclear collisions , in particular about the character of collective flow .",
    "another great possibility which is open for a researcher in baryon-(anti)baryon correlation analysis is the study of strong interaction between the particles of different sorts with final state interaction ( fsi ) correlation technique @xcite . since lhc produces copiously hadrons of different species , including multi - strange , charmed and beauty ones , the advantage of this approach is the ability to analyze the interactions even in exotic particle pairs , hardly achieved by other means .",
    "fitting the experimental correlation function with some analytical formula , e.  g.  lednick - lyuboshitz model @xcite , allows one to extract the quantities describing both the interaction in corresponding pairs and the particle emission region size .",
    "of course , if the source function  @xmath10 , describing the spatial structure of the pair emission , is known , an extraction of unknown interaction parameters becomes more reliable . the corresponding spatial structure can be obtained from realistic collision model that simulates the evolution of the system formed in high energy heavy ion collisions . in the recent paper  @xcite the hybrid variant of the hydrokinetic model ( hkm )  @xcite",
    "was used for this purpose .",
    "the choice of hkm is highly reliable since it is known to provide a successful simultaneous description of a wide class of bulk observables in nuclear collision experiments at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "the model also reproduces well  @xcite the source functions for pion and kaon pairs in au+au collisions at the top rhic energy  @xcite , including non - gaussian tails observed in certain experimental source function projections .    in  @xcite in order to extract unknown @xmath11 scattering length ,",
    "the corresponding experimental correlation function for 10% most central au+au collisions at top rhic energy , measured by star collaboration  @xcite , was fitted with the lednick - lyuboshitz formula using the effective source radius @xmath12 extracted from the hkm source function .",
    "it was also found that @xmath12 values obtained in hkm for baryon - baryon and baryon - antibaryon correlations are expectedly close , while in the star experimental analysis  @xcite , where the source radii were considered as free fit parameters , the extracted @xmath13 radius was @xmath14 times smaller than the @xmath7 one .",
    "one can assume that this apparent difference is due to neglect of residual correlations in  @xcite .",
    "such correlations can exist between secondary protons and lambdas if their parents were correlated ( or the parent of one particle was correlated with another particle in the pair ) . for taking into account the residual correlation contribution to the baryon - antibaryon cf , a modified analytical formula was introduced in  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "a good description of the experimental @xmath13 correlation function is obtained and the @xmath13 spin - averaged scattering length is extracted from the corresponding fit .    in the present paper we are going to apply the method developed in  @xcite for description of the rhic data to predict the @xmath7 and @xmath13 correlation functions in the 5% most central pb+pb collisions at the lhc energy @xmath4  tev , utilizing the results of ref .",

    "the latter is defined as the fraction of pairs consisting of primary , correctly identified particles .    as well as in",

    "this formula is derived starting from the basic equation @xmath22 , where the wave function @xmath23 represents the stationary solution of the scattering problem with the opposite sign of the vector @xmath24 .",
    "the angle brackets mean averaging over the total spin @xmath25 and the distribution of the relative distances @xmath26 .",
    "since typically the source radius can be considered much larger than the range of the strong interaction potential , @xmath23 can be approximated at small @xmath27 by the s - wave solution in the outer region : @xmath28 the scattering amplitude @xmath29 here is taken in the effective range approximation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the scattering length and @xmath32 is the effective radius for a given total spin @xmath33 or @xmath34 . the singlet and triplet weights @xmath35 for unpolarized particles ( supposing the polarization @xmath36 ) are in @xmath37 and @xmath38 correspondingly .",
    "as for the baryon - antibaryon case , following  @xcite , we fit the experimentally measured correlation function  @xmath39 with the following analytical expression @xmath40 where @xmath18 is purity or the fraction of correctly identified pairs consisting of primary particles , @xmath41 is `` true '' correlation function approximated by eq .  ( [ ll ] )",

    "the latter is taken in the gaussian form  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the annihilation ( wide ) dip amplitude and @xmath47 is the dip inverse width . since @xmath48 and @xmath49 enter ( [ cfunc ] ) only as a product @xmath50 , the latter is treated as a single parameter @xmath51 at fitting .",
    "the source radii @xmath12 in both @xmath5 and @xmath11 cases are extracted from the gaussian fit @xmath52 to the angle averaged source function , @xmath53 calculated in the hydrokinetic model  @xcite .",
    "the latter simulates the evolution of the matter in relativistic nuclear collision as consisting of two stages  the hydrodynamic expansion of the matter being in local thermal and chemical equilibrium and gradual system decoupling , beginning when the equilibrium is lost .",
    "the first stage is described within ideal hydrodynamics and for the second one the hydrokinetic approach is utilized , based on the boltzmann equations in the integral form , with switching to urqmd cascade at a space - like hypersurface . in current study hkm is taken in its simplified hybrid form  @xcite with sudden switch from hydrodynamic evolution to the cascade at the hadronization hypersurface defined by the isotherm @xmath54  mev .",

    "the parameter @xmath87 describes the strength of residual correlations and the fraction of residually correlated non - primary particles .",
    "so , this parameter depends on particle interaction kinematics .",
    "thus , it also can be taken the same as for rhic , @xmath88 .",
    "as for the @xmath89 parameter , being some effective size associated with residual correlations ( @xmath90  fm ) , one can suppose that for lhc it will be larger than for rhic , approximately proportionally to the source radii ratio @xmath91 , i.  e. @xmath92 .",
    "such an assumption gives @xmath93  fm .",
    "changing by such a close to unity factor . ]",
    "note , that since the mentioned parameter values have errors , the lhc correlation function can not be predicted exactly , but only up to uncertainties caused by these errors in the fit parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in the predicted correlation function is calculated as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 are the 4 fit parameters , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath51 and @xmath89 , @xmath96 are the corresponding parameter standard errors , and @xmath97 are the covariances of parameters @xmath95 and @xmath98 .",
    "the determination of purity @xmath99 at the lhc is not so explicit , since it depends not only on the fraction of secondary pairs , coming from resonance decays , but also on the experimental setup , or more precisely , on the fraction of misidentified pairs . to clarify this issue",
    "we have calculated the fractions of pairs made by particles having different origination ( primary or coming from certain decays ) in the hydrokinetic model for rhic and lhc collisions .",
    "the results obtained in both cases are quite close and are presented in table  i. comparing these fractions with those in table  iii for rhic  @xcite , one can see that experimental fraction of @xmath100 pairs @xmath101 is about 2.5 times lower than in hkm , likely due to misidentification problem , which takes place in the experiment .",
    "in hkm simulations , on the contrary , all the produced particles are correctly identified , that leads to such a difference between corresponding fraction values . however , since hkm is a realistic model that describes both rhic and lhc bulk observables well , basing on its results one can conclude , that true purities , understood as the fractions of primary pairs , at rhic and lhc should be quite similar .",

    "they are expressed ( as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ cfunc ] ) ) through the uncorrected ones as @xmath107 .",
    "the latter `` true '' function can be easily compared with the experimental result ( corrected in the same way for purity and residual correlations ) , since it does not depend on the fraction of misidentified particles in the concrete experiment . as compared to rhic ,",
    "the lhc curve apparently has smaller amplitude and width .",
    "the first predictions for @xmath5 and @xmath11 correlation functions , calculated within lednick - lyuboshitz and hydrokinetic ( hkm ) models and accounting for the residual correlation effect , are presented for the 5% most central pb+pb lhc collisions at the energy @xmath4  tev .",
    "the functions behavior is predicted based on the results previously obtained for au+au collisions at the top rhic energy .",
    "the pair purities ( the fractions of pairs consisting of primary particles ) , calculated in hkm for rhic and lhc are very close and are about 2.5 times larger than the experimental primary pairs fraction in the star collaboration experiment at the rhic .",
    "this difference is most probably because of particle misidentification problem existing in the experiment .",
    "that is why we present results for purity uncorrected @xmath11 correlation functions in two variants : with purity @xmath99 similar to that in the experiment at rhic and with rhic purity scaled by a factor of 2.5 , that corresponds to hkm purity .",
    "the measured lhc correlation function should lie somewhere between these two limiting possibilities . depending on the concrete experimental setup and the related fraction of misidentified particles , the real curve can be closer either to one or to another variant .",
    "we also demonstrate the purity and residual correlation corrected baryon - antibaryon cf which should not depend on the experiment details and thus can be easily compared with experimental result .",
