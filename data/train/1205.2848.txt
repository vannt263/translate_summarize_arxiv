    "the quality of the connecting links and cables is most often a crucial aspect of electric and electronic systems . at low frequency ( from the audio range down to dc ) , where the inductive contributions are negligible ,",
    "the connecting links are characterized in terms of their series resistance and of their parallel conductance and capacitance to ground or to other neighbouring conductors .",
    "these are the main electrical quantities which must be considered in the evaluation of the quality of a connecting link and of its compliance with the performance of the system .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with high impedance signal links , carrying low frequency voltage signals from a capacitive or resistive source to an ideal voltage amplifier with infinite input impedance .",
    "this excludes effects due to high current flow and power dissipation in the links .",
    "examples are the read out of the cuore @xcite and lucifer @xcite experiments , where thermistors inside a cryostat , whose impedance is in the g@xmath1 range , are connected to the front end amplifiers at room temperature through high impedance connecting links a few meters long . the signal bandwidth in this case extends from dc up to about 100 hz .    in describing the modelization of connecting links , we assume each cable to be individually shielded , so that the dominant parasitic contributions are between each link and ground . the parasitic components to neighbouring connecting links will not be considered in the following , but all the models could be straightforwardly extended to account for them .",
    "according to the basic model , each section of the cable of length @xmath2 can be modeled with the three impedances @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , accounting for the series resistance , parallel parasitic conductance and parallel capacitance respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are considered per unit length , and if the cable is not homogeneous their values depend on their position @xmath6 along the cable , going from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the length of the cable .",
    "this model is depicted in the left hand side of figure [ basicmodel ] for a cable element of length @xmath2 ; integrating over the cable length from @xmath7 to @xmath8 gives the impedance of the entire cable .    for the moment , let us consider the cable to be homogeneous , and drop the dependence of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 from the position @xmath6 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are still considered per unit length ) .",
    "there are two time constants involved : @xmath13 gives the order of magnitude of the low pass effect for a cable of length @xmath9 , while @xmath14 gives the order of magnitude of the boundary between the dc regime , where @xmath11 dominates over @xmath12 , and the ac regime , where @xmath12 dominates over @xmath11 .",
    "this second time constant does not depend on @xmath9 . unless the cable is extremely long , extremely thin , or of a very poor quality , the first time constant is smaller than the second of several order of magnitudes .",
    "we are here interested in the very low frequency behaviour of the connecting link , and we will thus neglect @xmath10 in the following . the paper will focus on the model depicted in the right hand side of figure [ basicmodel ] , probing its adequacy in describing the connecting link on the time scale of @xmath14 , and extending it to account for measured deviations .",
    "the setup used for a frequency dependent measurement of the cable is shown in figure [ setup ] . a national instruments 6281 card was used to generate a test sinusoidal signal @xmath15 , with settable frequency .",
    "the test signal was applied at one end of the cable , while the other end was left open .",
    "the shielding of the cable was connected to ground through a resistor @xmath16 .",
    "the cable was held at the constant temperature of 30 @xmath17c inside a vtsch vt7004 climatic chamber .",
    "the same ni 6281 which generates the test signal was used to acquire it , while another ni 6281 was used to acquire the signal @xmath18 on the shielding .",
    "the reason why two ni 6281 cards were used instead of one is to avoid switching the same input between @xmath18 and @xmath15 , which would affect the measurement of @xmath18 , which is at high impedance .    for each frequency value between 10 @xmath0hz and 10 hz ,",
    "five periods of the test sine wave were applied to the cable and acquired .",
    "the first two are necessary to allow the transients to disappear .",
    "the last three periods were fitted with sine waves , extracting the amplitude and phase of @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "the transfer function of the setup is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the impedance of the cable .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath16 is much larger or much smaller than @xmath20 , the setup can not achieve a good sensitivity .",
    "for this reason , two values for @xmath16 were used in the characterization : 10 g@xmath1 for the lower part of the spectrum , where @xmath20 is larger , and 1 m@xmath1 for the upper part of the spectrum , where @xmath20 is smaller .",
    "the whole spectrum of @xmath20 versus frequency was then reconstructed over a wide frequency range .",
    "the fit of the measured @xmath20 was performed by considering both its amplitude and phase at the same time , by minimizing the distance in the complex plane given by @xmath21 as a function of the fit parameters @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 are the frequency values , @xmath24 the measured ( complex ) values of the transfer function at each frequency @xmath23 , and @xmath25 is the fitting function , which depends on the fit parameters @xmath22 . the complex distance defined in [ complexdist ] is normalized by the module of @xmath24 : in this way the fit is not biased towards the points where the sampled function is larger .",
    "for a given cable of length @xmath9 , the basic model at the right of figure [ basicmodel ] gives the following expression for the cable impedance @xmath20 : @xmath26 dx = g_c + s c_c , \\label{basicimp}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the total conductance of the cable , and @xmath28 is its total capacitance .",
    "figure [ basicfit ] shows the plot of the impedance versus frequency for a cable about four meters long , made of 13 differential pairs , connected together giving an equivalent cable made of only 2 conductors .",
    "one of the two conductors is considered to be the shielding , just for clarity . in this way , the parasitic conductance and capacitance of each pair of the cable appear multiplied by 13 .",
    "the low frequency characterization extends down to 10 @xmath0hz .",
    "the data were fitted with the function given by [ basicimp ] , that is , rearranging the terms , @xmath29 where @xmath30 = @xmath31 and @xmath32 = @xmath33 .",
    "the plot shows in orange the best fitting curve obtained with the basic model : the fit gives @xmath30 = 36.7 g@xmath1 and @xmath32 = 15.2 nf .",
    "it is clear looking at figure [ basicfit ] that with these values there is no agreement between the data and the basic model in the higher portion of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the capacitance value obtained with this fit does not match the value of capacitance that is seen at high frequency by measuring the cable with a capacitance meter , which is 4.8 nf .    in the same plot , green curves ,",
    "the fit was forced with @xmath33 = 4.8 nf , to match the capacitance value measured at high frequency with the impedance meter . in this case , the fitting curve matches the higher frequency values of the measured curve , but there is a large discrepancy in the middle range .",
    "it is then clear that the basic model , with only the two parameters @xmath30 = @xmath31 and @xmath32 = @xmath33 , fails to accurately describe the behaviour of the cable impedance in the very low frequency range between dc and 1 hz .",
    "the discrepancy between the measured data and the basic model , together with the fact that the measurement with the capacitance meter gives a capacitance value which is about 1/3 of the value which comes from the fit with the basic model , suggest the need to extend the basic model .",
    "the main feature of an extended model would need to be the presence of an additional capacitance that is hidden in the higher portion of the spectrum , and becomes relevant only below 1 hz .",
    "the elementary cable element of length @xmath2 can be modified to account for the additional capacitance , as depicted in figure [ extmodel ] .",
    "an additional capacitance was added , whose value is hidden at high frequency because of the resistance it has in series .",
    "the physical motivation for this is not hard to accept : since the capacitance between two electrodes increases with decreasing distance , and since there is a conductive path between the inner and outer conductors of the cable , modeled by @xmath4 , it is reasonable that an intermediate contribution can arise , given by the series combination of a conductive path @xmath34 and a capacitance @xmath35 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is expected to be larger than @xmath5 , since the distance between its electrodes is smaller , and the value of @xmath34 is expected to be larger than @xmath4 , since it represents only a fraction of the conductive path between the inner and outer conductors of the cable . like @xmath4 , the conductance @xmath34 is essentially a parasitic effect . if the dielectric between the 2 conductors were a perfect insulator , @xmath36 would be zero anywhere in the cable .",
    "the imperfections in the dielectric give to @xmath36 finite values randomly distributed along the cable .",
    "the impedance of the entire cable of length @xmath9 according to this model is given by @xmath37 dx=\\ ] ] @xmath38    the result is the same as in the case of the basic model , except for the last term within the integral sign .",
    "this last term is not easily evaluated , unless an assumption about the distribution of @xmath35 and @xmath39 is made . in [ extimp ]",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath40 would actually be the lower limits for @xmath41 and @xmath36 .",
    "we prefer to consider them as independent parameters because they are directly measurable .    as in the case of the basic model , the dependence of the impedance values with the position @xmath6 along the cable accounts for the fact that the cable is not homogenous .",
    "the last term of [ extimp ] can be simplified with an approximation .",
    "since the capacitance value is mostly due to the geometry of the cable , while the parasitic conductance is due to impurities in the dielectric between the conductors , we expect @xmath35 to be much more homogenous than @xmath34 .",
    "we can thus drop the dependance of @xmath41 with @xmath6 .",
    "we can also define the time constant @xmath42 = @xmath43 , and rewrite [ extimp ] as @xmath44    we can now make an assumption about the distribution of @xmath42 . in a real situation , @xmath42 would be randomly distributed between two extreme values , defined as @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to a first order approximation , we can assume it to be uniformely distributed : @xmath47 by writing this , we are also implicitly assuming that the values of @xmath42 are sorted along the cable from @xmath6 = 0 to @xmath6 = l. this is not physically reasonable if intended literally .",
    "but since the contribution of each element of length @xmath2 is independent of the others , we can without loss of generality assume that they could be arranged in an ideal experiment to obtain the case in which the smallest value of @xmath42 , which is @xmath45 , occurs at @xmath6 = 0 , while the largest value , which is @xmath46 , occurs at @xmath6 = l. a similar approach , from which we were inspired , is commonly used to model the statistics of @xmath48 noise in electronic components @xcite .    by substituting [ tauass ] into [ extimp2 ]",
    ", we can solve the integral , obtaining @xmath49 the homogeneity condition could be recovered by calculating the limit for @xmath50 . but instead , it is more physically reasonable to let @xmath51 0 , meaning that @xmath42 is bound only from above , i.e. there is a minimum value for @xmath39 , but not an upper limit ( remembering that @xmath33 is the lower limit for the capacitance ) .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that , for very large values of @xmath36 or above a given frequency , the capacitance @xmath33 dominates the parasitic impedance , and the contribution of @xmath36 and @xmath41 disappears .        with this last approximation ,",
    "the inverse of the cable impedance becomes ( also renaming @xmath46 as @xmath52 ) : @xmath53    the measured cable impedance was then fitted with the following function : @xmath54 where @xmath30 = @xmath31 and @xmath32 = @xmath33 , as in [ fitfunc1 ] , @xmath55 = @xmath41 , @xmath56 = @xmath52 , and the symbol @xmath57 indicates the parallel combination of the two impedances .",
    "the measured data and the best fit with this function are shown in the double plot of figure [ extendedfit ] .",
    "the curve nicely fits the data , both in amplitude and phase .",
    "the values obtained from the fit are @xmath31=37.0 g@xmath1 , @xmath33 = 4.84 nf , @xmath41 = 11.4 nf and @xmath52 = 2.02 s. the value obtained from the fit for @xmath33 matches perfectly the value measured at high frequency with a capacitance meter .",
    "this evaluation was carried out also on different cables , finding similar results , and suggesting the general applicability of the extended model .",
    "to check the physical meaningfulness of the model , an independent measurement of @xmath20 was performed .",
    "a keithley 6514 electrometer was used for this purpose .",
    "the cable was again held at a constant temperature of 30 @xmath17c in a climatic chamber .",
    "when the istrument is measuring the cable parallel resistance @xmath31 with the highest sensitivity , up to 200 g@xmath1 , it uses a small current @xmath58 = 0.9 na to charge the cable , until the voltage on the cable reaches its final value @xmath59 = @xmath60 .",
    "the charge is exponential , with a time constant @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting impedance values versus time are shown in the brown curve of figure [ keithley1 ] . by fitting the curve with the exponential function @xmath62 the values 16.0 nf and 40.1 g@xmath1",
    "are obtained for @xmath63 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath63 matches the value obtained from the fit of figure [ extendedfit ] , that is 4.84 + 11.4 = 16.2 nf .",
    "the small discrepancy in the value of @xmath31 , about 10% , can be ascribed to the different environmental conditions , most likely a difference in air humidity .",
    "this measurement provides thus additional proof of the goodness of the model .",
    "since all the impedance meaurements presented so far need a large amount of time , a method was also developed to obtain a much quicker estimate of the upper limit for the cable conductance @xmath40 .",
    "the digital output of the keithley 6514 was used to control a relay , which connected a resistance @xmath64 in parallel with the cable .",
    "the value of @xmath64 was chosen as the lower compliance limit for the value of @xmath31 divided by 1000 , in this case 32 m@xmath1 . at the beginning of the measurement @xmath64",
    "was put in parallel with the cable .",
    "the range of the instrument was set to 200 m@xmath1 , so that the parallel combination of @xmath31 and @xmath64 was charged with a constant current of @xmath58 = 0.9 @xmath0a .",
    "the charge time constant is about 1/1000 than in the previous case .",
    "the resulting equivalent value for @xmath20 , computed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the impedance value given by the keithley , is shown in the first 40 seconds of the blue curve of figure [ keithley1 ] .",
    "after 40 seconds , when the voltage on the cable was almost settled on the final value , the range of the instrument was changed to 200 g@xmath1 , and the relay was opened , disconnecting @xmath64 . from this moment on , the instrument continued to charge the cable with the small current of 0.9 na , and the charge time constant was the same as for the brown curve .",
    "from the fact that the slope of the measured impedance versus time was still positive after the relay was opened , it is possible to infer that the impedance @xmath31 was larger than 32 g@xmath1 .",
    "this faster measurement method allows to give an estimate or an upper limit for @xmath40 in less than three minutes .",
    "the inadequacy of the simple basic model , composed of the parallel combination of a resistance and a capacitance to ground , in describing the parasitic impedance of a cable at low frequency was shown .",
    "a new model was presented , and its agreement with measurements on samples down to a frequency of 10 @xmath0hz was proved . while in most practical cases the simple basic model may be enough , the extended model should be adopted for a deeper understanding of the very low frequency behaviour of high impedance connecting links ."
