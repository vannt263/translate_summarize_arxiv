    "the search for a violation of the apparent , but theoretically not well founded lepton number conservation law continues at several laboratories around the world . improving the sensitivity beyond existing limits for the decays @xmath10 ( @xmath11)@xcite and @xmath12 ( @xmath13)@xcite is the goal of ongoing or planned experiments at the paul scherrer institut ( psi ) and brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl)@xcite . the observed evidence for neutrino oscillations@xcite has further stimulated the interest in this area . since extensions of the standard model like supersymmetry , leptoquarks , technicolor and other horizontal gauge boson models have been proposed which allow the possibility of flavour changing neutral currents and lepton family violating interactions , the forbidden @xmath14 decays @xmath15 ( @xmath16)@xcite and @xmath0 ( @xmath17)@xcite were also investigated .",
    "e865 was set up to search for the latter decay with improved sensitivity .    _ , width=200 ]    the e865 detector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : det ] ) resided in an unseparated 6 gev/@xmath18 beam of @xmath19 @xmath20 accompanied by about @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 per ags cycle . about",
    "8% of the @xmath20 decayed in the 5 m long decay volume .",
    "the decay products were separated by charge by a first dipole magnet and then momentum analysed by a second dipole magnet sandwiched between two pairs of proportional chambers .",
    "the wire chambers with four planes each were kept at lower voltage in the region were the beam passes .",
    "this arrangement yields a resolution of @xmath24 , where the momentum @xmath23 of the decay products ( @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) ranges between 0.6 and 3.5 gev/@xmath18 .",
    "four gas filled erenkov counters were positioned inside and after the spectrometer magnet for @xmath26 identification .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter of shashlyk type@xcite further helped to separate @xmath26 from other decay products .",
    "it consists of 600 modules , each 15 radiation lengths deep in beam direction .",
    "it is followed by an array of 12 planes of proportional tubes separated by iron plates used to discriminate pions against muons .",
    "the event trigger is based on the information from four scintillator hodoscopes , d and a before and after the spectrometer , b and c in front and in the middle of the muon stack . in the lowest trigger level three",
    "charged particles are required , each identified by a cluster in the calorimeter and a signal from the a - counter in front of it .",
    "depending on the final state the particle identification signals and topological information is added at higher levels , e.g. a @xmath1 candidate is given by an @xmath27 ( erenkov on beam left filled with h@xmath28 at atmospheric pressure ) and two particles on the beam right , one traversing the muon stack , vetoed with signals from the ch@xmath29 filled erenkov on beam right .",
    "the flexibility of the trigger and particle identification system allowed to accumulate high statistics data samples either concurrently with @xmath1 high intensity running or in dedicated runs at lower intensity on the decays @xmath30 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 for physics analysis and on @xmath31 and @xmath32 for normalisation .",
    "the report focusses on the @xmath1 results and those on other lepton flavour violating decays as well as the @xmath7 data , from which a new , quite precise value for the @xmath8-wave @xmath9 scattering length can be deduced .",
    "this quantity plays a central role in the low energy effective theory of strong interactions - chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite . both the flavour changing neutral current decays @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which will not be discussed here in detail , are known to be dominated in the standard model by long - distance effects involving one - photon exchange , and are of interest for chpt tests , too .",
    "our published results@xcite for these decays include precise branching ratios and form factor information , establish firmly the vector nature of the interaction , resolve the discrepancy of older data with @xmath35 universality , and provide evidence for the existence of a pion loop term calculated in next - to - leading order chpt .",
    "0.1 in    ._upper limits for lepton flavour number violating decays established by experiment e865@xcite : lfnv : violation of lepton flavour number conservation ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) ; lnv : violation of total lepton number conservation ( @xmath38 ) ; @xmath39 : number of quarks and leptons of generation @xmath40@xcite ; gv : violation of generation number conservation .",
    "( pdg : particle data group@xcite ) _ [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      in conclusion it can be stated , that the e865 results constitute a major advance in the program of precision tests of hadronic interaction models at low energies .",
    "they also do nicely confirm the updated two - loop chpt predictions@xcite .",
