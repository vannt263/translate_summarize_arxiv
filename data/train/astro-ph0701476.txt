    "<S> , this classification agrees with the location expected in irac - mips color - color diagrams for these objects . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the evolved disk systems are mostly a combination of objects with optically thick but non - flared disks , suggesting grain growth and/or settling , and transition disks , systems in which the inner disk is partially or fully cleared of small dust . in all , we identify 7 transition disk candidates and 3 possible debris disk systems </S>",
