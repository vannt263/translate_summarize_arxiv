    "strong interaction of metal nanosystems with light is the key element driving fundamental and applied research in plasmonics @xcite .",
    "one of the key aspects that makes surface plasmons useful for e.g. cancer therapy @xcite , sensing @xcite , solar harvesting @xcite and strong light - matter interactions @xcite is their tuneability which enables resonances from the ultraviolet @xcite to infrared @xcite .",
    "this is obtained by varying the size , geometry , materials , and arrangement of nanoparticles and their arrays @xcite .",
    "indeed , only through careful study of relationships between these parameters and the optical properties of plasmons did the previously mentioned and other applications become possible .",
    "perhaps the most important parameter determining the resonances of localized surface plasmon resonances ( lsprs ) is the nanoparticle size , a fact which can be inferred from the works of mie @xcite .",
    "however , this classical treatment of the plasmon ceases to be applicable when the particle size reaches the single nanometer size range and the lspr resonance deviates from the quasistatic prediction , either to the red or blue , depending on circumstances @xcite .",
    "the need to elucidate these observations sparked extensive experimental and theoretical research which points towards quantum size and non - local surface effects as determining factors @xcite .",
    "of the remaining parameters which dictate the behavior of lsprs the plasma frequency @xmath2 of the metal plays also a key role . derived from a fit of the drude model to experimental data , @xmath3 ranges from a few ev ( e.g. k with ca .",
    "3.8  ev ) to the teens of ev ( e.g. al with ca .",
    "12 - 15 ev depending on the data ) @xcite , yielding lspr resonances from the uv to the near - ir for spheres of the same size .",
    "the plasma frequency is a function of the carrier density which in metals is on the order of @xmath4@xmath5 @xmath6 , hence a reduction of the carrier density results in a smaller @xmath2 .",
    "for example , doped semiconductors may have relatively high concentrations of electrons / holes in the conduction / valence bands , a prerequisite for supporting surface plasmons @xcite .",
    "nanocrystals made from these materials through well controlled doping have carrier densities on the order of @xmath7 @xmath6 , a value two orders of magnitude lower than in typical metals @xcite .",
    "similar densities can also be achieved in synthesized colloidal metal oxide nanocrystals @xcite . in common metals the classical density parameter",
    "@xmath8 expressed in units of the bohr radius is 26 , while in doped semiconductors it reaches 715 .",
    "even smaller electron densities have been recently achieved by photodoping of colloidal zno quantum dots ( qds ) , with @xmath9 @xmath6 or @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "materials with such dilute carrier densities exhibit an absorption band in the infrared rather than in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum and the energy of the lsprs can be tuned by the doping level and the permittivity of the different host media in which the nanocrystal qds are synthesized .",
    "lsprs of doped semiconductors are very sensitive to changes in the electronic density",
    ". therefore they can be used for detection of electronic proceses taking place at the nanoparticle which are important for redox chemistry .",
    "different ways of creating low carrier density qds , as well as different aspects of their physical chemistry , are documented in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a better understanding and an accurate description of their optical properties is still needed to exploit potential applications of these new plasmonics systems . from a fundamental , microscopic point of view",
    ", these systems can be considered as quantum objects since the wavelength of the carriers can be of the order of the crystal size , which makes them ideal systems for investigating quantum properties .",
    "optical properties of small particles are usually studied using the classical electromagnetic theory of mie @xcite in which the electronic transport properties are described by a local ( that is independent of spatial coordinates ) dielectric function @xmath11 .",
    "in many cases @xmath11 is just the bulk dielectric function of the material even though effects of quantization due to size ( quantum size effect ",
    "qse ) have recently been included @xcite . for spheres of size in the nanometer scale ,",
    "this is done by considering a system of free and independent electrons confined by an infinite potential barrier at the surface , then solving the schrdinger equation and computing the dielectric function using the dipole approximation for the matrix elements .",
    "this approach thus concentrates on the discrete nature of the electronic states within the nanoparticle but does not take into account the effects of electron - electron interaction which are known to be important in the bulk and at the surface of the typical metals . in particular , the average potential a metal electron feels is not infinitely abrupt at the surface but rather it is a smooth function of the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the surface , which allows the metallic wave functions to leak out of the metal @xcite .",
    "this is commonly known as the spill - out effect and , being a genuine surface property , strongly influences the lsprs , both in energy and in width , of common metals not only for planar surfaces @xcite but also in nanosystems @xcite .    a second surface mechanism , namely diffuse surface scattering , which affects lsprs in any geometry originates from the existence of imperfections or roughness at a microscopic scale on the surface .",
    "diffuse surface scattering causes , on average , omnidirectional reflection of electrons which arrive at a very rough surface from the bulk .",
    "this mechanism when applied to lsprs contributes mainly to energy broadening since coherence between single scattering events is lost . at high electron densities of typical metals",
    "the spill - out effect dominates over diffuse surface scattering @xcite but , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spill - out effect decreases much more quickly with decreasing electron density than diffuse surface scattering .",
    "therefore , at low enough electron densities , surface spill - out can be effectively neglected and diffuse scattering at the particle surface becomes the key mechanism contributing to blueshift and energy broadening of the plasmonic resonances in these systems .",
    "one should notice that imperfections in the shape and morphology of ultra small particles , as well as the presence of absorbed molecules @xcite , are frequent and constitute the source of diffuse surface scattering .    in a previous publication @xcite we showed that , at ultra - low electron densities , diffuse scattering at the surface of nanospheres plays an important role in determining the resonance maximum and linewidth of lsprs .",
    "we developed a detailed theoretical model that describes diffuse surface scattering and used it in conjunction with a dielectric function containing the qse , giving results consistent with recent experimental results for photodoped zno @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to get deeper physical insight into the consequences of having diffuse scattering at the surface of low carrier density nanosystems .",
    "we identify and analyze the role that the different parameters appearing in the theory of the diffuse surface scattering effect play in giving the shape of the lsprs .",
    "a key parameter is the length @xmath0 , dependent on the density and effective mass of the charge carriers , which gives the strength of the qse when compared to the particle radius @xmath12 .",
    "the other key parameter is the velocity of the electronic excitations .",
    "we obtain the length scale for diffuse surface scattering , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 giving the strength of the effect .",
    "other important lengths emerging from our analysis are the wavelength and the damping length of the oscillations appearing in the lsprs which , in addition to the carrier density depend on other material parameters , and that can change completely the evolution of the plasmon width with size .",
    "we also quantify the relative contributions of qse and diffuse surface scattering to the blueshift of the resonances .",
    "in addition to photodoped zno , we address other low carrier density nanosystems present in the literature .",
    "the variety of behaviors we find for the lsprs could be useful for designing plasmonic systems having desired properties .",
    "a microscopic formulation of the electromagnetic properties of bounded systems requires a model for the behavior of charge carriers at the surface .",
    "this will modify the electromagnetic fields near the surface with respect to the classical form .",
    "however , for comparison with most of the experiments , one only needs these fields integrated across the surface .",
    "in particular , for the case of spheres of radius @xmath12 , when the quasi - static limit @xmath15 is valid , @xmath16 being the frequency and @xmath17 the speed of light , the optical absorption cross section can be calculated as @xmath18 , \\label{sigma - abs}\\ ] ] with the polarizability of the sphere given by @xcite @xmath19 } { \\epsilon(\\omega)+2\\epsilon_m+2\\left(\\epsilon(\\omega)-\\epsilon_m\\right ) \\frac{d_r(\\omega , r)}{r}+2 \\frac{d_{\\theta}(\\omega , r)}{r}}. \\label{alpha}\\ ] ]    in the above equations @xmath11 is the classical , local permittivity of the metal , @xmath20 is the permittivity of the medium surrounding the sphere ( assumed to be frequency independent ) and the lengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined as    @xmath23    @xmath24    respectively . in eqs .",
    "( [ dr ] ) and ( [ d - theta - def ] ) @xmath25 is the radial coordinate , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the normal to the surface component of the electric field vector @xmath28 and the parallel to the surface component of the displacement vector @xmath29 , respectively . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are their classical counterparts for a model where there is an abrupt change from @xmath11 to @xmath20 at @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath26 and @xmath27 differ from @xmath30 and @xmath31 only in the region near the surface , recovering the classical results of the mie theory if @xmath33 and @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "the lengths @xmath35 and @xmath36 when compared to the size @xmath12 give , respectively , the strength of the spill - out and diffuse surface scattering effects . this can be understood from the following argument .",
    "@xmath37 can be related to the electronic charge density , @xmath38 , induced at the surface by any external perturbation as @xmath39 notice in eq .",
    "( [ dr - rho ] ) that @xmath40 in the classical case , where the induced charge density is a @xmath41-function at @xmath32 , hence the length @xmath37 describes the spill - out effect .",
    "now consider an ideal perfectly flat surface .",
    "electron scattering at such a surface does not change the parallel component of the electron momentum and the parallel current is conserved . since @xmath42 is a continuous function across the surface , @xmath27 is not modified with respect to its classical form and @xmath34 .",
    "however , at a very rough surface ( on a microscopic scale ) an electron can , on the average , be scattered back in any direction and the parallel current is not conserved .",
    "consequently , @xmath43 .",
    "we should stress that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are complex surface response functions whose real and imaginary parts are not independent but related by kramers - kronig relations @xcite . from the structure of eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) it can be readily seen that their real parts contribute mainly to the energy shift while the imaginary parts contribute to the change in width of the plasmon resonances with particle size .",
    "then position and width of the lsprs are , in general , related magnitudes . a common simple model for describing surface scattering consists of defining an effective damping rate as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bulk relaxation time due to scattering with phonons and impurities , @xmath46 is the fermi velocity and @xmath47 is a constant of the order of unity which is usually taken as an adjustable parameter .",
    "the effective damping rate is then introduced in a drude dielectric function of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the plasma frequency , @xmath50 is the high - frequency permittivity of the material , @xmath51 is the permittivity of the free space , and @xmath52 is the effective mass of the charge carrier in units of the electron mass @xmath53 .",
    "the calculation of the absorption cross section using this drude dielectric function in the classical mie theory produces lsprs whose position is fixed at the drude value @xmath54 independent of @xmath12 and only the linewidth scales linearly with @xmath55 .",
    "this is because in this classical model the size of the system only limits the mean free path of carriers .",
    "therefore this model can only approximate true surface scattering in cases in which the mechanism slightly affects the plasmon energy , which only occurs in especial circumstances , as we will see below .    in this work",
    "we use a theory for diffuse surface scattering that was first designed for planar surfaces @xcite and then extended to spheres @xcite . as a detailed account of it",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the accompanying supplementary information , we only reproduce here the basic ingredients .",
    "the theory embeds a real sphere in an infinite , fictitious medium , both characterized by exactly the same dielectric functions .",
    "then , a constitutive relation for the polarization @xmath56 caused by free charges inside the real sphere , is written as @xmath57 \\cdot \\mathbf{e}^{m}(\\mathbf{r ' } , \\omega ) , \\label{p - general}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the electric field vector in the infinite medium , which for @xmath59 is the actual electric field inside the sphere .",
    "@xmath60 is the dielectric tensor of the medium and the integral extends to the whole space . in this",
    "integral , the region of space @xmath61 describes excitations produced at a point @xmath62 inside the sphere that propagate directly to the point @xmath63 . the fictitious region occupying @xmath64 simulates excitations which arrive at @xmath63 after having been reflected at the surface .",
    "therefore , the surface properties are mimicked by values of the electric field @xmath58 in the fictitious region of the infinite medium .",
    "we want the sphere surface to reflect electrons completely at random meaning that , on the average , no excitation originating at the surface will arrive at @xmath63 .",
    "these conditions require that an equivalent electric field @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ p - general ] ) be zero outside the sphere .",
    "hence , the problem consists of constructing an electric field of the form @xmath65 which satisfies the maxwell equations . to do so",
    ", one needs a model for the dielectric tensor , @xmath60 , of the medium .",
    "an essential requirement for a theory of diffuse surface scattering is the use of a non - local transverse dielectric function , in the same way that a non - local longitudinal dielectric function is required to describe the spill - out effect .",
    "the simplest possible form for a non - local transverse dielectric function is an analogue to the familiar hydrodynamical model for the longitudinal dielectric function . in our approximation @xmath60",
    "only depends on spatial coordinates through the difference @xmath66 , it is thus convenient to fourier - transform the permittivity to momentum space where our non - local transverse dielectric function reads @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a wave vector and @xmath1 is a constant proportional to the fermi velocity @xmath46 . here",
    ", the hydrodynamical - like dielectric function has been implemented to include qse by means of the energy gap @xmath69 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) with @xmath70 @xcite , @xmath71 being the fermi wave vector .",
    "the energy gap @xmath72 ( or the length @xmath0 ) is the first key parameter of our theory .",
    "since we can neglect spill - out effects @xcite ( low electron density materials ) , the longitudinal dielectric function of the sphere is a local one .",
    "this choice yields @xmath33 .",
    "the longitudinal and the transverse dielectric functions have to be equal in the @xmath73 limit , therefore a good approximation for @xmath74 is @xmath75    having specified the dielectric response of the medium the electromagnetic normal modes of the electronic system are known .",
    "the longitudinal modes , which are solutions of the equation @xmath76 , are absent because @xmath74 is a local dielectric function .",
    "the transverse modes are solutions of the equation @xmath77 for the model of eq .",

    "( [ t12 ] ) that , to the order @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "hence the present approximation contains the usual polariton mode propagating with wave vector @xmath88 and one transverse electron - hole pair propagating with wave vector @xmath79 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - t ] ) . then our simple form of @xmath81 substitutes the whole spectrum of electronic excitations by just a single electron - hole pair whose energy is proportional to momentum as @xmath89 , @xmath1 being the velocity of the pair .",
    "this means that an appropriate value for @xmath1 could be an average value over the whole spectrum . for large metallic systems , @xmath90 in order to fit the low frequency limit of the lindhard dielectric function even though other choices can be found in the literature .",
    "the velocity @xmath1 is the other key parameter of the theory ( @xmath0 being the first ) .",

    "however , qses appear in our theory even if we neglect diffuse surface scattering by making @xmath123 . in this case",
    "we are left with a local dielectric function of the lorentz type : @xmath124 , which blueshifts the resonance energy relative to its drude value as @xmath125 while the linewidth equals @xmath126 independent of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in our general theory with both qses and diffuse surface scattering present , the width of the lsprs is larger than @xmath126 as a consequence of the later , even though the amount of increase may be very dependent on @xmath72 for small @xmath12 .",
    "however , as both effects contribute independently to the blueshift of the lspr energy , an estimation of their relative contributions is given in the next section . at this point",

    "@xmath150 ( red lines ) , and @xmath173 ( blue lines ) . in this system the plasmon width has an oscillatory - damped behavior in the whole nanometer range of radii which is independent of the qse . ]    in the experiments of schimpf et al.@xcite the electron density was estimated to be @xmath174 @xmath6 and we used the lower limit to reproduce the experimental values of @xmath131 at large @xmath12 .",
    "however , we have checked that the behavior of the lsprs just described does not change qualitatively when changing the electronic density within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "a different pattern would have been encountered if the electronic density could have been increased by a factor of 10 , to @xmath175 @xmath6 , without changing the rest of the material parameters .",
    "we call this system low - electron - density zno in toluene for which @xmath176 , @xmath177  m s@xmath140 @xmath178  ev , @xmath179  nm , @xmath180  nm , and @xmath181  nm .     for the same values of the parameters as in figure [ fig - width - n10 ] .",
    "( b ) the relative blueshift in energy of the lsprs of low - electron - density zno spheres as a function of @xmath154 ( solid lines ) is obtained as the sum of the contribution of qse ( blue line ) and the contribution of diffuse surface scattering ( dashed lines ) . @xmath165 and two values of @xmath1 , @xmath151 ( red lines ) , @xmath172 ( black lines ) . even though the relative blueshift is smaller than for ultralow - electron - density zno , both effects contribute nearly the same also in this case .",
    "the saw - tooth oscillations of the diffuse scattering contribution can change the sign of the energy shift from blue to red . ]",
    "figure  [ fig - width - n10 ] shows @xmath132 of low - electron - density zno as function of @xmath154 for several values of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "two differences with the previous case are noticeable .",
    "first , the decrease in @xmath182 causes that qses do not impact diffuse surface scattering .",
    "therefore they are actually independent effects and the respective contributions can be added .",
    "second , the oscillatory - damped behavior of @xmath100 occurs in the whole nanometer range of @xmath12 and the oscillations are less damped as a consequence of having a smaller wave length and a larger damping length than in the experimental ultralow - electron - density system .",
    "the wave length of the oscillations is @xmath183  nm and the effect could be detected in samples with a dispersion in sizes smaller than 1 nm , which seems experimentally feasible . the rescaling of @xmath12 with @xmath1 in the whole range of radii is also apparent in the figure . figure  [ fig - wdiff - n10]a shows @xmath184 for the same values of the parameters as in figure  [ fig - width - n10 ] .",
    "it reveals a saw - tooth - damped behavior and also the rescaling of @xmath12 with @xmath1 .",
    "notice that the contribution of diffuse surface scattering to the energy shift at short radii is smaller than the one shown in figure  [ fig - wdiff]a because the value of @xmath185 is smaller than for ultralow - electron - density zno .",
    "the relative contributions of qse and diffuse surface scattering to the energy shift of the lsprs are displayed in figure  [ fig - wdiff - n10]b .",
    "even tough the total relative energy shift is not so large as for ultralow - electron - density zno ( figure  [ fig - wdiff]b ) , because of the smaller values of both @xmath185 and @xmath182 , the contributions of both effects can be similar also in this case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the oscillations caused by diffuse surface scattering can change the sign of the energy shift from blue to red .",
    "s as a function of @xmath154 for @xmath151 and two values of @xmath0 , @xmath149 ( dashed line ) and @xmath165 ( continuous line ) .",
    "the plasmon width has a linear scaling with @xmath154 up to @xmath186 nm@xmath140 , and , correspondingly , the plasmon energy only increases slightly in this case .",
    "due to the small value of @xmath187 , qse are small in the nanometer range of radii . ]",
    "we finally analyze the case of cu@xmath188s qds doped to hole densities on the order of @xmath189 @xmath6 dispersed in tetrachloroethylene ( tce ) , one of the systems where lsprs arising in low carrier density nanocrystals were earlier reported @xcite .",
    "the values of the parameters are @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 .",
    "we chose @xmath1360.17 ev in order to approximately reproduce the width of the @xmath193 nm crystal of @xcite . using @xmath194 @xmath6",
    ", we obtain @xmath176 , @xmath195 m s@xmath140 , @xmath196  ev , @xmath197  nm , @xmath198  nm , and @xmath199  nm . notice that @xmath182 is smaller by a factor of 0.5 and @xmath185 is smaller by a factor of 0.3 than the corresponding values for our previous system , both systems having equal carrier densities .",
    "consequently , we expect smaller effects of qse and diffuse surface scattering for cu@xmath188s in tce than for low - electron density zno in toluene . figure  [ fig - cus]a , b shows , respectively , the width and the energy of the lsprs for @xmath12 in the nanometer range and @xmath151 , neglecting qses ( @xmath149 ) , and including the qses with @xmath165 .",
    "what happens in this system is that the large value of the bulk damping @xmath126 , a factor of 1.7 larger than for photodoped zno , with nearly equal fermi velocities , makes the damping length of the oscillations to be short .",
    "we therefore find a large range of values of @xmath12 where the width scales linearly with @xmath154 and , correspondingly , a very small energy shift is found at these radii . compared to our previous system , we notice that the width of the resonances increases with respect to @xmath126 by a factor of 1.5 at most while factors of 3 were found in figure  [ fig - width - n10 ] for @xmath151 . moreover , as seen in figure  [ fig - cus]b , the small value of @xmath200 in this system also makes qses to be small and , consequently , the energy of the lsprs increases by 8@xmath145 while it is 30@xmath145 for the case of low - electron density zno with the same ratio of @xmath201 and @xmath202 , shown in figure  [ fig - wdiff - n10]b .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the role that effects of quantization due to size and diffuse surface scattering play in modifying the lsprs of low - density carrier nanospheres as a function of size , using the theory expounded in detail in ref .",
    "the two key parameters of the theory are the length @xmath0 giving the strength of the qses and the velocity @xmath1 of the electronic excitations , entering in the length scale for diffuse surface scattering @xmath203 . while in our theory",
    "the qse itself only produces a blueshift in energy of the lsprs with particle size , the diffuse surface scattering mechanism gives to both energy and linewidth an oscillatory - damped behavior with characteristics lengths that depend on the carrier density and on other material parameters as well .",
    "thus , the evolution of the lsprs with particle size at the nanometer scale is very dependent on the relation of size to these lengths , which we illustrated with several examples .",
    "our calculations for the energy shift of the resonances ( relative to the drude value ) showed a critical dependence on these lengths as we obtained 80@xmath145 blueshift for ultralow electron density zno spheres in toluene and 8@xmath145 blueshift for cu@xmath188s spheres of the same radii in tce .",
    "significant differences in the magnitude of the plasmon width ( relative to the bulk value ) are also found among the investigated systems . the variety of behaviors we found for the lsprs could be useful for designing plasmonic devices based on doped semiconductor nano structures having desired properties .",
