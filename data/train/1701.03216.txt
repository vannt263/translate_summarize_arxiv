    "in the field of parallel and distributed systems , interconnection networks are an important research area . typically , the topology of a network can be represented as a graph in which the vertices represent processors and the edges represent communication links .    for graph definitions and notations ,",

    "a graph @xmath4 is called bipartite if its vertex set can be partitioned into two parts @xmath7 such that every edge has one endpoint in @xmath8 and one in @xmath9 . a vertex @xmath10 is a neighbor of @xmath11 if @xmath12 is an edge of @xmath4 , and @xmath13 denotes all the neighbors of @xmath11 in @xmath4 .",

    "a bipartite graph is hamiltonian laceable if there is a hamiltonian path between any two vertices in different bipartite sets .",
    "the hamiltonian property is one of the major requirements in designing network topologies since a topology structure containing hamiltonian paths or cycles can efficiently simulate many algorithms that are designed on linear arrays or rings @xcite .",
    "it is important to consider fault - tolerance in networks since faults may occur in real networks .",
    "two fault models have been studied in many well - known networks , one is the random fault model , which means that faults may occur anywhere without any restriction , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the other is the conditional fault model , which assumes that the fault distribution is limited .",
    "for example , some studies on two or more non - faulty edges incident to each vertex can be found in @xcite .",
