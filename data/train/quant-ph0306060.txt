    "it is known that the kronig - penney multibarrier system @xcite which is arranged along the whole spatial region is characterized by an energy spectrum which is composed of continuous bands separated by forbidden gaps @xcite .",
    "the larger are the values of the energies the shorter these gaps become until they entirely disappear for large enough energies @xcite .",
    "it is also known @xcite that the gaps in the energy spectrum of the infinite kronig - penney system are related @xcite to the eigenvalues @xmath2 of the characteristic equation which is associated with the two dimensional transfer matrix that relates the transmission and reflection coefficients of any two neighbouring barriers . the limits ( @xmath3 )",
    "are taken when the related potential barriers are separated from each other by a very large number @xmath4 of other similar barriers .",
    "thus , if either of these limits becomes very large , in which case the resulting wave function does not remain finite , the corresponding energies are disallowed @xcite and these constitute the gaps of the energy spectrum .",
    "the former problems which are associated with the infinite kronig - penney system do not arise in the bounded multibarrier system discussed here .",
    "this is because although the number of barriers is very large , as for the kronig - penney system , nevertheless the finite extent of the system enables one to analytically express in explicit form @xcite the total transfer matrix that relates the two barriers at the two extreme sides of the system .",
    "thus , the characteristic equation and the corresponding eigenvalues of this overall transfer matrix have also been found @xcite in exact closed forms . from the latter one",
    "may construct the appropriate energy spectrum for both cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy and @xmath8 the constant height of all the barriers .    an important parameter which will be constantly referred to in this work",
    "is related to the mentioned eigenvalues @xmath2 and is the variable over which the energy @xmath7 is plotted ( see , for example , figure 6.6 in @xcite and the seven figures here ) .",
    "this parameter is denoted @xmath9 here and is defined by the first of the following eqs ( [ e8 ] ) ( see also eqs ( [ e9])-([e10 ] ) ) .",
    "we show in the following that there are no allowed energies that correspond to certain values of the total length @xmath0 of the system and the ratio @xmath1 of its total interval to total width .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the kronig - penney system in which the gaps in the energy spectrum disappear @xcite for either large values of the energy @xmath7 or ( and ) large values of the parameter @xmath9 @xcite the case here is different .",
    "this is because , as will be shown in sections 3 - 4 , the gaps in the energy spectrum of the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier system do not disappear for certain values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 even for large @xmath7 or ( and ) large @xmath9 .",
    "we also show that the energy @xmath7 depends upon the total length @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath1 in such a manner that its form , as function of @xmath9 , is quasi - periodic for small @xmath1 and large ( or intermediate ) values of @xmath0 and is proportional to @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "it will also be shown that the energy spectrum is discontinuous at many of its points even at the parts at which it has no gaps at all .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the terminology and terms @xcite that describe the bounded multibarrier potential . in section 3",
    "we discuss the energy spectrum for the @xmath5 case and find the values of the parameter @xmath9 for which no corresponding energies are found .",
    "that is , we find the band - gap structure of it .",
    "we also show the remarked discontinuity in @xmath7 as function of @xmath9 . in section 4",
    "we repeat the whole process for the @xmath6 case and summarize in table 1 the allowed energies for both cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in section 5",
    "we show that the occurence of stable gaps in its energy spectrum together with other previously shown @xcite properties of it , imply that the bounded multibarrier potential is a singular system @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in section 6 .",
    "we consider a bounded one - dimensional system of @xmath11 barriers assumed to have the same height @xmath8 for all of them and to be uniformly arrayed between the point @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the total length of the system is @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the total width of all the @xmath11 barriers ( where the potential @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 is the total sum of all the intervals between neighbouring barriers ( where @xmath18 ) .",
    "that is , in a system of @xmath11 barriers the width of each one is @xmath19 , and the interval between each two neighbours is @xmath20 . writing @xmath17 as @xmath21 , where @xmath1 is a real number",
    ", we can express @xmath15 and @xmath17 in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xcite @xmath22 we consider the passage of a plane wave through this system , which has the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "matching boundary conditions at the beginning and end of each barrier , we may construct a solution in terms of the transfer matrix @xcite @xmath25 on the @xmath26-th barrier .",
    "thus , using the terminology in @xcite , we obtain after the @xmath4-th barrier the following transfer matrices equation @xcite @xmath27 = p^{(n)}p^{(n-1)}\\ldots p^{(2)}p^{(1 ) } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_0\\\\ b_0 \\end{array } \\right]=\\cal p   \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_0\\\\ b_0 \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected parts @xcite respectively of the wave function at the @xmath4-th barrier .",
    "@xmath30 is the coefficient of the initial wave that approaches the potential barrier system , and @xmath31 is the coefficient of the reflected wave from the first barrier .",
    "@xmath32 is the total transfer matrix over the system of @xmath4 barriers and is given for the @xmath5 case in the limit of very large @xmath4 by @xcite @xmath33\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are expressed as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xcite @xmath43 it is shown @xcite that @xmath32 is given for the @xmath6 case and in the same limit of very large @xmath4 by @xmath44,\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are now @xmath48 @xmath39 is the same as for the @xmath5 case and @xmath49 . in the numerical part of this work",
    "we follow the convention in the literature that assigns to @xmath50 and @xmath51 the values of 1 and @xmath52 respectively . defining , as in @xcite , the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath53 @xmath54 one",
    "may obtain the eigenvalues of either the matrix of eq ( [ e3 ] ) for the @xmath5 case or of the matrix ( [ e6 ] ) for @xmath6 in the form @xmath55 the eigenvalues of the @xmath5 case are obtained by substituting the @xmath37 and @xmath34 from eq ( [ e4 ] ) and those of the @xmath6 case by substituting the corresponding quantities from eq ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "we , now , show that , unlike the infinite kronig - penney system @xcite that have no finite total length @xmath0 and no finite ratio @xmath1 , the energy spectrum of the bounded multibarrier potential depends critically upon @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we first take the real components of both sides of the first of eqs ( [ e8 ] ) and divide the numerator and denominator of its right hand side by @xmath56 @xmath57 we note that the last equation is valid for both cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 except that one should substitute the appropriate @xmath34 and @xmath37 from eq ( [ e4 ] ) for the @xmath5 case ( as we do in next section ) or @xmath45 and @xmath47 from eq ( [ e7 ] ) for @xmath6 as done in section 4 .",
    "we , now , consider the @xmath5 case and substitute in eq ( [ e10 ] ) the appropriate @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 from eqs ( [ e4 ] ) and ( [ e5 ] ) to obtain @xmath58 the last result was obtained by expressing @xmath15 and @xmath17 in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 according to eq ( [ e1 ] ) . squaring both sides of the last equation one obtains @xmath59 from eq ( [ e12 ] )",
    "we see that for all values of @xmath9 that cause @xmath60 on its left hand side to vanish one must have corresponding values of @xmath61 that cause @xmath62 on its right hand side to become very large .",
    "that is , for @xmath63 , @xmath64 one must have @xmath65 , @xmath64 .",
    "note that since @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 are positive the expression @xmath61 for the @xmath5 case is positive .",
    "thus , the appropriate values of the energies @xmath7 that correspond to the remarked values of @xmath9 are @xmath66 .",
    "that is , from the last expression for @xmath7 and from the condition @xmath5 we find that there are allowed energies only for those values of the total length @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath1 that satisfy the inequality @xmath67 that is , the energies that correspond to @xmath63 , @xmath64 depend upon the total length @xmath0 of the system and the ratio @xmath1 of its total interval to total width . for all other values of @xmath9",
    "we may take the reciprocals of both sides of eq ( [ e12 ] ) and subtract 1 from the resulting expressions to obtain @xmath68 we note that exactly the same equations as those of ( [ e12 ] ) and ( [ e14 ] ) are obtained also for the @xmath6 case except that we use , as remarked , the @xmath45 and @xmath47 from eqs ( [ e7 ] ) with @xmath49 ( where , for numerical purposes , we assign , as noted , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ) . from eq ( [ e14 ] )",
    "we may find the energies which correspond to the values of @xmath9 that cause @xmath71 on its left hand side to vanish .",
    "these @xmath9 s are @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 ) so using eq ( [ e14 ] ) and the positiveness of @xmath61 we have @xmath74 from which one obtains @xmath75 . from the last expression for @xmath7 and from @xmath5 we find that there are allowed energies that correspond to @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 ) only for those values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 that satisfy @xmath76 that is , as for the case of the inequality ( [ e13 ] ) , the energies that correspond to @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 ) depend upon the total length @xmath0 of the system and the ratio @xmath1 of its total interval to total width . note that although @xmath77 corresponds also to the former values of @xmath9 that result in @xmath78 there is no value of the energy @xmath7 , for the @xmath5 case , that corresponds to @xmath77 .",
    "this is because from @xmath77 one obtains @xmath79 which , for positive @xmath1 , does not conform to @xmath5 .",
    "now , as may be seen from eq ( [ e14 ] ) , the dependence of the allowed energies upon @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 is not restricted only to these values of @xmath7 that correspond to @xmath63 or to @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 ) . moreover , as will be shown in the following , the form of the allowed energy , as function of @xmath9 , depends in a peculiar manner upon the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "that is , if @xmath1 is small , say @xmath80 , then the expression that multiplies @xmath62 on the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) is larger than unity and the solution of it for the allowed energy @xmath7 as function of @xmath9 can be obtained only numerically . in such case",
    "we find , as shown in the following , that these @xmath7 s change periodically with @xmath9 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath81 then the expression that multiply @xmath62 on the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) is very close to unity .",
    "for example , for @xmath82 and @xmath83 this expression equals @xmath84 and it tends fastly to unity for values of @xmath10 or@xmath85and @xmath5 .",
    "thus , for @xmath10 we may safely approximate eq ( [ e14 ] ) as @xmath86 from which we obtain @xmath87 .",
    "the last equation results in @xmath88 ,  @xmath64 from which we have @xmath89 as seen from eq ( [ e17 ] ) not all values of @xmath90 are suitable for the @xmath5 case but only those that satisfy @xmath91 .",
    "for example , for @xmath92 and @xmath82 the permissible values of @xmath90 that have corresponding energies are only those that satisfy @xmath93 .    for other values of @xmath1 from the range @xmath94 the expression that multiplies @xmath62 on the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] )",
    "is , as remarked , larger than unity for the @xmath5 case and one must resort to numerical methods for solving eq ( [ e14 ] ) for @xmath7 as function of @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the obtained energies are _ quasi - periodic _ where the character and form of the quasi - period depend upon the total length @xmath0 of the system and the ratio @xmath1 of its total interval to total width .",
    "we have emphasized the word quasiperiod since as one may realize from a close scrutiny of the appended figures the forms of the energy as functions of @xmath9 are not exactly repeated over the @xmath9 axis but differ in the small details .",
    "it is also shown for both cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 that the quasi - periodic character of the energy as function of @xmath9 emerges only for values of @xmath7 that are close to the potential @xmath8 ( close from below for the @xmath6 case and from above for @xmath5 ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath5 and @xmath95 the corresponding energy is found to vary in almost periodic manner only between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this is because for higher values of @xmath7 the expression that multiplies the _ tangent _ function on the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) tends to unity even for very small values of @xmath1 . in such case",
    "the situation is the same as that formerly found for large @xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) where the appropriate equation to use is ( [ e16 ] ) which leads to the linear expression ( [ e17 ] ) for the energy as function of @xmath9 . for values of @xmath7 that are close to the potential @xmath8 one",
    "may obtain not only the remarked quasi - periodic forms of the energy as function of @xmath9 but for very small @xmath1 the allowed energies become constant as demonstrated by the horizontal lines in figures 1 - 2 .",
    "this is because for @xmath98 and @xmath99 the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) becomes the indeterminate form @xmath100 , so using lhospital theorem @xcite we obtain for it the value of 1 . in such case",
    "the value of @xmath83 does not change with @xmath9 .",
    "the quasi - periodic nature of the energy as function of @xmath9 is demonstrated for small @xmath1 in the form of half squares as seen from figure 1 which shows nine different curves of @xmath7 from eq ( [ e14 ] ) as function of @xmath9 .",
    "all the nine curves are drawn for the same values of @xmath95 and @xmath101 but for 9 different values of the ratio @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "the different graphs in this figure and in figures 2 - 3 correspond to the values of @xmath1 in a such a manner that the curves with the most pronounced half squares , which are shown at the upper part of these figures , fit the lower values of @xmath1 .",
    "the curves which are characterized by a short and flat half squares , which are generally located at the lower parts of these figures , correspond to the higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "the horizontal lines at the bottom of figures 1 and 2 correspond , as remarked , to the constant value of the energy @xmath83 .",
    "the remarked correspondence between the graphs of @xmath7 and the appropriate @xmath1 s , by which the graphs at the upper part of the figure fit the lower @xmath1 s and those at the lower part of it fit the higher @xmath1 s , applies also for the @xmath6 case in figures 4 - 6 .    as seen from figure 1",
    "any two neighbouring half squares are connected to each other by short horizontal lines where the energy is clearly discontinuous at the connecting points .",
    "that is , at these points the energy jumps in a discontinuous manner to form the squared parts where the smaller is @xmath1 the larger are the corresponding jumps as may be seen at the higher part of the figure . for growing @xmath1 the jumps",
    "become smaller and the corresponding half squares shorter as seen at the lower part of figure 1 .",
    "one may also realize that for the large value of @xmath0 used in this figure the 9 different curves are shown mixed inside each other between the two values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 . plotting the energies @xmath7 as functions of @xmath9 for additional larger values of @xmath1 , while keeping the same @xmath0 as before , add more periodic forms ( not shown ) that are arrayed inside the formers between the same two limits of figure 1 .",
    "we must note that taking into account the periodic character of the _ tangent _ function we can rewrite eq ( [ e14 ] ) in its most general form as @xmath106 where @xmath107 . since the parameter @xmath0 occurs only under the _ tangent _ function at the right hand side of eq ( [ e18 ] )",
    "we may numerically solve it for @xmath7 and find the same quasi - periodic dependence upon @xmath9 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , figure 4 , which was drawn for @xmath108 may be obtained in almost the same form also for @xmath109 .",
    "figures 1 - 6 of this work are obtained from the equivalent equation ( [ e14 ] ) in which @xmath110 .",
    "note that for very small @xmath0 one may approximate the _ tangent _ function at the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) by @xmath61 and numerically solves the resulting equation for @xmath7 as function of @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum obtained is shown in figure 3 for the @xmath5 case and in figures 6 - 7 for @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases the different curves begin to be separated from each other and to occupy different sections of the ordinate axis .",
    "this is shown in figures 2 and 3 which are drawn under exactly the same conditions and for the same values of @xmath8 and @xmath1 as in figure 1 except that now @xmath0 assumes the values of @xmath111 for the curves of figure 2 and @xmath112 for those of figure 3 .",
    "the highest half squares of figure 2 are drawn around the value of @xmath113 and those of figure 3 around @xmath114 .",
    "note that the half squares of figure 2 are each connected to the horizontal linear sections at more than two points ( compare with figure 1 ) .",
    "this is especially demonstrated in the curves at the higher part of figure 2 which correspond to the smaller values of @xmath1 .",
    "also , as in figure 1 the discontinuous jumps in the energy are larger for the curves that correspond to small @xmath1 s at the upper part of figure 2 and smaller for the larger @xmath1 s at the lower part of it .",
    "the almost periodic curves of figure 3 which are all drawn for the value of @xmath112 are seen to be rather curved than squared and the points at which the energy jumps to form the pronounced parts of it are two for each quasi - period as in figure 1 .",
    "also , the larger is the value of @xmath1 at the lower part of figure 3 the smaller become the corresponding jumps of @xmath7 .     from eq ( [ e14 ] ) as function of @xmath9 , are all drawn for the same values of @xmath95 and @xmath101 and for nine different values of the ratio @xmath115 .",
    "the curves that have pronounced half squares at the higher part of the figure fit the lower values of @xmath1 and those that have short and flat half squares at the lower part belong to the higher @xmath1 s .",
    "the horizontal line at the bottom corresponds to the constant value of the energy obtained at @xmath83 .",
    "each quasi - periodic half square is connected at its two sides by short horizontal linear sections .",
    "one may clearly see that the energy is discontinuous and undifferentiable at the vertical sides of each half square . ]     from eq ( [ e14 ] ) as function of @xmath9 , are drawn under exactly the same conditions as those of figure 1 except that now @xmath111 .",
    "one may see that the graphs are now separated from each other , especially those at the higher part of the figure which are clearly detached from the lower three graphs .",
    "note that each half square , especially at the higher part of the figure , is discontinuous at several points and not only at its two sides ( compare with figure 1 ) .",
    "the horizontal line at the bottom corresponds to the constant value @xmath83 . ]     as function of @xmath9 , the total length @xmath0 is further decreased for all the graphs to @xmath112 .",
    "the values of @xmath8 and @xmath1 remain as in figures 1 - 2 .",
    "note that this additional decrease of @xmath0 causes the almost periodic half squares to be narrower , more curved and arranged separately from each other compared to figures 1 - 2 . ]",
    "we , now , discuss the @xmath6 case and begin from eq ( [ e12 ] ) which is valid , as remarked , also for this case .",
    "we first find the allowed energies which correspond to the values of @xmath9 that cause the left hand side of eq ( [ e12 ] ) to vanish , that is , to @xmath63 , @xmath64 . as for the @xmath5 case these energies are @xmath116 but now we consider also the @xmath7 s which correspond to negative values of @xmath9 so long as this does not cause the energies to become negative . that is , considering the negative values of @xmath9 we obtain from the last inline equation for @xmath7 and from @xmath117 that @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath8 should be related by the inequality @xmath118 in which case @xmath0 could not be very small .",
    "thus , taking into account both positive and negative values of @xmath9 and the condition @xmath6 we see that there exist allowed energies only for those values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which satisfy @xmath119 in order to satisfy the last inequality for the case in which the minus sign at the left hand side is considered the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath8 must also be related , as remarked , by @xmath118 .",
    "comparing inequality ( [ e19 ] ) with that of ( [ e13 ] ) we see , as for the @xmath5 case , that the allowed energies which correspond to @xmath63 , @xmath64 critically depend upon the values of the total length @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath1 . note",
    "that whereas in the @xmath5 case there are no allowed energies for the very large values of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( or both , see inequality ( [ e13 ] ) ) , here , when considering the plus sign at the left hand side of ( [ e19 ] ) , we find no such allowed energies for the very small values of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( or both ) .",
    "we , now , find the allowed energies that correspond to the values of @xmath9 that cause the left hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) to vanish , that is , to @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "these energies are found , as for the @xmath5 case , from @xmath120 and are @xmath121 . using the former discussion at the beginning of this section",
    "we conclude that we may consider also negative @xmath9 s so long as @xmath122 in which case @xmath0 could not be very small .",
    "thus , considering both positive and negative values of @xmath9 and the @xmath6 condition we find that there are allowed energies that correspond to @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 ) only for @xmath0 and @xmath1 which satisfy @xmath123 in order to satisfy the last inequality for the case in which the minus sign at its left hand side is considered the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath8 must be related also by @xmath122 .",
    "comparing inequality ( [ e20 ] ) with that of ( [ e15 ] ) , which refers to the @xmath5 case , we find a result analogous to that formerly found from comparing the inequalities ( [ e13 ] ) and ( [ e19 ] ) .",
    "that is , considering the plus sign at the left hand side of ( [ e20 ] ) , one may realize that for very small values of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 or both of them there are no allowed energies that correspond to @xmath124 .",
    "this is to be compared to the corresponding @xmath5 case and the inequality ( [ e15 ] ) from which one finds that there are no allowed energies for the very large values of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 or both of them .",
    "as realized from eq ( [ e14 ] ) , which is valid also for the @xmath6 case , the dependence of the allowed energies upon @xmath0 and @xmath1 is not restricted only to these values that correspond to @xmath63 or to @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "thus , one may find also the energies that correspond to other values of @xmath9 but in this case we have first to exclude those values of @xmath7 that cause the expression that multiply @xmath62 on the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) to become negative .",
    "otherwise , the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) would be negative whereas its left hand side is positive .",
    "thus , the allowed energies are those that satisfy @xmath125 the last inequality results in @xmath126 from which one may conclude that the allowed energies of the bounded multibarrier system for the @xmath6 case should be only those which satisfy the inequality @xmath127 thus , the energies that correspond to @xmath128 and @xmath129 should belong to the range @xmath130 which means that for very small values of @xmath1 there are no allowed values of @xmath7 at all . for not very small @xmath1",
    "the energies are found by discussing , as in the @xmath5 case , the two cases of large and small @xmath1 .",
    "that is , for values of @xmath7 that are close to @xmath8 ( but always @xmath6 ) the expression which multiplies @xmath62 on the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) tends to unity for @xmath10 . in such case",
    "we may use , as in the @xmath5 case , the simpler eq ( [ e16 ] ) which results with the expression ( [ e17 ] ) for the allowed energies .",
    "but now since , as remarked , @xmath7 satisfies @xmath130 there are corresponding energies only for @xmath131 , ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus , using eq ( [ e17 ] ) , which is valid also for the @xmath6 case , we find that the energies which correspond to @xmath10 and which are close from below to @xmath8 are allowed only for @xmath9 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath8 that are related by @xmath133 for values of @xmath1 from the range @xmath80 and for energies that are not close to @xmath8 we use the full equation ( [ e14 ] ) which necessitates numerical methods for solving it for @xmath7 as function of @xmath9 .",
    "it is found , as in the @xmath5 case , that the required energies are either quasi - periodic or constant .",
    "the constant energies are demonstrated by horizontal lines and appear when @xmath7 assumes the value of @xmath134 . in this case",
    "the right hand side of eq ( [ e14 ] ) assumes the indeterminate form @xmath100 so using lhospital theorem @xcite it becomes unity for all values of @xmath9 .",
    "the analogous cases discussed in the former section for @xmath5 have resulted in finding constant horizontal lines for @xmath98 .",
    "each of the following three figures 4 - 6 shows 14 different graphs of the energy @xmath7 as function of @xmath9 for the same value of @xmath135 and for @xmath136 . as for figures 1 - 3",
    "the 14 curves in each figure of the set 4 - 6 fit the 14 values of @xmath1 in an inverted order .",
    "that is , the highest value of @xmath1 fits the lowest curve in each figure and the second value of @xmath1 from above corresponds to the second curve from below in each figure and so forth .",
    "the 14 graphs of figure 4 are all drawn for the value of @xmath108 and one may see how the energy , in the form of half squares , changes almost periodically with @xmath9 . as for the @xmath137 case",
    "the forms of the energy are not exactly periodic along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "one may also realize that the most pronounced half squares are obtained for the smallest value assumed here for @xmath1 ( @xmath138 ) .",

    "as seen , the allowed energies are represented by the vertical lines between @xmath143 and @xmath144 where the thick lines signify that several lines are identical and are drawn tangent to each other .",

    "thus , one may conclude that for certain values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 there are no corresponding energies as discussed in details in sections 3 and 4 . also , there are no energies , especially , in the limits of very small @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( or both ) for the @xmath6 case and in the limits of very large @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( or both ) for the @xmath5 case .",

    "we have seen in the former sections 3 - 4 that the bounded multibarrier potential have gaps associated with its energy spectrum which depend upon the total length @xmath0 of the system and the ratio @xmath1 of its total interval to total width .",
    "we also show that , unlike the band - gap structure of the infinite kronig - penney system @xcite in which the gaps disappear for large values of the energy , the remarked dependence here of the energy spectrum upon @xmath0 and @xmath1 implied that for certain values of them the gaps do not disappear .",
    "this has been shown for the @xmath5 case in section 3 and especially for @xmath6 in section 4 where we see that there are no energies that satisfy @xmath150 ( see inequality ( [ e23 ] ) and also figure 7 from which we realize that there exist quasi - periodic gaps for small values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "now , it is accepted in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) that if the energy spectrum of any system have gaps which do not diminish for either large values of the energy @xmath7 or large @xmath9 then the relevant system is considered singular .",
    "we have shown in sections 3 - 4 that not only the energy spectrum of the bounded multibarrier potential have gaps which remain constant along the @xmath9 axis but that even for the parts of the epectrum which have bands there are points at which the energy , as function of @xmath9 , is discontinuous .",
    "these points are shown , for both cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to be associated with large @xmath0 and small @xmath1 as seen in the higher parts of figures 1 - 2 and 4 - 5 . only at small @xmath0",
    "one may obtain energies that change continuously with @xmath9 and do not jump in a discontinuous manner ( see figures 3 and 6 ) .",
    "thus , the existence of the points at which the energy changes discontinuously with @xmath9 together with the remarked nonvanishing gaps demonstrate that the bounded multibarrier potential is singular .",
    "this may be corroborated by a previously obtained result @xcite which shows that the transmission probability of the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier is unity .",
    "that is , the incoming wave function remains the same ( preserved ) after passing the dense array of potential barriers @xcite .",
    "thus , the three properties which are characterized in the literature @xcite as signs of singular systems are all found also in the bounded multibarrier potential discussed here .",
    "these properties are : ( 1 ) nonvanishing gaps , ( 2 ) the ability to pass all the barriers of the system and ( 3 ) zero range potential for each barrier which arises here from the fact that the bounded spatial length contains very large number of barriers .",
    "thus , we conclude that the dense array of potential barriers is also singular .",
    "a singular behaviour of the energy spectrum is demonstrated also in what is termed the singular point interaction @xmath151 which is characterized by a periodic array of identical short - range perturbations @xcite like our system .",
    "the allowed bands resulting from this @xmath151 interaction are characterized @xcite by an increasing , as @xmath7 grows , of the gap to band ratio .",
    "the difference between the periodic singular interaction @xmath151 and our system is that the length of the former is infinite @xcite , whereas our system is bounded .",
    "we note that infinite spatial length is also what characterizes many examples of singular systems discussed in @xcite , so the physical interpretation of the _ singular continuity _ of these systems ( see @xcite ) is connected to their infinity .",
    "that is , as written in @xcite _ `` the particle will be transmitted at least once through each barrier and then it will return again to the initial point from which it has started''_. thus , for these infinite systems the singular continuity is characterized by complete reflection that follows a former stage during which all the barriers are transmitted .",
    "this is so for the infinite systems in which no kind of transmission is possible at all , but since the bounded system admits transmission then the particle after passing all barriers finds itself outside the system at the other side of it and not at its initial side .",
    "thus , what characterizes its singularity is _ complete transmission after the particle has been transmitted through each barrier_. this was clearly shown @xcite , using transfer matrix methods @xcite , for the bounded system discussed here .",
    "we , now , show this again by using the same analytical methods applied in @xcite for showing complete reflection of the @xmath151 system .",
    "that is , taking into account the properties of the bounded multibarrier system and incorporating them into the formalism of @xcite we show that one obtains complete transmission instead of complete reflection .",
    "the single change we introduce into the formalism in @xcite is that of having to take into account that there exists only one kind of interaction in the bounded multibarrier potential compared to the multi - channels @xcite version of the @xmath151 interaction discussed in @xcite .",
    "that is , this @xmath151 interaction is characterized as being composed from all possible kinds of interactions ( elastic , inelastic etc ) .",
    "thus , the physical system used in @xcite is an infinite sequence of onionlike @xmath11 channels scatterers , so that the reflection amplitude from any such scatterer is given in @xcite by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the length of each scatterer @xcite and @xmath154 .",
    "the total reflection character of this system is demonstrated @xcite when the length @xmath153 tends to zero and the number @xmath11 of channels ( different interactions ) in each scatterer becomes very much large . in these limits",
    "one may write @xcite @xmath155 and the unity term in eq ( [ e25 ] ) may be discarded compared to @xmath156 .",
    "thus , denoting , as in @xcite , the product @xmath157 by @xmath158 the reflection amplitude from equation ( [ e25 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath159 .",
    "when , as in @xcite , @xmath160 ( and still @xmath161 ) , the product @xmath162 satisfies , due to the large @xmath11 , @xmath163 and the reflection amplitude tends to -1 so that the reflection probability @xmath164 becomes @xmath165 .",
    "now , taking into account that for the single - channel multibarrier potential discussed here @xmath11 is unity we trivially obtain , when substituting @xmath166 in eq ( [ e25 ] ) , @xmath167 .",
    "thus , from the relation between the transmission @xmath168 and the reflection @xmath169",
    "@xcite @xmath170 we learn that @xmath171 as obtained from the transfer matrix method in @xcite .",
    "we show in the appendix that if the total length of the system is bounded then even if the interaction is of the multi - channel type , as in the @xmath151 interaction , one obtains zero value for the reflection @xmath169 provided the number of barriers @xmath4 is much larger than the number @xmath11 of channels .",
    "that is , if the total length @xmath0 satisfies @xmath172 and if @xmath173 then @xmath174 which means that @xmath175 .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that if the total length of the system is finite then the singular character of the bounded dense array of either single or multi - channel scatterers is affected through the complete transmission it demonstrates .",
    "we have found the allowed energies of the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential for both cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these allowed energies critically depend upon the values of the total length @xmath0 of the system and the ratio @xmath1 of its total interval to total width .",
    "thus , it has been shown that there are values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for which there are no allowed energies .",
    "for example , it has been demonstrated in section 4 for the @xmath6 case that the allowed energies are only those from the range @xmath130 .",
    "that is , for very small values of @xmath1 there exist no energy for the bounded multibarrier system ( see also the constant gaps in figure 7 ) .",
    "it has , also , been shown for both cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 that for small @xmath1 and large ( or intermediate ) values of @xmath0 the energy @xmath7 have the form of quasi - periodic half squares which are connected to each other by horizontal lines .",
    "the points of connection of these half squares , as may be seen from the figures , are points of discontinuity at which the energy can not be differentiated . for small values of @xmath0",
    "these squared parts become shorter , narrower and more curved ( see figures 3 and 6 ) until they disappear for small enough @xmath0 in which case the energy , as function of @xmath9 , resembles the form of either horizontal ( or vertical lines for the @xmath148 case , see figure 7 ) .",
    "the remarked existence of gaps which do not disappear for certain values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , even for large @xmath9 s , implied that the spectrum of the bounded multibarrier potential is singular . for example , it has been found for the @xmath148 case and for very small @xmath0 that the allowed energies have the form of vertical lines with nonvanishing gaps among them as seen in figure 7 .",
    "these gaps are quasi - periodically repeated along the @xmath9 axis and do not vanish for any value of it .",
    "the constancy of gaps in the energy spectrum of other physical systems , like the @xmath151 mentioned in section 5 , is interpreted in the literature @xcite as resulting from the singularity of the involved systems .",
    "we note that the spectrum of the infinite kronig - penney periodic potential is absolutely continuous @xcite . in such infinite periodic system",
    "one can not define , in contrast to bounded systems , any total length @xmath0 or any ratio @xmath1 of its total interval to total width .",
    "that is , the gaps in their energy spectrum , which do not depend on any such undefined @xmath0 and @xmath1 , can not be preserved , as in the bounded potential , merely by taking some limit or other values of these @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , their spectrum is , as remarked , generally absolutely continuous @xcite .",
    "there are , of course , the exceptional infinite periodic systems @xcite mentioned in section 5 which are characterized by nonvanishing gaps but for other reasons not related at all to any @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the bounded multibarrier potential discussed here allows one not only to define its total length @xmath0 and the related ratio of its total interval to total width but also to express the location of each barrier @xcite and consequently the allowed energies in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , there may be found , as actually shown in sections 3 - 4 , specific values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for which the gaps in the energy spectrum do not disappear even for large values of @xmath7 or ( and ) large @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , for large ( and intermediate ) @xmath0 and small @xmath1 the energy @xmath7 , as function of @xmath9 , of the bounded multibarrier potential have been shown to have the form of quasi - periodic half squares which are jumpy and discontinuous at their vertical sides ( see figures 1 - 2 and 4 - 5 ) .",
    "these discontinuities in the energy become small and insignificant only when @xmath0 decreases as may be seen in figure 3 for the @xmath5 case and in figure 6 for the @xmath6 one .",
    "when @xmath0 becomes very small the gaps in the energy spectrum becomes wider and are repeated along the positive @xmath9 axis as seen in figure 7 .    in summary",
    ", we see that the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential demonstrates through the discontinuities of @xmath7 , the nonvanishing gaps in its energy spectrum , its almost zero - range potential and its complete transmission that it is a singular system .",
    "we , now , discuss the case of the bounded one - dimensional multi - channelled multibarrier potential system and show , using eq ( [ e25 ] and the relation @xmath176 , that the transmission tends in this case to unity the length of each scatterer ( barrier ) is now @xmath177 where @xmath0 , for the bounded system , signifies the total length of all the scatterers ( barriers ) , and is some finite number .",
    "@xmath4 is the number of scatterers in the bounded system and @xmath11 is the number of channels in each scatterer where we assume @xmath178 .",
    "we assume in the following that @xmath11 is large but small compared to @xmath4 which , actually , satisfies @xmath179 .",
    "thus , denoting as before the product of the length of each scatterer and @xmath11 by @xmath158 ( so as to have now @xmath180 ) and using the former approximations of @xmath155 and @xmath181 , we may write eq ( [ e25 ] ) as @xmath182 now , when @xmath183 ( and still @xmath184 as for the analogous case of eq ( [ e25 ] ) ) we have now , due to @xmath178 , @xmath185 , and the reflection amplitude goes to zero in contrast to the result obtained from eq ( [ e25 ] ) . thus , from the relation between the reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath170 , we learn that @xmath168 goes to 1 as required .",
    "that is , we see that if the length of the sequence of scatterers is finite and if it is dense enough so that the number of scatterers @xmath4 is very large then the transmission coefficient goes to 1 even for large number of channels @xmath11 in each scatterer .",
