    "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ( laser ) is well known phenomenon routinely employed in solids - state , gas , and dye lasers @xcite-@xcite . with the development of micro and nano technology the new kind of lasers , so - called photonic crystal lasers , emerged @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the common peculiarity of the photonic crystal lasers is that they are made of finite number of particles or cells ordered at least in one dimension .",
    "these lasers are extremely versatile : they can be made from active host medium filled by passive scattering particles , or from active scatterers immersed into passive host medium , or both .",
    "moreover , the particles in such lasers can move or be static . from practical point of view",
    ", the photonic crystal lasers and amplifiers can be used as light sources to compensate the optical losses in metamaterials @xcite-@xcite .    to the author s knowledge ,",
    "the light generation by a scattering medium with negative resonance absorption was initially studied in work @xcite where it was shown that the lasing is possible in such medium .",
    "the scattering by individual active spheres and cylinders was studied analytically and numerically in a number of works ( see , for example @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . at the same time , the discussion of the scattering by a cluster of active particles is somewhat limited to very small clusters made of few particles @xcite or to periodic structures @xcite .",
    "scattering by many active particles occurs in so - called random lasers ( @xcite- @xcite ) , while analytical predictions are difficult to made for such systems due to extremely large number of particles .",
    "recently , the scalar wave scattering by dispersive particles was studied by using the local perturbation method ( lpm ) in the work @xcite . in reality , however , the vector wave scattering occurs .    to the author s knowledge ,",
    "the cluster amplifier made of small particles was not studied analytically and numerically in the literature before .    in this paper the light amplification and scattering by active particles with the size smaller than the incident wavelength is studied with the help of the lpm @xcite-@xcite and the phenomenological laser theory @xcite-@xcite . as an example , two important cases are studied numerically : scattering by ordered cluster and by weakly disordered cluster .",
    "it was shown that the light amplification is possible in both cases , however it is severely affected by the size of the particles , by the concentration of the doped active atoms , by interaction between the particles , and by morphological resonances .",
    "the formalism used in this section is described in a number of papers ( @xcite-@xcite ) and it will be briefly presented here for convenience and consistency .    consider the cluster positioned at the origin of the coordinates and made of @xmath0 identical active particles which characteristic size @xmath1 is small compared to the incident wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "the frequency - domain fourier transform @xmath3 of the electric field @xmath4 propagating in the host medium filled with the particles is described by the following equation @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radius vectors of the observer and the @xmath8-th particle respectively , and @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11  are the laplacian and nabla operators , @xmath12 defines tensor product , @xmath13 is a wave number in the host medium ( @xmath14 is the angular frequency and @xmath15 is the speed of light in vacuum ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the relative ( in respect to vacuum ) permittivities of the @xmath8-th particle and the host medium respectively , @xmath18 is the function describing the shape of the scatterers , @xmath19 is the volume of the @xmath8-th particle , and @xmath20 is the source of the field .",
    "the permittivity @xmath16  of the active particles is , in principle , a complex function depending on the electric field @xmath21 inside the particle , the frequency @xmath14 , and other parameters .",
    "we will discuss this topic in greater detail in the next section .",
    "it should be noted , that the equation ( [ plas10 ] ) is an approximate one and it is correct only when the small scatterers ( @xmath22 ) are considered .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ plas10 ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath23 where the scattered field @xmath24 is @xmath25 and @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the @xmath28 unitary tensor in polarization space and @xmath7 is the radius vector of the n - th particle .",
    "the function @xmath29 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath18 .",
    "the incident field @xmath30 is created by the source @xmath31 in the host medium ( more information can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the formula ( [ plas14 ] ) is rather general one and it describes the field scattered by the cluster made of small particles of arbitrary form .",
    "the resonance properties and interference between the scatterers are taken into account by the fields @xmath21 inside the particles .",
    "the fields @xmath32 should be found by solving the system of @xmath33 linear equations obtained by substituting @xmath34 into ( [ plas12 ] ) .",
    "the scattered field ( [ plas14 ] ) can be simplified when the observer is outside of the cluster , such that @xmath35 . in this case",
    "the integrals ( [ plas18 ] ) can be calculated explicitly and the scattered field ( [ plas14 ] ) can be presented in the following form @xmath36 where @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the distance between the observation point @xmath6 and the radius vector @xmath7 of the @xmath8-th scatterer , @xmath39 is the scatterer s volume .    in many practical cases",
    "the distance between the cluster and the observer is much larger than the size of the cluster , i.e. @xmath40 , and in addition , the condition @xmath41 is satisfied . in this case",
    "the field ( [ plas20 ] ) can be simplified and it can be rewritten in the following form @xmath42 where @xmath43    we note that the formula ( [ plas24 ] ) is the final expression for the field scattered by the cluster of small particles , and it will be used in the following discussion .",
    "in this section we will study the permittivity @xmath16 of the active particles which characteristic size is much smaller than the incident wavelength ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the particles are active due to doped active atoms with the density @xmath44 .",
    "we note that the permittivity @xmath16 in formula ( [ plas24 ] ) can be complex number with negative or positive imaginary part , and in this case one can study wave scattering with gain or loss in active media @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the problem with such approach is two - fold .",
    "first , the value of the imaginary part is not related to the properties of the actual medium , and second , the permittivity is the same for all particles , that is not true for real systems .",
    "as it was suggested in @xcite , such approach is valid for quantitative estimations of lasers before threshold . for",
    "more accurate investigation one should use rigorous methods taking into account atomic transitions and pump dissipation .    it is important to acknowledge that when the particles are small the number of active atoms in upper state is constant within the particle , while this number can be different for other particles .",
    "we assume that all the scatterers have the same density @xmath44 of the active atoms .",
    "it is not limiting assumption , and it is very convenient one .",
    "we also assume that the amplifier is at steady state , so the densities of the active atoms in the upper and low states are time independent .",
    "we approximate the active atoms as two - level systems exited by the optical pump with the frequency @xmath45 and relaxing with the wide range of the frequencies @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we can present the permittivity @xmath16 of the small particles in the following form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the permittivity of the @xmath8-th scatterer without the active atoms and @xmath50 is the permittivity of the @xmath8-th particle due to the presence of the active atoms .",
    "the latter can be expressed in the following form @xcite @xmath51 , \\ ;   \\label{plas26a}\\ ] ] where the emission and the absorption cross sections of the active medium respectively are @xmath52 and the density of the active atoms is @xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the densities of the active atoms in the upper and low states respectively , and @xmath44 is the total density of the active atoms .",
    "the frequencies @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the resonance frequencies for absorption and emission respectively , and @xmath58 is the oscillator strength . the frequencies @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the dipole relaxation frequencies for the absorption and the emission respectively ( typical values are about @xmath61 hz @xcite ) , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the electron s charge and mass respectively .",
    "the importance of the formula ( [ plas26a ] ) is that it allows us to use experimentally measured emission and absorption cross sections ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) when the density @xmath54 is known .",
    "this approach will be used in the following section where the results of the numerical calculations will be presented .",
    "it should be noted also that we neglected by the real part of the permittivity @xmath66 because it is small compared to the optical contrast @xmath67 , especially near the resonance .",
    "we note that the formulae ( [ plas26b ] ) were calculated assuming that @xmath68 , @xmath56 .",
    "the expressions ( [ plas26 ] ) and ( [ plas26a ] ) for the permittivity of the particles suggest that the densities @xmath54 and @xmath55 should be known .",
    "we can find them by using the rate equation approximation ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "when the pulse duration exceeds the dipole relaxation time ( typically @xmath69 s ) , the density @xmath54  of the upper level atoms can be calculated by using the rate equation approximation in which the dopants respond so fast that the induced polarization follows the optical field adiabatically @xcite .",
    "we use the following rate equation @xcite @xmath70- % m_{u}(\\mathbf{r}_{n})/\\tau ,   \\label{plas27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 here @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the absorption and the emission cross sections at the frequency @xmath46 respectively , and @xmath74 is the flux of photons at the frequency @xmath46 , and the @xmath75 brackets denote the absolute value .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 is the relaxation time of the exited atom ( typically @xmath77 s @xcite ) , @xmath78 is the reduced planck constant , and @xmath79 is the frequency bin .    since we consider only steady state solutions when @xmath80 the solution of the rate equation ( [ plas27 ] ) is @xmath81 and the formula ( [ plas26a ] ) for the permittivity @xmath66 has the form @xmath82 } { 1/\\tau + \\sum_{j}^{n_{\\omega}}i_{j}(% \\mathbf{r}_{n},\\omega _ { j})(\\sigma _ { aj}+\\sigma _ { ej } ) }   \\label{plas32}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the formula ( [ plas32 ] ) is the main result of this section and it shows that the permittivity of the small active scatterer is a complex function of the intensities of the fields @xmath83 inside the particles , frequency @xmath14 , position of the particles @xmath84 , and absorption and emission cross sections @xmath72 and @xmath73 . when the light intensity changes ( due to increased reflection from the scatterer s boundaries or due to decreased amount of the scattered light from all other particles , for example ) , it will affect the permittivity @xmath50 ( [ plas32 ] ) .",
    "we note that the photon fluxes @xmath85 should be found by solving the system of nonlinear equations with respect to the fields @xmath86 inside the particles .",
    "as the expression ( [ plas32 ] ) for the permittivity of the small active particles suggests , the field scattered by the cluster should be found by solving the system of nonlinear equations with respect to the fields @xmath21 inside the particles .    however , this tedious task is essentially simplified in our case , because we consider the scattering by small particles . as the result ,",
    "the scattered field is small compared to the incident one , and it is natural to use perturbation theory where the intensities @xmath74 are small compared to the pump intensity @xmath87 .",
    "we distinct pump and signal ( anything but a pump ) frequencies @xmath45 , and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "when the signal is so small that @xmath88 the permittivity ( [ plas32 ] ) can be expressed in the approximate form @xmath89 } { 1/\\tau + i_{p}(\\mathbf{r}_{n},\\omega _ { p})(\\sigma _ { ap}+\\sigma _ { ep})}.   \\label{plas37}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some estimations it can be sufficient to use the permittivity ( [ plas37 ] ) , while for rigorous numerical calculations one can apply general formula ( [ plas32 ] ) where fluxes @xmath74 are found by using the method of successive approximations .",
    "when emission and absorption spectra are very distinct and separated such that @xmath90 , we can simplify the formula ( [ plas37 ] ) for the pump and the signal respectively @xmath91 the important feature of the formulae ( [ plas38 ] ) is the sign flip : for the pump it is positive ( the pump is absorbed ) and for the signal it is negative ( the signal is amplified ) .",
    "we define the intensity of the scattered field as @xmath92 , and by using the formula ( [ plas24 ] ) we can present the intensity in the following form @xmath93 where @xmath94 and the permittivity @xmath16 is described by the expression ( [ plas32 ] ) or by ( [ plas37 ] ) .",
    "the expression ( [ plas40 ] ) suggests that the light amplification ( related to the imaginary part of the permittivity @xmath16 ) is due to step wise amplification inside each active particle , and it is coded in the fields @xmath21 . below we consider the fields @xmath21 in grater detail for one active particle .",
    "nm.,width=343 ]      consider the light amplification by small active sphere . in this case",
    "the intensity of the scattered field is described by the expression ( [ plas40 ] ) where the field @xmath95 has the following form @xcite @xmath96 and the denominator @xmath97 is @xmath98 the resonance frequency @xmath99 is found from the following equation @xmath100 and the resonance width @xmath101 is defined as @xmath102 in accordance with formulae ( [ plas403 ] ) and ( [ plas404 ] ) the resonance width @xmath103 and the resonance frequency @xmath104 respectively are @xmath105 and @xmath106 when the permittivity @xmath107 of the particle is real , the resonance width is defined by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ plas405 ] ) .",
    "when the imaginary part of the permittivity @xmath107 is taken into account and it is negative or positive , the resonance width can be slightly decreased or increased respectively .",
    "the formulae ( [ plas405 ] ) and ( [ plas26a ] ) suggest that when @xmath108 , the resonance width increases ( with respect to the one in the passive medium ) and it decreases when @xmath109 .",
    "this decrease ( or increase ) corresponds to effective gain ( or loss ) of the field scattered by the particle at the resonance frequency .",
    "we note that similar conclusions can be drawn for the clusters consisting of two and more particles , while the analytical investigation of such systems is much more complicated .     versus normalized frequency @xmath110 for the spherical cluster made of small cubes with different density of the active atoms @xmath44 .",
    "the period of the cluster is d=2.2l , and the permittivity of the particles and the host medium is @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively , the characteristic size of the cubes is @xmath113 nm , and the total number of the particles in the cluster is @xmath114.,width=351 ]",
    "in this section the light amplification and scattering by active clusters ( clusters made of an active material ) is studied numerically . the normalized intensity @xmath115 of the scattered field is calculated .",
    "the normalized intensity is defined as @xmath116    all the used clusters are 3d structures ( as shown , for example , on the figure [ fig1 ] ) made of cubes doped with @xmath117 ( active material ) .",
    "the absorption and emission cross sections are taken from @xcite and the other parameters are from @xcite .",
    "the incident field is generated by the point source described by the following formula @xmath118 where the field @xmath119 is polarized along @xmath120 direction .",
    "the source is positioned at @xmath121 and the center of the cluster is positioned at the origin of coordinates @xmath122 .",
    "the pump wavelength is selected to be @xmath123 nm , and at this specific wavelength the field @xmath124 is artificially increased by several orders of magnitude to simulate the pump . finally , the perturbation theory is used to calculate the density of the upper level atoms .     versus normalized frequency @xmath110 for slightly disordered spherical cluster made of small cubes .",
    "the results of two runs are presented , and the scattering by the ordered cluster is also shown for comparison .",
    "the period of the cluster is d=2.2l , and the density of the active atoms is @xmath125 m@xmath126 .",
    "the permittivity of the particles and the host medium is @xmath111 and @xmath127 respectively , the characteristic size of the cubes is @xmath128 nm , and the total number of the particles in the cluster is @xmath114.,width=351 ]      consider the scattering by the spherical cluster made of the small active cubes organized into simple cubic lattice .",
    "the size of the cubes in the cluster is @xmath128 nm , the period is @xmath129 , the radius of the cluster is @xmath130 .",
    "the permittivity of the scatterers is @xmath131 and the permittivity of the host medium is @xmath132 .",
    "such combination of the cluster s permittivity and dimensions creates optical resonance of the passive cluster ( cluster without any active material ) near @xmath133 ( @xmath134 nm ) .",
    "the figure [ fig2 ] shows the normalized intensity @xmath115 of the scattered field for the active clusters with @xmath117 density @xmath125 m@xmath126 ( upper solid line ) , @xmath135 m@xmath126 ( dash - dotted line ) , and @xmath136 m@xmath126 ( dashed line ) . for comparison , the intensity of the scattered field from the passive cluster with @xmath117 density @xmath137 m@xmath126 ( lower solid line ) is also presented .",
    "the figure [ fig2 ] shows that light is significantly amplified at the selected frequency @xmath138 for the doping exceeding @xmath136 m@xmath126 .",
    "for relatively low @xmath44 , when the doping increases 2.5 times ( from @xmath136 m@xmath126 to @xmath139 m@xmath126 ) , the intensity grows only 1.6 times .",
    "however , for relatively higher @xmath44 , when the doping increases only 2 times ( from @xmath139 m@xmath126 to @xmath140 m@xmath126 ) , the intensity grows 2.25 times .",
    "additional simulations ( not presented here ) suggest that at even high doping , the light amplification increases several orders of magnitude while the doping increases only few times .",
    "we realize that the size of the cluster used in our calculation is too small to made a lasing with the conventional values of the doping @xmath44",
    "( @xmath141 m@xmath126 ) and that is why we have presented only results with @xmath44 smaller than physically realistic limit ( @xmath142 m@xmath126 ) .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the light amplification and scattering by the active cluster which particles are randomly positioned near predefined positions .",
    "the predefined positions are the nodes of the cubic lattice with the period of @xmath129 , and the particles are positioned not further than @xmath143 from the nodes to avoid a collision .",
    "we note that the distance @xmath143 is actually @xmath144 nm , that is much less than the size of the particle @xmath1 , and that is why we call this cluster weakly disordered one .",
    "we note that the density of the active atoms in the cluster is @xmath125 m@xmath126 .",
    "the permittivity of the particles and the host medium is @xmath111 and @xmath127 respectively , the characteristic size of the cubes is @xmath128 nm , and the total number of the particles in the cluster is @xmath114 .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented on the figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the figure shows the results of two simulation runs for the disordered cluster ( dashed and dash dotted lines ) and one result for ordered cluster ( solid line ) for comparison .",
    "the figure suggests that despite weak positional disorder the random positioning significantly influences the scattering and amplification by the cluster . in our particular case ,",
    "two scattering peaks compete with each other : one near @xmath145 ( @xmath146 nm ) and another is near @xmath147 ( @xmath148 nm ) .",
    "this feature is probably related to the emission spectrum of active material ( @xmath117 ) which has two crests : very narrow one near @xmath149 nm and broad one near @xmath150 nm .    the random amplifier differs from the nonrandom one in a number of ways .",
    "the first difference is the absence of well defined boundaries , which in turn , govern the morphological resonances .",
    "thus , the amplification ( or lasing ) can be at several frequencies simultaneously .",
    "the second difference is the random structure inside the cluster , affecting the interaction between the particles and the total gain as the result .",
    "the light amplification and scattering by the cluster made of the small active particles have been studied analytically and numerically .",
    "the light amplification has been discussed for small active particle .",
    "it has been suggested that the amplification ( or loss ) effectively occurs in the active particle due to narrowing ( or broadening ) of the resonance .",
    "the light scattering by the ordered and slightly disordered clusters of small active particles has been calculated numerically .",
    "the numerical simulations have been shown that the light amplification occurs near the morphological resonances which are governed by the shape of the cluster and its optical contrast .",
