    "in @xcite fox proposed a program to distinguish 3-manifolds by the differences in their  knot theories \" . following the program , brody @xcite",
    "re - obtained the topological classification of the 3-dimensional lens spaces using knot - theoretic invariants , which are the alexander polynomials of knots suitably factored out so that it depends only on the homology classes of the knots .",
    "bing s recognition theorem @xcite can be regarded as another example of works that follow fox s program , where the theorem asserts that a closed , connected 3-manifold @xmath1 is homeomorphic to the @xmath2-sphere if and only if every knot in @xmath1 can be moved by an isotopy to lie within a 3-ball .",
    "we note here that if we replace _ isotopy _ in this statement by _ homotopy _ , the assertion implies poincar conjecture , which was proved by perelman @xcite .",
    "bing s recognition theorem was generalized by hass - thompson @xcite and kobayashi - nishi @xcite proving that a closed , connected 3-manifold @xmath1 admits a genus @xmath3 heegaard splitting if and only if there exists a genus @xmath3 handlebody @xmath4 embedded in @xmath1 so that every knot in @xmath1 can be moved by an isotopy to lie within @xmath4 .",

    "let @xmath1 be a compact , connected , proper 3-submanifold of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is _ unknotted _ if its exterior is a disjoint union of handlebodies .",
    "a famous theorem of fox @xcite says that each @xmath1 can be re - embedded in @xmath0 so that its image is unknotted . a re - embedding satisfying this property",
    "are called a _ fox re - embedding_. intuitively speaking , unknottedness of @xmath11 implies that @xmath1 is embedded @xmath0 in one of the  simplest \" ways .",
    "we note that if @xmath1 is a handlebody , an unknotted @xmath1 in @xmath0 is actually unique up to isotopy by waldhausen @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness up to isotopy and a reflection holds for each knot exterior by a celebrated result of gordon - luecke @xcite .",
    "however , in other cases @xmath1 usually admits many mutually non - isotopic fox re - embeddings into @xmath0 .",
    "the unknottedness of a 3-submanifold and so the existence of a fox re - embedding can be considered for an arbitrary closed , connected @xmath2-manifold .",
    "scharlemann - thompson @xcite generalized the above theorem of fox by proving that any compact , connected , proper 3-submanifold of irreducible non - haken 3-manifolds",
    "@xmath12 admits a fox re - embedding into @xmath12 or @xmath0 .",
    "another generalization is given by nakamura @xcite who proved that a compact , connected , proper 3-submanifold @xmath1 of a closed , connected @xmath2-manifold @xmath12 admits a fox re - embedding into @xmath12 if every knot in @xmath12 can be moved by an isotopy to lie within @xmath1 .",
    "here we remark that the property that    every knot in @xmath12 can be moved by an isotopy to lie within @xmath1    does _ not _ imply that @xmath1 itself is unknotted in @xmath12 .",
    "this can be seen for example by considering the case where @xmath13 and @xmath1 is not unknotted . in this paper",
    ", we will show that the property of a compact , connected , proper 3-submanifold @xmath1 of @xmath0 that    every knot in @xmath1 can be moved by a homotopy in @xmath1 to be the trivial knot in @xmath0    implies that @xmath1 is unknotted in @xmath0 .",
    "following letscher @xcite , we say that a knot @xmath14 in @xmath1 is _ transient in @xmath1 _ if @xmath14 can be deformed by a homotopy in @xmath1 to be the trivial knot in @xmath0 ; @xmath14 is said to be _ persistent in @xmath1 _ otherwise .",
    "using this terminology , we can state our main theorem as follows :    let @xmath1 be a compact , connected , proper @xmath2-submanifold of @xmath0 .",
    "then every knot in @xmath1 is transient in @xmath1 if and only if @xmath1 is unknotted .",
    "roughly speaking , the above theorem implies that a ( homotopic ) property of knots in @xmath1 deduces an isotopic property of @xmath1 inside @xmath0 .",
    "we remark that the property that a given knot @xmath15 is transient is _ extrinsic _ with respect to the embedding @xmath16 in the sense that it depends not only the pair @xmath17 but also the way how @xmath1 is embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , we can find a persistent knot in a certain genus two handlebody @xmath4 embedded in @xmath0 in such a way that there exists another embedding of @xmath4 into @xmath0 such that the re - embedded knots in the re - embedded @xmath4 is transient .",
    "see section [ sec : transient knots in a subspace of the 3-sphere ] .",
    "now , we can say a little more precisely what is the relative version of fox s program ; we expect that extrinsic properties for knots in a compact , connected , proper 3-submanifold of @xmath0 distinguish the isotopy class of @xmath1 inside @xmath0 .",
    "our main theorem is a first step for the program . to obtain the theorem",
    ", we discuss relation between certain group - theoretic and homotopic properties of knots in a compact 3-manifold , which can be of independent interest , see section [ sec : knots filling up a handlebody ] .    given a knot @xmath14 in a compact , connected , proper 3-submanifold @xmath1 of @xmath0",
    ", it is actually difficult in general to detect if @xmath14 is persistent in @xmath1 .",
    "one method was provided by letscher @xcite that uses what he calls the _ persistent alexander polynomial_. in section [ sec : construction of persistent knots ] , we provide examples of persistent knots in a 3-subspace of @xmath0 whose persistency are shown by using the notion of _ persistent lamination _ and _ accidental surface_.    in section [ sec : transient number of knots ] , we will introduce an integer - valued invariant , _ transient number _ , of knots in @xmath0 whose definition is related to theorem [ thm : transiency and unknottedness ] as follows .",
    "given a knot @xmath14 in @xmath0 , we may consider a system of simple arcs in @xmath0 with their endpoints in @xmath14 such that @xmath14 is transient in a regular neighborhood of the union of @xmath14 and the arcs .",
    "the transient number @xmath18 is then defined to be the minimal number of simple arcs in such a system . by an easy observation",
    ", we see that the transient number is bounded from above by both the unknotting number and the tunnel number .",
    "further , we will give a knot @xmath14 that attains @xmath19 while @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the unknotting number and the tunnel number of @xmath14 , respectively ( see proposition [ prop : difference between tr and u , t ] ) .",
    "in other words , the union of the sets of knots of unknotting number one and tunnel number one is actually a proper subset of the set of knots of transient number one .",
