    "the paper is written to the 70th anniversary of vladimir igorevich arnold .",
    "this is just a small mathematical souvenir but i hope that vladimir igorevich will get some pleasure looking over it .",
    "the content of the paper is well described by the cryptogram below .",
    "the figure represents the roots system of the exceptional group @xmath0 ( the automorphisms group of octonions ) and two touching each other circles whose diameters are in ratio 3:1 .",
    "our starting point is a classical nonholonomic kinematic system that is rather important in robotics : a rigid body rolling over a surface without slipping or twisting .",
    "the surface is supposed to be the surface of another rigid body so that the situation is , in fact , symmetric : one body is rolling over another one .",
    "we also assume that the surfaces of the bodies are smooth and can not touch each other in more than one point .",
    "this system has a 5-dimensional configuration space : coordinates of the points on each surface where the surfaces touch each other give 4 parameters ; fifth parameter measures mutual orientation of the bodies at the touching point .",
    "now let us imagine one of the bodies immovable and another rolling .",
    "given an initial configuration , it is rather clear that one can roll the body in a unique way along any curve on the immovable surface starting from the initial touching point .",
    "in other words , given an initial configuration , admissible motions are parameterized by the curves on the two - dimensional surface with a fixed initial point .",
    "on the other hand , it is not hard to prove ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.24 ) ) that admissible motions allow to reach any configuration from any other as soon as two bodies are not congruent .",
    "we are thus in a typical nonholonomic situation since the configuration space is 5-dimensional .",
    "now turn to mathematics .",
    "admissible velocities ( i.e. velocities of admissible motions ) form a rank 2 vector distribution on the configuration space .",
    "this distribution is involutive if and only if our bodies are the balls of equal radii .",
    "more precisely , let vector fields @xmath1 form a local basis of our distribution , @xmath2 $ ] be the commutator ( lie bracket ) of the fields , and @xmath3 a point of the configuration space .",
    "it happens that vectors @xmath4(q)$ ] are linearly independent if and only if the curvatures of two surfaces are not equal at their touching points corresponding to the configuration @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , if these curvatures are not equal , then : @xmath5(q)\\wedge [ f,[f , g]](q)\\wedge [ g,[g , f]](q ) \\ne 0 .",
    "\\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] in other words , the basic fields , their first and second order lie brackets are all linearly independent .",
    "the germs of rank 2 distributions in @xmath6 with property ( 1 ) were first studied by elie cartan in his famous paper @xcite .",
    "a brief count of parameters demonstrates that 5 is the lowest dimension where the classification of generic germs of distributions must have functional invariants .",
    "this happens for rank 2 and rank 3 distributions in @xmath6 ; moreover , the classifications for both values of the rank are essentially equivalent and it is sufficient to study the case of rank 2 .",
    "cartan found a fundamental tensor invariant that is a degree 4 symmetric form on the distribution : the desired functional invariant is just the cross - ratio of the roots of this form .",
    "there is exactly one equivalence class for which the cartan s form is identical zero .",
    "we call the germs from this class _ flat _ ; a germ of the distribution is flat if and only if it admits a basis generating the 5-dimensional nilpotent lie algebra .",
    "cartan showed that symmetry group of a flat distribution is the split form of the 14-dimensional exceptional simple lie group @xmath0 . in all other cases , dimension of the symmetry group does not exceed 7 .",
    "how all that is related to the rolling bodies ? it is rather obvious that the group of symmetries of the  no slipping no twisting distribution \" is trivial for generic bodies .",
    "this group acts transitively on the configuration space if and only if the surfaces of both bodies have constant curvatures .",
    "let us stay with the case of constant nonnegative curvatures so that the surfaces are spheres ( one of them may be a plane , i.e. the sphere of the infinite radius ) .",
    "natural symmetries are isometries of the spheres ; they form a 6-dimensional lie group .",
    "it was robert bryant who claimed first that no slipping no twisting distribution is flat in the case of spheres whose radii are in ratio 3:1 .",
    "he insisted that just followed the cartan s method and never published this fact in a paper or a preprint .",
    "it also remained absolutely unclear what are hidden additional symmetries ( dimension of the symmetry group jumps from 6 to 14 when ratio of the radii gets 3:1 ! ) .",
    "unfortunately , cartan s method does not give much in this regard : the construction of the fundamental invariant is based on the involved reduction ",
    "prolongation procedures in the jet spaces , and any connection with the original geometric problem is lost quite far from the end of the way .",
    "the goal of this note is to finally untwine this puzzle . in section",
    "2 we give a simple twistor model for the configuration space of the rolling balls problem and for the no slipping no twisting distribution ; the role of the group @xmath0 is not yet clear from this model .    split form of @xmath0 is the group of automorphisms of _ split - octonions _ , a hyperbolic version of usual octonions , where positive definite quadratic form ( square of the norm of octonions ) is substituted by a non - degenerate sign - indefinite quadratic form .",
    "split - octonions have nontrivial divisors of zero ( zero locus of the sign - indefinite form ) .",
    "a simple quadratic transformation demonstrates that no slipping no twisting distribution is equivalent to the  divisors of zero distribution \" of split - octonions if the radii of the balls are in ratio 3:1 .",
    "this is the subject of section  3 .    in section  4",
    "we outline a recently developed variational way to construct differential invariants of vector distributions in order to put the rolling bodies model in a broader framework and to explain the meaning of basic invariants .",
    "_ acknowledgements .",
    "_ i am grateful to robert bryant , aroldo kaplan and igor zelenko for very interesting stimulating discussions .",
    "we study admissible motions of two balls @xmath7 and @xmath8 rolling one over another without slipping or twisting . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the radii of the balls .",
    "instant configuration of the system of two balls is determined by an orientation preserving isometry of the tangent planes to the spheres @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the points where the balls touch each other . in other words ,",
    "the state space of our kinematic system is : @xmath13    it is easy to see that @xmath14 is a smooth 5-dimensional manifold .",
    "motions of the system are families of isometries @xmath15 .",
    "the no slipping condition reads : @xmath16 the no twisting condition requires that @xmath17 transforms parallel along @xmath18 vector fields in the parallel along @xmath19 vector fields .",
    "these two conditions define a rank  2 vector distribution @xmath20 on @xmath14 .",
    "we have : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a two - dimensional subspace of @xmath23 ; admissible motions of the two balls system are exactly integral curves of the distribution @xmath20 . given an initial configuration , the ball @xmath7 can be rolled in a unique way along any smooth curve on @xmath24 and the same is true if we transpose @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the formal geometric language",
    "this observation just means that the subspace @xmath25 where @xmath26 , is projected one - to - one onto @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .    in what follows ,",
    "we treat @xmath30 and @xmath24 as unit spheres in @xmath31 with re - scaled metrics : @xmath32 , the homothety @xmath33 , transforms @xmath14 in @xmath34 .",
    "we set @xmath35 .",
    "the distribution @xmath36 on @xmath34 is determined by the  re - scaled no slipping condition \" @xmath37 and the no twisting condition ; the last one remains unchanged .    from now on we will deal with fixed space",

    "@xmath36 we use a classical quaternion s parameterization of spherical bundle @xmath39 , to the unit sphere @xmath40 , where @xmath41 let us recall this parameterization .",
    "we identify @xmath31 with the space of imaginary quaternions : @xmath42 let @xmath43 be the group of unitary quaternions ; then @xmath44 is the classical hopf bundle , while the mapping @xmath45 is a double covering .",
    "moreover , the diagram @xmath46 is commutative , hence @xmath47 is a fiber - wise mapping of the bundle @xmath48 onto the bundle @xmath49 which induces a double covering of the fibers .",
    "the fibers of the bundle @xmath50 are the residue classes @xmath51 of the one - parametric subgroup generated by @xmath52 .",
    "the normal to the fibers distribution @xmath53 is a connection on the principal bundle @xmath50 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath47 transforms this connection in the levi civita connection on the bundle @xmath54 , which defines standard parallel transport on @xmath55 .",
    "we are now ready to give a quaternion s model of the rolling balls configuration space @xmath34 ( more precisely , of a double covering to @xmath34 ) and of the no slipping no twisting distributions @xmath36 . for any @xmath56 there",
    "exists a unique orientation preserving isometry of the fiber @xmath57 on the fiber @xmath58 that sends @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "this isometry sends @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , pairs @xmath63 and @xmath64 define one and the same isometry if and only if @xmath65 ( with one and the same @xmath66 ) .",
    "hence the coset space of @xmath67 by the action @xmath68 of the one - parametric group @xmath69 is a double covering of @xmath34 .",
