    "the form of the electric field shows that the radiation from cusps is linearly polarized in the direction @xmath34 . furthermore",

    "the energy arriving at a distance @xmath41 is given by @xmath42    cosmic string loops are large objects and the fundamental frequency of radiation , given by @xmath43 , is very small .",
    "hence , radiation that can be observed is due to emission at very high harmonics .",
    "although the energy per solid angle does not depend on the frequency , the width of the beam @xmath36 does become smaller with increasing frequency .",
    "this suggests that the event rate will be largest at lower frequencies where the beam is wider .",
    "hence , it seems favorable to seek bursts from strings in the radio band , though the dependence of the event rate on frequency can be more complicated because the more numerous small loops produce higher frequencies .",
    "we now examine the event rate in more detail .",
    "arguments of scale invariance and simulations of a cosmic string network indicate that the loop distribution function in the radiation - dominated epoch is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number density of loops of size @xmath46 at cosmic time @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the time of radiation - matter equality , and @xmath49 . in the matter - dominated epoch , @xmath50 , there will be two components to the loop distribution .",
    "the first is the loops that were produced in the radiation - dominated era but survived into the matter era .",

    "we will take @xmath55 .",

    "therefore , the loop distribution function , taking energy losses into account , is @xmath63 where @xmath64 for @xmath65 , the radiation era loops are more important because we will be interested in @xmath66 whereas @xmath67 . for larger @xmath46 ,",

    "if the loop is at cosmological redshift , the observed rate of cusps on a given loop will be @xmath75 due to time dilation .",
    "the radiation from a cusp can be emitted in any direction .",
    "only the bursts pointing in the direction of the observer are relevant . since the beam width at frequency @xmath37 is @xmath76 [ eq .  ( [ beamwidth ] ) ] ,",
    "the event rate will be suppressed by a factor @xmath77 .",
    "combining all these factors gives an event `` production '' rate in a spatial volume @xmath78 , @xmath79 note that the beam of radiation emitted from a cusp is wider at lower frequencies .",
    "thus , if a burst is observed at a particular frequency @xmath80 , it will also be observed at all lower frequencies .",

    "thus , the event rate must be expressed in terms of quantities such as the energy flux per frequency interval , @xmath88 , to which the instrument is sensitive , and the burst duration , @xmath89 , that can be detected .",
    "so , we must transform the variables @xmath90 occuring in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prodrate ] ) to @xmath91 . that will give the event rate in terms of variables that are relevant to observation .",
    "the observed frequency is related to the emitted frequency by a redshift factor @xmath92 the energy flux per frequency interval can be found from the radiated energy in eq .",
    "( [ eemission ] ) , which gives the total energy radiated from the cusp . to get the energy radiated per unit time , we need to divide that expression by the observed duration of the burst , @xmath89 .",

    "( [ ddotnfinal ] ) as functions of the flux and burst duration .",
    "first , in fig .  [ fig : event_a ] we plot the differential event rate as a function of @xmath88 for several different choices of @xmath101 and @xmath89 .",
    "the plot is made on a log - log scale to accommodate the wide range of scales , and shows two different power law behaviors , consistent with the analytical results in eqs .",
    "( [ dndothighs ] ) and ( [ dndotlows ] ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : event_c ] , we show the dependence of the differential event rate on the burst duration for a variety of values of @xmath88 and @xmath101 .",
    "the integrated event rate as a function of the flux @xmath88 and burst duration @xmath89 is shown in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : event_in ] .",
    "the asymptotic fits to these plots are @xmath146 hence , an experiment that integrates events over the ranges of @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ranges ] ) , and is sensitive to milli jansky fluxes , will observe on the order of @xmath147 radio bursts per month , if there are superconducting cosmic strings with the chosen parameters . turning this figure around , a search for cosmological radio transients can place stringent constraints on superconducting cosmic strings . if we consider radio bursts emitted by superconducting strings with observable frequency 1.23 ghz and flux greater than @xmath148 , the event rate is @xmath149 per hour , and is a factor of 10 smaller than the upper bound given by the parkes survey @xcite , @xmath150 per hour .",
    "since the predicted event rate depends on the string parameters , this result implies that current radio experiments already rule out an interesting part of parameter space ( current and string tension ) .",
    "we have addressed two observational aspects of radio transients produced by cusps on superconducting strings .",
    "first , we have shown that the radiation emitted along the beam direction is linearly polarized , and the direction of polarization is independent of the frequency .",
    "the polarization can be used as a discriminating signature for radio bursts from superconducting strings , though a more detailed study should also consider the dependence of the polarization as a function of angle from the direction of the beam and the variation in the polarization over the duration of the event .",
    "second , we have calculated the event rate of radio bursts from cusps on superconducting strings in terms of observational variables , namely , the burst duration and the flux .",
    "our calculation includes the jacobian that results from the transformation from string variables to observational variables .",
    "unlike burst events in higher energy parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , a novelty of the calculation for radio bursts is that the burst duration depends on the redshift of the burst event due to two contributions : the cosmological redshift and the scattering due to intervening matter .",
    "as is well understood , the former grows with redshift as @xmath151 and when the redshifting of the frequency is also taken into account , gives a duration of @xmath152 .",
    "the contribution of scattering is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltats ] ) @xcite and is somewhat counterintuitive because it diminishes with increasing redshift . to understand this ( partially ) , we note that the burst duration increases due to scattering because scattering allows photons to bend into the direction of the observer . if the relevant scattering can be thought to occur at roughly half the distance to the source , for a source that is farther away , the halfway scattering point is also more distant . therefore , for fixed observational frequency",
    ", the frequency at the scattering point is also higher , and hence scattering is less efficient . thus more distant bursts get a smaller contribution to their duration from the scattering .",
    "the two contributions to the burst duration are added in quadrature , yielding eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "we have also found the integrated event rate as a function of the flux and burst duration .",
    "for the canonical set of parameters listed in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , the integrated event rates are reasonable , at the level of one event per month . such event rates indicate that the search for radio bursts can serve as excellent probes of the superconducting string model .",
    "our analysis has been performed under some simplifying assumptions that may need to be reexamined in the future .",
    "our formula for the burst duration due to scattering of radio waves , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltats ] ) , should be reexamined in the cosmological context , since the relevant cosmological epochs are concurrent with reionization , formation of large scale structure , and other astrophysical activity .",
    "note that we have also neglected the cosmological acceleration which will dilute the number density of cosmic strings and thus reduce the event rate of radio bursts at low redshifts .",
    "we have also sharply cut off all radio bursts prior to the epoch of recombination . in principle",
    ", there will be a gradual cut - off , though this may not make much difference to the final results . from the string side ,",
    "we have assumed a constant current on all strings , whereas we expect the current to grow as a string cuts through ambient magnetic fields .",
    "if a primordial magnetic field exists , our assumption may be justified . in the absence of a primordial magnetic field ,",
    "currents on strings will build up only after structures have generated magnetic fields .",
    "we have also assumed that the dominant energy loss from strings is due to gravitational radiation and not due to electromagnetic losses , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath153 . for @xmath154 , this is valid if the string energy scale is larger than @xmath143 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath155 . for",
    "yet lighter strings , @xmath57 will be set by electromagnetic losses , and for very light strings , @xmath156 , the strings are dragged by the cosmological plasma , at least on large length scales , and the string dynamics will be very different . in the regime where gravitational losses dominate and radio bursts due to short loops",
    "dominate the event rate , our numerical results give @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "if the string parameters are such that the power lost to electromagnetic radiation is larger than that to gravitational radiation , we should replace the expression for gravitational power emission , @xmath160 , by the electromagnetic power @xmath161 .",
    "this occurs when @xmath162 .",
    "then , @xmath163    there are several radio telescopes currently in operation searching for radio transients , e.g. , parkes @xcite , eta @xcite , lwa @xcite , lofar @xcite , and others under construction , e.g. , ska @xcite",
    ". it would be useful to tailor the analysis in our paper to the specific range of observational parameters that will be employed in these searches .",
    "cosmic string cusps also produce gravitational wave bursts @xcite , which can be detectable by sensitive interferometers such as ligo , virgo , and lisa , ultra high energy neutrino bursts @xcite , which can be detectable by the space - based cosmic ray detector jem - euso and by radio telescopes lofar and ska via askaryan effect @xcite",
    ". there has already been some initiative to look for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave bursts at ligo and virgo @xcite .",
    "linearly polarized radio signal and simultaneous detection of accompanying bursts from the same cusp can help distinguish cosmic strings from astrophysical sources , and hence help to discover cosmic strings or to put constraints on superconducting string parameters .",

    "<S> a radio burst from a superconducting cosmic string will have to be distinguished among bursts from other potential astrophysical sources . with this in mind , we recalculate the characteristics of the string burst and show that it is linearly polarized in a direction that is independent of the frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the feasibility of observations depends on the event rates for radio bursts . here </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on evaluating the event rate in variables that are most useful to observers . </S>",
    "<S> the burst at source occurs with a certain duration and flux . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed duration and flux depend on the redshift of the source . </S>",
    "<S> we transform the event rate from source variables to observer variables . </S>",
    "<S> these results will be useful in the ongoing search for radio transients at the parkes @xcite , eta @xcite , and lwa @xcite telescopes , and the new generation large radio telescopes such as lofar@xcite and ska @xcite .    </S>",
