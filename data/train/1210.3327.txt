    "the study of ultraperipheral relativistic heavy ion collisions is useful in exploring several aspects of particle and nuclear physics and is an important part of current experimental efforts at the lhc .",
    "consequently ultraperipheral collisions have been extensively discussed in the literature ( for a small sample of references , see e.g. @xcite ) for different collision systems and various photon - nucleus and photon - photon processes .    in @xcite",
    "we have considered photoproduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ultraperipheral ppb ( @xmath2 tev and ( @xmath3 tev ) and pbpb ( @xmath4 tev and ( @xmath5 tev ) collisions at the lhc .",
    "a major shortcoming was that the results were calculated to leading order ( lo ) in perturbative qcd . in this article",
    "we remedy this shortcoming and present results at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy .",
    "we also consider , as an addition to the previous treatments , photoproduction of heavy quarks in ultraperipheral pp collisions at @xmath6 tev and @xmath7 tev . as in the earlier studies",
    "an important goal is to investigate quantitatively the influence of nuclear modifications of parton distributions on observables such as cross sections and rapidity distributions and also the extent of applicability of these observables in helping to constrain components of nuclear parton distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ phothadupc ] we discuss photoproduction of heavy quarks and the basic ingredients required in our calculations , namely photon flux , photohadron cross sections , and input nuclear and photon parton distributions . in sec .",
    "[ res ] we present the results of our calculations .",
    "our conclusion is contained in sec .",
    "in general the total cross section for the photoproduction of a pair of heavy quarks ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) in ultraperipheral collisions can be expressed as a convolution of the incident photon flux , @xmath8 , with the energy - dependent photo - cross section @xmath9 , with @xmath10 denoting the photon energy and @xmath11 a proton or nucleus .",
    "thus for pp collisions we can write @xmath12 with @xmath13 the photon flux from a proton in the pp collision system and @xmath14 the energy - dependent cross section for the photoproduction of a @xmath15 pair off a proton .",
    "the factor of @xmath16 accounts for the source / target symmetry present in symmetric collisions , since each proton can act simultaneously as a source and target of photons .",
    "a similar expression holds for aa collisions with @xmath13 replaced with @xmath17 , the flux from one of the participating nuclei and @xmath18 replaced with @xmath19 , the cross section for photoproduction of a @xmath15 pair off a nucleus . in the case of pa collisions",
    "the nucleus acts preferentially as the source and the proton as the target , leading predominantly to @xmath20p processes .",
    "but there is still a non - negligible contribution from @xmath20a processes in which the proton acts as the source of photons and the nucleus as the target .",
    "thus expressions for both types of fluxes are required for pa collisions .",
    "we can thus write @xmath21 \\ , \\ , , \\label{tpaxs}\\ ] ] with @xmath17 and @xmath13 the fluxes from the nucleus and proton in the pa collision system and @xmath18 and @xmath22 the photonucleon and photonuclear cross sections respectively .",
    "manifestations of nuclear effects can be more transparently observed when rapidity distributions are considered . using the relation @xmath23",
    "the pair rapidity distribution can be expressed as @xmath24 and scales directly with the photon flux @xmath8 .",
    "thus for pa collisions , with the convention that the proton is incident from the right and the nucleus from the left , the total rapidity distribution is @xmath25_{k = k_l } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\bigg[k \\ , \\frac{dn_\\gamma^p(k)}{dk}\\ , \\sigma^{\\gamma a \\rightarrow q \\overline{q}}(k)\\bigg]_{k = k_r }   \\label{paqqhrap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) simply denote photons from the nucleus and proton respectively .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side ( @xmath20p distribution ) peaks at positive rapidities while the second term ( @xmath20a distribution ) peaks at negative rapidities .",
    "since both the fluxes and cross sections are different , the total distribution is manifestly asymmetric , and the @xmath20p term dominates due to the much larger nuclear flux @xmath17 .    the total rapidity distribution for aa collisions can likewise be written as @xmath30_{k = k_l } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\bigg[k \\",
    ", \\frac{dn_\\gamma^z(k)}{dk}\\ , \\sigma^{\\gamma a \\rightarrow q \\overline{q}}(k)\\bigg]_{k = k_r }   \\label{aaqqhrap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 and @xmath28 simply denoting photons from the nucleus incident from the left and right respectively . here",
    "the cross sections and the left / right fluxes are identical ; thus the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ aaqqhrap ] ) yields a distribution which is the mirror image of the second term .",
    "consequently the total distribution is symmetric about midrapidity ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "similar expression and symmetry attribute hold true for pp collisions .",
    "let us now consider the various photon fluxes occurring in the expressions for total cross sections and rapidity distributions .",
    "for a given impact parameter @xmath32 , the flux of virtual photons with photon energy @xmath10 , @xmath33 , is strongly dependent on the lorentz factor @xmath20 .",
    "the photon flux also depends strongly on the adiabaticity parameter @xmath34 @xcite : @xmath35 \\ , \\ , , \\label{dpf}\\ ] ] which drops off exponentially for @xmath36 , above a cutoff energy determined essentially by the size of the nucleus , @xmath37mev@xmath38 ( fm ) .    the photon flux from a proton is usually estimated using the dipole formula for the electric form factor @xcite : @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\bigg(\\ln{d } - \\frac{11}{6 } + \\frac{3}{d } - \\frac{3}{2d^2 } + \\frac{1}{3d^3}\\bigg ) \\ , \\ , , \\label{pf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 $ ] and the minimum momentum transferred @xmath41 $ ] . in the case of proton - nucleus",
    "( pa ) collisions , the flux from the proton is given by eq .",
    "( [ pf ] ) while the flux due to the nucleus ( of charge z ) can be evaluated analytically and is given by @xcite , @xmath42 \\ , \\ , ,   \\label{anaf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with reduced adiabaticity parameter , @xmath43 , given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 the effective radius of the proton .",
    "for nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions an analytic approximation similar to eq .",
    "( [ anaf ] ) can be derived .",
    "a more accurate expression for the flux can be obtained by integrating @xmath33 over impact parameters with the constraint of no hadronic interactions and accounting for the photon polarization .",
    "this yields the total photon flux @xmath46 given by @xcite , @xmath47 with @xmath48 the radius of the nucleus .      in general photon interactions with hadrons and nuclei",
    "can be classified as direct or resolved . in direct interactions the photon behave as a point - like particle while in resolved interactions the incident photon first fluctuates into a quark - antiquark state ( or an even more complex partonic configuration consisting of quarks and gluons ) which then subsequently interacts hadronically with the hadron or nuclear target .",
    "the cross section for the photoproduction of a pair of heavy quarks , @xmath49 , is therefore a sum of both the direct and resolved contributions : @xmath50 here @xmath11 stands for a proton or a nucleus ( @xmath51 ) and the total photoproduction cross section is obtained by convolution of the energy - dependent cross section @xmath52 and the equivalent photon flux , @xmath53 , as given in eq .",
    "( [ taaxs ] ) for symmetric pp ( aa ) collisions and eq .",
    "( [ tpaxs ] ) for asymmetric pa collisions .",
    "let us consider both contributions in some detail .",
    "in view of the high energies involved perturbative qcd is applicable , and both the direct and resolved contributions are expressible as convolution of the cross sections for the relevant partonic subprocesses and the corresponding nucleon / nuclear parton distributions .",
    "thus the direct contribution can be written as @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the parton - level cross section for the photoproduction of a heavy quark pair from the interaction of a photon @xmath20 and a parton @xmath56 with momentum fraction @xmath57 .",
    "the renormalization scale , @xmath58 , has been set equal to the factorization scale , @xmath59 i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the parton distribution of @xmath56 in @xmath11 evaluated at @xmath57 and @xmath62 . in addition",
    "@xmath63 denotes the square of the center - of - mass energy of the photon - nucleus ( or photon - nucleon ) system , @xmath64 that of the photon - parton system , and @xmath65 with @xmath66 the mass of the heavy quark ( charm or bottom ) .",
    "the function @xmath67 enforces a minimum ( `` threshold '' ) value of @xmath57 , @xmath68 , on the integral given by @xmath69 . note that the summation over @xmath70 involves only the light flavors , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "the resolved contribution is similar in structure to hadroproduction of heavy quarks and can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the partonic @xmath74 cross section , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) is the distribution of parton @xmath56 ( @xmath77 ) with momentum fraction @xmath57 ( @xmath78 ) in a photon ( @xmath11 ) respectively , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "similar to the direct contribution , the summation over @xmath70 involves only light quark flavors , i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "it is thus clear that the two major ingredients needed for the determination of the hadronic photoproduction cross sections are the partonic ( parton - level ) cross sections and parton distributions in nucleon / nuclei and photons .",
    "below we briefly discuss them .",
    "photon - gluon fusion is the only relevant subprocess for the direct contribution at leading order ( lo ) , and the expression for the cross section can be found in @xcite . in the case of lo",
    "resolved contribution , only the @xmath82 and @xmath83 channels are relevant , and the corresponding cross sections can be found in @xcite . we have used the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) results presented in @xcite for both direct and resolved contributions .",
    "small-@xmath84 effects ( see @xcite ) which could potentially be important for charm photoproduction are not addressed in the present study .",
    "these effects should be somewhat lessened in the case of the resolved contribution due to the inherent small-@xmath84 cutoff ( @xmath85 ) present in the photon parton distributions used in this work .",
    "we now turn to the consideration of the parton distributions ( pds ) relevant to the processes considered in the present study .",
    "while the direct contribution to the photoproduction of heavy quarks requires the distributions of light quarks / antiquarks and gluons in protons and nuclei , the resolved contribution , in addition , requires these distributions in photons also .",
    "thus in addition to the usual requirement of nucleon and nuclear parton distributions ( npds ) , there is also the need for the relatively poorly known parton distributions in photons ( @xmath20pds ) , thereby increasing the level of the theoretical uncertainties in the calculation of photoproduction of heavy quarks .",
    "let us first discuss nuclear parton distributions .",
    "it is rather well - known that the distributions of partons ( i.e. quarks and gluons ) in nuclei are quite different from the distributions in free nucleons , that is , they are `` modified '' by the complex , many - body effects in the nucleus .",
    "these nuclear effects are usually parametrized in terms of `` nuclear modifications '' @xmath86 which in general depend on the parton specie ( @xmath56 ) , the nucleus ( @xmath87 ) , momentum fraction @xmath84 and scale @xmath62 . the nuclear effects can be categorized based on different intervals in @xmath84 . at small values of @xmath84 ( @xmath88 )",
    ", we have the phenomenon generally referred to as shadowing .",
    "this is a depletion , in the sense that in this interval , the distribution of a parton @xmath56 in the nucleus is smaller compared to the corresponding distribution in a free proton , i.e. @xmath89 . antishadowing , which is an enhancement ( @xmath90 ) , occurs in the range @xmath91 .",
    "another depletion , the classic emc effect @xcite , is present in the interval @xmath92 , while for @xmath93 , the fermi motion region , we have another enhancement .",
    "it is important to note that although both shadowing and the emc effect ( antishadowing and fermi motion ) correspond to depletion ( enhancement ) , the physical principles and mechanisms governing these phenomena are quite different .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite with the knowledge of @xmath86 , nuclear parton distributions can be expressed as a convolution of free nucleon parton distributions and nuclear modifications , i.e. @xmath94 .    while the determination of quark and antiquark distributions in nucleons and nuclei is in general a nontrivial task , that of gluons is even more problematic .",
    "gluons are electrically neutral , and thus their distributions can not be extracted directly from deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan ( dy ) processes which account for the major part of the data used in global fits .",
    "their distributions are in general inferred from sum rules and the @xmath62 evolution of sea quarks distributions .",
    "the situation is even worse in the nuclear case : the available data is much less than for nucleons , and there is the added complication of a mass dependence .",
    "it is therefore not unusual for nuclear gluon distributions from different global fits to differ significantly , especially in the magnitude of the various nuclear effects ( shadowing , antishadowing , etc ) .",
    "this is especially obvious at low @xmath62 ( i.e. around their initial starting scales ) since evolution to high @xmath62 tends to lessen the differences .",
    "earlier global analyses @xcite relied heavily on fixed - target nuclear deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan ( dy ) lepton - pair production data .",
    "incorporation of additional data from inclusive hadron production in deuteron - gold collisions and neutrino - iron processes has been implemented in @xcite .",
    "the approach in @xcite utilizes the gribov picture of shadowing and data from diffractive processes to generate nuclear modifications . despite all these advances",
    "the nuclear gluon distribution is still currently the least constrained aspect of nuclear parton distributions , as significant uncertainties still persist at both small and large @xmath84 .",
    "three recent nucleon / nuclear parton distributions are utilized in the present study . for the proton we use the martin - stirling - thorne - watts ( mstw08 ) parton distributions @xcite which are available up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . in the nuclear case we use two nuclear modification sets : the nlo set by eskola , paukunnen , and salgado ( eps09 ) @xcite and the nlo set by frankfurt , guzey , and strikman ( fgs10 ) @xcite .",
    "for eps09 we use the central fit while for fgs10 we use the strong gluon shadowing model ( fgs10_h ) . the distributions from mstw08 serve two purposes : as the free nucleon distributions used in conjunction with nuclear modifications , and also as a `` special '' nuclear distribution in the absence of nuclear effects .",
    "the latter case is particularly useful for highlighting the influence of the various nuclear effects on observables .",
    "it is instructive to compare the characteristics of the light partons and gluon distributions from both eps09 and fgs10 sets based on the strength of their nuclear modifications . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfpb ] we show the nuclear modifications for light quarks and gluons in pb , @xmath95 from eps09 and fgs10 at the factorization scale @xmath96 .",

    "both @xmath109 and @xmath108 are less shadowed in fgs10 than in eps09 for the entire shadowing interval ( @xmath110 versus @xmath111 at very small @xmath84 ) . in the case of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the emc and fermi motion effects which are present in eps09 are virtually absent in fgs10 .",
    "the shadowing components are not very different , with fgs10 being slightly more shadowed at very small @xmath84 , and eps09 more shadowed for @xmath114 . in fgs10 strange quarks ( antiquarks ) are more shadowed but there is an absence of emc and fermi motion characteristics which are present in eps09 . by far the most impressive difference",
    "occurs in the shadowing of the gluon sector : the gluon shadowing in eps09 is almost constant at small @xmath84 at @xmath115 while in fgs10 the shadowing increases with decreasing @xmath84 , reaching a value of about @xmath116 at @xmath117 . while eps09 exhibits both emc and fermi motion effects these are absent in fgs10 .",
    "also the antishadowing component is smaller in fgs10 than in eps09 .",
    "thus in the shadowing regime it is reasonable to expect that much of the differences in the predictions from eps09 and fgs10 stem from their radically different gluon characteristics .",
    "parton distributions in photons ( @xmath20pds ) are derived from experimentally determined photon structure function @xmath118 , in conjunction with appreciable theoretical inputs .",
    "these inputs , which are necessary in implementing the parametrization of photon parton distributions from the structure function , account in part for some of the observable differences in the available photon parton distribution sets .",
    "another source of differences is in the choice and scope of experimental data from which @xmath119 is extracted . at present",
    "there is an appreciable number of photon parton distribution sets available , both at leading and next - to - leading orders @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that unlike in the case of a nucleon , there are no valence quarks present in the photon ; therefore antiquark distributions are the same as quark distributions .",
    "furthermore , there are no sum rules governing the gluon content ; thus the gluon distribution is almost totally unconstrained .",
    "the gluon distribution contributes to @xmath118 majorly through the @xmath120 channel , which has significant numerical support only at small @xmath84 .",
    "two recent nlo photon parton distributions are the set by cornet , jankowski , and krawczyk ( cjk04 ) @xcite and that by aurenche , fontannaz , and guillet ( afg04 ) @xcite .",
    "the cjk04 set uses the dis renormalization scheme while the msbar scheme is employed in afg04 .",
    "we have used the afg04 set ( afg04_bf ) in the present study for consistency with the renormalization scheme used in @xcite for the nlo cross sections used in this work . in fig .",

    "the most remarkable characteristic is the dramatic rise of @xmath123 with decreasing @xmath84 .",
    "we now discuss the results of our calculations for the inclusive photoproduction of heavy quarks ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) in ultraperipheral proton - proton ( pp ) , proton - lead ( ppb ) , and lead - lead ( pbpb ) collisions at the lhc .",

    "the sensitivity to nuclear modifications , while more appreciable here than in ppb collisions , is significantly less than for the equivalent @xmath0 production . at @xmath4 tev the resolved components are @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 respectively for mstw08 , eps09 , and fgs10 distribution sets . thus to a good approximation the resolved component can be taken as @xmath139 for all three parton distribution sets .",
    "it is noteworthy that unlike what obtains in @xmath0 production at this energy , both the direct and resolved components from eps09 are the largest .",
    "in addition the resolved component from fgs10 is also larger than that of mstw08 .",
    "this is due to the increasingly important role of antishadowing at this energy .",
    "thus the eps09 total cross section is @xmath140 larger than that of mstw08 . due to the stronger shadowing and smaller antishadowing in fgs10 , the total cross section is approximately @xmath141 smaller .    at @xmath5",

    "while the influence of shadowing can be seen in the direct components , both eps09 and fgs10 yield larger resolved components , again due to antishadowing .",

    "these features are also present in the distributions at @xmath5 tev . here also the clear influence of shadowing in the rapidity interval @xmath150 in the direct component is reduced by the antishadowing present in the resolved component in the same interval .",
    "thus the total rapidity distribution exhibit reduced sensitivity to nuclear shadowing in this interval due to this destructive interference .",
    "nevertheless the influence of shadowing is still apparent especially in the rapidity window @xmath147 .",
    "thus this interval presents the best sensitivity to shadowing effects in @xmath1 production .",
    "as at the lower energy , there is a slight manifestation of antishadowing in the intervals @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "let us now consider the magnitude of the change in cross section with energy .",

    "these values are larger , especially for @xmath156 than obtained for both pp and ppb collisions .      from a consideration of the general structure of the quantities ( cross sections and rapidity distributions ) considered in this study ,",

    "is to compare photoproduction in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions , where many theoretical uncertainties and systematic errors cancel ( see for instance @xcite ) . here",
    "we explore in a rather simplistic and nonrigorous manner such an approach for shadowing effects in @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction .",

    "it should be noted that in our calculations equal rapidity corresponds to equal photon energy .",
    "let us compare the shadowing effects from these ratios at a specific rapidity , say at @xmath31 .",
    "thus for @xmath0 the mstw08 value is reduced by approximately @xmath162 and @xmath163 respectively by the shadowing in eps09 and fgs10 .",
    "these reductions are precisely what one obtains from the rapidity distributions of @xmath0 in pbpb collisions at @xmath5 tev .",
    "this is also true for @xmath1 where the ratio reduction values @xmath164",
    "( eps09 ) and @xmath165 ( fgs10 ) are the same as from the rapidity distributions .",
    "it thus seems feasible , at least in this simplistic case , that relative shadowing effects are transmitted without appreciable loss .",
    "of course , in order to ascertain to what degree higher order effects are cancelled in these ratios , one should carry out the analogous calculations at leading order .",
    "further work along this line is in progress .",
    "in the present study we have considered next - to - leading order ( nlo ) photoproduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ultraperipheral proton - proton ( pp ) , proton - lead ( ppb ) and lead - lead ( pbpb ) collisions at lhc .",
    "in addition to its value in probing several aspects of qcd dynamics , photoproduction of heavy quarks can also aid in elucidating and constraining some components of nuclear parton distributions .",
    "although the parton distribution dependence is linear and different modifications are superimposed due to the integration over parton momentum fraction @xmath84 , both cross sections and rapidity distributions for @xmath0 in pbpb collisions manifest appreciable sensitivity to shadowing around midrapidity and a slight sensitivity to antishadowing at more forward and backward rapidities . thus @xmath0 photoproduction offers good constraining potential for shadowing , and a somewhat less potential for antishadowing . despite the fact that photoproduction of @xmath1 is less sensitive to nuclear modifications than @xmath0 , the influence of shadowing is evident around midrapidity , and it thus offers some constraining ability for shadowing . both @xmath0 and @xmath1 total photoproduction cross sections and rapidity distributions in ppb collisions show little sensitivity to nuclear modifications and are therefore useful in shadowing determination via cross section ratios .",

    "<S> photoproduction of heavy quarks in ultraperipheral collisions can help elucidate important features of the physics of heavy quarks in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . due to the dependence on parton distributions it can </S>",
    "<S> also potentially offer some constraining ability in the determination of nuclear parton distributions . in the present study we consider next - to - leading order ( nlo ) photoproduction of heavy quarks in ultraperipheral proton - proton ( pp ) , proton - nucleus ( pa ) , and nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> total cross sections and rapidity distributions are considered and the influence of nuclear modifications of parton distributions on these quantities are explored for pa and aa collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that photoproduction of heavy quarks in pbpb collisions exhibit significant sensitivity to nuclear effects , and in conjunction with photoproduction in ppb collisions , affords good constraining potential for gluon shadowing determination . </S>"
