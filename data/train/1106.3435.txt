    "the x - ray appearance of most nearby ( @xmath6 mpc ) galaxies is determined by bright x - ray binaries @xcite , such as high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) and low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "because of their high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath7 ) notable fraction of them can be resolved with moderately deep _",
    "chandra _ exposures , and hence hence they can be studied in full particulars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "underneath bright x - ray binaries diffuse emission is present in all types of galaxies .",
    "similarly to the galactic ridge x - ray emission @xcite , a part of this emission originates from the collective emission of faint ( @xmath8 ) compact x - ray sources , mostly from active binaries ( abs ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , young stars , and young stellar objects ( ysos ) . based on the analysis of a few nearby early - type galaxies ,",
    "it was suggested that the overall luminosity of abs and cvs is tightly correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , in all types of galaxies truly diffuse emission from warm ( @xmath9 kev ) ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) is also present , whose measure , among others , depends on the mass of the host galaxy , albeit with large dispersion @xcite .",
    "the total observed unresolved emission is the combination of these , and possibly other , components .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     _ note .",
    "_ columns are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) contamination subtracted @xmath0 ratios in the @xmath1 kev energy range . ( 2 )",
    "total k - band luminosity from the 2mass archive .",
    "( 3 ) references are : @xmath10 @xcite ",

    "( 5 ) radial velocity relative to m87 . ( 6 ) distance from m87 .",
    "( 7 ) globular cluster specific frequency .",
    "refererences are : @xmath14 @xcite ",
    "[ tab : list3 ]      main parameters of the virgo galaxies are summarized in table [ tab : list3 ] , listing their @xmath0 ratio , k - band luminosity , age , stellar velocity dispersion , radial velocity with respect to m87 , offset from the center of m87 , and globular cluster ( gc ) specific frequency .",
    "we use m87 to characterize the position and velocity of the galaxy with respect to the intracluster medium . from the table ,",
    "one may conclude that galaxies with anomalous @xmath0 ratios have several common properties : ( i ) are members of the virgo cluster of galaxies ; ( ii ) are massive , their total k - band luminosities are in the range of @xmath16 ; ( iii ) have relatively small velocity with respect to the intracluster gas @xmath17 km / s ; ( iv ) are old , with the stellar age in the @xmath18 gyrs range @xcite .",
    "based on our , admittedly limited , sample , it appears that each of these properties is essential .",
    "indeed , the following galaxies , missing one of the above properties , have perfectly normal @xmath0 ratios : ( i ) a similarly massive and old virgo galaxy m89 , but having a large radial velocity with respect to m87 , @xmath19 km / s ; ( ii ) a massive field galaxy ngc3585 with a total mass of @xmath20 and relatively young age ; ( iii ) two massive , @xmath21 , but apparently young virgo galaxies ngc4365 and ngc4526 with the age of 3.6 and 1.7 gyrs , respectively @xcite , one of them having small ( @xmath22 km / s ) and the other large ( @xmath23 km / s ) velocity .",
    "interestingly , there seems to be no dependence on the radial distance from the center of virgo cluster , which may be explained by the somewhat irregular spatial distribution of its intracluster gas .    as one can see from the table [ tab : list3 ] , the four galaxies with anomalously high @xmath0 ratios have the highest values of the globular clusters specific frequency .",
    "therefore their lmxb populations have a larger contribution of x - ray binaries formed dynamically in globular clusters , which could , hypothetically , result in enhanced x - ray luminosity in the hard band , due to unaccounted contribution of faint sources formed in globular clusters .",
    "this is further discussed in the section [ sec : faint_src ] ) and it is shown that gc sources can not explain the anomalous hard emission .    because of the limited size of our sample , it is unclear , whether the observations presented above reflect true properties or are a result of a chance coincidence . with this in mind , we proceed with the discussion of various mechanisms which may be responsible for the excess hard emission .      in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : allspec ] we show the energy spectra of all studied galaxies combined in three groups : 1 ) the galaxies showing anomalous @xmath0 ratios  m49 , m60 , m84 , and ngc4636 , 2 ) all remaining early - type galaxies and 3 ) all late - type galaxies .",
    "to facilitate comparison , the spectra are normalized to @xmath24 and are projected to the distance of @xmath25 mpc .",
    "firstly , fig .",
    "[ fig : allspec ] shows that at every energy the spectra of the `` anomalous '' ellipticals is higher by @xmath26 orders of magnitude .",
    "secondly , it is obvious that the enhanced hard @xmath0 ratios are not a result of the soft component `` leaking '' into the @xmath1 kev band .",
    "instead , it requires an additional hard component in the spectrum .",
    "such a component , if of thermal origin , should have a temperature of about @xmath27 kev , as illustrated by the right - hand panel in fig.[fig : allspec ] .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with a model consisting of two mekal models and a power law component .",
    "the latter accounts for the population of unresolved lmxbs and has the slope fixed at @xmath28 , and the normalization fixed at the value corresponding to the estimated luminosity from unresolved lmxbs .",
    "the best - fit temperatures of the thermal components are @xmath29 kev and @xmath30 kev .",
    "the hotter component can be replaced by a power law with the photon index of @xmath31 , giving similar fit quality . in both models ,",
    "the fit is statistically unacceptable , mainly because of the poor approximation at low energies , indicating that the spectrum of the soft component is more complex .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of unresolved emission are presented in fig [ fig : profiles ] . in the left four panels we show for each galaxy the soft and hard band profiles along with the k - band light distribution .",
    "the contribution of the warm ism emission and unresolved lmxbs are subtracted from the hard band profiles .",
    "the emission from the former was computed from the soft band profiles using the best fit temperature of the soft component from table [ tab : list2 ] .",
    "the emission from unresolved lmxbs was calculated from the k - band light distribution , the normalizations were determined as described in sect . [ sec : xraybin ] .",
    "the amplitude of these two main contaminating factors is investigated in the right hand panels , where we show the total hard band emission , before subtracting ism and lmxb contributions ( but instrumental and cosmic background removed ) and the distributions of hard band emission from ism and unresolved lmxbs .    as one can see from the right hand panels , the hard band emission exceeds by a factor of about @xmath32 the level of contamination ( except for m84 where unresolved lmxbs contribute @xmath33@xmath34 of the total emission in the hard band ) .",
    "this is much larger than the possible uncertainty in their determination .",
    "this confirms that the observed anomalous hard x - ray emission is not the result of these contaminating factors .",
    "we remind that the contribution of ism and unresolved lmxbs is subtracted from the hard band luminosities plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lxlk ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : early_virgo ] .",
    "although there are some differences between the two distributions , the soft and hard band emissions have roughly the same spatial extent , approximately similar to the spatial extent of the k - band emission .",
    "the best fit temperature of the hard component , @xmath35 kev is close to the temperature of the intracluster gas in virgo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the excess emission may be due to intracluster gas accreted into the gravitational potential of a massive galaxy ( e.g. * ?",
    "this interpretation is qualitatively consistent with the four abovementioned properties of the galaxies with anomalous hard emission . indeed ,",
    "( i ) such mechanism can work only for galaxies located in clusters ; ( ii ) galaxies must be sufficiently massive to confine the @xmath33@xmath27 kev gas ; ( iii ) galaxies should move sufficiently slowly with respect to the gas ; ( iv ) some time is needed in order to accrete sufficiently massive x - ray halo .",
    "one of the major facts , of such interpretation would have to explain , is the short cooling time of the gas .",
    "given the gas density and temperature determined from the spectral fits , its cooling time inside 1 kpc does not exceed @xmath36@xmath37 gyr in any of the four galaxies .",
    "another difficulty of this interpretation is the nearly identical radial profiles in the soft and hard bands .",
    "indeed , in the hydrostatic equilibrium , the hotter gas component is expected to have broader spatial distribution than the cooler one , as the scale heights for gas with @xmath38@xmath39 kev and @xmath40@xmath41 kev are by factors of @xmath33@xmath42 different .",
    "this , however , is not observed  the soft and hard band emission appear to fill the same volume .",
    "on the other hand , the ism may have a complex multiphase thermal structure , with gas of different temperatures present at all radii .",
    "existence of such multiphase ism in massive elliptical galaxies has been proposed , for example , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "based on x - ray spectroscopy of ngc1399 and ngc5044 they suggested that these galaxies host multiphase ism .",
    "the temperature of the cooler component was found to be @xmath43 kev , whereas the temperature of the hotter component was consistent with the intracluster medium ( icm ) temperature , i.e. similar to our results .",
    "it remains to be seen , whether accretion of hot icm can explain anomalous hard emission from the four massive galaxies .",
    "a major advance in testing this hypothesis can be achieved by means of high resolution x - ray spectroscopy .      in principle , it is possible that the hard emission is due to an enhanced population of faint stellar sources , such as abs and cvs .",
    "this would explain the hard spectrum of the excess emission , consistent with the power law with the photon index of @xmath44@xmath45 and the fact that hard band profiles approximately follow the distribution of the k - band light .",
    "although this assumption can not be ruled out entirely , we stress that the numbers of resolved lmxbs in these galaxies are in very good agreement with the prediction based on the average scaling relations for lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the stellar ages of the galaxies under consideration are also entirely normal for elliptical galaxies . for these reasons",
    ", it seems implausible that in these galaxies the ratio of @xmath46 is @xmath47 times higher than in other early - type galaxies from our sample .",
    "the high specific frequency of globular clusters ( gcs ) observed in m49 , m60 , m84 , and ngc4636 may suggest , that the excess hard band emission could be due to unaccounted contribution of undetected faint sources in gcs .",
    "these sources may be undetected , but relatively luminous lmxbs , whose luminosities fall just below the _ chandra _ source detection threshold , as well as much fainter sources with luminosities in the @xmath48 range ( cvs , quiescent lmxbs , millisecond pulsars etc )",
    ". this , however , does not seem to be a viable possibility for the following reasons .",
    "the method of the xlf renormalization is based on the numbers of all observed bright lmxbs , irrespective of their association with gcs .",
    "therefore the possibly enhanced specific frequency of lmxbs in these galaxies , due to the contribution of systems dynamically formed in gcs , is automatically taken into account by this procedure and is included in the calculation of the luminosity of unresolved lmxbs .",
    "in fact , the shapes of the luminosity functions of field and gc lmxbs are markedly different : in the latter the fraction of faint sources ( @xmath49 ) is @xmath36@xmath50 times smaller @xcite .",
    "therefore this procedure may slightly oversubtract the contribution of undetected gc lmxbs .",
    "it is also worth to note that the specific frequency of resolved x - ray binaries in these galaxies is not much different , within a factor of @xmath33@xmath51 , from other galaxies in our sample , which fact speaks against significantly enhanced population of ( bright ) x - ray binaries .",
    "the possibly enhanced population of faint sources ( @xmath52 ) can not be measured directly in external galaxies but their contribution can be constrained . from _",
    "_ observations of gcs in the milky way , the total luminosity of faint sources even in those of them with the largest encounter rates , e.g. ngc6440 and 47 tuc @xcite does not exceed @xmath53 erg / s .",
    "the latter number was obtained by integrating the luminosity functions of faint sources in ngc6440 @xcite and in 47 tuc @xcite and refers to the @xmath54 kev band .",
    "the numbers of globular clusters in massive ellipticals is @xmath55 , therefore their total luminosity in the soft band does not exceed @xmath33@xmath56 erg / s .",
    "the soft - to - hard band ratios for faint globular cluster sources are in the @xmath33@xmath57 range , but brighter sources tend to have softer spectra @xcite .",
    "thus an upper limit on the hard band luminosity is in the @xmath36@xmath58 erg / s range .",
    "this is about @xmath42 orders of magnitude smaller than the hard band excess luminosity detected in galaxies under consideration , @xmath33@xmath59 erg / s .",
    "an even much less likely possibility is that the enhanced x - ray emission is due to population of young starts and yso .",
    "using the scaling relation @xmath4sfr@xmath60 obtained in sect .",
    "[ sec : latetype ] we conclude that a star - formation rate of @xmath61/yr is required in order to maintain @xmath62 kev luminosity of @xmath63 ( table [ tab : list2 ] ) .",
    "this values are appropriate for intensely star - forming galaxies and are unrealistic for ellipticals of @xmath64 gyrs age @xcite .",
    "we investigated the properties of unresolved x - ray emission in a broad sample of nearby early - type and late - type galaxies based on archival _ chandra _ data . after removing the contribution of resolved and unresolved x - ray binaries we measured @xmath0 ratios in the @xmath65 kev and @xmath1 kev bands and compared them with the solar neighborhood values . complementing this data with the spectral and spatial information we concluded that the unresolved x - ray emission originates from , at least , four distinct components .    1 .   the population of faint unresolved sources associated with old stellar population . based on the data for elliptical galaxies we obtained a scaling relation for its @xmath62 kev luminosity : @xmath66 with the rms@xmath67 , which number is in excellent agreement with the value obtained by @xcite for the solar neighborhood .",
    "the @xmath0 for the soft band and for the late - type galaxies can not be determined unambiguously because of the contribution of ism and young stellar sources . for three low - mass gas poor ellipticals we obtained in the soft band @xmath44@xmath68 , which is by a factor of @xmath33@xmath27 smaller than the solar neighborhood value .",
    "2 .   in all galaxies , warm ism with the temperature in the @xmath69 kev range",
    "is present . in our sample ,",
    "the gas temperatures in late - type galaxies tend to be lower than in early - types galaxies of the same mass .",
    "similar to the results found in previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the amount and luminosity of the gas generally scales with the stellar mass of the host galaxy , albeit with the large scatter . the scale factor and",
    "the scatter appear to increase with the mass of the galaxy .",
    "3 .   the population of unresolved young stars and ysos in late - type galaxies .",
    "the x - ray emission of this component approximately scales with the sfr of the host galaxy with the average @xmath4sfr@xmath70 .",
    "the most unexpected result of our study is the detection of anomalous emission in the @xmath1 kev band from four old and massive virgo ellipticals ( m49 , m60 , m84 , ngc4636 ) .",
    "we could not offer an unambiguous explanation of this emission",
    ". a plausible interpretation may be that it is a result of accretion of the intracluster gas in the gravitational potential of the massive galaxy . in this scenario , the two component spectra on one hand and the similarity of surface brightness profiles on the other ,",
    "would point at the multiphase nature of ism in these galaxies .",
    "high resolution x - ray spectroscopy may shed further light on the origin of the anomalous emission .",
