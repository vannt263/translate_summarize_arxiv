    "the experimental and theoretical investigation of @xmath0 lepton decays has received continuous attention since the @xmath0 has been discovered nearly twenty years ago . branching ratios and distributions of the dominant modes",
    "are now determined with a precision of a few permill , posing a serious challenge for a refined theoretical treatment .",
    "the purely leptonic decay rates can be evaluated from first principles , providing thus a convenient calibration .",
    "the decay rate @xmath1 can be predicted using the measured decay rate of the pion as input .",
    "uncertainties arise at the permille level and are induced through the model dependence of radiative corrections .",
    "cvc allows to relate vector current decays e.g. into two or four pions to the corresponding cross sections measured in electron positron collisions .",
    "however , already now this approach is limited by the error of the input data . in the case of the two pion mode , the @xmath0 decay rate with a relative error below one % is already now about a factor five more precise than the predictions based on @xmath2 . for the remaining modes , induced by the axial current or by cabibbo suppressed channels ,",
    "a variety of theoretical assumptions must be employed , based on symmetry relations between different amplitudes which can be derived from isospin or @xmath3 , or on dynamical constraints deduced from chiral lagrangians at small momentum transfer . to saturate the form factors in the region of large @xmath4 by resonances with momentum independent coupling",
    "is a natural choice in the context of the vector dominance model ( vdm ) but perhaps the most problematic assumption , which has to be tested by measurements of differential distributions . a particular powerful tool is provided by the analyses of angular distributions .",
    "the relevant information is conveniently encoded in structure functions@xcite which , in turn , allow to reconstruct the form factors .",
    "@xmath0 decays are therefore a unique tool to study hadron physics in the low momentum region in order to test a variety of theoretical approaches and to derive resonance parameters which are not accessible elsewhere . an improved description of the hadronic matrix elements allows , furthermore , to exploit all ( or at least most ) channels for an analysis of the @xmath0 polarization @xmath5 in @xmath6 decays",
    ". decays into a pion have been employed for this purpose from the very beginning ; as a consequence of the improved understanding of the relevant distributions two and three pion modes are now equally important for the analysis .",
    "since all multi - pion modes have equal ( and maximal ) analyzing power once the decay matrix element is known@xcite this is clearly a worthwhile aim .",
    "another reason to improve the theoretical description of @xmath0 production and decay is the search for new physics .",
    "subtle deviations from the standard model like the influence of a charged higgs boson on the question of universality could be amplified by the masses of the fermion involved in the reaction@xcite .",
    "last not least : only a steady improvement of the theoretical understanding allows to develop the monte carlo program tauola@xcite , which is used to simulate @xmath0 decays in    practically all @xmath7 experiments at lep , slc and cesr .    in this contribution",
    "a variety of topics and recent developments will be treated . in section 2 the formalism for the relation between form factors and structure functions and",
    "the transition to angular distributions will be reviewed@xcite and the basic assumptions inherent in the theoretical models used to predict multimeson amplitudes will be presented@xcite . in section 3 predictions for final states involving one or",
    "several kaons will be discussed , with emphasis on a recent update@xcite of the theoretical predictions .",
    "four pion modes will be discussed in section 4 , which is based on ref .  [ 7 ] .",
    "radiative corrections@xcite to @xmath8 will be discussed in the last , fifth section of this review . @xmath9",
    "the hadronic current @xmath10 is built up from the momenta of the mesons .",
    "for the three meson state it is characterized by four independent form factors .",
    "a convenient choice reads as follows@xcite @xmath11          \\nonumber\\\\     & & + \\,\\,i\\ ,    \\epsilon^{\\mu\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}q_{1\\,\\alpha}q_{2\\,\\beta}q_{3\\,\\gamma}\\,f_3    + q^\\mu\\,f_4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 and @xmath13 determine the spin one component of the axial current induced amplitude , @xmath14 the spin zero part which is obviously given by the matrix element of the divergence of the axial current . the vector current induced amplitude is responsible for the formfactor @xmath15 .",
    "all form factors may contribute in the general three meson case .",
    "the three pion case , however , allows for significant simplifications .",

    "instead of 16 independent real functions which characterize the general hadronic tensor @xmath19 one thus deals with four functions of @xmath20 only .",
    "a convenient basis has been found in ref .  [ 1 ] which is related to the form factors in a straightforward way . in the three pion rest frame , and with the @xmath21 coordinates alligned with the @xmath22 plane ( see fig .  1 ) , these four `` structure functions '' are given by @xmath23                                     \\nonumber \\\\",

    "a rich variety of final states has become accessible recently with improved particle identification : modes with one or two kaons have been analyzed and even the three kaon final state is kinematically accessible in @xmath0 decays .",

    "a number of additional complications do however arise : the form factor @xmath51 vanishes in the soft meson limit for @xmath52 . on the other hand",
