    "when we study properties of a given quantum field theory ( qft ) , it is common to first investigate behaviors of correlation functions of local operators in the theory .",
    "however , properties of non - local quantities are equally important , especially for understanding of its quantum mechanical phase structure .",
    "one basic such example of non - local physical quantities is the wilson loop operators in gauge theories , which is a very useful order parameter of confinement .    in a more generic class of qfts",
    ", we can instead consider a quantity called entanglement entropy ( or geometric entropy ) .",
    "this is defined as the von neumann entropy @xmath6 when we ` trace out ' ( or smear out ) degrees of freedom inside a @xmath7-dimensional space - like submanifold @xmath8 in a given @xmath9 dimensional qft .",
    "its complement is denoted by the submanifold @xmath10 .",
    "it measures how a given quantum system is entangled or strongly correlated .",
    "intuitively we can also say that this is the entropy for an observer in @xmath10 who is not accessible to @xmath8 as the information is lost by the smearing out in region @xmath8 .",
    "as its name suggests , we expect that the entanglement entropy is directly related to the degrees of freedom . indeed , the entanglement entropy is proportional to the central charge in two dimensional conformal field theories ( 2d cfts ) as first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "recently , this property was also confirmed in @xcite in which a general prescription of computing the entropy in 2d cfts is given .",
    "also in the mass perturbed cfts ( massive qfts ) the same conclusion holds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as we will discuss later , the similar statement is also true in 4d cfts .",
    "the entropy is related to the 4d central charges .    in higher dimensional ( more than two dimensional ) qfts , it is not easy to compute the entanglement entropy for arbitrary submanifolds @xmath10 even in free field theories .",
    "motivated by this , we would like to consider a holographic estimation of the quantity by applying ads / cft correspondence ( or duality ) @xcite .",
    "we can find pioneering works @xcite that discuss related issues from slightly different viewpoints .",
    "recently , the authors of the present paper proposed a holographic computation of entanglement entropy in cfts from the ads / cft @xcite .",
    "this reduces the complicated quantum calculation in qfts to a classical differential geometrical computation .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence relates a @xmath11 dimensional ads space ( ads@xmath12 ) to a @xmath9 dimensional cft ( cft@xmath13 ) , which is sitting at the boundary of the ads@xmath12 .",
    "the claim is that the entropy @xmath6 in a @xmath9 dimensional cft can be determined from the @xmath7 dimensional minimal surface @xmath14 whose boundary is given by the @xmath15 dimensional manifold @xmath16 .",
    "the entropy is given by applying the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula to the area of the minimal surface @xmath14 as if @xmath14 were an event horizon .",
    "this is motivated by the idea of the entropy bound @xcite and by the similarity between the black hole horizons and the minimal surface @xmath14 .",
    "they become equivalent in the special cases such as those in ads black holes @xcite and in black holes of brane - world @xcite , as the minimal surfaces wrap the horizons ( see also @xcite for earlier related discussions ) . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that our proposal , when applied to the lowest dimensional ads@xmath0cft@xmath1 example , correctly reproduces the known results of entanglement entropy in 2d cft .",
    "also it is easy to see that the bekenstein - hawking like formula is consistent with the known ` area law ' in entanglement entropy @xcite for the cfts ( also qfts ) in any dimensions .    in the present paper",
    "we would like to study the entanglement entropy in higher dimensional cfts , especially cft@xmath17 from both the cft and gravity sides .",
    "in particular , we find the computations of the logarithmic term from both sides agree at least when the second fundamental form of @xmath18 embedded in the @xmath7 dimensional space vanishes .",
    "in addition , we present a review of the required knowledge of the entanglement entropy in conformal field theories and the details of our short report .",
    "we would also like to mention recent interests in entanglement entropy in condensed matter physics .",
    "one of main foci in modern condensed matter physics is to understand quantum phases of matter which are beyond the ginzburg - landau paradigm .",
    "many - body wavefunctions of quantum ground states in these phases look featureless when one looks at correlation functions of local operators ; they can not be characterized by classical order parameters of some kind .",
    "indeed , they should be distinguished by their pattern of entanglement rather than their pattern of symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "thus , the entanglement entropy is potentially useful to characterize these exotic phases .",
    "indeed , this idea has been pushed extensively in recent couple of years for several 1d quantum systems .",
    "it has been revealed that several quantum phases in 1d spin chains , including haldane phases , can be distinguished by different scaling of the entanglement entropy .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and references in @xcite .    for higher dimensional condensed matter systems ,",
    "there has been not many works in this direction yet .",
    "recently , the entanglement entropy was applied for so - called topological phases in 2 + 1 d @xcite .",
    "typically , these phases have a finite gap and are accompanied by many exotic features such as fractionalization of quantum numbers , non - abelian statistics of quasi - particles , topological degeneracy , etc .",
    "they can be also useful fault tolerant quantum computations .",
    "on the other hand , unconventional quantum liquid phases with gapless excitations , such as gapless spin liquid phases , seem to be , at least at present , more difficult to characterize in higher dimensions .",
    "our results from ads / cft correspondence can be useful to study these gapless spin liquid states ( some of these phases have been suspected to be described by a relativistic gauge field theory of some sort @xcite ) .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section [ basics ]",
    "we present a review of definition and basic properties of entanglement entropy .",
    "section [ 2d cft ] is devoted to computations of entanglement entropy in 2d cfts . in section [ ( d+1)d cft ]",
    "we first summarize the known facts on entanglement entropy in higher dimensional cfts and perform explicit computations especially for 4d cfts .",
    "next we relate the central charges in a given 4d cft to its entanglement entropy . in section [ holographic ]",
    "we present our proposal of holographic computations of entanglement entropy from ads / cft .",
    "we also give an explicit proof of this claim in ads@xmath0cft@xmath1 based on the well - known relation @xcite and discuss its extension to higher dimensional cases .",
    "based on our proposal , in section [ ads3/cft2 ] , we compute the entanglement entropy in 2d cfts from the ads@xmath19 side and find agreements .",
    "higher dimensional cases are considered in section [ ads d+2/cft d+1 ] where we compute the entropy from the analysis of ads@xmath12 spaces . we compare it with the cft results especially for ads@xmath20cft@xmath17 case and find an agreement under a specific condition for simplification .",
    "we also estimate entanglement entropy in massive or non - conformal theories . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we summarize our results and discuss future problems .",
    "we start with a review of basic ideas and properties of entanglement entropy .      consider a quantum mechanical system with many degrees of freedom such as spin chains .",
    "more generally , we can consider arbitrary lattice models or qfts including cfts .",
    "we put the system at zero temperature and then the total quantum system is described by the pure ground state @xmath21 .",
    "we assume no degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "then , the density matrix is that of the pure state _ tot=|| .",
    "[ pure]the von neumann entropy of the total system is clearly zero @xmath22 .",
    "next we divide the total system into two subsystems @xmath10 and @xmath8 . in the spin chain example",
    ", we just artificially cut off the chain at some point and divide the lattice points into two groups . notice",
    "that physically we do not do anything to the system and the cutting procedure is an imaginary process .",
    "accordingly the total hilbert space can be written as a direct product of two spaces @xmath23 corresponding to those of subsystems @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "the observer who is only accessible to the subsystem @xmath10 will feel as if the total system is described by the reduced density matrix @xmath24 _ a= _ b  _ tot , where the trace is taken only over the hilbert space @xmath25 .",
    "now we define the entanglement entropy of the subsystem @xmath10 as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath24 @xmath26 this quantity provides us with a convenient way to measure how closely entangled ( or how `` quantum '' ) a given wave function @xmath27 is .",
    "notice also that in time - dependent backgrounds the density matrix @xmath28 and @xmath24 are time dependent as dictated by the von neumann equation .",
    "thus we need to specify the time @xmath29 when we measure the entropy . in this paper , we always study static systems and we can neglect this issue .",
    "it is also possible to define the entanglement entropy @xmath30 at finite temperature @xmath31 .",
    "this can be done just by replacing ( [ pure ] ) with the thermal one @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total hamiltonian .",
    "when @xmath10 is the total system , @xmath30 is clearly the same as the thermal entropy .",
    "there are several useful properties which the entanglement entropy satisfies generally .",
    "we consider the zero temperature case .",
    "we summarize some of them as follows :    * \\(i ) when @xmath8 is the complement of @xmath10 as before , we obtain s_a = s_b .",
    "[ ext ] this manifestly shows that the entanglement entropy is not an extensive quantity .",
    "this equality ( [ ext ] ) is violated at finite temperature .",
    "* \\(ii ) when @xmath10 is divided into two submanifolds @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we find + s_a_1+s_a_2s_a .",
    "[ extt ] this is called subadditivity . *",
    "\\(iii ) for any three subsystems @xmath10 , @xmath8 and @xmath36 that do not intersect each other , the following strong subadditivity inequality holds : @xmath37",
    "equivalently , we can have a more strong version of ( [ extt ] ) as follows @xmath38 for any subsystems @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath10 and @xmath8 do not intersect with each other , this relation is reduced to the subadditivity ( [ extt ] . )    more details of properties of the entanglement entropy can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "consider a qft on a @xmath9 dimensional manifold @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the time direction and the @xmath7 dimensional space - like manifold , respectively .",
    "we define the subsystem by a @xmath7 dimensional submanifold @xmath42 at fixed time @xmath29 .",
    "we call its complement the submanifold @xmath8",
    ". the boundary of @xmath10 , which is denoted by @xmath18 , divides the manifold @xmath41 into two submanifolds @xmath10 and @xmath8",
    ". then we can define the entanglement entropy @xmath6 by the previous formula ( [ eq : def entanglement entropy ] ) .",
    "sometimes this kind of entropy is called geometric entropy as it depends on the geometry of the submanifold @xmath10 .",
    "since the entanglement entropy is always divergent in a continuum theory we introduce an ultraviolet cut off @xmath43 ( or a lattice spacing ) . then the coefficient in front of the divergence turns out to be proportional to the area of the boundary @xmath18 of the subsystem @xmath10 as first pointed out in @xcite , s_a=+ ,",
    "[ divarea]where @xmath44 is a constant which depends on the system .",
    "this behavior can be intuitively understood since the entanglement between @xmath10 and @xmath8 occurs at the boundary @xmath18 most strongly .",
    "this result ( [ divarea ] ) was originally found from numerical computations @xcite and checked in many later arguments ( see e.g. recent works @xcite ) .    the simple area law ( [ divarea ] )",
    ", however , does not always describe the scaling of the entanglement entropy in generic situations . as we will discuss in details in the later sections , the entanglement entropy of 1d quantum systems at criticality scales",
    "logarithmically with respect to the linear size @xmath45 of @xmath10 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the central charge of the cft that describes the critical point .",
    "it has been also recently pointed out that the area law is corrected by a logarithmic factor as @xmath48(subleading terms ) for fermionic systems in the presence of a finite fermi surface , where @xmath45 is the characteristic length scale of the @xmath15 dimensional manifold @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "since we mainly consider relativistic qfts ( without a finite fermi surface ) in this paper , the area law ( [ divarea ] ) applies to our examples for @xmath50 as we will see .",
    "before we proceed to further analysis of entanglement entropy , it might be interesting to notice that this area law ( [ divarea ] ) looks very similar to the bekenstein - hawking entropy ( bh entropy ) of black holes which is proportional to the area of the event horizon @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the newton constant .",
    "intuitively , we can regard @xmath6 as the entropy for an observer who is only accessible to the subsystem @xmath10 and can not receive any signals from @xmath8 . in this sense ,",
    "the subsystem @xmath8 is analogous to the inside of a black hole horizon for an observer sitting in @xmath10 , i.e. , outside of the horizon .",
    "indeed , this similarity was an original motivation of the entanglement entropy @xcite ( earlier related idea can also be found in @xcite ) .",
    "even though this analogy is not completely correct as it is , the one - loop quantum correction to the bh entropy in the presence of matter fields is known to be equal to the entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "this interesting relation is an important hint to find the holographic dual of the entanglement entropy discussed later .",
    "indeed , the connection between this relation and our proposal has been found recently in @xcite by employing the brane - world setup instead of @xmath53 backgrounds .",
    "here we review and slightly extend existing computations of entanglement entropy in @xmath55 d cfts .",
    "the central charge of a given cft is denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "such a computation was initiated in @xcite and a general prescription how to calculate the quantity was given in a recent work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which we will explain in an orbifold theoretic manner .",
    "we separately discuss this lowest dimensional cft since only in this case we can exactly compute the entropy for general systems at present .      in order to find the entanglement entropy",

    "especially we showed that important parts of entanglement entropy are proportional to central charges in any 4d cfts from the analysis of weyl anomaly . even though we did not find this property for the other parts of the entropy , which are invariant under the weyl scaling , the holographic analysis tells us that the total entanglement entropy in strongly coupled 4d cfts is proportional to the central charge @xmath43 .",

    "we expect that this is a generic feature which might be applicable for systems that does not necessarily have gravity ( ads ) description .",
    "thus , it is interesting to investigate these quantities in several strongly interacting systems at criticality . in a sense",
    ", these quantities are a generalization of the central charges in cfts in even spacetime dimensions , or the quantum dimension in topological field theories .",
    "( note also that there is no counter part of the central charges in odd spacetime dimensions . ) for example , at least in principle , we can numerically study these universal quantities in the entanglement entropy in gapless spin liquids , and compare them with those computed from several candidate effective field theories @xcite .",
    "also , even though these effective field theories are suspected to be a gauge theory , it might not be straightforward to identify the wilson loop operator in a generic microscopic spin model .",
    "in that situation , one can instead look at the entanglement entropy since our analysis for ads black holes suggests it can be at least as useful as the wilson loop",
    ".    finally , our computation of entanglement entropy may also be useful to uncover holographical duals of string theory backgrounds which are not well - understood , such as de - sitter spaces and gdel spaces .",
