    "most marine creatures swim by changes in body shape . during these changes",
    "the outer surface remains smooth because of the elastic properties of the skin and tissue of the body . in earlier papers we approximated the motion of marine creatures by considering linked rigid bodies moving in two dimensions in response to changes in the angles between them , but neglected the effects of skin and tissue ( kajtar and monaghan 2008 ) .",
    "the bodies we considered were three identical ellipses connected by virtual rods which allowed fluid to move between the bodies .",
    "our high reynolds number results were in good agreement with the two dimensional inviscid calculations of kanso et al . , ( 2005 ) and melli et al .",
    ", ( 2006 ) and for lower reynolds numbers they were in good agreement with the viscous calculations of eldredge ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "although this model of swimming creatures is very crude it gives a surprisingly accurate prediction of the motion of a leech ( kajtar and monaghan , 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless it is desirable to improve the model to bring it closer to the motion of actual marine creatures . in particular",
    "we wish to mimic the elastic properties of their bodies while eliminating the flow between them . a simple way to do this is to connect the bodies by an elastic skin .",
    "we do not claim that this is anything but a crude representation of actual tissue , but it represents important features of such tissue and opens the way to represent it more accurately .",
    "we note , in particular , that an elastic surface will deform under pressure forces from the liquid .",
    "we simulate the system using sph , with separate particles for the liquid , the boundary of the rigid bodies , and the skin , and we derive the inviscid equations from a lagrangian variational principle .",
    "the viscous equations then follow by adding a standard sph viscous term .",
    "we apply this algorithm to both straight line motion and to turning motion .",
    "the algorithm conserves linear momentum to within round - off error . the time stepping introduces relative errors in the conservation of angular momentum which are typically @xmath2",
    ". however , because we approximate the infinite fluid by a periodic domain , there is a larger change in the angular momentum because periodic boundaries do not conserve the angular momentum of a particle system .",
    "an alternative approach to the simulation of swimming fish is the method described by borazjani et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and borazjani and sotiropoulos ( 2008 , 2009 , 2010 ) who use an immersed boundary method ( peskin , 1977 , 2002 ) . in their method the fish body is triangulated and treated as an immersed boundary which moves in a specified way .",
    "this method is similar to our method except that we use particles for the entire system while they use particles only to specify the fish - body surface which is not allowed to deform under liquid pressure forces .",
    "furthermore , their algorithm is currently designed for straight line motion so that the effect of torques on the body are not included .",
    "the plan of this paper is to discuss the sph equations of motion and the modeling of the skin .",
    "we then compare the speed and power output of three identical linked ellipses with and without the skin both forward and for turning motions .",
    "finally we apply the method to a system of three different ellipses linked as before .",
    "it is trivial to apply the algorithm to the swimming of bodies through free surfaces , and to studies of swimming in stratified media .",
    "the continuum equations we solve are the navier - stokes equations with boundaries formed by parts of rigid bodies and sections of skin . apart from the introduction of the skin , the equations are the same as those we have simulated before ( kajtar and monaghan , 2008 ) . to simplify the paper we give the details of the sph equations and refer the reader to the continuum equations described by kajtar and monaghan ( 2008 ) .      in the following we use @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the labels of the liquid sph particles , @xmath5 for the label of boundary force particles on the rigid bodies , and @xmath6 as the label for the skin particles .",
    "we write the equation of motion for the liquid particle @xmath3 in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8    @xmath9    and @xmath10    @xmath11 is the pressure and viscous force per unit mass due to the other fluid particles .",
    "@xmath12 is the force per unit mass due to the rigid bodies .",
    "it consists of two parts .",
    "the first is a direct pressure interaction which is a result of deriving the equations of motion from a variational principle using the continuity equation as a constraint .",
    "the second is based on sirovich s formulation of the effects of boundaries ( sirovich , 1967 , 1968 ) which we have discussed elsewhere ( monaghan and kajtar , 2009 ) .",
    "our prescription for this is similar to the immersed boundary method .",
    "a typical boundary particle @xmath5 on the surface of the rigid body exerts a repulsive force @xmath13 on fluid particle @xmath3 along the line joining their centers . here and elsewhere",
    "correspondingly , fluid particle @xmath3 exerts an equal but opposite force @xmath15 the form of the function @xmath16 is chosen so that it mimics a delta function and provides a force on the fluid particle which is normal to the surface of the body to a very close approximation ( monaghan and kajtar 2009 ) .",
    "the force per unit mass due to the skin particles @xmath17 is identical except the summations are over skin particles .    in these equations @xmath18 is the mass of particle @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the pressure and density at the position @xmath21 of particle @xmath4 .",

    "the choice of @xmath32 is discussed in detail by monaghan ( 1992 , 2005 ) . in this paper",

    "the third term is the skin force which we discuss in  [ sec : skin ] .",
    "the acceleration of skin particle @xmath6 is due to a pressure interaction with the fluid , a repulsive force interaction with the fluid ( these are similar to those discussed for rigid body boundary particles ) , and a force per unit mass due to neighbouring skin and/or body particles , @xmath47 the third term is the interaction with the bodies to which the skin is anchored ( @xmath48 . the interaction between any pair of sph particles is along the line of centres , and the force on one particle is opposite to the force on the other . as a consequence , linear and angular momentum are conserved .",

    "skin particles can move in response to the forces acting on them , whereas body particles only move when the body to which they are attached moves .",

    "the continuum limit of our skin shows that the speed of a transverse wave propagating along the skin is @xmath66 the parameter @xmath67 is then given by @xmath68 we choose the skin parameters so that @xmath69 is comparable to the speed of sound @xmath70 of our slightly compressible fluid to ensure the cfl condition from both speeds is similar . the details are discussed in connection with time stepping .",
    "the form of body particle - skin interaction @xmath71 in ( 2.7 ) is determined by the fact that only one of the boundary particles on a given rigid body can connect with a specified section of skin .",
    "the first and last particles on each section connect with a boundary particle of a body .",
    "in general , for this two dimensional problem , a body has four such connecting boundary particles , while the first and last bodies have two connecting particles . for",
    "any given boundary particle of a rigid body it either connects to a skin section or it does nt . if it does connect it does so by an elastic force term .",
    "thus , for ( 2.7 ) @xmath72      the angle @xmath73 which fixes the rotation of body @xmath36 is defined as the positive rotation of a line fixed in the body from the @xmath74 axis of a cartesian coordinate system fixed in space . for simplicity",
    "we assume the line fixed in the body is an axis of symmetry .",
    "the constraint conditions on the angles are @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the link number and @xmath77 is a specified function .",
    "the form of the @xmath77 determines the gait of the bodies . for the examples we consider here there are three bodies and two links as shown in figure [ fig : bodyangles ] with the skin removed for clarity . in the simplest case @xmath77",
    "is a function of @xmath78 but , in general , it depends on other variables .",
    "for example , in a biological problem , it could depend on the centre of mass coordinates in such a way that the fish slows down when it enters a region where food is abundant .",
    "in addition to the constraints on the angles there are constraints associated with the links .",
    "we assume the link , or pivot , is at a distance @xmath79 from the centre of mass of body @xmath36 .",
    "the condition on the @xmath80 components of the centres of mass of bodies @xmath36 and @xmath81 is that the @xmath80 coordinate of the link between them is given by @xmath82 similarly , the @xmath83 constraint is @xmath84 these constraints enable the coordinates of the centers of mass of the bodies , and their angles @xmath85 to be written in terms of those of any selected body .",
    "similarly , by differentiating the constraint conditions with respect to time , the velocities @xmath86 and @xmath87 and angular velocity @xmath88 of the bodies can be written as functions of the same selected body .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ( coordinates and velocities ) of @xmath89 linked bodies in two dimensions is therefore 6 compared with the @xmath90 degrees of freedom of @xmath89 independent bodies in two dimensions . if the @xmath77 are functions of @xmath78 alone it is possible to reduce the equations of motion to those involving the coordinates and velocities of one of the bodies .",
    "this can also be done when the @xmath77 are functions of both coordinates and time but it is inconvenient to eliminate variables and , in our view , simpler to take account of the constraints by using lagrange multipliers .",
    "for that reason we use lagrange multipliers even though , in the applications to be described in this paper , the @xmath77 are functions of @xmath78 only .",
    "for the case of three bodies we have two links and therefore 6 constraints .",
    "we denote the lagrange multipliers for the @xmath80 , @xmath83 and @xmath85 constraints of link @xmath76 by @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively . using standard methods for holonomic constraints ( e.g. landau and lifshitz , 1976 )",
    "we find the following expressions for the constraint forces @xmath41 and torques @xmath94 for the various bodies . for bodies 1 , 2 and 3 respectively , @xmath95 these constraint forces do not affect the total linear momentum of the bodies because they sum to zero .",
    "the constraint torques on bodies 1 , 2 and 3 respectively are @xmath96    the lagrange multipliers can be calculated quickly using a newton - raphson method .",
    "for example , with three bodies , the computational time is @xmath97 of the total computational time .",
    "the details are given by kajtar and monaghan ( 2008 ) .",
    "extending the algorithm to 4 or more bodies is straightforward .",
    "the rate of change of density of the fluid particles is @xmath98 where the summation is over the labels of all the fluid , rigid boundary and skin particles . in some formulations of sph",
    "the summation is only over the fluid particles , but a better estimate of the velocity divergence , and therefore the rate of change of the density , is obtained by including the velocity of the boundary and skin particles . as mentioned earlier the inviscid fluid equations can be obtained from a variational principle using the continuity equation as a constraint . as a result the pressure terms in the acceleration equation of the fluid then involve all the particles .",
    "the density of the boundary force particles and the skin particles is kept fixed . in practice",
    "the changes in density are small , but they need to be correctly calculated to ensure that the pressure is estimated accurately",
    ".    the @xmath32 associated with any fluid particle can be obtained from @xmath99 though we calculate it in step with the density from @xmath100      the fluid is assumed to be slightly compressible with an equation of state given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the reference density of the fluid . to ensure the flow",
    "has a sufficiently low mach number to approximate a constant density fluid accurately , we determine the speed of sound by @xmath103 where @xmath52 is the maximum speed of the fluid relative to the bodies . in this paper",
    "we take @xmath104 where @xmath3 is the semi major axis of the ellipse and @xmath105 is the frequency of the oscillation associated with the gait .",
    "the pressures of the body force particles and the skin particles are set to zero .",
    "the viscosity is determined by @xmath24 for which we choose the form ( monaghan 1997 , 2005 ) @xmath106 in this expression @xmath107 is a constant , and the notation @xmath108 is used .",
    "@xmath109 denotes the average density @xmath110 .",
    "we take the signal velocity to be @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the speed of sound at particle @xmath3 ( monaghan 1997 , although here we take @xmath113 to be half used in that paper and @xmath114 is therefore a factor 2 larger ) .",
    "the kinematic viscosity can be estimated by taking the continuum limit which is equivalent to letting the number of particles go to infinity while keeping the resolution length @xmath32 constant . by a calculation similar to that in monaghan ( 2005 ) it is found for the wendland kernel that the kinematic viscosity is @xmath115 sph calculations for shear flow agree very closely with theoretical results using this kinematic viscosity ( monaghan 2006 ) . using these results we can write ( 2.27 ) in the following form",
    "@xmath116 if desired @xmath117 can be replaced by using the reynolds number .",
    "the position of any fluid or skin particle is found by integrating @xmath118    the motion of a boundary particle can be determined from the motion of centre of mass and the rotation about the centre of mass .",
    "thus for particle @xmath5 on body @xmath36 , @xmath119 where , in this two dimensional problem , the rotation is around the @xmath120 axis which is perpendicular to the plane of the motion .",
    "a biological creature swims through a fluid by changing its shape .",
    "the oscillatory motion of a fin , for example , acts to propel the creature in a forward motion .",
    "slight variations to the motion allow it to accelerate , decelerate , and to turn .",
    "fish such as eels have a gait which is similar to a wave travelling from head to tail with moderately large amplitude along the entire length . a fish such as a mackerel has a gait which is similar to travelling wave with small amplitude until roughly half way down the body when it increases sharply .",
    "for the present two - dimensionsal , three - body swimmer considered here , the motion depends upon the angles @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the particular specification of these angles is referred to as the ` gait ' .",
    "the two gaits considered here are similar to that of an eel .",
    "the forward gait of motion was specified with @xmath123 where for these calculations @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we choose @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "note that this specification is identical to that of kanso et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and eldredge ( 2007 ) , but the notation is different .",
    "the turning gait is the same except @xmath129 , @xmath127 and @xmath130 and we take @xmath131 and @xmath125 . with this gait",
    "the angles @xmath132 are never positive .",
    "this turning specification is the same as that of kanso et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "in this paper we use the fourth order wendland kernel for two dimensions ( wendland 1995 ) .",
    "with @xmath133 this kernel is given by @xmath134 when @xmath135 and zero otherwise .",
    "we take the initial @xmath136 .      in the present simulations the liquid sph particles",
    "were initially placed on a grid of squares of side @xmath137 which defines the liquid particle spacing .",
    "those at least @xmath137 outside the boundary formed by the ellipses and the skin were retained .",
    "the boundary particles had a spacing @xmath138 where @xmath139 was typically 2 .",
    "the mass of the fluid particles was @xmath140 , and the mass of the boundary particles was @xmath141 of this mass .",
    "the boundary force particles on the body were placed around each ellipse with a spacing as close as possible to @xmath142 .",
    "having chosen which body particles connect to the skin , the skin sections were placed on straight lines a indicated in figure 1 .",
    "the fluid particles are not initially in equilibrium with the boundary forces so we allow them , and the skin particles , to move under damping . the rule for damping",
    "is given in the following section .",
    "after the damping is finished , the motion starts with the initial conditions set so that the fluid and skin particles have zero velocity and the bodies have zero net angular momentum and linear momentum consistent with the time derivatives of the constraints .",
    "the details of this are given by kajtar and monaghan ( 2008 ) .",
    "the time stepping is based on the second order symplectic integrator often called the verlet integrator .",
    "the basic equations we integrate take the following form for a liquid particle . throughout this section , for any quantity @xmath143",
    ", @xmath144 denotes its value at the beginning of the time - step , @xmath145 at the mid - point , and @xmath146 at the end of the step .",
    "the other particles do not change their density .",
    "@xmath147    in the first stage of the integration , the mid - point values are calculated for @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the body positions and orientations @xmath151 , @xmath73 , and the relative boundary particle positions @xmath152 . with @xmath153 denoting the time step @xmath154 with the mid - point coordinates known , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 can be calculated .",

    "@xmath175 is set to 1 for @xmath176 .",
    "the damping steps may seem large , but for these calculations which involve @xmath177 steps it is not significant .",
    "however , it would be desirable to have more efficient damping .",
    "the time step size , @xmath153 , is updated at the end of each time - step by @xmath178 where the minimum is over all fluid , boundary and skin particles evaluated at the mid - point of the time step .",
    "the first and last terms are cfl conditions for wave propagation in the fluid and in the skin respectively .",
    "the second term , @xmath179 , ensures that @xmath153 is sufficiently small to follow the motion of particles very close to a boundary .",
    "in the absence of skin our algorithm has been tested ( kajtar and monaghan 2008 , 2010 ) by detailed comparison against the results of experiments and those obtained by other authors .",
    "these include the motion of a tethered cylinder in a channel , the forced oscillation of a cylinder , and the inviscid calculations of kanso et al . , ( 2005 ) and melli et al . , ( 2006 ) where our sph results showed convergence to the inviscid results at reynolds numbers of @xmath180 .",
    "they were also in good agreement with the viscous calculations of eldredge ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) .    in this paper",
    "we begin with a test of our model of elastic skin by following the approach to equilibrium of fluid in a tank with an elastic skin bottom .",
    "we confirm the convergence of the calculations with finer resolution and show the the final displacement agrees with approximate theory .",
    "we then describe the simulated motion of linked ellipses with and without skin .",
    "the tank had depth @xmath181 and width @xmath182 , while the fluid density was @xmath183 ( because the system is two dimensional a unit thickness in the third dimension is assumed ) giving a total fluid mass of 1000 @xmath184 .",

    "we take the speed of sound to be @xmath190 .",
    "the fluid particles were placed on a grid of squares . in order to determine the convergence",
    "the calculations were run for a number of different initial particle spacings in the range @xmath191 to 1/60 .",
    "the ratio of the fluid particle spacing to the boundary ( and skin ) particle spacing was 2 .",
    "the skin was initially horizontal and when released the skin and fluid began damped oscillations which were followed until the skin was in equilibrium .",
    "the variation of the period of oscillation with the square of the initial particle spacing is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the convergence is second order .",
    "the final position of the centre of the skin can be estimated by linearizing the equations of equilibrium of an elastic skin . solving these equations",
    "we find that the displacement of the skin @xmath192 is given by @xmath193 at the highest resolution the sph result for the skin displacement at @xmath194 is -0.068 , which differs from the value -0.066 from ( 3.1 ) by 3 percent , which is satisfactory bearing in mind that ( 3.1 ) is only approximate .    .",

    "we relate these improvements to the skin preventing fluid passing between the bodies .",
    "although the swimmer with unequal body masses travels approximately half the distance in the same period of time , the power expended is reduced by a factor of @xmath221 . in this study , the gait , @xmath222 , and @xmath105 were identical . kajtar and monaghan ( 2010 ) showed that the efficiency of the swimming depends upon these parameters .",
    "undoubtedly the efficiency of the swimmer with unequal body masses would also improve for a different set of parameters .",

    "are conserved to high accuracy ; for the former the errors are due to round off and for the latter they are dominated by the effect of the periodic boundary conditions which do not conserve angular momentum for a particle system .",
    "the algorithm allows us to treat both straight line and turning motions and bodies of arbitrary shape and relative size .",
    "we have applied the algorithm to three linked ellipses which may be of different size , and shown that the presence of the skin affects the speed , power output and turning capacity of the bodies .",
    "there is no difficulty in extending the code to deal with more bodies .    within the limits imposed by the algorithm being two dimensional",
    "our results suggest many interesting applications including the study of bodies swimming through a free surface , or in a stratified medium , and the analysis of the hunting gaits of predators and the escape gaits of their prey .",
    "in this appendix we write out the lagrangian for the equations of motion in the absence of viscous forces , and show how the variational principle with the continuity equation as a constraint gives the pressure forces .          where the first three terms have the form @xmath227 @xmath228 and @xmath229 the fourth term involves the interactions between the particles .",
    "the first step is to note that the terms @xmath230 can be written in terms of the gradient of a potential according to @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a potential energy which we will denote by @xmath233 .",
    "the interaction part of the lagrangian is then given by @xmath234 where in the last term the values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 are those for connected pairs .",
    "following the usual rules the inviscid equations of motion can be worked out . because the lagrangian is invariant to translations and rotations of the coordinate system the linear and angular momentum are conserved . a discrete version of kelvin s circulation theorem can also be deduced ( monaghan 2005 ) . in order to work out lagrange",
    "s equations for the rigid bodies it is necessary to relate the change in position of the centres of mass of the bodies and their angles @xmath85 to changes in the positions of the body particles . to do this we note from ( 2.32 ) that for body force particle @xmath5 on body @xmath36 @xmath235        in this section we consider a purely fluid dynamical problem with the lagrangian @xmath236 which is to be substituted in the least action principle and varied with the continuity equation @xmath237 acting as a constraint .",
    "the summation over @xmath238 denotes a summation over all the particles .",
    "the variational principle of least action results in the equation of motion of particle @xmath3 @xmath239 where @xmath240 denotes a lagrangian change .",
    "we can write @xmath241 and note from the continuity equation that @xmath242 from the previous equation we deduce that @xmath243 where @xmath244 is a kronecker delta which is 1 if @xmath245 and zero otherwise .",
    "substitution of ( 4.13 ) into ( 4.11 ) then gives @xmath246 the first term is summed over all the particles whereas the second term is summed only over the fluid particles .",
    "however , the pressure assigned to the boundary particles and the skin particles is zero so we can extend the second summation over all the particles . noting that @xmath247 we can finally write        i. borazjani , l. ge , f. sotiropoulos , curvilinear immersed boundary method for simulating fluid structure interaction with complex 3d rigid bodies , j. comput . phys .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the two dimensional motion of three linked rigid bodies moving through a fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the bodies change their orientation relative to each other in a way which mimics the swimming of fish . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous simulations the bodies are connected by an elastic skin . </S>",
    "<S> the skin responds to the movement of the bodies and the pressure of the fluid and alters the flow around the bodies . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it prevents fluid moving between them . </S>",
    "<S> the system of bodies and skin is similar in appearance to a swimming leech or tadpole depending on the relative size of the bodies . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the system using sph , with three types of particles : liquid particles , boundary force particles determining the surface of the rigid bodies , and skin particles defining the elastic skin . </S>",
    "<S> the latter interact with each other , and with the boundary force particles to which they are anchored , by linear spring forces . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary force particles and the skin particles interact with the fluid particles by pair forces which are similar to the forces used in the immersed boundary method . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm is based on a lagrangian , and the equations of motion conserve linear momentum exactly and angular momentum very accurately . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the motion of rigid bodies with and without skin keeping the total mass of the bodies plus skin fixed . </S>",
    "<S> when the ellipses are identical , and the forward gait is used , the bodies swim @xmath0 faster when they are connected by skin , and they require less energy . when the ellipses have different sizes , with the front ellipse largest , they travel @xmath1 faster and use less energy . in the case of the turning gait , the identical ellipses turn faster with skin and use less energy , but the different sized ellipses turn more slowly with skin . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm is simple and robust and can be applied to bodies of arbitrary shape and in domains which include free surfaces and stratified fluids . </S>"
