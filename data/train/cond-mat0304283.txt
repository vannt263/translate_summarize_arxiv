    "the electronic structure of one - dimensional ( 1d ) conductors provides a valuable testing ground for the study of the quantum - mechanical many - body problem . on the theoretical side there",
    "exist various models for 1d interacting electron systems , which predict highly unusual low - energy excitations due to dynamical decoupling of charge and spin degrees of freedom . as a consequence ,",
    "the _ low - energy _ paradigmatic fermi liquid picture fails for 1d metals and a new generic many - body quantum state emerges which is commonly referred to as tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll).@xcite experimentally , quasi-1d metals are indeed found to display marked deviations from conventional metallic behavior , such as the absence of fermi - dirac edges in the single - particle excitation spectra probed by angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "@xcite however , an unambiguous spectroscopic identification of spin - charge separation and the existence of _ low - energy _ tll behavior in 1d metals is still lacking so far .",
    "additional interest in 1d electron systems arises from the suggestion that their physics may also be relevant to the electronic structure of the cuprate - based high - temperature superconductors,@xcite related to the recent discovery of charge ordering in these materials into narrow metallic 1d stripes separated by insulating regions.@xcite against this background the search for _ positive _ spectroscopic signatures of unusual electronic correlation effects in 1d metals remains to be of topical importance .    in the search for promising realizations of a prototypical ( quasi-)1d conductor the organic charge transfer salts appear as interesting candidates . due to the formation of linear molecule stacks in the crystal structure and an electronic charge transfer from cationic to anionic complexes they display strongly anisotropic metallic conductivities.@xcite photoemission experiments on such materials often find unusual spectral behavior like the absence of a metallic fermi edge .",
    "@xcite however , the lack of information on surface quality , especially with regard to the rapid photon - induced decomposition of organic compounds in the vacuum ultraviolet,@xcite casts serious doubts to what extent these observations reflect intrinsic electronic properties or rather a strongly disturbed surface .",
    "this is further corroborated by the failure of arpes to detect spectral energy-_vs._-momentum dispersions in most charge transfer salts.@xcite a notable exception is ttf - tcnq ( tetrathiafulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane ) , being the first ( and so far only ) organic conductor for which dispersing 1d bands have been observed by arpes .",
    "@xcite this indicates a well - ordered periodic surface structure and thus lends much enhanced significance to the observation of a deep pseudogap around the fermi energy , which even increases up to room temperature .",
    "this spectral behavior has recently been interpreted as possible indication of a highly unusual normal state in this 1d conductor.@xcite    in this paper we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the electronic structure of ttf - tcnq , elaborating on our earlier arpes results published in ref .. the comparison between experiment and band theory reveals significant discrepancies , concerning both the width of the conduction bands as well as their qualitative dispersion .",
    "while the band width renormalization can be attributed to a molecular surface relaxation , the remaining discrepancies indicate a failure of the bare band picture . rather , we are able to demonstrate that the tcnq - derived part of the arpes finite - energy dispersions can be consistently mapped onto the electron removal spectrum of the 1d hubbard model at finite doping.@xcite the importance of electronic correlations is further corroborated by a peculiar temperature dependence of the photoemission spectra . based on these findings the spectral behavior of ttf - tcnq",
    "is interpreted as spectroscopic evidence for spin - charge separation on an energy scale as large as the conduction band width .",
    "the monoclinic crystal structure of ttf - tcnq is shown in fig .  [ structure ] .",
    "the lattice parameters at room temperature are @xmath0  , @xmath1  , and @xmath2  , the monoclinic angle is @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite the important structural features are parallel linear stacks of planar ttf and tcnq molecules , respectively , oriented along the crystallographic * b * direction .",
    "the @xmath4-type molecular orbitals , extending over the entire size of each molecule , overlap with those of the neighboring molecules stacked above and below .",
    "maximum covalent bonding is achieved by tilting the molecular planes slightly about the * a*-axis , by @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the ttf and tcnq stacks , respectively ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ structure ] ) .",
    "@xcite the sign of the tilt angle alternates between neighboring stacks , leading to the herringbone structure of fig .",
    "[ structure ] .    as covalent bonding occurs only along the stack direction , the corresponding electronic ttf and tcnq bands",
    "are expected to be strongly anisotropic .",
    "charge transfer of @xmath7 electrons per molecule from ttf to tcnq drives both types of chains metallic .",
    "@xcite the conductivity along * b * is two to three orders of magnitude larger than perpendicular to it , making ttf - tcnq a truly quasi-1d metal .",
    "below @xmath8 k a charge density wave ( cdw ) develops along the * b*-direction , with wave - vector * q*@xmath9 * b * * ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) . the occurence of the cdw is accompanied by a metal - insulator transition . from the activated behavior of the conductivity a peierls gap of @xmath12 mev has been inferred .",
    "@xcite within mean - field weak coupling theory this translates into a transition temperature of @xmath13 k. due to the dominant effect of fluctuations in 1d systems the actual peierls transition is suppressed to about half of this value .",
    "an additional transverse ordering transition occurs at 38 k. @xcite the observation of diffuse x - ray scattering at @xmath14 up to 220 k indicates the importance of electronic correlations.@xcite",
    "the theoretical band structure was studied within the standard density functional theory ( dft ) approach using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite we used the self - consistent full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method as implemented in the wien97 code .",
    "@xcite a basis set of about 12500 lapws and additional `` local orbitals '' for the 2s ( 3s ) states of c and n ( s ) were employed .",
    "this corresponds to a lower basis set convergence than desirable , but was limited by the available computational resources .",
    "self - consistency was achieved using 18 * k*-points in the irreducible wedge of the bz and a temperature broadening scheme with 5 mry .",
    "the results are largely consistent with previous band calculations , @xcite but contain more detailed and reliable information due to the more advanced method .",
    "very good agreement is found with the recent lda / gga pseudopotential calculation of ref .. our calculations have been performed for the experimental room temperature structure.@xcite in addition , we also studied the effect of structural distortions as model for a possible surface relaxation ( see section [ pes and dft ] ) .    according to the dft calculation ttf - tcnq",
    "is characterized by strong intramolecular covalent bonding , whereas the interaction between the molecules is predominantly ionic .",
    "thus , the molecular orbitals are strongly localized except along the stacking direction , where small but notable covalent intermolecular bonding occurs . as seen in fig .",
    "[ bandstructure ] , this leads to the formation of two sets of quasi-1d conduction band doublets with pronounced dispersion along * b * * , _ i.e. _ the @xmath15z line of the brillouin zone ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ structure ] ) .",
    "the first one , just below @xmath16 at the @xmath15-point and unoccupied at z , is derived from @xmath4-bonded 2p orbitals of mostly c(6 ) atoms ( in the notation of ref .  ) and can thus be attributed to the tcnq stacks .",
    "the 130 mev splitting at @xmath15 results from a weak interaction between the two tcnq stacks in the unit cell .",
    "the other conduction band doublet , showing the opposite dispersion and remaining nearly degenerate , is mainly derived from the @xmath17 orbitals of s(1 ) and s(2 ) atoms and therefore associated with the ttf stacks .",
    "a small hybridization gap opens between the respective upper tcnq and ttf bands at the fermi level .",
    "the definite assignment of each band to either the tcnq or the ttf stacks can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ band origin ] , which for each band state shows the electronic charge localized on the tcnq and the ttf molecules , respectively .",
    "the metallic nature of the ttf - tcnq band structure arises from the energetic overlap of the quasi-1d tcnq and ttf bands and the electronic charge transfer between them .",
    "due to interstack interaction our calculation yields two fermi vectors , @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath11 , slightly larger than expected from the nesting vector @xmath20 @xmath11 derived from the cdw periodicity .",
    "the theoretical bandwidths along @xmath15z are 0.7 ev ( tcnq ) and 0.65 ev ( ttf ) , in fair agreement with experimental estimates of @xmath210.5 ev .",
    "@xcite    the conduction band dispersion perpendicular to * b * * is essentially negligible . along the @xmath15y line ( * a * * ) it is practically zero .",
    "slight dispersion of the tcnq - derived band occurs along @xmath15b , which results from weak interaction along * c * between the molecular end groups in neighboring tcnq stacks .",
    "however , the effect is too small to cause a band crossing along @xmath15b .",
    "the resulting fermi surface topology is therefore truly 1d .",
    "arpes measurements have been performed at our home lab , using he i radiation from a discharge lamp and an omicron ea 125 hr electron energy analyzer , and with synchrotron radiation at bessy ( berlin ) using an omicron ar 65 spectrometer.@xcite in both cases the energy and angular resolution amounted to 60 mev and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "all data were taken above the peierls transition at a sample temperature of 60 k. ttf - tcnq single crystals were grown by diffusion in pure acetonitrile and had typical dimensions of @xmath23 mm@xmath24 , with the long axis along * b*. their quality was characterized by x - ray diffraction , electron spin resonance , and conductivity measurements .",
    "clean surfaces parallel to the * ab*-plane were obtained by _ in situ _ cleavage of the crystals at a base pressure of @xmath25 mbar .",
    "the stoichiometry of this surface , which contains both tcnq and ttf chains , @xcite was verified by x - ray photoemission .",
    "@xcite from the observation of momentum - dispersive arpes structures we conclude on a crystalline long - range order of the surface , which has independently been confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm).@xcite    great care was taken to avoid photon - induced surface damage by minimizing the exposure to the incident 25 ev radiation .",
    "the effect is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ photon effects ] , which contains spectra taken at the experimental fermi vector . for a freshly prepared surface , _ i.e. _",
    "immediately after cleavage of the crystal , an intense peak is observed close to the fermi level .",
    "after two hours of exposure to vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) radiation its intensity has strongly decreased and its peak position shifted by more than 0.1 ev away from @xmath16 .",
    "however , the original spectrum can be completely recovered by taking data on another previously unexposed sample spot .",
    "this demonstrates that the observed surface degradation is not simply due to contamination or decomposition in the vacuum but indeed caused by vuv radiation .",
    "unfiltered higher order light or direct use of higher photon energies ( @xmath2635 ev ) reduces the time scale of the vuv - induced surface damage even down to minutes .",
    "@xcite all data presented in the remainder of this paper were obtained before noticeable surface decomposition occured .",
    "figure [ edcs ] shows energy distribution curves obtained along the @xmath27 axis , _ i.e. _ the 1d direction .",
    "the spectral features display pronounced dispersion , whereas spectra measured perpendicular to @xmath27 are dispersionless ( not shown here , see refs . ) .",
    "our data are in excellent agreement with those of zwick _",
    "et al._@xcite but display in parts more spectral detail .",
    "for example , in normal emission ( @xmath28 ) we can clearly distinguish two peaks at 0.19 and 0.54 ev below @xmath16 , labeled a and b in fig .",
    "[ edcs ] . in ref .",
    "peak a appeared only as a shoulder and was not discussed . for off - normal emission peak b",
    "splits into two parts .",
    "the upper one ( retaining the label b ) moves upwards in energy and converges with a close to @xmath29 , where both features reach their closest approach to the fermi level .",
    "we identify this position as fermi vector which yields @xmath30 @xmath11 , in good agreement with the value derived from the cdw vector .",
    "note however , that despite the high conductivity no metallic fermi edge is observed in the @xmath31-spectra ( see also fig .",
    "[ photon effects ] ) , as already observed in ref .  .",
    "the spectral intensity rather decreases almost linearly down to zero at exactly the fermi level .",
    "beyond @xmath31 a weak structure c moves back again from the fermi level and displays a dispersion symmetric about @xmath32 corresponding to the z - point of the brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite returning to the splitting of peak b away from @xmath33 we note that its lower part ( labeled d ) disperses downwards in energy and eventually becomes obscured by peak c. for very high emission angles , corresponding to a @xmath34-vector in the next zone , one observes a symmetry - related weak shoulder d@xmath35 .",
    "upon cooling through the peierls temperature the fermi vector spectrum has been shown to display the expected opening of a cdw gap.@xcite however , even more remarkable is the temperature dependence of the @xmath31-spectrum _ above _ the transition.@xcite this is shown in fig .",
    "[ t - spectra](a ) where considerable spectral changes are observed between 60 and 260 k. the interpretation of these changes hinges on a careful intensity normalization of the spectra .",
    "this has been achieved by normalizing them on the residual background intensity above the fermi energy , which is a good measure of the exciting photon flux.@xcite incidentally , this procedure leads to an almost complete alignment of the temperature spectra at high binding energies ( @xmath36 ev ) . at lower energies the spectral changes from low to high temperatures",
    "can then be described as a pronounced intensity loss of the peak near the fermi level ( and its slight shift away from @xmath16 ) , while at the same time the intensity increases between -0.4 and -1.3 ev ( see difference spectra in fig .",
    "[ t - spectra](b ) ) . with the described normalization",
    "the _ integrated _ spectral weight remains however conserved within experimental uncertainty .",
    "we also note that these temperature effects are fully reversible .",
    "these observations and , in particular , the conservation of the total intensity suggest that at @xmath37 spectral weight is transferred from low to high binding energies with increasing temperature .",
    "however , based on the temperature dependence of the @xmath31-spectrum alone we can not rule out the possibility that the effect is caused by a redistribution of spectral weight in _ momentum space _ rather than in energy , caused , e.g. , by phonon - induced disorder which may be large in organic compounds . in order to check this we have determined the @xmath38-integrated density of states ( dos ) by summing up arpes spectra covering the entire 1d brillouin zone from @xmath15 to z. fig .",
    "[ t - spectra](c ) shows the result for @xmath39 and 300 k. a smearing of the spectral weight distribution in momentum space due to thermally excited phonons should have no effect on the @xmath38-integrated energy spectrum , except possibly for the phonon - induced lifetime broadening of the spectral peaks .",
    "the latter seems to be the case for the temperature change around @xmath40 ev ( the corresponding arpes spectra show that the broadening occurs only near the zone edge , indicating a particularly strong electron - phonon coupling there ) . at low binding energies",
    "we recover the temperature dependence of the @xmath31 spectrum ( cf .",
    "the difference spectra in fig .",
    "[ t - spectra](b ) and [ t - spectra](d ) ) , which can clearly not be explained by line broadening .",
    "we hence conclude that the temperature behavior at the fermi vector is indeed caused by a spectral weight transfer in energy .",
    "the identification of the arpes dispersions indicated by the thin lines in fig .  [ edcs ]",
    "is further substantiated by a different representation of the data .",
    "figure  [ intensity map ] shows the negative second energy derivative of the photocurrent @xmath41 , clipped at zero value , as grayscale plot in the @xmath42-plane .",
    "this enhances the visibility of the spectral structures and visualizes their dispersion in a completely unbiased way .",
    "also shown are the dft conduction bands .",
    "the comparison of experiment and theory reveals qualitative similarities but also significant discrepancies . starting our discussion with experimental structure c we find its dispersive behavior in agreement with that of the theoretical ttf - derived bands , except that the ( occupied ) bandwidth exceeds the theoretical one by a factor of @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , structures a and b can be attributed to the theoretical tcnq doublet bands if one accounts for largely enhanced ( a : @xmath44 and b : @xmath45 ) band widths .",
    "finally , we point out that experimental feature d finds _ no _ counterpart in the band calculation .    our experimental conduction band widths are not only at variance with band theory but",
    "also clearly exceed the estimates derived from bulk - sensitive measurements .",
    "@xcite as the arpes probing depth is comparable to the thickness of a single molecular layer ( @xmath46  , cf .",
    "[ surface relaxation ] ) , the observed discrepancies suggest that the electronic structure of the topmost layer(s ) differs from that of the volume",
    ". one possible origin could be a structural surface relaxation involving the tilt angles of the planar ( and relatively rigid ) ttf and tcnq molecules , respectively , relative to the * b*-axis .",
    "we note that these angles correspond to a total energy minimum configuration resulting from a competition between maximum covalent bonding along the stack direction and minimum coulomb energy in the madelung potential of the surrounding molecular ions.@xcite it seems conceivable that at the surface this balance is offset due the altered madelung potential , leading to different equilibrium tilt angles of the topmost molecules , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ surface relaxation ] .",
    "if the surface tilt happens to be larger than that in the volume , it will result in a reduced separation between the molecular planes within a given stack .",
    "this in turn leads to an increase of the intermolecular hopping integral and hence the bandwidth .",
    "we have tested this idea by performing a band calculation for a hypothetical volume structure with increased tilt angles ( approximately doubled relative to their bulk values ) , which indeed leads to a strongly enhanced band width at least for the ttf - derived bands in good agreement with their arpes dispersion . however , a realistic calculation of the surface relaxation by total energy optimization for a semi - infinite crystal is currently beyond our technical limits owing to the large size of the ttf - tcnq unit cell .",
    "unfortunately , a reliable _ experimental _ determination of the molecular surface tilt seems also out of reach , as the usual methods for surface structure determination do not work here .",
    "low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) of ttf - tcnq is strongly hampered by electron - induced surface damage even faster than that caused by the vuv photons.@xcite stm as another important structural surface probe is only capable of determining the surface periodicity @xcite but can not give any reliable information on molecular off - plane orientation .",
    "therefore , the suggested surface relaxation has to remain a mere speculation at this point .",
    "whatever its microscopic origin , the observed enhancement of the arpes bandwidth with respect to the volume is an experimental fact and we thus have to accept it as an established property of the probed surface layer which distinguishes it from the bulk .",
    "we are finally left with feature d , which even under the assumption of a surface band width renormalization can not be identified with any of the theoretical volume bands .",
    "it might appear tempting to attribute it to an intrinsic surface state .",
    "however , such an interpretation is in conflict with the observed fermi vector of the other bands : since d stays well below the fermi level and would thus be occupied throughout the entire brillouin zone ( in a one - electron band picture ) , it should severely affect the delicate charge balance between the ttf and tcnq bands and shift the surface fermi vector notably from its bulk value , which is not the case .",
    "another explanation of d as backfolded image of the ttf band induced by long - ranged cdw fluctuations @xcite is ruled out due to the lack of other evidence for backfolding in the data . as we will discuss in the following section",
    ", spectral feature d finds a natural explanation as a many - body effect .",
    "there is substantial experimental evidence that coulomb interaction plays an essential role in the electronic structure of ttf - tcnq @xcite and that a purely band theoretical description may be inadequate . on the theoretical side , the dramatic effects of electron - electron interaction on the _ low - energy _ properties of 1d metals",
    "have been studied in much detail using the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model .",
    "@xcite it is based on a 1d conduction band with infinite linear dispersion and treats interaction by including scattering processes about the fermi points.@xcite the tl model focusses on the low - energy physics and describes in detail the breakdown of the quasiparticle picture for the low - lying excitations and the emergence of tll behavior resulting from the dynamical decoupling of spin and charge .",
    "for example , the tl model predicts a low - energy onset of the single - particle spectrum which is no longer given by a metallic fermi edge but rather by a power law behavior @xmath47 , with the exponent @xmath48 determined by the coupling parameters of the model .",
    "the low - energy physics of the tl model defines in fact a universality class which includes also more complicated 1d models of interacting electrons.@xcite however , by its very construction the tl model contains no intrinsic energy scale , and therefore the energy range of its applicability to real 1d metals is principally unknown , making it less useful for the study of _ finite - energy _",
    "spectral properties .",
    "as seen in the previous section , the arpes data of ttf - tcnq indeed show unusual behavior on an energy scale of the _ entire band width _",
    ", not just near the fermi level . the spectral properties over this much wider energy range",
    "have so far only been addressed by the 1d single - band hubbard model .",
    "compared to band theory it appears as a much better starting point for the description of ttf - tcnq and other organic charge transfer salts .",
    "in fact , various properties of these 1d conductors have already successfully been analysed within a hubbard model framework , such as the magnetic susceptibility @xcite or the nuclear spin relaxation rate.@xcite the underlying idea is that the local interaction energy @xmath49 for two electrons residing on the same molecule dominates over long range coulomb contributions .",
    "the delocalization of the charge carriers is described by the hopping integral @xmath50 ( the bare bandwidth amounts to @xmath51 in one dimension ) .",
    "the hubbard model also defines an intrinsic energy scale for spin excitations , which for large values of @xmath52 is given by the exchange constant @xmath53 $ ] , @xcite with @xmath54 being the band filling parameter ( @xmath55 for ttf - tcnq ) .    at low excitation energies the physics of the 1d hubbard model with finite doping follows the tll phenomenology .",
    "the @xmath52-dependence of the non - classic tll exponents , which control the asymptotics of the low - energy correlation functions , can be extracted from its bethe - ansatz solution.@xcite however , in contrast to the tl model the hubbard model also allows the study of finite - energy properties .",
    "recently , an exact analysis on the basis of the bethe - ansatz has shown @xcite that all energy eigenstates of the 1d hubbard model can be described in terms of occupancy configurations of various collective spin - only and charge - only modes , namely _ spinons _ ( zero - charge spin excitations ) , _ holons _ ( spinless charge excitations ) , and a third type of charged quantum objects .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .   and for details .",
    "the important point is that this description is valid for _ all _ energy scales of the model and follows from the non - perturbative organization of the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "here we are interested in the electron removal spectrum of the 1d hubbard model .",
    "qualitative properties of the spectrum have already been derived from early calculations within the strong coupling limit ( @xmath56).@xcite more recently , it has become possible to determine the spectral behavior also for intermediate interaction strengths ( @xmath57 ) , either by numerical methods@xcite or by bethe - ansatz.@xcite here we will restrict ourselves to the energy-_vs._-momentum dependence of the spectral features , which can be calculated exactly with the latter method . the calculation of matrix elements between ground and excited states and hence of the spectral weight distribution is more complicated with this method and will be presented elsewhere.@xcite a schematic picture of the spectral dispersions is given in fig .",
    "[ hubbard model spectra](a ) . as the hole generated by the removal of one electron decomposes ( or  fractionalizes  ) into decoupled spin and charge excitations , there is a manifold of ways to distribute excitation energy and momentum among these collective modes giving rise to an excitation continuum , indicated by the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ hubbard model spectra](a )",
    ".    however , due to the phase space available for electronic hole fractionalization this continuum is not structureless .",
    "it is dominated by lines of singularities ( solid curves in fig .",

    "both branches are degenerate , but due to their different group velocities they split away from the fermi level .",

    "we observe no extraordinary behavior other than the enhanced bandwidth relative to band theory .",
    "complimentary to the tcnq band , the ttf - derived conduction band ( or rather band doublet ) is more than half - filled ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "it is possible that the model parameters suitable for the ttf band differ from those for the tcnq band and are such that spin - charge separation is less pronounced .",
    "moreover , x - ray diffraction studies have reported the existence of @xmath65 cdw fluctuations on the ttf chains up to 220 k.@xcite it is not clear how such fluctuations may affect the arpes spectra ; they could for example account for the relatively large line - width of the experimental ttf peak ( cf .",

    "the interpretation of the ttf part of the arpes data has to remain an open question .",

    "we should rather use the value inferred from the dft bandwidth , @xmath76 ev . as the intramolecular coulomb energy @xmath49 is a local quantity , we do not expect large differences between bulk and surface . with @xmath77",
    "ev we thus obtain for the coupling strength in the volume a value of @xmath78 . from @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "we can also calculate the magnetic exchange energy @xmath79 , which for the volume yields 21 mev ( 110 mev for the surface ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with experimental estimates of @xmath79 inferred from magnetic susceptibility measurements which range between @xmath80 and @xmath81 mev.@xcite .    further evidence for the importance of correlation effects is provided by the unusual temperature dependence of the photoemission spectra .",
    "commonly , temperature effects are caused by electron - phonon interaction with spectral changes occuring on an energy scale @xmath82 , due to an altered population of phonons with a comparable energy ( at least within harmonic approximation and with linear coupling).@xcite however , for ttf - tcnq we observe upon warming - up a shift of spectral weight from low to high binding energies by @xmath83 ev , _",
    "i.e. _ an energy of the order of the bare bandwidth and hence much larger than the thermal energy scale",
    ". this seems to rule out conventional electron - phonon coupling as the origin of the temperature dependence , though we can not completely exclude the possibility of non - linear coupling effects.@xcite    a much more natural explanation of the observed temperature effects can be inferred from calculations for the quarter - filled 1d @xmath84 model in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath85 , corresponding to the @xmath68 case of the hubbard model).@xcite here it was found that , compared to the zero temperature spectrum , considerable spectral weight is redistributed from the  spin  peak at the fermi level to the bottom of the  charge  band at @xmath86 already at temperatures @xmath87 , exactly as observed in our data .",
    "we are not aware of similar calculations for moderate interaction strengths , but we expect this result to hold qualitatively also for finite @xmath88 or @xmath52 , respectively .    in conclusion , both the dispersive behavior of the tcnq - derived arpes structures as well as the temperature dependence of the spectra are found to be well accounted for , in parts even quantitatively , by the finite - energy spectral properties of the 1d hubbard model . the observed discrepancies to band theory thus appear as a consequence of spin - charge separation , which occurs in that model on all energy scales.@xcite in this interpretation our arpes results on ttf - tcnq represent the first spectroscopic observation of spin - charge separation in a quasi-1d metal on an energy scale of the conduction band width .",
    "it is interesting to note that there exists independent experimental support for the occurence of spin - charge decoupling in ttf - tcnq from the contrasting temperature dependence of conductivity and spin susceptibility .",
    "@xcite    we close this section with a discussion of the spectral onset near @xmath16 , for which the 1d hubbard model predicts a low energy behavior @xmath89 with the exponent ranging between @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath56 , respectively.@xcite this is in clear contrast to our experimental observation of an almost _ linear _ energy dependence , for which there are various possible explanations .",
    "first of all , the physics of the 1d hubbard model is expected to be applicable only for excitation energies larger than the transverse transfer integrals associated with interchain hopping ( the dft band dispersions of fig .",
    "[ bandstructure ] give an estimate of the relevant energy scale ) .",
    "in addition , long - range interactions beyond a simple hubbard model ( e.g.  the effect of nearest neighbor interaction , which may be non - negligible for ttf - tcnq @xcite ) are capable to increase the onset exponent up to @xmath93 .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , the spectral properties of extended hubbard models at higher binding energies are not well known .",
    "finally , it has recently been argued that low - energy power law exponents of the order of unity can also be caused by impurities and/or defects on the surface of an organic conductor , which localize the 1d electrons to strands of finite length , leading to the concept of a `` bounded luttinger liquid''.@xcite    however , it seems likely that the failure of the simple hubbard model at _ low _ energies is not just a purely electronic effect .",
    "rather , one should also expect pronounced contributions by electron - phonon coupling , which after all is strong enough to drive a peierls transition at low temperatures . on the other hand , a simple interpretation of our linear spectral onset in terms of a peierls pseudogap due to cdw fluctuations above @xmath8 k",
    "must be ruled out , as the size of the underlying low - temperature peierls half - gap is only 20 mev,@xcite much smaller than the energy range of the onset ( @xmath94 mev ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath95 cdw fluctuations disappear already at 150 k , while @xmath96 fluctuations - though still observable at 300 k - strongly weaken with increasing temperature.@xcite in contrast , the arpes spectral weight near @xmath16 is found to become reduced ( while still being linearly energy - dependent ) from low to high temperatures ( cf .",
    "[ t - spectra ] ) .",
    "the large energy range of the spectral onset indicates the importance of coupling to other phonons than those involved in the peierls transition and is consistent with the phonon spectrum of ttf - tcnq , which indeed reaches up to @xmath97 mev.@xcite even so , any detailed understanding of the spectral properties of ttf - tcnq at low energies will require the consideration of electronic correlations _ and _ electron - phonon coupling effects on an equal footing , which remains to be a challenge to modern solid state theory",
    ". whatever the details of any such description , our above results indicate that its high - energy physics must be close to that of the 1d hubbard model .",
    "the electronic structure of ttf - tcnq above the peierls transition as probed by arpes deviates significantly from dft band calculations .",
    "the experimental observation of an approximate doubling of the overall conduction band width relative to band theory is attributed to a structural relaxation of the topmost molecular layers . when accounted for an enhanced electron hopping integral at the surface",
    ", the spectra of the tcnq - derived bands can be brought into consistent and even quantitative agreement with the theoretical finite - energy single - particle spectrum of the 1d hubbard model .",
    "this picture is further supported by a temperature - dependent redistribution of spectral weight over energies much larger than the thermal energy . within this interpretation",
    "our experimental results provide spectroscopic evidence for spin - charge separation on an energy scale of the conduction band width .",
    "in contrast , the spectral behavior at low binding energies is found to deviate from that of the simple 1d hubbard model , possibly due to higher dimensional effects combined with the additional importance of electron - phonon coupling and possibly also long - range electron - electron interaction .",
    "ttf - tcnq thus represents an interesting model system to study electronic correlation effects in a 1d metal .",
