    "there has been a rapid growth of research interest on the rashba soi in low - dimensional condensed matter system after the proposal of spin field effect transistor by datta and das @xcite .",
    "this is due to the possible applications in spintronics devices @xcite .",
    "the soi is responsible for other interesting effects like spin hall effect @xcite , spin dynamics and zitterbewegung @xcite . in the narrow gap semiconductor heterostructures",
    ", the dominant rashba soi @xcite appears due to the asymmetric quantum wells .",
    "the rashba soi strength is proportional to the internally generated crystal field .",
    "this strength can also be enhanced by applying suitable electric field perpendicular to the plane of the electron s motion @xcite .",
    "a pseudo zeeman effect occurs at finite momentum of the electron due to the rashba soi even in absence of magnetic field . a direct manifestation of pseudo zeeman effect due to the soi is a regular beating pattern in the magnetoelectric transport measurements such as shubnikov - de hass ( sdh ) oscillations @xcite in 2deg .",
    "these oscillations occur due to two closely spaced different frequency of spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "the rashba soi strength is determined by analyzing the beating patterns in the sdh oscillations @xcite .",
    "the soi was determined by fitting the experimental data with the model calculations for the sdh oscillations .",
    "later , many realistic approach was considered and the estimated strength is in good agreement with the extrapolated results @xcite .",
    "recently , there is an interesting proposal @xcite of determining the rashba soi strength by analyzing the beating patterns in the weiss oscillations @xcite .    on the other hand , thermoelectric properties of materials",
    "@xcite have attracted considerable interest from both experimental and theoretical point of view due to potential applications in technology @xcite .",
    "there is a strong effect of perpendicular magnetic field on thermal transport properties of any system .",
    "therefore , the magnetothermal coefficients can be used as an additional probe . in presence of perpendicular magnetic field ,",
    "the diffusing charge carriers experience the lorentz force .",
    "this produces a transverse electric field in addition to the longitudinal electric field .",
    "the longitudinal thermopower or the seebeck coefficient is defined as @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse thermopower or the nernst coefficient is defined as @xmath1 . here ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the induced voltage generated by the thermal gradient and the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies on thermoelectric coefficients of 2deg systems in presence of magnetic field started after the discovery of the quantum hall effect .",
    "in most of the thermoelectric measurements of 2deg systems , the thermopower is being measured since the thermal resistivity of a 2deg is extremely high .",
    "the nernst coefficient is quite sensitive to various properties of the systems e.g. shape of the fermi surface as well as electron mean free path @xcite .",
    "it is being used as a probe to study various strongly correlated electron systems such as kondo lattices @xcite and graphene field effect transistors @xcite .",
    "moreover , the thermopower @xmath4 and the thermal conductivity @xmath5 are used as the metrics to measure the thermoelectric performance @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , we will show here that magntethermoelectric coefficients can also be used to determine the rashba soi strength .",
    "there are mainly two mechanisms contribute to the thermal conductivity and the thermopower , namely the thermodiffusion and phonon drag .",
    "generally , the phonon drag contribution is vanishingly small at very low temperature . in absence of the magnetic field ,",
    "the diffusive thermopower has been continuously reported in the low range of temperature @xcite . in presence of magnetic field ,",
    "the oscillation of the diffusive thermopower has been studied theoretically as well as experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is seen in the low magnetic field regime that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are periodic in inverse of the magnetic field .",
    "this is due to the oscillating density of states of the 2deg in presence of magnetic field .",
    "there is no theoretical or experimental study on magnetothermoelectric properties of the 2deg systems with the rashba soi .",
    "we report here for the first time the effect of the rashba soi on thermal transport properties of a 2deg in presence of perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the total thermalconductivity and the total thermopower produce beating patterns because the thermoelectric coefficients for spin - up and spin - down electrons oscillate with two closely spaced different frequencies . by analyzing the beating pattern ,",
    "we find a simple equation which determines the rashba soi strength if the magnetic fields corresponding to any two successive beat nodes and the number of oscillations in between are known from the experiment .",
