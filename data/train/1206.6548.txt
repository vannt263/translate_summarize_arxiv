    "the formation of dark matter haloes in cosmology has been investigated in great details and impressive accuracy by numerical simulations .",
    "an important discovery was the existence of the universal nfw density profile ( navarro , frenk , & white , 1997 ) .",
    "later taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) discovered another intriguing property , the so - called pseudo - phase density , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the projected density and @xmath6 is the velocity dispersion , is a universal power law as a function of radius .",
    "the exponent of this power law corresponds exactly to the exponent obtained for the self - similar solutions developped by fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) in the special case of the secondary infall model studied by bertschinger ( 1985 ) .",
    "the initial purely radial bertschinger model was recently refined by zukin & bertschinger ( 2010a , 2010b ) by introducing tidal torque . in this new approach zukin &",
    "bertschinger confirmed the universality of the pseudo phase space density at large and intermediate scale but questioned the universality at small scale .",
    "very high resolution numerical simulations also raise questions about the universality of the pseudo phase space density at small scale ( stadel _ etal _ 2009 ) .",
    "an interesting addition to this debate is the work of nusser a. ( 2001 ) who show that the introduction of momenta does not modify the mass profile .",
    "recent investigations confirmed the universal power law behavior of the pseudo phase space density , and improved the numerical accuracy by taking into account the ellipticity of the haloes and the substructures .",
    "as an example ludlow _ etal _ ( 2010 ) demonstrated that the residual to the fit of a power law to the pseudo phase space density is typically about 10 to 20% and does not exceed 30% .",
    "the power law behavior of the pseudo phase space density is now observed with impressive accuracy over 3 decades in radius .",
    "note that the universality of power laws for the pseudo - phase density is stronger than the universality of the nfw profile ( see vogelsberger , mohayaee , & white 2011 ) . for",

    ", some attention will be given to a simpler problem , the one dimensional cold collapse .",
    "in particular it is interesting to consider and study another universal behavior , the convergence of the one dimensional cold collapse to a universal power law density with exponent @xmath1 for a large class of initial conditions ( binney 2004 ) .",

    ".the following change of variable @xmath32 is introduced with @xmath33 in eq [ self_eq0 ] .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath34 , as a consequence the exponents of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are positive .",
    "but note that this requirement is not sufficient since the divergence of the total mass must be avoided . for @xmath37 a finite mass would imply a cutoff of the power law density at the center , and",
    "would generate a force which would not be a power law anymore .",
    "this additional requirement implies that @xmath38 for this type of one dimensional solutions .",
    "the corresponding equation for the variable @xmath36 is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the function : @xmath41 and @xmath42 we introduce again new variables , @xmath43 , with : @xmath44 the new equation in these variables is : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 +   + an interesting case is when the potential @xmath48 is stationary , which corresponds to , @xmath49 and to @xmath50 ( see eqs [ self_eq ] and [ scaled_pot ] ) . in this case",

    "note that if @xmath64 behaves at origin like a power law with negative exponent this condition will be satisfied , and that as a consequence the behavior of the @xmath64 solution at origin will not be singular , which is a condition for the validity of the approximation at small @xmath53 . as a consequence",
    "the general solution and the approximation at small @xmath53 are consistent for @xmath50 .",
    "to study the geometry of the solution the iso - contours of the solution will be investigated . considering a contour with phase space density @xmath65 , and using eq [ sol_gen ] ,",
    "the equation of the corresponding contour is : @xmath66 with the following definitions : @xmath67 it is easy to realize that eq [ fold_eq ] corresponds to the equation of a spiral in phase space .",
    "since @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant , the equation reduces to @xmath70 , a specific example is a logarithmic spiral which would occur if @xmath71 is a power law plus a constant .",
    "an important parameter of this spiral structure is the inter - fold distance .",
    "this parameter is straightforward to measure in numerical simulations , and can be easily compared to the analytic expectation .",

    "it is important to note that the thickness of a given contour can be derived using the same method as the inter - folds distance .",
    "the variation of position for a contour in eq [ fold_eq ] corresponds to a variation of @xmath93 , where @xmath94 corresponds to a differential in the initial conditions for two opposite sides of the contour . as a consequence the calculations are identical to the calculations performed for the inter - fold distance , and",
    "the contour thickness is proportional to the inter - fold distance .",
    "it is useful to define the self similar coordinates in the 6d space , @xmath95 , and the corresponding modulus of distances @xmath96 and velocities @xmath27 .",

    "note that in three dimension @xmath97 is not required anymore , to avoid the divergence of the mass at center @xmath98 is sufficient .",
    "the solution is the sum of a general solution plus a special solution . to facilitate the calculations we introduce @xmath99 , and a power law potential @xmath100 , @xmath34 ,",

    "provided that the function @xmath110 behaves like a power law with positive exponent , the relevant @xmath112 term will become negligible at small @xmath53 and the solution in eq [ sol_multi ] is an asymptotic solution at small @xmath53 .",
    "the power - law behavior of the pseudo phase space density observed in 3d numerical simulations is a strong motivation to study the pseudo phase space density of the solutions . for a comparison to the numerical simulations",
    "the quantity of interest is the smooth pseudo phase space density ( see sec . 9 for a definition of the smooth quantities ) .",
    "it is simple to construct an analytic self similar solution at equilibrium by using a power law model .",
    "provided all histograms of the values of @xmath114 are power laws , the smoothed density of @xmath114 will also correspond to a power law . for an equilibrium model",
    "it is straightforward to derive the parameters of this power law model .",
    "however due to the geometric nature of the solution ( see sec .",
    "6 ) the cold solution occupies a finite range . the cold solution is a series of folds , with the first fold as the boundary of the system .",
    ". 6 shows that this outer boundary may be approximated with a constant radius in @xmath53 , @xmath115 . as a consequence",
    "the density of the cold solution and of its smoothed expectation must be cut outside some radius @xmath116 .",
    "the smooth pseudo phase density for the cold density is thus obtained by estimating the expectation for the smooth power law model with initial density @xmath117 within @xmath116 .",
    "the variable @xmath96 is the modulus of @xmath8 , at this point it is also useful to introduce the variable @xmath27 , the modulus of @xmath9 . in three dimension",
    "the pseudo phase density is @xmath4 , thus the following integrals have to be estimated numerically : @xmath118 @xmath119 with : @xmath120 @xmath121 and : @xmath122 note that in the above integrals the re - scaling of @xmath116 implies the re - scaling of @xmath96 and the re - scaling of the integrals , thus the general shape of @xmath4 may be obtained for any value of @xmath116 .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented in fig [ pseudo1 ] .",
    "are represented from top to bottom for @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 . ]",
    "the pseudo phase density of the solution is consistent with the theoretical power law expectation near the center and deviates near the edge of the system .",
    "this is obviously expected since the cut has more effect at the edge than at the center .",
    "an interesting consequence of the behavior of these solutions , is that even if the pseudo phase density deviates significantly from a power law near the edge of the system it is still an auto - similar solution in this area .",
    "although the solution computed here is isotropic which is not the case of the dark matter haloes investigated in numerical simulations , this result suggests that even if the pseudo phase space density is not a power law in some area , it is still possible that the phase space density is self - similar in this area .",
    "the evolution of a system of particles with small initial velocity dispersion in the two dimensional phase space under the action of one dimensional planar gravity will be investigated in this section .",
    "interestingly binney , ( 2004 ) found that for such systems the density near the center is very close to @xmath0 .",
    "this power law density suggests the possibility of a universal self - similar regime in the central region .",
    "binney ( 2004 ) proposed that the @xmath0 regime is valid for a very large class of initial conditions , but an interesting problem is to find for what type of initial conditions the @xmath0 is not obtained , and where is the limit . this problem may be solved by using the following simple approach , we take a set of cold initial conditions with power law densities and compute the density of the system at late times .",
    "the initial conditions are sampled by using @xmath126 particles , the phase space coordinates ( @xmath26,@xmath27 ) of these particles are initiated using random number generators .",
    "the @xmath26 positions are initiated using a power law random generator , while a gaussian random generator is used for the @xmath27 coordinates .",
    "the @xmath26 dimension random number generator is constructed by applying a power law transform to the output of a uniform random generator .",
    "the initial conditions are evolved using a leapfrog integrator ( birdsall & langdon , 1985 ) .",
    "the leapfrog is a symplectic integrator which is particularly important for reconstructing the structure of phase space .",
    "the leapfrog method requires the evaluation of the force at the position of each particle which is computed by subtracting the total mass on each side of the particle .",
    "no smoothing is applied to the force .",
    "the final step is to evaluate the proper time step for the leapfrog integration .",
    "the time step must be small enough to allow a proper reconstruction of the shortest orbits in the system .",
    "the shortest orbits are the closest to the center of the system . assuming that the typical size of the system is unity if we require a dynamical range in @xmath26 of @xmath127 , the associated shortest distance is @xmath128 . in the pre - collapse regime",
    "the fall time of a particle @xmath129 to the center depends on the initial mass @xmath130 inside the particle shell . in a system with initial power law density @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "the proper time step for leapfrog integration should be a fraction of @xmath129 ; numerical experiments show that a fraction of @xmath133 is optimal .",
    "another point is the estimation of the initial velocity dispersion @xmath134 .",
    "basically the resolution in the velocity space @xmath134 has to match the resolution in @xmath26 space @xmath135 .",
    "the velocity at the center of a particle with initial distance @xmath135 should be of the order of @xmath134 , which corresponds to @xmath136 . note that the above calculations of @xmath129 and @xmath134 are not fully analytic for @xmath37 , in this case the mass @xmath130 was computed directly from the initial conditions .",
    "the results of the 1d numerical simulations are presented in fig  [ pow0 ] .",
    "the resolution adopted corresponds to @xmath137 . for a better numerical efficiency , in the range @xmath138 the power law exponent of the force @xmath139",
    "is computed , the force is much smoother than the density ( affected by caustics ) , the equivalent projected density exponent , is @xmath140 .",
    "for @xmath141 the power law exponent was computed directly by fitting a power law to the density .",
    "interestingly the initial exponent @xmath142 is conserved at later time for @xmath143 , while for larger values of @xmath142 the final exponent has a constant value of @xmath1 ( see fig [ pow0 ] ) . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath0 density at the center is not universal but does occur precisely when @xmath144 .",
    "note that this effect was also noticed by schulz _",
    "( 2012 ) with results quite similar to fig [ pow0 ] .",
    "this particular behavior suggests a cut - off , no final exponent is larger than @xmath1 . to understand the cause of this cut - off it is interesting to investigate numerical simulations with initial conditions @xmath145 and look for the first appearance of the @xmath0 power law",
    "this analysis is illustrated for @xmath146 , the first appearance of the @xmath0 projected density occurs when the the first fold starts to form or equivalently just after the first crossing of particles with opposite velocities at the center . the phase space structure at this time",
    "is presented in fig  [ pow2 ] , we notice that near the center we have two caustics .",
    "these two caustics are very close to the center and according to the theory of singularities for a one dimensional density , we expect that their projected density will go like @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is a coordinate centered on the caustic .",
    "this is just what we obtain in fig  [ pow1 ]",
    ". the lower fold ( red points in fig  [ pow2 ] ) has a projected density close to @xmath147 near the center .",
    "this density starting from the caustics extends at distances significantly larger than the separation between the caustic and the center , which means that in a large portion of this regime @xmath149 and that as a consequence the density goes like @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath147 regime assume that the phase space density along the fold is constant , but due to the high non - linearity at the crossing the stretching of the phase space is large which implies that the density along the fold is nearly constant in a significant domain .",
    "this density associated with the caustic initiate the @xmath0 asymptotic regime at the center and since it is dominant for @xmath150 it is prone to extend to larger values of @xmath26 . at later times",
    "the system forms a large number of folds , with the persistence of the initial caustic induced @xmath0 regime at the center .",
    "the @xmath0 central regime is also present for other initial conditions , for instance , a gaussian , 2 gaussian , .. , and many other , but the difference is that even if this regime is present very close to the center we find also a rather brutal transition to a tiny area with nearly constant density .",
    "this transition occurs at the very center of the system , and the size of this constant region depends on the initial conditions .",
    "this constant region at the center is probably a remain of the nearly flat density present in some initial conditions .",
    "the transition from the @xmath0 regime to the constant density regime signal also a break of the self similar regime . in any case",
    "the existence of this small constant region affect the extent of the @xmath0 regime which is still present and most likely for the same reasons that for power law initial conditions . for a further investigation of this issue",
    "it is interesting to point the contribution of colombi & touma ( 2012 ) on this particular topic .",
    "it is important to note that in the central region of all numerical simulations self - similarity was observed ( see fig  [ self_plot ] for an illustration ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 of the density implies @xmath151 , which means that in the @xmath26 dimension the simulation should scale like @xmath152 and in the @xmath27 dimension like @xmath153 .",
    "using these scalings the folds at different times should be at the same location , which could be verified with good accuracy .",
    "this property definitely proves that the @xmath0 corresponds to a self similar regime in phase space . since analytic formula for the self - similar solution with power law density",
    "were derived in the former sections , it is interesting to check the consistency with the fold system .",
    "the fold system is illustrated in figs  [ pow3 ] and  [ pow4 ] .",
    "for power law initial conditions , it is expected that all quantities will be power laws , and thus the inter - fold distance should be given by eq [ fold_pos ] .",
    "the potential @xmath48 was computed , as well as @xmath154 , and finally the inter - fold distance @xmath155 was estimated .",
    "the results are presented in fig [ pow_f ] .",
    "the exponent of the inter - fold distance as a function of @xmath53 according to eq [ fold_pos ] is @xmath156 and provided that @xmath157 is deduced from the initial condition exponent @xmath142 , we have , @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "fig [ pow_f ] shows that this theoretical expectation of @xmath160 is in good agreement with the numerical estimations .",
    "it is interesting to note that we expect that the theoretical expectation of @xmath160 is going to match the data for @xmath161 , but for @xmath162 we would expect @xmath163 and not @xmath164 .",
    "this is not what is observed , and we must conclude that despite the @xmath0 law at the center the structure of the fold system is preserved for @xmath143 .",
    "other type of initial conditions imply different inter - fold distance , but this is always a small correction from the @xmath165 law . to conclude it is interesting to note that all solutions for a large class of initial conditions have power law densities with exponents close to @xmath1 at the center , and are all self - similar with the same similarity index at the center .",
    "this definitely indicates that the degree of freedom ( @xmath81 in eq [ sol_gen ] or @xmath166 in eq [ sol_r0 ] ) is important since it allows some flexibility to accommodate the initial conditions .",
    "all solutions have similar density at the center but have different phase space distributions while at the same time they remain self - similar .",
    "the final exponent is identical , but for @xmath150 a break occur and the final exponent saturates to @xmath1 , see text for more explanations .",

    "the blue folds are re - scaled using @xmath151 .",
    "the time - scale factor is equal to the ratio of the time from the beginning of the simulation for each fold system . ]",
    "the collapse of a dark matter halo in cosmological conditions is a very different problem from the 1d collapse investigated in the former section .",
    "the relation between the three dimensional collapse and self similarity was already explored by lithwick & dalal ( 2011 ) .",
    "here self similarity is imposed by the cosmological infall , the self similarity is not a consequence of a singularity at the center or of power law initial conditions . in cosmology",
    "the initial stage of the halo formation can be represented with the accretion of matter on a seed mass .",
    "this process implies that the turn - over radius of the in - falling shells of matter is a power law of time ( gunn 1977 , bertschinger , 1985 ) .",
    "the relevant similarity exponent in the notations of this paper is @xmath171 .",
    "the self similarity of the solution is enforced by the cosmological infall , which implies that the final solution should reflect the similarity of the infall ( taylor & navarro 2001 ) .",
    "thus we have good reasons to assume that the final outcome of the collapse of a dark matter halo will correspond to a self - similar solution of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "since dark matter is cold the solution will correspond to the multiple folds of the initial surface in phase space .",
    "however , an equilibrium or a near equilibrium situation is a very different problem for a smooth continuous system in phase - space and for the folding of a cold system in phase space .",
    "cold systems forms spiral in phase space and even in their late evolution they will be still evolving and will not converge to a smooth continuous equilibrium system .",
    "the smoothing of the spiral will produce a smooth phase - space density , and that smoothed density will be nearly stationary at late times .",
    "however in general the problem is that the smoothed density is not necessarily auto - similar .",
    "the smoothed density will correspond to the smooth auto - similar solution only in some special cases .",
    "this problem is due to the fact that the smoothed phase space density does not satisfy the ordinary vlasov equation but a different differential equation . since we can not relate the cold self - similar solutions to the smooth self - similar solutions we can not benefit from the fact that the smooth equilibrium solutions are simple analytic functions ( lancellotti & kiessling , 2000 ) .",
    "however it is clear that at late time the cold self similar solution should have a nearly stationary smoothed density in phase space and that it will correspond to a given sub - set of self similar solutions .",
    "the final problem is thus to identify the properties of this sub - set of solutions .",
    "a key point in the solution of this issue is to observe that even if the cold solution is discontinuous in phase space , the probability distribution of the phase space density @xmath172 could be similar to that of a smooth solution @xmath173 .",
    "actually if we consider the local surfaces of folds in phase space within some small solid angle , the integrated density between two local surfaces would correspond to the local surface multiplied by the thickness of the fold .",
    "the integration and averaging of the density between two folds corresponds to the smoothing operation .",
    "if the fold thickness is proportional to the distance between the folds , then the smoothed density will be proportional to the cold un - smoothed density , and its occurrence will also be proportional to the cold occurrence since it is proportional to the ratio between the thickness and the inter - fold distance .",
    "this reasoning shows that the smoothed probability density of @xmath114 can be deduced from the un - smoothed density by the introduction of constant scale factors ( see fig [ smooth ] for an illustration ) . as a consequence",
    "the self - similar properties of the cold probability distribution will be also valid for the smooth probability distribution .",
    "note that @xmath114 is made of many different contours , but since the scaling properties between @xmath2 and @xmath3 are valid for each contour , the transfer of self similarity between @xmath2 and @xmath3 remain valid in presence of many different contours .",
    "the property of proportionality between the thickness and the inter fold distance was demonstrated in sec .",
    "6 , but is also required for the existence of the solution . if the thickness exceeds the inter fold distance then a crossing would occur near the origin , while if the opposite behavior happened the crossing would happen on larger distances .",
    "the only solution is thus that the fold thickness is proportional to the fold inter distance . as a consequence",
    "it is clear that the smooth probability distribution inherit the self similar properties of the cold solution , and that power - law integrated quantities estimated from @xmath173 should have an auto - similar behavior .",
    "note that a priori the equivalence between @xmath172 and @xmath173 is valid on any sub domain of the phase space , provided that this domain is large enough to define the statistics of @xmath114 .",
    "in particular all quantities like : @xmath174 @xmath175 have to be self similar since @xmath176 @xmath175 is self - similar and @xmath3 inherits the self similarity of @xmath2 . as a consequence",
    "the smooth self - similar @xmath177 function should write as a power law of time multiplied with a function of @xmath178 .",
    "a direct estimate of the mean value of @xmath114 @xmath179 is : @xmath180 in the same spirit one may approximate @xmath177 : @xmath181 the ratio of @xmath177 quantities is also self - similar : @xmath182 since @xmath177 and @xmath183 are smooth continuous functions and self similar : @xmath184 and @xmath185 stationary solutions for @xmath177 and @xmath183 implies that @xmath186 and @xmath187 are power law s , thus : @xmath188^{\\gamma_1}=r^{\\gamma_1 }   \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\gamma_1= n \\frac{\\alpha_0}{\\alpha_1 } = -n \\frac{15}{8}\\ ] ] similarly : @xmath189^{\\gamma_2}=r^{\\gamma_2 }   \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\gamma_2=-(n - m)\\frac{15}{8}\\ ] ] ( note that we assume isotropic systems , thus @xmath8 was replaced with the distance modulus @xmath96 . )",
    "+ the calculation of integrals involving higher order power of f ( @xmath190 , @xmath191 ) requires the knowledge of the spatial distribution of @xmath114 .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath114 from numerical discrete numerical data is a difficult and uneasy task ( see arad , dekel , & klypin , 2004 ) . a more convenient way of estimating the higher order terms is to use the accurate analytic approximations of @xmath114 that were developed by wojtak , _ etal _",
    "all integrals were performed using eq 29 from wojtak , _ etal _ ( 2008 ) .",
    "the results are presented in figs  [ mam2 ] and  [ mam1 ] . for convenience an",
    "inverse power law s of higher order quantities was taken to reduce all self similar exponents to the @xmath192 theoretical self - similar expectation .",
    "all quantities are nearly linear in the log - log diagram , and all slopes in this diagram are very close to @xmath192 .",
    "the only possible explanation is that if all moments of the smooth probability distribution @xmath173 are self similar is that @xmath173 itself is self similar . as a consequence the universal behavior observed for cdm haloes in numerical simulations reflects the self similarity of @xmath173 .",
    "the convergence of cold initial conditions with initial density profile not steeper that @xmath0 to a universal power law density with exponent @xmath1 ( the binney conjecture , bc ) is an interesting and powerful example of universality .",
    "the one dimensional solutions are quite simple , and the bc is a very useful and efficient tool to explore self similarity .",
    "the conjecture implies that a large class of self similar solutions forms at the center of collapsed systems .",
    "the analytic solutions developed in this paper help to understand the general properties of the solutions , and the basic mechanism at the origin of the conjecture , which is related to a singularity has been identified .",
    "however the full richness and complexity of the 1d self similar solutions have yet to be explored , and the bc provides a very interesting method to generate a large class of self similar solutions .",
    "the final self similar solution will depend on the initial conditions , and it is clear that more complicated and exotic initial conditions have to be explored .",
    "the problem of the 3d cold collapse in a cosmological context , is somewhat different since the similarity is not due to a singularity but is enforced by the nature of the infall . in 3d simulations of dark matter haloes the pseudo phase space density @xmath4 is an universal power law .",
    "it was proved that this similarity is not the only one , and that other moments of the probability distribution of @xmath114 have the same universal properties .",
    "the convergence to a power law of all these quantities is due to the self similarity of the probability distribution of the smoothed @xmath114 , which is inherited from the self similarity of the original distribution .",
    "interestingly it was shown by dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) that the @xmath4 universal power law implied universal density profiles , not exactly nfw profiles , but quite close .",
    "it is interesting to point that the nfw profile itself may be understood usimg simple physics ( dalal , n. , lithwick , y. , kuhlen , m. , 2010 ) . as a consequence",
    "one may conclude that all the universality properties of the dark matter haloes are related the self similarity of the probability distribution of the smoothed @xmath114 , @xmath173 .",
    "a final point is that as expected , the self similar properties of @xmath173 are also present for the one dimensional solutions presented in this paper , and that higher order moment of @xmath173 are also power laws , which is a fundamental property of self similar solutions .",
    "a fundamental and natural perspective is to extend this work to real galaxies where not only dark matter is present but also baryonic matter .",
    "it is remarkable that the rotation curves of galaxies show also some universal similarity properties ( donato _ etal _ 2009 , salucci _ etal _ 2007 . )",
