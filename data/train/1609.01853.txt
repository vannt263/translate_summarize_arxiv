    "when materials absorb or release heat , their temperature varies in general .",
    "however , if a phase change occurs in materials , then the temperature only slightly varies , even though a large amount of energy is stored or released . only after the phase change is over does the temperature begin to rise or fall significantly .",
    "therefore , materials with a phase change , or phase - change materials ( pcms ) , are of great interest in the applications where there is demand for thermal energy storage with a high density ( within a small temperature range ) and/or where a temperature level needs to be maintained .",
    "examples are solar energy storage @xcite , space heating and cooling of buildings @xcite , cold storage applications @xcite , data storage applications @xcite , and industrial applications in textiles and clothing systems @xcite .",
    "it is well known that during a phase change between two phases ( such as melting / freezing between a solid and liquid phase ) the enthalpy vs.  temperature plot shows a sudden jump , while the heat capacity vs.  temperature plot shows a distinct peak .",
    "the presence of such rounded jumps and peaks is attributed mostly to non - equilibrium effects ; if heat exchange were carried out quasistatically and the studied sample were macroscopically _",
    "large _ , the jumps and peaks would become infinitely sharp . in some experiments ,",
    "however , heat capacity peaks keep their finite width even at rather slow heating rates @xcite .",
    "for example , when adiabatic scanning calorimetry ( asc ) is applied , very slow scanning rates can be achieved ( down to @xmath4 ) so that thermodynamic equilibrium of the investigated samples is ensured @xcite .",
    "this suggests that finite jumps and peaks need not be a pure non - equilibrium phenomenon , but it should be possible to obtain them even within an equilibrium approach .    in this paper",
    "we wish to present such an approach and demonstrate that it can predict rounded jumps / peaks from experiments with very good accuracy .",
    "the approach is based on the observation that the crystalline state of pcms has usually a polycrystalline structure , being composed of many single - crystalline grains some of which have just few tens of nanometers in diameter @xcite .",
    "we thus propose to interpret an experimentally measured jump / peak as a superposition of many contributions coming from the individual grains ( see section  [ sec : poly ] ) . due to finite - size effects , the jumps / peaks from the _ small _ grains are sharp , yet of finite width .",
    "in addition , they are mutually shifted .",
    "therefore , when they are superimposed , the so obtained result can fit experimental data with very good precision ( see section  [ sec : appl ] ) .",
    "the starting point of our approach is a microscopic theory @xcite from which enthalpy jumps and heat capacity peaks in a single grain can be obtained ( see section  [ sec : single ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that lately there has been a number of studies of pcms using various microscopic techniques , such as molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , density - functional calculations @xcite , a cellular automata approach @xcite , classical nucleation theory simulations @xcite , and a statistical theory of crystallization @xcite .",
    "most of these works focus on specific materials ( one or more of the alloys ge@xmath5sb@xmath5te@xmath6 , sb@xmath5te@xmath7 , gete , aginsbte , and ga - sb ) due to their practical importance in digital memory technologies .    as a specific material",
    ", we shall consider a paraffin - based pcm called rubitherm rt  @xmath0 in which a change between a solid and liquid phase is used to store / release thermal energy in various civil engineering applications .",
    "its enthalpy and heat capacity were measured in @xcite using adiabatic scanning calorimetry .",
    "thus , it should be plausible to apply a quasistatic approach to describe these results in which the enthalpy has a single distinct jump and the heat capacity has a single distinct peak .",
    "the phase - change temperature was determined to be @xmath1 for heating and @xmath8 for cooling .",
    "we shall focus on the heating part of the temperature dependences ( the corresponding experimental data are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : data ] and listed in table  [ tab : rt data ] ) , because , on closer inspection , they are more representative than those for the cooling run .     obtained from asc measurements performed in @xcite . either thick line represents more than @xmath9 thousand data points .",

    "we shall consider a phase change that occurs between two phases . then a jump in the specific enthalpy , @xmath10 , is expected to interpolate between the specific enthalpies , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , of the two phases ; i.e. ,    [ eq : h , c single ] @xmath13 where the quantity @xmath14 describes the precise form of the interpolation . since @xmath15",
    ", it has the meaning of a normalized enthalpy and is dimensionless .",
    "it is further expected that a peak in the heat capacity , @xmath16 , is the sum of the excess and baseline heat capacities , @xmath17 similarly to @xmath10 , the baseline capacity should interpolate between the heat capacities , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , of the two phases , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the corresponding interpolation function .",
    "on the other hand , the excess capacity has the shape of a peak , for it is associated with the phase change itself .",
    "it may be written as the product @xmath22    where @xmath23 is its maximal value ( about two orders of magnitude larger than the single - phase capacities @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , and @xmath24 is a dimensionless quantity describing the peak in @xmath25 .    at present",
    "there is no universal microscopic theory of phase changes for realistic models of materials that would predict jumps in the enthalpy and peaks in the heat capacity as given in eqs .  . nevertheless , for simplified models , called lattice gases , such a general theory was already developed @xcite",
    "it is appropriate only for processes in which temperature changes are performed quasistatically .",
    "moreover , since lattice gases are suitable for the description of changes between crystalline phases , a pcm that we can thus describe must have a perfect , single - crystal microstructure .",
    "this is plausible for a solid phase of the studied pcm , but it is somewhat approximative for a liquid phase .    if we invoke the theory from @xcite , then the results from eqs .",
    "can be indeed obtained .",
    "namely , it follows that the two interpolating functions are identical , @xmath26 , and can be both approximated by the function @xmath27 , while the peak function @xmath28 can be approximated by the function @xmath29 .",
    "the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 are similar in shape to the gaussian error function and bell curve , respectively , but they approach their limiting values at a slower , exponential rate . the shorthand @xmath32 and the maximal value @xmath23 are given as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the temperature of the phase change , @xmath35 is the specific latent heat associated with the change , @xmath36 is the sample mass ( assumed to be constant ) , and @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "should coincide with @xmath23 , @xmath51 , and @xmath38 , respectively",
    ". this might be perhaps true for samples of just few nanometers in size , such as for nano - encapsulated pcms @xcite .",
    "however , for samples of few micrometers in diameter , eq .   with @xmath34 and @xmath52 from table  [ tab : rt data ] predicts a peak that is about _ eight orders of magnitude sharper and taller _ than the one observed experimentally ( if the latent heat is kept unchanged ) . in fact , the same conclusion follows for any pcm for which the heat capacity peak has the height @xmath23 , half - width @xmath51 , and area ( latent heat ) @xmath38 of orders @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the theoretical description based on eqs .   and can not be used to accurately reproduce various experimental data , and a more sophisticated approach must be adopted .",
    "the main reason why eqs .   and yield results that may be inconsistent with experiment is the assumption that a pcm has a perfect , single - crystalline microstructure .",
    "if we consider a pcm that is polycrystalline , consisting of a number of single - crystal grains , then we will be able to fit experimental data with theoretical results with very good precision .",
    "a single - crystalline pcm is a special case when there is just one grain .",
    "the grains , @xmath56 , may be of various sizes and their surroundings may affect them in different ways . for simplicity , we will assume that the grains are of spherical shape and mutually independent ( non - interacting ) and that possible effects of void spaces between the grains are neglected .",
    "then the enthalpy and heat capacity of a pcm sample is the sum of the enthalpies and heat capacities coming from its individual grains .",
    "the specific enthalpy and capacity may thus be expressed as the weighted averages , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , of the grain specific enthalpies , @xmath59 , and capacities , @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the weight of a given grain @xmath61 is equal to the fraction of its mass in the sample .",

    " to @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( with the sample mass @xmath36 and sample surface @xmath43 replaced by the grain mass , @xmath62 , and grain surface , @xmath63 , respectively ) , we get    [ eq : h , c poly ] @xmath64 with @xmath65    these results have the same form as for single - crystalline samples :    * the specific enthalpy interpolates between the single - phase specific enthalpies @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; * the specific heat capacity is the sum of the excess and baseline heat capacities ; * the excess heat capacity is the product of @xmath23 and a dimensionless peak function ; * the baseline capacity interpolates between the single - phase specific heat capacities @xmath18 and @xmath19 , similarly to the enthalpy .",
    "this time , however , the interpolation is described by the average @xmath66 of the grain jump functions @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , the capacity peak is described by the average @xmath68 of the products @xmath69 of the weights and gain peak functions @xmath70 , because @xmath71 $ ] with @xmath72 . in the special case of a single - crystalline pcm ,",
    "there is only one grain @xmath56 with @xmath73 , and eq .",
    "reduces back to eqs .  .",
    "we anticipate that eq",
    ".   can predict _ much wider and smaller _ heat capacity peaks and much wider enthalpy jumps for polycrystalline pcms than for single - crystalline pcms . indeed ,",
    "if a pcm is composed of many grains , then the jump and peak functions @xmath67 and @xmath70 from different grains are mutually shifted and of various widths , depending on the grain sizes and surface effects .",
    "therefore , when multiplied by the ( usually very small ) terms @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , and summed together , the resulting averages @xmath76 and @xmath77 could be much wider and , in the latter case , much smaller . moreover , the positions of @xmath67 and @xmath70 for different grains are inversely proportional to the grain diameter ( @xmath78 ) . hence , @xmath67 and @xmath70 are unevenly distributed in a given temperature range , so that their averages @xmath76 and @xmath77 and , therefore , the enthalpy jumps and heat capacity peaks are expected to be _ asymmetric _ in general , in agreement with experimental data .    in the following it",
    "is sufficient to focus on the excess heat capacity @xmath25 , because the baseline heat capacity @xmath46 and enthalpy @xmath10 are obtained from the average @xmath76 by eq .  , and",
    "the latter can be calculated from @xmath25 by integration , @xmath79 as can be easily verified .    to evaluate the excess heat capacity @xmath25",
    ", we shall rewrite it in a more convenient form , using the pcm density , @xmath52 , and grain diameter , @xmath80 , both evaluated at the phase - change temperature @xmath34 .",
    "we express the grain mass and surface as @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "then the variations in the grain heat capacities @xmath60 between various grains are only due to the grain diameter @xmath80 and its surface free energy difference @xmath42 ( see eqs .   and ) .",
    "so , if we classify the grains according to their values of @xmath80 and @xmath42 , we may express the excess heat capacity as a double sum , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a diameter of the pcm sample at @xmath34 .",
    "the first sum is over all grain diameters @xmath85 .",
    "the second sum is over all values @xmath86 of the surface free energy differences in the grains of a fixed diameter @xmath87 ; the number of these grains is denoted as @xmath88 .",
    "the quantity @xmath89 is the fraction of the grains of diameter @xmath87 whose value of the surface free energy difference is @xmath90 .",
    "the shorthand @xmath91 stands for @xmath32 evaluated for a grain with a diameter @xmath87 and @xmath90 .    since the numbers @xmath88 and weights @xmath89 are unknown for rubitherm rt  @xmath0",
    ", we shall consider simple forms of these weights to obtain an explicit formula for @xmath25 from eq .  .",
    "we will assume that the grains are created in a random process so that the boundary conditions for various grains are irregular , which is why @xmath42 changes from one grain to another .",
    "we let @xmath92 denote the mean value of @xmath42 . in addition , since we consider @xmath42 to be random and related to the grain boundary , we shall assume that its fluctuation ( standard deviation ) is inversely proportional to the square root of the number @xmath93 of atoms lying on the grain boundary , @xmath94 .",
    "thus , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a constant .",
    "taking the values @xmath86 to be equally spread , for simplicity , we may approximate @xmath89 for a grain of diameter @xmath87 by the gaussian form , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the distance between two adjacent values @xmath99 .    according to eqs .   and , the half - width and maximum positions of the grain peaks @xmath100 in the average @xmath101 from eq .",
    "are given by @xmath102 while the half - width is the same for all peaks @xmath100 in @xmath101 , their maximum positions vary proportionally to @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the peaks with different @xmath99 are spread over a range between the temperatures @xmath103 and @xmath104 corresponding to the maximal and minimal value @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "the dominant peaks @xmath100 in the average @xmath101 are , however , those with a high weight @xmath89 ; i.e. , the peaks corresponding to @xmath99 between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "these are spread over a narrower range of half - width @xmath109 the average @xmath101 strongly depends on the ratio of the half - widths @xmath110 and @xmath111 . indeed , if @xmath111 is much smaller than @xmath110 , there are only small shifts between the grain peaks @xmath100 , and the average @xmath101 is practically the same as a peak function for a single grain of diameter @xmath87 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath111 is much larger than @xmath110 , the grain peaks @xmath100 are spread over a wide temperature range , and the average @xmath101 is _ much wider and smaller _ than a grain peak ( see fig .",

    "the simplest case is that the diameters are equally spread and that there is an equal number of grains of a given diameter , @xmath125 where we used that @xmath126 must be equal to the total pcm volume @xmath127 .",

    "then we were able to obtain theoretical results for @xmath10 and @xmath16 that could be fitted to experimental data with very good precision .",
    "we used only four fitting parameters , including the specific latent heat @xmath38 and phase - change temperature @xmath34 .",
    "their values were adjusted from four characteristics of the excess heat capacity peak ( its area , maximum position , height , and asymmetry ) .",
    "the key points of our approach may be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we provided a procedure to separate the baseline and excess heat capacities for a phase change between two phases , using the experimental data on the enthalpy and heat capacity .",
    "2 .   the presented equilibrium approach predicts an asymmetric jump and peak in the enthalpy and heat capacity , respectively , as a result of finite - size effects .",
    "the specific latent heat @xmath38 was identified with the area of the peak in the excess heat capacity . for the considered pcm it formed @xmath140 % of the total enthalpy change in the range between @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "4 .   we determined the phase - change temperature @xmath34 from the height and maximum position of the peak in the excess heat capacity .",
    "its value was higher by @xmath178 than the quoted one .    since the microscopic structure of the studied material",
    "was not taken into account in depth , our results are quite robust and could be applied to other pcms . in addition , our results can be extended to the phase changes with coexistence of more than two phases , using the necessary modifications to the description of the single grain behavior .",
    "this may be a topic for a future investigation .",
    "a weak point of our approach is the obtained value of the phase - change temperature that is rather shifted from the maximum position of the measured heat capacity peak .",
    "this is a consequence of taking the mean value @xmath92 to be fixed for all grain sizes .",
    "we may improve the results by considering @xmath92 to be varying with @xmath179 over a range of values .",
    "then the half - width of this range would be an additional , fifth fitting parameter that must be determined from an additional property of the excess heat capacity peak . in this sense ,",
    "the presented approach uses a minimal number of fitting parameters .",
    "another weak point is the tacit assumption that the pcm phases are crystalline , which may be a crude approximation , especially for the liquid phase .",
    "in addition , it is farfetched to apply the theory of phase changes from @xcite to the behavior of grains in a real pcm .",
    "nevertheless , the precise shapes of the jump and peak functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 associated with the individual grains are not essential in the final results ( see eq .  ) , because such a detailed information is lost after their averages @xmath76 and @xmath77 over the grains are taken .",
    "finally , the presented approach is restricted to the quasistatic regime .",
    "thus , non - equilibrium effects are not considered , even though they may have an additional effect on the shape and position of the enthalpy jumps and heat capacity peaks .",
