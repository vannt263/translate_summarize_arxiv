    "the strong cp problem  @xcite of the standard model of particle physics is about the question why the strong cp violating parameter @xmath14 is smaller than @xmath15 , while the weak cp violating kobayashi - maskawa phase originating from the same quark yukawa couplings @xmath16 is of order unity . presently the most compelling solution to this problem is to introduce a non - linearly realized anomalous global u@xmath17 symmetry , the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry  @xcite , which predicts a pseudo - goldstone boson , the qcd axion , whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) can be identified as @xmath18  @xcite . yet",
    ", there still remain some questions .",
    "one question is , what is the origin of the pq symmetry ?",
    "the pq symmetry is required to be explicitly broken by the qcd anomaly , while being protected well from other forms of explicit breaking . in view of that global symmetry",
    "is not respected in general by uv physics at scales where quantum gravity becomes important  @xcite , the existence of such global symmetry at low energy scales may require a specific form of uv completion of the model  @xcite .",
    "another question is about the mechanism to determine the axion decay constant @xmath19 , which determines most of the phenomenological consequences of the qcd axion , including the cosmological ones .",
    "it has been known for many years that string theory provides an attractive theoretical framework to address these questions  @xcite .",
    "string theory includes a variety of higher - dimensional antisymmetric tensor gauge fields , whose zero modes behave like axions in the 4-dimensional effective theory .",
    "the shift symmetries associated with these axion - like fields are valid in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "it is then conceivable that a certain combination of the shift symmetries is broken dominantly by the qcd anomaly , and therefore can be identified as the pq symmetry solving the strong cp problem . as for the decay",
    "constant , if the compactification scale is comparable to the planck scale , the decay constants of such stringy axions are estimated to be  @xcite , [ axion_scale1 ] f_a ~ g^2m_pl/8 ^ 2 , where the factor @xmath20 comes from the convention for the axion decay constant , and @xmath21  gev is the reduced planck scale .",
    "although it is subject to severe cosmological constraints  @xcite , such qcd axion arising from antisymmetric tensor gauge fields in compactified string theory has been considered to be a viable possibility for many years",
    ".    an interesting generalization of this scheme , involving an anomalous u@xmath0 gauge symmetry with a nonzero u@xmath0-su@xmath22-su@xmath22 anomaly cancelled by the 4-dimensional green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism  @xcite , has been discussed before for the purpose of having an intermediate scale qcd axion even when the compactification scale is comparable to the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the compactification models in which moduli are stabilized at the point of vanishing u@xmath0 fayet - illiopoulos ( fi ) term @xmath23 in the supersymmetric limit , when all u@xmath0-charged matter fields @xmath24 are set to zero .",
    "such supersymmetric solutions are known to exist in many of the type ii string theory with @xmath8-branes  @xcite , as well as in the heterotic string theory with u@xmath17 gauge bundles  @xcite . in the limit of @xmath25 ,",
    "the u@xmath0 gauge boson obtains a superheavy mass @xmath26 by absorbing the stringy axion @xmath27 implementing the gs anomaly cancellation mechanism , while leaving an unbroken perturbative global u@xmath17 symmetry , which corresponds the global part of u@xmath0 without the transformation of @xmath27 . by construction , this perturbative global u@xmath17 symmetry has nonzero u@xmath17-su@xmath22-su@xmath22 anomaly , and therefore can be identified as the pq symmetry solving the strong cp problem .    to satisfy the astrophysical constraints on the qcd axion , this pq symmetry should be spontaneously broken at a scale higher than @xmath28  gev  @xcite .",
    "for this , some u@xmath0-charged matter field @xmath24 should have a tachyonic supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scalar mass @xmath3 , destabilizing the supersymmetric solution @xmath25 . the matter scalar field",
    "@xmath24 then takes a vacuum value @xmath29  gev by an interplay between the tachyonic susy breaking mass term and a supersymmetric higher order term which schematically takes the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 if the cutoff - scale of the model is assumed to be comparable to the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "this scheme to determine @xmath32 leads to an appealing connection between the axion scale and the susy breaking scale as [ axion_scale2 ] f_a ~ ( m_susy m_pl^n)^1/(n+1 ) ( n0 ) , which makes it possible that a wide range of the qcd axion decay constant much lower than the planck scale is obtained within the framework of string theory .",
    "the recent detection of tensor modes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by bicep2  @xcite has important implications for axion cosmology  @xcite , particularly for the string theoretic qcd axion .",
    "first of all , the bicep2 results imply that the inflation energy scale is about @xmath33  gev .",
    "this suggests that the string compactification scale is higher than @xmath33  gev , and therefore the estimate ( [ axion_scale1 ] ) of the decay constants of stringy axion - like fields is at least qualitatively correct . for the expansion rate @xmath34  gev ,",
    "if the pq symmetry were spontaneously broken during inflation , the corresponding qcd axion is severely constrained by the planck constraints on isocurvature density perturbations and non - gaussianity  @xcite . during inflation , so is free from the isocurvature and non - gaussianity constraints  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not likely to be realized in our theoretical framework , as @xmath35 is protected by both the shift symmetry broken only by non - perturbative effects and the softly broken susy during inflation with @xmath36 . ] as we will see , this rules out the simple possibility that the qcd axion corresponds to a combination of the zero modes of antisymmetric tensor fields in compactified string theory , having a decay constant @xmath37 . on the other hand , in the presence of an anomalous u@xmath0 gauge symmetry with vanishing fi term , under which the qcd axion is charged , the model can have rich symmetry breaking patterns during inflation , while giving a present axion decay constant much lower than @xmath38 .",
    "this may make it possible that the model allows a variety of different cosmologically viable scenarios .    in this paper , we examine the symmetry breaking pattern of the string theoretic qcd axion models involving an anomalous u@xmath0 gauge symmetry during the inflationary epoch with @xmath4  gev .",
    "we identify the allowed range of the axion decay constant in such models , as well as the corresponding relic axion abundance , being consistent with known cosmological constraints , within a general framework in which the axion scale during inflation can be different from the axion scale in the present universe .",
    "we note first that if the pq symmetry were broken during inflation , the cosmological constraints can be satisfied _ only _ when the axion scale during inflation is much higher than the present axion scale .",
    "the most natural setup to realize this possibility is to generate the axion scale through susy breaking effects .",
    "we show that indeed the string theoretic qcd axion models with anomalous u@xmath0 gauge symmetry provides such setup .",
    "if the modulus - axion superfield implementing the gs mechanism is _ not _ sequestered from the susy breaking by the inflaton sector , which would be the case in generic situations , u@xmath0-charged matter fields develop a large expectation value during inflation , ( t_i)~ ( h_i m_pl^n)^1/(n+1 ) , due to the tachyonic susy breaking scalar mass induced dominantly by the @xmath39 @xmath8-term : m^2_(t_i ) q_g^2_a d_a(t_i ) ~-8 ^ 2 h_i^2 , while ( t_0)~(m_susym_pl^n)^1/(n+1 ) , for the susy breaking scalar mass @xmath3 in the present universe .",
    "then the qcd axion during inflation has a much higher decay constant than the present value , and even is a different degree of freedom . as we will see , this makes it possible that a certain parameter space of the model is consistent with the constraints on isocurvature perturbations and non - gaussianity , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : axion ] in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the allowed range of the present axion decay constant for reasonable choice of model parameters is given by 10 ^ 9 gev f_a(t_0 ) 510 ^ 13 gev , where @xmath40  gev requires a fine - tuning of the axion misalignment angle as @xmath41 .",
    "if we assume @xmath42 , the allowed range is reduced to @xmath43@xmath44  gev , with the axion dark matter making up roughly @xmath45@xmath46  % of the total dark matter energy density .    on the other hand , if the modulus - axion superfield for the gs mechanism is sequestered from the susy breaking by the inflaton sector , so that the soft scalar masses during inflation are not dominated by the u@xmath0 @xmath8-term contribution , it is possible that ( t_i)=0 , so the pq symmetry is restored during inflation , while again ( t_0)~(m_susym_pl^n)^1/(n+1 ) , in the present universe . in this case , the model is free from the isocurvature and non - gaussianity constraints , however required to have the axion domain - wall number @xmath47 , which is a non - trivial constraint on the model building .",
    "furthermore , if one adopts the recent simulation for the axion production by axionic strings and domain walls  @xcite , only the following narrow window of the axion decay constant 10 ^ 9  gev f_a(t_0 ) ( ) 10 ^ 10  gev is allowed by the astrophysical and cosmological constraints , where the relic axions can account for the total dark matter energy density when @xmath48 saturates the upper bound .",
    "our results have an intriguing implication for the size of susy breaking soft masses in the present universe . regardless of whether the pq symmetry is broken or not during inflation , the cosmologically allowed parameter region for a natural axion misalignment angle @xmath42 points to two possibilities : & i ) & m_susy~ f_a(t_0 ) ~ 10 ^ 9 - 10 ^ 11  gev , + & ii ) & m_susy~ f_a^2(t_0)/m_pl ~10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4  gev .",
    "the results for the case of broken pq symmetry during inflation suggest also that the axion isocurvature density perturbations have an amplitude close to the present observational bound .",

    ", we examine the cosmological constraints on the qcd axion , while taking into account that the axion decay constant during inflation can be much higher than the present value . although we consider here a specific type of string motivated models , it should be noted that our results apply to generic supersymmetric axion models in which the pq breaking scale is generated by susy breaking effects . in section [ sec : fa ] , we present a simple 4-dimensional supergravity ( sugra ) model involving both the inflaton sector and the u@xmath0 sector , and examine possible symmetry breaking patterns during inflation .",

    "such effects include for instance the stringy - instantons wrapping @xmath53 , as well as the axion couplings to the low energy gauge field instantons , which are induced as c_pff _ m_4 _ stff _ _ p _ p. it is then a conceivable possibility that stringy instanton effects are negligible for the shift symmetry ( [ shift ] ) , at least in the limit that the @xmath49-cycle @xmath53 is large enough .",

    ", one finds that the upper bound on @xmath122 from the isocurvature constraint is smaller than the value obtained by the relation ( [ iso - cond ] ) .",
    "obviously high scale inflation puts strong constraints on the possible range of the axion scale and relic abundance , which may be satisfied by having a larger decay constant during inflation  @xcite . as will be discussed in more detail in section [ sec : fa ] , in models with anomalous u@xmath0 gauge symmetry , one can easily obtain f_a(t_i ) ~ f_st= m_pl = o(10 ^ -1 - 10 ^ -2)m_pl , with v(t_i ) ~(h_im_pl^n ) ^1/(n+1 ) f_st , for a reasonable range of model parameters and @xmath131  gev .",

    "we also show the result for a fixed value of the misalignment angle , @xmath140 in the magenta dot - dashed and dotted lines for @xmath141  gev .",

    "the value of @xmath144 lies in the range between about @xmath33 and @xmath7  gev , independently of the details of moduli stabilization .",
    "then the isocurvature constraint requires the axion decay constant at present to be [ fa - bound ] f_a(t_0 ) < 7.1 10 ^ 13gev ( ) ^1.68 , as can be seen from the relation ( [ combined - cond ] ) by taking @xmath145 , and also from fig .",

    "if this were the case , one is again led to either the axion scale susy ( @xmath103 ) , m_susy ~v(t_0 ) ~10 ^ 9 - 10 ^ 11 gev , or the low scale susy ( @xmath104 ) with m_susy~ ~10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 gev , because the axion scale is determined by @xmath149 , and sizable suppression of axion fluctuations is achieved for @xmath150 ( see also section [ sec : fa ] ) .",

    "in this section , we examine the pq symmetry breaking both at present and during inflation in the context of simple supergravity model involving the @xmath39 and inflaton sectors .",
    "we begin with a configuration with vanishing fi term , _",

    "note that inflation is driven along the @xmath164 direction by the @xmath123-term potential of @xmath159 . in the present universe ,",
    "the inflaton sector fields are settled at @xmath165 , and susy breaking is due to the @xmath123-term of the polonyi - like field : f^z 3 m_3/2m_pl , where @xmath86 is the gravitino mass in the present universe with nearly vanishing cosmological constant . on the other hand , during inflation ,",
