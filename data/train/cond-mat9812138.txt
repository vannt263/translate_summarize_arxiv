    "the physics of driven diffusive systems has attracted much attention recently @xcite due to their relevance to the general area of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and their wide range of possible potential applications . in particular , the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite and its generalizations@xcite have been studied within the context of tribophysics .",
    "braun and coworkers @xcite studied the atomic current in one and two - dimensional atomic systems in the presence of a periodic potential under the influence of a dc driving force within the approach of langevin equations . in tribophysics ,",
    "the driving force emerges owing to the motion of one of the two substrates separarted by a thin atomic layer .",
    "the results of these studies are characterized by two features .",
    "one feature is that the system exhibits hysteresis in response to the driving force .",
    "the system jumps between low - mobility and high - mobility regimes in a hysteretic manner as a function of the driving force .",
    "another feature is that accompanying this transition , the atoms tend to organize themselves into two types of domains consisting of atoms in states of different characters , one consisting of slowly moving (  immobile \" ) atoms and another consisting of  running \" atoms moving with maximum speed .",
    "the latter feature resembles those in traffic flow models@xcite in which cars may be moving at its maximum speed if they are not blocked or may be momentarily stationary if they are blocked in front .",
    "the models studied in ref.@xcite are quite complicated .",
    "attempts have been made @xcite to introduce simpler models which capture the essential features . in a series of three lattice gas ( lg ) models of increasing complexity ( henceforth referred to as lg models a , b , and c ) , braun _",
    "_ introduced probabilistic hoppings of atoms on a lattice together with the possibility of the atoms being found in one of two possible states .",
    "the underlying model ( lg model a ) in one dimension is that @xmath0 atoms are placed in a lattice of length @xmath1 corresponding to a concentration of @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics is introduced in a random and sequential fashion by randomly choosing a site at each time step and updating the system according to specific rules .",
    "the hopping to the nearest neighbouring sites of an immobile atom in a randomly chosen site is characterized by a probability @xmath3  ( @xmath4 ) that an atom hops into the site in the right ( left ) hand side .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath3 models the effect of a driving force , and the hoppings to the right and left hand sides correspond to the effects of drift together with diffusion .",
    "atoms in the running state always attempt to hop to the right , which is taken to be the direction of the driving force .",
    "the @xmath5 case corresponds to vanishing bias field .",
    "the @xmath6 case corresponds to the totally asymmetric exclusion model , which has been solved exactly @xcite .",
    "an atom in the immobile state changes to the running state if it succeeds in hopping to the right hand side , while a running atom becomes immobile if the site to the right is occupied by an atom in the immobile state .",
    "such transitions between the immobile and running states of an atom model the effects of damping .",
    "lg model a is thus characterized by the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "lg model b includes the possibility that the running atom at a randomly chosen site may change to the immobile state with probability @xmath8 prior to the motion of the atom takes place .",
    "this spontaneous convection from the running to the immobile state is supposed to be more important for weak driving forces . in order to capture the features of hysteresis , braun _",
    "et al._@xcite went on to include in the basic model a majority rule in the conversion between the two states of the atoms .",
    "if the randomly chosen site is occupied by the leading atom in a compact group of @xmath9 running atoms and it is blocked by a compact group of @xmath10 immobile atoms in front , all the @xmath11 atoms will turn into the immobile ( running ) state if @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these three models have the advantage of being easily implemented numerically by carrying out monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is useful to study similar models within the context of dynamical systems .",
    "a physical consideration is that parallel updatings of the states of the atoms may be more appropriate than the sequential updatings in the lg models studied in ref.@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we propose analogous models with parallel updating rules in that all the atoms evolve in every time step according to updating rules , and hence the models become cellular automaton ( ca ) .",
    "we performed numerical simulations on the models .",
    "another advantage of casting the models in terms of parallel updating rules is that a more systematic analytical approach , analogous to those successfully applied to traffic flow models@xcite , may be applicable .",
    "such approach focuses on the time evolution on the state of each of the sites , namely whether the site is occupied by an atom in the running or immobile state or unoccupied .",
    "in general , spatial correlations of gradually increasing spatial extent are introduced as time evolves .",
    "equations can be written down relating the state of a site at time @xmath14 to quantities at time @xmath15 . by suitably decoupling the spatial correlations , a set of coupled nonlinear equations",
    "can be obtained with the fixed point corresponding to the solution in the long time limit .",
    "the complexity of the set of equations depends on the extent of spatial correlations retained after decoupling .",
    "the approach has the advantage that it gives the fraction of running atoms in the steady state together with other spatial correlation functions . as an illustration of the general idea of the approach",
    ", we study models a and b with parallel updating rules and results are found to be in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations within the approximation of retaining correlations upto two sites . the present work , therefore , complements that of braun _ et al . _ @xcite and suggests an alternative way of studying the various models proposed within the context of tribology .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii , we define the modified models with parallel updating rules and present the results obtained by numerical simulations . section iii reports results of our analytical calculations on model a and b. results are compared with numerical simulations .",
    "we summarize the results in sec.iv .",
    "we consider @xmath0 atoms on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath1 sites with periodic boundary condition . following the basic lattice gas model@xcite , we modify the rules such that parallel updating is incorporated .",
    "the updating rules are :    _ rule a1 _ : if the @xmath16th site on the lattice at time @xmath15 is occupied by an immobile atom , it has a probability @xmath3 to be in the advancing immobile state , i.e. , state that flavours forward biasing and a probability @xmath4 to be in the retreating immobile state , i.e. , state that flavours backward hopping .",
    "an advancing immobile atom can either hop into the _ empty _",
    "( @xmath17)th site _ and become a running atom _ if the ( @xmath18)th site is _ not _ occupied by a retreating atom or be blocked by an atom occupying the ( @xmath17)th site without changing its state , while a retreating atom can either hop into the _ empty _",
    "( @xmath19)th site _ and stay in the immobile state",
    "_ if the ( @xmath20)th site is _ not _ occupied by a running or an advancing immobile atom or be blocked by an atom occupying the ( @xmath19)th site without changing its state .",
    "_ rule a2 _ : if the @xmath16th site on the lattice at time @xmath15 is occupied by a running atom , it can move to the _ empty _",
    "( @xmath17)th site if the ( @xmath18)th site is _ not _ occupied by a retreating atom or stay at the @xmath16th site and remain in the running state if it is blocked by a running atom or _ change to the immobile state _ if it is blocked by an immobile atom at the ( @xmath17)th site .",
    "_ rule a3 _ : if the @xmath16th site on the lattice at time @xmath15 is empty and is sandwiched between a running or advancing immobile atom at the ( @xmath19)th site and a retreating immobile atom at the ( @xmath17)th site , then the atoms at the two neighboring sites are equally probable to hop into the @xmath16th site according to rules a1 and a2 .",
    "the atom that fails to hop at that time step will remain in its original state .",
    "model a thus represents a modification of the lg model a in ref.@xcite with parallel updating rules .",
    "the quantity of interest is the mobility @xmath21 of the system which is defined as the fraction of atoms in the running state in the long time limit .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations on model a. figure 1 shows the dependence of the mobility @xmath21 as a function of the drift parameter @xmath3 for different concentrations of atoms @xmath7 .",
    "note that only the range @xmath22 corresponding to a biased field to the right hand side is shown , although the range @xmath23 can also be studied taking model a as a ca model in its own right . to illustrate the basic features of the model",
    ", we have performed numerical simulations on systems with @xmath24 .",
    "typically , about 2000 time steps are sufficient for approaching the long time limit .",
    "the mobility @xmath21 is obtained simply by counting the fraction of running atoms in the long time limit . for @xmath25 , an average over 50 random initial configurations",
    "are performed . for @xmath26 , @xmath27 for @xmath28 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the mobility @xmath21 becomes unity at some critical value @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the concentration is sufficiently high so that @xmath32 for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "the particular point of @xmath6 deserves further discussion .",
    "it is found that for @xmath31 , the mobility @xmath21 at @xmath6 in the long time limit depends on the initial condition .",
    "the results at @xmath33 shown in fig.1 correspond to @xmath34 , which are obtained by using the initial configuration in which all the atoms are immobile . for arbitrary initial configurations at @xmath33 , @xmath21",
    "is found to lie within the range @xmath35 .",
    "similar results are obtained in our analytical approach , discussed in the next section , by treating the model as a dynamical system .",
    "model a forms the basic ca model for further modifications .",
    "in particular , while irreversible transition into the running state for an isolated atom is strongly favourable in the high - field limit ( @xmath36 ) , it is possible for a running atom to convert spontaneously to the immobile state in the weak field case . following the lg model b in ref.@xcite",
    ", we introduce the following rule in addition to the rules a1 , a2 , and a3 stated above :    _ rule b1 _ : before the updating rules a1 , a2 , a3 are applied in each time step , every atom in the running state has a probability @xmath8 to change its state to the immobile state and a probability @xmath37 to remain in the running state .",
    "after this consideration , all the atoms on the lattice evolve according to the rules a1 , a2 , and a3 .",
    "rules b1 , a1 , a2 , and a3 define the ca model b. while @xmath3 tends to lead to a larger fraction of running atom , the parameter @xmath8 counteracts the effect and tends to increase the number of atoms in the immobile state .",
    "hence , the mobility @xmath21 is generally lower for @xmath38 cases than the @xmath39 case for the same value of @xmath3 .",
    "figure 2 shows the values of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath3 for different values of @xmath8 with the concentration fixed at @xmath40 , which corresponds to a concentration at which the atoms are isolated if they are uniformly distributed on the lattice .",
    "note that the mobilities converge to unity at @xmath6 for different values of @xmath8 .",
    "only when @xmath41 will the mobility becomes unity for @xmath42 .",
    "the results shown are typical for @xmath43 .",
    "figure 3 shows the results for @xmath44 , which corresponds to a concentration at which there are always some atoms with nearest neighbors if they are uniformly distributed on the lattice . in this case ,",
    "@xmath32 for all values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the mobilities converge to the same value for different values of @xmath8 at @xmath6 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "model b reduces to model a and the mobility @xmath21 lies in the range @xmath35 with the precise value depending on the initial condition .      following the lg model c in ref.@xcite",
    ", further modifications can be made by taking into account the influence of the state of the surrounding atoms on that of a single atom , i.e. , the ` crowding effect ' .",
    "the modifications involve the considerations of the jamming of a running block of atoms ( i.e. , a compact group of nearest neighboring atoms in the running state ) by an immobile block of atoms ( i.e. , a compact group of atoms in the immobile state ) .",
    "if these two adjacent blocks of atoms are sandwiched between two empty sites at the two ends , the state of _ all _ the atoms will then follow that of the larger block .",
    "this rule will be referred to as the majority rule . furthermore , since the spontaneous transition of atoms in the running state to the immobile state should be suppressed by an increasingly stronger forward bias , the parameter @xmath8 should be @xmath3-dependent .",
    "we impose the relation @xcite @xmath47 on the parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath48 is a model parameter .",
    "hence , the updating rules for model c can be state explicitly as below :    _ rule c1 _ : at a certain time step , if the ( @xmath49)th site to the @xmath16th site are _ all _ occupied by running atoms and the ( @xmath17)th site to the ( @xmath50)th site are _ all _ occupied by immobile atoms together with the condition that the ( @xmath51)th site and the ( @xmath52)th site are empty , then in the case of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , _ all _ the @xmath11 atoms become running ( immobile ) . immediately after the changes , the states of the sites are then updated according to the rules of model b with @xmath55 .",
    "rule c1 together with model b define the ca model c. figure 4 shows typical results for the mobility @xmath21 as a function of @xmath3 for different values of @xmath7 with @xmath48 taking on a value close to @xmath56 .",
    "it is observed that the results look very similar to that of model a except for the presence of _ hysteresis _ , a characteristic feature of the fk model @xcite , for @xmath57 .",
    "the values of @xmath21 obtained by gradually increasing @xmath3 from @xmath58 to @xmath6 are generally smaller than those obtained by gradually decreasing @xmath3 from @xmath6 , and the difference between the mobilities for increasing and decreasing bias fields at a particular value of @xmath3 increases with @xmath3 as observed in the lg model in ref.@xcite .",
    "the ca models with parallel updating rules have the advantage that they can be treated analytically within the context of dynamical systems .",
    "the general idea is to establish the time evolution equations for the state on each site of the lattice .",
    "the equations , in general , involve spatial correlation functions . with suitable approximations typically involving proper decoupling of the correlations ,",
    "a closed set of dynamical equations can be obtained .",
    "such a set of equations can be treated as a dynamical mapping between quantities at time @xmath14 and those at time @xmath15 . hence , following standard approaches in dynamical systems , the solution in the long time limit can be found by studying the fixed points ( attractors ) of the set of equations .",
    "such an approach has been successfully developed for traffic flow models @xcite in which the cars , which is analogous to the atoms in the present models , can only move in one direction without backward diffusion movements .",
    "to illustrate the idea , we apply the approach to study the modified ca models .",
    "it turns out that for models a and b , reasonably good agreement with numerical simulations can be obtained by retaining spatial correlations involving two neighbouring sites only .",
    "application of the method to model c is difficult due to the built - in long spatial correlations in the majority rule of the model , and hence results are only reported for models a and b.      although one can treat model b directly and obtain results of model a by setting @xmath41 , it is , however , illustrative to treat the simpler model a first .",
    "we denote the states of the @xmath16th site at time @xmath15 by the following set of boolean variables : @xmath59 obviously , these variables satisfy the relationships @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . here",

    "similarly , in order to represent whether an advancing or an immobile atom can hop into the empty site sandwiched between the two atoms at a certain time step , another boolean variable @xmath79 defined exactly the same as @xmath70 is introduced with @xmath80 . with this ,",

    "we study the time evolution of the variables @xmath66 and @xmath82 , i.e. , we seek the variables @xmath83 and @xmath84 as a function of quantities at time @xmath15 .",
    "focusing on @xmath83 , there are various ways in which the situation at time @xmath15 affects @xmath83 . from the rules a1 and a2 , a running or an advancing immobile atom occupying the ( @xmath19)th site at time @xmath15 will hop into the empty @xmath16th site if the ( @xmath17)th site is not occupied by a retreating immobile atom . at the next time step , the ( @xmath19)th site will become empty while the @xmath16th site will be occupied by a running atom .",

    "in this situation , the running atom will stay on the @xmath16th site at the next time step .",

    "a fourth contribution comes from the situation that a running atom at the @xmath16th site is blocked by another running atom at the ( @xmath17)th site and it gives a term @xmath89 to @xmath83 according to the rule a2 .",
