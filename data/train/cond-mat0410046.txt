    "since its discovery by kageyama _ et al_.@xcite , the spin dimer compound srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 has attracted much attention as a suitable material for frustrated spin systems in low dimension .",
    "srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 exhibits various interesting phenomena , such as a quantum disordered ground state  @xcite and a complex shape of magnetization curve@xcite , because of its unique crystal structure . in consideration of the structure , miyahara and",
    "ueda suggested that the magnetic properties of the spin dimer compound srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 can be described as a spin-@xmath6 two - dimensional ( 2d ) orthogonal - dimer model  @xcite , equivalent to the shastry - sutherland model on square lattice with some diagonal bonds  @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the shastry - sutherland model in dimer phase is exactly represented by a direct product of singlets .",
    "the low - energy dispersions possess six - fold degeneracy and are almost flat reflecting that the triplet tends to localize on vertical or horizontal bonds .",
    "recent experiments by esr  @xcite and neutron inelastic scattering  ( nis ) have observed splitting of degenerate dispersions of srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 , which can not be explained by the _ isotropic _",
    "shastry - sutherland model .",
    "hence c ' epas _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out that the dzyaloshinski - moriya  ( dm ) interaction  @xcite must be added between vertical and horizontal dimers in the isotropic shastry - sutherland model in order to explain the splitting .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , as a simple model to clarify effects of the dm interaction to low - energy excitations in orthogonal - dimer systems , one - dimensional ( 1d ) orthogonal - dimer model with the dm interaction is studied by using the perturbation theory and the numerical exact - diagonalization method . in the absence of the dm interactions , properties of ground state , low - energy excitations , and magnetization processes of the 1d orthogonal dimer model",
    "has been studied by several authors .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 1d orthogonal - dimer model with the dm interaction is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the number of unit cells in the system , as shown by a broken rectangle in fig .",
    "the unit cell includes two dimers along vertical and horizontal direction , which are designated by the index , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) denotes a spin-@xmath6 operator on @xmath15-spin in @xmath10-th dimer . @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath17 severally indicate the exchange coupling in intra - dimer and in inter - dimer . due to the structure of system ,",
    "the dm exchange interaction , @xmath18 , exists only on inter - dimer bonds and has only a component perpendicular to two kinds of dimer in the unit cell .",
    "the periodic boundary condition is imposed to the system .    , that is @xmath19 .",
    "the unit cell includes a vertical and horizontal dimer .",
    "the former dimers are at @xmath10-site and the latter at @xmath20-site.,width=283 ]",
    "in this section , let us discuss the ground state and low - energy excitations of the 1d orthogonal dimer model with the dm interaction .",
    "we can expect that the ground state is in the dimer phase in the limit of strong intra - dimer coupling ( @xmath21 ) , even when the dm interaction is switched on the isotropic system .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to treat the intra - dimer hamiltonian  ( [ eq : intra ] ) as an unperturbated one and the others as perturbation .",
    "the inter - dimer interaction @xmath17 creates two adjacent triplets from a pair of a singlet and triplet and vice versa , and besides shows scatterings between two triplets .",
    "the dm interaction not only causes the former process but also creates or annihilates two adjacent singlets . therefore the dm interaction can play a crucial role in the ground state and the low - energy excitations in the dimer phase .",
    "first , we discuss the ground - state energy of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . in the absence of the dm interaction , the ground state",
    "is exactly represented by a direct product of singlets and its energy is given as @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hands , the ground - state energy of total hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is estimated as @xmath23 from the perturbation expansion up to the third order in @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the result means that the ground state can not be exactly described by the direct product of singlets owing to the dm interaction .",
    "next , we argue the low - energy excitations in the system .",
    "since the ground state belongs to the dimer phase in the region of strong-@xmath16 , the lowest excited states will be well described by @xmath26 here , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the total magnetization and the wave number , respectivery . @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath30 in ket severally denote a singlet and a triplet with @xmath31 at @xmath10-site and , @xmath32  ( @xmath33 ) is defined as an operator to create a triplet propagating on vertical  ( horizontal ) dimers . by using two states of eqs .",

    "( [ eq : hm ] ) for @xmath1 has no off - diagonal elements within perturbation up to the third order .",
    "therefore the excitation energies for @xmath1 are given by @xmath37 in contrast to the 2d orthogonal dimer model , two excitation energies , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , split in the case of 1d system .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the curvature of @xmath39 appears in the third ordered correction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : excitede1 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the projected hamiltonian with @xmath40 has an off - diagonal element .",

    "( [ eq : apm1 ] ) , the excitation energies with @xmath40 are obtained as @xmath43 the curvature of @xmath44 is dominant by the first ordered correction with regard to @xmath25 in the off - diagonal element @xmath45 .",
    "the correction derives from the scattering between a singlet and a triplet with @xmath2 due to the dm interaction .    subtracting the ground - state energy of eq .",

    "the low energy spectra @xmath50 and @xmath51 are severally represented by the lower and upper solid lines , and then the upper and lower dotted lines denote @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omega2 ] ) .",
    "the full and open circles represent the low - energy spectra with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the perturbation theory is in agreement with the numerical diagonalization , as to low - energy excitations .",
    "the dispersions with same @xmath31 are not degenerate , which happens even if the dm interaction is not taken account of .",
    "therefore the inter - dime coupling @xmath17 is also important for splitting of the low - energy dispersions with same @xmath31 .",
    "this is because the parity on the vertical dimer is conserved in the one - dimension system without the dm interaction .",
    "the dm interaction not only splits into branches with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but also makes triplets move more easily .     and @xmath49 .",
    "the solid and dotted curves are of @xmath1 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the full  ( open ) circles indicates the excitation energies for @xmath1  ( @xmath2 ) calculated by numerical diagonalizations.,width=264 ]",
    "we investigated the low - energy excitations in the 1d orthogonal - dimer model with the dm interaction using the perturbation theory and numerical exact - diagonalization method .",
    "the dm interaction allows a triplet to propagate in singlet sea as seen in the 2d system  @xcite , while the triplet is localized on vertical or horizontal dimer in the absence of the dm interaction .",
    "this curvature effect happens in a two - dimensional orthogonal - dimer model , but the splitting of spectra reflects a stringent constraint for the motion of a triplet due to one dimensionality as well as the dm interaction .",
