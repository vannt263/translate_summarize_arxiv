    "the dominant galaxies in the local group , the milky way and andromeda ( m31 ) , are likely to collide in the next 510 gyr @xcite . in the meantime , however , we would like to know the proper ( transverse ) motion of m31 with respect to the milky way .",
    "@xcite show that measurements of the transverse motions of local group galaxies will critically test the fundamental assumption that luminosities trace the mass of galaxies .",
    "the proper motion of m31 is key to our understanding of the local group s future ( and past ) dynamical evolution as well as the density profiles and distribution of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that gaia , sim , or the square kilometer array will provide the @xmath11020  @xmath0as  yr@xmath2 astrometry required for a proper motion determination of m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but galactic analog masers in m31 observed with sensitive very long baseline interferometers ( vlbi ) over a time baseline of a few years would be adequate .",
    "indeed , 22  ghz water ( h@xmath4o ) masers have been discovered in m31 s satellite galaxies m33 @xcite and ic  10 @xcite , and @xcite have measured their proper motions , yielding their 3-dimensional velocities with respect to the milky way .",
    "@xcite also measured the proper rotation of m33 , which provides a geometric determination of its distance via `` rotational parallax . ''",
    "loeb  ( 2005 ) show that a backwards - time - evolution model has m33 colliding with m31 in the past .",
    "since m33 does not bear the morphological signatures of such an interaction ( but does show star formation possibly triggered by a close pass ) , one must assume that m31 was elsewhere at the time and thus has a non - negligible tangential motion , of order 100  km  s@xmath2   ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite )",
    ". detecting masers in m31 has historically been problematic @xcite . @xcite and @xcite conducted pointed h@xmath4o maser surveys toward regions in m31 , reaching 1@xmath5 rms noise levels of 29 and 70  mjy , respectively .",
    "claussen & beasley ( private communication ) conducted a survey for h@xmath4o masers in the nuclear region and across most of the molecular ring with the very large array , making no detections and reaching an rms noise of 30 mjy per beam . @xcite",
    "have detected the first maser of any type in m31 , a class ii methanol ( ch@xmath6oh ) maser at 6.7  ghz , but no associated water masers were detected .",
    "the water maser non - detections to date are all consistent with the aggregate star formation rate of m31 , and these surveys were not sufficiently sensitive to have detected a typical galactic maser at the distance of m31 @xcite .",
    "the lack of galactic analog water maser detections in m31 has simply been a problem of sensitivity and of locating likely sites of maser activity , both of which now have remedies .",
    "galactic analog h@xmath4o masers associated with star formation are detectable in m31 in reasonable integration time using the green bank telescope ( gbt ) ; they already have been detected in significantly more distant galaxies ( darling , brogan , & johnson 2008 ) .",
    "but a full survey of the star - forming regions of m31 with the sensitivity to detect galactic analog water masers is prohibitive because the galaxy is so large on the sky .",
    "we thus combined an order of magnitude sensitivity improvement compared to the best previous survey with a physically motivated pointing guide to the most likely sites of water maser activity . in this letter",
    ", we describe the source selection , the observations and data reduction , and the newly discovered water masers .",
    "we also discuss the prospects for using these masers for proper motion studies of m31 .    throughout this letter",
    ", we use heliocentric velocities ( optical definition ) and assume the following about m31 : a systemic velocity of @xmath7  km  s@xmath2  @xcite , a distance of 780  kpc @xcite , a major axis position angle of @xmath8 ( e of n ) , a constant inclination of @xmath9 , and a central coordinates 00:42:44.3 , + 41:16:09 ( j2000 ) .",
    "a spitzer 24  @xmath0 m map of m31 @xcite guided the gbt observations in two important ways : source selection and completeness .",
    "the association of water masers with ( ultra)compact regions is well known , but the molecular gas as traced by co emission does not necessarily indicate these regions . likewise , h@xmath10-selected regions may select _ against _ dust - enshrouded ultra - compact regions .",
    "compact 24  @xmath0 m emission , however , is a good indicator of likely h@xmath4o masers , and the rough relationship between far - ir emission and water maser luminosity is well - known ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we therefore selected compact ( unresolved at the 23.5  pc resolution of the spitzer map ) 24  @xmath0 m sources associated with the dusty molecular  and presumably star - forming  regions in m31 .",
    "we constructed a catalog of 206 of these objects working from the brightest down to the point where most of the 24  @xmath0 m emission becomes extended , about 4  mjy  steradian@xmath2 at peak specific intensity .",
    "although this pointed survey does not include all star formation in m31 , it does include a large fraction of the likely sites for strong h@xmath4o maser activity , and by working down in luminosity through the catalog of compact 24  @xmath0 m sources , we have surveyed a large fraction of the total ongoing star formation in the galaxy ( e.g. , tabatabaei & berkhuijsen 2010 ) and thus most of the likely h@xmath4o - bearing regions (  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : m31map ] shows the 24  @xmath0 m map of m31 with the pointing centers and primary beam size for our gbt water maser survey .",

    "the gbt survey has produced some surprises : ( 1 ) the strongest water maser complex lies outside of the main star - forming molecular ring in m31 , and ( 2 ) while the 24  @xmath0 m  selection method is a success , the 24  @xmath0 m  luminosity is not predictive of maser presence or strength .",
    "our survey has revealed no correlation between 24  @xmath0 m  luminosity and water maser luminosity , suggesting that while water masers arise in star - forming regions , the nonlinear amplification pathways and beamed nature of the water masers means that they are not predictable based on ir luminosity alone .",
    "we therefore believe that additional strong water masers may be found in m31 because our survey of 24  @xmath0m - emitting regions has not been exhaustive  it has simply selected the most ir - luminous compact sources ( figure [ fig : m31map ] ) .",
    "it is also certain that not all of the selected 24  @xmath0 m  sources are associated compact regions : cool stellar atmospheres , supernova remnants , planetary nebulae , and background agn and galaxies can all be sources of 24  @xmath0 m  emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "our detection statistics among the observed sample are thus not physically meaningful , although the majority of the 24  @xmath0 m  emitters in the molecular ring of m31 are likely to be compact regions .",

    "there are 23 h@xmath4o masers in the palagi  ( 1993 ) sample and about 30 masers in the @xcite sample that our survey could detect at the distance of m31 .",
    "hence , sensitivity is not the only consideration ; the number of water masers detectable in m31 will also depend on the the substantially lower star formation rate of m31 compared to galactic . to estimate the number of expected water masers in local group galaxies",
    ", @xcite used the @xcite galactic water maser luminosity function ( lf ) scaled from the galactic star formation rate to that of local group galaxies , assuming that maser population is proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "local group water maser statistics agree fairly well with this approach @xcite .",
    "we scale the galactic star formation rate ( @xmath14  @xmath16  yr@xmath2 ; diehl  2006 ) to that of m31 ( @xmath10.35  @xmath16  yr@xmath2 ; walterbos & braun 1994 , tabatabaei & berkhuijsen 2010 ) to predict 2.3 water masers for an isotropic line luminosity limit of @xmath17  @xmath18 , which is a 3@xmath5 line flux limit of 9  mjy and width 3.3  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this small number suffers from small number statistics , but our five detections suggest that either we have detected the majority of bright water masers in m31 or that the star formation scaling approach is inaccurate .",
    "this program is the first to detect the tail of the h@xmath4o maser lf in m31 .",
    "a comparison of the maser velocities to the rotation of m31 is of special interest for a geometric distance determination .",
    "proper rotation is a measure of angular frequency , and if this angular motion corresponds directly to the rotation velocity , then a geometric distance may be obtained : @xmath19 .",
    "a proper rotation distance determination relies on the the masers rotating with the galaxy , but they could also exhibit their own peculiar proper motions , so a large ensemble of water masers would be ideal to reduce this source of error .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rc ] we examine the correspondence between the maser velocities and the projected and inclined rotation curve @xcite . since the maser velocities are extremely well - determined ( sub - km  s@xmath2 ) , all of the uncertainty in the velocity comparison arises from the innate velocity dispersion of the disk , the statistical uncertainty in the rotation curve ( @xmath110  km  s@xmath2 ) , and the systematic uncertainties such as inclination , which can induce a rotation curve offset of order 1015  km  s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "while the masers show fairly good agreement with the rotation , there is a notable overall blueshift that may be indicative of preferentially oriented maser amplification pathways associated with outflows . but given the propensity for masers to show peculiar velocities , a larger sample is needed to rigorously examine this effect .",
    "the three main contributions to the proper motion of masers in m31 are ( 1 ) the rotation of the spiral disk , ( 2 ) the systemic proper motion of m31 itself , and ( 3 ) the relative motion of masers omitting the galaxy s rotation :    \\(1 ) the direct observation of the rotation of the m31 spiral disk is the ( in)famous van maanen experiment @xcite . a rotating disk seen edge - on will show no proper motion at the tangent points and the full circular velocity along the minor axis .",
    "m31 s inclined disk has a circular velocity at the molecular ring radius of about 250  km  s@xmath2 , which becomes a transverse motion of 56  km  s@xmath2 at the tangent points or 15 microarcseconds ( @xmath0as ) year@xmath2 . the transverse motion along the minor axis is expected to be about 70  @xmath0as yr@xmath2 . since the rotation curve of m31 is well - known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the measurement of the proper motions of masers distributed around the disk will provide a geometric distance to the galaxy , limited roughly equally by the uncertainty in the rotation model and in the proper motion measurements .",
    "\\(2 ) the transverse motion of m31 provides the two unknown components of its three - dimensional velocity .",
    "the expected transverse velocity of m31 is of order 100  km  s@xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see van der marel & guhathakurta 2008 ) , or 27  @xmath0as yr@xmath2 , and measurable over two or three years ( see below ) .",
    "( 3 ) there may be relative motions of masers within m31 due to peculiar deviations from the bulk rotation of the disk and due to the line of sight motion of m31 itself .",
    "the former peculiar motions are of order 1020  km  s@xmath2  ( figure [ fig : rc ] ) , which is significantly smaller than the velocities discussed above and of the same order as the uncertainty in the rotation curve",
    ". these will tend to average out over an ensemble of maser complexes .",
    "the latter is the moving cluster effect caused by m31 s radial velocity toward the galaxy ; m31 gets areally larger as it nears , causing relative maser separations to grow over time .",
    "this effect is small , about 3  @xmath0as yr@xmath2  of divergence for the maser pair with the largest separation , 1.79@xmath20 .",
    "the size of this effect is equivalent to @xmath110  km  s@xmath2 , similar to maser peculiar motions .",
    "it is possible that with long time baselines and a rich network of masers one could extract the distinct signal of diverging maser spots and thus estimate the distance to m31 ( but with lower precision than the proper rotation method ) .",
    "how long will it take to obtain proper motions , and what are the limits on the proper motions that can be measured ?",
    "the @xcite study of the proper motion of water masers in m33 informs our expectations for m31 .",
    "water masers appear in many - component complexes that can show dramatic variability , including the appearance of new masers and the disappearance of others .",
    "but over the span of about three years , @xcite were able to track several persistent maser features and obtain proper motions relative to background compact radio sources .",
    "their astrometric uncertainties were on average 810  @xmath0as in each epoch .",
    "proper motion uncertainties from a three - year fit were @xmath15  @xmath0as yr@xmath2 , which would correspond to a transverse velocity of 18  km  s@xmath2 in m31 .",
    "we estimate that in two 12-hour observations with the high sensitivity array one can obtain 1  mjy rms noise in 1  km  s@xmath2 channels .",
    "this translates into a 6  @xmath0as uncertainty _ per epoch _ for a 40  mjy line . in a single year",
    "we expect a 10@xmath5 detection of the proper rotation along the minor axis , a 2.5@xmath5 detection along the major axis , and a 4.5@xmath5 detection of the systemic transverse proper motion of m31 ( assuming 100  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "note that proper motion measurement errors improve as @xmath21 @xcite , so a 23 year astrometry campaign should be able to determine with high significance both the geometric distance to m31 and its transverse velocity .",
    "we have identified the first h@xmath4o masers in the m31 based on pointed observations of 24  @xmath0m - selected regions .",
    "the 24  @xmath0 m selection method clearly succeeds in identifying water masers , but the 24  @xmath0 m properties are not predictive of maser presence or brightness .",
    "we suggest that the catalog of water masers in m31 is incomplete and that an exhaustive survey of ir - luminous regions will identify additional masers .",
    "the newly identified maser complexes are suitable for proper motion studies of m31 .",
    "the next steps for proper motion and geometric distance measurements are interferometric localization and mapping followed by vlbi mapping and monitoring .",
