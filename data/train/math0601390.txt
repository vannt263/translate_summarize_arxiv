    "chern - simons invariants of links and three - manifolds have been a rich arena for the interactions of mathematics and physics in the last years .",
    "more recently , there has been a growing connection between chern - simons invariants and topological string theory / gromov - witten theory .",
    "this has motivated various developments and results .",
    "one of these developments has been the representation of chern - simons invariants of three - manifolds in terms of matrix integrals over a lie algebra @xcite .",
    "this representation has its origin in the work of rozansky on the trivial connection contribution to the chern - simons invariant @xcite , and on the results of lawrence and rozansky on the @xmath2 chern - simons invariant of seifert homology spheres @xcite .    in this short note",
    "we clarify these results in the light of the lmo invariant @xcite and its aarhus integral representation @xcite . after reviewing in section 2 the connection between chern ",
    "simons theory and matrix integrals , we show in section 3 that the lmo invariant of a rational homology sphere @xmath1 , evaluated for the @xmath0 weight system , can be always represented as a matrix integral .",
    "if the manifold @xmath1 is obtained through surgery on a link @xmath3 in @xmath4 , the matrix model ` potential ' involved in the matrix integral is related to the kontsevich integral of @xmath3 .",
    "since the lmo invariant is conjectured to capture the trivial connection contribution to the chern - simons invariant of @xmath1 , this suggests that this contribution always has a matrix integral representation , as shown in @xcite .",
    "m.m . would like to thank d. bar - natan and n. wyllard for discussions .",
    "the witten - reshetikhin - turaev ( wrt ) invariant of a three - manifold @xmath1 was originally defined by witten in @xcite as the partition function of a certain topological quantum field theory on @xmath1 , the so - called chern - simons theory .",
    "fortunately , the invariant can be defined in a purely combinatorial way , as we now describe .",
    "the wrt invariant depends on a choice of gauge group @xmath5 and of an integer @xmath6 related to the level of the affine lie algebra based on @xmath5 .",
    "we will use the following notations : @xmath7 denotes the rank of @xmath5 , and @xmath8 its dimension .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the dual coxeter number .",
    "the fundamental weights will be denoted by @xmath10 , and the simple roots by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 denotes as usual the weyl vector , given by the sum of the fundamental weights .",
    "the weight and root lattices of @xmath5 are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "finally , we put @xmath16 .",
    "the wrt invariant can be defined in terms of a surgery presentation of @xmath1 . by theorem due to lickorish ,",
    "any three - manifold @xmath1 can be obtained by surgery on a link @xmath3 in @xmath4 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the components of @xmath3 .",
    "the surgery operation means that around each of the knots @xmath17 we take a tubular neighborhood @xmath19 that we remove from @xmath4 .",
    "this tubular neighborhood is a solid torus with a contractible cycle @xmath11 and a noncontractible cycle @xmath20 .",
    "we then glue the solid torus back after performing an @xmath21 transformation given by the matrix @xmath22 this means that the cycles @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the boundary of the complement of @xmath25 are identified with the cycles @xmath11 , @xmath20 in @xmath26 .    to define the wrt invariant we use the representation of @xmath27 in the space of integrable representations of the affine lie algebra associated to @xmath5 .",
    "a representation given by a highest weight @xmath28 is integrable if the weight @xmath29 is in the fundamental chamber @xmath30 the fundamental chamber is given by @xmath31 modded out by the action of the weyl group . in the following ,",
    "the basis of integrable representations will be labeled by the weights in @xmath30 . in the case of simply - laced gauge groups ,",
    "the @xmath32 transformation given by @xmath33 has the following matrix elements in the above basis @xcite : @xmath34^{|\\delta_+| } \\over ( l |q|)^{r/2 } } \\exp \\bigl [ - { i d \\pi \\over 12 }   \\phi ( u^{(p , q)})\\bigr ] \\biggl ( { { \\rm vol}\\ , \\lambda_{\\rm w } \\over { \\rm vol}\\ ,   \\lambda_{\\rm r } } \\biggr)^{1 \\over 2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdot & \\sum_{n \\in \\lambda_{\\rm r}/q \\lambda_{\\rm r}}\\sum_{w \\in { \\mathcal w } } \\epsilon ( w ) \\exp \\bigl\\ { { i \\pi \\over l q } ( p \\alpha^2 - 2\\alpha ( l n + w(\\beta ) ) + s(ln + w(\\beta))^2 \\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath35 denotes the number of positive roots of @xmath5 , and the second sum is over the weyl group @xmath36 of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath37 is the rademacher function : @xmath38= { p + s \\over q } - 12 s(p , q),\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the dedekind sum @xmath40 in terms of the above data , the wrt invariant of @xmath1 is given by : @xmath41 in this equation , @xmath42 is the quantum group invariant of the link @xmath3 with representation @xmath43 attached to its @xmath44-th component ( recall that the weights in @xmath30 are of the form @xmath29 ) .",
    "the phase factor @xmath45 is a framing correction that guarantees that the resulting invariant is in the canonical framing for the three - manifold @xmath1 .",
    "its explicit expression is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the signature of the linking matrix of @xmath48 .",
    "one can show that the above definition of wrt is invariant under kirby moves , therefore it defines a topological invariant of the three - manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the wrt invariant was originally defined by witten in quantum - field theoretic terms , as the partition function of chern - simons theory on the three - manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the action of chern - simons theory is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a @xmath5-connection on @xmath1 , and the wrt invariant is given by @xmath51 the description given above in terms of combinatorial data can be derived from chern - simons theory in the context of canonical quantization .",
    "the fact that the wrt invariant is the partition function of a quantum field theory suggests that it can be evaluated semiclassically as a sum over critical points of the action . in the case of the chern - simons functional ( [ csaction ] ) , the critical points are flat connections on @xmath1 .",
    "each term in the sum is in turn an asymptotic , perturbative expansion around the flat connection in powers of the coupling constant of the model .",
    "moreover , it can be argued that the terms in this perturbative expansion contain important topological information about the three - manifold @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the one - loop contribution involves the analytic torsion of the flat connection @xcite , while the two - loop contribution around the trivial flat connection turns out to be equal to the casson - walker invariant of @xmath1 @xcite .    from the point of view of combinatorial definition of the wrt invariant ,",
    "the properties that emerge in the asymptotic expansion in powers of the coupling constant are far from being obvious . in the case of seifert spaces",
    ", it was shown in @xcite that the wrt invariant for gauge group @xmath2 can be written as a sum of contour integrals and residues which correspond to the contributions associated to the different flat connections .",
    "some of the results of @xcite were generalized in @xcite to general simply - laced groups , where it was shown that the contribution of reducible flat connections can be written as a matrix integral . in @xcite ,",
    "beasley and witten have presented a very elegant derivation of this matrix integral representation in the case of the trivial flat connection , by using non - abelian localization .",
    "a similar result has been recently obtained in @xcite .",
    "seifert homology spheres can be constructed by performing surgery on a link @xmath3 in @xmath4 with @xmath52 components , consisting on @xmath53 parallel and unlinked unknots together with a single unknot whose linking number with each of the other @xmath53 unknots is one .",
    "the surgery data are @xmath54 for the unlinked unknots , @xmath55 , and 0 on the final component .",
    "@xmath56 is coprime to @xmath57 for all @xmath55 , and the @xmath56 s are pairwise coprime . after doing surgery",
    ", one obtains the seifert space @xmath58 .",
    "this is rational homology sphere whose first homology group @xmath59 has order @xmath60 , where @xmath61 we will denote @xmath62 . for @xmath63 , seifert homology spheres reduce to lens spaces , and",
    "one has that @xmath64 . for @xmath65",
    ", we obtain the brieskorn homology spheres @xmath66 ( in this case the manifold is independent of @xmath67 ) . by using the formulae for the wrt invariant presented above ,",
    "one can write the contribution of reducible flat connections to the chern - simons partition function of @xmath68 as @xmath69^{|\\delta_+| } \\over |p|^{r/2 } } { \\rm e}^ { { \\pi i d \\over 4 } { \\rm sign}(h / p ) + { \\pi",

    "and we have introduced @xmath73 the lattice @xmath74 decomposes in different weyl orbits , and each of these orbits correspond to a different , reducible flat connection .",
    "the contribution of the trivial flat connection is obtained by setting @xmath75 in ( [ fians ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will show that the lmo invariant of a rational homology sphere , evaluated through the @xmath0 weight system , can be always expressed as a matrix integral .",
    "this follows very simply by the definition of the lmo invariant in terms of formal gaussian integration given in @xcite , and the detailed structure of the @xmath0 weight system .",
    "since the lmo invariant is conjectured to capture the contribution of the trivial connection to the wrt invariant , our result indicates that this contribution is expected to have a representation in terms of matrix integrals , as it happens with the seifert homology spheres .",
    "in particular , we will show that the result ( [ fians ] ) for seifert spheres agrees with the @xmath0 evaluation of the lmo invariant calculated in @xcite .",
    "the physics origin of the kontsevich integral of a link in @xmath4 is chern - simons perturbation theory along the trivial flat connection of the backround 3-space .",
    "the feynmann diagrams of the theory are trivalent graphs with legs ( so - called unitrivalent graphs ) . the legs are colored by the components of the link , and the edges along the trivalent vertices are equipped with a cyclic ordering .",
    "the graphs are considered modulo the as and ihx relations .",
    "the graphs can be multiplied ( using the disjoint union ) and can be graded ( where the degree of a graph is half the number of vertices ) . using formal linear combinations ( with coefficients in @xmath76 ) of these graphs , we can define a completed graded algebra @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a set in 1 - 1 correspondence with the components of the link .",
    "it turns out that the konstevich integral of a link is a group - like element of @xmath77 , thus we can define its logarithm @xmath79 which lies in the completed vector space @xmath80 generated by _ connected _ unitrivalent graphs , modulo the as and ihx relations .                for every nonnegative natural number @xmath89",
    ", there is an lmo integration map @xmath90 which takes values in @xmath91 , the vassiliev degree @xmath92 part of the completed vector space @xmath93 of trivalent graphs with vertex orientations modulo the as and ihx relations . if the integrand @xmath94 is group - like , then the sequence @xmath95 can be assembled in a group - like element in @xmath93 , which we denote by @xmath96 .",
    "this allows us to define @xmath97 as well as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the unknot with framing @xmath100 and @xmath101 is the number of positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) eigenvalues of the linking matrix of @xmath87 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath102 is depends only on @xmath1 and not on the framed link @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , @xmath102 is group - like , that is we can define its logarithm : @xmath103 which takes values in @xmath104 .      *",
