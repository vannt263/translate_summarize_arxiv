    "several new spin gap systems have been found experimentally . among them",

    "recently a new two dimensional spin gap system srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 has been found by kageyama _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it has a spin - singlet ground state with a finite spin gap @xmath11 k. they also found that the peak of the susceptibility is much suppressed compared with standard dimer models , and observed two plateaus in the magnetization at 1/4 and 1/8 of the full moment .",
    "miyahara and ueda@xcite showed that these observations could be understood on the basis of a simple two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet model with nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor couplings .",
    "the copper ions in the srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 compound are all located at crystallographically equivalent sites , forming a distinctive pattern .",
    "miyahara and ueda@xcite show that , remarkably enough , a singlet dimer state forms an exact eigenstate of this hamiltonian at all couplings , and is the ground - state in a region where the nearest - neighbour coupling dominates .",
    "there is a first order phase transition to a nel ordered state at @xmath12 .",
    "they find that the srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 system lies close to this transition , which explains the unusual temperature dependence of the magnetization .",
    "the plateaus observed in the magnetization curve can also be understood , on the basis that the triplet excitations from the ground state are almost localized .",
    "their conclusions were reached on the basis of exact diagonalization calculations for lattices of up to 20 sites , and low order dimer expansions in @xmath13 , and high temperature expansions in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    in this paper , we reinforce these conclusions by carrying out a more extensive series study of the model . these include high - temperature expansions , ising expansions at zero temperature , and dimer expansions both at zero and finite temperature .",
    "the model is presented in section ii , and the framework for the various series expansions is outlined .",
    "the results are presented in section iii .",
    "it is shown that the temperature dependence of the susceptibility can be fitted accurately and in detail by this method .",
    "the magnetic properties of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 may be described by the two - dimensional spin @xmath16 heisenberg antiferromagnetic model with nearest - neighbor ( n.n . ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( n.n.n . ) interactions@xcite : @xmath17 the system is illustrated in fig .",
    "we denote the ratio of the couplings as @xmath18 , that is , @xmath19 . in the present paper ,",
    "we study only the case of antiferromagnetic coupling , where both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are positive . in the large @xmath22 limit , the model is topologically equivalent to the two dimensional nearest - neighbor square lattice heisenberg model . in the small @xmath22 limit ,",
    "every pair of spins along nearest - neighbor bonds interact only weakly with each other , and the dominant configuration in the ground state is the product state with the spins along nearest - neighbor bonds forming a spin singlet .",
    "in fact , it has been proved@xcite that this state is an eigenstate of the system for any @xmath18 , and it is the ground state for small enough values of @xmath18 .",
    "we can also prove that this system still has this perfect dimer state as an eigenstate even if we include the coupling @xmath23 denoted by dotted lines shown in fig .",
    "we have studied this system by using various linked - cluster expansion methods including dimer expansions at both zero - temperature and finite - temperature , ising expansions at zero - temperature , and high temperature expansions .",
    "the linked - cluster expansion method has been previously reviewed in several articles@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "here we only summarize the expansion methods used , and the results derived from them are presented in the next section .      at temperature @xmath2 , we can construct an expansion in @xmath18 by taking the first term of @xmath24 as the unperturbed hamiltonian and the second term in @xmath24 as a perturbation .",
    "that is , the hamiltonian of eq.([h ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and where we have set @xmath27 for convenience .",
    "the unperturbed ground state is then a product state of nearest neighbor singlet dimers and the perturbation couples these among themselves and with the pair triplet states . as mentioned above ,",
    "the unperturbed ground state is also an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian , but is not the true ground state for @xmath28 .",
    "dimer expansions can be developed for all ground state properties as well as for the triplet excitation spectrum . here , because of the trivial nature of the ground state in the dimer phase , we concentrate on the lowest triplet excitations .",
    "we have calculated the dispersion relation @xmath29 to order @xmath30 , extending the calculation of miyahara and ueda by 11 terms .",

    "ising series have been calculated for the ground state energy per site , @xmath39 and the staggered magnetization @xmath40 , for several ratios of couplings @xmath18 and ( simultaneously ) for several values of @xmath41 up to order @xmath42 .",

    ", we first transform the series to a new variable @xmath46 to remove the singularity at @xmath45 predicted by the spin - wave theory .",
    "this was first proposed by huse@xcite and was also used in our earlier work on the square lattice case@xcite .",

    "the high temperature series expansions were first carried out by miyahara and ueda@xcite up to order @xmath61 .",
    "our results agree with these previous results , and extend the series by 5 terms .",
    "the study of finite temperature properties via series expansions is usually done by the high temperature expansion method as mentioned above , where we expand in powers of @xmath62 for given ratio of exchange couplings .",
    "this method often performs poorly at low temperatures for many parameter regimes of interest . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", one can develop the dimer expansion at finite temperature , where we expand the thermodynamic quantities in power of @xmath18 for arbitrary temperatures .",
    "this method has been used by one of us previously for the hubbard model @xcite and more recently also by elstner and singh@xcite for spin models .",
    "this method has shown excellent convergence for a wide range of coupling constants at all temperatures for the bilayer heisenberg model@xcite and for alternating spin - chains and spin ladders@xcite .    to get an expansion for thermodynamic quantities , such as the susceptibility and the specific heat , in @xmath18 at arbitrary temperature for the hamiltonian in eq.([hdimer ] ) , one basically needs to expand @xmath63 in powers of @xmath18 .",
    "this can be obtained by using the following relation @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the integrals given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 the integrations needed in this expansion are of the type : @xmath68 and can easily be integrated analytically .",

    "again , we can see that the results from a direct sum of the dimer expansion series at finite temperature converges well down to @xmath2 , ( it converges less well near the peak position ) , while the integrated differential approximants to the high - temperature expansion series only converge to the position of the peak .",
    "it is clear that the dimer expansion at finite temperature gives much better results than the high - temperature expansion for those values of the exchange coupling parameters which lie within the dimer phase .",

    "we note that the dimer expansion sums tend to show sharp peaks , which are not visible in either the experimental data or the high - temperature expansions .",
