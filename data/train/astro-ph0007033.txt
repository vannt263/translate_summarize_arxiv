    "why a survey for local qsos ? + because in the epoch of 2df and sdss , of the thousands of qsos at @xmath7 , it is important to have precise information about the spatial density and the clustering of nearby agn to provide zero - point and leverage for the study of the qso evolution . as in other fields , it is paradoxical that we know much better the properties of the high - z qso population than the local one .",
    "the technical problem is however not trivial since , as the pg survey ( schmidt & green 1983 ) made clear , it is necessary to cover the whole sky to obtain sufficient statistics where the present data are unsatisfactory : at @xmath8 and magnitudes around @xmath9 .",
    "such a task has become relatively simpler in recent times , thanks to the availability of large high - quality databases .",
    "what do we need ? + first of all , since our goal is the study of the optical luminosity function ( olf ) of qsos , we need a homogeneous database of optical fluxes covering the whole sky . of various existing possibilities : apmapmcat/ ] , roe / nrl , usno , gsc , dss , none turned out to be entirely satisfactory . after a careful analysis of their sensitivity , completeness , accuracy , we have chosen a combination of the catalogs gsc , usno and dss :    1 .   in the northern hemisphere objects from the gsc catalog with @xmath10 .",
    "the relation between the @xmath11 band and the corresponding johnson @xmath12 turned out to be : @xmath13 , with @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "seven ( @xmath16 ) of the 183 landolt stars used for this comparison were not found in the gsc catalog .",
    "2 .   in the northern hemisphere objects from the usno catalog with @xmath17 .",
    "the relation between the @xmath18 band and the corresponding johnson - kron - cousins @xmath19 turned out to be @xmath20 , with @xmath21 @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   in the southern hemisphere",
    "we have derived @xmath22 magnitudes from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "small scans ( `` postage stamps '' of @xmath23 ) of each object of interest and of 20 - 50 surrounding objects with known gsc @xmath22 magnitudes were extracted from the dss .",
    "the magnitude of the object of interest was then calibrated against the gsc objects . in this way",
    "a @xmath24 of @xmath25 @xmath15 was obtained in the interval @xmath26 .    -8 mm -5 mm",
    "the second step is to select among the millions of objects in the magnitude range of interest the few hundreds of qsos .",
    "we have used the rass bright source catalogue ( rass - bsc , voges et al .",
    "1999 ) to compute the x - optical color , @xmath27 which provides a key signature of the agn phenomenon .",
    "if we take from the vron & vron catalog ( 1998 ) all the non x - ray selected bright qsos with @xmath28 , assign to them the optical magnitudes of our databases and plot them vs. the corresponding rass fluxes , we obtain the diagram of fig .  1 .",
    "we can see that , if we select objects with @xmath29 , the incompleteness does not depend on the optical flux : we lose a fraction of about @xmath30 of the qsos , which can be accounted for , and we obtain a reasonably short list of candidates : 520 in the north over 8000 sq.deg . and 301 in the south over 5600 sq.deg",
    ".    conveniently , more than @xmath31 of the objects have already an identification in simbad or ned . for the remaining ones we are taking spectra with the telescopes at the asiago , la silla and kitt peak observatories .",
    "the success rate is around @xmath32 .",
    "we have observed @xmath33 of the candidates in the north , @xmath32 in the south , collecting a total of 290 qsos . at completion",
    "we expect to produce a sample of about 450 qsos .",
    "preliminary results have been reported in grazian et al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "the optical counts have been computed in the @xmath22 band , correcting our v and r magnitudes according to the average colors of the sample , and are shown in fig .",
    "they confirm the well known incompleteness of the pg survey ( about a factor 3 ) and agree with the extrapolation of other recent surveys to somewhat fainter magnitudes .",
    "the derived olf confirms and strengthens the claim of la franca & cristiani ( 1997 , lc97 ) , i.e. a significant departure of the evolution at low - z from the pattern generally described with a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) .",
    "it is debatable whether the best parameterization of the data is provided by a luminosity dependent luminosity evolution ( e.g. lc97 ) or by a slow - down of the evolutionary rate and/or a mild density evolution at low - z ( see vittorini & cavaliere , this conference ) . to obtain a more physical insight it is however advisable to put these results in the context of the models of formation and evolution of galactic structures , for evidence",
    "is mounting that the qso activity , the growth of super - massive black holes and the formation of spheroids are closely linked phenomena .",
    "on the one hand , the increased qso space density at low - z corresponds better to the predictions of semi - analytical models ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) , in which the recurrent activity of short - lived qsos is related to the merging of halos , the availability of gas for the accretion and its timescale .",
    "on the other hand , a weak density evolution and a smoother overall shape of the olf at low - z are natural predictions of the models of cavaliere & vittorini ( 2000 ) arguing that at @xmath34 efficient black hole fueling is triggered by the encounters of a gas - rich host with its companions in groups ."
