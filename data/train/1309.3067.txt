    "over the last few decades , the design and subsequent study of man - made nanostructures has occupied a crucial place in pure and applied condensed matter research .",
    "the importance of these systems stems from the fact that , on the one hand , they are excellent tools to probe the laws of physics at different length scales , and on the other hand , their technological applications are vast , spanning electronics , optical devices , and spintronics . quantum dots ( qds ) are a paradigmatic example that illustrates the general trend.@xcite qds mimic atoms at a larger length scale ( they are called sometimes artificial atoms ) and allow a flexible control of the  atomic \" properties , like the strength of the coulomb interaction via the dielectric constant , the number of electrons , the shape of the confining potential , the spin - orbit interaction , etc . quantum rings ( qrs ) @xcite are another important example of nanostructured systems where interesting physical effects can be explored ",
    "aharonov - bohm effect , persistent currents , quantum interference , etc .",
    "much research is being carried out on semiconductor nanostructures , which present , among other interesting features , a strong coupling with optical ( or near optical ) electromagnetic fields .",
    "naturally , the electronic states of these structures can be probed and manipulated using a variety of light pulses .",
    "for instance , the use of femtosecond light pulses is usually claimed to outperform other methods when an ultrafast control is sought .",
    "however , there has been very little exploration of what can be done on semiconductor nanostructures by taking advantage of the inhomogeneous nature of light beams . in particular , the interaction of these structures with twisted light ( tl)@xcite  i.e .",
    "light carrying orbital angular momentum ( oam)is only beginning to be studied .",
    "we have recently initiated studies in this direction , both for qds  @xcite and qrs .",
    "@xcite    in particular , our previous article in qds explored the interaction of disk - shaped qds with twisted - light , in the case where the beam axis coincides with the symmetry axis of the qd . we predicted that the transitions are not vertical and may connect states having different values of the orbital angular momentum of the electron , and from an applied standpoint , that the use of light carrying oam would facilitate the ultrafast manipulation of the electronic states in the system .",
    "this article extends our previous work on qds and qrs to the general case of the interaction of inhomogeneous fields  with special emphasis on tl beams  with qds or qrs when the symmetry axis of the nanostructure and the beam axis do not coincide .",
    "the problem we study is of interest , for it addresses realistic experimental situations , like the irradiation of an ensemble of nanostructures , where each nanostructure will see a displaced light beam .",
    "also , when a single nanostructure is meant to be addressed , our theory shows how an imprecise centering of the beam can alter significantly the optical transitions .",
    "finally , from a constructive point of view , our calculations display the wealth of opportunities for optical control of electronic states which can be achieved by simply changing the positioning , waist , and orbital angular momentum of the light beam .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : background ] briefly covers the already studied problem of the interaction of tl with electrons in nanostructures ( qds and qrs ) when the beam and system symmetry axes coincide .",
    "section [ sect : off - centered case ] develops the theory used to solve the general problem of a tl beam displaced from the symmetry axis of the nanostructure , and presents our main findings .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we treat the problem of the interaction of tl with qds and qrs , in the case where both symmetry axes coincide .",
    "the model and results are based on previous studies , and serve as an introduction to the more general problem of off - centered beams .",
    "succinctly stated , twisted light is light carrying orbital angular momentum @xmath0 , characterized by inhomogeneous fields having a phase @xmath1 and radial dependence of the laguerre or bessel form . in the coulomb gauge , the inhomogeneous vector potential has both transverse and longitudinal components . under typical experimental conditions ,",
    "the transverse component is the dominant one , and reads in cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the transverse circular - polarization vector .",
    "we choose to work with bessel modes for the radial dependence , since these will allow for analytical results in the next section .",
    "thus , we take @xmath4 quantum dots and rings based on semiconductor materials can be made to confine both electrons and holes .",
    "electronic states in these structures can be mathematically described by the product of envelope @xmath5 , microscopic @xmath6 ( here taken at zero crystal momentum ) , and spin @xmath7 functions @xmath8",

    "therefore , a two - band model in the effective - mass approximation with one conduction ( @xmath9 ) and one heavy - hole valence ( @xmath10 ) band is sufficient to treat our problem .",
    "in addition , we have assumed that the envelope function is separable .",
    "furthermore , since the confinement in the @xmath11-direction is much stronger than that in the x - y plane , it is a good approximation to assume that the electron remains in the lowest - energy @xmath11-eigenstate .",
    "the coupling between the semiconductor structure and the tl beam is modelled using the minimal - coupling hamiltonian , which to lowest order in the vector potential is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the charge and mass of the electron .",
    "this coupling causes electronic transitions between the conduction and valence bands .",
    "the physics of the interaction can be derived ",
    "e.g .  using fermi s golden rule , master equation , heisenberg equations  from the matrix elements of @xmath15 .",
    "since we are interested in interband transitions , the rotating - wave approximation is applied and we obtain for the matrix elements of the light - matter interaction @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a collective index that gathers all quantum numbers relevant for qds ( radial and angular ) or qrs ( angular ) .",
    "the expressions given above represent absorption ( @xmath18 ) and emission ( @xmath19 ) of light , respectively [ for a detailed derivation , see refs .",
    "( ) and ( ) ] .",
    "we now consider the case of light beams whose center is displaced with respect to that of the nanostructure .",
    "we formulate the theory for tl beams with arbitrary oam , given by @xmath20 ; the case of plane waves is then easily derived by setting @xmath21 . the geometry of the problem is shown in fig .  [ figure : scheme ] .",
    "the nanostructure is centered at the origin of coordinates , with symmetry axis along @xmath11 , and a beam of tl propagates in the @xmath11-direction , displaced from the origin by a distance @xmath22 .",
    "hereafter , we shall refer to this situation as having an `` off - centered '' tl beam ( with respect to the nanostructure ) .",
    "we first formulate the theory and then analyze the main aspects of its predictions .    ,",
    "and the tl beam axis passes through @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath11-axis is normal to the plane of the drawing . ]",
    "let us use eq .",

    "( [ eq : off - centereda ] ) , the final form of the vector potential centered at position @xmath23 is @xmath30 is given in terms of a superposition of tl vector potentials centered at the origin , each having different oam , and weighed by @xmath31 .",
    "this expansion is easily understood by analogy with the transformation of angular momentum in classical mechanics , when the proper axis  from which the motion is seen as a pure rotation ",
    "is changed to an arbitrary axis .",
    "although our transformation makes the representation of @xmath32 more complex , it is justified by the need to refer both the tl beam and the electronic states to the same axis .",
    "figure [ fig : cintas ] shows the weights squared @xmath33 of the decomposition of eq .",

    "then , @xmath41 the final expressions read    @xmath42    where , to ease the notation , we eliminated the delta functions for the spin indices , and assumed that the bands are the correct ones which yield non - vanishing matrix elements .",
    "we would like to draw first a general picture of what happens to the electronic transitions when the tl beam is displaced .",
    "to this end , let us consider the main ingredient in the calculation of the transition probability using fermi s golden rule , namely @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 contains relevant information , that will be unfolded later in this section , when precise numerical calculations are presented .    for concreteness ,",
    "let us assume that the tl beam possesses @xmath46 ; it is worth stressing that @xmath20 is the oam of the beam as seen from its proper axis . when the beam is centered , @xmath47 only for @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that the only allowed transition is that connecting states that differ by one unit of angular momentum : @xmath49 , see fig .",

    "is displaced off the nanostructure symmetry axis , other transitions between states having @xmath50 become allowed , see fig .",

    ", there are specific values of @xmath52 such that , for instance , the transition matrix element between states differing by one unit of angular momentum is zero , while the probability for other transitions remains finite , as illustrated in fig .",

    "@xmath53 a centered beam produces a non - vertical transition between a valence - band and a conduction - band state differing in one unit of angular momentum @xmath54 . @xmath55 an off - centered beam produces several non - vertical transitions .",
    "@xmath56 for a particular choice of @xmath52",
    "the transition from the upper valence - band state to the @xmath57 conduction - band state becomes negligible . ]    in order to perform a numerical analysis , we shall now consider the whole expressions in eqs .",

    "the matrix element for the absorption of light becomes @xmath70 we are now in a position to precisely determine the transition probability .",
    "we see at once that the probability for the transition @xmath71 is determined by the displacement @xmath23 , the difference @xmath72 between the angular momentum quantum numbers , and the relative sizes of qr ( @xmath59 ) to beam waist ( @xmath73 ) .    for a general displacement @xmath74 , several transition matrix elements have finite values , as explained before .",
    "the relative strength of each transition is determined by @xmath75 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "let us exemplify for a tl beam with @xmath46 ; then , we have @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : curves ] shows the quantity @xmath77 ^ 2 $ ] for different values of @xmath22 and @xmath72 .",
    "we observe what was said previously from a qualitative point of view . at zero displacement ,",
    "the only contribution comes from transitions differing by one unit in their angular momentum . when the beam is displaced , other transitions become allowed .",
    "an extinction occurs when the value @xmath78 is a zero of the bessel function .     and for different values of the initial and final angular momentum quantum number .",
    "]    another interesting situation arises when the beam carries no oam , i.e.  @xmath21 in eq .",

    "an important difference arises with respect to the @xmath81 case ; since the function @xmath82 ^ 2 $ ] is symmetric on @xmath72 , the transitions having @xmath83 have equal probability , and in most situations there will be no net transfer of orbital angular momentum .",
    "however , this symmetry can be broken by the application of a magnetic field , which detunes one of the possible final states .",
    "also , this symmetry is broken ( even without an applied magnetic field ) if the initial population of valence - band states is asymmetric with respect to the quantum number @xmath54 .",

    "( [ eq : me_hplus_qring ] ) , the various electronic transitions are enhanced and inhibited to some degree , and this results in a different evolution of the electronic states in each qr .",
    "we have theoretically investigated the effect that an inhomogeneous light beam , such as plane waves ( @xmath21 ) with a finite waist or twisted light beams ( @xmath85 ) , has on semiconductor - based nanostructures , when the symmetry axes of the beam and the nanoparticle do not coincide .",
    "the problem was analytically solved for the general case of twisted light with @xmath86 by writing the off - centered beam as a superposition of twisted light beams centered at the position of the nanoparticle .",
    "this decomposition allowed us to study the possible electronic transitions in terms of the problem of a centered beam illuminating a nanoparticle , which we have already investigated in a previous work .",
    "we showed that different transitions between states in the nanoparticle are switched on and off as a function of the distance from the beam to the nanoparticle axes .",
    "in addition , the strength of the transition is determined by the relative size of the nanostructure to the beam waist .",
    "our results also predict that a plane - wave beam with a finite waist will induce both vertical and non - vertical transitions depending on the displacement of the axes .",
    "our study indicates that , under several experimental conditions , care must be taken when interpreting the results of light - nanoparticle interaction .",
    "for example , if an ensemble of nanostructures is illuminated in normal incidence using a beam whose waist is roughly of the same size or smaller than the ensemble , each nanoparticle will respond in a different way , irrespective of the beam being a plane wave or twisted light . in a situation where the experiment is carried out on a single nanostructure , we saw that the precise positioning of the tl axis is crucial to know what transitions are being excited .",
