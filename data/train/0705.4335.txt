    "one can reach the low - tunneling regime where each site is an essentially isolated harmonic trap occupied by few fermions @xcite .",
    "this opens up a new window into the study of few - body systems with two - body scattering lengths @xmath0 that are large compared to the range @xmath1 of the interaction , @xmath2 .",
    "large-@xmath3 systems are of particular theoretical interest when particle momenta @xmath4 are small compared to @xmath5 , because then they exhibit universal behavior , that is , the system properties depend essentially only on @xmath0 ( and for bosons or multi - component fermions , also on a three - body parameter ) , but not on the details of the interaction .",

    "the two - nucleon ( @xmath12 ) system has two @xmath13-wave channels where @xmath2 : the scattering lengths are about @xmath14 fm and @xmath15 fm in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 channels , respectively , compared with a range of about @xmath18 fm .",

    "since we are interested in the long - range dynamics , we can approximate the complicated short - range physics as a series of contact interactions that are delta functions with an increasing number of derivatives .",
    "this can be formulated as a non - relativistic eft where observables are expressed in an expansion in powers of @xmath19 ( assuming , for simplicity , that the size of all scattering parameters except for the scattering length is set by @xmath1 ) .",

    "unfortunately , there is no _ a priori _ justification for the cluster approximation in the context of phenomenological interactions .",
    "we have recently proposed @xcite a combination of ncsm and eft in which the cluster approximation is seen as a consequence of the eft power counting . instead of performing a unitary transformation on phenomenological interactions",

    "here we consider a system of @xmath20 identical two - component fermions of mass @xmath25 , where the two - body scattering length @xmath0 is large compared to the range @xmath1 of the interaction , @xmath2 .",
    "this system is assumed to be trapped in a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath6 , whose length parameter is also sufficiently large , @xmath9 .",
    "we allow various values of the ratio @xmath26 ranging from the unitary limit @xmath27 to the untrapped case @xmath28 .",
    "( note that we use units such that @xmath29 . )    under these conditions , details of the inter - particle potential are irrelevant , and in leading order can be replaced by a non - derivative two - body contact interaction between different components . without loss of generality",
    "we can refer to the two components as spin-1/2 states , in which case the contact interaction acts only in the @xmath30 channel .",
    "we denote its interaction strength by @xmath31 .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian for trapped particles , @xmath32}\\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{r}_{i}-\\vec{r}_{j } ) , \\label{eq : ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the position and momentum , respectively , of particle @xmath35 , and @xmath36 $ ] denotes a pair of particles with opposite spin .",
    "this hamiltonian can be written as a sum of relative and center - of - mass ( cm ) motion , so that the energy of the system is the sum of internal ( @xmath37 ) and cm ( @xmath38 ) terms : @xmath39 the cm motion is that of a simple ho , so in the following we focus on the relative motion .    the internal hamiltonian is not well defined as it stands , since the delta function is singular .",
    "renormalization is necessary : after a truncation of the hilbert space with a cutoff in energy or momentum , @xmath31 is taken to depend on the cutoff in such a way that finite , cutoff - independent results are obtained for observables .",
    "the many - body problem can not in general be solved analytically , but renormalization can be incorporated easily in numerical calculations , which are formulated from the outset within a finite space .    these issues can be made explicit in the two - body system , where the relative motion of two particles of opposite spin is described by @xmath40 \\label{eq : rel2b}\\ ] ] in terms of the relative coordinate @xmath41 and the reduced mass @xmath42 .    in the conventional ncsm approach , one chooses the model space by truncating in the number of shells included in the calculation .",
    "more precisely , one considers only ho states with the principal quantum number @xmath43 smaller than a given value @xmath21 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is then constructed via a unitary transformation @xmath44 @xmath45 , designed so that the lowest @xmath46 eigenvalues of @xmath47 are exactly reproduced by @xmath48 ( @xmath46 is the dimension of the model space ) .",
    "of course , the transformed hamiltonian no longer has the form of the initial interaction , and , in particular , additional non - local terms are induced even if one starts with a contact interaction .    the alternative approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on principles of eft , and it constructs the interaction between particles making use of power counting .",
    "thus , in each model space one preserves the form of the interaction , as dictated by the power counting , and one determines the strength of each interaction strength as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath6 so that some observables are exactly reproduced .",
    "for example , one can fix @xmath49 such that the two - body ground - state energy is fixed .    in this paper",
    "we propose an intermediate approach .",
    "thus , as in ref .",
    "@xcite we consider only the terms dictated by power counting , but instead of adjusting their strength to reproduce observables in the few - body system , we reproduce the @xmath6-dependent energies of two - body states , as in the conventional ncsm approach .",
    "the number of states whose energies are to be reproduced is fixed by the number of coupling constants to be adjusted , and not by the dimension of the model space , as in the conventional approach involving a unitary transformation .",
    "we note that , according to the general principles of eft , even if initially we start with only a contact interaction , each truncation is going to induce additional correction terms .",
    "effectively , the truncation of the space induces effective range , shape and other parameters , which can be adjusted to the appropriate values as more derivatives of delta functions are included .",
    "to renormalize the interaction , we consider the relative hamiltonian ( [ eq : rel2b ] ) and solve the corresponding schrdinger equation , @xmath50\\psi(\\vec{r } ) = 2 \\frac{e}{\\omega}\\psi(\\vec{r } ) , \\label{eq : contact2b}\\ ] ] in a finite model space defined by @xmath51 .",
    "since the delta function acts only on @xmath13 waves , we consider here only those waves . the solution @xmath52 can be expanded in the complete set of ho wave functions @xmath53 with @xmath54 the @xmath13-state solutions of the unperturbed ho , @xmath55 in terms of generalized laguerre polynomials .",
    "one can easily verify that the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ eq : contact2b ] ) are given by the consistency condition @xmath56    at this point , the coupling constant @xmath57 is undetermined .",
    "we can fix the value of @xmath57 at each @xmath21 by requiring that we reproduce a given measured level @xmath58 of two trapped fermions @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental values are very close to the the theoretical prediction of a pseudopotential , given @xcite by the transcendental equation @xmath59 where @xmath0 is the two - body scattering length in the absence of the trap .",
    "( for discussions about the limits of applicability of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigv_lo ] ) , see ref .",
    "the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigv_lo ] ) come in levels , and we can use any of the low - energy states to fix the value of @xmath57 . here",
    "we use the most natural choice , the ground state .",
    "once we adjust the strength of the two - body term for each @xmath21 value ( and , in general , @xmath6 ) , we can perform few- and many - body calculations .",
    "the many - body model spaces for @xmath60 are chosen so that the two - body truncation is included consistently in relative coordinates @xcite .",
    "note that if one wants negative - parity states , one has to truncate the many - body space to odd @xmath21 . in this case , we use a two - body interaction that is adjusted to the largest even number below @xmath21 , that is , @xmath61 .",
    "results for the energies of few - fermion systems are in general complicated functions of @xmath21 and @xmath6 . in the unitary regime",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 gets simpler . when @xmath27 , the two - body spectrum of eq .",

    "( [ c0run ] ) that the @xmath6 dependence factorizes : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is dimensionless and @xmath6 independent .",

    "this was to be expected , given that for @xmath11 the only energy parameter is @xmath6 , which also sets the size of the system .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the proportionality constant between @xmath37 and @xmath6 is related to the short - distance scaling exponent @xmath69 of the wave function .",
    "the three - fermion spectrum has been solved semi - analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the ground - state energies for @xmath70 have recently been calculated in the case of a short - range potential @xcite .    in the opposite limit @xmath28 ,",
    "the trap is removed .",
    "( [ eq : eigv_lo ] ) gives expected results .",
    "there is a single two - body bound state of energy @xmath71 , if the two - body interaction is sufficiently strong , @xmath72 .",
    "all other states have energies @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , and correspond to scattering states .",
    "when @xmath75 , the interaction is weak and the spectra of all few - body systems are expected to approach those of non - interacting fermions in a ho .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ c0run ] ) : as @xmath75 the two - body ground - state energy approaches @xmath76 , leading to a divergence from the @xmath77 contribution and to @xmath78 . in this limit",
    "all few - body energies should be set by occupation of ho levels .",
    "for example , all other two - body levels are given by the poles in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ c0run ] ) .",
    "whether few - body bound states exist when the interaction is sufficiently attractive will be discussed below .    in any case , at the end of the calculation we extrapolate to the limit @xmath23 . as we show in the next section",
    ", this extrapolation is relatively smooth .",
    "our approach can be straightforwardly extended to higher orders . at the two - body level , we add to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) interactions proportional to derivatives of the delta function , starting with an @xmath13-wave range correction of relative @xmath79 @xcite . a @xmath80-wave interaction ( the most important between like components )",
    "appears at @xmath81 . for spin-1/2 fermions",
    "contact three- and more - body forces act in @xmath80 and higher waves , so these forces are of relative @xmath82 or higher @xcite .",
    "many - body properties are thus to a high degree determined by two - body forces alone .",
    "the two - body parameters can be determined from an extension of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigv_lo ] ) to non - negligible - range interactions @xcite .",
    "in this section , we apply the method introduced in the previous section to the description of systems of three and four identical fermions in a harmonic trap .",
    "we consider the unitary regime @xmath83 as well as a general non - vanishing @xmath26 value , for both positive and negative scattering lengths .    in the three - body calculation , we have employed two numerical methods . in the first stage , we have used the three - body code in relative coordinates employed in ref .",
    "thus , to handle three identical fermions of spin @xmath84 we allow interaction only in the @xmath17 channel , calculating the isospin @xmath85 solution . in a second stage , we have developed a new program that can handle fermions of arbitrary spin , dropping the isospin from the possible quantum numbers .",
    "both codes produce the same results for fermions of spin 1/2 , but the latter can be extended to larger @xmath21 .",
    "we should point out that in order to correctly antisymmetrize the three - body system , we include all possible @xmath86 states in each model space .",
    "therefore , although we show below only results for the levels that are affected by the contact interaction , we also obtain energy levels that are left unchanged .",
    "( for example , states with @xmath87 can be obtained from addition of two @xmath88 relative angular momenta and total spin @xmath89 or @xmath90 ; however , in such channels the contact interaction is not present since it appears only for @xmath91 . )",
    "figure [ fig : lowsp_3b ] presents the main results of our investigation of the unitary regime .",
    "we show the dependence of the lowest - energy levels ( labeled by their spin and parity , @xmath92 ) in units of @xmath6 as function of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath21 .",
    "we have verified numerically that , indeed , @xmath6 factorizes , as we have argued in the previous section .",
    "the running of the low - lying energies is fairly smooth when one increases the ultraviolet cutoff , and allows an extrapolation to the limit @xmath93 however , we find that the running depends on the state considered . in order to qualify this statement , we assume a running of the form @xmath94 with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 fitting parameters . in a previous publication @xcite",
    ", we assumed a running for the energy of the many - body system of the form @xmath98 , where @xmath99 was defined as the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "( because here the solutions depend trivially on @xmath6 , we do not have to include it in the definition of the cutoff . )",
    "this was motivated by the running in the continuum two - body system . here",
    "we carry out a more detailed investigation of the running of the three - body solution with the ultraviolet cutoff . allowing @xmath97 to vary in the fit",
    ", we find values between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we find that , in general , the values of @xmath95 are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath97 , but can depend on the features of the running and the values of @xmath21 included in the fit .",

    "[ cap : j12m][cap : j32p ] we present our estimates for @xmath107 for the states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowsp_3b ] . in our approach , there are two sources of errors : on one hand , we neglect higher - order terms in the expansion of the interaction ( terms involving derivatives of contact interactions ) and , on the other hand , we perform a fit of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitform ] ) to obtain the large-@xmath21 limit .",
    "the variation with @xmath21 allows us to estimate errors associated with missing terms ; thus , for low - lying states , even fairly small values of @xmath21 produce results within about @xmath108 of the extrapolated values . on the other hand , we find that , in general , the extrapolation errors coming from fits to large values of @xmath21 are very small . for the levels shown in tables [ cap : j12m][cap : j32p ]",

    "we find that the components with the lowest - energy configuration dominate for @xmath118 , while other configurations reshuffle small contributions in each model space .",
    "however , this situation changes , with a larger contribution of the higher shells , for a stronger interaction such as for @xmath127 .",
    "this is not surprising since a stronger interaction becomes more important across shells . ) adding higher - order terms should decrease the magnitude of @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitform ] ) , thereby allowing for a more precise determination of observables in few- and many - body systems .    in principle , we could extend our method even further .",
    "first , we can perform similar calculations of other observables ( e.g. , r.m.s .",
    "radii ) , with more particles , as well as for fermions of different spin . especially for the latter it will be interesting to investigate the ability of the method to predict efimov states in a finite model space . in the case of untrapped multi - state fermions ,",
    "the eft power counting requires a contact three - body force to prevent the collapse of the three - body system @xcite .",
    "finally , the same type of approach can be considered in nuclear physics , where addition of a cm harmonic term to the intrinsic hamiltonian produces effectively the same type of two - body relative hamiltonian as in eq .",
