    "we thus use this density in the thermal model .",
    "the temperature in the thermal model is determined by fitting the measured pion to nucleon ratio , which is about @xmath114 including pions and nucleons from decays of @xmath4 resonances  @xcite , without medium effects and with unity fugacity parameters for all particles , and the value is @xmath115  mev . the assumption that pions and @xmath4 resonances are in chemical equilibrium is consistent with the short chemical equilibration times estimated from the pion and @xmath4 resonance production rates .",
    "the isospin asymmetry of the hadronic matter is then taken to be @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , corresponding to net charge densities of @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , for the three symmetry energies given by @xmath58 , @xmath122 , and @xmath110 , respectively , in order to reproduce the @xmath101 ratios of @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 predicted by the ibuu transport model of ref .  @xcite using corresponding symmetry energies without pion in - medium effects .",
    "since medium effects enhance the pion and @xmath4 resonance densities , to maintain same pion to nucleon ratio as the measured one requires fugacity parameters for pions and @xmath4 resonances to be less than one . also , the pion in - medium effects have been shown to affect only slightly the pion and the @xmath4 resonance abundance  @xcite , indicating that both pions and @xmath4 resonances are out of chemical equilibrium with nucleons when medium effects are included , as expected from estimated increasing pion and @xmath4 resonance chemical equilibration times as a result of medium effects . because of the small number of pions ( about 0.3% ) and @xmath4 ( about 1.1% ) resonances in the matter , the density , temperature , and net charge density of the hadronic matter are expected to remain unchanged when pion in - medium effects are introduced .",

    "figure  [ ratio ] further shows results obtained with larger values of @xmath140 , @xmath122 and @xmath133 for the migdal parameter .",
    "it is seen that the isospin - dependent pion in - medium effects in these cases are not much different from the case of @xmath94 , indicating that the pion abundance in hot dense asymmetric nuclear matter is affected more by the @xmath0-wave , which does not depend on @xmath71 , than by the @xmath1-wave interaction between pion and nucleon .",
    "in summary , we have studied the dependence of the pion spectral function in asymmetric nuclear matter on the charge of the pion by using results from the chiral perturbation theory for the pion - nucleon @xmath0-wave interaction and from the @xmath4-hole model for the pion - nucleon @xmath1-wave interaction . because of increasing @xmath8 and decreasing @xmath9 in - medium masses due to the pion - nucleon @xmath0-wave interaction in neutron - rich matter , the strength of @xmath9 spectral function at low energies is somewhat larger than that of @xmath8 spectral function , and the strength around the peak of the @xmath4 resonance mass distribution decreases while that near the threshold increases with increasing charge of the @xmath4 resonance . in a thermal model that assumes that nucleons , pions , and @xmath4 resonances produced in heavy ion collisions",
    "are in thermal but not chemical equilibrium , with the latter needed to maintain the final pion to nucleon ratio , the @xmath101 ratio is slightly reduced in comparison with the case without pion in - medium effects .",
    "taking into consideration of the isospin - dependent pion in - medium effects in the transport model thus would have some , albeit not very significant , effects on the extraction of the nuclear symmetry energy from measured @xmath101 ratio . on the other hand , the predicted @xmath141 ratio for a given parametrization of the symmetry energy can be quite different in different transport models .",
    "for example , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath101 ratio in hot dense nuclear matter increases with increasing stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy at high densities if the latter is parameterized using the relativistic mean - field model , opposite to the results from the ibuu model  @xcite which shows a decreasing @xmath101 ratio with increasing stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "also , it was recently shown in an improved isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamic ( imiqmd ) model that the measured @xmath101 ratio from the fopi collaboration is consistent with a nuclear symmetry energy that is even stiffer than the one corresponding to the symmetry energy parameter @xmath58 in the mdi interaction  @xcite , contradictory to the conclusion from the ibuu model  @xcite that a symmetry energy softer than @xmath60 is needed to reproduce the measured @xmath101 ratio .",
    "further theoretical work is thus needed to understand the relation between the @xmath101 ratio and the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy at high densities in the transport model description of heavy ion collisions .",

    "<S> using results from the chiral perturbation theory for the @xmath0-wave interaction and the delta - resonance model for the @xmath1-wave interaction of pions with nucleons , we have evaluated the spectral functions of pions in asymmetric nuclear matter with unequal proton and neutron densities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in hot dense neutron - rich matter the strength of the spectral function of positively charged pion at low energies is somewhat larger than that of negatively charged pion . in a thermal model , </S>",
    "<S> this isospin - dependent effect slightly reduces the ratio of negatively charged to positively charged pions that are produced in heavy ion collisions induced by radioactive beams . </S>",
    "<S> relevance of our results to the determination of the nuclear symmetry energy from measured ratio of negatively to positively charged pions produced in heavy ion collisions is discussed . </S>"
