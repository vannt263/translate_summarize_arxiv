    "soon after quasars were first discovered , @xcite found them to evolve strongly with redshift . in the following 25 years , a consensus has been reached that the number density of optical quasars peaks at @xmath17 , and declines towards both lower and higher redshifts .",
    "the luminosity function of optical quasars at @xmath18 has been well studied through uv - excess and slitless spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . at the high - redshift end , both multicolor surveys ( @xcite , who hereafter ; @xcite , dposs hereafter ) and grism surveys ( @xcite , ssg here after ) have shown that the number density of quasars declines rapidly from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the sample sizes for these surveys are relatively small , so the rate of this decline and the shape of the high - redshift quasar luminosity function are not nearly as well - constrained as at low redshift .",
    "the quasar luminosity function provides important constraints for models of quasar evolution ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and the nature of the high - redshift uv ionizing field ( @xcite ) .    in paper iii ( @xcite )",
    ", we presented a sample of 39 quasars at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , selected from 182 deg@xmath23 of fall equatorial stripe multicolor imaging data taken during the commissioning phase of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the selection completeness function of this multicolor sample is calculated based on model quasar colors . in this paper , we derive the high - redshift quasar luminosity function based on the quasar sample and selection function presented in paper iii . in  2 , we use three different statistical approaches to find the luminosity function : a @xmath6 estimator ; a maximum likelihood solution ; and lynden - bell s non - parametric @xmath24 estimator ( @xcite ) . in  3 , we discuss the rate of decline of the quasar spatial density towards high redshift and the shape of the quasar luminosity function based on the results of  2 , and compare these new results with those of previous studies . in  4 , we discuss possible selection biases on the evolution of the luminosity function and theoretical implications of our results .",
    "the differential quasar luminosity function , @xmath25 , is defined as the number of quasars per unit comoving volume , per unit luminosity as a function of luminosity and redshift .",
    "it can also be written as @xmath26 , the number of quasars per unit comoving volume , per unit absolute magnitude : @xmath27 throughout the paper , we use @xmath25 for the mathematical derivations , while we present our final results in terms of the more familiar @xmath26 .",
    "the quasar luminosity function can also be presented in the cumulative form : @xmath28 .",
    "in general , the redshift and luminosity dependences of the quasar luminosity function are not separable . in limiting cases ,",
    "@xmath25 can be represented either in the form of pure density evolution : @xmath29 where the luminosity function remains the same shape , but with different normalization at different redshift ; or in the form of pure luminosity evolution @xmath30/g(z),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , the characteristic luminosity , is a function of redshift while the normalization of the luminosity function is a constant .",
    "it might be better presented by a combination of the two cases above ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath32/g(z).\\ ] ]    for @xmath33 , pure luminosity evolution provides a good fit to the quasar luminosity function ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . at @xmath34 ,",
    "existing quasar samples are still too small to distinguish these models . in general , the evolution can be more complicated .",
    "for example , the luminosity function at low and high redshifts may be determined by very different physics and have totally different shapes . note that if the luminosity function is a power law , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 does not depend on @xmath37 , there is no characteristic luminosity , and pure luminosity and pure density evolution can not be distinguished .",
    "the determination of the high - redshift quasar luminosity function from a flux - limited sample faces several difficulties : ( 1 ) the selection function of a multicolor survey is a strong function of luminosity , redshift and the shape of the quasar spectral energy distribution ( sed , see paper iii ) ; the selection bias has to be corrected for carefully .",
    "( 2 ) the high - redshift quasar samples are typically small ( the largest complete sample of quasars at @xmath38 prior to this work has 10 objects ) .",
    "the small sample size makes it difficult to parameterize the luminosity function , and the result is also strongly affected by the choice of binning . ( 3 ) as the redshift increases , an optical survey samples different parts of the quasar s intrinsic spectrum . when comparing results from low and high redshift samples , the k - correction is large and quite uncertain , due to the lack of statistics on the continuum shape between the rest - frame uv and optical region of high - redshift quasars",
    ".    the luminosity function can be derived using either non - parametric or parametric methods .",
    "the most commonly used non - parametric method is the @xmath39 estimator ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we present the @xmath39 results in  2.1 . in  2.2 , we generalize the test of correlation between luminosity and redshift distributions described in @xcite and @xcite , by including the selection function .",
    "we show that for the limited range of redshift and luminosity our survey covers , the two distributions are not correlated . thus in  2.3 , we assume that the luminosity and redshift dependences are separable , and that the quasar density follows a power law in luminosity and depends on redshift exponentially .",
    "the maximum likelihood solutions are derived following the method of @xcite , where each quasar is treated as a @xmath40 function in parameter space , and the results are not subject to binning .",
    "when the density and luminosity evolution can be separated , one can also use the lynden - bell s @xmath24 estimator ( @xcite ) to calculate the non - parametric marginal distributions of the cumulative luminosity function along the luminosity and redshift directions . in appendix",
    "a , we show how to generalize the @xmath24 estimator to include the survey selection function .",
    "the luminosity function estimated using the @xmath24 estimator is presented in  2.4 .",
    "the results throughout this paper are presented for two cosmological models : ( 1 ) a model with @xmath41 and @xmath42 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , which we refer to as the @xmath43 model .",
    "most of the previous studies of the quasar luminosity function have used this cosmology .",
    "( 2 ) a @xmath44-dominated flat model with @xmath45 , @xmath44=0.65 , and @xmath46 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which we refer to as the @xmath44-model .",
    "the luminosity function is presented in term of @xmath47 , the absolute ab magnitude of the quasar continuum in the rest - frame at 1450  . assuming a power law @xmath48 , schmidt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find : @xmath49 where the effective wavelength of the kron - cousins b band is 4400  , and the factor 0.12 comes from the zero point difference between the ab and vega - based magnitude systems for quasar - like spectra .",
    "we first calculate the space density of quasars in different luminosity and redshift bins using the @xmath39 method following the discussions in who and dposs .",
    "the available volume @xmath51 is defined for a quasar of given luminosity and sed as the comoving volume over which the quasar could have been detected by the survey . in the presence of a selection function ,",
    "the available volume is weighted by the selection probability .",
    "if one is to determine the luminosity in luminosity and redshift bins @xmath52 , the available volume for a quasar with given @xmath53 , @xmath37 and sed is : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the selection probability of the quasar as a function of redshift , luminosity and the sed .",
    "the luminosity function and its statistical uncertainty can be estimated as : @xmath56 @xmath57^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the average luminosity and redshift over the bin , the sum is over all the objects in the bin , and the available volume @xmath60 is calculated for each object .    in paper iii ,",
    "two flavors of selection probability are calculated : ( 1 ) the probability for a given quasar sed shape , @xmath61 $ ] , where @xmath62 is the slope of the power law continuum and ew(ly@xmath62+nv ) is the rest - frame equivalent width of the ly@xmath62+nv emission line .",
    "these two parameters characterize the shape of the sed .",
    "the selection probability of each quasar in the sample is listed in table 4 of paper iii .",
    "( 2 ) the average selection probability @xmath63 (  5.3 in paper iii ) , averaged over the intrinsic distribution of @xmath62 and ew . in paper iii",
    ", we assume that this distribution is the product of gaussians in @xmath62 and @xmath64 , and find that their mean and standard deviations are : @xmath65 and @xmath66  . in figure 1 , we present the @xmath39 results of the quasar luminosity function using both flavors of selection probability under the @xmath3 and the @xmath44-model cosmologies .",
    "figure 1(a ) and ( b ) are for the @xmath3 model . in figure 1(a ) , the density is calculated using the average selection function @xmath67 , while in figure 1(b ) , the density is calculated using the selection probability of each quasar for its sed type , @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "similarly , figure 1(c ) and ( d ) are for the @xmath44-model . in each case",
    ", we divide the sample of 39 quasars in 3 redshift bins : @xmath69 ( 18 quasars ) , @xmath70 ( 14 quasars ) and @xmath71 ( 7 quasars ) .",
    "the redshift bins are further divided into two or three luminosity bins .",
    "there are 3  6 quasars in each bin .",
    "the different methods of treating the selection function give consistent results .",
    "this can be understood as follows . for simplicity",
    ", we ignore the dependence on ew , @xmath37 and @xmath53 , and assume that the quasar distribution only depends on @xmath62 . for an intrinsic distribution function @xmath72 ) and",
    "a selection function @xmath73 ) , the observed distribution will be @xmath74 . in the discrete case , @xmath75 .",
    "the effective density of quasars can be estimated as : @xmath76 alternatively , if we define the average selection probability : @xmath77 then the density can also be estimated as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the total number of objects observed . therefore , if , as we have assumed , the sed shape is not a function of redshift or luminosity , the two approaches only differ in the different weightings applied to the observed @xmath80 distribution ; in eq . ( 11 ) , each object is given the same weight and normalized by the _ average _ selection probability .",
    "the two methods should give consistent results if the sample is large enough and all the sed shapes are properly sampled .",
    "however , as we showed in paper iii , there are regions in the @xmath81 parameter space poorly sampled by the selection criteria ( @xmath82 ) . in this case",
    ", the average probability @xmath67 is much better behaved , and we will use it for most of the analyses which follow . due to the small number of quasars in each bin , the appearance of figure 1 changes somewhat with different binning , but the general trends are obvious : ( 1 ) the overall density of quasars declines rapidly with redshift . for the @xmath41 model ,",
    "the density of quasars at @xmath83 decreases from @xmath84 mpc@xmath85 mag@xmath5 at @xmath86 to @xmath87 mpc@xmath85 mag@xmath5 at @xmath88 .",
    "( 2 ) the luminosity function rises towards lower luminosity by a factor of @xmath89 per magnitude .",
    "these results are very similar for the @xmath44-model . at @xmath90 , the behavior of the @xmath3 and @xmath44 models are quite similar , as @xmath91 when the redshift becomes large .      in this subsection",
    ", we test whether the intrinsic luminosity and redshift distributions of the quasar sample are correlated or whether they can be treated separately ( as in the case of pure density evolution , eq .",
    "2 ) . at low redshift ,",
    "the luminosity function can be fit with a double power law ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sample in this paper covers a limited range of absolute magnitude ( @xmath2 ) and a limited redshift range ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "if , in this case , the luminosity function can be fit with a single power law whose slope is independent of the redshift , the luminosity and redshift distributions of our sample are not expected to be correlated .",
    "this correlation test is also crucial for the non - parametric @xmath24 estimator in  2.4 , which requires that the data be expressed in terms of two uncorrelated variables .",
    "correlation tests for truncated data sets ( such as flux - limited samples ) have been developed by efron & petrosian ( 1992 ) and @xcite . in our survey , there is essentially no bright - end truncation in the selection ( the saturation limit is @xmath92 , four magnitudes brighter than the brightest quasar in the sample ) .",
    "thus , our data set @xmath93 is one - side truncated in luminosity .",
    "we first consider the case in which the selection function is a step function and the selection boundary is sharp : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the limiting luminosity at a given redshift . in this case , following the discussion in @xcite , one first defines the _ comparable _ or associated set for each object @xmath96 : @xmath97 consisting of all objects which are brighter than the object in question and which would be selected by the survey if they had the same luminosity as the object in question .",
    "this is the same set that will be used in the @xmath24 estimator below .",
    "it is the _ luminosity _ and _ volume _ limited subset of the sample that can be constructed for each object . if @xmath37 and @xmath53 are independent , the rank @xmath98 of @xmath99 in the comparable set , defined as @xmath100 should be distributed uniformly between 0 and @xmath101 , where @xmath101 is the number of points in the comparable set for each object ( not including the object in question ) .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath98 , is @xmath102 and the variance @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , one can construct kendell s @xmath104 statistic : @xmath105 for @xmath106 , the luminosity and redshift would not be correlated at @xmath107 level and could be treated independently .",
    "however , the discussion above only applies to a sample with a sharp boundary . for the quasar survey",
    "we discuss in this paper , even though the selection criteria have a sharp cut at the limiting apparent magnitude ( @xmath108 for @xmath109 selected quasars and @xmath110 for @xmath111 selected quasars , see paper iii ) , the selection function smoothly approaches zero at the limiting luminosity ( figure 8 of paper iii ) .",
    "there is no one - to - one correspondence between the apparent @xmath112 magnitude and the luminosity of the quasar at a given redshift , due to scatter in the quasar sed shape and photometric errors in the sdss measurements .",
    "we thus generalize the correlation test to include the selection function @xmath67 .",
    "first , we define a generalized comparable set : @xmath113 which includes all the objects more luminous than the object in question , since all might have a selection probability between 0 and 1 .",
    "we then define the total number in the set by weighting each point @xmath114 in the comparable set @xmath115 .",
    "this weight is proportional to @xmath116 , the selection probability if the object @xmath114 had the same luminosity @xmath117 as the object in question ( object @xmath96 ) , and it is proportional to the inverse of its own selection probability @xmath118 .",
    "it is useful to define a quantity @xmath119 : @xmath120 the definition of the rank changes accordingly : @xmath121 the expectation value of the distribution @xmath98 is @xmath122 , and the variance @xmath123 .",
    "the test statistic @xmath124 is defined in the same way as in eq .",
    "note that these definitions return to its normal form if the selection function has a sharp boundary , since @xmath125 when @xmath126 . in the case where the selection boundary is smooth ,",
    "the ranking is weighted by @xmath127 .",
    "the selection probability always increases with larger luminosity and smaller photometric error .",
    "therefore , since @xmath128 for @xmath129 , the weight is always between 0 and 1 . in appendix a , we prove that the comparable set defined in this way gives the correct @xmath24 estimator for the luminosity function in the presence of a selection function .",
    "we calculate the ranking statistic @xmath104 of the sdss equatorial stripe quasar sample using the average selection function in paper iii . for the @xmath41 model , @xmath130 ; for the @xmath44 model , @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , for the limited redshift and luminosity range this sample covers , the two distributions can be treated independently . for the full quasar sample of the main sdss survey which will cover a much larger redshift and luminosity range ,",
    "the possibility of luminosity evolution will need to be introduced .",
    "the ranking technique presented here can then be used to determine the functional form of the luminosity evolution ( @xmath31 in eq .",
    "3 ) of the quasar population ( e.g. maloney & petrosian 1999 ) .      in this subsection ,",
    "we model the luminosity function using the result above that the redshift and luminosity dependences are separable .",
    "imagine dividing up the sample into small bins in @xmath53 and @xmath37 , @xmath117 and @xmath132 , with sizes @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the likelihood that @xmath135 quasars are found in the ( @xmath117 , @xmath132 ) bin can be written as : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the average number of quasars expected in the bin : @xmath138 where @xmath25 is the differential luminosity function , and the integral is over the bin .",
    "the maximum likelihood solution is obtained by minimizing the function @xmath139 with respect to the parameters describing the luminosity function .",
    "one could find the maximum likehood solution by fitting the @xmath39 results in  2.1 , but the result would be strongly affected by the choice of binning for a small sample .",
    "however , in the limit of an infinitesimal bin size , @xmath135 is either 0 and 1 , and the result is not dependent on binning . following @xcite , the likelihood function can then be written as : @xmath140 +   2 \\int\\!\\ !",

    "the integral is over the entire @xmath141 range of the survey , and is equals to the number of quasars expected in the survey for a given luminosity function .",
    "this term provides the normalization for the likelihood function .",

    "( 22 ) , the integral term provides a normalization .",
    "these two expressions are closely related .",
    "if we define @xmath144 , then for any parameter @xmath145 , it can be shown that @xmath146 thus if we constrain the total number of objects expected based on the maximum likelihood solution to be equal to the total number actually observed , @xmath147 , eqs .",
    "( 22 ) and ( 24 ) are maximized at the same parameters . in practice , they give almost identical results .    the calculation in  2.2 shows that the luminosity and redshift distributions of the quasar sample are not correlated .",
    "we assume that the quasar density is a power law function of the quasar luminosity : @xmath148 , or , expressed in terms of absolute magnitude , @xmath149 .",
    "following ssg , we further assume that the density at a given luminosity declines exponentially with redshift @xmath150 .",

    "the sdss luminosity function is somewhat flatter than that of ssg , although the difference is only at the 1-@xmath161 level , and is based on rather small sample sizes .",
    "note , however , that the median redshift of the sdss sample ( @xmath90 ) is considerably higher than that of ssg s ( @xmath215 ) , which could have an effect on the luminosity function slope ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the consistency of these two surveys is important because they used totally different selection methods and have very different selection functions : ssg is a slitless spectroscopic survey whose selection is based on the detection of emission lines in grism spectra .",
    "it is therefore is biased towards quasars with strong emission lines , but is not selected on the continuum shape of the quasars . on the other hand ,",
    "the sdss sample selection is based on broad - band colors .",
    "it depends on the strength of the emission lines rather weakly , but is biased towards objects with stronger continuum breaks and/or bluer continua , and is not sensitive to red quasars ( @xmath216 , see the discussion in paper iii ) .",
    "the who survey ( @xcite ) and the dposs survey ( @xcite ) used broad - band colors to select quasar candidates .",
    "these studies are based on photographic photometry from schmidt plates , which typically have photometric errors @xmath217 mag .",
    "they use a very similar simulation technique to paper iii to correct for selection effects , although they suffer from a larger selection incompleteness ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "the who survey covers an effective area of 43 deg@xmath23 down to @xmath219 .",
    "it contains 86 quasars at @xmath220 , including 8 at @xmath221 and 2 at @xmath38 .",
    "they found that the quasar number density drops by a factor of @xmath8 from @xmath222 to @xmath223 , although given the small number of objects in their sample , the rate of evolution is poorly constrained .",
    "the dposs survey includes 10 quasars at @xmath38 and @xmath224 , covering 681 deg@xmath23 .",
    "they derive the quasar luminosity function at their median redshift @xmath225 . in figure 4",
    ", we compare the cumulative quasar luminosity function from the sdss sample at @xmath226 with the results from these three previous surveys .",
    "the results are all consistent within the error bars . note that although the two previous multicolor surveys needed a much larger selection correction than the sdss sample , the final corrected results agree with one another quite well .",
    "the comparisons above show that the decline of the number density of luminous quasars from optical surveys is unlikely to be strongly affected by either the selection technique or the correction for the selection functions . in  4.1 ,",
    "we discuss the effect of k - correction and extinction on the evolution of high - redshift quasar densities .",
    "using the sdss sample , we find that at @xmath13 and @xmath227 , the shape of the quasar luminosity function can be fitted with a power law @xmath228 where the power law index is the average of the results from maximum likelihood and @xmath24 estimators .    at @xmath15 , the quasar luminosity function",
    "is often fitted with a double power law : @xmath229 } + 10^{0.4[(\\beta_2 + 1)(m_b - m_b^*(z ) ) ] } } , \\ ] ] in the expression above , pure luminosity evolution is assumed , with a redshift dependence given by the evolution of the characteristic luminosity @xmath230 .",
    "boyle et al . ( 2000 ) find that for the 2df sample , the normalization of the luminosity function @xmath231 mpc@xmath85 mag@xmath5 , the faint end slope @xmath232 , and the bright end slope @xmath233 ( the @xmath3 model ) .",
    "the error bar on the slopes @xmath234 and @xmath235 are @xmath236 .",
    "if we assume that the luminosity function in eq .",
    "( 37 ) applies to @xmath90 , i.e. , the shape of the luminosity function remains the same while only the characteristic luminosity @xmath230 varies , we find that in order to match our results at @xmath237 , we must have @xmath238 , more than one magnitude fainter than our survey limit . therefore , the sdss results in this paper clearly probe the bright end of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "the results on the bright - end slope of the low - redshift quasar luminosity function from various surveys appear to be quite robust : @xmath239 , with @xmath240 ( boyle et al .",
    "1988 , hewett et al .",
    "1991 , pei 1995 , boyle et al .",
    "2000 ) , much steeper than our high - redshift results ( @xmath241 ) . at low redshift ,",
    "the quasar number density drops by a factor of @xmath242 per magnitude at the bright end , while at @xmath90 , it only drops by a factor of 4 .",
    "we can further test the significance of this discrepancy .",
    "we derive a new maximum likelihood solution from the sdss sample by forcing the slope of the luminosity @xmath243 but allowing the normalization @xmath244 and the redshift evolution @xmath62 to vary in the luminosity function ( eq .",
    "this is shown as the dashed line in figure 5 .",
    "the luminosity function from the sdss sample using both the @xmath24 estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator from figure 2 are shown as the points and solid line in the figure .",
    "it is evident that this steep slope is not consistent with the data .",
    "the statistic @xmath245 ( eq .",
    "22 ) of the maximum likelihood solution follows a @xmath246 distribution . in this case , the likelihood ratio for a specific @xmath247 can be estimated by calculating @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is the minimum @xmath245 value when all three parameters are allowed to vary , and @xmath250 is the @xmath245 value if @xmath36 is fixed to be @xmath247 and the other two parameters are allowed to vary .",
    "we find that by forcing @xmath243 , @xmath251 with two degrees of freedom .",
    "this corresponds to a probability @xmath252 , so the two slopes are inconsistent at @xmath253 2.5-@xmath161 level .",
    "we can use another method to estimate the significance of the inconsistency between low and high - redshift slopes : there are six quasars at @xmath254 in the sample . using the model with @xmath243",
    ", only @xmath255 quasars are predicted over the whole survey .",
    "the probability of @xmath256 quasars being observed in our survey is only @xmath257 from possion statistics .",
    "it is unlikely that this flattening arises because we are missing a large fraction of low luminosity quasars .",
    "the photometric errors are quite small and the selection function is very uniform as a function of magnitude ( figure 8 of paper iii ) for all objects a few tenths of a magnitude brighter than the survey limit .",
    "figure 5 shows that the slope is much flatter than @xmath258 even over the three most luminous magnitude bins .",
    "thus the bright end slope of the quasar luminosity function is considerably flatter at @xmath90 than at @xmath259 .",
    "note that ssg find @xmath260 , while their median redshift is somewhat lower .",
    "the flattening of the bright end luminosity function at high - redshift , if confirmed using a larger sample , indicates that the evolution of quasar luminosity function at @xmath34 can not be pure luminosity evolution , unlike the case for @xmath15 .",
    "instead , the shape of the quasar luminosity function evolves with redshift as well .",
    "figure 3 shows that the comoving quasar number density peaks at @xmath261 , and drops by a factor of @xmath262 from @xmath263 to 5 .",
    "this decline is evident in all optical high - redshift quasar surveys to date .",
    "however , these results might be biased by three factors : the survey incompleteness ; uncertainties in the k - correction when comparing low and high redshift results ; and the possibility that a large fraction of quasars are not detectable in optical survey due to dust extinction .    in paper iii , we show that the survey selection criteria are only sensitive to a range of the quasar sed shapes , and that the incompleteness is a function of redshift .",
    "when calculating the luminosity function , we first correct this incompleteness by assuming that the distribution of the continuum power - law index @xmath62 is a gaussian with mean @xmath264 and standard deviation @xmath265 . at @xmath266 ,",
    "the survey is sensitive for quasars even with @xmath267 , although no quasars with @xmath268 are detected in the sample . at @xmath11 ,",
    "the survey is not sensitive to quasars with @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , the density at @xmath13 could be underestimated if there was a significant contribution from quasars at @xmath269 that we failed to detect . however , since we are not biased against these red quasars at the highest redshift bin ( @xmath198 ) , the strong decline in the quasar density seen at @xmath214 will not be affected by them .",
    "since our selection is not sensitive to very red quasars ( @xmath270 ) , if there were a large population of such objects _ only _ at high redshift , the inferred density decline at high redshift from our color - selected sample might be an overestimate .",
    "but as we pointed out in  3.1 , the same decline is observed in a spectroscopically selected sample ( ssg ) , which argues that neither survey suffers from large incompleteness .",
    "low - redshift quasar luminosity functions usually are expressed in the rest - frame b band magnitude @xmath271 .",
    "when comparing with high - redshift results , which are measured in the rest - frame uv ( e.g. @xmath47 ) , a k - correction is needed .",
    "it is customary to assume a @xmath272 power law continuum for the k - correction .",
    "an incorrect k - correction might result in a large difference in density .",
    "in fact , we find that the uv continua of quasars at @xmath13 is better fit with @xmath273 , a value that was also found in the similar sized sample of @xmath34 quasars ( schneider , schmidt & gunn 1991 ) . a change of continuum slope by 0.4 will result in a 0.2 mag difference in the k - correction , or a 30% difference in quasar density .",
    "however , when we compare the observed results at @xmath90 with @xmath259 the situation is actually better than this calculated difference would imply .",
    "the low - redshift quasar surveys ( such as 2df ) are selected based on the observed @xmath206-band magnitude ( @xmath274 ) . at @xmath259 ,",
    "the @xmath206-band corresponds to 1470   in the rest - frame , almost the same as the case in which we select @xmath13 quasars based on their @xmath275 band measurements ( @xmath276 ) .",
    "therefore , both results are based on the rest - frame uv flux ; the comparison is not strongly affected by the k - correction , as long as the two results are transferred to the rest - frame b - band in the same way .",
    "the presence of dust might bias the results on quasar evolution .",
    "dust could arise along the line of sight in the damped ly@xmath62 systems , or in the quasar environment .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of dust in damped ly@xmath62 systems on the determination of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "they found that 10% - 70% of quasars at @xmath277 could be missed from optical surveys whose selection was based on b band magnitudes .",
    "this fraction can not be calculated precisely , due to uncertainties in the dust content and dust distribution in damped ly@xmath62 systems .",
    "but the effect of intervening dust must increase quickly with redshift , both because the total number of damped systems increases , and because the extinction curve rises sharply towards the rest - frame uv .",
    "the number density of quasars at @xmath38 could be significantly affected by dust along the line of sight , but it is not clear whether it is enough to change the general trend of the decline .",
    "high - redshift quasars are known to reside in dusty environments ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the new millimeter and submillimeter surveys have revealed a population of high - redshift dusty galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of dust extinction changes the bolometric correction from the rest - frame uv luminosity observed in the optical surveys .",
    "if the bolometric correction is a strong function of redshift , the evolution of the bolometric luminosity function of quasars could be very different from that of optically selected quasars .",
    "however , we ve seen that the @xmath62 distribution of @xmath278 quasars is quite similar to that of lower - redshift quasars , implying that the objects in our sample are no more reddened than those at low redshift .",
    "thus in order to invoke dust to explain the decline of optical quasars with redshift , one would require a completely separate , very extincted population of objects whose numbers increase with redshift .",
    "radio and x - ray selected samples are not strongly affected by dust extinction .",
    "@xcite found that the space density of high - redshift radio quasars also declines rapidly at @xmath34 . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that there is no evidence for a decrease in the number density of rosat - selected x - ray quasars at @xmath34 , although the statistical significance of this result is only marginal .",
    "one difficulty is how to normalize the results from different wavelength samples . at @xmath277 ,",
    "the spatial density of the quasars in the @xcite sample is considerably higher than in the ssg sample , which implies that these x - ray quasars are intrinsically fainter objects than those in ssg .",
    "the redshift evolution is expected to depend on luminosity , and there are theoretical reasons to believe that the evolution is flatter at low luminosities ( see below ) .",
    "studies of the quasar luminosity function put important constraints on models of quasar evolution .",
    "haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) show that the observed quasar luminosity function can be fit with a theoretical model based on the press - schechter ( 1974 ) approximation , with reasonable assumptions about the relation between quasar luminosity and dark matter halo mass , and the duty cycle of quasar activity .",
    "haiman & hui ( 2000 ) and martini & weinberg ( 2000 ) further demonstrate that the duty cycle can be better constrained by fitting both the luminosity function and two - point correlation function of high - redshift quasars .",
    "faint quasars reside in less massive dark matter halos in this model .",
    "they represent less rare peaks in the density field , and are expected to evolve more slowly than are the bright quasars .",
    "the luminosity function in this paper covers only two magnitudes in luminosity , which is not enough to make a detailed comparison with these models .",
    "a deep high - redshift quasar survey is needed in order to constrain the faint end slope of the quasar luminosity function and to compare with theoretical models .",
    "observations of a @xmath279 quasar ( @xcite ) demonstrates that the universe is already highly ionized at @xmath280 , by either the uv ionizing radiation from quasars or from star - forming galaxies . assuming that the high - redshift quasar luminosity function has the same shape as at low redshift , madau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated that the uv ionizing photons from high - redshift quasars is not sufficient to keep the universe ionized at @xmath13 . in this paper , we have shown that the shape of the high - redshift quasar luminosity function is shallower than at low redshift for bright quasars , implying even fewer ionizing photons from the these quasars than assumed in madau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . however , the faint quasars might contribute more uv ionizing photons than do bright quasars at high redshift .",
    "we currently have no knowledge of the faint end slope of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , a deep quasar survey is also needed in order to determine the nature of high - redshift ionizing background .",
    "the sdss southern survey ( see paper iii ) will image the fall equatorial stripe ( the same area of the sky as the sample used in this paper ) 35  40 times in the five - year survey period .",
    "by co - adding these data , we will be able to select high - redshift quasar candidates down to @xmath281 at @xmath13 , and even fainter for low - redshift quasars . in paper iii , we present 18 quasars down to @xmath282 selected from areas that have been observed twice during the sdss commissioning .",
    "the high - redshift quasar luminosity function from the southern survey will reach @xmath283 , close to the traditional boundary between quasars and seyfert galaxies ( @xmath284 ) .",
