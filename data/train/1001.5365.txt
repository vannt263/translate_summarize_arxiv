    "the many - body ( mb ) level density @xmath0 is a fundamental quantity which describes basic properties of thermodynamical systems .",

    "however a statistical treatment is still possible when interactions are taken into account in a mean field approximation . for fermions ,",
    "two extreme regimes can be identified . at temperatures which are low compared to the fermi energy @xmath1 but high with respect to the mean level spacing at @xmath1 ( degenerate gas approximation ) , @xmath0 has a stretched exponential growth @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the excitation energy and @xmath4 is the smooth single - particle ( sp ) level density .",
    "nowadays bethe s theory still remains a basic ingredient for advanced mb theories like back - shifted fermi gas models @xcite and the gilbert - cameron model @xcite . from eq.([eq_bethe_formul ] ) , we see @xmath0 is essentially sensitive to the sp level density around the fermi energy .",
    "the second regime corresponds to high temperatures @xmath5 , where the classical limit is reached and where @xmath0 has a power - law behavior ( maxwell - boltzmann regime ) .",
    "the aim of the article is to analyze , for fermions , the transition between the two regimes ( see fig.[fig ] ) . to tackle this , we compute - in the degenerate gas limit - the effect of a finite number of particles when the temperature increases . for a power - law sp level density @xmath6",
    ", we find two contributions to @xmath0 : the first one is given by the usual sommerfeld expansion while the second one is related to low - lying level excitations .",

    "the last two equations define @xmath33 and @xmath34 . from eq.([eq_syst1_n ] ) , we see that @xmath26 must decrease from positive to negative values when the temperature increases . ignoring the discreteness of the sp level density , we now replace @xmath35 by a smooth function : @xmath36 for instance , the case @xmath37 is the leading order of the @xmath38-dimensional ho . the case of billiards",

    "in contrast to the stretched exponential growth at low temperature , we notice that the mb level density has a power - law behavior at high temperatures .",
    "in this section we compute exactly the mb level density for a system of non - interacting particles confined by a one - dimensional harmonic potential ( 1dho ) with unit frequency and make connections with number theory .",
    "we choose @xmath69 such that the spectrum is given by integers .",
    "we must compute the mb level density for a given integer excitation energy @xmath70 and for a given particle number @xmath8 , by counting all possible configurations of particles . a schematic way to depict this enumeration consists of using young diagrams .",
    "they form @xmath70 boxes with @xmath11 non - increasing lines such as : @xmath71 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the column number for the line @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , for an integer @xmath70 the number of young diagrams is the number of ways of counting @xmath70 as non - zero integers when the line number is less than @xmath8 .",
    "this number @xmath76 is the so - called _ partition function of @xmath70 restricted to at most @xmath8 terms_. + for each young diagram we associate a unique configuration of particles in such a way that the horizontal axis represents the excitation energy of the particle and the vertical axis represents the index of the occupied level .",
    "hence we have a one - to - one correspondence between each particle configuration and young diagrams ; @xmath76 is @xmath77 @xcite . in the same way one can",
    "easily shows that the result holds for particles with bose - einstein statistics as well .",
    "+ the theory of partitions is studied in profusion by mathematicians ( see @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "one of the most singular results comes from the works of hardy , ramanujan and rademacher who computed an analytical expression when the number of terms into @xmath76 is not restricted anymore @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath78 is called the _ partition number of an integer @xmath70_. the leading asymptotic expression of @xmath79 for large @xmath70 is given by @xmath80 to leading order the exponential term in eq.([eq_form_asymp ] ) is equivalent to eq.([eq_syst1_rho ] ) with eq.([eq_def_entrop33 ] ) and @xmath61 as expected . the correction term for a finite number of terms to @xmath76",

    "this distribution is the so - called gumbel - like , and is one of the universal distributions in the domain of extreme values statistics @xcite .",
    "it shows how the finite particle number contributes to the decrease of the number of configurations when heating the system ( increases @xmath70 ) and determines the transition from low- to high - temperature regime .",
    "the main target of the article is to evaluate this correction when the spectrum is no longer equidistant but fulfills the more general law eq.([eq_rho_power_law ] ) .",
    "this will be computed in the following section .",
    "note that in the case of fermions , the fermi energy depends on the particle number , while this is not the case for bosons .",
    "this fundamental difference implies that the equivalence between the two statistics is only valid in the case of the 1dho . in the context of the partition theory",
    "the generalization to a sp level density of the form eq.([eq_rho_power_law ] ) leads to map @xmath84 to the _ partition number of an integer @xmath85 into a sum of @xmath8 _ distinct ( due to pauli principle ) _ @xmath86-th powers of integers_. for bosons , a similar relation exits but without any distinction between summands @xcite .",
