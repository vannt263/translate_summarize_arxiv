    "a key observable statistic that describes the evolution of the galaxy population is the average sfr as a function of epoch and of galaxy stellar mass . over the last decade",
    ", much progress has been made towards delineating , and in part understanding , the relationship between star formation history and stellar mass .",
    "`` archaeological '' studies of present - day galaxies demonstrate a strong correlation between star formation history and present - day stellar mass in the sense that the bulk of stars now in massive galaxies must have formed at earlier epochs than stars now in less massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "surveys of cosmologically distant galaxies have revealed a related trend , often referred to as `` downsizing '' in that context .",
    "downsizing most commonly refers to the observation that intense star formation ( @xmath7 ) becomes increasingly limited to systems of lower and lower mass as redshift decreases @xcite .",
    "recently , this phenomenology has been recast in more quantitative terms through study of the specific sfr ( i.e. , sfr per unit stellar mass ) as a function of redshift , finding that at @xmath8 , low - mass galaxies appear to be forming stars at a higher rate per unit mass than their more massive cousins @xcite .",
    "there are two important parts of this empirical picture that require clarification .",
    "firstly , many studies use sfr indicators which are highly susceptible to dust extinction ( e.g. , [ oii ] or uv - optical sed - derived sfrs ; @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , all studies to date have relied on individual detections to allow sfr derivation .",
    "neglecting sfr contributions from galaxies with individually undetectable star formation tracers biases the census of sfr at all masses .",
    "however , the bias is especially severe at low masses where the sfr limiting sensitivity implies that all low - mass galaxies with individual sfr detections have extremely high specific sfr .    in this letter",
    ", we present an analysis of spitzer 24@xmath0 observations of two combo-17 fields designed to circumvent these two key limitations .",
    "we estimate sfr by combining indicators of obscured and unobscured star formation , and attempt to derive average sfrs through stacking of galaxy sub - samples with individually - undetected sfr indicators . in  2 , we summarize the data and galaxy samples . in  3 , we describe our sfr measurements . in  4 , we present the contribution of different bins in stellar mass to the cosmic sfr , and present the evolution of specific sfr with lookback time , again as a function of stellar mass .",
    "we discuss our results in  5 .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with h@xmath9=70kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11=0.3 and @xmath12=0.7 .",
    "the combo-17 survey @xcite has imaged three @xmath13 fields in five broad and 12 intermediate optical bands from 350 to 930 nm with the goal of deriving high - quality photometric redshifts at the median galaxy magnitude of @xmath14 @xcite . ] for @xmath15 galaxies with @xmath16mag in each field .",
    "the rest - frame luminosities in the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 band , and a synthetic uv2800 band centered at 280 nm have been derived for all combo-17 galaxies with photo - z s . by fitting the combo-17 multi - band photometry with a library of sed templates , @xcite estimated the galaxies stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath20 ) , and hence stellar mass for all @xmath16 galaxies based on a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ; such an imf has stellar masses similar to within 10% compared to those derived using a @xcite or @xcite imf ) . from these data , @xcite constructed stellar mass functions in four even redshift slices between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "two of three combo-17 fields , the extended chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) and the abell 901/902 ( a901 ) have been observed by the multiband imaging photometer on _ spitzer _ ( mips : @xcite ) at 24@xmath0 .",

    "owing to mismatches in depth between wide - area ir surveys ( i.e. , iras ) and well - characterized optical galaxy surveys ( i.e. , the sdss and 2dfgrs ) , it is challenging to produce an appropriate and well - defined local comparison sample .",
    "we have attempted to produce an adequate local control sample by collecting a sample of 2177 galaxies from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) with 2mass @xmath36-band magnitude @xmath37 in the volume of @xmath38 and galactic latitude @xmath39 . assuming a @xmath36-band @xmath20 of 0.6m@xmath33/l@xmath33 and a kroupa imf , stellar masses were derived from the @xmath36-band absolute magnitude .",

    "each sub - sample of galaxies defined by optical data contains individually - detected and individually - undetected objects at 24@xmath0 .",
    "following @xcite we estimated the total 24@xmath0 flux for the sub - sample of individually - undetected objects through stacking .",
    "the total 24@xmath0 flux of the sub - sample is then obtained by adding the individual fluxes from the detected objects and stacked flux from the individually - undetected objects .",
    "our sfr indicator , the total ir luminosity ( 8 - 1000@xmath0 ) , is extrapolated from the 24@xmath0 luminosity using three sets of local ir sed templates from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , we use stacking of ir - bright galaxies with @xmath59 at 70@xmath0 and 160@xmath0 to show that the average ir sed of an ir - bright galaxy is spanned by these local template sets , lending credibility to the total ir luminosity estimated here to within a factor of two .",
    "we use the bolometric luminosity produced by young stars ( uv+ir ) to estimate the sfr , a procedure that accounts for both obscured and unobscured star formation .",

    "the estimates of both sfrs and stellar masses are affected by systematic errors , that other studies have estimated to be @xmath64dex .",
    "these systematic uncertainties are not included in our error bars , but are substantially smaller than the dynamic range of the trends discussed in this letter . due to the combo-17 @xmath65-band selection ( @xmath16 ) , our sample galaxies are incomplete for low - mass bins at @xmath66 , where low - mass red galaxies with little blue radiation from newly - formed stars fail to make the @xmath65-band selection cut but low - mass blue galaxies containing more on - going star formation remain available for the selection .",

    "in the previous section , we have determined the average sfrs for galaxies split into stellar mass and redshift bins . in order to determine the contribution of different stellar mass bins to the cosmic ( average ) sfr , we must combine the average sfrs at a given mass with the space density of galaxies in that same mass range , as a function of redshift . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the stellar mass functions of @xcite for @xmath69 , and @xcite for @xmath41 , although the results are unaffected to within the uncertainties if we adopt stellar mass functions from , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite instead .",

    "our measurements of average sfr for galaxy subsets limited in mass and redshift account for contributions from both star - forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies in each subset .",
    "we find that the relative drop in sfr from @xmath80 to the present day is nearly identical for different sub - samples that span a range of @xmath1100 in stellar mass .",
    "that is , all galaxy samples , independent of mass , exhibit the same gradual decline of star formation ( and specific star - formation ) over the last 8 gyr .",
    "at all redshifts , we find that high - mass galaxies have substantially lower specific sfr than their low - mass cousins .    while many of the qualitative features of this paper have been understood for some time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this letter quantifies the relationships between specific sfr , galaxy stellar mass and redshift .",
    "` archaeological ' downsizing  that the stars in massive galaxies formed at earlier times than the stars in low - mass galaxies  is clearly recovered in this paper , in fig .",
    "on average , low - mass galaxies have specific sfrs capable of more than doubling their stellar mass over the hubble time ( at all redshifts ) , whereas galaxies with @xmath79m@xmath85 are not capable of such growth at @xmath86 from _ in situ _ star formation alone .",
    "arguably the most striking and new contribution of this letter is that the decline in sfr from @xmath80 to the present occurs at the same rate in galaxies of all masses .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been postulated to drive the demise of star formation since @xmath80 : agn feedback , the declining galaxy merger rate , gas consumption , changes in the availability of cooling or infalling fresh gas , and a host of other possibilities .",
    "we speculate that the declining supply of new gas falling in from the cosmic web at @xmath8 seems an attractive candidate for driving much of the phenomenology that we observe @xcite .",
    "the roughly constant rate of decline of sfr and ssfr for galaxies of widely differing masses is in contrast to the predictions of theoretical models in which cooling and hence star formation is quenched by heating due to radio - loud agn ( ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "this process is more important in more massive galaxies for two reasons .",
    "first , more massive galaxies are more likely to host massive black holes , and more massive black holes are generally assumed to be capable of producing more energy and stronger heating .",
    "second , it is generally assumed in such models that agn can only heat gas that is cooling from a quasi - hydrostatic hot halo , which form in large mass halos ( @xmath8710@xmath88m@xmath33 ) as opposed to the `` cold mode '' flows that are dominant in lower mass halos .",
    "for example , the models of @xcite predict a decline of a factor of @xmath18 from @xmath6 to the present , in the sfr contributed by galaxies more massive than @xmath89m@xmath33 ( see their figure 8) , while the sfr contributed by less massive galaxies declines by a factor of about 24 over this same interval .",
    "we find , using an independent model with radio - mode heating by agn ( somerville et al . in preparation ) , that the specific star formation rate in galaxies with stellar mass greater than @xmath57m@xmath33 has declined by a factor of @xmath115 since @xmath6 , while the specific sfr in the lower mass bins ( the same bins used here ) , declines by only a factor of 35 .",
    "the precise rate of decline of the sfr as a function of galaxy mass is no doubt sensitive to the details of the physics of star formation , but the prediction of a strongly differential ` quenching ' of star formation by agn feedback in the form of radio heating , as it is currently implemented , seems inevitable .",
    "our results therefore suggest that radio mode heating by agn is not the dominant mechanism responsible for the decrease in cosmic sfr from @xmath6 to the present .",
