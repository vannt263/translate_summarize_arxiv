    "this paper analyzes a _ qualitative aspect _ of the problem of robust utility maximization .",

    "@xmath4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] over all terminal wealths @xmath5 of admissible strategies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an underlying semimartingale .",
    "when @xmath3 is finite only on the positive half - line , the duality theory for this problem in the spirit of @xcite has been studied in both _ quantitative _ and _ qualitative _ aspects ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of utility taking finite values for all @xmath8 , @xcite shows the key duality , while @xcite and @xcite give a _ partial result _ on the existence of optimal strategy which we shall complete in this paper .",
    "see also @xcite for more comprehensive reference and the background of the robust utility maximization problem .",
    "a key subtlety intrinsic to the case of utility on @xmath9 is _ the `` good definition '' of admissible strategies @xmath6 _ , which will constitute the central theme of this paper . in this case",
    ", a universal and conceptually natural definition of admissibility is that @xmath10 is uniformly bounded from below by some constant , which completely determines the quantitative nature of the problem .",
    "this class , however , typically fails to admit an optimizer . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath3 is @xmath11 on @xmath12 , the only natural ( non - redundant ) definition of admissibility is that the stochastic integral @xmath10 is bounded from below by @xmath13 , and an optimal strategy is indeed obtained in this class under certain mild assumptions ( see @xcite ) .    in the classical case ( i.e. , @xmath14 , say ) , the question of the good definition of admissibility is closely analyzed by @xcite following the observation by @xcite and @xcite in the case of exponential utility .",
    "@xcite shows that a `` good definition '' which yields us an optimal strategy is that @xmath10 is a supermartingale under all local martingale measures @xmath15 which has a `` finite entropy '' with the physical probability @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the class of such @xmath6 by @xmath17 ( see section  [ sec : formulation ] for precise definitions including the meaning of `` finite entropy '' ) .",
    "note that this class contains the usual admissible class , and the supermartingale property is consistent to the `` no - arbitrage philosophy '' .",
    "thus @xmath17 is acceptably natural choice _ when a single physical probability is specified_.    in the general robust case with @xmath0 containing ( infinitely ) many elements , @xcite ( see also @xcite for a slight generalization ) provides a partial analogue of the above result which states that , under certain stronger assumptions , an optimal strategy is obtained in the class of @xmath6 with @xmath10 being a supermartingale under all local martingale measures @xmath15 having a finite entropy w.r.t . a certain element @xmath18 called a _",
    "least favorable measure _ ,",
    "i.e. , in the class @xmath19 . here",
    "a dissatisfaction comes of course from the dependence of admissibility on @xmath20 . in _ philosophy _ , @xmath0 is the set of _ candidates _ of real world models , and we do not know which one is true .",
    "thus an `` admissible strategy '' should be _ universally _",
    "admissible for all candidates @xmath1 . also , the least favorable probability @xmath20 is a part of solution to the dual problem of robust utility maximization , hence the class @xmath19 is not _ a priori _ available .    in this view ,",
    "a seemingly natural admissible class is @xmath21 which is universal and contains all @xmath6 whose stochastic integrals are bounded below .",
    "thus our central question in this paper is :    [ q : keyquestion ] does the class @xmath21 admit an optimal strategy ?",
    "the main result ( theorem  [ thm : mainthm1 ] ) states that this is indeed the case if ( in addition to standard assumptions ) the set @xmath0 of candidate models has a _ time - consistency _ property .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "the first step is to construct a so - called `` optimal claim '' for the abstract version of robust utility maximization , from which a candidate of optimal strategy @xmath22 is derived through a predictable representation argument .",
    "this part is mostly standard excepting some technicality , but we give a slightly better description of optimal claim . note that the additional time - consistency assumption is not required at this stage .",
    "the crucial step is to verify the supermartingale property of @xmath23 under all local martingale measures @xmath15 which has a finite entropy with _ some _",
