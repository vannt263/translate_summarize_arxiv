    "the identification of redshifted qso absorption line systems with @xmath4 , typically referred to as damped ly@xmath3 ( dla ) systems , is important because the dla absorbers are thought to be the progenitors of present day ordinary galaxies .",
    "the nature of these high neutral  column density systems is under debate . at high redshift ,",
    "study of the absorbers is made difficult by the dimness of the protogalactic systems , and much of the work is theoretical ( eg .",
    "prochaska & wolfe 1998 ; haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 1998 ) . at low redshift",
    "there are fewer absorbers known , and recent observations find a variety of host galaxy types , including amorphous low surface brightness galaxies as well as spirals and compact objects , ( eg . steidel et al .",
    "1995 ; le brun et al . 1997 ; bowen , tripp & jenkins 2001 ; turnshek et al .",
    "thus there is a need to identify more local , low and moderate redshift examples for detailed study .",
    "one way to identify these systems is to select low - redshift absorbers by the presence of another , more common , low - ionization absorption line such as the  @xmath5   doublet .",
    "the metal - line systems can then be observed in either the uv regime for dla absorption against qso s with sufficient uv flux ( eg .",
    "rao & turnshek 2000 ) , and/or in the radio for  21 cm absorption if the qso is also a radio source ( lane et al .",
    "2001 , in prep ) . unlike the saturated dla absorption feature",
    ", the 21 cm absorption profile can provide information about the velocity and temperature of the absorbing clouds ( eg .",
    "lane , briggs , & smette 2000 ; briggs , de bruyn , & vermeulen 2001 ) .",
    "the radio - emitting region in a qso is extended , so 21 cm observations at the appropriate angular resolution can also provide information on the spatial distribution of the absorbing gas by probing several sightlines to the background source . if the information on velocity structure and spatial distribution of the gas is combined , it is possible to construct a reasonable model of the intervening galaxy responsible for the absorption ( eg .",
    "briggs et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the opacity of the 21 cm line is inversely sensitive to the excitation or spin temperature , , of the gas ; lower  gas will create a more opaque absorption profile . under usual conditions in the multi - temperature - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way ,",
    "is coupled to the kinetic temperature , , of cold - phase gas @xcite , although the two temperatures begin to diverge in the case of warm - phase ism gas @xcite . as a result",
    ", the 21 cm line profile can be used to estimate the kinetic temperature of the cold neutral absorbing gas to which it is most sensitive .",
    "this can be done either by comparison to the temperature - insensitive dla absorption line in the same system , or by using the width of each individual component to set an upper limit to the kinetic temperature of the gas ( lane et al .",
    "2000 ; kanekar , ghosh , & chengalur 2001 ) .    currently , there are roughly 25 redshifted 21 cm absorbers known . of these roughly one - third",

    "the rest are systems which intervene along the sightline to a qso . in this paper",
    "we present high velocity resolution radio spectra for two new intervening low - redshift  21 cm absorbers identified in a recent survey ( lane 2000 ) .",
    "neither object has been observed for ly@xmath3 absorption , but we infer that both have column densities @xmath4 .",
    "the neutral column density contained in a 21 cm absorption line is computed by taking the integral over the absorption profile :    @xmath7    where  is the spin temperature of the absorbing gas , assumed to be constant for each cloud , and @xmath8 is the velocity in .",
    "@xmath9 is the optical depth of the line at velocity @xmath8 , and includes a factor @xmath10 to account for the fraction of the continuum source covered by the absorber .",
    "thermal broadening of an absorption feature provides an independent constraint on the kinetic temperature , @xmath11 , of the gas :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the full - width half max ( fwhm ) velocity for atomic hydrogen measured in .",
    "unfortunately , bulk kinematical motions and turbulence in the absorbing  gas will also broaden the absorption line , so this is not always a stringent constraint on the gas temperature .",
    "the 21 cm spectra were obtained on 1999 september 19 ( b 0248 + 430 ) and 2000 september 6 ( b 1243 - 072 ) using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) with uhf - high receivers and the dzb correlator . both observations were made as followups to previous and more tentative detections from an extensive 21 cm survey of absorbers by lane ( 2000 ) .    for b  0248 + 430 ,",
    "the total integration time was just under 4 hours .",
    "a bandwidth of 0.625 mhz centered at 1018.94 mhz is divided into 256 channels to provide a channel width of 2.44 khz .",
    "no on - line smoothing was applied , giving a velocity resolution of 0.86 .",
    "observations of 3c 48 were used to calibrate the flux density scale and the passband . for b  1243 - 072 ,",
    "the total integration time was roughly 9.5 hours .",
    "a bandwidth of 1.25 mhz and 128 channels centered at 988.6 mhz give a velocity resolution of 3.6 .",
