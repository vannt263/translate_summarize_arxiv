    "in recent years , high - cadence surveys and dedicated supernova ( sn ) searches have increased the discovery rate of unusual optical transients .",
    "examples of events with low peak luminosities ( @xmath3 ) and rapidly decaying light curves comprise sn  2005ek @xcite , sn  2010x @xcite and sn  2005e @xcite .",
    "these sne show diverse spectroscopic signatures ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) and thus their explanation may require a diversity of models .",
    "@xcite concluded that sn  2005ek represents the most extreme small ratio of ejecta to remnant mass observed for a core - collapse sn to date .",
    "two classes of models have been suggested to explain these fast and faint events .",
    "the first one proposes a partial explosion @xcite or the collapse of a white dwarf @xcite , both involving a very low ejecta mass .",
    "the second relates to hydrogen - free core - collapse sne with large amounts of fall back @xcite or with essentially no radioactive nickel @xcite .",
    "also the afterglows of short @xmath4ray bursts ( sgrbs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are suggested to originate from mergers of neutron stars ( nss ; e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are predicted theoretically to produce fast and faint `` kilonovae '' at optical / ir wavelengths powered by the ejection of @xmath5 of radioactive @xmath6-process material @xcite ",
    "see @xcite for detections of a possible candidate .",
    "these mergers constitute the prime candidate sources of high frequency gravitational waves to be detected by the ligo / virgo network within the next 5  yr @xcite , which fosters the search for their electromagnetic counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a good understanding of faint and fast transients is thus urgently needed .",
    "it is well - known that the outcome of stellar evolution in close binaries differs significantly from that of single stars .",
    "the main effects of mass loss / gain , and tidal forces at work , are changes in the stellar rotation rate , the nuclear burning scheme and the wind mass - loss rate @xcite . as a result",
    ", the binary interactions affect the final core mass prior to collapse @xcite , and therefore the type of compact remnant left behind and the amount of envelope mass ejected .",
    "whereas most type  ib / c sne are expected to originate in binary systems , from the initially more massive star which has been stripped of its hydrogen envelope by mass - transfer to its companion @xcite , these pre - sn stars typically have an envelope mass of @xmath7 or more @xcite .",
    "in a close x - ray binary , however , a second mass - transfer stage from a helium star to a ns can strip the helium star further prior to the sn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". the fast decay of the type  ic sn  1994i with an absolute magnitude of @xmath8 was explained by @xcite from such a model , and for which they suggested a resulting pre - sn carbon - oxygen star of @xmath9 and a corresponding ejecta mass of @xmath10 .",
    "the starting point of all these calculations ( tight systems containing a naked helium star and a ns with orbital period , @xmath11 ) is a continuation of the expected outcome of common envelope evolution ( ce ) in high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "of particular interest is mass transfer by roche - lobe overflow ( rlo ) initiated by the helium star expansion after core helium exhaustion ( so - called case  bb rlo ) .    here , we investigate sn progenitors originating from the evolution of such helium star ",
    "ns binaries , and find them to be the most promising candidates to achieve maximally stripped pre - sn cores .",
    "we provide a detailed example and demonstrate that this scenario can produce an iron core collapse of a small , bare core of @xmath12 , leading to an ejecta mass of only @xmath13 .",
    "in section  [ sec : binary_evol ] we present our model with computations extending beyond oxygen ignition , and study the final core structure prior to iron core collapse .",
    "we model light curves for the resulting fast and faint sn explosion and compare our results with sn  2005ek in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "finally , we estimate the rate of these events , discuss double ns binaries and summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "for our detailed calculations of the evolution of helium star  ns binaries , we applied the bec stellar evolution code ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; for recent applications to x - ray binaries and further description of case  bb rlo , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we assumed an initial helium star donor mass of @xmath14 , a ns mass of @xmath15 and orbital period , @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr ] shows the complete evolution of the helium star donor in the h - r  diagram . for the same model , we present the calculated mass - transfer rate , the kippenhahn diagram and the final chemical structure in figures  [ fig : mdot][fig : abundances ] .",
    "the points marked by letters along the evolutionary track in figure  [ fig : hr ] correspond to : a ) helium star zero - age main sequence ( @xmath17 ) ; b ) core helium exhaustion at @xmath18 , defining the bottom of the giant branch with shell helium burning ; c ) onset of case  bb rlo at @xmath19 ; d@xmath20 ) core carbon burning during @xmath21 , leading to radial contraction and roche - lobe detachment ( as a result of the mirror principle when the core expands ) ; d@xmath22 ) consecutive ignitions of carbon burning shells during @xmath23 and roche - lobe detachment again ; e ) maximum luminosity at @xmath24 ; f ) off - center ( @xmath25 ) ignition of oxygen burning at @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ; @xmath28 ) , marked by a bullet . shortly thereafter ( point g ) the binary orbit becomes dynamically unstable when @xmath29 and we took our model star out of the binary to continue its final evolution as an isolated star ( @xmath30 ) . at this stage @xmath31 .",
    "off - center oxygen burning ignites at @xmath32 and 34  yr thereafter our computer code breaks down ( see below ) .",
    "the evolution of our model is similar to those of @xcite ( cf .",
    "their fig .  6 ) , who calculated their binary stellar models until carbon burning .",
    "our model resembles also very well the cores of @xmath33 single stars which were found to lead to iron core collapse @xcite . from fig .",
    "4e of the latter work , we infer that our core is expected to undergo iron core collapse @xmath34 after our calculations were terminated .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot ] shows the mass - transfer rate , @xmath35 as a function of time .",
    "the total duration of the mass - transfer phases is seen to last for about @xmath36 ( excluding a couple of detached epochs ) , which causes the ns to accrete an amount @xmath37 , depending on the assumed accretion efficiency and the exact value of the eddington accretion limit , @xmath38 .",
    "here we assumed @xmath39 ( a typical value for accretion of helium rich matter ) and allowed for the actual accretion rate to be somewhere in the interval 30%100% of this value ( see recent discussion by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we note that the structure of the donor star is hardly affected by uncertainties in the ns accretion efficiency .",
    "the tiny helium burning layer causes the star to expand vigorously , approximately at the same time the convective shell penetrates to the surface ( cf .",
    "point  g ) , resulting in numerical problems for our code .",
    "we therefore end our calculations without resolving this flash which is , in any case , not important for the core structure and the ns accretion due to the little amount of mass in the inflated envelope .",
    "as discussed in detail by @xcite , the runaway mass transfer may lead to the onset of a ce evolution , where the final outcome is determined by the competition between the timescale for the onset of spiral - in and the remaining lifetime before gravitational collapse .",
    "in general , the duration of the ce and spiral - in phase is found to be @xmath40 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which is long compared to the estimated final life time of our model of about 10  yr @xcite .",
    "therefore , while our model may still lose even more helium , the naked star is expected to undergo iron core collapse and produce a sn  ic ( see section  [ subsec : lc ] for a discussion of the sn type ) .      in figures  [ fig : kippenhahn][fig : abundances ] we present the final chemical structure of our stellar model , whose final mass is @xmath41 .",
    "it consists of an almost naked metal core of @xmath42 which is covered by a helium - rich envelope of only @xmath43 .",
    "the kippenhahn diagram in figure  [ fig : kippenhahn ] shows the interior structure and evolution ( energy production and convection zones ) of the @xmath44 helium star which undergoes case  bb rlo , and later case  bbb rlo ( rlo re - initiated following shell carbon burning ) , and leaves behind a silicon - rich core . seven carbon burning shells follow the core carbon burning phase .",
    "oxygen ignites off - center ( near a mass coordinate of @xmath45 ) due to an inversion of the temperature profile produced by neutrino cooling in the inner core .",
    "the convection zone on top of the initial oxygen burning shell ( at @xmath46 ) reaches out to @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the final chemical structure of our model ( figure  [ fig : abundances ] ) consists of a thick omgsi outer core of @xmath48 , which is sandwiched by onemg - layers in the inner core ( @xmath49 ) and toward the envelope ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this is surrounded by a co - layer of @xmath51 and a helium - rich envelope of @xmath52 .",
    "the total amount of helium in this envelope is @xmath53 .",
    "helium star undergoing case  bb / bbb rlo in figures  [ fig : hr][fig : mdot ] .",
    "the plot shows cross - sections of the helium star in mass - coordinates from the center to the surface of the star , along the @xmath54-axis , as a function of stellar age on the @xmath55-axis .",
    "the value @xmath56 is the remaining time of our calculations , spanning a total time of @xmath57 .",
    "the green hatched areas denote zones with convection ; red color indicates semi - convection .",
    "the intensity of the blue / purple color indicates the net energy - production rate . shortly after off - centered oxygen ignition ( at @xmath25 , when @xmath58 ) we evolved the star further as an isolated star for @xmath59 until our code crashed , about 10  yr prior to core collapse . ]    the ultra - stripped nature of our model is achieved because the helium star is forced to lose ( almost ) its entire envelope in a very tight orbit where a ns can fit in .",
    "[ subsec : spectra ]    we modeled the sn light curve evolution based on the sn progenitor star presented in section  [ sec : binary_evol ] , with sn kinetic energy , nickel mass and mass cut as free parameters .",
    "the light curve calculations were performed by a one - dimensional multi - group radiation hydrodynamics code ` stella ` ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the obtained @xmath60-band light curves .",
    "we applied two mass cuts ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) to the progenitor star with a corresponding sn ejecta mass ( @xmath63 ) of @xmath64 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : lc ] , the calculation assuming a mass cut of @xmath61 , a nickel mass of @xmath65 and a sn explosion energy of @xmath66 agrees well with the extremely rapidly declining type  ic sn  2005ek @xcite .",
    "the multi - color light curve evolution of our model also matches that of sn  2005ek .",
    "these parameters are fairly consistent with those estimated by @xcite ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ) . as the rise time",
    "( @xmath70 , @xcite ) of sn  2005ek is not well - constrained by the observations , @xmath71 and @xmath72 remain uncertain and we expect some degeneracy in the light curve models",
    ". therefore , the set of parameters shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] for sn  2005ek may not be unique .",
    "recent modeling of synthetic sn spectra by @xcite suggests that more than @xmath73 of helium is needed for helium lines to become visible in optical / ir spectra .",
    "our final stellar model contains only @xmath53 of helium .",
    "this amount could be further reduced by mass transfer and winds , as well as by explosive helium burning during the sn explosion .",
    "therefore , the sn corresponding to our model is expected to be observed as a sn  ic , rather than a sn  ib .",
    "@xcite showed that the stellar radii of regular sne  ib / c progenitors in binary systems are generally larger for lower final masses .",
    "this is because the helium envelope expands farther for a more compact carbon - oxygen core during the evolutionary stages beyond core helium exhaustion .",
    "relatively low - mass progenitors of sne  ib / c with such extended envelopes will appear systematically more luminous than more massive sne  ib / c progenitors @xcite .",
    "however the ultra - stripped sn  ic progenitors considered in the present study have a very compact nature at the pre - sn stage despite their low final masses , due to the close proximity of the compact companion and the resultant tiny amount of helium left in the envelope .",
    "the final radius of about @xmath74 , bolometric luminosity of about @xmath75 and a corresponding high surface temperature of about @xmath76 , as predicted by our model ( figure  [ fig : hr ] ) , imply that they are visually faint ( @xmath77 ) , and it will be extremely difficult to identify them in pre - sn optical / ir images . depending on the column density of the accretion disk corona and the circumbinary material from the ejected envelope , along the line - of - sight to earth , these ultra - stripped systems may be bright x - ray sources prior to the sn .",
    "if the mass transfer ends before the core collapse , our stripped progenitor is not expected to develop an optically thick wind .",
    "therefore , the photosphere of the shock breakout will form near the hydrostatic stellar surface .",
    "the corresponding x - ray flash will have a harder energy spectrum , @xmath78 , and a shorter duration , @xmath79 ( e.g. according to recent simulations and analytical estimates by @xcite and @xcite ) , than in the case of regular sn  ib / c ( such as sn  2008d ) for which @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is because the progenitors of regular sne ib / c have either a larger radius or an optically thick wind , making the shock breakouts occur at relatively low temperatures .",
    "the expected rate of ultra - stripped sne  ic as discussed above can be estimated as follows .",
    "the evolution of a binary system must avoid a merger during the ce  phase which produces the helium star  ns binary , but the resulting orbit must be close enough such that the compact star is able to peel - off the helium shell during the mass transfer initiated by the helium star expansion .",
    "immediate descendants of such systems are close double ns binaries which eventually merge due to gravitational wave radiation . the merger rate of those in a milky  way - like galaxy is estimated to be between @xmath82 a  few  myr@xmath83 and up to @xmath84 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "compared to a total galactic sn rate of @xmath85  per  century , this would mean that only one in @xmath86  sne is of this kind .",
    "on the other hand , we have to include similar systems producing black hole  ns binaries and also add the number of systems ( a factor of a few ) which were disrupted as a consequence of the dynamical effects of the second sn explosion , and are therefore not contributing to the estimated merger rates quoted above .",
    "in addition , there are several other channels including a helium star and a relatively compact companion star that could also produce ultra - stripped sne  ic : ( 1 ) helium star ",
    "white dwarf binaries and ( 2 ) the progenitors of intermediate - mass / low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and binary millisecond pulsars , where the companion is a relatively compact main - sequence star .",
    "the binary pulsar psr  j1141@xmath26545 provides an example for the first of these evolutionary channels ( case  bb rlo would occur between stages  7 and 8 in fig .  1 , in",
    "the existence of a non - recycled ( and thereby short - lived ) pulsar in this system with @xmath87 suggests that the rate for this channel could be at least comparable to that of the double ns merger channel .",
    "the progenitors of lmxbs with @xmath88 are also potential systems producing , at least partly , stripped sne  ic .",
    "their birthrate is probably @xmath89 @xcite , but since the vast majority of these systems become disrupted in the sn ( i.e. before the observed lmxb phase ) , the rate for stripped sne  ic from this channel could be up to a factor of 10 higher .",
    "we note that the stripping effect is less certain for a giant helium star experiencing mass transfer to a low - mass main - sequence star and more research is needed to investigate this .    while it is difficult to estimate the rate of ultra - stripped sne  ic , these arguments taken together suggest that a realistic estimate of the ratio of ultra - stripped sne  ic to the total sn rate is likely to be in the range of @xmath90 .",
    "the extreme stripping producing the bare pre - sn core investigated here leads to an iron core - collapse sn with little ejecta mass , @xmath71 .",
    "it is expected that the ns left behind will have a gravitational mass in the range @xmath91 , depending on @xmath92 and the yet unknown equation - of - state ( eos ) of ns matter and its associated release of gravitational binding energy @xcite .",
    "these values are in accordance with the ns masses measured in some double ns systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "including the uncertainties in @xmath92 and the eos , the total range of ns birth masses produced in iron core - collapse sne may thus range from @xmath93 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the upper limit ) .",
    "the magnitude of any kick imparted to the newborn ns from an ultra - stripped iron core - collapse sn is uncertain .",
    "it may depend on , for example , @xmath92 ( and @xmath72 ) and thus on the timescale of the explosion compared to those of the non - radial hydrodynamic instabilities producing large kicks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a symmetric explosion , the post - sn eccentricity of our system will be @xmath94 , also in agreement with constraints obtained from some of the known double ns systems . in case",
    "our modeled pre - sn core had a slightly smaller mass , the outcome would have been an electron capture sn @xcite . in general , we conclude that an ultra - stripped core , following an evolution similar to the one presented here , is an evident sn  ic progenitor candidate of any second iron core - collapse or electron capture sn forming a close - orbit double ns system .",
    "the young radio pulsar psr  j0737@xmath23039b , in the double pulsar system @xcite , is an example of a ns which is most likely to have formed this way .",
    "we have shown that post - ce mass stripping in a helium star ",
    "ns binary can produce a sn progenitor with a total mass of only @xmath95 and an envelope mass of barely @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting iron core collapse of our example sequence leads to a type  ic sn with an ejecta mass in the range @xmath96 .",
    "we estimate that one in every 1001000 sne may be of this ultra - stripped type . through synthetic light curve calculations",
    ", we have demonstrated that sn  2005ek is a viable candidate for such an event .",
    "given the current ambitious observational efforts to search for peculiar and weak optical transients , it seems probable that more such ultra - stripped sn  ic with diminutive ejecta will be detected within the coming years .",
    "finally , we conclude that ultra - stripped cores are evident sn  ic progenitors of both iron core - collapse and electron capture sne producing the second ns in close - orbit double ns systems .                                                                                , p. 2001 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . 229 , evolution of binary and multiple star systems , ed .",
