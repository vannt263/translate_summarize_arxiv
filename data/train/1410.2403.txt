    "in recent years , cold atomic systems play a very important role for study of the condensed matter physics . in particular , the cold atomic system in an optical lattice ( ol ) @xcite is sometimes regarded as a feasible simulator searching for new type of quantum states .",
    "cold atomic systems in an ol are versatile and effects of defect and impurity are negligibly small . by the quantum simulators ,",
    "some important subjects have been studied including ; the strongly - correlated systems@xcite , lattice gauge theory@xcite and cosmology @xcite , etc .    from the above point of view , we are interested in the exotic quantum state in the cold atomic gases called a supersolid ( ss)@xcite , which has both a crystalline and a superfluid ( sf ) orders .",
    "while many interesting works on this subject@xcite have been reported for single - component cold atomic gases , the study on two - component boson systems is still inadequate . in the present paper",
    ", we shall study the bosonic t - j model ( b - t - j)@xcite with dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi)@xcite , as the long - range nature of the ddi possibly generates interesting phases including the ss .    to study the phase diagram in detail",
    ", we shall employ both the gutzwiller variational method and numerical quantum monte - carlo simulations ( qmc ) . to perform the qmc",
    ", we use the effective field - theory model of the b - t - j model derived in the previous paper@xcite .",
    "all relevant quantum fluctuations are included in the qmc of the effective model .",
    "the phase diagrams obtained by the above two methods are compared with each other and effects of the quantum fluctuations are discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the first subsection of sec.ii",
    ", we shall introduce the b - t - j model and briefly explain the derivation of the effective field theory . in the derivation",
    ", the hard - core constraint of the b - t - j model is faithfully treated by using the slave - particle representation . in the second subsection of sec.ii",
    ", we consider the ddi and introduce its effects into the b - t - j model . in the present paper",
    ", we consider the case in which dipoles of two - component boson are anti - parallel with each other . in this case , the ddi are nothing but the @xmath0-component pseudo - spin interactions",
    ". then we call the resultant mode extended b - t - j model . in sec.iii",
    ", we study the phase diagram by using the gutzwiller method , which is a kind of the mean - field approximation . in sec.iv ,",
    "the results obtained by means of the qmc are shown and discussed .",
    "the detailed investigation of the global phase diagram is given , in particular , states in the region of the competing orders of the solid and sf are discussed in detail . in sec.v , we introduce and study an anisotropic b - t - j model ( called b - t - j - like model ) , which was recently realized by the experiment@xcite . by the qmc",
    ", we show that the experimentally observation is reproduced in the model .",
    "section vi is devoted for conclusion .",
    "system of two - species bose gas in an optical lattice with the strong on - site repulsions is often described by the b - t - j model .",
    "its relationship to the bose - hubbard model was discussed in the previous papers . in the present paper , we regard the b - t - j model is a canonical model for the strong on - site repulsive bose - gas system .",
    "hamiltonian of the b - t - j model is given as follows@xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are boson creation operators@xcite at site @xmath5 , pseudo - spin operator is given as @xmath6 with @xmath7 and the pauli spin matrices @xmath8 , and @xmath9 stands for nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites of the lattice",
    ". we shall consider two dimensional square lattice in the following study .",
    "the first @xmath10-term of the hamiltonian ( [ htj ] ) is the hopping term of the @xmath11 and @xmath12-atoms , the second @xmath13-term represents the interaction between atoms at the nn sites , and the third @xmath14-term enhances the coherence of the relative phase of the @xmath11 and @xmath12-atomic fields . from the definition of the pauli matrix @xmath15 , it is obvious that @xmath13-term corresponds to a repulsive intra - species interaction and an attractive inter - species interaction for @xmath16 .",
    "physical hilbert space of the b - t - j model consists of states in which the total particle number at each site is strictly restricted to be less than unity . in order to incorporate this local constraint faithfully ,",
    "we use the following slave - particle representation@xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a boson operator that _ annihilates hole _ at site @xmath5 , whereas @xmath19 and @xmath20 are bosons that represent the pseudo - spin degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath21 is the physical state of the slave - particle hilbert space .",
    "the previous numerical study of the b - t - j model@xcite showed that there appear various phases including super - fluid ( sf ) with bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , state with the pseudo - spin long - range order , etc .",
    "for the most of the parameter regions , the qmc show that the density fluctuation of particles at each lattice site is stable even in the spatially inhomogeneous states like a phase - separated state . from this observation",
    ", we expect that there appears the following term effectively , @xmath22 where @xmath23 etc are the parameter that controls the densities of @xmath11-atom and @xmath12-atom at site @xmath5 , and @xmath24 controls their fluctuations around the mean values .",
    "it should be remarked here that the expectation value of the particle numbers in the physical state @xmath21 are given as @xmath25 and similarly @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the trace over the states satisfying the local constraint ( [ const ] ) .",
    "therefore the constraint ( [ const ] ) requires @xmath28 at each site @xmath5 .",
    "the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are to be determined in principle by @xmath31 and filling factor , but here we add @xmath32 to @xmath33 by hand and regard the parameter @xmath29 in @xmath32 as a free parameter , whereas @xmath30 are to be determined accurately by @xmath33 . in other words , we take the extended b - t - j model @xmath34 as a canonical model and regard @xmath32 as a residual one - site repulsion that can not be incorporated by the hard - core constraint .",
    "however , we expect that the original b - t - j model has a similar phase diagram to that of the extended b - t - j model .",
    "see later remarks on this point .    by means of the path - integral method ,",
    "the partition function @xmath35 is expressed as follows by introducing the imaginary time @xmath36 , @xmath37",
    "\\exp\\big[-\\int d\\tau\\big(\\bar{\\varphi}_{1i}(\\tau)\\partial_\\tau \\varphi_{1i}(\\tau ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{1 cm } + \\bar{\\varphi}_{2i}(\\tau)\\partial_\\tau \\varphi_{2i}(\\tau )   + \\bar{\\phi}_i(\\tau)\\partial_\\tau \\phi_i(\\tau )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{1 cm } + h_{\\rm tj}+h_{\\rm v } \\big)\\big ] , \\label{z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath32 are expressed by the slave particles ( [ slave ] ) and the above path integral is evaluated under the constraint ( [ const ] ) .",
    "the direct qmc is not applicable to the system ( [ z ] ) due to the berry phases @xmath38 etc , and therefore we separate the path - integral variables @xmath39 s and @xmath40 as @xmath41 and then integrate out the ( fluctuation of ) the radial degrees of freedom , @xmath42 . by the existence of the term @xmath32",
    ", the integration can be performed straightforwardly .",
    "there exists a constraint like @xmath43 on performing the path - integral over the radial degrees of freedom . but",
    "this constraint can be readily incorporated by using a lagrange multiplier @xmath44 , @xmath45 the variables @xmath42 also appear in @xmath33 , but we ignore them by simply replacing @xmath46 , and then we have @xmath47 where we have ignored the terms like @xmath48 by the periodic boundary condition for the imaginary time .",
    "the resultant quantity on the rhs of ( [ integral ] ) is positive definite , and therefore the numerical study by the qmc can be performed without any difficulty . it should be remarked that the lagrange multiplier @xmath49 in eq.([integral ] ) behaves as a gauge field , i.e. , the rhs of ( [ integral ] ) is invariant under the following  gauge transformation \" , @xmath50 . in the practical calculation , we shall show that all physical quantities are invariant under the above gauge transformation .    here",
    ", remarks are in order .    1 .",
    "the direct qmc of the system @xmath35 in eq.([z ] ) is impossible for the berry phases @xmath51 are pure imaginary .",
    "however by the integrating over the density fluctuations @xmath52 , the action becomes positive - definite as eq.([integral ] ) shows , and then the qmc is applied without any difficulty .",
    "2 .   in order to integrate over @xmath52",
    ", we have introduced the density - fluctuation term @xmath32 .",
    "effectively similar terms to @xmath32 are generated from the terms in the hamiltonian of the original b - t - j model ( [ htj ] ) .",
    "for example , a rough estimation for the density fluctuation of the @xmath11-atom @xmath53 gives , @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the mean value of the @xmath11-atom ( @xmath12-atom ) density , and the positive parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 are determined by the nn correlations of the phase degrees of freedom of the atomic fields like @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the phase of the @xmath11-atom field . in the qmc in sec.iv , we fix the values of @xmath10 and @xmath14 , and the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are determined by the b - t - j model ( [ htj ] ) quite accurately .",
    "it is difficult to obtain the coefficient in eq.([delrho ] ) accurately , but it is expected that coefficient of eq.([delrho ] ) is fairly stable against the variations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 as we require the constraint @xmath61(constant hole density ) in the calculation and also by the behavior of the correlators @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore for the system @xmath34 , we have verified by the practical calculation that a change of value of @xmath29 in @xmath32 does not substantially influence the global phase diagram of the system , although the sf region slightly increases for smaller @xmath29 as larger density fluctuation stabilizes the phase degrees of freedom by the density - phase uncertainty principle .",
    "see ref.@xcite , in particular , the left panels of figure 1 .",
    "then it is naturally expected that the obtained phase diagram of the constant @xmath29-system by the qmc faithfully describes the phase structure of the original b - t - j model as well as the extended b - t - j model with the @xmath32-term .",
    "the partition function obtained by performing the integral in eq.([integral ] ) depends on the local density of the bosons @xmath62 .",
    "we treat the density difference @xmath63 as a variational parameter _ while keeping one - site hole density fixed _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath64constant .",
    "these treatments obviously preclude the possibility a phase separated state .",
    "the previous study by means of a gross - pitaevskii equation and qmc@xcite shows that such a phase separated state does not appear in the b - t - j model ( [ htj ] ) .",
    "therefore this treatment is justified .",
    "the last remark concerns the hamiltonian ( [ htj ] ) itself .",
    "originally , the b - t - j model was derived as an effective model of the bose - hubbard model in the large on - site - repulsion limit . by integrating out the multiple - particle states at each site , the nn terms of the pseudo - spin interactions appear . at present , however , the interactions between atoms located at the nn sites can be generated and their strength is controlled by using the ddi . then the hamiltonian ( [ htj ] ) can be regarded as an original hamiltonian , and it is quite natural to add the hubbard term @xmath32 in eq.([hv ] ) to @xmath33 . in this case , the @xmath11 and @xmath12-atoms are not a hard - core boson and their density can take arbitrary values .",
    "effective model of the system is derived by a similar method to the above , but the use of the slave - particle representation is not needed .    as we explained in the introduction",
    ", we shall study bose gases with the ddi in this paper .",
    "in sec.iib , we briefly explain the ddi , which gives a long - range interaction between the @xmath0-component of the pseudo - spin @xmath65 .",
    "when the atoms have a magnetic or electric dipole , terms describing the ddi @xcite should be added to the b - t - j model hamiltonian .",
    "we first consider some specific case in which the @xmath11-atom has the upward dipole , whereas the @xmath12-atom has the downward one perpendicular to the ol .",
    "see fig.[ddisk ] .",
    "we regard this system as a canonical system and clarify its phase diagram in the subsequent sections .",
    "the system of the strongly - correlated dipolar gas , which was realized by the experiments recently , will be considered in sec.vi , because it has rather strong anisotropy in couplings .",
    "the ddi is generally given as @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 being the magnetic permeability of vacuum , @xmath69 the lande factor , and @xmath70 the bohr magneton ) , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) is dipole - moment vector of the @xmath73-th atom and @xmath74 with the relative position vector @xmath75 of the atoms . in the present canonical system ,",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 , and therefore the only the first term on the rhs of eq.([hd ] ) contributes . in fig.[ddisk ] , an experimental manipulation for realizing the canonical system is schematically shown ; first we prepare independently @xmath11-boson with up - polarized state and @xmath12-boson with down - polarized state in two magnetic traps .",
    "second , the ol is created in each trap . finally , we combine these two systems quasi - statically and lower the temperature . as a result of the strong repulsions between atoms and the finite hopping amplitude , the total particle number at each site of the ol is less than unity .",
    "furthermore , due to the angular - momentum conservation , direction of the dipole does not change under the hopping of atoms .",
    "though the ddi has long - range nature , we shall consider only the nn coupling and the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) coupling in the ol . in the present dipole configuration",
    ", the ddi reduces an inter - species attraction and intra - species repulsion .",
    "then @xmath78 in eq.([hd ] ) effectively generates the following terms @xmath79 where @xmath80 etc , and we have used @xmath81 , and @xmath82 stands for nnn sites .",
    "the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 are given by the overlap integral of the lowest level wannier functions ( s - wave ) on the ol sites .",
    "the @xmath85 term in eq.([vddi ] ) is to be added to the hamiltonian of the b - t - j model . in the following studies",
    ", we shall consider the system described by @xmath86 .",
    "mean - field theory ( mft ) is widely used to study phase diagram of condensed matter systems . in this section ,",
    "we employ the gutzwiller variational method , which is a kind of the mft , to investigate the phase diagram of the system @xmath87 at vanishing temperature ( @xmath88 ) . from the results of the previous studies@xcite",
    ", we expect the appearance of two kinds of solid order , i.e. , checkerboard - solid ( cbso ) and stripe - solid ( sso ) orders in certain parameter regions .",
    "the solid order is a spatial pattern of the atomic densities and is noting but a pseudo - spin order in the b - t - j model as @xmath89 is given by @xmath81 .",
    "as the present model describes the strong on - site repulsion limit , the physical state at each site consists of the following three state : @xmath90 ( single @xmath11-boson ) , @xmath91 ( single @xmath12-boson ) and @xmath92 ( empty = hole ) . by using the above three basis vectors",

    "is increased from @xmath180 , several small peaks appear in @xmath157 till @xmath181 .",
    "snapshots are quite useful to understand what happens in that region .",
    "see fig.[hetero ] , in particular , the snapshot of @xmath177 .",
    "small regions of the cbso and sso coexist there in the phase - separated form , and we verified that the spatial pattern of these small regions is rather stable under the mc updates .",
    "our observation indicates that there exist several ( meta)stable ` mixed crystals ' of the cbso and sso between the cbss and sso , and this mixing of the solid order destroys the sf .",
    "for the two - dimensional @xmath182-@xmath183 heisenberg model , it was expected that a quantum spin liquid exists between the nel state and the stripe antiferromagnetic state@xcite .",
    "the ddi in eq.([vddi ] ) has a similar structure to the above @xmath182-@xmath183 heisenberg model , but we think the present ` mixed crystals ' is different from the quantum liquid as the spatial pattern is stable . this is a result of the ising - type spin coupling of @xmath85 in contrast to the o(3 ) symmetric one in the @xmath182-@xmath183 heisenberg model .",
    "nowadays , it is possible to apply an artificial external magnetic field to the atomic system in an ol by rotating the system or using lasers@xcite .",

    "therefore they are one of the most interesting subjects in the cold atomic physics . in this section",

    "we expect that the stability depends on the type of the solid order of the ss s .    .",

    "however , the solid orders are stable against the magnetic field .",
    ", width=340 ]    in the practical calculation , we used the symmetric gauge for the vector potential . magnetic flux per plaquette of the ol",
    "is denoted by @xmath185 . in fig.[sssinm ] , we show the specific heat as a function of the strength of the magnetic field @xmath184 . for the cbss , the sf",

    "this result means that the sss is more robust than the cbss as it is expected from the phase diagram in fig.[pd ] .",
    "in this section we focus on the experiment of a.de paz et al.@xcite .",
    "they succeeded to create the nnn pseudo - spin interactions by using the ddi of @xmath188cr with total spin @xmath189 . in the experiment ,",
    "the doubly - occupied states were excluded by the strong on - site repulsion .",
    "furthermore by applying an external magnetic field , the two states with spin component @xmath190 and @xmath191 in the direction of the magnetic field dominate the system .",
    "then the reduced ddi is regarded as a pseudo - spin interaction similar to that of the t - j model .",
    "the resultant atomic system of @xmath188cr is a strongly - correlated system and is well described by the b - t - j model .",
    "however as shown by the calculation in ref.@xcite , the resultant b - t - j model has anisotropy in both the hopping amplitudes and pseudo - spin interactions .",
    "then we call the model _",
    "t - j - like model _ hereafter .",
    "we carried out detailed study of the t - j - like model by the qmc and obtained the phase structure of the t - j - like model in the parameter regime realized in the experiment .",
    "the effective action eq.([zeff ] ) changes to the following one by the anisotropy , @xmath192 where @xmath193 and the anisotropic couplings @xmath194 and @xmath195 are given as @xmath196 @xmath197 with @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the bohr magneton and @xmath68 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum as before .",
    "the proposed t - j - like model in ref.@xcite has an additional effective zeeman coupling along @xmath65 , but we ignore it in the present study because we are interested in the genuine effect of the ddi .    for the practical calculation , we regard the @xmath200 as a free parameter and put the hole density @xmath201 .",
    "the strength of the dipole - induced pseudo - spin interaction relative to the hopping amplitude @xmath10 determines the equilibrium state .    in the experiment ,",
    "it was observed that there exists a density difference between the @xmath202 and @xmath203 states in the equilibrium , and this phenomenon was considered as a result of the ddi .    , @xmath145 .",

    "the obtained specific heat exhibits the existence of a second - order phase transition at @xmath207 .",
    "we also calculated the density - difference correlation function ( ddcf ) @xmath208 defined by eq.([crfs ] ) . from the ddcf shown in fig.[c_t - j - like ] , it is obvious that @xmath209 as @xmath210 for @xmath211 , i.e. , the density of one atom is globally larger than that of the other for @xmath212 , whereas the equal density distribution is realized for @xmath213 .",
    "this is the direct result of the dipolar intersite spin interaction , and is in agreement with the experimental observation .",
    "density snapshots for @xmath212 and @xmath213 are shown in fig.[c_t - j - like ] .",
    "no specific spatial pattern is observed in contrast to the previous case that is studied in sec.iv .",
    "in this paper , we studied the extended b - t - j model of the two - component bosons with the long - range ddi .",
    "we show the ddi can generate the additional pseudo - spin interactions by controlling directions of the dipoles of the @xmath11 and @xmath12-atoms .",
    "we studied the global phase diagram of the extended b - t - model by means of the gutzwiller variational method and the qmc .",
    "obtained phase diagrams indicate that quantum fluctuation is an essential ingredient for the realization of the ss s .",
    "the qmc predicts two kinds of the ss state , one of which is the cbss and the other is the sss , and the latter stems from the long - range nature of the ddi .",
    "detailed study of the phase boundary of the cbss and sso was also given .",
    "finally we investigated the t - j - like model , which is expected to describe the strongly - correlated system recently realized by the experiment@xcite . by the qmc , we confirmed the existence of the phase transition as the strength of the ddi is increased . in the state with the ddi stronger than the critical one , an imbalance of the density of atoms , which is nothing but a finite pseudo - spin order in the @xmath0-direction , appears .",
