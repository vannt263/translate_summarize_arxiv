    "we study point particles in 2 + 1 dimensions using spatial geometries analogous to those in @xcite .",
    "these geometries are isomorphic to a gauge - reduced holonomy - flux phase space which descends from the @xmath0 limit of a loop quantum gravity hilbert space .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian written in terms of frame - field and connection variables . the spacetime signature is taken to be euclidean since the relevant gauge group is then @xmath1 , as in 3 + 1 dimensions with lorentzian signature .",
    "our first step is to specify the variables over an entire spacelike slice using a triangulation where particles sit on the vertices .",

    "it is well - known that in 2 + 1 dimensions point particles represent conical singularities @xcite .",
    "we introduce particles by replacing the flatness constraint with @xmath17 so that each particle @xmath18 gives a contribution to the curvature proportional to its momentum @xmath19 at the location @xmath20 @xcite . in this treatment the particles",
