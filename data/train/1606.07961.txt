    "the large-@xmath0 asymptotic expansions of the hankel functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the bessel functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the modified bessel functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 have a long and rich history . the earliest known attempt to obtain an asymptotic expansion",
    "is that of poisson @xcite in 1823 where the special case of @xmath7 with @xmath8 being positive was considered .",
    "he derived the first few terms of an asymptotic expansion based on the differential equation satisfied by @xmath7 , but investigated neither the coefficients nor the remainder term .",
    "the first complete asymptotic expansion for @xmath7 , with a formula for the general term , was given by hamilton @xcite in 1843 .",
    "a similar ( formal ) analysis of @xmath9 is due to hansen @xcite from 1843 .",
    "the complete asymptotic expansion of @xmath10 for arbitrary integer order was first given by jacobi @xcite in 1849 .",
    "a rigorous treatment of poisson s expansion was provided by lipschitz @xcite in 1859 with the aid of contour integration ; here jacobi s result was also studied briefly .",
    "the general asymptotic expansions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with a fixed complex @xmath11 and large complex @xmath0 , were obtained ( rigorously ) by hankel @xcite in his memoir written in 1868 .",
    "he also gave the corresponding expansions of the hankel functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the modified bessel function @xmath5 was established by kummer @xcite in 1837 ; this result was reproduced , with the addition of the corresponding formula for @xmath6 , by kirchhoff @xcite in 1854 .",
    "estimates for the remainder terms of the asymptotic expansions of the hankel and bessel functions have been obtained by several authors in the past one and half century .",
    "we mention the works of schlfli @xcite from 1875 , watson @xcite from 1922 and meijer @xcite from 1932 , where the methods used were based on integral representations . a different approach to the problem , using differential equation techniques , was taken by weber @xcite in 1890 and much later , in 1964 , by olver @xcite . for a more detailed historical account ,",
    "the reader is referred to watson s monumental treatise on the theory of bessel functions @xcite .    in this paper , we reconsider the large - argument asymptotic expansions of the hankel , bessel and modified bessel functions , and the corresponding results for their derivatives . in modern notation , the expansions for the hankel functions , bessel functions , and that of their derivatives may be written @xmath12 @xmath13 as @xmath14 in the sector @xmath15 ; @xmath16 @xmath17 as @xmath14 in the sector @xmath18 ; @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 as @xmath14 in the sector @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being an arbitrary small ( fixed ) positive constant and @xmath25 ( see , e.g. , @xcite and  10.17(ii ) ) )",
    ". the branch of the square root in these expansions is determined by @xmath26 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are polynomials in @xmath29 of degree @xmath30 ; their explicit forms are as follows : @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 ( with the empty products interpreted as @xmath35 ) .",
    "the expansions , , and are due to hankel .",
    "the results established by poisson , hansen and jacobi are all special cases of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "if @xmath36 equals an odd integer , then the right - hand sides of  terminate and represent the corresponding function exactly .",
    "the analogous expansions for the modified bessel functions and their derivatives are @xmath37 @xmath38 as @xmath14 in the sector @xmath39 ; and @xmath40 @xmath41 as @xmath14 in the sectors @xmath42 , with @xmath24 being an arbitrary small ( fixed ) positive constant ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ) .",
    "as before , the square roots are determined by @xmath26 .",
    "the original result of kirchhoff omits the second component of the asymptotic expansion , which is permitted if we restrict @xmath0 to the smaller sector @xmath43 .",
    "( in this sector , the second component is exponentially small compared to any of the terms in the first component for large @xmath0 and is therefore negligible . )",
    "the same observation applies for .",
    "the expansions  terminate and are exact when @xmath36 equals an odd integer .",
    "it is important to note that these asymptotic expansions are not uniform with respect to @xmath11 ; we have to require @xmath44 in order to satisfy poincar s definition .",
    "there exist other types of large-@xmath0 expansions which are valid under the weaker condition @xmath45 ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) ; however these expansions do not lend themselves to treatment with our methods .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to derive new error bounds for the asymptotic expansions  and their re - expanded versions .",
    "due to the various relations between the hankel and bessel functions , it is enough to study the remainder terms of the asymptotic expansions , , and ( see appendix [ appendixa ] for more details ) .",
    "thus , for any non - negative integers @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we write @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 throughout this paper , if not stated otherwise , empty sums are taken to be zero .",
    "the derivations of the estimates for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are based on new integral representations of these remainder terms . in expressing these new integral representations",
    ", we shall employ the following notation ( @xmath58 ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 were originally introduced by dingle @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and p. 415 ) and , following his convention , we refer to them as basic terminants ( but note that dingle s notation slightly differs from ours , e.g. , @xmath63 is used for our @xmath64 ) .",
    "these basic terminants are multivalued functions of their argument @xmath65 and , when the argument is fixed , are entire functions of their order @xmath66 .",
    "we shall also use the concept of the regularized hypergeometric function @xmath67 which is defined by the power series expansion @xmath68 for @xmath69 and by analytic continuation elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 of this function can take arbitrary complex values .",

    "* and 10.29.e1 ) ) .",
    "it was shown by boyd @xcite that for any non - negative integer @xmath46 , the remainder term @xmath52 can be expressed as @xmath90 provided that @xmath80 and @xmath76 .",
    "this representation of @xmath52 is the central tool in boyd s asymptotic analysis of the modified bessel function @xmath5 , in particular , in the derivation of his bounds for @xmath52 . in the following two theorems , we present results for the remainders @xmath73 , @xmath53 and @xmath91 analogous to . in our analysis ,",
