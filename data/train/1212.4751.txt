    "we find two attracting critical fixed points at specific values of market imbalance and understand fluctuations around them . by considering different functions for the feedback",
    ", we find large fluctuations with consecutive melting and coarsening periods , or alternatively small fluctuations with critical lattice states , both leading to long range correlations and striped states .    in order to connect the market model to the social systems perspective",

    "these systems exhibit an abrupt phase transition ( with a jump in the order parameter ) , however , show critical divergences @xcite .",

    "future work could quantify the behavior near the fixed points by performing langevin simulations and using probabilities for striped states in a coarsening process started with correlated lattice states .",
    "while the focus of this article is the limit of a regular 2d lattice , it would be interesting to introduce a number of shortcut links between pairs of randomly chosen agents .",
