    "systems of ultrasmall tunnel junctions composed of metallic or superconducting electrodes have attracted considerable interest owing to the significant roles of the coulomb interaction in them .",
    "first of all , a sufficiently large charging energy leads to the coulomb blockade effect which exhibits single charge ( electron or cooper pair ) tunneling  @xcite . in order for this tunneling to occur , however , it should be energetically favorable with respect to the electrostatic energy of the system .",
    "otherwise , more complex elementary processes that involve several charge - tunneling events become dominant . in particular , a recent theoretical prediction  @xcite and an experimental demonstration  @xcite have revealed the _ cotunneling _ of electron - hole pairs in two one - dimensional ( 1d ) metallic tunnel - junction arrays coupled by large inter - array capacitances ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "such cotunneling of electron - hole pairs results in the remarkable effect of current drag : the current fed through either of the chains induces a secondary current in the other chain .",
    "the primary and the secondary currents are comparable in magnitude , but opposite in direction .    a similar current drag effect has also been observed in a slightly different configuration of the system , in which each electrode in one array is coupled aslant to two adjacent electrodes in the other array ( slanted coupling ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] )  @xcite . unlike the case mentioned above ( straight coupling",
    "; see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , where the low - energy state can be preserved only if the electron and the hole tunnel simultaneously ( cotunneling ) , in this case the low - energy state can be preserved for sequential tunneling of the electron and the hole .",
    "it has been suggested that this correlated sequential tunneling might be more likely than the second - order process of cotunneling via a quantum - mechanical virtual state .",
    "more interestingly , when the tunneling junctions are composed of ultrasmall superconducting grains , the counter part of the electron - hole pair becomes the pair of an excess and a deficit cooper pair , which will be simply called a particle - hole pair .",
    "furthermore , in such ultrasmall josephson - junction systems , the competition between the charging energy and the josephson coupling energy is well known to bring about the noble effects of quantum fluctuations  @xcite . in a previous work  @xcite , it was proposed that , combined with these quantum - fluctuation effects , the cotunneling of particle - hole pairs in capacitively coupled 1d josephson junction arrays ( jjas ) drives the insulator - to - superfluid transition of the pairs  @xcite .    in this paper , the previous work  @xcite on two",
    "capacitively coupled 1d jjas is extended to consider both straight and slanted couplings .",
    "the focus will be on the similarities and differences between the two coupling schemes .",
    "it is shown that on long - time and long - length scales , the two cases are indistinguishable ; as the coupling capacitance increases , both of them exhibits berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt)-type insulator - to - superfluid transition , whose superfluid phase is uniquely characterized by the condensation of particle - hole pairs and by perfect drag of supercurrents along the two chains .",
    "the correlated tunneling nature of the elementary process in the slanted case is reflected by its lower transition point .",
    "capacitively coupled jjas can presumably be realized in experiment , even by current techniques .",
    "recent advances in microfabrication techniques have already made it possible to create large arrays of ultrasmall josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the experimental realization of the capacitively coupled submicron metal - junction arrays  @xcite illustrates that large interarray capacitances can also be fabricated between two jjas . in passing ,",
    "capacitive coupling should be distinguished from josephson coupling ( allowing interarray cooper - pair tunneling ) .",
    "the quantum - fluctuation effects in the latter case , as in the case of quantum josephson ladders , have been studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , the models for the systems with straight or slanted couplings and the regions of interest in parameter space are defined .",
    "section [ sec:2dvg ] is devoted to the transformation of the models into equivalent 2d systems of classical vortices . in section [ sec : sigma ] , the conductivity of the system is examined in the vortex representation . the results from sections [ sec:2dvg ] and [ sec : sigma ]",
    "provide the bases of this work on which the phase transition and the current - drag effect are discussed in section [ sec : qpt ] .",
    "section [ sec : qpt ] constitutes the main part of this paper and present a thorough discussion of the role of particle - hole pairs in the quantum - phase transition and the transport in the system .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "each of the two chains ( @xmath0 ) of josephson junctions considered here is characterized by the josephson coupling energy @xmath1 and the charging energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 associated with the self - capacitance @xmath4 and the junction capacitance @xmath5 , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the two chains are coupled with each other by the capacitance @xmath6 , with which the electrostatic energy @xmath7 is associated .",
    "two different ways of coupling are considered : each island in one array is coupled one - to - one to one island ( straight coupling ; fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) or aslant to two islands ( slanted coupling ; fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) in the other array .",
    "there is no cooper - pair tunneling between the chains .",
    "the intra - chain capacitances are assumed to be so small ( @xmath8 ) that , without the coupling , both chains would each be in the insulating phase  @xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that the coupling capacitance is sufficiently large compared with the intra - array capacitances : @xmath9 . in that case , the electrostatic energy of the particle - hole pair ( @xmath10 ) is much smaller than that of an unpaired charge ( @xmath11 ) . for the most part",
    ", this work is devoted to the case of identical chains , but non - identical chains will also be briefly discussed .    in the specified region of parameter space ,",
    "the time scale of the relevant dynamics is determined by the coupling capacitance ( @xmath6 ) and the corresponding josephson plasma frequency ( @xmath12 ) . to be explicit , for straight coupling , it is convenient to rescale the capacitances by @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , the energies by @xmath15 , and the times by @xmath16 . for slanted coupling , on the other hand ,",
