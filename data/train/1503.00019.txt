    "lvy processes form a rich field within mathematical finance .",
    "they allow modelling of asset prices with possibly discontinuous dynamics .",
    "an early and probably the best known model involving a lvy process is the @xcite model , which generalises the @xcite model .",
    "more recently , we have seen more complex models allowing for more general dynamics of the asset price .",
    "examples of such models include the @xcite model ( see also @xcite ) , the normal inverse gaussian model ( @xcite ) , the variance gamma model ( @xcite ) , and the carr - geman - madan - yor ( cgmy ) model ( @xcite ) . for a good exposition on jump processes in finance",
    "we refer to @xcite ( also see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "prices of european options whose underlying asset is driven by the lvy process are solutions to partial integro - differential equations ( pides ) ( @xcite ) that generalise the black - scholes equation by incorporating a non - local integral term to account for the discontinuities in the asset price .",
    "this approach has also been extended to cases where the option price features path dependence , for instance in @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lvy -khintchine formula provides an explicit representation of the characteristic function of a lvy process ( cf , @xcite ) . as a consequence",
    ", one can derive an exact expression for the fourier transform of the solution of the relevant pide . using the inverse",
    "fast fourier transform ( ifft ) method , one may efficiently compute the option price for a range of asset prices simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , in the case of european call options , one may use the duality property presented by @xcite and ifft to efficiently compute option prices for a wide range of strike prices .    despite the popularity of fourier methods for option pricing",
    ", few works can be found on the error analysis and related parameter selection for these methods .",
    "a bound for the error not only provides an interval for the precise value of the option , but also suggests a method to select the parameters of the numerical method .",
    "an important work in this direction is the one by @xcite in which several payoff functions are considered for a rather general set of models , whose characteristic function is assumed to be known .",
    "@xcite presents the framework and theoretical approach for the error analysis , and establishes polynomial convergence rates for approximations of the option prices . for a more contemporary review on the error committed in various ft - related methods",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , that extends the classical _ flat _ fourier methods by deforming the integration countours on the complex plane , studying discretely monitored barrier options studied in @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present a methodology for studying and bounding the error committed when using ft methods to compute option prices .",
    "we also provide a systematic way of choosing the parameters of the numerical method , in a way that minimises the strict error bound , thus guaranteeing adherence to a pre - described error tolerance .",
    "we focus on exponential lvy processes that may be of either diffusive or pure jump .",
    "our contribution is to derive a strict error bound for a fourier transform method when pricing options under risk - neutral lvy dynamics .",
    "we derive a simplified bound that separates the contributions of the payoff and of the process in an easily processed and extensible product form that is independent of the asymptotic behaviour of the option price at extreme prices and at strike parameters .",
    "we also provide a proof for the existence of optimal parameters of the numerical computation that minimise the presented error bound .",
    "when comparing our work with lee s work we find that lee s work is more general than ours in that he studies a wider range of processes , on the other hand , our results apply to a larger class of payoffs . on test examples of practical relevance , we also find that the bound presented produces comparable or better results than the ones previously presented in the literature , with acceptable computational cost .",
    "the paper is organised in the following sections : in section [ section : method ] we introduce the pide setting in the context of risk - neutral asset pricing ; we show the fourier representation of the relevant pide for asset pricing with lvy processes and use that representation for derivative pricing . in section [ section : bound ] we derive a representation for the numerical error and divide it into quadrature and cutoff contributions .",
    "we also describe the methodology for choosing numerical parameters to obtain minimal error bounds for the ft method .",
    "the derivation is supported by numerical examples using relevant test cases with both diffusive and pure - jump lvy processes in section [ section : numerics ] .",

    "last , we note that since we do our analysis for pides on a mesh of @xmath61 s , one may also compute the option values in one go and obtain the greeks with little additional effort using a finite difference approach for the derivatives .",

    "as an example , for the particular case of the merton model , we have that any finite value of @xmath108 will do .",
    "however , this improvement of the rate of spectral convergence is more than compensated for by the divergence in the constant term .",
    "the integrals in and can , in some cases , be computed analytically , or bounded from above by a closed form expression .",
    "consider for instance dissipative models with finite jump intensity .",
    "these models are characterised by @xmath156 and @xmath170 .",
    "thus the integrals can be expressed in terms of the cumulative normal distribution @xmath249 : @xmath250    now we consider the case of pure - jump processes ( ie , @xmath251 ) that satisfy the condition @xmath252 for some @xmath157 . in this case",

    "consider the two following auxiliary bounds for the same integral , in which @xmath259 : @xmath260    @xmath261    we have that @xmath262 , defined as the minimum of the right hand sides of the two previous equations , @xmath263 is a bound for the integral . bearing this in mind we have @xmath264 and",

    "we gauge the tightness of the bound compared to the true error using both dissipative and pure - jump processes .",
    "we also demonstrate the feasibility of using the expression of the bound as a tool for choosing numerical parameters for the fourier inversion .",
    "the variance gamma model provides a test case to evaluate the bound in the pure - jump setting .",
    "we note that of the two numerical examples presented , it is the less regular one in the sense that @xmath266 and @xmath267 for @xmath268 , indicating that theorem [ teo : boundm ] in particular is not applicable .",
    "the lvy measure of the vg model is given by : @xmath269 and the corresponding characteristic function is given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) of @xcite : @xmath270    by proposition [ prop : analy1 ] we get that @xmath271 which , combined with the requirement that @xmath272 ( cf , remark [ remark : callput ] ) , implies : @xmath273 for calls and puts , respectively .",
    "we note that evaluation of the integral in is possible also for @xmath274 and for @xmath275 .",
    "in fact , there is a correspondence between shifts in the integration countour and put - call parity .",
    "integrals with @xmath194 give rise to put option prices instead of calls . for an extended discussion of this , we refer to @xcite or @xcite , in which conformal deformation of the integration contour is exploited in order to achieve improved numerical accuracy .    in @xcite and in our calculations the parameters equal @xmath276 , @xmath277 and @xmath278 .     the true error and the error bound for evaluating at the money options for the vg model test case . ]",
    "table [ tb : usvslee ] presents the specific parameters and compares the bound for the vg model with the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "based on the table , we note that for the vg model presented in @xcite we can achieve comparable or better error bounds when compared to the study by lee .",
    "to evaluate the bound , we perform the integration of and by relying on the clenshaw - curtis quadrature method provided in the scipy package . to supplement table [ tb : usvslee ] for a wide range of @xmath80 , we present the magnitude of the bound compared to the true error in figure [ fig : vgerrvsbound ] .    in figure [",
    "fig : vgerrvsbound ] , we see that the choice of numerical parameters for the fourier inversion has a strong influence on the error of the numerical method .",
    "one does not in general have access to the true solution .",
    "thus , the parameters need to be optimised with respect to the bound . recall that @xmath279 and @xmath280 denote the true and estimated errors , respectively .",
    "keeping the number of quadrature points @xmath80 fixed , we let @xmath281 and @xmath282 denote the minimisers of the estimated and true errors , respectively @xmath283 we further let @xmath284 and @xmath285 denote the true error as a function of the parameters minimising the estimated and the true error , respectively @xmath286 in figure [ fig : vgerrvsbound ] we see that the true error increases by approximately an order of magnitude when optimising to the bound instead of to the true error , translating into a two - fold difference in the number of quadrature points needed for a given tolerance .",
    "the difference between @xmath287 and the bound is approximately another order of magnitude and necessitates another two - fold number of quadrature points compared to the theoretical minimum .    in figure",
    "[ fig : parameterplot ] , we present the true error and @xmath85 such that the level of accuracy is of the order @xmath288 . ] for the fourier method for the two test cases in table [ tb : usvslee ] .",
    "we note that while minimising error bounds will produce sub - optimal results , the numerical parameters that minimise the bound are a good approximation of the true optimal parameters .",
    "this , of course , is a consequence of the error bound having qualitatively similar behaviour as the true error , especially as one gets further away from the true optimal parameters .    in practice ,",
    "the hardy norm in coefficient @xmath242 reduces to evaluating an @xmath58 norm along the two boundaries of the strip of width @xmath83 .",
    "we find that , for practical purposes , the performance of the clenshaw - curtis quadrature of the quadpack library provided by scipy library is more than adequate , enabling the evaluation of the bound in a fraction of a second .    for example , the evaluations of the bounds in table [ tb : usvslee ] take only around @xmath289 seconds to evaluate on mid 2014 macbook pro equipped with a 2.6 ghz intel core i5 processor , this without attempting to optimize or parallelize the implementation and while checking for input sanity factors such as the evaluation of the characteristic function in a domain that is a subset in the permitted strip .",
    "we believe that through optimizing routines , skipping sanity checks for inputs and using a lower - level computation routines this can be optimized even further , guaranteeing a fast performance even when numerous evaluations are needed .    .[tb : usvslee]the error bound for european call / put options in the vg model for select examples .",
    "refererence result @xmath290 from @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for contrast with the pure - jump process presented above , we also test the performance of the bound for kou model and present relevant results in [ tb : usvsleekou ] .",
    "this model differs from the first example not only by being dissipative but also in regularity , in the sense that the maximal width of the domain @xmath291 is , for the case at hand , considerably narrower .",
    "the lvy measure in the kou model is given by @xmath292 with @xmath293 .",
    "for the characterisation given in @xcite the values are set as @xmath294 from the expression of the characteristic exponent ( see @xcite ) @xmath295 it is straightforward to see @xmath296 this range is considerably narrower than that considered earlier . in the case of transforming the option prices in strike space ,",
    "the relevant expressions for option prices as well as the error bounds contain a factor exponential in @xmath67 .",
    "the practical implication of this is that for deep out of the money calls , it is often beneficial to exploit the put - call - parity and to compute deep in the money calls .",
    "however , in the case at hand , the strip width does not permit such luxury . as a consequence ,",
    "the parameters that minimize the bound are near - identical through a wide range of moneyness , suggesting use of fft algorithm to evaluate the option prices at once for a range of strikes .      for the particular case of merton model , the lvy measure is given by @xmath297 and the characteristic exponent correspondingly by @xmath298 we may employ a fast semi - closed form evaluation of the relevant integrals instead of resorting to quadrature methods . we choose the merton model as an example of bounding the error of the numerical method for such a model .",
    "the parameters are adopted from the estimated parameters for s&p 500 index from @xcite : @xmath299    in figure [ fig : mertonplot ] , we present the bound and true error for the merton model to demonstrate the bound on another dissipative model .",
    "the option presented is a binary option with finite support on @xmath300 $ ] ; no damping was needed or used .",
    "we note that like in the case of the pure - jump module presented above , our bound reproduces the qualitative behaviour of the true error .",
    "the configuration resulting from optimising the bound is a good approximation of the true error .",
    "such behaviour is consistent through the range of @xmath80 of the most practical relevance .      in subsection [ ss :",
    "bounds ] explicit expressions to bound @xmath75 are provided . to evaluate these bounds",
    "it is necessary to compute @xmath246 and @xmath301 . according to remark [ rem : decuople ] ,",
    "once we compute these values we could use them for any model , provided that they satisfy the conditions considered there .",
    "the payoff of perhaps the most practical relevance is that of a call option .",
    "consider @xmath21 defined by : @xmath302 for which a selection of a damping parameter @xmath303 is necessary to have the damped payoff in @xmath191 and to ensure the existence of a fourier transformation . in this case",
    "we have@xmath304 and @xmath305 it is easy to see that the previous expression decreases as @xmath306 increase .",

    "of the three roots of the derivative , only the one characterised by @xmath314 is a local maximum , giving us that for call options @xmath315 } { \\left| { { \\hat{{g_{{\\alpha}}}}}(0,\\rho ) } \\right| }   \\label{eq : complexsup}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , observe that @xmath316 is a differentiable real function of @xmath312 , whose derivative is given by the following polynomial of second degree : @xmath317 we conclude that @xmath318 where @xmath319 is the set of no more than four elements consisting of @xmath108 ; @xmath320 ; and the real roots of @xmath219 that fall in @xmath321 .",
    "so far , we have assumed the number of quadrature points @xmath80 to be constant . in real life applications , however , this is often not the case .",
    "typically the user might want to choose a minimal @xmath80 that is sufficient to guarantee error that lies within a pre - defined error tolerance .",
    "in such a case , we propose the following , very simplistic scheme for optimising numerical parameters and choosing the appropriate @xmath80 to satisfy error smaller than @xmath168 :    1 .",
    "select @xmath322 and optimize to find the relevant configuration 2 .",
    "see if @xmath323 , if not , increase @xmath80 by choosing it from a pre - determined increasing sequence @xmath324 and repeat procedure .    especially in using fft algorithms to evaluate the fourier transforms , we propose @xmath325 .",
    "we further note that typically the optimal configuration for the optimizing configuration for @xmath326 quadrature points does not differ too dramatically from the configuration that optimizes bounds for @xmath327 .",
    "we have presented a decomposition of the error committed in the numerical evaluation of the inverse fourier transform needed in asset pricing for exponential lvy models into truncation and quadrature errors . for a wide class of exponential lvy models ,",
    "we have presented an @xmath328-bound for the error .    the error bound differs from the earlier work presented in @xcite in the sense that it does not rely on the asymptotic behaviour of the option payoff at extreme strikes or option prices , allowing pricing a wide variety of non - standard payoff functions such as the ones in @xcite .",
    "the bound , however , does not take into account path - dependent options .",
    "we argue that the error for the methods that allow evaluating american , bermudan , or knockoff options are considerably more cumbersome and produce significantly larger errors so that in implementations where performance is important , such as calibration , using american option pricing methods for european options is not justified .",
    "the bound also provides a general framework in which the truncation error is evaluated using a quadrature method that remains invariant regardless of the asymptotic behaviour of the option price function .",
    "the structure of the bound allows for a modular implementation that decomposes the error components arising from the dynamics of the system and the payoff into a product form for a large class of models , including all dissipative models . on select examples ,",
    "we also demonstrate the performance that is comparable or superior to the relevant points of comparison .    we have focused on the minimization of the bound as a proxy for minimizing numerical error . doing this",
    ", one obtains , for a given parametrization of a model , a rigorous @xmath328 bound for the error committed in solving the european option price .",
    "we have shown that the bound reproduces the qualitative behaviour of the actual error .",
    "this supports the argument for selecting numerical parameters in a way that minimizes the bound , giving evidence that this selection will , besides guaranteeing numerical precision , be close to the actual minimizing configuration that is not often achievable at an acceptable computational cost .",
    "the bound can be used in the primitive setting of establishing a strict error bound for the numerical estimation of option prices for a given set of physical and numerical parameters or as a part of a numerical scheme , whereby the end user wishes to estimate an option price either on a single point or in a domain up to a predetermined error tolerance .    in the future ,",
    "the error bounds presented can be used in efforts requiring multiple evaluations of fourier transformations .",
    "examples of such applications include multi - dimensional fourier transformations , possibly in sparse tensor grids , as well as time - stepping algorithms for american and bermudan options .",
    "such applications are sensitive towards the error bound being used , as any numerical scheme will be required to run multiple times , either in high dimension or for multiple time steps ( or both ) .",
