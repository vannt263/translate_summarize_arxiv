    "the coupling of dynamical systems can lead to the synchronization of their outputs @xcite . recently",
    ", attention has been given to the a peculiar phenomenon introduced by voss @xcite where one system synchronizes not with the present state but with some future state of another system .",
    "this regime , called _ anticipated synchronization _",
    ", has been demonstrated theoretically and numerically in disparate dynamical systems including discrete or continuous , chaotic and noisy excitable , and quasi - periodic ones @xcite .",
    "experimental results have considered either electronic circuit implementations of the dynamical equations @xcite or lasers running in the chaotic regime both in one - directional @xcite and bidirectional coupling @xcite .    from the viewpoint of an external observer ,",
    "the dynamics of anticipated synchronization can be seen as if one system is forecasting the state of the other .",
    "it is unclear , however , under which general conditions a given dynamical system would or not exhibit such dynamics .",
    "the phenomenon in itself is rather counterintuitive because , depending on the setting , mixes notions of synchrony and order with the dynamics of chaos and disorder .",
    "furthermore , it is not immediately apparent whether or not nonlinearities are essential for the process .",
    "this paper is dedicated to answer these concerns , by analyzing the minimal setup able to exhibit the more fundamental aspects of this phenomena .",
    "the paper offers three perspectives covering from the simplest scenario to the more complex ones .",
    "section  ii is a brief overview of anticipated synchronization as described in recent work .",
    "section  iii discusses a toy model describing the trivial situation of two `` particles '' moving with uniform trajectory in which one attempts to closely follow the other using the scheme described in the anticipated synchronization literature .",
    "these particles can be seen as an special case of the dynamical system presented in section  iv , where the case of two coupled maps is analyzed from a dynamical systems perspective and the condition for anticipated synchronization derived analytically .",
    "the same system is revisited in section  v , but now from a control systems point of view , both for continuous and discrete cases .",
    "the paper closes by listing the most relevant conditions one would expect to see in all cases of anticipated synchronization .",
    "two different schemes have been proposed in order to achieve anticipated synchronization @xcite .",
    "both schemes use , in a way or another , delay lines which allow forecasting of a _ master _",
    "trajectory by a _ slave",
    "_ identical system .",
    "the first scheme uses the technique of _ complete replacement_. it considers a dynamical system , @xmath0 ( known as the _ master system _ ) whose dynamics involves a delayed feedback of the form : @xmath1 being @xmath2 a constant , and @xmath3 a given , generally non  linear , function .",
    "the dynamics of the _ slave system _ , @xmath4 , is obtained by a similar equation in which the delay term has been completely replaced by the master system .",
    "namely , the evolution equation for @xmath4 is : @xmath5 it is easy to see that the manifold @xmath6 , in which the slave anticipates by a time @xmath7 the actual output of the master , is a stable solution of the dynamical equations ( [ cr1]-[cr2 ] ) .",
    "this follows readily from the ( exact ) evolution equation @xmath8 for the delayed difference @xmath9 .",
    "this result is independent of both the function @xmath10 under consideration , or the arbitrarily large delay time @xmath7 .",
    "the structural stability of the asymptotic solution has been demonstrated by implementation in electronic circuits @xcite .",
    "of course , the result is more remarkable when the dynamics of the master has a high degree of unpredictability , _",
    "i.e. _ by choosing @xmath10 and @xmath7 such that the dynamics of the master is chaotic . in this scheme , and beyond the mathematical result , the anticipation mechanism can be understood from the fact that the dynamics of the master at time @xmath11 influences its own dynamics at a time @xmath7 later , whereas it enters the dynamics of the slave immediately at time @xmath11 . in other words , it is as if the slave system @xmath4 has _ anticipated knowledge _ of an essential part of the dynamics of the master system @xmath0 .",
    "the second scheme is one that includes only delay in the slave dynamics @xcite .",
    "this is defined by the following dynamical equations for the master and slave systems : @xmath12 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is an arbitrary function and @xmath14 is a coupling strength matrix .",
    "it is easy to show that the anticipated synchronization manifold is again a solution of this set of equations . at variance with the case of complete replacement",
    ", its stability can only be fulfilled in a limited range of parameters for @xmath7 and @xmath15 . despite this restriction , however ,",
    "we believe that this method of anticipated synchronization deserves more attention than that of complete replacement because the anticipation time @xmath7 is included as an external parameter and does not influence the dynamics of the master system . therefore , in principle , any dynamical system can be predicted by using this scheme .",
    "again , the anticipation is more relevant when the dynamics of the master is unpredictable by other simple means .",
    "recently an extension of the scheme was introduced to include anticipation in non  autonomous systems @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been considered the following set of equations : @xmath16 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the new term @xmath17 represents an external input acting on both , master and slave , systems .",
    "although the anticipated manifold is no longer an _ exact _ solution of the previous equations ( except in the case of a periodic forcing @xmath18 ) , it has been shown that several features of the dynamics of the master can indeed be predicted by the slave .",
    "for instance , it is possible to predict the peaks fired by an excitable system subjected to a random external forcing @xcite .",
    "we stress that in this case the random forcing induces peak firing at uncorrelated and unpredictable times .    in this second scheme ,",
    "( [ scheme1]-[scheme2 ] ) , the actual mechanism leading to synchronization is much more elusive and , despite the wide variety of work , it is still unclear which are the relevant conditions and requirements for two dynamical systems to exhibit this type of anticipated synchronization .",
    "for instance , one would like to understand whether or not nonlinear aspects of the dynamics are needed for the systems to exhibit anticipated synchronization . in the same line to what extent anticipation",
    "can be arbitrarily long is of relevance for practical purposes .",
    "the intention in this section is to undress the anticipated synchronization models of irrelevant aspects , to be able to identify the essential mechanisms at play .",
    "the goal is to have a system homologous to the more general ones described in the anticipated synchronization literature .",
    "we first look at the simplest linear one , thus we choose a dynamical system of two particles moving uniformly in a one - dimensional space .",
    "we consider a particle following a uniform motion @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the position of the particle at time @xmath11 and @xmath21 its velocity . following the scheme in anticipated synchronization to forecast ( and `` synchronize '' with ) the position of the master particle we consider another ( `` slave '' ) particle whose trajectory is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the strength of the coupling between the master particle ( eq .  ( [ m ] ) ) and the slave ( eq . ( [ s ] ) ) . to achieve the anticipation , the solution @xmath24 has to be a stable solution .",
    "the stability can be studied analyzing the behavior of the delayed difference @xmath25 .",
    "we obtain @xmath26 the condition for local stability of the solution @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is given by @xcite @xmath29 this indicates that in order to observe an anticipated solution of the slave particle within this scheme , the product of the coupling with the anticipation time @xmath7 has to be smaller than a certain value .",
    "larger values produce an over - correction and the slave is unable to anticipate .",
    "this expression qualitatively reproduces the numerical results obtained by several researchers .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the two systems are not identical , e.g. , the velocities are different , then @xmath30 then we obtain the same stability condition .",
    "however the anticipation is not perfect in the sense that the slave anticipates with a constant mismatch .",
    "the mismatch decreases with increasing coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "more generally one could obtain a stability equation of the from @xmath31 leading to the conditions @xcite @xmath32 or , @xmath33 where the principal value is taken ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "let us consider the same two particles of the previous section but now moving with the more general dynamics given by the following coupled maps : @xmath35 where @xmath2 and @xmath36 are constants .",
    "if @xmath37 the @xmath38 form a chaotic map , whereas @xmath39 leads to a quasi - periodic map and for @xmath40 the map converges to .",
    "the necessary @xmath41 initial conditions are the set @xmath42 .",
    "we are interested in the possibility of the coupled maps leading to anticipated synchronization , _ i.e. _ in having @xmath43 as an asymptotic solution for the maps . to this end",
    ", we consider the map satisfied by the delayed difference @xmath44 : @xmath45 an analysis complementary to ours can be found in @xcite .",
    "the ansatz @xmath46 leads to @xmath47 the ( complex ) constants @xmath48 are determined by the initial conditions .",
    "the @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the solutions of the polynomial equation : @xmath51 a necessary and sufficient condition for anticipated synchronization to hold and to be asymptotically stable is that @xmath52 , or equivalently @xmath53 .",
    "we analyze now the range of validity of this condition as a function of the parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it turns out that anticipated synchronization occurs if @xmath57 , where the value of @xmath58 depends on @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we consider three cases :    * 1.- * @xmath40 .",
    "we treat for completeness this case , although it is the less interesting from the practical point of view , since the maps tend asymptotically to a fix point ( in practise , after a finite number of steps ) .",
    "although a full analytical solution does not seem to be available in this case , it is possible to obtain the asymptotic behavior in the case of large anticipation @xmath55 : @xmath59 notice that anticipation is possible for arbitrarily large @xmath55 .",
    "* 2.- * @xmath39 . in this case , the dynamics is quasi - periodic .",
    "the interval of anticipated synchronization can be found analytically as : @xmath60 in the limit @xmath61 , @xmath62 , the same as the continuous case considered in the previous section .",
    "again , anticipation is possible for arbitrarily large @xmath55 .",
    "let us now analyze the predictability of the map , taking @xmath70 , @xmath71 , for which the synchronization limits are @xmath72 .",
    "first , for visualization purposes , we transform the output of the master map into a series of random spikes by defining a new  firing \" sequence @xmath73 as @xmath74 if @xmath75 and @xmath76 if @xmath77 , with @xmath78 a convenient threshold value . similarly for the slave map , we define @xmath79 if @xmath80 and @xmath81 if @xmath82 . in the case of @xmath70",
    "the timing of the pulses does not have any regularity .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsk ] , the power spectrum of the @xmath73 signal is flat , showing the absence of any preferred time scale , the series is highly unpredictable .    in fig .",
    "[ figukvk ] we show that , in accordance with the previous analysis , each pulse of the master system @xmath73 is anticipated @xmath71 units of time by a pulse in the slave system @xmath83 for a coupling @xmath84 ( middle panel ) . for too large or too small values of the coupling @xmath56 , the synchronization is lost .",
    "the existence of a minimum and maximum value for the coupling in order to have anticipated synchronization , which appears here as a property of simple linear maps , has also been observed in more complex chaotic @xcite and excitable non - autonomous systems @xcite .",
    "these maps can be seen as well as a case of integrate and fire dynamics , often used as caricatures of neural systems .",
    "from an engineer viewpoint , the slave dynamical system following a master , shown in the previous section , is seen as a cascade of control system blocks . in this section anticipated synchronization",
    "is analyzed from this control system perspective . in both , the continuous and discrete time systems ,",
    "@xmath85 will be seen as the output of a first order open loop system with no feedback , and the slave @xmath86 ( controlled signal ) represents the output of an identical system but with delayed time feedback and driven by the master system @xmath0 ( the reference signal ) . with enough loop gain in the feedback loop",
    ", the control will act as a servo mechanism which minimizes the error between the reference ( master @xmath0 ) and its own delayed output @xmath87 .",
    "hence , the internal variable @xmath86 will be a _ prediction _ of @xmath0 .",
    "the example of the two particles following each other described by equations ( [ m ] ) and ( [ s ] ) can be seem as a servo mechanism where the position of the controlled particle @xmath88 is compared with a reference signal @xmath20 .",
    "the integrator nature of the loop provides enough gain so that in steady state the error will vanish and the two signals will match .    equation ( [ m ] ) represents a pure integrator to input @xmath21 .",
    "denoting by @xmath89 the laplace transform of @xmath20 and assuming zero initial conditions for @xmath90 , the laplace transform of @xmath91 will be @xmath92 .",
    "also , since the constant velocity @xmath21 is represented as an external step input , its laplace transform @xmath93 will be equal to @xmath94 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath95 this represents a transfer function , in the laplace domain , with a pole at the origin of the @xmath96 plane .",
    "if @xmath21 is constant the output is a ramp @xmath97 .    repeating the same process for eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) we can write @xmath98 from where we obtain @xmath99 applying the inverse laplace transform to eq .",
    "( [ ss3 ] ) we can obtain the temporal evolution of the output for any given input .",
    "the dynamics of the error in the servo mechanism can also be obtain by subtracting @xmath100    the input / output relation , ( _ transfer function _ in control system terms ) , between @xmath89 and @xmath101 is given by the ratio of these two functions ( considering zero external input ) : @xmath102 equations ( [ ss1])([ss4 ] ) can be represented in a block diagram , as in fig .",
    "[ figgs ] , with direct gain @xmath103 and feedback gain @xmath104 . in more general terms , the closed loop transfer function is given by @xmath105    it follows that if the loop gain @xmath106 , the closed loop transfer function will be given by the feedback term @xmath107 .",
    "for our example this means that @xmath108 , and applying the inverse laplace transform @xmath109 .",
    "this was the expected result that proves that the delayed position of the second particle , after some transient , will follow the position of the first one .",
    "likewise , @xmath110 will be moving ahead of @xmath20 in a predictive manner .    to perform a stability analysis ,",
    "the roots of the denominator @xmath111 must be found .",
    "if we replace @xmath96 by @xmath112 a frequency analysis can be obtained .",
    "this is usually done drawing real and imaginary parts of the transfer function with the nyquist diagram or using the bode plots , representing module and phase separately .",
    "the term @xmath113 has a gain whose module decreases with @xmath114 and becomes unity for @xmath115 , and a constant phase equal to @xmath116 .",

    "substituting @xmath115 the total phase contribution @xmath125 at the unity gain point should be smaller than @xmath123 , recovering eq .",
    "( [ taomax ] ) @xmath126      a discrete system similar to the coupled maps described by eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) ( but without the @xmath127 constrain ) can be seen , in engineering terms , as a discrete time control systems written as two difference equations : one for the master @xmath38 and the other for the slave @xmath128 .",
