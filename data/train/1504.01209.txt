    "when water is confined between two large hydrophobic surfaces , one finds the emergence of a surprisingly long ranged effective attraction between the two hydrophobes .",
    "the attractive force grows exponentially as the distance between the surfaces is lowered .",
    "this exponential separation dependence of hydrophobic attraction has become widely known as the _ hydrophobic force law_.    the first direct measurement of the interaction between two cylindrically curved hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous electrolyte solutions was performed by israelachvili in a series of landmark experiments using specially designed surface force measurement apparatus .",
    "@xcite these experiments observed that the attractive force between the surfaces is `` long - ranged ''  being detectable even as far as separation .",
    "it is neither sensitive to the type and concentration of the electrolyte , nor to the ph of the solution .",
    "@xcite the hydrophobic force @xmath0 measured in experiments can be empirically fitted to the following form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the radius of the cylindrical curve , @xmath3 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath4 is the correlation length ( or , decay length ) .",
    "accurate estimate of the range of this hydrophobic force went through a period of uncertainty .",
    "different experimental force - measuring techniques and different methods of hydrophobization apparently recognized substantial diversity in length scales .",
    "there are reports of a measurable attractive force at separation as large as .",
    "@xcite however , recent experiments have led to believe that the attraction at separations greater than @xmath5 is due to a variety of system - dependent , nonhydrophobic ( or only indirectly hydrophobic - dependent ) effects .",
    "@xcite the attractive forces at separations less than @xmath6 represents the truly hydrophobic interaction",
    ". the exponential decay of the attractive force between hydrophobic surfaces ( or , the hydrophobic force law ) , however , remains an integral feature of all experimental results .    despite a great deal of research over the last three decades , understanding of certain aspects of the origin and nature of interaction between hydrophobic surfaces",
    "have remained unsatisfactory .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that size of the hydrophobic surface , degree of hydrophobicity and temperature together determine the critical separation  @xcite as well as the rate of evaporation of confined water .",
    "@xcite the phenomenon is mainly attributed to the formation of a liquid - vapor interface induced by the surface , leading to cavitation at some critical intersurface separation .",
    "@xcite such cavitation is also observed near vapor - liquid coexistence for a lennard - jones fluid confined between hard walls .",
    "@xcite this de - wetting induced collapse is generally described by density fields . in this context , lum - chandler - weeks ( lcw ) theory  @xcite has been one of the most successful approaches .",
    "it involves the drying interface concept , and includes effects of orientation of the water molecules only implicitly in the hamiltonian using prior knowledge of the radial distribution function .",
    "lcw theory predicts a critical intersurface separation of for two parallel hard plates .",
    "the above picture basically describes water in terms of inward propagating density inhomogeneity originating from the two surfaces .",
    "however , orientational ordering induced by the surfaces is ignored .",
    "indeed , as early as in 1959 , kauzmann introduced the concept of `` clathrate - structure '' of water surrounding the hydrophobic solutes to understand the hydrophobic effect in terms of entropic stability .",
    "@xcite formation of such structures emphasizes the role of orientational ordering in water .",
    "subsequent computer simulations have also found evidence of significant orientational ordering among water molecules around hydrophobic residues of protein molecules .",
    "@xcite in a recent study , berry and coworkers have discussed how oppositely directed polarization from water dipoles can give rise to a long range attraction .",
    "@xcite    in view of the above , the one - order - parameter ( density ) description of lum _ et al .",
    "_ may not be adequate to describe ordering of water around a hydrophobic surface .",
    "hydrophobic surfaces can induce orientational inhomogeneity by disrupting the natural orientational correlation among water molecules .",
    "this orientational ordering in turn may alter many fundamental properties of water , including density .",
    "it is thus expected to play a key role in describing the metastable or unstable state , if any , between the two hydrophobic surfaces .",
    "comprehensive understanding of the long range hydrophobic attraction is a challenging task , particularly because of subtle nature of the hydrophobic effect itself and its interplay with an array of other forces .",
    "computational approaches have proved to be very useful in this regard as one can explore the microscopic details and try to understand their manifestation in the macroscopic behavior .",
    "accurate and detailed models evidently gives improved accuracy in computer simulations .",
    "however , simplified models often give insights that are not obtainable at relevant time scales from complex models .",
    "they usually capture the essence of underlying physics while being more comprehensible  providing insights and illuminating concepts , and they do not require big computer resources .",
    "in the present work , we employ the mercedes benz ( mb ) model of water to study hydrophobic force law .",
    "this model was introduced by ben - naim  @xcite , and later parameterized by dill and co - workers to mimic water - like properties .",
    "@xcite the merit of this model lies in the simple form of the interaction potential and the reduced dimensionality . a schematic representation of the model is shown in fig .",

    "the interparticle axis vector is denoted by @xmath11 and the angles that the closest arm of each particle make with the axis vector are labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 . ]    several previous studies have demonstrated that mb model generally reproduces most of the properties of water including the density anomaly , the minimum in isothermal compressibility as a function of temperature , and the thermodynamic properties of nonpolar solvation .",
    "this model has also been used to study the thermodynamic properties and structural aspects of confined water .",
    "@xcite to study the hydrophobic force , we have introduced rigid parallel hydrophobic rods made of non - interacting 2d lennard - jones ( lj ) circles in mb water .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in nvt ensemble to investigate the structure and dynamics of the system .",
    "we find that this model system exhibits a clear attractive hydrophobic force law , with a correlation length @xmath4 of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the diameter of the mb circle .",
    "the force is found to decay to of the contact value at around @xmath16 .",
    "our results and analysis provide a molecular level explanation of the origin of long - range attractive forces between the two hydrophobic surfaces , prior to the eventual cavitation induced collapse .",
    "we introduced and calculated appropriate orientational order parameters .",
    "we find that the correlation length of density heterogeneity is significantly shorter than that of the bond orientational order parameter , while the latter is comparable to the correlation length of the hydrophobic force .",
    "destructive interference between orientational heterogeneities propagating inwards from the two surfaces lead to a lowering of imposed order , and hence lowering of free energy . as this destructive interference increases with decreasing separation between the two rods",
    ", there appears an effective attraction between the two surfaces .",
    "the hydrophobic force law has been inspected in computer simulations studies of 3d water models , but the validity of the same in reduced dimension , such as in the mb model , has not been looked at .",
    "recently , dill and co - workers have studied the behavior of confined mb water in enclosed cavities using @xmath17 and @xmath18 monte carlo simulation .",

    "[ fig : mb_hforce_pressure ] , the pressure in the confined region reaches of the bulk at @xmath40 .",

    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : op_profiles]b , the compressibility goes through a maximum at @xmath110 , suggesting a metastable minimum .",
    "a phenomenological description of hydrophobic force should therefore have at least two order parameters , namely density and orientational order ( which could be bond - orientational order depending on the system ) . in this case of mb liquid",
    ", density between the two phases ( liquid and honeycomb ) differs by @xmath114 , whereas the bond orientational order differs by @xmath114 .",
    "a ginzburg  landau free energy functional can be written in terms of two order parameters , one conserved ( number density ) and one non - conserved ( orientational density ) , to account for the non - local inhomogeneity , @xmath115 the first two terms on the right hand side correspond to each order parameter , and the third term considers the interaction between them .    the free energy per particle of the mb system should be maximum near the walls due to higher ordering , and should gradually reduce towards the bulk .",
    "one has to consider that the ordering is induced on both sides of the rod , so that the excess total free energy of the system for infinitely separated rods is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the maximum free energy obtained by allowing the order to propagate on any one side up to infinity . as the two rods are brought closer , the opposing orders interfere , creating a frustration and reduction of order at the center ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mb_orient_map ] ) .",
    "thus , the total free energy of the system decreases up to the extreme limit of @xmath118 when the two rods collapse .",
    "asymptotically , the total change in free energy in going from infinite separation to collapsed state is @xmath119 .",
    "this explains semi - quantitatively the attraction between the two rods at longer length scales .",
    "long range hydrophobic attraction plays a key role in several biological self - organizing processes , such as protein folding , assembly of membrane structures , ligand binding to hydrophobic patches on target proteins , micellar aggregation , lipid bilayer formation , etc .",
    "@xcite it is also crucial to phenomena such as mineral flotation , wetting , coagulation , and many processes that involve surfactant aggregation , _",
    "e.g.  _ detergency . deciphering the hydrophobic interactions",
    "can also have profound implications for drug design and delivery to specific target proteins in a cell .",
    "@xcite    the present work demonstrates that a significant , attractive force can exist between two hydrophobic rods in a simple 2d mmolecular liquid .",
    "the system exhibits an exponential increase in the attractive force as the two rods are brought closer together .",
    "in addition , even the estimate of the range of the force is in rough agreement with experimentally observed range .",
    "although the mb model does not possess the complexity of interactions experienced by real water molecules , it mimics many of the important anomalies and properties of water .",
    "the simplicity of the present model and the ease of visualization can therefore be harnessed to gain important insights needed to understand the puzzling ( and often controversial ) aspects of water .",
    "these are sometimes obscured by the complexity of the 3d models .",
    "microscopic analysis of the structure and orientation of the system reveals several important issues .",
    "the length scale of density fluctuations is found to be shorter in range than the length scale of hydrophobic force between the rods .",
    "in contrast , orientational heterogeneity propagates to longer lengths with a correlation length that compares well with that of the hydrophobic force law .",
    "hydrophobic force law is found to be a consequence of the minimum frustration of the extended h - bond network  the frustration being imposed by the hydrophobic surface .",
    "destructive interference between the orientational heterogeneity induced by the two surfaces creates a metastable ice - like phase in the central region , thereby lowering the free energy of the system .    with the insight gained from the mb model",
    ", it would be interesting to see an extension of this work to 3d water models with specific attention to orientation of the water molecules , which has largely been overlooked in past investigations .",
    "a detailed theoretical analysis with the orientational order parameter may be rewarding , and could complement our present understanding . on a slightly different note ,",
    "pattern formation in nature has been a fascinating and demanding field of research and the interfering orientational patterns appearing in this system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mb_orient_map ] ) could be an excellent model to study .",
    "role of orientation in the hydrophobic force law indicates that such interference as observed here may play an important role in directing protein association and self - assembly where attraction between extended hydrophobic surfaces is believed to be involved .",
    "in the mercedes - benz ( mb ) model , water molecules are represented as two dimensional disks with three symmetrically arranged arms , separated by an angle of , as in the mercedes benz logo .",
    "each molecule interacts with other through an isotropic lennard - jones ( lj ) and an anisotropic hydrogen - bond ( hb ) term in a completely separable form as @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes vectors representing both the coordinates and orientation of the @xmath27 particle and @xmath7 the distance between the centers of two particles .",

    "the anisotropic hb part of potential , @xmath126 is defined as @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "this form of the anisotropic potential ensures that neighboring water molecules form explicit h - bonds ( have favorable energy ) when the arm of one molecule aligns with the arm of another  the strongest bond occurs when they are perfectly collinear and are opposite in direction .",
    "the unit vector @xmath8 represents the @xmath129 arm of the @xmath27 particle @xmath130 and @xmath11 is the unit vector joining the center of particle @xmath131 to the center of particle @xmath132 .",
