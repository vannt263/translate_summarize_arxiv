    "in game theory , as formalized by von neumann and morgenstern @xcite , nash @xcite , and kuhn @xcite , rational players with common knowledge of rationality ( ckr ) locate equilibria by using fixed point theorems to optimize continuous expected payoff functions .",
    "these expected payoff functions , according to probability measure theory @xcite , can only be defined after the adoption of a suitable probability measure space supporting appropriate random variables , functions , and probability distributions .",
    "for instance , mixed strategy probability measure spaces were used by von neumann and morgenstern @xcite and nash @xcite , while behavioural strategy probability measure spaces were introduced by kuhn @xcite .",
    "in addition , correlated strategy probability measure spaces were introduced by aumann to model communication channels between players @xcite . in this last case ,",
    "communications necessitate a change of probability measure space , however a change of probability space does not always require communication .",
    "consequently , in this paper we introduce a method to analyze games using the infinite number of different probability measure spaces available to describe any given game and set of expected payoffs @xcite .",
    "our particular interest lies in the class of probability measure spaces which is consistent with the given game information constraints .",
    "that is , we consider only probability measure spaces which are consistent with rationality , ckr , and no communication channels between players .",
    "such probability measure spaces can exist , as we show later , simply because a number of different probability measure spaces are consistent with information flow via the game history set without any communication channels . in this paper , we suppose players may freely alter their choice of probability measure space among all those consistent with no communications or any other alteration in the game , in contrast to , for instance , previous work on correlated equilibria @xcite . for many games ,",
    "a change in the underlying probability measure space will not affect equilibria  witness the equivalence of mixed and behavioural strategies in games of perfect recall @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we argue that there exist games in which altering the choice of probability measure space will alter strategic equilibria . assuming rationality , ckr , and the usual game information constraints , players can search an enlarged space of alternate probability measure spaces to optimize their expected payoffs , and thereby locate novel equilibria improving their outcomes over those achieved using only the conventional mixed or behavioural strategy probability spaces of game theory .    in this paper",
    ", we assess for the first time whether the set of equilibria of any arbitrary game are entirely invariant under the altered mathematical parameterizations defined by different probability measure spaces .",
    "it does appear that equilibria are indeed invariant under alternate probability measure spaces for single - player and multiple - player - single - stage games .",
    "however , equilibria are not invariant under altered choice of probability measure space for multiple - player - multiple - stage games . in these games ,",
    "the adoption of alternate probability measure spaces by players can so alter the parameterized expected payoff functions as to generate entirely novel sets of equilibria .",
    "demonstrating this requires a significant generalization of the usual optimization methods of game theory .",
    "this is because alternate probability measure spaces and parameterizations can alter the functional form , dimensionality , continuity and differentiability properties of what must now be treated as expected payoff functionals ( not functions ) . as a result ,",
    "the multiple - player calculus methods ( essentially fixed point theorems ) suitable for expected payoff functions defined over continuous probability simplexes are insufficient . to optimize expected payoff functionals",
    ", we must generalize the variational and functional optimization techniques used in , for instance , general equilibrium and cass - koopmans style optimal growth analysis @xcite , ramsey - style multiple stage optimization @xcite , and continuous time differential games @xcite .",
    "suitably generalized , these variational and functional optimization techniques can reconcile game theoretic prediction and observed human behaviour as we illustrate using selton s chain store paradox @xcite . in this game",
    ", backwards induction predicts that a monopolist never fights new market entrants even though , in practice , most monopolists will indeed fight new entrants and thereby improve their payoffs . this led selton to conclude  mathematically trained persons recognize the logical validity of the induction argument , but they refuse to accept it as a guide to practical behavior .",
    "this stark contrast makes this game a suitable vehicle for the presentation of our new methods .",
    "we consider the general strategic optimization problem faced by two players @xmath0 and @xmath1 seeking to maximize their respected expected payoffs @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a game where @xmath0 chooses events @xmath4 and @xmath1 chooses events @xmath5 to generate respective payoff outcomes for each player of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the chosen events @xmath8 are contained in @xmath9 , the set of all possible events in the game and in both player s chosen  roulette \" randomization devices .",
    "these devices are used by players to avoid their choices being forecast and exploited , with the result that the choice of events is described using a joint probability distribution @xmath10 .",
    "as is required in probability measure theory @xcite , the definition of this joint probability distribution requires player @xmath0 to adopt a probability measure space @xmath11 , and player @xmath1 to adopt a probability measure space @xmath12 , such that the joint product probability measure space @xmath13 supports the probability measure @xmath10 .",
    "we allow players to vary their choice of probability measure space to maximize their expected payoffs .",
    "altogether , the strategic optimization problem facing each player is @xmath14 here , expected payoffs for each player @xmath15 are defined by a lebesgue integral over all possible game and roulette events @xmath9 of payoffs @xmath16 resulting from particular game events @xmath17 weighted by the joint probability measure of those events occurring @xmath10 .",
    "the optimization involves each player @xmath18 maximizing their expected payoff over every possible joint probability measure space that might be adopted @xmath13 , where @xmath19 is defined in terms of an appropriate event set @xmath20 modelling all game and roulette device events , a suitable sigma - algebra @xmath21 , and an appropriate probability measure @xmath22 .",
    "game theory has not previously allowed rational players to vary their choice of probability space to maximize their expected payoffs .",
    "this is largely because von neumann and morgenstern s original goal was to formulate strategic plans assessing every possible move in a game @xcite , and they considered this goal required only that each player adopt a particular probability measure space defining mixed strategies in any game .",
    "( kuhn later introduced alternate behavioural strategy probability measure spaces providing an equivalent analysis in games of perfect recall @xcite . )",
    "while never stated explicitly , this restriction essentially limits the search space of the players so they can only optimize over the probability parameters of a single type of probability space using fixed point theorems to locate nash equilibria .",
    "in contrast , we argue that , under ckr , players can search every alternate probability space consistent with game information constraints by using generalized variational and functional optimization techniques . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we seek to explain heuristically why such a generalized analysis can generate novel and improved equilibria , and thus reconcile game theoretic prediction and observed human behaviours .",
    "alternate probability measure spaces can support different equilibria in strategic situations as each adopted probability space can mathematically parameterize the same random event in very different ways .",
    "for example , consider a player @xmath0 seeking to optimize a binary outcome specified by a random variable taking value @xmath23 with probability @xmath24 or @xmath25 with probability @xmath26 .",
    "these probabilities can be characterized in terms of a single probability parameter @xmath27 by tossing a biased coin , or in terms of five probability parameters @xmath28 say by using a biased dice . an alternative probability measure space might employ two sequentially tossed , independent , biased coins producing outcomes @xmath29 with probability @xmath27 , while if @xmath30 then @xmath31 with probability @xmath32 and if @xmath29 then @xmath31 with probability @xmath33 .",

    "( here , @xmath36 if @xmath37 and zero otherwise . ) as a last illustration , consider a probability measure space in which the above two biased coins are now perfectly correlated via @xmath38 . in this case , the known perfect correlation introduces a delta function to reduce the dimensionality of the joint distribution @xmath39 giving @xmath40 . in general , when parameterized using different probability measure spaces , a given probability possesses alternate functional forms with different dimensionality , correlation , continuity , and differentiability properties .",
    "this changeability of functional form and dimensionality requires generalized variational and functional optimization methods be used to optimize strategic decisions .",
    "the generalized methods we develop extend the calculus of variations which typically optimizes a functional @xmath41 $ ] of known form , and where the functional @xmath42 , the function @xmath43 , and the gradient @xmath44 have specified differentiability properties .",
    "for instance , a shortest path problem seeks to optimize the known functional @xmath41=\\sqrt{1+f'^2}$ ] via @xmath45 similarly , the shortest time or brachistochrone problem optimizes the known functional @xmath41=\\sqrt{\\frac{1+f'^2}{2gf}}$ ] via @xmath46",

    "all applications of the calculus of variations place severe restrictions on the range of variation of the form of the functional being optimized , so much so that a problem with an entirely arbitrary functional would be considered ill defined . in contrast , in a strategic optimization problem , players are able to arbitrarily vary their choice of probability measure space to alter all of the functional form , the dimensionality , and the continuity and differentiability properties of the functional being optimized .",

    "consequently , variational optimization may change the orientation and methods of evolutionary game theory @xcite and quantum game theory @xcite , among other fields , while the need to search infinite numbers of joint probability spaces will reinforce the importance of learning , a principal feature of evolutionary economics @xcite .",
    "similarly , variational optimization will impact  selfish gene \" theory which presently holds that genes optimize their fitness independently so altruism is explained by relatedness and the likelihood of shared genes @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we suggest that modelling the evolution of emergent hierarchical complexity in living organisms requires taking account of alternative probability spaces correlating system components ; correlated entities together constitute an indivisible unit which must be optimized as a whole .",
    "consequently , complex multicellular eukaryotes might well have optimized fitness by adopting correlating signals to multitask their dynamics by exploring alternate dynamical decision trees ( organismal probability spaces ) most likely by expansion of their rna signaling capabilities @xcite .",
    "similar considerations mean that neural networks can endogenously modify correlations among their components to explore an infinite number of alternate dynamical trees to implement complex cognition .",
    "game analysis also underlies the tree search  minimax \" algorithms of artificial intelligence @xcite which typically fail to emulate human intelligence . in chess playing , for instance ,",
    "expert human players typically employ pattern recognition and  chunking \" @xcite , and appear to be exploiting the same correlation information that underpins variational optimization .",
    "this is consistent with the  social intelligence \" explanation for the runaway evolution of primate intelligence where individuals dynamically realign their strategic partnerships to correlate behaviours to optimize outcomes in competitive group settings @xcite .",
    "it has long been thought that any strategic optimization problem was essentially equivalent to a possibly greatly enlarged non - strategic optimization problem .",
    "this equivalence arises as each player can introduce sufficient new variables to fully model all of the possible actions of all of their opponents . as a result , strategic optimization has been thought to be of equivalent complexity to , for instance , non - strategic physics optimization problems , and solved by similar methods such as the calculus of variations or the calculus .",
    "some have argued the converse . a perceived fundamental incompatibility between physics and biological complexity motivated mayr to claim that biology is an autonomous science rather than a subbranch of the physical sciences @xcite , with the factor missing in physics but present in biology being identified as  entailment \" ( essentially correlation ) by rosen @xcite , while it has been unconventionally argued that information science is incomplete and that it is our growing understanding of genomic programming and biological complexity that will contribute significant new insights in this field ( j. s. mattick , personal communication ) .",
