    "in particular , @xcite first noted that , in some gcs , the position of the minimum of the bss radial distribution nicely corresponds to the radius where the dynamical friction ( hereafter df ) time equals the cluster age .",
    "@xcite put this observable in an evolutionary context , connecting the shape of the observed bss radial distribution with the cluster dynamical age , thus defining the so - called `` dynamical clock '' , a fully empirical tool able to measure the stage of dynamical evolution reached by these stellar systems . in",
    "most of the surveyed gcs , the number of bsss , normalized to the number of stars in a reference population ( like sub - giants , red giants or horizontal branch stars ) , shows a bimodal behavior as a function of radius : it is peaked in the center , has a dip at intermediate radii , and rises again in the cluster outskirts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a similar behavior has been recently found also in the extra - galactic gc hodge 11 in the large magellanic cloud @xcite . in a few other cases",
    "the bss radial distribution shows only a central peak @xcite , while in @xmath4 centauri , ngc 2419 and palomar 14 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) it is equal to the radial distribution of the normal cluster stars .",
    "such a flat bss radial distribution has been found also in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , the comparative analysis performed by @xcite in a sample of 21 galactic gcs demonstrates that these stellar systems can be grouped on the basis of the shape of their bss radial distribution , each group corresponding to families of different dynamical age .",
    "the interpretative scenario is the following .",
    "being significantly more massive than normal cluster stars , bsss are expected to experience a relatively fast segregation process , mainly as a `` natural '' consequence of the action of df , that makes them progressively sink toward the cluster center . in general",
    ", a `` test '' star of mass @xmath5 , orbiting at an average radius @xmath6 in a field of lighter stars with average mass @xmath7 decays toward the cluster center over a time @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the relaxation time at the mean orbital radius @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , once the other parameters are fixed , the larger the value of @xmath5 , the faster the object sinks to the center .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 is expected to increase with radius , because of its dependence on local density and velocity dispersion ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , heavy stars ( as bsss ) orbiting at large @xmath11 will decay extremely slowly , virtually unaffected by df ( unless they are on very eccentric orbits ) .",
    "instead , bsss that are closer to the center will decay quickly . on the other hand , because of their smaller masses , the reference population stars will be less affected by df , compared to bsss .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect that , over time , the region in which the normalized bss fraction ( @xmath12 ) is depleted by df extends increasingly outwards . in that region ,",
    "the behavior of the local bss fraction exhibits an absolute minimum ( at @xmath13 ) between a central peak ( made up of bsss already decayed , plus collisional bsss formed there ) and an external rising branch ( due to bsss that have not had enough time yet to appreciably decay to the center ) .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that in dynamically young clusters the minimum of the bss radial distribution should be close to the center , while for increasing dynamical age , it should be observed at larger and larger distances .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 can be used as the hand of a `` clock '' able to measure the stage of the dynamical evolution reached by stellar clusters , with df being the internal engine of this clock ( of course , for a meaningful comparison among different clusters , @xmath13 has to be normalized to a characteristic scale length , as the core radius @xmath14 ) .",
    "such a tool would also allow to recognize cases where the relaxation process has not started yet , from those where it is more advanced , possibly even close to the core - collapse phase .",
    "it may even help to distinguish between systems with a central density cusp due to core collapse , from those with a cusp due to an intermediate - mass black hole .",
    "the empirical indication of the validity of this simplified , df - based , picture is provided by the tight correlation found between the position of the minimum in the observed bss radial distribution and the relaxation time computed at the core or at the half - mass radius ( see figure 4 in * ? ? ? * ) . the trend has been also confirmed by additional observational studies ( see * ? ? ?",

    "indeed , these are the main routes to evaluate the role of df in shaping the bss distribution , since they offer deep insights on the influence of other important collisional phenomena , like those associated to close encounters and `` binary burning '' ( mainly taking place close to or immediately after the cluster core - collapse ) .",
    "therefore , our group is adopting numerical approaches with gradually increasing levels of realism , in order to precisely evaluate and disentangle the role of the various dynamical mechanisms involved . in @xcite",
    "we used a coupled analytical/@xmath0-body approach in the specific case of bsss in a gc ( i.e. , test particles only slightly more massive than the average , orbiting a background field with a mass spectrum ) , to ascertain that the observed bimodalities can not be due to a non - monotonic radial behavior of the df time - scale .    here",
    "we first discuss a semi - analytical approach to the problem , assuming that df is the only process driving the bss secular evolution ( section [ semian ] ) .",
    "then , we present collisional @xmath0-body simulations to take into account further dynamical mechanisms playing a role in determining this evolution ( section [ nbody ] ) .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "we neglect bsss formed through stellar collisions and only deal with the population generated by mass transfer activity in binary systems .",
    "we further assume that bss progenitors are dynamically inert hard binaries , meaning that they suffer only from the effect of df , and , moreover , their probability to actually become a bss is independent of the cluster environment . under these assumptions",
    "we can model the bss progenitors as point particles with mass equal to the sum of the binary components .",
    "moreover , we assume that the progenitors that eventually give rise to bsss are , at any time , just a random subsample of the overall progenitor population : hence , at any time , the radial distribution of these binaries well represents that of actual bsss . in other words",
    ", it is assumed that bsss and their binary progenitors ( that we assume as point particles ) are indistinguishable .",
    "moreover , we consider the cluster as an isolated system , with a discrete mass - spectrum consisting of only three species meant to represent ms stars below the to ( the lightest component which primarily contributes to both the overall gravitational potential and df ) , bsss ( the most massive component ) and the reference population ( the component with intermediate - mass stars and to which bss star counts are normalized , corresponding to red - giants or horizontal branch stars in observational studies ) .      as a first step in understanding the specific role of df in shaping the observed bss radial distributions",
    ", we followed a semi - analytical approach in which other simplifying assumptions are adopted in addition to those discussed above .",
    "we considered here the cluster dynamics governed by a static `` mean '' gravitational field ( @xmath15 ) , as due to ms stars ( `` field '' stars ) only .",
    "we then assumed that @xmath15 remains fixed in time and is generated by a constant , spherically symmetric and isotropic distribution of field stars , each of which is assumed to have a mass @xmath16 .",
    "their phase - space distribution @xmath17 is defined such that @xmath18 is the number of these stars in the phase - space volume element @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .    within this field , we considered the evolution of the stars in the two heavier components ( that we call `` test '' stars ) under the effects of the df against field stars .",
    "we neglected the self - gravity acting on all these components , as well as any interaction between test stars .",
    "hence , the stellar motion of any test star , with mass @xmath5 , position @xmath22 and velocity @xmath23 , is determined solely by the underlying gravitational field @xmath15 and by the df deceleration that we describe following the @xcite formula ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number density at radius @xmath6 of field stars moving slower than the considered test star . assuming that field stars are distributed according to the @xcite distribution function with a fixed scale length @xmath26 , an analytical expression ( see eq . [ [ grv ] ] in the appendix )",
    "can be derived for @xmath27 , while the gravitational field is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the total mass in the field star component .",
    "thus , once numerical values for @xmath16 , @xmath5 , @xmath29 and @xmath26 are chosen , the df deceleration acting on bsss and the reference stars is completely determined .",
    "in particular , we assigned to bsss a mass @xmath30 and to the reference population stars a mass @xmath31 . in physical units",
    ", this choice can be thought to correspond to @xmath32 for the mean stellar mass below the ms - to , @xmath33 for stars in the reference population and @xmath34 for bsss , all being appropriate values for the case of galactic gcs .    as initial conditions for the time evolution of the two evolving components",
    ", we generated a set of @xmath35 and a set of @xmath36 positions and velocities for their representative particles , following the same plummer distribution function used for the field stars .",
    "of course , in real clusters the relative abundance of bsss with respect to the reference population is much lower than it is assumed here .",
    "however such a large number of bsss is adopted to limit the poisson noise . to this end",
    ", we also generated @xmath37 sets of initial conditions by changing only the random seed , and we then merged the snapshots of the resulting simulations , after having reported the center of mass of each snapshot onto the origin of the coordinates .",
    "in addition , for each particle in each snapshot , we merged the three projections ( along each coordinate axis ) , thus obtaining ( from a statistical point of view ) three times more stars . in this simplified approach , such an overabundant bss population has no consequences on the system evolution , while it gives some spurious effects in the @xmath0-body simulations , as we will discuss later in sect .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the assumption of the same initial distribution function for both kinds of particles and the field component is empirically justified by observations : in fact , bsss are found to share the same radial distribution as normal cluster stars in dynamically young gcs , where df has not been effective yet in segregating massive stars toward the cluster center ( see the cases of @xmath4 centauri , ngc 2419 and palomar 14 in * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "starting from these initial conditions , the orbit of each test star , evolving under the total acceleration @xmath38 , was time - integrated by means of a 2nd order leapfrog algorithm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with constant time step . at given times",
    ", a snapshot of the system was extracted and the projected number distribution of the two heavier stellar species was derived in a series of concentric annuli around the cluster center . to further improve the statistics we superimposed the positions of the test particles in all the 20 realizations , as well as their projections on the three coordinate planes ( similarly to what done in the @xmath0-body model , see section [ nbody ] ) .      consistently with the observational quantities defined in @xcite , in figure [ nratio ] we plot the `` double - normalized '' bss radial distribution @xmath39 , i.e. the ratio between the relative fraction of bsss and that of reference stars in each radial bin , at various evolutionary times .",
    "the radial distance is expressed in units of @xmath26 , while times are in units of @xmath40 , namely the relaxation time computed at the half mass radius ( * ? ? ?",
    "- 72 ) of the field star system : @xmath41 for the plummer distribution .",
    "to guarantee both a good radial sampling and a large enough number statistics , we set a minimum threshold ( @xmath42 ) to the number of bsss and a minimum threshold ( @xmath43 ) to the width of each radial bin .",
    "then , the actual width of each bin was automatically determined as the minimum value larger than @xmath43 such that @xmath44 in that bin . in fig .",
    "[ nratio ] we chose @xmath45 and @xmath46 for all times , except at late stages ( @xmath47 ) where @xmath48 was used in order to get enough resolution also in the outer regions where the number of bsss is quite small , and for @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "uncertainties on the number ratios were estimated from the law of propagation of errors , assuming a poissonian statistics for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "for illustrative purposes , figure [ nratio_noav ] shows the @xmath53 profiles obtained by considering only one simulation in one projection direction . for obvious reasons , in doing this plot we had to reduce the bss number bin threshold , @xmath42 , by a factor @xmath54 and @xmath43 by a factor of a few times .",
    "unsurprisingly , with respect to fig .",
    "[ nratio ] , it can be seen a strong increase of the poisson noise , especially in the outer regions where the number of particles is the lowest .",
    "this example illustrates the importance of reducing counting noises , as done in applying the averaging procedure described above .    in order to properly characterize the shape of the @xmath55 distribution and the location of its minimum ( @xmath13 ) in each snapshot , we first computed the running average @xmath56 , with the aim of reducing fluctuations due to poor statistics",
    ". then , @xmath13 was defined as the distance from the cluster center of the absolute minimum of this average .",
    "while a flat behavior is set by construction at the initial time , a bimodality rapidly develops ( see fig .  [ nratio ] ) .",
    "moreover , the minimum of the normalized bss radial distribution progressively drifts outward at increasing evolutionary times ( note that @xmath26 is constant by construction in these plummer models ) , until an almost flat behavior is established at late stages ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "these results qualitatively confirm what suggested by the intuitive picture discussed above , namely that df by itself can give rise to a bimodal bss distribution .",
    "on the other hand , we note that although a central peak begins to develop from the very beginning , it is then rapidly leveled - off , at odds with what observed in real clusters .",
    "this is because , in this simplified model , the frictional decay of both kinds of test stars continue indefinitely with an unaltered efficiency , thus making the great majority of these stars to eventually decay to the innermost radial bins where , as a consequence , the peak in @xmath58 is dumped to nearly its initial value ( i.e.  @xmath59 ) .",
    "indeed , the innermost 5 bins ( @xmath60 ) in the bottom panel of fig .  [ nratio ] contains @xmath61% of the total test stars .    to quantify the level of bimodality of the distribution",
    ", we defined the parameter @xmath62 as the slope of the line that best - fits @xmath56 in the region of the rising branch ( specifically for @xmath63 ) .",
    "a visual inspection of the snapshots indicates that the dip in @xmath53 can be well appreciated when @xmath64 .",
    "parameter tends to become less sensible and easily lose the bimodal behavior . ]",
    "the time behavior of @xmath13 , as measured in all distributions having @xmath65 , is plotted in figure [ rmin_semian ] . from the inspection of this figure",
    ", we can state that ( despite the large fluctuations ) : @xmath66 the @xmath55 radial behavior shows a significant level of bimodality most of the time for @xmath67 ; @xmath68 there is a clear tendency of @xmath13 to drift outward .",
    "the gaps among groups of @xmath13 values shown in this figure ( e.g.  between @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , as well as the linear anti - correlation within these groups , are an effect of the adaptive binning procedure .",
    "to get deeper insights into the role played by df and , possibly , other collisional effects on the observed shape of the bss normalized radial distribution , we followed a more realistic approach making use of self - consistent , collisional @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the same basic assumptions outlined in sect .",
    "[ assumpt ] have been adopted .",
    "nevertheless , here we have an accurate and self - consistent dynamical treatment of the various fully interacting stellar components , naturally including df and close encounters , which are responsible for various dynamical phenomena ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the simulations were performed using the direct @xmath0-body code ` nbody6 ` @xcite with its graphic processing unit extension enabled .",
    "we adopted the `` hnon units '' ( also known as @xmath0-body units ) discussed in @xcite , where @xmath71 , with @xmath72 being the gravitational constant , @xmath29 the total gc mass and @xmath73 the total gc energy ( the sum of potential and kinetic energy , negative for a bound system ) . in these units ,",
    "the half - mass relaxation time is @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath0 is the total number of particles ( stars ) .",
    "while @xmath40 varies during the evolution because of the changes in both @xmath75 and @xmath0 ( a star is removed from the system when its total energy is positive and it is outside @xmath76 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "9.6 ) , in the following the time will be measured in units of @xmath40 as evaluated from the initial conditions ( at @xmath49 ) .",
    "note , finally , that , due to the freedom of scaling the simulation from hnon to physical units , only the mass- and the number - ratios of the species are relevant to the dynamics of the system , given the total number of stars .",
    "we fixed the total number of stars to @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , the same initial conditions were adopted for the three mass components : at @xmath49 they all follow a @xcite model with the same central dimensionless potential @xmath78 and king radius . as in the semi - analytical models",
    ", this corresponds to assuming no initial mass segregation and an observationally - justified flat radial distribution for the ratio between the number of bsss and that of reference stars initially . to check for possible dependences of the results on the initial cluster concentration , we ran three sets of simulations for three different values of @xmath78 , namely @xmath79 ( corresponding to king concentration parameters @xmath80 , respectively ) .",
    "as in the semi - analytical model , we assumed the reference population stars to have a mass @xmath81 , and bsss having a mass @xmath82 .",
    "the relative number of the three species is more tricky , since real cluster s bsss are numerically negligible with respect to the other two populations , but here high - enough statistics is needed to obtain meaningful results .",
    "we therefore assumed @xmath83 and ( as in section [ semian ] ) @xmath84 and @xmath85 , so as to get a reasonable compromise between realistic values and a good statistical sampling .",
    "as done in the model of sect .",
    "[ semian ] , also in this case we generated @xmath37 sets of initial conditions and merged the snapshots of the resulting simulations , as well as the projections on the coordinate planes , so as to obtain , at any sampled time , a `` super - snapshot '' made up of @xmath86 particles .",
    "the unrealistically high fraction of bsss increases the collisionality of the system in the central region , with the effect of making the evolution toward the core - collapse faster . nonetheless , in this preliminary study we preferred to keep the statistical fluctuations low , even at the price of assuming a less realistic fraction of bsss .",
    "however , in order to determine the importance of the enhanced collisional effect that this choice implies , an additional , more realistic , cluster model with @xmath87 ( and @xmath88 , @xmath35 ) was also considered but , due to the huge computational costs , no statistical sampling was possible for the initial conditions and only one simulation ( with @xmath89 ) was performed in this case .",
    "all simulations were run for several initial half - mass relaxation times or until ` nbody6 ` failed to meet the desired minimal energy conservation accuracy ( we set the @xmath90 parameter in ` nbody6 ` input file to @xmath91 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "we then extracted a snapshot per hnon unit of time .",
    "since the typical crossing time of our models is of the order of several hnon time units , this ensures that the evolution of individual star orbits is tracked in a relatively fine - grained way .      before going further in describing the bss radial distribution resulting from the @xmath0-body approach ,",
    "it is worth analyzing the overall evolution of the simulated stellar systems . in figures [ rlags1_4][rlags1_8 ] the evolution of three representative lagrangian radii ( @xmath92 , with @xmath93 being the percentage of the total mass they enclose in 3-d )",
    "is reported for the three mass components and for each of the considered @xmath78 values , while fig .",
    "[ rlags_w8_100k ] refers to the @xmath94 case .",
    "we chose : @xmath95 , that roughly measures the size of the core region , @xmath96 , that corresponds to the very outer halo , and an intermediate lagrangian radius delimiting a region of the cluster not participating to the late expansion phase of the system .",
    "their behaviors essentially confirm what expected from the known collisional relaxation processes in multi - mass systems , of which extensive descriptions can be found in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . here",
    ", it is worth pointing out that the heavier components evolve toward a core - contraction ( @xmath95 decreases ) , while the halo ( @xmath96 ) monotonically expands , with the evolutionary time scale being shorter for the heavier mass components ( cf .",
    "[ [ orbitaldecay ] ] ) .",
    "the halo expansion occurs mainly because the kinetic energy of ( dynamically `` cold '' ) halo stars increases during _ close _ encounters with ( `` hot '' ) core stars , especially in the central denser region .",
    "incidentally , this mechanism also explains the apparent lack of core - contraction for the ( lighter ) field stars ( their @xmath95 is never contracting ) , which is due to the injection of kinetic energy from the contracting cores of the heavier components .    in the same figures we also report ( as dotted lines ) the time evolution of the core radius of the reference population . to be as close as possible to the observational procedures adopted for real clusters , we searched for the best - fit king model to the central portion of the projected number density profile of the reference population and we defined @xmath14 as the radius at which the surface density drops to half its central value",
    ". this well corresponds to the core radius adopted in observational works and it allows a meaningful comparison among bss radial distributions determined in different gcs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the behavior of @xmath14 is close to that of @xmath95 : it shows a well defined contraction phase , followed by an expansion . the relatively sudden turnaround of @xmath14 and @xmath95 flags the onset of the so - called the core - collapse ( cc ) process .",
    "it can be seen that in our @xmath1 particles @xmath0-body simulations the cc phase starts at @xmath97 for @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "as expected , the cc time is anti - correlated with the initial cluster concentration ( i.e. , with the collision rate in the core ; see the `` heavy tracers '' case in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we point out that the particular values of @xmath99 are not meant to be used for a close comparison with observational data since they are specific to the simplified initial conditions adopted here .",
    "in fact , the evolution of the simulated systems is unrealistically influenced by the heaviest components which are largely overabundant ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) with respect to reality .",
    "indeed , it is well known that , in general , the higher these ratios , the faster the collisional relaxation and the earlier the cc time , compared to the single - component case .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that in a real gc , where the total stellar mass in bsss and reference populations relative to the total cluster mass is much lower than in our @xmath0-body models , the evolution is comparably closer to that of a single - component system , characterized by a later core - contraction phase .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by the @xmath87 simulation results , where the number ratios among the different populations are more realistic .",
    "as shown in figure [ rlags_w8_100k ] , the cc time in this simulation is increased by a factor 2.3 ( @xmath102 for @xmath89 ) with respect to the @xmath1 particle case .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that the @xmath1 particle simulations presented here are too rough to provide accurate estimates of the characteristic time - scales of the various dynamical processes .",
    "however , they can be used to investigate interesting trends and draw qualitative conclusions .",
    "the analysis of the trends shown in figs .",
    "[ rlags1_4][rlags1_8 ] is indeed quite instructive .",
    "in particular , the behavior of the lagrangian radii as a function of time nicely highlights the properties of environmental conditions in which df operates in real clusters .",
    "in fact , at odds with the static environment considered in the semi - analytical model , real clusters have time evolving environments where df drifts heavy stars toward the center , first , in a contracting core ( until the cc occurs ) , and then in an expanding core ( after the cc ) .",
    "thus , in the late evolutionary stages , df can be somehow contrasted by the core expansion .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that @xmath95 for the bss population is significantly smaller that the typical size of the central peak in observational studies . hence its time behavior ( which is qualitatively similar to that of @xmath95 and @xmath14 for the reference population ) is not expected to have a significant impact on the overall shape of the bss distribution , apart from a possible increase of the width of the peak and a stabilization of its height in the post - cc regime .      within the `` evolutionary '' picture described above",
    ", we now examine the @xmath55 profiles of the simulated @xmath0-body systems and compare them to what obtained from the semi - analytical model and the observations .",
    "the single super - snapshot shows a noisy behavior , hindering the automatic analysis of the bss distribution , which risks to lose important features ( such as the depth of the minimum ) and to fail a reliable evaluation of the bimodality .",
    "for this reason we used the adaptive binning procedure described in sect .",
    "[ resu_semian ] to build the @xmath55 profiles .",
    "the prescriptions adopted to determine the location of the minimum ( @xmath13 ) and to evaluate the bimodality level ( @xmath62 ) can also be found in that section . according to the observations , the distance from the cluster center",
    "was scaled to the instantaneous value of @xmath14 computed as described above .    in the lowest concentration case (",
    "@xmath103 , not shown here ) a central peak in the bss radial distribution is soon developed and the external portion of @xmath104 rapidly decreases without forming a significantly bimodal pattern .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the time - scale of the frictional decay depends predominantly on the density of the field stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this density decreases more gradually with radius in low concentration clusters than in those highly concentrated .",
    "hence , in the case @xmath103 the df time - scale increases more slowly outward ( i.e. , its efficiency keeps relatively high up to a larger radius ) than for @xmath105 .",
    "this can be seen in fig.s [ rlags1_4 ] , [ rlags1_6 ] and [ rlags1_8 ] , by comparing the slope of the inner lagrangian radius behavior with that of the intermediate radius for the bsss in the pre - cc phase .",
    "it is evident that in the @xmath103 case the trends of this two radii show more similar slopes than for @xmath105 .",
    "this means that in the @xmath103 model the bsss decay at a rate that is almost independent of the radius ( at least up to @xmath106 ) , thus making the double - normalized ratio to evolve very quickly towards the unimodal pattern .",
    "in fact , in order to ensure the persistence of a bimodal distribution , the bsss orbiting in the outskirts have to decay much more slowly than those orbiting in the inner region .",
    "representative examples of the radial distributions obtained in simulations with initial potential @xmath89 and @xmath107 are shown in figures [ ratio_8 ] and [ ratio_6 ] , respectively , for the labeled evolutionary times ( in units of the initial @xmath40 ) . by construction , @xmath104 is nearly constant and close to the unity at the initial time . as the evolution proceeds , a bimodal behavior develops , with an increasingly high central peak and a dip at intermediate radii ( see also fig .",
    "[ rmin_t ] ) . a number of interesting features can be inferred from these simulations :    1 .",
    "all snapshots show the formation of a sharp central peak in the bss radial distribution , regardless of the initial value of @xmath78 ( including @xmath103 ) ; 2 .   at odds with the findings of the semi - analytical models",
    "the central peak is a quite stable feature ; 3 .",
    "the number of bsss drifted to the center , because of the effect of df , increases as a function of time ; 4 .   in many cases",
    "the bss distribution is bimodal ( fig .  [ rmin_t ] ) .",
    "this effect is somehow mitigated by a progressive decrease of @xmath108 in the external regions , which makes the detection of bimodality difficult and needs to be further investigated ; 5 .",
    "the width of the dip seems to increase as a function of time , in nice agreement with the observations ; 6 .   in the latest snapshots ,",
    "the simulated bss distribution shows a monotonic behavior , with most of the bsss segregated in the central part and the external radial bins being essentially devoid of bsss ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ ratio_6 ] ) , in agreement with the bss distributions observed in family iii clusters @xcite ; 7 .   in the cases",
    "where the bimodality is clearly distinguishable , an outward drift of the dip for increasing evolutionary time is seen before the cc phase ( see figure [ rmin_t ] ) .    remarkably , the shape and width of the central peaks in figs .",
    "[ ratio_8 ] and [ ratio_6 ] are also very similar to those observed in real clusters belonging to family ii ( i.e. , those actually showing a bimodal bss distribution ; see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as apparent in their figure 2 , the large majority ( @xmath109% ) of these systems have @xmath13 smaller than @xmath110 , consistently with the results of both our simulations with concentrated initial conditions and with the semi - analytical model results .",
    "these results seem to be confirmed ( at least qualitatively ) by the @xmath55 profiles obtained from the more realistic simulation run with @xmath87 and starting with @xmath89 ( see fig .",
    "[ ratio_8_100k ] ) , which will be deeply investigated and discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of a number of simulations aimed at exploring the connection between the evolution of the bss spatial distribution and the cluster dynamical age . in this first study we adopted simplified initial conditions and the simulations",
    "are not meant for a detailed and direct comparison with observational data but , rather , the goal was to explore the fundamental dynamical aspects driving the evolution of the bss spatial distribution .",
    "our results show a few features in nice qualitative agreement with observations and suggest that the dynamical mechanisms explored in this paper provide a promising route for the interpretation and understanding of the empirical dynamical clock found in our previous studies .",
    "our main result is that , because of the effect of df , the bss radial distribution develops a central peak and a minimum independently of the initial cluster concentration . in particular , the semi - analytical model ( which , among all the possible dynamical processes , takes into account df only )",
    ", shows the rapid formation of a bimodal distribution with a dip progressively moving toward the external regions of the cluster .",
    "however , this model fails to reproduce the formation of a long - lived central peak , which is instead observed in all dynamically evolved clusters @xcite .",
    "the results obtained from ( preliminary ) @xmath0-body simulations show the formation of a sharp and stable central peak and the development of a dip in the bss radial distribution , regardless of the initial @xmath78 . in spite of the noisy behavior of the snapshots",
    ", it can be stated that a bimodal distribution is set in many cases and the size of the dip tends to increase as a function of time until ( in the latest evolutionary phases ) the distribution becomes monotonic ( in full agreement with the observations ) .",
    "it is worth recalling the main differences between the two approaches we followed : @xmath66 in the semi - analytical approach the distribution of field stars is _ static _ , while in the @xmath0-body simulations the field component changes self - consistently with time , following the core contraction and , especially , the halo expansion ; @xmath68 in the @xmath0-body system , various collisional phenomena originating from 2-body and 3-body interactions with _ small _ impact parameters are acting during the entire evolution , while the semi - analytical model takes into account only the df effect ( i.e.  the consequence of 2-body interactions with _ large _ impact parameters ) . despite the higher degree of realism of the @xmath0-body approach , from the dynamical point of view",
    "the performed simulations are far from being representative of real clusters because of both a too small number of particles ( @xmath1 ) and an unrealistically high fraction of heavy species ( especially bsss ) with respect to the lighter background component .",
    "the main effect of these limitations is to induce a too fast global evolution of the system ( cf .",
    "figures [ rlags1_8 ] and [ rlags_w8_100k ] ) , producing unrealistically short dynamical time - scales for the simulated clusters , especially in the lowest concentration ( @xmath103 ) case .",
    "thus , it is very possible that the low - mass stars ( which are the main responsible for the df action on the test stars ) in a real gc behave much more like the static background in the semi - analytical , df - only approach , than in our ( small ) @xmath0-body simulations ( cf .  the long - dashed curves in fig.s  [ rlags1_8 ] and [ rlags_w8_100k ] ) .",
    "more realistic simulations are therefore necessary to investigate this possibility and to properly follow the time evolution of the bss radial distribution . in fact , while hints of a progressive outward movement of @xmath111 are found in some of the simulations presented here , no reliable constraints can be obtained about the characteristic time - scales of this process and the precise way the shape of the dip changes with time and the external cluster regions become devoid of bsss .",
    "more realistic simulations are needed also to clarify which are exactly the internal `` engines '' of the dynamical clock .",
    "the preliminary results presented here clearly point out that df is able to set the peak and the dip in the bss distribution .",
    "however , we still have to determine which is the dominant phenomenon ( and in what regime ) able to drift @xmath111 toward the external cluster regions ( either df only , or also the core expansion after the cc , or further dynamical processes ) .",
    "certainly , the presence of primordial binaries and an external tidal field should also be taken into account because the former would presumably favor a smoother collisional evolution of the system ( by mitigating cc ) and the latter would limit the expansion of the low - mass stars halo .",
    "these more realistic @xmath0-body simulations are in progress and will be described in forthcoming papers .",
