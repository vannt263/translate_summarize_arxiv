    "recently @xcite announced the remarkable discovery of a powerful bursting radio - source located about @xmath3 south of the galactic center ( gc ) .  was detected in 2002 during a radio transient monitoring of the gc region at 0.33 ghz , and appears to emit a series of bursts of typical duration @xmath1  min .",
    "the flux in a single burst is @xmath0  jy and no emission is detected between the events to an upper limit of @xmath4  mjy .",
    "the bursts seem to follow a regular pattern , with a time separation of @xmath2  min .",
    "the bursting source is unresolved and no counterparts are found thus far in other spectral bands .",
    "the quite high radio flux , combined with the limited spatial extent of the emitting region derived from the decay time of the bursts , implies a brightness temperature of @xmath5  k placing the source at the gc distance .",
    "if this is the case , a coherent mechanism is required to power the observed radio emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "a number of possible interpretations for the peculiar properties of have been examined by @xcite .",
    "their main conclusion is that , although the option that this is a close - by radio - source ( a very cold dwarf , or an extrasolar planet ) can not be dismissed , it appears much more likely that  is indeed located close to the gc . along this line",
    ", they consider both a radio - pulsar and a neutron star - neutron star binary as possible options .",
    "the case for a pulsar nature of  is more thoroughly discussed in a recent paper by @xcite .",
    "if one interprets the interburst time as due to orbital motion , according to the original suggestion by @xcite , the system may be similar to the double pulsar  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this _",
    "letter _ we further explore the possibility that  is a double neutron star system , following the proposal by @xcite , that the continuous emission from  could be due to coherent radiation , produced at the shock formed by the interaction of the relativistic wind of the more energetic pulsar with the magnetosphere of the companion .",
    "we develop a simplified model for  by assuming that : i ) the source is at the distance of the gc , @xmath6  kpc , ii ) the interval between the bursts is an orbital period , @xmath7  min , and iii ) the binary system consists of two neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "eight examples of ns+ns binaries in which one of the star is a radio pulsar are presently known . among these  is unique since both its components are detected as pulsars .",
    "moreover  is the only ns+ns binary ( @xmath8  h , @xmath9  cm , @xmath10 ; @xcite ) , which exhibits a continuous radio emission ( @xmath11  mjy ) about two times stronger than the emission from the two pulsars ( @xcite ) . the fact that unpulsed radio emission occurs in a double neutron star binary is of particular relevance in connection with  and is at the basis of the scenario we are proposing .",
    "so far it has not been possible to establish if the continuous radio flux from  exhibits an orbital modulation .",
    "were the continuous radio emission steady or weakly modulated , despite the alleged analogies , the two systems must differ in some respects , as discussed further on .",
    "the origin of the continuous emission from  is still uncertain .",
    "the starting point is assumed to be the interaction of the wind of the most luminous pulsar a ( @xmath12  s , @xmath13 , @xmath14  g ) with the magnetosphere of pulsar b ( @xmath15  s , @xmath16 , @xmath17  g  ) .",
    "a shock is produced when the energy density of the relativistic wind of a equals the magnetic energy density of b. since @xmath18 , the wind penetrates deep into the magnetosphere of b and the shock is well within b s light cylinder radius at @xmath19  cm from b ( @xcite ; tt04 ) . under the reasonable assumption that the shock is the site of particle acceleration , tt04 suggested two possible scenarios for the continuous emission .",
    "if the relativistic electrons originating in the shock fill a large volume ( size @xmath20@xmath21  cm corresponding to @xmath22 at the estimated distance of , @xmath23  kpc ) , optically thin synchrotron radiation is able to account for the observed flux . on the contrary , in case the size of the emitting region is comparable to that of the shock itself , the only way to circumvent severe self - absorption is to consider coherent emission .    in the picture we propose for  the coherent emission",
    "is activated when the relativistic wind of one component ( which we call a ) penetrates the magnetosphere of the other ( b ) , in analogy with what likely occurs in .",
    "however , as already noticed and at variance with the case of , the strong radio emission has a finite duration , @xmath24  min .",
    "a possible explanation is that the two nss in  are in rather eccentric orbits , so that the shock is inside b s light cylinder only when the separation between the two stars drops below a limiting value .",
    "clearly such a situation will occur only close to periastron , as illustrated in figure [ orbit ] .",
    "the orbit semi - major axis follows from kepler s law    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the total mass .",
    "the area swept by the radius in a time @xmath27 is simply @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the orbit eccentricity . from this",
    "it follows that the portion of the orbit centered at the periastron and travelled in a time @xmath27 is limited by the values of the phase angle @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath30 as a function of @xmath29 is implicitly given by    @xmath32    the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) for different values of @xmath29 and @xmath33 are shown in figure [ intersec ] ( full line ) .    the distance of the shock from b , @xmath34 , is given by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 assuming a dipole field , @xmath37 is the radius of star b , @xmath38 is the polar surface field , @xmath39 is the wind luminosity emitted by a in a solid angle @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the orbital separation .",
    "the burst radio luminosity at @xmath42  ghz is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the fraction of the total solid angle covered by the coherent radio beam .",
    "we take @xmath45 to be proportional to the fraction of @xmath39 intercepted by the shock    @xmath46    @xmath47 represents the efficiency for the production of ( coherent ) radio photons .",
    "note that the radio luminosity which appears in the previous equation depends on the orbital phase through @xmath48 and @xmath34 . to derive an estimate of @xmath39",

    "the shock is inside the light cylinder radius of b for the observed duration of the burst @xmath27 .",
    "the values of @xmath30 solutions of eq .",
    "( [ shock ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ intersec ] as a function of the eccentricity and for different values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; all other parameters have been taken equal to their reference values . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ intersec ] , the simultaneous fulfillment of both conditions is possible only in a quite restricted range of spin periods of star b , @xmath59 .",
    "the corresponding values of the eccentricity are in the range @xmath600.6 . in an even tighter interval of periods , around @xmath61 , a second solution for @xmath30",
    "is present at higher values of the eccentricity .",
    "the allowed periods increase with @xmath62 ; however , for @xmath63 they are still in the 0.30.4 s range . increasing ( decreasing ) the beaming factor @xmath44 ( the efficiency @xmath47 ) results in shorter periods . the shock distance from star b , as derived from eq .",
    "( [ endens ] ) , is shown in figure [ rs - lc ] ( left panel ) for @xmath64 . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ endens ] ) and ( [ edota ] ) it easy to see that @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding light curve is shown in figure [ rs - lc ] ( right panel ) ; no radio emission occurs when star b phase angle is outside the range for which @xmath66 . in figure [ rs - lc ]",
    "the orbital variation of @xmath34 and @xmath45 is shown for the parameters typical of  for comparison . in this case",
    "it is always @xmath67 .",
    "the shock distance changes only slightly along the orbit because of the lower eccentricity and the orbital modulation of the unpulsed flux is @xmath68 .",
    "the wind luminosity of pulsar b can be estimated as    @xmath69 ^ 2\\left(\\frac{p_{b}}{0.35 \\ , \\rm s}\\right)^{-4 } \\",
    "{ \\rm erg\\ , s}^{-1}\\ , .\\ ] ]    although the ratio of the wind luminosities @xmath70 is somewhat smaller than that inferred in , it is still @xmath71 and the energy density of the wind of a exceeds that of b by a factor @xmath1 at b light cylinder .",
    "this ensures consistency with our starting assumption about the shock forming as the result of the interaction of the wind of a with the magnetosphere of b.",
    "the scenario outlined in the previous section shows that if one chooses for the model parameters values close to those introduced above , the main observational features of  can be successfully reproduced .",
    "although the general picture we propose resembles that of , the two binary systems differ in more than one respect .",
    "in particular , the shock radiative efficiency needs to be higher in , @xmath72 as compared to @xmath73 in  ( tt04 ) .",
    "lower values of @xmath47 , in fact , result in smaller periods for pulsar b : this produces a steep increase of @xmath74 which soon would become @xmath75 at b s light cylinder radius . albeit coherence seems indeed to be required in both systems , no detailed model for coherent radio emission has been put forward so far . in tt04 some possibilities",
    "were suggested but the very model of coherent radio emission should be revisited possibly in the light of most recent studies on this topic ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported that  was not detected in two @xmath76  hr images obtained in 19961998 and in @xmath0  hr observations in 20022003 .",
    "while no conclusive evidence can be drawn from the shorter observations which have duration less than the orbital period , the lack of activity in 19961998 might pose a difficulty to the ns+ns binary model , as the same authors state .",
    "here we only mention that an `` on''``off '' state may be achieved if star a precesses . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the wind beam is @xmath78 wide and even a moderate precession angle can prevent the beam from a from intercepting the magnetosphere of b which subtends an angle @xmath79 .",
    "interestingly , the characteristic time @xmath80 ( @xcite ) for changing the system geometry due to geodetic precession of the spin axis of pulsar a is @xmath81  yr , assuming equal masses ( @xmath82 ) for the two stars .",
    "the range of @xmath57 and @xmath38 for which our model holds implies that neutron star b may be an active radio - pulsar .",
    "the required spin down luminosity of neutron star a ( see eq . [ [ edota ] ] ) is also compatible with it being a canonical radio - pulsar with @xmath83  g and @xmath84 s or a mildly recycled pulsar with @xmath85 g and @xmath86  ms .",
    "the latter possibility fits better with the standard scenario for the formation of a double neutron star binary ( e.g. @xcite ) , which predicts that the system should include a relatively young neutron star ( the one resulting from the second supernova explosion ) and a recycled pulsar ( the first born neutron star ) , spun up to tens of millisecond period by the short phase of mass transfer from the evolving companion .",
    "detectability of the pulsed signal from these two sources depends on the radio luminosity and favorable orientation of their beams .",
    "given the position in galactic coordinates ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) and for a distance in the range 612 kpc , the available models for the distribution of the ionized components in the interstellar medium ( @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate that scattering would prevent detection of any pulsating radio signal with @xmath89 shorter than few seconds at the frequency of 330 mhz .",
    "however , observations at frequencies higher than 1 ghz would preserve the possibility of discovering a @xmath60  s pulsar , while observing at frequency @xmath90 ghz is required for detecting a @xmath1  ms pulsar .    an x - ray luminosity coincident with the shock of @xmath91",
    "should be present , assuming that @xmath68 of the wind luminosity intercepted by the magnetosphere is converted into x - rays .",
    "however , the expected flux is extremely low , @xmath92 for _ xmm_-epic and _ chandra_-acis , assuming a power - law spectrum with index 2 and @xmath93 . we do not expect substantial emission in other energy bands , as in the case of , although the younger ns may be associated with a supernova remnant .",
    "indirect support in favor of a double ns system for  could come from further radio observations of .",
    "in fact , evidence that the continuous source is unresolved at the arcsec level would rule out the transparent scenario ( tt04 ) , leaving coherent emission from the shock as the only viable option .",
    "if the picture of  proposed here will be confirmed , one should consider that other similar systems may exist in the galaxy .",
    "their search among radio transients with programs analogous to that of @xcite , may be of the paramount importance for estimating the coalescence rate on ns+ns systems , a vital issue in connection with the response of new generation gravitational wave detectors like virgo and ligo .",
