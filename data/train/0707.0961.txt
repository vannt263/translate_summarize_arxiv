    "there are numerous effects in physics which are dependent on the dimension of the spacetime in which they live , and concepts which have mathematically simple models when restricted to one or two dimensions may become intractably complex as the dimensionality increases . furthermore , in some situations there is a sharp contrast in the behaviour of the system when the number of dimensions passes above or below a certain `` critical dimension '' . in the field of general relativity there are already some instances of such dimension dependent phenomena ; for example , the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite of black strings , and the work of belinsky , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite and its extensions @xcite , where the dynamics of a spacetime in the vicinity of a cosmological singularity were studied . in the latter case they found that the general behaviour of the relevant einstein solutions changed from `` chaotic '' in the low dimensional cases to non - chaotic in higher dimensions .",
    "it is this extra complexity and appearance of a critical dimension which is discovered in the work presented here .",
    "the issue of dimensionality has become of even greater importance over the past few decades , with the theories of hidden dimensions first postulated by kaluza @xcite resurfacing in the quest for unification and a theory of everything .",
    "originally it was hoped one extra dimension would be sufficient ; with the advent of string theory and its subsequent developments this was then expanded to twenty six in the late 1960 s as a consistency requirement for bosonic strings , before being reduced back down to ten with the introduction of supersymmetry in the 1980 s .",
    "the idea of holography also has its roots in dimensionality , and its most famous form , that of maldacena @xcite , states a relation between string theory on a five - dimensional anti - de sitter space , and a four - dimensional conformal field theory . much work ( see @xcite for a review ) has followed investigating spacetimes and conformal field theories of varying dimension and complexity .    here",
    "we present an analysis into the stability of radiating perfect fluid spheres in an asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetime . due to the confining nature of the ads",
    "potential , the spheres of radiation are self - gravitating , and thus we shall refer to them as `` stars '' in much of the following , although this is mainly used as a conveniently brief label , as it is only a toy - model approximation to a star at best .",
    "we begin by giving the equations for a such a model in @xmath0-dimensions , before analysing the behaviour of the star s total mass .",
    "we consider the variation of the total mass as a function of the central density , and observe that for large enough dimensionality , the mass increases monotonically with the density .",
    "however in the lower dimensional cases , oscillations appear ( this was originally noted in the @xmath1 case in @xcite ) , indicating that the perfect fluid model of the star is becoming unrealistic .",
    "we numerically find the critical dimension separating these two regimes to be @xmath2 ( to three significant figures ) , and give an explicit relation , , between the spacetime dimension @xmath0 and the `` saturation density '' @xmath3 , see section [ sec : criticald ] .",
    "the existence of local maxima at critical central densities ( saturation points ) in the lower dimensional cases indicates the appearance of instabilities in the model of the star , and point to unrealistic effects developing for @xmath4 .",
    "we also provide a numerical analysis of the behaviour at large central density , in particular the self - similar behaviour that appears in dimension @xmath5 ; several parameters of our numerical model are then also determined analytically from a dynamical systems analysis of the behaviour , where we consider the expansion about a fixed point of the zero - cosmological constant solution . ) was suggested after correspondence with v.   vaganov , who also considered the behaviour of self - gravitating radiation in @xmath6 in @xcite .",
    "work simultaneously conducted by p.  h.  chavanis also found the critical dimension described here , via an alternative route , in his comprehensive study of relativistic stars with a linear equation of state , @xcite ( see the note following the discussion for more details ) . ]",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we begin with a brief recap on perfect fluid models in general dimension in section [ sec : fluidmodels ] . in section [ sec : analysis ] we introduce the total mass as a function of the central density , analyse the progression of the saturation point with increasing dimension , and present the best fit formula , , which gives a value for the critical dimension",
    ". we also present further numerical results for the behaviour of the total mass at large central densities . in section [ sec : dynamsys ]",
    "we give a dynamical systems analysis , following the methods in @xcite and @xcite , which yields analytical expressions for several of the numerical results of the previous section .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of the results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "consider a general static , spherically symmetric @xmath0-dimensional ads spacetime with metric : @xmath7 by considering a perfect fluid of a gas of radiation , one can obtain implicit expressions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for a simple model of a `` star '' geometry .",
    "for a perfect fluid we have that the stress tensor is of the form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath0-velocity of a co - moving gas , and upon which we impose the further constraint that the matter be purely radiating ; this sets @xmath12 as it requires that @xmath13 be traceless .",
    "one obtains the required metric by solving einstein s equation : @xmath14 , with the above stress tensor and a negative cosmological constant , as follows .",
    "the relevant components of einstein s equations in general dimension @xmath0 are given by :    @xmath15    @xmath16    where we have used that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and set @xmath19 for convenience ; we include it here to ease comparison with the dynamical systems analysis of the @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) case given in section [ sec : dynamsys ] . ] .",
    "we can infer the form of @xmath9 from , as the @xmath8 dependence cancels , and we find that @xmath9 is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a mass function due to our definition of @xmath9 . ]",
    "related to the density via : @xmath24    in order to specify a form for @xmath8 , we recall the energy - momentum conservation equation , @xmath25 , which for a general perfect fluid without the radiation condition gives : @xmath26 which can be re - arranged to give @xmath27 in the radiation case , where we have introduced @xmath28 , which is the leading coefficient of @xmath29 at large @xmath30 , and is given by @xmath31 as @xmath32 . substituting @xmath9 from into and eliminating @xmath33 using",
    "then gives an equation in terms of @xmath23 , @xmath29 and @xmath34 , .",
    "@xmath35 which couples with our equation for @xmath36 : @xmath37 to give a pair of odes . for specified dimension @xmath0 , these allow the geometry of the spacetime to be numerically generated when they are combined with the relevant boundary conditions : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the condition @xmath39 specifies the central density of the gas , and we have that for fixed @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the single free parameter of the system ( pure ads is recovered when @xmath42 ) .",
    "whilst mathematically one can work with this perfect fluid setup in any number of dimensions ( including non - integer ones ) , one would also like to consider the appropriateness of doing so , given that we wish to use the geometry as the setup for a toy model of a star .",
    "in other words , is there any significant change in behaviour as the dimensionality of the model is altered . a particular quantity of interest in analysing the stability of the model is the total mass @xmath43 of the star , and as we have just seen ,",
    "the mass and density profiles of our gas of radiation are determined by a single parameter : the central density of the gas , @xmath41 .    to avoid possible instabilities such as those considered in the asymptotically flat case ( in four dimensions ) in @xcite",
    ", one would expect the total mass to increase monotonically with @xmath41 .",
    "one could also expect the total mass to be bounded from above by some maximum value , analogous to the @xmath44 asymptotically flat case where for a fixed size @xmath45 , the maximum possible mass such a star can have is given by @xmath46 , a result found by buchdahl in 1959 @xcite .",
    ", which is the lowest radius to which the schwarzschild geometry can be embedded ( in euclidean space ) . for more detail",
    "see e.g. @xcite . ]",
    "( top curve ) through to @xmath47 ( bottom curve ) .",
    "the saturation point for each dimension is indicated by the red dots ; these correspond to the maximum value of the total mass in the relevant dimension , at the critical density @xmath3 ( see section [ sec : criticald ] ) .",
    "for @xmath0 large , there is no local maximum and hence no finite saturation point ; in these cases , the maximum total mass is given by the asymptotic value , @xmath48 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    in our scenarios the total mass is indeed bounded from above , however , this maximum is not always the asymptotic value of the total mass at large density .",
    "although we observe that as @xmath49 we have @xmath50 , where @xmath48 is some finite constant dependent on the dimension @xmath0 ( see section [ sec : masslargerho ] below for more details ) , what we do not find in all cases is the total mass approaching this constant monotonically , see figure [ sat1 ] .",
    "when the dimensionality is low , there are sizable oscillations about the final value @xmath48 before the curve settles down ( see figure [ lowdplot ] ) , as was noted in the @xmath1 case in @xcite , and in other similar scenarios , e.g. @xcite , and the star s maximum mass is given by some value greater than @xmath48 .",
    "as the dimension is increased , however , these oscillations become less pronounced , and for @xmath0 sufficiently high they disappear altogether , see figure [ highdplot ] .    :",
    "as the central density @xmath41 is increased , @xmath43 does not simply increase monotonically towards its final value @xmath48 .",
    "instead , it reaches a larger maximum before undergoing damped oscillations towards @xmath48 .",
    "note that the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller as the dimensionality @xmath0 is increased.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    , there are no oscillations in the total mass : @xmath43 is now a monotonic function of the central density @xmath41 , and its maximum is also its asymptotic value as @xmath51 , namely @xmath48.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    ideally one would like to analytically determine the dependence of the shape of the curve on both the dimension @xmath0 and the density @xmath41 , however , due to the complexity of the equations , the exact behaviour must be computed numerically .",
    "one can nevertheless use this data to construct models of the various features of the star s behaviour : for example , in section [ sec : masslargerho ] below , we give an analysis of the total mass at large @xmath41 ( where it approaches a constant , dependent on @xmath0 ) in different dimensions .",
    "one particularly interesting feature is the appearance of the turning points in the total mass seen in figure [ lowdplot ] , and specifically the locations of the local maxima in different dimensions .",
    "one can see from the figures that as the dimensionality is increased , the appearance of the first maximum moves to larger @xmath41 ; by analysing this progression one can obtain a remarkably simple relation which immediately gives a value for the critical dimension , above which the oscillations do not exist , and hence the total mass is a monotonic function of @xmath41 .",
    "the saturation point , @xmath3 , which we define as being the location of the first local maximum when increasing @xmath41 , can be seen to progress to larger and larger @xmath41 as the dimension @xmath0 is increased , see figure [ sat1 ] .",
    "what we wish to determine is whether this saturation point appears for all dimension @xmath0 ( for sufficiently large @xmath41 ) , or whether there is a cut - off dimension , @xmath52 , such that for larger @xmath0 , there is no local maximum and hence no saturation point .",
    "figure [ peak1 ] shows how the saturation point varies with dimension ; numerical analysis then finds ( to 3 significant figures ) that this behaviour is given by the following model :    @xmath53    which gives a critical dimension @xmath54 . , where we obtain a value complementary to the numerical estimate of @xmath2 given here .",
    "interestingly , the exact value of @xmath55 appears in the case of newtonian isothermal spheres , as noticed by sire and chavanis in 2002 @xcite .",
    "] what is perhaps rather surprising is the simplicity of : not only do we have a critical dimension appearing so clearly , the overall dependence on @xmath0 is remarkably simple , and the co - efficient of the linear term appears to be exactly one half .     with increasing dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the points plotted are the calculated values for the saturation point for the star model in the corresponding dimension , the red best fit line is the curve given by .",
    "the divergent behaviour as @xmath0 approaches eleven indicates that for @xmath56 there is no saturation point , and hence no apparent instability in the perfect fluid model of the `` star '' .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    as we shall see in section [ sec : dynamsys ] , the value of the critical dimension can also be determined by an analytical consideration of the radiating perfect fluid system with zero cosmological constant ( i.e. in the limit @xmath57 ) .",
    "although such a solution is singular at @xmath58 , and has infinite mass , by confining the radiation to finite sized box one can obtain finite mass solutions .",
    "the features determined in this configuration can be related to equivalent behaviour in the asymptotically anti - de sitter case ( where the ( finite ) mass is confined by the ads potential ) , and indeed exact values for certain parameters can also be computed .",
    "this same analysis is not restricted to the star geometries considered here , it can be used with any linear equation of state @xcite , or even more generally @xcite . before giving the analysis for our case of perfect fluid radiation , however , we firstly present further numerical results .",
    "in addition to considering the variation of the saturation point for the star with dimension , one can also investigate the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath43 as @xmath41 becomes large . as mentioned in section [ sec : analysis ] , at large @xmath41 , the value of the total mass tends to a constant , @xmath48 , which is then only dependent on the dimension ; the value of this constant decreases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the values are plotted in figure [ etaplot1 ] and despite the complicated appearance of the plot , a remarkably close fit for all dimensions is given by :     for various dimensions , with the approximation given in shown in red .",
    "the data points are all at integer values for the dimension , with the addition of points at @xmath59 to highlight the behaviour of the curve at low @xmath0 .",
    "the righthand plot shows the behaviour of @xmath60 ; this is identical to that of @xmath48 for @xmath61 , however for @xmath62 , the maximum is given by the value of the total mass at the saturation point , @xmath3 .",
    "the best fit approximation ( red curve ) for each is simple in terms of its @xmath0 dependence , and provides a good fit over a large range of @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   for various dimensions , with the approximation given in shown in red .",

    "the righthand plot shows the behaviour of @xmath60 ; this is identical to that of @xmath48 for @xmath61 , however for @xmath62 , the maximum is given by the value of the total mass at the saturation point , @xmath3 .",
    "the best fit approximation ( red curve ) for each is simple in terms of its @xmath0 dependence , and provides a good fit over a large range of @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    @xmath63 - \\exp \\left[- 0.603 - \\frac{20.3}{d } \\right]\\ ] ]    which is also shown in the figure .",
    "checks show that the function continues to give accurate predictions for larger @xmath0 , and although there is perhaps slightly more complicated behaviour for @xmath64 , we do not attempt to investigate this further here ) the @xmath65 case ( where we have @xmath66 ) needs considering separately , as there is different asymptotic behaviour involved due to the non - dynamical nature of gravity in such a scenario ( see @xcite for example ) , we find that we can include it both here ( in the analysis of @xmath48 ) and also in our earlier result for the critical dimension ( see section [ sec : criticald ] ) . ] ; despite the relative compactness of the expression , there is little intuitive origin for any of the constants involved .",
    "nonetheless , it is impressive that the behaviour of the mass at large @xmath41 can be expressed in such simple powers of the dimension .",
    "one can perform a similar analysis of the behaviour of the maximum value of the total mass as the dimension increases ; the results are also shown in figure [ etaplot1 ] . for @xmath56 , the maximum total",
    "mass corresponds to the asymptotic value , @xmath48 , however , for lower dimension , the maximum is given by the mass at the saturation point .",
    "a good fit to the curve is given by : @xmath67 - \\exp \\left[- 0.592 - \\frac{20.5}{d } \\right]\\ ] ] which differs ( significantly ) from only in the second term ; this was to be expected , as the curves differ only at low @xmath0 .",
    "whilst their is little apparent significance about the values of the numerical constants involved in the expression , we have again produced a fit with a relatively simple dependence on @xmath0 which gives accurate predictions for @xmath60 over a large range of dimensions .",
    "although the form of the fit used in equations and was chosen primarily because it gave such a close fit to the data , it would be interesting to study possible reasons for expecting the observed dependence on dimension , although we do not pursue this further here .",
    "what we do now examine in more detail , is the oscillatory behaviour , which can be considered both numerically and analytically .",
    "another interesting feature of the plots of the total mass seen in figures [ sat1 ] and [ lowdplot ] is the self - similarity exhibited by the oscillatory behaviour as @xmath68 .",
    "a numerical analysis of the periodicity and damping of the oscillations seen for @xmath69 leads us to propose the following model for the total mass : @xmath70 \\cos\\left[\\mu_{d } - \\nu_{d } \\log(\\rho_{0})\\right]\\ ] ] which gives a good approximation for the behaviour in the region @xmath4 . in",
    ", @xmath48 is the asymptotic value of the mass discussed above , and the four parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants dependent only on the dimension @xmath0 .",
    "approximate values for these constants for @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given in table [ adddtab1 ] .",
    ".numerical estimates for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( to three significant figures ) for the model of the total mass given in .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "what we have seen in the above analysis is firstly the appearance of a critical dimension ( @xmath54 ) from the simple requirement of a stability condition on our perfect fluid model for a gas of radiation , and a numerical study of the behaviour in various dimensions .",
    "whilst the appearance of oscillations in the variation of the total mass with the central density @xmath41 in the lower dimensional cases had been noted before , we saw here that such oscillations do not appear to persist in the higher dimensional cases ( see figures [ lowdplot ] and [ highdplot ] ) .",
    "not only do the oscillations die down as the dimensionality is increased , by analysing the progression of the saturation point , @xmath3 , we find that they disappear completely for @xmath0 above a certain value .",
    "although this value was calculated to be @xmath2 in the original numerical analysis , the dynamical systems approach which followed in section [ sec : dynamsys ] not only gave a more precise , non - integer value ( @xmath77 , as first derived in @xcite ) , but also explained analytically why one sees a change from oscillatory to monotonic behaviour as one increases the dimension past this point .",
    "the section concluded by demonstrating how the @xmath72 and @xmath74 parameters of the numerical model could also be derived via this analytical approach .",
    "what is remarkable is that from a seemingly basic condition ( that of monotonicity in the variation of the total mass ) , one arrives at such a simple relation for the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath0 , namely equation .",
    "such simplicity could not have been expected given the complex nature of the initial setup , which allows the spacetimes in question to be generated only numerically from the coupled odes .",
    "the extensions @xcite to the bkl work on modelling a gravitational field close to a spacelike singularity also reveal a critical dimension of eleven .",
    ", and thus the evolution continues indefinitely for any lower number of dimensions .",
    "this has interesting consequences not elaborated on here , which are discussed in detail in the papers cited above . ] in their work they found that the general behaviour of the relevant einstein solutions changed from `` chaotic '' in the low dimensional cases ( @xmath62 ) to non - chaotic in higher dimensions ( @xmath78 ) , in much the same manner as we observe the transition from oscillatory to monotonic total mass behaviour in the radiating star case considered here .",
    "it is interesting that their work also reveals a critical dimension of eleven , and a more detailed comparison of the two different scenarios ( including an analysis to determine the exact ( possibly non - integer ) value of @xmath52 for their transition ) may yield further insight .",
    "it would be interesting to see if such a result appears in other investigations into scenarios similar to the radiating perfect fluid model considered here .",
    "for example , one could examine other physical equations of state to see if they exhibit the same behaviour , and indeed the work of @xcite and @xcite has pursued this idea further ( see the note below ) .",
    "finally , one could also look to explain the linear @xmath79 term which appears in , and whether there is any physical explanation for why the coefficient should take on the value of a half .",
    "unknown to the author , this phenomenon has also been simultaneously investigated in two other works . in @xcite ,",
    "vladislav vaganov analyses the behaviour of radiating perfect fluid models in @xmath0-dimensional ads spacetimes ; he notes ( as we do here ) that there is a significant change in the behaviour of the total mass for @xmath80 ( where it becomes a monotonic rather than oscillatory function of the central density ) , and demonstrates this not only for the mass but also the temperature and entropy .",
    "he also presents a dynamical systems analysis ( based on that given in @xcite ) of the behaviour for a general linear equation of state , @xmath81 , which includes the radiation case .",
    "this analysis complements the numerical results presented here , providing an analytic derivation of the critical density , which is determined to be @xmath77 , consistent with our relation .",
    "the specific analysis for the radiation case is given in section [ sec : dynamsys ] , where we give not only the derivation of the critical density , but also demonstrate how the dynamical systems technique gives analytical expressions for other parameters introduced in our numerical investigation into the self - similar behaviour for @xmath5 .    the second related paper , @xcite by pierre - henri chavanis , presents an in - depth study of the behaviour of general stars ( `` isothermal spheres '' ) with a linear equation of state in an asymptotically flat background .",
    "his results are again complementary , finding that there is monotonic behaviour for @xmath61 , in contrast to the oscillatory behaviour observed in lower dimensions . by asymptotic analysis",
    "he also finds the value for the critical dimension in the radiation case to be very close to eleven , and although there initially appeared to be a discrepancy between the two alternative calculations of the critical dimension in @xcite and @xcite , the latter was subsequently corrected to agree with the value of @xmath77 found in @xcite .",
    "his paper also includes a comprehensive investigation into the stability of the different regimes , looking at a number of alternative stellar configurations and considering the behaviour of other thermodynamic parameters ( entropy , temperature,@xmath82 ) , in addition to the mass .",
