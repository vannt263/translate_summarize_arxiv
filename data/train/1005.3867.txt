    "skutterudites , rm@xmath2sb@xmath3 ( r = rare earth element ; m = fe or co ) , are an important class of materials for studies of fundamental physics problems , since some of them exhibit unconventional superconductivity,@xcite while others show heavy fermion behaviors.@xcite in the applied area , certain types of filled skutterudites , such as iron and cobalt antimonides , hold the promise of becoming excellent candidates for real - life thermoelectric applications , particularly in the 400 @xmath9 800 k range . in the mid-90 s slack proposed the _ phonon glass - electron crystal _ ( pgec ) model,@xcite which established the lattice thermal conductivity , @xmath10 , as an important tuning parameter in the quest for thermoelectric materials with high _ dimensionless figures of merit _ , _ zt_.@xcite",
    "the filled skutterudites have been shown to have much lower @xmath10 s than their parent compounds , since heavy atoms , such as la , ce , yb or tl fill the cages of the open host structure and are expected to exhibit localized atomic vibrations , called `` rattlers '' , which scatter heat - carrying acoustic phonons .",
    "the presence of such localized oscillations superimposed on collective motions of plane wave modes are among a few known examples of einstein modes in nature .",
    "the `` rattler mode '' scenario seemed to emerge as the correct model for explaining experimental neutron time - of - flight scattering data and specific heat measurements in the filled skutterudites,@xcite thus providing a plausible explanation for the much lower lattice thermal conductivities in the latter compared to their parent compounds .",
    "however , the findings of a recent inelastic neutron experiment on ce and la - filled skutterudites suggested that the guest eigenmodes are coupled to lattice degrees of freedom.@xcite at the same time , some very recent theoretical calculations by veithen and ghosez@xcite have suggested a possible coupling of guest and host dynamics at low transfer energies in the densities of states in la - filled skutterudites , consistent with the findings of koza _",
    "et al._.@xcite furthermore , the same authors have suggested that heavier elements , such as tl , may possess single einstein modes in the density of states , while arguing that what has been interpreted as a second guest oscillator ( _ i.e. _ @xmath11150@xmath9200 k),@xcite could be due to coupled lattice vibrations.@xcite therefore , understanding the physical basis of the second einstein mode , _ @xmath12 _",

    "6(b ) shows noisy data which indicate that either ce@xmath83fe@xmath2sb@xmath82 does not exhibit dispersionless modes or that even if they were to exist they could not be resolved by the experiment .",

    "et al . _ , with no additional features standing out.@xcite    the dos comprises the sum of the modes of the system over all reciprocal lattice vectors at a given energy exchange .",
    "therefore , our experimental dos represents a superposition of many different bands and the relative contributions of each of them .",
    "thus , the important questions are not only _",
    "what is the scattering cross section of yb versus ce _ , since in the intermediate energy - transfer regime the theoretical calculations do not expect ytterbium or cerium to contribute to the density - of - states , but rather  _",
    "do dispersionless modes exist in the ce - filled compound _ and _ how do they compare with the contributions of coherent modes to the density - of - states_. we attribute the noisy broad shoulder with no distinct peaks in ce@xmath83fe@xmath2sb@xmath82 to a smaller relative amplitude of incoherent modes compared to yb@xmath1co@xmath2sb@xmath3 .",
    "the effects of the specific filler on the specific cage must be therefore considered .",
    "yb@xmath1co@xmath2sb@xmath3 seems to be a very special system , since it defies the traditional `` rattling mode scenario '' and seems to suggest a more complicated system than the ones previously described .",
    "the discrepancy between the theoretical calculation of spectral weight _ a _ and the experimentally measured one and the differences among densities - of - states between yb@xmath1co@xmath2sb@xmath3 and other similar systems suggest that a possible cause for the emergence of local modes in the 10  20 mev energy transfer range are incoherent lattice vibrations of yb nearest neighbors in the yb@xmath1co@xmath2sb@xmath3 cage , since at those energies yb is not expected to contribute directly .",
    "the dfpt calculation fully relaxes the filled structure , calculates the dynamic matrix at first and then performs the phonon spectrum calculation .",
    "thus , the dfpt calculations do include the effect of structure change , such as the structure relaxation and bonding strength change , due to the filling .",
    "in other words , these effects do contain the `` coupling '' of yb rattling and local sb vibrational modes in an implicit way .",
    "but no phonon - phonon coupling is explicitly included . in principle",
    ", there could be a change in the phonon dos in the 14  20 mev regime as a result of yb filling because the sb configuration of the cages does change in comparison with the unfilled systems",
    ".    altered lattice properties due to the presence of a heavy earth element could lead to localized `` pocket '' modes which manifest themselves as dispersionless modes at @xmath5 = @xmath85 = 12.4 mev , as well as in the 14  20 mev regime,@xcite i.e. , low - energy modes appearing in the gap of a phonon - gapped system resulting from a pseudo - vacancy at an impurity site . such modes",
    "result from the displacements of lighter atoms , such as sb , which are nearest - neighbor atoms to the yb filler .",
    "the vacancy which is left as a result of the displacement would be a mode associated with atoms moving in and out of these _ quasi_-holes in the lattice .",
    "the appearances of a second einstein mode ( @xmath12 ) and other sharp modes in the dos of yb@xmath1co@xmath2sb@xmath3 in the 14 mev @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 20 mev range ( where ytterbium is shown to _ not _ contribute to the phonon density - of - states ) are attributed to altered properies of the skutterudite cage due to the addition of ytterbium .",
    "given the high _ zt _ of the filled skutterudites over their unfilled parents , the above - mentioned coincidence of dispersionless modes from the phonon density of states with a second einstein mode indicates that the scattering of heat - carrying phonons occurs at a variety of energy scales and could also be owed to a novel mechanism which merits further research and investigation .",
    "our results have shown a pronounced peak in the phonon dos of yb@xmath1co@xmath2sb@xmath3 at _ @xmath5 _ @xmath16 5 mev , established from inelastic neutron time - of - flight scattering , specific heat measurements and theoretical calculations .",
    "this is interpreted as a `` rattler '' mode of yb atoms vibrating in the cage of the cosb@xmath7 host lattice .",
    "novel contributions of this work include the observations of the second einstein oscillator in the dos of yb@xmath1co@xmath2sb@xmath3 at @xmath85 = 12.4 mev , and the dispersionless modes in the _ @xmath5 _ = 14  20 mev energy - transfer regime .",
    "both are believed to arise as a consequence of ytterbium filling .",
    "it appears that incoherent modes from the cage itself are induced by the addition of yb and these also participate in heat dissipation .",
    "future acoustic experiments aimed at measuring differences between the elastic constants of filled and parent cobalt antimonides as a function of frequency should be performed in order to understand the significance of each `` rattler '' mode to the total lattice thermal conductivity , @xmath10.@xcite in addition , future experiments aimed at measuring the dos of filled cobalt antimonides as a function of filler concentration should try to assess the role of the corresponding filler on the number of intermediate energy modes , their amplitudes and possible energy shifts in the latter .",
    "the further understanding of intermediate energy modes will most likely illuminate the importance of filler atoms in filled skutterudite thermoelectrics and allow the engineering of materials with higher dimensionless figures of merit .",
