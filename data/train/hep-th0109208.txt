    "the renormalization of the electron self - energy in qed , in standard lfd , is already non - trivial in the sense that it involves non - local counterterms @xcite .",
    "this unpleasant feature is however a direct consequence of the choice of a preferential direction , the @xmath10 axis , in the determination of the quantization plane .",
    "this can be well understood in the covariant formulation of light - front dynamics ( clfd ) @xcite , as shown in ref .",

    "the counterterm needed to renormalize the electron self energy in first order perturbation expansion is simply dependent on the orientation of the light front , defined by the four - vector @xmath12 .",
    "we shall investigate in this article how the question of non - perturbative renormalization can be formulated in clfd .",
    "we shall first derive the general eigenvalue equation , whose solutions are the fock state components . as a first example",
    ", we shall illustrate our strategy with a simple model involving two coupled scalar particles .",
    "namely , the scalar `` nucleon '' @xmath1 radiates the scalar `` pions '' @xmath15 . in this simple example",

    "can not be solved perturbatively .",
    "we show how to determine , in a self - consistent manner , the non - perturbative mass counterterm .",
    "this counterterm is then calculated numerically .",
    "models involving two and three constituent bound states were also analyzed in @xcite .    in a more general field - theoretical framework , in the light - front tamm - dancoff approximation involving spin @xmath16 particles for instance",
    ", renormalization is not reduced to the introduction of a mass counter term . in this case",

    "these divergences and the sector dependent counter terms are absent in the scalar model restricted to the dressed `` one - scalar - nucleon '' system .",
