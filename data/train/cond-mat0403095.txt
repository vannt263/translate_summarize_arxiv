    "pseudogap phenomenon has become one of the hallmarks of high temperature superconductivity @xcite : while the suppression of the single particle density of states is observed in many quantities at a high temperature @xmath2 , which appears to _ increase _ towards half filling , the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 , together with the @xmath0 superfluid density , at the same time continuously approaches zero @xcite .",
    "being in dramatic contrast to the well understood behavior of the standard bcs superconductors @xcite , this puzzling phenomenon has prompted different explanations .",
    "these may be grouped into at least two conceptually separate camps .",
    "the first group postulates development of a second order parameter in the underdoped region , which competes with superconductivity and suppresses its transition temperature @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second interprets @xmath2 as a crossover temperature at which the cooper pairs , loosely speaking , begin to form , and the lower @xmath3 as the point where the phase coherence finally sets in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the suppression of @xmath3 is then attributed to the gradual loss of carriers near the insulating state at half filling .",
    "there is a significant amount of possible empirical support for the latter point of view : d - wave symmetry of the pseudogap @xcite , specific heat measurements @xcite , heat transport @xcite , microwave conductivity @xcite , and the nernst effect @xcite may all be understood as directly or indirectly supporting the proposed superconducting origin of the pseudogap temperature .",
    "some of the same measurements , however , may also be understood within a competing theory , and the physics of underdoped high temperature superconductors at present still remains controversial .    in this paper",
    "it is argued that the pseudogap phenomenon may in principle arise purely from strong coulomb interactions in a d - wave superconductor and sufficiently near half filling , _ without _ any competing order . while a competing order is possible , and",
    "indeed in some materials may even be likely in the underdoped region , it seems not to be required simply by the existence of pseudogap .",
    "furthermore , this is shown for a superconductor with only a _ weak _ attraction in the d - wave channel , so the mechanism behind the pseudogap considered here is different than in the real - space pairing approaches extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "deriving from coulomb repulsion , it is similar in spirit , although still different in detail , to the one in the rvb theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we consider what is probably the simplest model which contains the relevant physics , the t - j - u model in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , with the standard exchange term rewritten as the pairing interaction and with a strong repulsion , and study the evolution of the @xmath0 superconducting gap and the phase stiffness with doping . independently of its magnitude , the repulsion does not affect the dependence of the mean - field d - wave superconducting ( dsc ) gap on the number of particles , as it only shifts the ( unphysical ) bare value of the chemical potential . as a result",
    ", the saddle point value of the superconducting gap ( figure 1 ) continuously increases towards half filling , as found in other similar calculations @xcite .",
    "it is intuitively clear however , that for a large repulsion @xmath4 the superconducting order should eventually be weakened near half filling , since the cooper pairs , although formed , will have little space left to move .",
    "it is less obvious in which exact fashion should this occur ; for example , should the suppression be gradual or abrupt @xcite , or what its effect on quasiparticles should be @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is possible to make the physics behind this ` jamming ' effect quite explicit by introducing certain collective coordinates to describe the ( quantum ) phase fluctuations around the dsc saddle point : _ two _ densities of spin - up and spin - down electrons , and the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the crucial feature of our representation is that _ only one _ of the electron densities ( say of spin - up ) becomes the conjugate variable to the superconducting phase .",
    "this enables one to understand quantum ( @xmath0 ) phase fluctuations around the dsc saddle point within the theory of interacting bosons ( representing jointly the density of spin - up electrons and the order parameter phase ) moving in the fluctuating and interacting background provided by the density of the remaining spin - down electrons . a self - consistent calculation of the @xmath0 phase stiffness in such an effective bosonic system yields then generically a non - monotonic behavior with doping ( figure 2 ) .",
    "for @xmath1 large enough the phase stiffness at half filling vanishes , while the superconducting gap remains perfectly finite , and in fact large .",
    "the superconducting @xmath3 is then non - monotonic because it is determined by the smaller of the two characteristic temperatures @xcite , one set by the superconducting gap , and the other by @xmath0 superfluid density .",
    "it is not the bare superfluid density that vanishes near half - filling , however , but only the physical ( renormalized ) one that becomes reduced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the bare one , indeed , only increases towards half filling , since in a weakly coupled superconductor it is proportional to the electron density .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to @xmath3 @xmath0 superfluid density should continue to grow as doping is increased through the optimal doping , as observed in number of experiments @xcite .",
    "the characteristic temperature dependence of the superfluid density under the conditions of a large d - wave gap and a low @xmath3 is discussed in a separate publication @xcite .    in the previous work on the d - wave quasiparticles @xcite it was assumed that underdoping , known from experience to be detrimental to superfluid density , could be viewed as inducing quantum phase fluctuations into an otherwise standard d - wave bcs - like superconducting ground state .",
    "present results support that hypothesis .",
    "it was also shown that such quantum phase fluctuations lead generically to spin response which agrees in many details with the observations in underdoped y - ba - cu - o ( ybco ) @xcite .",
    "together with the present results , this lends additional credence to the idea that the underdoped cuprates may be understood as strongly ( quantum ) phase fluctuating d - wave superconductors .",
    "the effect of low phase stiffness on charge degrees of freedom will be discussed in a future publication @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec . ii the @xmath5 hamiltonian is introduced , and the superconducting saddle point is discussed in the functional integral formulation . the @xmath0 theory for the phase fluctuations around the saddle point",

    "when @xmath15 with @xmath16 the model becomes equivalent to the standard t - j model as derivable from the underlying hubbard model , since double occupancy then becomes completely suppressed .",
    "here we will relax this condition , and consider a general , and finite repulsive interaction @xmath4 .",
    "we will however , be particularly interested in the regime of parameters @xmath17 , which corresponds to a _ weakly coupled _ , but a _ strongly correlated _ superconductor .",
    "it is presently controversial @xcite , @xcite whether the canonical t - j model indeed supports the d - wave superconducting ground state .",
    "although interesting , this issue will be of little concern to us here .",
    "our philosophy @xcite , @xcite , @xcite shared by number of recent works @xcite , @xcite , is to start from the experimental fact that cuprates are d - wave superconductors at least for a range of dopings @xcite , and take that as the point of departure for further exploration of the phase diagram",
    ". we will therefore regard the hamiltonian ( 1 ) merely as a useful tool for introducing correlations into the _ postulated _ superconducting ground state .",

    "we will therefore be concerned exclusively with such a weakly - coupled superconducting state .",
    "figure 1 should of course be understood only as an illustration , as a more realistic calculation should include at least a sizable next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath48 .",

    "the mean - field analysis by itself would therefore suggest an increasing superconducting @xmath3 towards half filling , in blatant contradiction to the generic behavior of underdoped cuprates .",

    "our @xmath0 calculation has another interesting consequence worth mentioning . while a strong @xmath1 implies the existence of the optimal doping @xmath193 at which @xmath199 peaks , at @xmath0 there is nothing particular happening at that doping at all .",
    "in fact , as doping is increased above @xmath193 , @xmath0 superfluid density should continue to increase .",
    "this is precisely what is generally observed in high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the increase of superfluid density is continued until a higher doping @xmath200 , above which the superfluid density again starts decreasing .",
    "we believe this effect is likely to be due to disorder , about which few words therefore need to be said next .",
    "we found that without any disorder , and with all competing orders excluded , @xmath0 superfluid density in a strongly correlated dsc is suppressed near half filling , but always remains finite at finite doping .",
    "experimentally on the other hand , it appears that the superfluidity in high temperature superconductors is already lost below some critical doping @xmath201 .",
    "the addition of disorder to our bosonic description of quantum phase fluctuations in underdoped regime would be expected to lead to precisely such a behavior , as suggested by the studies of superfluid - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "recalling that electrons , and consequently our effective bosons , in reality interact via long - range coulomb interaction suggests the universality class of two - dimensional dirty bosons with @xmath202 , and @xmath203 @xcite , in accord with a number of different experiments in underdoped cuprates @xcite . in the overdoped regime , on the other hand , @xmath177 becomes small and the pair breaking effect of disorder will bring it , together with @xmath3 and the superfluid density , to zero at another critical doping @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "the precise mechanism of this suppression seems also in agreement with the present , albeit somewhat limited , experimental results on overdoped cuprates @xcite .",
    "this would also explain why @xmath0 superfluid density starts to decrease for @xmath205 , where it would still be increasing according to our picture , if there was no disorder .",
    "although in the present work we were concerned with @xmath0 , our picture of the quantum superconductor - insulator transition suggests that the universality class of the transition at @xmath206 in underdoped regime will be of berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type . indeed , under the assumption of a finite superconducting gap , vortex unbinding becomes the only known mechanism for the loss of phase coherence in two dimensions .",
    "possible bkt nature of the transition is supported by the observed large nernst effect above @xmath3 in underdoped cuprates @xcite , and the measurements of the microwave conductivity @xcite .",
    "it was argued recently @xcite however , that having the bkt transition well below @xmath2 set by a large amplitude @xmath177 requires a competing order parameter .",
    "the argument is as follows : the condensation energy per unit area of the bcs superconductor is @xmath207 , where @xmath100 is the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "since the coherence length is @xmath208 one finds that the core energy of a vortex is @xmath209 , the fermi energy , which is much larger than the bcs superconducting @xmath3 .",
    "this is why the superconducting transition of a weakly coupled superconductor is essentially mean - field in character , with an unobservably narrow critical region .",
    "it seems then that a competing order developing in the vortex core is necessary to bring the core energy down , so that vortices may proliferate at a low @xmath3 . that this , however , does not necessarily follow , one may see by realizing that the above core energy ( @xmath209 ) is nothing but the bare stiffness for the phase fluctuations",
    "the role of the competing order parameter would then be to reduce this stiffness with underdoping .",
    "but as we argued , this seems perfectly possible without any ordering , simply from the repulsion which suppresses phase coherence even at @xmath0 .",
    "as long as the @xmath0 stiffness is small , the bkt transition temperature will also be small @xcite .",
    "the problem with the argument in favor of the competing order is that it ignores possible quantum fluctuations arising from interactions , which are on the other hand , the main point of the present work .",
    "this work was supported by nserc of canada and the research corporation .",
    "the author also thanks matthew case for useful discussions .",
    "here we present the details of the derivation of the eq . (",
    "23 ) for the bosonic mean - field energy . within the local approximation discussed right above eq .",
    "( 22 ) , the partition function for the effective bosonic system becomes @xmath210 d\\rho_- e^{-\\int_0 ^\\beta d\\tau l_b } , \\ ] ] with the bosonic lagrangian @xmath211 where we have written the hard core interaction @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) explicitly .",
    "this way one can still write the standard coherent state representation of the partition function . one can then derive eq .",
    "( 23 ) as follows .",
    "first , decouple the hopping term by introducing the hubbard - stratonovich complex field @xmath147 : @xmath214 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber e^{-\\int d\\tau [ \\sum_{x , x ' } \\phi^ * ( x,\\tau ) ( t_b ^{-1 } ) _ { x , x ' } \\phi ( x,\\tau ) + \\sum_x \\phi(x,\\tau ) \\psi^ * ( x,\\tau ) + c.c . ] } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , calculate the partition function in the saddle point approximation . assuming that at the saddle point @xmath215 and @xmath216 , i. e. the _ static _ configuration , in the hard - core limit @xmath217 the partition function becomes @xmath218 where the mean - field hamiltonian is @xmath219 and the trace is to be evaluated over the four states as described below eq .",
    "since @xmath220 is local it factorizes into a product over the lattice sites , and thus the trace can be easily computed .",
    "finally , rescaling @xmath221 leads to the mean - field free energy as displayed in eq .",
