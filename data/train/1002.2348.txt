    " the mckay graphs of the finite subgroups of @xmath2  di francesco and zuber @xcite were guided to find candidates for classifying graphs for @xmath0 modular invariants by first considering the mckay graphs of the finite subgroups of @xmath0 to produce a candidate list of @xmath1 graphs whose spectra described the diagonal part of the modular invariant .",
