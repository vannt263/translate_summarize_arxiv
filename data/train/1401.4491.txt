    "the recent discovery of the higgs particle with a mass of about 126 gev at the lhc @xcite has made the standard model of particle physics complete , at least from the point of view of the electroweak interactions .",
    "we now have an experimentally verified weakly coupled and perturbatively renormalizable uv theory of the electroweak interactions as originally described by weinberg @xcite .",
    "neutrino masses can be accommodated in this scheme if there are right handed neutrino species , which can give a small mass to the neutrino via a see - saw mechanism , or they can have a finely tuned dirac mass . in this sense there is no theoretical need for more particles , except for the fact that renormalization group running produces a landau pole in the uv , far beyond any scale that can be tested in accelerator experiemnets .",
    "the standard model of particle physics ignores the problem of gravity and it s possible quantum completeness .",
    "a complete theory of nature should describe how to deal with gravity ( in the strong gravity regime ) and it should also explain the origin of dark matter .",
    "dark matter has so far only been detected by its gravitational effects on matter .",
    "previous claims of direct detection of light dark matter have not withstood the test of time : the lux experiment has refuted those claims soundly @xcite .",
    "this is where we stand today : we have the standard model , we have gravity , and we have very little guidance from experiment on what dark matter is made of .",
    "the clues we have from experiments and observation for physics beyond the standard model point to scales that are inaccessible , although the wimp miracle argument suggests that the physics of dark matter is around the corner .",
    "neutrino masses suggest the existence of right handed neutrinos below about @xmath1 gev , while the axion bounds suggest an axion decay constant , if an invisible axion exists , that is larger than about @xmath2 gev .    to make progress we need to address the hierarchy problem :",
    "the dimensionless number relating the cosmological constant to the planck scale involves a fine tuning of order @xmath3 .",
    "this is the worst offender in terms of being an _ unreasonable _ small number : not of order one , but there are others .",
    "we call this hierarchy a problem because is not stable under the renormalization group flow",
    ". we can not argue for its naturalness based on a symmetry principle @xcite . the best _ solution _ to the cosmological constant problem , if it can be called such , is based on anthropic arguments @xcite and the existence of a large number of vacua in string theory @xcite ( much larger than @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is the place where strings at a tev scale fits into the picture of naturalness : one tries to eliminate the appearance of additional high energy scales in nature and one asumes that the physics of quantum gravity appears close to the electroweak scale and in particular , that quantum gravity theory might be made of strings .",
    "if string states can have masses of order the tev scale , there would be very many new particles ( stringy resonances ) appearing at accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "analyzing such possibilities and their detailed phenomenology is interesting .",
    "even black holes could be produced in accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "string physics at the tev scale is not a well defined subject .",
    "i will proceed to narrow the definition in order to be able to fit a coherent description of what a status of strings at the tev scale can be described as separate from other phenomenology models .",
    "string theory is a theory where the fundamental particles in nature are replaced by the quantum excitations of a fundamental string .",
    "the superstring theory in 10d is anomaly free @xcite and is argued to be a perturbatively finite theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it is compatible with supersymmetry and grand unification .    with the advent of string dualities @xcite , the five perturbative descriptions of string theories in 10d are unified into a grander scheme where all of the string theories are limits of a single non - perturbative theory called m - theory .",
    "they are connected to each other by passing through a strong coupling . with the gauge / gravity duality",
    "@xcite not only can the dimensionality of physics depend on the duality frame , but string theory compactifications can be completely equivalent to quantum field theories at strong coupling . the lines between what constitutes string theory and quantum field theory research have been blurred to the point that it is hard to say what constitutes research in string theory and what does not .    for the purposes of this article , we will narrowly define string physics to mean that the particles we see are actual string excitations ( not d - branes nor any other non - perturbative effect ) and the string theory dynamics is perturbative at the string scale : the coupling constant controlling the splitting and joining of strings is small .",
    "we will furthermore require that the string scale is below about @xmath5 tev .",
    "perturbative heterotic string phenomenology puts the string scale close to the gut scale of about @xmath6 gev , and the kaluza - klein excitations above @xmath7 gev @xcite . for the string scale to be low and the physics to be described by perturbation theory it is necessary to use type ii string constructions , where the dynamics of gauge interactions and matter is described by open strings ending on drichlet - branes @xcite or d - branes for short .",
    "this review will cover constructions with d - branes and low string scales .",
    "also constructions that are inspired by the effective field theory of d - brane setups .",
    "we will also discuss the phenomenological implications for accelerator experiments and phenomenological bounds on such physics .",
    "given the constraints on the size of the paper and the number of references that can be included , it is impossible to cite all the works that have contributed to this body of knowledge , nor to be as detailed in the exposition as might have been desired .",
    "many of the cited works refer to specific examples , and they can serve as an illustration of the concepts , but not necessarily as the sole point of origin of an idea . the author apologizes for having to leave out many such works from the references that are cited . to address these issues ,",
    "many references are to other previous reviews .",
    "the reader should consult such works to get a more complete picture of all the literature on the subject .",
    "to describe d - branes , it is important first to describe how the type ii strings operate .",
    "the reader should consult a standard textbook for details @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of string theory is that one can define an s - matrix order by order in perturbation theory by performing a path integral over all 2-dimensional euclidean closed surfaces embedded in some space - time manifold @xmath8 . naively , the action of such a world sheet is just the volume of the embedded surface and this would correspond to the nambu - goto string.@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the induced metric on the world sheet . and",
    "@xmath11 is the string tension , which is needed to restore units .    to properly define the path integral one needs to include a world sheet dynamical metric @xmath12 and weyl invariance @xcite .",
    "quantum consistency requires conformal symmetry at the quantum level : the theory is at a fixed point of the renormalization group .",
    "this governs the properties of @xmath8 : @xmath8 satisfies the einstein equations coupled to matter .",
    "moreover , one has a critical condition where one can determine the space - time dimension of @xmath13 .",
    "this gives @xmath14 for flat space in the bosonic string .",
    "given such a background , one can then in principle find the spectrum of strings propagating in such a geometry .",
    "the main result is that the string spectrum in flat space gives particles of various spins and masses , but it is mainly characterized by regge behavior : the spectrum of masses versus angular momentum arranges itself in straight lines @xmath15 for various values of @xmath16 . only particles of spin less than or equal to two can be massless in this setup .    for general @xmath8 and at large volume",
    ", one can also show that deformations of the metric of @xmath8 and the matter content are realized by excitations of the string itself . to obtain",
    "space - time fermionic degrees of freedom one needs to introduce fermions on the string world sheet .",
    "the best way to do so in practical terms is via the neveu - schwartz - ramond ( nsr ) formulation of the string , where the world sheet theory on the strings needs to have world sheet supersymmetry . in this case",
    "the critical dimension is @xmath17 .",
    "supersymmetry on the worldsheet requires fermion partners to the @xmath18 bosons , which are usually called @xmath19 . in the nsr formulation of the string",
    ", these fermions can have various boundary conditions on a circle . if they are anti - periodic , we call it the neveu schwartz sector ( ns ) , and if they are periodic we call it the ramond sector ( r ) .",
    "it is in the second case that the fermions can have zero - modes on a circle .",
    "the quantization of these zero modes gives rise to a clifford algebra and the set of ground states are an irreducible representation of this clifford algebra : these are spinors . in the type ii string , these world sheet fermions can be both left movers or right movers .",
    "the boundary conditions need to be set independently for left and right movers .",
    "there are now four sectors possible : nsns , nsr , rns , rr .",
    "the first and last give rise to space - time bosons ( the ramond - ramond sector representation under the lorentz group is the product of two spinors ) .",
    "consistency requires that the ramond sector have only one possible chirality .",
    "if the chiralities of the ns - r and r - ns sector are opposite , then we call the theory type iia , and it is a non - chiral ten dimensional theory of gravity with 32 space - time supersymmetries ( this is @xmath20 susy in four dimensional field theory conventions ) . if the chiralities of the ns - r and r - ns sector are the same , the theory is called type iib and it gives rise to a chiral ten dimensional theory of gravity with 32 supersymmetries .",
    "massless states come from all four sectors .",
    "the rr - sector gives rise to generalized versions of electromagnetism for higher dimensional objects .",
    "the basics for computations of amplitudes requires a rather detailed understanding of conformal field theory on the world sheet @xcite , especially at higher loop orders ( see @xcite for recent progress on this issue ) and is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "the idea of d - branes @xcite is that in these theories one can introduce topological defects where strings are allowed to end .",
    "such an end to a string puts a boundary condition on the world sheet degrees of freedom : it can turn a left moving degree of freedom into a right moving degree of freedom . for bosons , having a fixed end",
    "is a dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "hence , the d - branes get their d prefix from this observation",
    ". such a boundary condition can preserve some of the supersymmetry .",
    "for the type iia string , the even d - branes are supersymmetric ( d0 , d2 , etc ) , while for the type iib string it is the odd d - branes that are supersymmetric ( d-1 , d1 , d3 ,  ) .",
    "the convention here is that a dp - brane has p spatial dimensions and one time direction .",
    "a d-1 brane is an instanton : it has no extension in time .",
    "the open strings ending on a dp - brane can also be quantized and are soluble in flat space for a flat brane . in particular , d - branes support massless spin one particles on their woldvolume : these are gauge fields .",
    "these also have regge behavior , where @xmath21 and the slope of the regge trajectories is different .",
    "the only massless particles are of spin less than or equal to one .    for weakly curved d - branes",
    ", one can show that the full effective action of the d - brane is a nonabelian generalization of the dirac - born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "notice that open string excitations can only carry momentum in the directions parallel to the brane : it s endpoints are not allowed to move away from the brane : the effective field theory of strings at low energies that ends on the d - brane lives in lower dimensions .",
    "one can have more than one dp - brane , parallel to each other . in the limit of zero distance ,",
    "@xmath22 d - branes can be stacked on top of one another and the number of massless spin one degrees of freedom is @xmath23 .",
    "these give rise to a non - abelian yang mills action at low energies . in the case of n branes on top of each other one",
    "gets a @xmath24 gauge theory .",
    "this is the case for oriented strings : where there is a clear left and right direction on the string , so each endpoint of the strings knows this information .",
    "strings can only split and join if they end on the same brane , and if the orientations of the string match .",
    "the joining of strings is like matrix multiplication and defines a generalized version of such matrix multiplication , called a star product , which can lead to a formulation of open string field theory @xcite .",
    "a left endpoint will have a fundamental charge of the @xmath24 and a right endpoint will have an anti fundamental charge .",
    "this can be thought of as remembering on which brane each string ends and with which orientation .",
    "strings stretching between different stacks of branes will be in bifundamental representations : fundamental under one stack and anti - fundamental with respect to the other and can have various spin quantum numbers . a good general reference on d - branes",
    "is the textbook by c. v. johnson @xcite    one can also get @xmath25 and @xmath26 groups if one allows unoriented strings .",
    "this requires a further projection called the orientifold projection : this is an identification between left and right movers on the world sheet ( one gauges this discrete @xmath27 symmetry ) .",
    "this is usually handled by a method of images .",
    "this projection deletes the information of orientation , so although each endpoint carries a fundamental charge , it can be either fundamental or anti fundamental : this depends on details of the projection .",
    "these orientifold identifications can have fixed points giving rise to quotient singularities in @xmath8 .",
    "if one places d - branes at a fixed sub - manifold under such a projection , one can obtain these other matrix multiplication groups as gauge groups .",
    "one can also do other types of identifications giving rise to quotient singularities called orbifold spaces @xcite .",
    "these keep the orientation of the string .",
    "all of these singularities give rise to consistent string theories with a well defined process for computing scattering amplitudes .",
    "they are not to be treated as singular : only the naive space - time metric and topology of @xmath8 will look singular . since a string segment always have two ends , all open strings are in generalized bifundamental representations : they are fundamental or antifundamental at each end of the string .",
    "this allows the introduction of symmetric and antisymmetric 2-tensor representations of @xmath28 .",
    "it is possible to get other groups at strong coupling , but those setups are beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "the coupling of open strings to each other is controlled by a coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "the coupling to closed strings is determined by this open string coupling constant , @xmath30 .",
    "this coupling constant is determined by the expectation value of a string field , called the dilation , @xmath31 .",
    "all of these coupling constants are measured at the string scale @xmath32 .",
    "the ten dimensional gravitational constant is then @xmath33 , and one can make @xmath34 by taking @xmath35 .",
    "this is , in the perturbative regime , the string length is much longer than the planck length .",
    "one has introduced a hierarchy of scales this way .",
    "the hierarchy is determined dynamically : it depends on the expectation values of the dilaton .    upon compactification ,",
    "the properties of the low energy theory will depend on the details of the compactification .",
    "the shape of @xmath8 can depend on continuous parameters called moduli .",
    "each of these acts as the analogue of a coupling constant in four dimensions .",
    "the same is true with the embeddings of d - branes on @xmath8 .",
    "these moduli need to be stabilized : there is no cosmological evidence of variations of the coupling constants observed in nature with time .",
    "potentials for moduli can be generated by a variety of effects , perturbative and non - perturbative .",
    "the details are beyond the scope of the present review . the number of vacua computed as the number of critical points of the moduli potential can be very vast @xcite .",
    "each of these can be considered as a different theory with different coupling constants for four dimensional observables .",
    "this set of vacua is called the landscape .",
    "the set is so large that it is impractical to list them : there are more such vacua than the number of photons in the visible universe .",
    "there is a lot of variety in this set of vacua , so there is no unique prediction from string theory that covers all of the possibilities .",
    "the most universal prediction , that is valid for all string theory vacua in a perturbative regime , is the existence of regge behavior at high energies controlled by the string tension .",
    "the string tension itself is a free parameter as far as low energy physics is concerned and various bounds can be put on it that are model dependent ( this is , they depend on the type of string background geometry and data that is chosen ) .",
    "the non - perturbative regions are less well understood , but cover most of the parameter space .",
    "now that we have the basic ingredients of string theory and d - branes , we can ask how to determine the low energy four dimensional physics .",
    "assume that we have a compactification of type ii strings of the form @xmath36 where this has the product metric , where @xmath37 is a six dimensional manifold .",
    "assume furthermore that there are d - branes ( possibly of various dimensions ) wrapping various cycles on @xmath37 .",
    "call these cycles @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a label , and it is assumed that the cycles @xmath38 are topologically non - trivial : a brane wrapping that cycle can not be deformed continuously to zero size .",
    "branes wrapping each @xmath38 will give rise to different gauge groups , which we will also label by @xmath39 .",
    "depending on if we are working in type iia or type iib string theory , and if we want supersymmetry the cycles are either special lagrangian 3-cycles ( for type iia ) , or holomorphic cycles ( for type iib ) . a more detailed description can be found in @xcite    the effective action for massless states in 10 d and the corresponding massless states on the d - branes is given roughly by @xmath40 all measured in string units .",
    "the first term is the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the second sum of terms are the low energy limit of the ( generalized non abelian ) dbi action for the d - branes , when we only consider the gauge field excitations .",
    "the term @xmath41 is the induced metric on the wolrdvolume of the brane . upon dimensional reduction to four dimensions , by taking constant excitations in the compactified dimensions @xmath42 along @xmath8 we find that @xmath43 the volumes of @xmath8 and @xmath44 can be very different from each other . the simplest way to see this is to choose a single d3-brane moving on @xmath8 .",
    "this has support at a point , whose volume is by definition one . in that case @xmath45 .",
    "the volume of @xmath8 can be very big . in that case",
    "the effective four dimensional planck length becomes very short ( the effective planck scale energy becomes large ) , and makes low energy gravity decoupled . on the other hand the field theory degrees of freedom on the d3 brane can still be interacting if we take @xmath29 to be small but finite . in the limit where the volumes of some @xmath44 are finite , but the volume of @xmath46 is infinite",
    ", one can decouple gravity and engineer an interacting field theory in four ( or other ) dimensions .",
    "this leads to a program called geometric engineering @xcite , where one uses the geometric information in higher dimensions to study the field theory dynamics of the engineered theory , and one solves geometric problems in higher dimensions to solve various details of the low energy dynamics of the field theory .    to have the string scale near the tev scale , we need a large volume for @xmath8 in order to fit the four dimensional planck scale correctly",
    "this can be disastrous for low energy phenomenology .",
    "the kaluza - klein excitations of charged particles could be very light and would be inconsistent with data : they are subject to the lep bounds . because the excitations on the d - brane live in lower dimensions ,",
    "their kaluza - klein spectrum might have nothing to do with the scale of @xmath8 , only with the scale of @xmath44 .",
    "hence , since these are the only degrees of freedom that carry charges under the low energy gauge groups that make up the standard model , they would not be produced in accelerator experiments because their mass would be out of reach .",
    "this can evade bounds on light charged particles @xcite .",
    "the problem fields associated to the kaluza - klein spectrum on @xmath8 would be made only of closed strings : these are neutral particles and couple to ordinary physics very weakly , with gravitational couplings .",
    "this is basically due to dilution of the wave function of the fields on @xmath8 , which requires a factor of @xmath47 to have normalized fields , not necessarily to the smallness of the closed string coupling constant @xmath48 .",
    "this solves the hierarchy problem between the string scale and the electroweak scale : they are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the same is true for the ten dimensional planck scale .",
    "however , it replaces it by the problem of why the extra dimensions are so large .",
    "the hierarchy problem becomes a geometric problem , where other tools of quantum field theory and classical gravity might give some insight .",
    "notice that for models based on this type of analysis , all large extra dimension bounds from accelerator experiments ( as in @xcite ) are bounds on _ stringy _ phenomenology as well .",
    "the same is true for supersymmetry , as many of these constructions can be made supersymmetric . since in principle",
    "neither large extra dimensions nor supersymmetry are predictions that are unique to string theory , one needs to go further to find evidence for string theory to be able to call it such . in general",
    "it turns out the string theory models are more restrictive : there are relations between couplings that are not _ just effective field theory_. these give additional tests that can be used to make claims about stringy physics being due to strings .",
    "the next variation on basic model building is the realization that product geometries as described in the previous section are not the only ones that are compatible with lorentz invariance in four dimensions .",
    "one can also choose geometries where the topology is a product of @xmath49 , but where the metric takes the form @xmath50 where the @xmath51 are coordinates on @xmath52 and the @xmath53 is the usual lorentz metric in four dimensions .",
    "the function @xmath54 is called the warp factor .",
    "this means distances in four dimensions depend on the location of an object in the higher dimensions .",
    "these distances are measured between fixed values of the coordinates in @xmath55 and orthogonally to @xmath8 . as such",
    ", the notion of energy scales depends on the location of an object in higher dimensions .",
    "this is the familiar redshift in gravity and does not indicate a disparity between the local string scale and the local 10 dimensional planck length .",
    "it indicates that there is a variation between the effective four dimensional planck scale ( which is a global definition ) and the local string scale , which needs to be corrected for redshift .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "this is familiar in the gauge / gravity correspondence @xcite .",
    "these geometries are necessarily not ricci flat , and need matter to support this curvature",
    ". if there are d - branes , they can themselves act as sources of the matter fields that bend the geometry .",
    "these matter fields deform the geometry in which the d - brane is embedded . doing this procedure",
    "systematically is called including the back reaction of branes .",
    "a single d - brane has a tension of order @xmath56 @xcite , not @xmath57 as would be naively expected for solitons .",
    "this is actually expected from the asymptotic behavior of the string perturbation series @xcite . for practical purposes",
    "this means that back - reaction can be ignored sometimes , band it can be tuned by changing the number of branes in a stack .    for a stack of dp - branes ,",
    "the back - reacted supergravity solutions are well known @xcite : they are extremal black p - brane solutions .",
    "they can have a near horizon region where there is an infinite redshift .",
    "the local string scale can be arbitrarily small depending on the location of an object in the ten dimensional geometry .",
    "one can take a low energy limit by focusing on this high redshift region .",
    "this observation leads to the gauge / gravity duality @xcite .",
    "which description is better depends on the t hooft coupling constant @xcite of the gauge theory : the gravity description is semiclassical at strong t hooft coupling .",
    "this provides a different avenue to solve the hierarchy problem : one uses redshifts to lower the electroweak scale relative to the four dimensional planck scale @xcite and one can even allow for infinitely large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "these redshifts might be generated by a stack of d - branes which is independent of the standard model , or might give a gravity dual solution to technicolor theories ( see @xcite for reviews of technicolor ) . in this case",
    "the techni - meson and techni - hadron resonances would give an effective string theory of the confined technicolor theory .",
    "such a string theory is iessentially indistinguishable from the ten - dimensional strings of type iia and type iib strings .",
    "field theory in higher dimensions as required by these setups will need a uv completion : the theories are not perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "as such , one will eventually have to reintroduce strings or another device to make the models uv complete .      an interesting question to ask at this moment",
    "is how we actually get chiral matter from stacks of branes .",
    "this is provided by how they intersect each other ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if two stacks of branes intersect transversely ( we can not remove their intersection apart from each other by small deformations ) , one can show that chiral massless fermions live in their intersection . depending on the angles between the branes , they can also preserve a fraction of the supersymmetry .",
    "since chiral fermions are required to build the standard model , this result shows that acceptable phenomenology from the point of view of basic particle physics is in principle possible .",
    "also , since the standard model gauge group @xmath58 can be embedded in product groups of the type @xmath59 , it is at least in principle possible to find a realization of the standard model within this class of models .",
    "chiral fermions can produce anomalies via loop diagrams .",
    "quantum consistency of a configuration requires that field theory anomalies are cancelled .",
    "a one loop diagram of open strings can have a field theory limit as a feynman diagram with the fermions propagating in the loop , this configuration is a cylinder , and in the case of unoriented strings one can also have a mobius strip .",
    "finiteness of the cylinder diagram ( or combination of diagrams ) provides for anomaly cancellation .",
    "the anomaly produced by the matter fermion loop arises from a region of integration over worldsheet parameters where the cylinder is a very thin strip tied into a loop .",
    "this is balanced by a tree level contribution from closed string exchange : this is the region of the worldsheet parameters where the cylinder is very long .in the string diagram , both processes are part of the same diagram : a cylinder .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig : cylinder ] .     versus @xmath60 channels .",
    "the wavy lines indicate possible external particles attached to the loop.,width=10 ]    this is the so called green - schwarz mechanism . if the anomaly polynomial does not factorize , one of the gauge groups will be anomalous , whereas if it factorizes , it is cancelled by a closed string exchange . from the point of view of the low dimensional effective action ,",
    "the closed string state that participates in the anomaly needs to have tree level couplings to the gauge groups .",
    "one can analyze when the field theory anomalies cancel in various interesting setups @xcite and find that the condition of anomaly cancellation can be derived from another consistency condition of string compactifications : tadpole vanishing .",
    "the idea of tadpole diagrams is very simple : d - branes are sources of rr fields , and indeed , they act as the fundamental charged objects under the generalized electrodynamics that they generate .",
    "when we put a gauge theory on a finite volume box , gauge invariance requires that the net charge vanishes .",
    "the same condition needs to be applied to setups where d - branes wrap various cycles : they are a source for the field strength in the compact directions and the charge needs to go somewhere .",
    "the tadpole constraints are in general stronger than anomaly cancellation and they imply the cubic anomaly cancellation @xcite .",
    "factorization of anomalies means that the @xmath61 sector of @xmath24 can have mixed anomalies with some other gauge groups in four dimensions .",
    "the cancellation of these mixed anomalies is handled by the green - schwarz mechanism , and makes the @xmath61 massive .",
    "the closed string state that also participates in the anomaly is a scalar and has axion like couplings to the other gauge groups , while it has a shift symmetry under the @xmath61 that has mixed anomalies .",
    "gauge invariance of the kinetic term for this axion - like particle implies a stueckleberg mass for the gauge field .",
    "this mass comes from open - closed string mixing , and is of order @xmath29 in string units .",
    "such @xmath61 gauge fields are massive , but might be much lighter than other typical strings .",
    "a top down approach to phenomenology proceeds from trying to find a globally consistent solution to a string theory compactification .",
    "one chooses a geometry @xmath46 ( usually a calabi - yau manifold in order to have some supersymmetry @xcite ) and a uv string theory ( for most of this section we will take a type iia string theory ) .",
    "then we need to put supersymmetric branes that wrap various cycles in the geometry and verify the consistency conditions ( anomalies , tadpoles , etc ) .",
    "to have branes and satisfy tadpole conditions plus supersymmetry this necessitates an orientifold projection .",
    "after these choices are made , one computes the matter spectrum , the coupling constants ( as functions of the moduli , and not always doable in practice ) .",
    "one then needs to solve the dynamics .",
    "for example , how susy is broken and how the standard model lagrangian actually emerges . in practice",
    "this can not be done in full generality : we do not even know the metric of smooth non - trivial calabi - yau geometries .      the simplest way to get the standard model field content from a single stack of branes is to consider a grand unified theory .",
    "for example , one could try to produce a standard @xmath62 gut , with chiral matter in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 representations @xcite .",

    "usually this is done with supersymmetry .",
    "after these goals are met , one needs to compute the couplings of matter and check if all the standard model couplings are produced by tree level interactions or not .",
    "one also needs to analyze the associated moduli fields and find how they are stabilized .",
    "the literature on the subject is very vast and this review can not make justice to all of these developments .",
    "instead , we refer the reader to the following reviews @xcite . these contain most of the results up to 2008 .",

    "the gauge coupling constants in four dimensions are given by volumes of three cycles , thus they are of size @xmath72 , whereas the planck length in four dimensions is given by @xmath73 , this is , the string scale and the four dimensional planck scale can not be that different from each other , see for example @xcite . to change that , and keep supersymmetry",

    "developments related to analysis of such setups are reviewed in @xcite and involve a a lot of supergravity computations .",
    "because for most of these models lowering the string scale to the tev scale is difficult , we will move to other setups where this is more easily done .",
    "the idea of a bottom up approach is to take seriously the statement that the large extra dimensions ( the volume of @xmath46 ) are large and that at the same time , the cycles on which the d - branes that the standard model is supported on are very small , essentially zero .",

    "the prototypical example is an orbifold @xcite where one can actually compute the whole string partition function . in principle",
    ", this singularity can be attached to a variety of different compactifications , so the standard model physics does not uniquely determine one global geometry .",
    "instead , one just looks at the physics near the singularity and one imagines that it is possible to paste this information on various different possibilities , which we do nt assume we know .",
    "the low energy field theory predictions will not depend very much on this embedding .",
    "one can argue that closed strings decouple in this limit , as their wavefunction will be spread over @xmath8 , so they effectively only couple gravitationally .",

    "the best one can hope for with orbifolds is that we obtain a group with a quiver such that a sub quiver gives the standard model .",
    "one can look for models with 3 generations , and at least one three dimensional representation : this gives rise to a @xmath87 color group . to get representations that have dimension greater than one , one needs to use a non - abelian orbifold .",

    "one also finds that superpotential masses for leptons are forbidden , so in perturbation theory they need to be generated by higher dimension operators in the field theory , suppressed by the high energy scale ( the string scale ) .",

    "this is the case where tadpole cancellation requires the introduction of an additional d - brane in the spectrum that does not connect directly to the standard model .",
    "this is , the messengers that connect the standard model to the new sector are non - chiral with respect to the standard model .",
    "such model can have a sequestered low energy spectrum that might be a good candidate for dark matter .",
    "a recent example has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the main observation is that in an @xmath131 node there is no @xmath130 anomaly , but the @xmath131 stack might not cancel tadpoles .",
    "therefore one would need to introduce additional matter , made of open strings , charged under the @xmath61 which might end on another brane that would furnish the dark sector .",
    "these setups can give rise to fractionally charged matter that is not colored .",
    "one can also get a hidden valley scenario for dark matter .    in general , top down models can predict a lot of additional particles beyond the standard model .",
    "if they are chiral and charged under the electroweak theory , they get their mass from electroweak symmetry breaking . such particles are essentially ruled out by accelerator searches and such models should be considered to be ruled out . on the other hand ,",
    "when such matter is vector - like , it is allowed .",
    "this is well documented in other reviews ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "when strings are at a tev scale , it is hard to distinguish such states from other string resonances , so we will not pursue this issue further .",
    "so far , we have argued that the string scale is not an output of specific constructions and that it generically acts as a free parameter .",
    "certain field theory arguments ( what one can call indirect detection signals , or absence of them , like in fcnc s ) can push the string scale to be high , but it is also useful to understand what the direct limits on string state searches are and how they differ from other searches .",
    "this is usually handled at the level of a toy model : we make no attempt at seriously understanding issues related to flavor , axions , dark matter , and instead focus on the idea that string theory predicts stringy resonances with various spins and forming regge trajectories .",
    "the prototypical setup is the one pioneered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : we dress a familiar process like @xmath151 with some stringy information related to the presence of these additional resonances.this usually results in mutiplying a familiar amplitude by the veneziano amplitude .",
    "this is @xmath152 and @xmath153 the poles in the @xmath75 function we re interested in arise in the @xmath154-channel and give a peak in the cross section of the particle physics experiment .",
    "if we re not able to get to the string scale directly , then we do a taylor series in @xmath155 around @xmath156 and we get effective field theory corrections to an amplitude that is well known .",
    "these corrections are polynomial in @xmath155 , so they grow with the energy and would modify the tails of distributions for high energy collisions in a proton collider .    a more recent analysis",
    "@xcite considers other two to two scattering processes with the lhc collider in mind .",
    "in particular , the initial state is taken to be a pair of quarks , a pair of gluons , or a quark and a gluon .",
    "in particular , in that paper , they consider looking into the process @xmath157 where two gluons fuse and in the final state there is one gluon and a photon . since as described previously , the @xmath128 gets enhanced to @xmath87 , a single trace operator with four insertions can have the structure @xmath158 where there are three external gluons and one extra neutral vector boson particle .",
    "this one generally participates in hyperchagre , so it can be either a @xmath136 or a photon .",
    "this is a @xmath159 topology , which can also be used to detect some mixing angles of neutral gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "the other standard topologies to look for these resonances are @xmath160 and @xmath161 , so a resonance can be looked for in the dijet invariant mass spectrum .",
    "these ideas are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that in the @xmath162 channel , states that are not just the regge trajectories of the gluon can appear .",
    "if there is a spectrum of kaluza - klein excitations of the gluon , it could become available in this channel .",
    "if there is a notion of kaluza klein ( kk ) parity , such kk odd parity states are produced in pairs and the lightest kk odd state could be a candidate for dark matter .",
    "such reactions would lead to missing energy and are captured by other searches .",
    "direct bounds from these reactions are roughly @xmath163 ( see for example @xcite ) and is quoted as @xmath164 tev in the recent work @xcite .",
    "notice that these are based on a toy model of string theory at the lhc scale , where one just mutiplies a known amplitude by a standard kinematical factor that appears in many models with flat branes . in a realistic model one can expect that details will matter much more . in particular",
    ", one would expect that the different spin components would acquire different masses .",
    "a direct search bound for @xmath0 tends to push the string scale higher , but the bound is lower , @xmath165 ( assuming the same couplings as a @xmath136 ) .",
    "this pushes the string scale up because the mass of the ( anomalous ) @xmath0 is suppressed relative to the string scale by a factor of the open string coupling constant .",
    "general models with resonances in these channels can be analyzed as in @xcite to arrive at different ( more general ) bounds .",
    "to go further along this line of thought requires also the understanding of @xmath166 processes .",
    "the technology to deal with these amplitudes is developed in @xcite .",
    "one can also study @xmath167 scattering and @xmath168 scattering ( see @xcite and references therein ) and obtain bounds from cosmic neutrinos , finding a reach of about @xmath169 .",
    "one should point out that in quiver constructions , the neutrino is located on a different stack of branes than the gluon , so the effective terms in the action that can give rise to a @xmath168 reaction are double trace operators , and the amplitude should be suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath48 , limiting further the reach of such searches .",
    "at this point , it is perhaps appropriate to editorialize some sentiments ( not exactly predictions ) of the author with regards to the prospects of having string physics with a string scale at the tev scale",
    ". it is important to note that while strings at the tev scale are not ruled out by experiments , the case for them is not particularly good . in particular",
    ", one expects that a theory with a lot of states at the tev scale will run into trouble with flavor constraints : these particles will participate in loops and produce violations of flavor physics .",
    "indeed , they would be resonances of flavored quarks and they would carry flavor information . a serious attempt to do a theory of flavor with strings at the tev scale is compulsory if one is to explain the absence of flavor - changing neutral currents , and what is the mechanism responsible for their cancellation .",
    "toy models of theories of flavor ( as in @xcite ) seem to run into trouble with axions , so they push the string scale to be much higher , of order at least @xmath170 gev where the flavor bounds do nt matter anymore : all particles are too heavy .",
    "furthermore , one would expect that such a theory could also account for inflationary cosmological data and the matter anti - matter asymmetry .",
    "the author has not seen any convincing cosmological model where the scale of new physics can be that low .",
    "one should furthermore be warned that a string spectrum leads to a hagedorn transition right around the string scale and it is not clear what would be the cosmological signature of such a phase transition , or how that phase transition could limit cosmological models . in regards to axions , it should be very interesting to have at least one such axion to solve the qcd strong cp problem , but it s decay constant would be much larger than the string scale .",
    "not all axions have this property and understanding how to avoid this problem ( without sending all scales higher ) has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature .",
    "finally , any such model should have a serious candidate for dark matter and its associated phenomenology and in particular , it should tell us if it is a wimp , a hidden valley , or perhaps even an axion .",
    "the author would like to thank j. halverson and p. langacker for a critical reading an earlier version of this manuscript .",
