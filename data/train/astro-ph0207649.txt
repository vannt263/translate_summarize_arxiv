    "low frequency quasi periodic oscillations ( lfqpo ) are commonly observed in microquasars when a strong power law component is detected in their x - ray energy spectra , with a typical frequency of 0.110 hz . during the low hard state ( lhs )",
    "they have high amplitude ( @xmath8 rms ) , and during the intermediate / very high state ( is / vhs ) they have a moderate amplitude ( @xmath9 rms ) . their presence can be explained in the context of the accretion ejection instability ( aei , @xcite ) , which occurs in the innermost region of an accretion disk threaded by vertical magnetic field lines .",
    "the instability manifests as a spiral density wave ( a hot point ) rotating at @xmath10 of the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the disk , producing the modulation detected as a lfqpo .",
    "one would then expect the frequency @xmath11 of the qpo to vary as @xmath12 , r being the inner radius of the disk .",
    "we have shown @xcite that due to general relativistic effects this relation is modified whenever the disk is close to its last stable orbit ( lso ) .",
    "this could explain the behavior we observed in the case of 1655 , where the relation between the qpo frequency and the disk inner radius was inverted compared to 1915 @xcite , whereas the energy dependence of the qpo amplitude in 1915 may suggest the presence of a hot point in the disk @xcite .",
    "1550 is a microquasar @xcite hosting a black hole of @xmath13 @xmath14 @xcite , located at @xmath15 kpc @xcite . on 2000",
    "april 6 ( mjd 51640 ) , 1550 became active @xcite undergoing an episode of outburst . from mjd 5164451690",
    "the source was monitored with rxte .",
    "we fitted the pca+hexte spectra between @xmath16 and @xmath17 kev with a model consisting of interstellar absorption , a smeared iron edge at @xmath18 kev , and a power law .",
    "a high energy cut - off is needed to fit some spectra , and a thermal component is also included in some others .",
    "the evolution of the spectral parameters is plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : overview ] . based on the spectral evolution of the source we estimate that 1550 has transited from a low hard state ( ls , photon index @xmath192 ) ( mjd 5164451658 ) into an intermediate state ( is , photon index @xmath202 , thermal component ) between mjd 51658 and mjd 51660 .",
    "it stayed in that state until mjd 51680 , and then transited back to a ls at least until the end of our study @xcite .",
    "+    during the is the small values of the color radius returned from the fits , and their relative constancy over @xmath21 days suggest that the inner disk is close to its lso , in good agreement with the detection of hfqpo @xcite.the disk contributes a fairly constant @xmath22 kev luminosity of @xmath23 during most of the is , and after mjd 51674 the temperature starts to decrease and the disk becomes undetectable on mjd 51682 .",
    "although the late behavior of the inner radius is relatively difficult to constrain given the errors on this parameter , the disappearance of the thermal component on mjd 51682 , and the observation of a 65 hz qpo @xcite favors an interpretation where as the inner edge of the disk is moving outward , its maximum temperature drops down to low values .",
    "for both epochs the evolution of the qpo frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qpovsflux ] ) correlates better with the @xmath24 and @xmath25 kev band fluxes .",
    "if the evolution of the soft flux follows the behavior of the disk radius , as suggested by our spectral analysis , then the energy dependent frequency behavior favors an interpretation where the lfqpo is somehow related to the evolution of the disk . during the rising part ,",
    "the energy spectra of 1550 are dominated by the power law component .",
    "if that component characterizes an inverse compton effect of the soft disk photons as usually assumed , the rise to outburst may indicate that the disk is approaching the black hole during the initial low state .",
    "hence , although the frequency  flux relation is not absolutely linear ( left part of fig . [ fig : qpovsflux ] ) , the increase of the frequency with the flux still favors an association with the disk . when the disk brightens , in particular when it becomes detectable in the spectra ( from mjd 51660 through mjd 51680 , fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] ) , the plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qpovsflux ] , right ) becomes linear , which is predicted by the aei . the plateau and the inversion of the slope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qpovsflux ] ) occur at high soft flux , at times where the disk reaches the highest temperatures , and contributes the most to the energy spectra",
    ". if the disk is close to the lso during the is , and on mjd 51674 when the qpo re - appears , the decrease of the qpo frequency after the plateau ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qpovsflux ] ) might have the same origin as the frequency - radius inversion of the correlation observed in the case of 1655 @xcite , and is what one would expect from the theoretical predictions of the aei @xcite : when the disk is close to the lso , the rotation frequency of the spiral / vortex is modified due to general relativistic effects . as the disk is moving outward",
    "( decaying soft luminosity , and no detection of the thermal component during the final ls ) , the frequency of qpo decreases as expected when relativistic effects are negligible .",
    "the energy dependence of the qpo amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] left ) suggests a strong coupling between the compton medium and the modulation , since the amplitude is high ( in particular at low energies ) when the source spectrum shows a strong power law ( ls ) , and vice versa .",
    "if we assume the power - law flux is modulated and the soft component is un - modulated ( i.e. the flux from the soft component does not contain the qpo ) , the flattening of the qpo spectrum at low energies ( fig . [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) may come from the dilution of the power law by the soft component flux .",
    "however when we look at the qpo spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] right ) , where we plotted the modulated flux as a function of the energy channel , and superimposed the power law returned from the spectral fits ( i.e. with the same spectral index ) , it appears that during the ls there is a slight excess at intermediate energies , whereas during the is there is a flattening in the soft x - rays .",
    "our observations may suggest that the qpo originates from an independent medium , dynamically linked to the disk .",
    "the qpo flux at high energies would then simply reflect the inverse compton reprocessing of soft photons on the coronal electrons , while at lower energy this additional component would explain the observed spectra .",
    "+    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the addition of a 1.3 kev blackbody ( not shown ) may allow a better fit to the spectra , at least during the initial ls @xcite .",
    "this would be consistent with the theoretical predictions of the aei . in that case",
    ", the qpo would be the direct signature of the instability as it forms shocks ( spiral ) and warms locally the disk , giving birth to a local hot point a bit warmer than the entire disk in its average .",
    "we propose that theoretical predictions of the aei model match many observational constraints , starting with the non trivial evolution of the qpo frequency vs. the ( soft ) flux , and by extension the disk radius .",
    "we show that a hot point rotating in the disk , which is an expected signature of the aei , is compatible both with the frequency evolution of the flux modulation and the energy spectrum of the qpo .",
