    "one of the surprising properties of extrasolar planets is their distributions around their host stars .",
    "since many jovian planets have been found in the vicinity ( far inside the snow line ) of their host stars , numbers of theoretical models have been studied to explain inward planetary migration .",
    "recently understanding of planetary migration mechanisms has rapidly progressed through observations of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( hereafter the rm effect : @xcite , @xcite ) in transiting exoplanetary systems .",
    "the rm effect is an apparent radial velocity anomaly during planetary transits . by measuring this effect",
    ", one can learn the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis , denoted by @xmath2 ( see @xcite for theoretical discussion ) .",
    "so far , spin - orbit alignment angles of about 15 transiting planets have been measured ( @xcite , and references therein ) . among those rm targets ,",
    "significant spin - orbit misalignments have been reported for 3 transiting planets : xo-3b , hd80606b (; ) , and wasp-14b @xcite .",
    "these misaligned planets are considered to have migrated through planet - planet scattering processes ( e.g. , @xcite ) or kozai cycles with tidal evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) , rather than the standard type ii migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of such misaligned planets has demonstrated validity of the planetary migration models considering planet - planet scattering or the kozai migration . on the other hand , such planetary migration models also predict significant populations of `` retrograde '' planets",
    ". thus discoveries of retrograde planets would be an important milestone for confirming the predictions of recent planetary migration models , and intrinsically interesting .    in this letter ,",
    "we report the first evidence of such a retrograde planet in the transiting exoplanetary system hat - p-7 .",
    "section  2 summarizes the target and our subaru observations , and section  3 describes the analysis procedures for the rm effect .",
    "section  4 presents results and discussion for the derived system parameters .",
    "finally , section  5 summarizes the main findings of this letter .",
    "hat - p-7 is an f6 star at a distance of 320 pc hosting a very hot jupiter ( @xcite ; hereafter p08 ) . among transiting - planet host stars ,",
    "f type stars are interesting rm targets because these stars often have a large stellar rotational velocity , which facilitates measurements of the rm effect . however , the rotational velocity of hat - p-7 is @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ( p08 ) , which is unusually slower than expected for an f6 type star .",
    "nevertheless , this system is favorable for the rm observations , since the star is relatively bright ( @xmath5 ) and the expected amplitude of the rm effect ( @xmath6  m  s@xmath4 ) is sufficiently detactable with the subaru telescope .",
    "we observed a full transit of hat - p-7b with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds : @xcite ) on the subaru 8.2 m telescope on ut 2008 may 30 .",
    "we employed the standard i2a set - up of the hds , covering the wavelength range 4940    @xmath7 6180   and used the iodine gas absorption cell for radial velocity measurements .",
    "the slit width of @xmath8 yielded a spectral resolution of @xmath960000 .",
    "the seeing on that night was around @xmath8 .",
    "the exposure time for radial velocity measurements was 6 - 8 minutes , yielding a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of approximately 120 per pixel .",
    "we processed the observed frames with standard iraf procedures and extracted one - dimensional spectra .",
    "we computed relative radial velocities following the algorithm of @xcite and @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "we estimated the internal error of each radial velocity as the scatter in the radial - velocity solutions among @xmath94    segments of the spectrum .",
    "the typical internal error was @xmath95  m  s@xmath4 .",
    "the radial velocities and uncertainties are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we model the rm effect of hat - p-7 following the procedure of @xcite , as described in @xcite and hirano  et  al .  in  prep .",
    "we start with a synthetic template spectrum , which matches for the stellar property of hat - p-7 described in p08 , using a synthetic model by . to model the disk - integrated spectrum of hat - p-7",
    ", we apply a rotational broadening kernel of @xmath10  km  s@xmath4 and assume limb - darkening parameters for the spectroscopic band as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , based on a model by .",
    "we then subtract a scaled copy of the original unbroadened spectrum with a velocity shift to simulate spectra during a transit .",
    "we create numbers of such simulated spectra using different values of the scaling factor @xmath13 and the velocity shift @xmath14 , and compute the apparent radial velocity of each spectrum .",
    "we thereby determine an empirical formula that describes the radial velocity anomaly @xmath15 in hat - p-7 due to the rm effect , and find @xmath16.\\ ] ]    for radial velocity fitting , including the keplerian motion and the rm effect , we adopt stellar and planetary parameters based on p08 as follows ; the stellar mass @xmath17 [ @xmath18 , the stellar radius @xmath19 [ @xmath20 , the radius ratio @xmath21 , the orbital inclination @xmath22 , and the semi - major axis in units of the stellar radius @xmath23 .",
    "we assess possible systematic errors due to uncertainties in the fixed parameters in section  4 .",
    "we also include a stellar jitter of @xmath24  m  s@xmath4 for the p08 keck data as systematic errors of radial velocities by quadrature sum .",
    "it enforces the ratio of @xmath25 contribution and the degree of freedom for the keck data to be unity",
    ". we do not include additional radial velocity errors for the subaru data , because we find the ratio for the subaru dataset is already smaller than unity ( as described in section  4 ) .",
    "in addition , we adopt the transit ephemeris @xmath26 [ hjd ] and the orbital period @xmath27  days based on p08 .",
    "note that this ephemeris has an uncertainty of 3 minutes for the observed transit ; however the uncertainty is well within our time - resolution ( exposure time of 6 - 8 minutes and readout time of 1 minute ) and is negligible for our purpose .",
    "the adopted parameters above are summarized in table  2 .",
    "our model has 3 free parameters describing the hat - p-7 system : the radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath28 , the sky - projected stellar rotational velocity @xmath29 , and the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis @xmath2 .",
    "we fix the eccentricity @xmath30 to zero , and the argument of periastron @xmath31 is not considered .",
    "finally we add two offset velocity parameters for respective radial velocity datasets ( @xmath32 : our subaru dataset , @xmath33 : the keck dataset in p08 ) .",
    "we then calculate the @xmath25 statistic ( hereafter `` main - case '' ) @xmath34 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are observed radial velocities and uncertainties , and @xmath37 are radial velocity values calculated based on a keplerian motion and on the empirical rm formula given above .",
    "we determine optimal orbital parameters by minimizing the @xmath25 statistic using the amoeba algorithm @xcite .",
    "we estimate 1@xmath38 uncertainty of each free parameter based on the criterion @xmath39 when a parameter is stepped away from the best - fit value and the other parameters are re - optimized .",
    "we also fit the radial velocities using another statistic function for reference ( hereafter `` test - case '' ) , @xmath34 ^ 2 + \\left [ \\frac{v \\sin i_s - 3.8}{0.5 } \\right]^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term is _ a priori _ constraint for @xmath29 to match the independent spectroscopic analysis by p08 .",
    "figure  1 shows observed radial velocities and the best - fit model curve for the main - case .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the rm effect of hat - p-7b with the best - fit model and also shows a comparison with the case of @xmath40 and @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 model .",
    "the upper panel of figure  3 plots a @xmath25 contour in ( @xmath41 ) space . as a result",
    ", we find the key parameter @xmath42 , implying a retrograde orbit of hat - p-7b .",
    "the stellar rotational velocity is @xmath43  km  s@xmath4 , which is marginally consistent with the p08 spectroscopic result ( @xmath44  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "residuals from the best - fit model indicate rms of 4.14  m  s@xmath4 for the subaru dataset and 4.09  m  s@xmath4 for the p08 keck dataset .",
    "the rms of the subaru residuals is well within our internal radial velocity errors , and that of the keck residuals is in good agreement with the assumed jitter level of 3.8  m  s@xmath4 .",
    "one may wonder that a smaller @xmath29 allowed in the main - case would weaken the detection - significance of the rm effect .",
    "however , since @xmath45  km  s@xmath4 is excluded by @xmath46 , there is very little chance that a true @xmath29 is actually nearly zero and a spin - orbit alignment angle @xmath2 is very small .",
    "the lower panel of figure  3 plots a similar @xmath25 contour but for the test - case . in this case",
    ", we find @xmath47 and @xmath48  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "thus our two results ( main and test cases ) are well consistent with each other .",
    "in addition , we test the fitting with the eccentricity @xmath30 and the argument of periastron @xmath31 as free parameters . as a result",
    ", we do not find any significant ( nonzero ) eccentricity for this planet .",
    "the best - fit parameters and uncertainties are summarized in table  3 .    in the above analyses",
    ", we fixed several parameters as summarized in table  2 , which were based on p08 and . in order to estimate the level of possible systematic errors , we retry the fitting for following four cases ; ( 1 ) @xmath49 ( corresponding to 1@xmath38 lower limit of the impact parameter in p08 ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath50 ( corresponding to 1@xmath38 upper limit of the impact parameter in p08 ) ; ( 3 ) @xmath51 ( a greater limb - darkening case ) ; and ( 4 ) @xmath52 ( a smaller limb - darkening case ) .    consequently , we find that respective results for @xmath2 and @xmath29 are ; ( 1 ) @xmath53 and @xmath54  km  s@xmath4 ; ( 2 ) @xmath55 and @xmath56  km  s@xmath4 ; ( 3 ) @xmath57 and @xmath58  km  s@xmath4 ; and ( 4 ) @xmath59 and @xmath60  km  s@xmath4 . thus @xmath61  @xmath62 and @xmath63 ",
    "@xmath64  km  s@xmath4 can be still probable if the uncertainties for fixed parameters ( especially for the impact parameter ) are taken into account .",
    "these systematic errors would be significantly reduced when the kepler photometric data for hat - p-7 are available @xcite .",
    "the derived value of @xmath2 seems to indicate a retrograde orbit by itself .",
    "however , since the true spin - orbit angle @xmath65 also depends on the inclination of the stellar spin axis @xmath66 , @xmath65 is not necessarily greater than @xmath67 ( corresponding to a retrograde orbit ) even if @xmath0",
    ". thus one might wonder whether the planet hat - p-7b is statistically in a retrograde orbit .",
    "we can roughly estimate the probability using the relation of spherical geometry , @xmath68 note that @xmath66 ranges from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "we compute the true spin - orbit angle @xmath65 of hat - p-7b by substituting the observed values of @xmath71 and @xmath2 into the relation .",
    "we adopt @xmath22 ( p08 ) and test three representative cases for @xmath2 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "assuming an uniform distribution for @xmath73 within the range of value , the probabilities of a retrograde orbit ( @xmath74 ) are 99.85% ( @xmath75 ) , 99.70% ( @xmath76 ) , and 91.65% ( @xmath77 ) , respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath65 is always larger than @xmath78 ( the adopted value of @xmath71 , in the case of @xmath79 ) .",
    "those estimates favor a retrograde orbit of hat - p-7b .    on the other hand , it is important to point out that the stellar rotational velocity @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 determined by the spectroscopic analysis ( p08 ) is exceptionally slow for an f6 star .",
    "for example , hat - p-2 and tres-4 , which are other known planetary host stars with similar spectral type , have larger stellar rotational velocities : @xmath80  km  s@xmath4 ( hat - p-2 , @xcite and also confirmed from the rm effect by @xcite ) and @xmath81  km  s@xmath4 ( tres-4 , @xcite and also confirmed from the rm effect by narita et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the small @xmath29 may suggest a smaller inclination angle of the stellar spin axis . in that case , it is highly possible that the planet is in a nearly polar retrograde orbit .",
    "we note that too small @xmath66 can be constrained by the facts that a faster stellar rotation of hat - p-7 than 500  km  s@xmath4 would be physically unlikely due to stellar break - up , and that a faster rotation than 100  km  s@xmath4 would be empirically unlikely for a f6 star @xcite .",
    "translating the constraints into @xmath73 , we find a probability of such unrealistic cases is only @xmath90.03% , which has very little impact on the probability estimations for a retrograde orbit . in any case",
    ", it would be important to directly constrain @xmath66 by other observational methods ( e.g. , @xcite or asteroseismology with the kepler ) in order to estimate a true spin - orbit angle of hat - p-7b .",
    "we previously experienced a false positive of a spin - orbit misalignment in hd17156b due to lower precision radial velocity data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the problem for the hd17156 case @xcite was that radial velocity uncertainties were comparable with predicted rm amplitude and also due to a poor number of radial velocity samples .",
    "based on the lesson , we estimate the significance of our rm detection using the equation ( 26 ) in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the snr of our rm detection is over 10 , and thus we conclude to have obtained radial velocities of a sufficient number and precision to model the rm effect of hat - p-7b .",
    "nevertheless , we finally note that we should care about possible systematic errors in @xmath2 .",
    "since the rm amplitude of hat - p-7b is only @xmath82  m  s@xmath4 , any systematic shift as much as several m  s@xmath4 due to stellar jitter or other reasons at ingress or egress phase would cause a large systematic difference in @xmath2 .",
    "thus further radial velocity measurements for this interesting system are desired to confirm a retrograde orbit of hat - p-7b more decisively .",
    "we observed a full transit of hat - p-7b with the subaru 8.2 m telescope on ut 2008 may 30 , and measured the rm effect of this planet .",
    "based on the rm modeling , we discovered the first evidence of a retrograde orbit of hat - p-7b .",
    "this is the first discovery of a retrograde extrasolar planet .",
    "the existence of such planets have been indeed predicted in some recent planetary migration models considering planet - planet scattering and/or the kozai migration ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to point out that hat - p-7b is the first spin - orbit misaligned planet having no significant eccentricity",
    ". this discovery may suggest that other hot jupiters in circular orbits also have significant spin - orbit misalignments or even retrograde orbits .",
    "thus further rm observations for transiting planets , including not only eccentric or binary system planets but also close - in circular planets , would be encouraged in order to understand populations of aligned / misaligned / retrograde planets .",
