    "galaxy clusters are the largest virialised objects in the universe and , as such , provide useful cosmological probes . for example , the evolution in the abundance of clusters is strongly dependent on , and is therefore a sensitive probe of , the cosmological density parameter , @xmath0 , ( evrard 1989 ; frenk 1990 ; lilje 1992 ; oukbir & blanchard 1992 ) .",

    "in addition , the _ cnoc _ survey provides galaxy velocity dispersions for a well - defined sample of high - redshift clusters ( carlberg 1996 ) and further information on mass distributions is coming from weak gravitational lensing measurements ( luppino & kaiser 1997 ; smail 1997 ) .",
    "the modelling of the cluster population has relied heavily upon the expression provided by press & schechter ( 1974 ) for the mass function of haloes .",
    "this has received support from dark matter simulations of structure formation ( efstathiou 1988 ; white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 , lacey & cole 1994 ) .",
    "more recently the treatment of a baryonic component in simulations has led to a closer link with observational measurements ( evrard 1990 ; cen & ostriker 1994 ; metzler & evrard 1994 ; bryan 1994 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 , hereafter nfw ) .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the systematic uncertainties in the estimation of @xmath0 using cluster evolution , and to understand why the various studies differ .    in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] the cosmology - dependent model for describing the evolution of the cluster population is described . the procedure for and results from fitting the models to the observed temperature functions are presented in section  [ sec : evol ] .",

    "the spherical collapse threshold , @xmath17 , is employed for most of the analysis in the rest of this paper .",
    "bryan & norman ( 1998 ) report that their work , combined with the majority of published results , suggests that a slightly ( @xmath18 per cent ) higher value provides a better fit to mass functions from dark matter simulations .",
    "however , the recent simulations of tozzi & governato ( 1997 ) appear to support a lower value . this will be considered further in section  [ sec : omnotone ] .",
    "monaco ( 1998 ) has provided a review of the present understanding of the mass function .",
    "an additional crucial ingredient in the model is the conversion from virial mass to emission - weighted x - ray temperature : @xmath19 in this equation , @xmath20 is a conversion factor , the numerical value of which will be discussed shortly , and @xmath21 is the hydrogen mass fraction which is taken to be @xmath22 . if the specific galaxy kinetic energy equals the specific gas thermal energy within the virial radius , then a value of @xmath23 would be appropriate for an isothermal gas .",
    "alternatively , this value follows from applying hydrostatic equilibrium at the virial radius and assuming both that the sum of the logarithmic derivatives of the gas density and temperature profiles at this radius is @xmath24 and that the gas temperature at this radius equals the overall emission - weighted value .",
    "neither of these reasons is particularly persuasive .",
    "firstly , there is likely to be some residual kinetic energy in the gas as a result of incomplete thermalisation ( evrard 1989 ) .",
    "secondly , numerical simulations show that the gas density is dropping off faster than @xmath25 at the virial radius and that the temperature is also decreasing rather than remaining constant ( nfw ) .",
    "the value of @xmath20 chosen here is based solely upon the results of hydrodynamical cluster simulations .",
    "these usually include shock heating but no radiative cooling or heating from any source .",
    "such experiments ( nfw ; evrard , metzler & navarro 1996 ; eke , navarro & frenk 1998 ; bryan & norman 1998 ; frenk 1998 ) suggest that @xmath26 is a reasonable choice , and it is adopted as the default value in this paper , although the dependence of the results on this assumption will be investigated in section  [ sec : maxl ] .",
    "values returned from different types of hydrodynamical simulations for a variety of cosmologies range between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see bryan & norman 1998 ) , with a slight preference for larger values of @xmath20 when @xmath0 is larger .",

    "[ fig : beta ] .",
    "most importantly for estimating @xmath0 from cluster evolution out to @xmath30 , there is no significant evolution in either the mean @xmath20 or in the magnitude of the scatter about this value .",
    "= 9.0 cm    as the temperature function has such a steep dependence on cluster temperature , uncertainties and possible biases in the mass - temperature conversion are very important ( pen 1998 ) . a gaussian scatter of @xmath31 per cent in the temperature at a given mass has been included , consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] , when calculating the model predictions .",
    "the neglect of physical processes associated with galaxy formation in hydrodynamical simulations of clusters is a concern , but the work of metzler & evrard ( 1994 ) suggests that even extreme feedback from stellar evolutionary effects can not heat the intracluster medium of a rich cluster by more than about @xmath32 per cent .",
    "similarly , nfw found that @xmath20 was decreased by about @xmath31 per cent if preheating was included in rich cluster simulations in order to match the slope of the observed luminosity - temperature relation .",
    "the study by white ( 1991 ) comparing observed velocity dispersions with temperatures is also suggestive that non - gravitational processes have a relatively small effect on rich clusters . in section  [ sec : omnotone ] , the possible extent to which the results presented here might depend upon physics missing from the numerical simulations will be considered further .",
    "the cluster x - ray emission - weighted temperature measurements that are used here come from two different sources . at low redshift , an updated version of the flux - limited ( @xmath33  kev@xmath34wm@xmath35 w @xmath36erg s@xmath37 . ] ) sample of @xmath38 clusters compiled by henry & arnaud ( 1991 , hereafter ha91 ) is employed ( see henry 1998 for details ) .",
    "these authors report that this sample is `` at least 90 per cent complete '' . in this section",
    ", a completeness of 100 per cent will be assumed , but the effect of this uncertainty will be investigated further in section  [ sec : maxl ] .",

    "no systematic differences are found between these results and those of mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) for the @xmath43 cases where they studied the same clusters .    in each case",
    "the cumulative cluster temperature function is estimated using @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the maximum volume in which cluster @xmath46 could be detected given the survey selection criteria , and is calculated using the cluster fluxes and redshifts .",
    "a complication for the high - z sample is that the area of sky surveyed was a function of the sensitivity , only a small fraction of the total survey area was observed at the lowest flux levels . using the data in table  @xmath47 of henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , the following expression has been found to give the area of sky , @xmath48 , in which a cluster providing a detect cell flux , @xmath49 , would have been detectable by the _ emss _ : @xmath50 here , @xmath49 is in units of @xmath51w m@xmath35 and @xmath52 is the maximum area covered by the _",

    "can be compared with the model , a correction for incompleteness in the measured high - redshift temperature function is required .",
    "this arises because of the non - zero scatter in the luminosity - temperature relation and the fact that the high - redshift sample has a non - zero lower redshift limit . as a consequence , at the low redshift limit of the sample ,",
    "the flux limit of @xmath54w m@xmath35 corresponds to a non - zero luminosity limit such that for any given temperature , only clusters with luminosities higher than this limit will be included .",
    "the incompleteness will be greater for cooler clusters because , on average , they have lower luminosities . to calculate the amplitude of this effect",
    ", the data of ha91 for low - redshift clusters were used to provide both a mean luminosity as a function of cluster temperature and a scatter about this mean .",
    "what observational evidence there is suggests that the luminosity - temperature relation evolves very little out to redshifts of @xmath57 ( tsuru 1996 ; mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; henry 1997 ) .",
    "this gave @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath60  kev luminosity measured in @xmath61 w and @xmath62 is in units of kev , and a gaussian scatter in log@xmath63 of @xmath64 at any given temperature , the fraction of clusters that are actually selected is then just given by @xmath65 where erfc represents the complementary error function , @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the ( cosmology - dependent ) luminosity of a cluster at @xmath68 having a flux equal to @xmath69 . to allow for the fact that the catalogue flux limit refers to the _ emss _ detect cell whilst the clusters are typically more extended , a factor of @xmath70 has been included to account for the conversion between these two fluxes ( see figure  @xmath27 of henry 1992 ) .",
    "= 9.0 cm    the product of this factor and the differential number density at the same temperature can then be integrated with respect to temperature to give the correction to the cumulative temperature function . even for temperatures as low as @xmath71  kev",
    "the incompleteness is no more than about @xmath31 per cent .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : datinc ] , where the low redshift cumulative cluster temperature function is shown as a stepped line along with that from the high - z sample , calculated assuming that @xmath4 and ignoring the incompleteness correction .",
    "the points represent the data used for the quantitative comparison with the models , and they include the correction factor which only has any significant effect on the lowest temperature measurement .",
    "the @xmath39 uncertainties on the number densities come from a bootstrap resampling procedure using @xmath72 catalogues .",
    "given that the cumulative cluster number density varies rapidly with temperature , uncertainties in either the mass - to - temperature conversion or in the observed temperatures of individual clusters will impact more on the results than any minor incompleteness .",
    "these effects can both be modelled by smoothing the model temperature function before it is compared with observational data .",
    "the width of the smoothing function , which has been taken to be a gaussian , has been estimated by adding the fractional uncertainties from the two sources in quadrature . from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] , the scatter in individual cluster @xmath20 values is slightly less than @xmath31 per cent and it appears to be independent of redshift for @xmath73 . while these simulations were of an @xmath74 , @xmath75 model , in the absence of information to the contrary , this scatter is assumed to apply to other cosmological models as well .",
    "for both observational redshift ranges , the temperature uncertainties are sufficiently small compared to the scatter in @xmath20 , that neglecting them will not affect the final results significantly .",
    "a gaussian smoothing width of @xmath76 was therefore used . from fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] it is apparent that this correction is not negligible compared with the amount of evolution that the @xmath4 model predicts .",
    "however , if the width of the smoothing gaussian is similar for both the high- and low - redshift samples , then the amount of evolution is largely unaffected because the cumulative temperature function is almost a power law .",
    "the estimate of @xmath15 will be decreased slightly by this effect .",
    "compared with the rapid evolution in the number of clusters at a particular temperature , fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] illustrates how little the temperature at a fixed number density evolves , and how important any evolution in the mass - temperature relation is over this range of redshifts .",
    "= 9.0 cm    the best - fitting parameter set ( @xmath0 , @xmath16 , @xmath15 ) was found by minimising @xmath1 for the models calculated at five and three temperatures in the low- and high - redshift bins respectively .",
    "bin temperatures were chosen to be far apart , in order to reduce the correlations between the different points .",
    "nevertheless , the full covariance matrix was employed when calculating the @xmath1 values .",
    "the number of bins used was the minimum for which the results of the model fitting were found to be robust to the exact positioning of the bins .",
    "if any fewer bins are taken , then the results depend upon their chosen temperatures .",
    "this is particularly so for the low - redshift data where the observed function is less smooth than in the high - redshift case .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in the best - fitting parameters were quantified using both the change in @xmath1 and the distribution of best - fitting values from the @xmath72 bootstrap catalogues that were created from the observational data .",
    "the @xmath1 minimisation gave rise to the following best - fitting parameter values : @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath5 and @xmath80 , @xmath78 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "in the latter case , two different effects act in opposite directions on the most likely value of @xmath0 compared to the @xmath5 case . if @xmath83 is non - zero , then the expected amount of evolution at a particular @xmath0 increases because of the more rapidly changing growth factor",
    ". however , the volume surveyed between redshifts @xmath84 and @xmath57 also increases if a @xmath82 term is included , and this has the effect of decreasing the observed cluster number density at high - redshift relative to the low - redshift measurement .",
    "given that the most likely @xmath0 decreases , albeit only slightly , when @xmath83 is assumed to be non - zero , the former effect is the more important .",

    "[ fig : bestfit ] .",

    "only a few lay outside the ` @xmath87 ' contours , having @xmath0 values slightly larger than would be expected given these two figures . however , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : bfhist ] , there are nevertheless very few catalogues favouring @xmath91 .",
    "this provides some reassurance that the @xmath85 contours are not providing a misleading impression of the statistical uncertainties in the various parameters , despite the low number of clusters per bin .",
    "one drawback of the method presented in the previous section is that the precise cluster redshifts are not employed and so the modelling ignores any evolution within the redshift ranges spanned by the two data sets . in this section ,",
    "details are given of a maximum likelihood technique that has been applied to determine the most likely model for producing the measured values of cluster temperatures and redshifts .",
    "this has the benefit over the previous method that no particular binning in temperature is required and that the individual cluster redshifts are used .",
    "the disadvantage is that the measured cluster fluxes are not included in the scheme , and additional assumptions about the cluster luminosities need to be made .",

    "a comparison of _ cnoc _ ( carlberg , yee & ellingson 1997a ) with _ emss _ ( henry 1992 ) redshifts suggests that the low probability can not be accounted for by redshift measurement errors .",
    "if the maximum redshift limit of the henry ( 1997 ) cluster sample is decreased from @xmath57 to @xmath129 and the likelihoods are recomputed then the resulting @xmath0 becomes @xmath130 ( the best - fitting @xmath15 is at least @xmath131 , which is the largest value considered on the grid of likelihoods ) .",

    "table  1 contains a summary of the main pros and cons of these approaches .",
    "the main drawback with the first two methods , which is not so important for the order statistics approach , is the need for a statistically well - defined sample of data with well - understood selection effects .",
    "given such observational catalogues , the particular data that are used by the @xmath1 and maximum likelihood ( m.l . )",
    "techniques differ somewhat . in the former case ,",
    "only the cluster temperatures and fluxes are important .",
    "the @xmath133 estimator enables this method to sidestep the need for any cluster luminosity - temperature relation , apart from a minor incompleteness correction .",
    "however , the redundancy of the individual redshift measurements , other than to determine if a cluster should be included in the ` high- ' or  low-z temperature function , leaves a certain freedom to choose what redshifts to assign to the fits .",
    "the choice of temperature bins is also something that can alter the resulting @xmath0 determination to a small extent .",
    "in contrast , the m.l .",
    "method uses all the cluster temperatures and redshifts and avoids awkward binning problems .",
    "however , the limits of integration in equation  ( [ like ] ) , coming from the adopted ranges in @xmath11 and @xmath93 , do create some freedom in the most likely parameters .",
    "this comes as a result both of the peculiar redshift distribution of the high - z clusters , and the uncertainties in the selection functions at the extreme temperatures and redshifts .",
    "additionally , the price paid for not using the measured flux values is that one must adopt a luminosity - temperature relation ( at all relevant redshifts ) and any error in the assumed form of this relation will introduce a systematic error into the estimated @xmath0 .    the difference between the derived best - fitting parameters from the @xmath1 and m.l .",
    "techniques has non - negligible contributions from the systematic uncertainties mentioned in the previous paragraph . looking at the situation more positively , it is perhaps reassuring that , despite the various differences between the two methods , such similar results were returned .    an opportunity to win the jackpot",
    "is offered by the order statistics method ; namely the chance to rule out @xmath4 with observations of only a few very hot and distant clusters . however , the size of the payout for an apparently successful data set is not yet well - defined because of the uncertainties in both the cluster mass function evolution and the mass - temperature conversion for such rare objects at such high redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , these are both eminently measureable using numerical simulations , and the hubble volume simulation performed by the virgo consortium ( evrard in preparation ) should address the former of these issues in the near future .",
    "it is worth noting that the potential non - virialisation of large mass concentrations at high redshifts , or the boosting in emission - weighted temperature coming from a recent merger event should not cause any difficulties for this method .",
    "this is because such effects are included in hydrodynamical simulations and would be calibrated through the mean @xmath20 and the scatter around this value .",
    "given that all ` right - minded ' cosmologists _ know _ that @xmath4 , a pertinent question to ask at this point , on their behalf , is `` what has gone wrong ? '' , what would it need for an @xmath4 model to be more favoured by cluster evolution . in this section ,",
    "consideration is given to the magnitudes of the errors that are required in some of the preceeding assumptions .",
    "if @xmath0 is in fact unity , then it is very probable that at least one of the observations or the model used above is wrong .",
    "the first of these possibilities seems unlikely .",
    "an @xmath4 model would require a systematic overestimation of the high - redshift cluster temperatures by _ asca _ of about @xmath38 per cent , or a corresponding underestimation of the low - redshift temperatures by this same amount .",
    "this corresponds to a shift in all of the cluster temperatures that is typically twice the quoted uncertainty and , as such , seems highly unlikely .",
    "having said that , the analysis of _ asca _ data by markevitch ( 1998 ) showed , for single temperature fits to @xmath32 of the original @xmath38 ha91 clusters , an average @xmath134 per cent increase in the measured temperatures . while this is not sufficiently large , if such a systematic shift were applied to the entire low - redshift temperature function , then the most likely @xmath0 would increase by @xmath135 per cent .",
    "contamination of the x - ray emission by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or cooling flows would alter the mass - temperature conversion .",
    "the effect of agn contamination is to increase the emission - weighted temperature .",
    "cooling flows have the opposite effect .",
    "these potential complications are better addressed from the point of view of decontaminating the data , rather than adding extra processes into the numerical simulations , so will be considered as ` observational ' problems .",
    "the likelihood of any interloping agn in the high - redshift sample is very low , and high - resolution images show no evidence for such contamination .",
    "more important is the effect of cooling flows on the two different redshift samples .",
    "if cooling flows were more prevalent in the low - redshift sample than the high - redshift one , then their removal would result in an increased separation of the two temperature functions , thus favouring higher @xmath0 . by fitting both single - temperature and two isothermal models",
    "to _ asca _ data , markevitch ( 1998 ) showed that , for the @xmath32 low - z clusters in common with ha91 , the decontaminated emission - weighted temperature is , on average , @xmath134 per cent larger than the single - temperature value .",
    "for the most discrepant single cluster , the effect was @xmath43 times as great .",
    "allen ( 1998 ) performs a similar analysis including two of the henry ( 1997 ) ( high - z ) clusters , and finds the temperatures increase by @xmath32 and @xmath136 per cent when a cool component is removed .",
    "there are two simple reasons why one might expect cooling flows to be more prominent in the _ emss _ high - z sample rather than the ha91 catalogue .",
    "firstly the densities are larger and hence cooling times are shorter in the higher redshift range . secondly , the _ emss _ selection algorithm tends to favour clusters that have centrally peaked emission , with only those exceeding a flux threshold in a @xmath137 detect cell being included in the catalogue .",
    "if the results from allen ( 1998 ) are typical of the whole henry ( 1997 ) sample , then the effect of cooling flow decontamination would be to increase the high - redshift cluster temperatures by more than the low - redshift ones .",
    "this would somewhat overcompensate for the systematic temperature shift described in the previous paragraph , leading to an overall estimate of @xmath0 that is about @xmath31 per cent lower than the value found in section  [ sec : maxl ] , where these considerations were neglected . as was discussed in section  [ sec : maxl ] , a @xmath29 per cent incompleteness in the low - redshift sample only increases @xmath0 by @xmath138 , so this is not a sufficiently large effect to help the critical density model .",
    "independent checks are available on the sample completenesses .",
    "these come from the comparison of luminosity functions obtained from the cluster catalogues used here with those from the larger _ rosat _ cluster samples at low ( ebeling 1997 ) and high ( rosati 1998 ) redshifts .",
    "_ rosat _ does not detect enough very luminous clusters to compare with the majority of the luminosity range of the _ emss _ high - z sample , because of the smaller fraction of sky it surveyed . nevertheless , where an overlap in luminosity exists , there is agreement between the cluster abundances in the different surveys .",
    "these comparisons have enough statistical uncertainty to make them reassuring rather than highly restrictive .",
    "there could still plausibly be @xmath139 per cent difference between the various samples . in order to favour @xmath4 though",
    ", there would need to be a significantly greater incompleteness in the low - redshift sample than exists in the more distant one , and this seems unlikely .",
    "the considerations in the preceeding few paragraphs suggest that if anything , relative to the results found in sections  [ sec : evol ] and  [ sec : maxl ] , lower rather than higher values of @xmath0 would be favoured by the potential ` observational ' systematic effects .",
    "thus , if the data used in this paper are the product of an @xmath4 universe then it seems that the finger of suspicion should point firmly in the direction of the modelling of cluster evolution .",
    "while the statement that the press - schechter expression provides a good description of the mass function of galaxy - cluster - sized objects had stood up to much scrutiny , the recent report by tozzi & governato ( 1997 ) suggests that it overestimates the actual evolution for @xmath4 .",
    "their simulation is of a cube with side @xmath140 and thus allows the evolution of very rare objects to be traced back to higher redshifts than was possible with the smaller volumes used in previous studies .",
    "these authors suggest that the spherical collapse threshold @xmath141 should be replaced by @xmath142 .",
    "this result appears to be slightly discrepant with previous findings where comparison is possible , but it may be that this is just an artefact of the groupfinder that was employed ( see cole & lacey 1996 for more details ) . nevertheless , it is worthwhile to investigate the possibility that an evolving threshold is required . assuming that @xmath143 is the form of @xmath141 that is applicable to all @xmath5 models ( similar redshift evolution is found in a large @xmath74 cdm simulation ; governato , private communication ) , the effect of such a varying threshold on the most likely value of @xmath0 can be investigated using the likelihood procedure described in section  [ sec : maxl ] .",
    "the resulting marginalised likelihoods are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : delteff ] .",
    "= 8.5 cm    it is apparent that , whilst the most likely value of @xmath0 has only increased to @xmath144 , the @xmath145ln@xmath146 required to reach @xmath4 is now just @xmath147 , only @xmath148 . whilst this gives the impression that a small hit has been scored on the good ship @xmath149",
    ", the captain might retaliate by pointing out that the _ emss _ survey found clusters with @xmath132 and , given that the tozzi & governato @xmath143 fitted their simulated mass function out to a redshift of one , these distant objects can now be included in the likelihood calculation .",
    "temperatures have yet to be measured for all of these clusters , but they do have known redshifts , so an additional contribution to the likelihood is computed by replacing the @xmath150 in equation  ( [ like ] ) by the integral of @xmath150 over all cluster temperatures ( @xmath151  kev in practice ) and just comparing the probability of finding clusters at the observed redshifts . additionally , the value of @xmath152 is taken to be @xmath153 , independent of redshift for the @xmath132 _ emss _ clusters .",
    "the @xmath154 is a point source ( see henry 1998 ) and it is not included . ]",
    "identified _ emss _ clusters with @xmath132 and their corresponding redshifts are taken from gioia & luppino ( 1994 ) and luppino & gioia ( 1995 ) , and the marginalised likelihoods resulting from their inclusion are shown in fig .  [ fig : delteff2 ] .",
    "it should be noted that there are also @xmath154 unidentified _ emss _ sources ( gioia & luppino 1994 ) , some of which might contribute to this list , and consequently reduce the estimated value of @xmath0 from that found here .",
    "the most likely parameters change only slightly , becoming @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of the more distant clusters significantly decreases the sizes of the statistical uncertainties on the most likely parameters , such that @xmath4 is now excluded at a higher confidence level than was the case with the original default assumptions , despite the favourably evolving @xmath143 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    distributions of the numbers of clusters marginalised with respect to either redshift or temperature are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delteff3 ] . as the temperatures have yet to be measured for the highest redshift clusters , this model ` prediction '",
    "is shown as a dotted line .",
    "= 12.0 cm    in addition to any uncertainties in the accuracy of the press - schechter description of the mass function , there is some leeway in the conversion from mass to temperature that may effect the most likely @xmath0 .",
    "there are at least @xmath43 options for tinkering in an attempt to salvage @xmath4 :    \\1 .",
    "evolution of the scatter in both the cluster mass - temperature conversion and the observational temperatures would give rise to a systematic error in the estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "it has been assumed that the intrinsic scatter is unchanging and the low- and high - redshift temperature errors are similar ( which the quoted values suggest they are ) .",
    "if these scatters at high redshift implied that a gaussian smoothing width of @xmath158 rather than @xmath76 was appropriate , then even the @xmath4 model cluster temperature function would appear not to evolve .",
    "however , for the mass - temperature relation , the low-@xmath0 simulations of eke ( 1998 ) show no significant evolution in the scatter over this range of redshifts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : beta ] ) .",
    "the observational uncertainties are relatively small and , only slightly larger for the high-@xmath11 sample .",
    "the conclusion is therefore that such an escape for @xmath4 is not easily arranged .",
    "evolution of @xmath159 , the mean molecular weight of the intracluster gas , has been ignored in the modelling .",
    "if it were @xmath38 per cent larger at @xmath160 than @xmath161 then the model predictions for @xmath4 would show no evolution over this redshift range .",
    "this change in @xmath159 is both extreme and in a counter - intuitive direction .",
    "mushotzky & loewenstein ( 1997 ) recently used _ asca _ data to show that the iron abundance in the intracluster medium ( icm ) does not evolve over the range @xmath162 .",
    "also , kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) adopted a semi - analytical approach to the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies , concluding that the metallicity of the icm is approximately constant out to @xmath163 .",
    "this approach for saving @xmath4 can be ruled out .",
    "evolution of @xmath20 to the extent described for @xmath159 in point 2 , would also make @xmath4 compatible with the observations .",
    "the definition of @xmath20 is such that it would need to be @xmath38 per cent _ smaller _ at the larger redshift . as shown by the simulations of eke ( 1998 ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : beta ] ) this amount of evolution is difficult to justify and , if anything , the @xmath20 at @xmath160 is a few per cent larger than that at low redshift . for the various cosmologies studied numerically by bryan & norman ( 1998 ) ,",
    "a similar lack of evolution was also found ( see their figure  @xmath71 ) .",
    "this suggests that such a route will not assist @xmath4 models either , and that the most likely value for @xmath0 quoted here may be slightly biased to a value that is too large .",
    "one clear deficiency of the hydrodynamical simulations that have been used to relate virial mass to emission - weighted x - ray temperature is the lack of any heating of the intracluster gas by supernovae . that this is a problem becomes apparent when the simulated cluster luminosity - temperature relation is compared with the observed one .",
    "whilst the models and scaling laws show @xmath164 , the observations suggest a steeper dependence of luminosity on temperature ( see equation  ( [ ltmean01 ] ) ) .",
    "allen & fabian ( 1998 ) find that decontaminating the cooling flow contribution to the x - ray emission can leave @xmath165 .",
    "however , a similar study by markevitch ( 1998 ) implies that , in order to produce this shallow slope , some feedback is still necessary after the cooling flow correction has been applied .",
    "nfw showed that by preheating gas in the manner suggested by evrard & henry ( 1991 ) , the low - temperature simulated clusters could be warmed up enough , along with the corresponding decrease in luminosity as a result of the less dense cores , to produce a sufficiently steep luminosity - temperature relation to match observations . to obtain a very crude idea of the maximum extent to which such a change will affect the evolution of the @xmath4 temperature functions ,",
    "a simple mapping of temperature has been applied to the no - preheating value , @xmath166 , to give a ` feedback ' temperature , @xmath167 .",
    "the mapping that has been adopted is @xmath168    = 9.0 cm    this route for converting the simulated clusters to lie on the observed luminosity - temperature relation is extreme in its effect on the cluster temperatures . in practice , one would expect any energy injection to heat the gas _ and _ decrease the central density . as a result",
    ", the simulated clusters would fall onto the observed @xmath169 relation more as a result of decreasing luminosity than increasing temperature as is assumed for the mapping above . figure  [ fig : feed ]",
    "shows the predictions before and after ` feedback ' when the same distortion is applied to both high- and low - redshift models . with the ` feedback ' essentially just heating the cooler clusters , it produces steeper cumulative temperature functions , thus favouring lower @xmath16 values .",
    "( it is worth noting that , if the lower temperature clusters were preferentially contaminated by cooling flows then the estimated @xmath16 would be biased low , but markevitch ( 1998 ) reports that slightly the reverse is seen in his sample of nearby clusters . )",
    "interestingly , the extreme feedback simulations of metzler & evrard ( 1994 ) increased the gas temperature of a @xmath170  kev cluster by @xmath171 per cent .",
    "this size of fractional change is only reached with the above mapping for clusters cooler than @xmath172  kev . despite all of this ,",
    "the predicted amount of evolution still exceeds that observed .",
    "only if such a prescription were proscribed for the high - redshift sample alone would feedback be effective in reducing the amount of evolution seen in @xmath4 models .",
    "the effects of having a two - phase intracluster gas medium or magnetic fields are also lacking from the hydrodynamical simulations used to normalise the mass - temperature relation . while it seems unlikely that they should have a different effect on the two redshift ranges considered here , they could still bias the best - fitting parameters as was illustrated in section  [ sec : maxl ] , by shifting a different part of the mass function into the observed range of temperatures .",
    "the amount by which @xmath20 can be affected is roughly constrained by comparisons between weak lensing masses and x - ray masses .",
    "present results ( smail 1997 ; allen 1998 ) appear to imply that this additional physics is not sufficiently misleading to allow @xmath4 to be consistent with the lack of evolution of the cluster number density .",
    "in this paper , the value of the density parameter @xmath0 has been constrained using three different , yet similar , methods .",
    "the results are entirely consistent with those presented by henry ( 1997 ) .",
    "combining the results from sections  [ sec : evol ] and  [ sec : maxl ] gives the most likely parameters as @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 if @xmath5 .",
    "the inclusion of a non - zero cosmological constant term has very little effect , leading to @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "apart from the difficulty arising because of the redshift distribution of the henry ( 1997 ) sample , none of the systematic effects that have been considered alter the best - fitting @xmath0 by more than one of the statistical standard deviations quoted above . unless an important systematic error or uncertainty has been overlooked in the analysis , these results would appear to be limited by a lack of data , so , while this preliminary study suggests that the @xmath4 model is still bobbing about unhappily in the water at a rejection level of @xmath179 , a larger sample of clusters would offer the opportunity , with this method alone , to sink it properly .",
