    "surface growth processes and deposition of thin films have attracted much interest from the technological point of view  @xcite and motivated the proposal of continuum and discrete models for surface and interface growth , which also play an important role in the field of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "one of the most important phenomenological theories is that of kardar , parisi and zhang ( kpz )  @xcite , in which the time evolution of the interface described by the height function @xmath14 at position @xmath15 and time @xmath16 is given by the kpz equation @xmath17 here @xmath18 represents a surface tension , @xmath5 represents the excess velocity and @xmath19 is a gaussian noise  @xcite with zero mean and variance @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the dimension of the substrate .",
    "the interface width @xmath22 characterizes the roughness of the interface , for growth in a substrate of length @xmath23 ( overbars denote spatial averages and angular brackets denote configurational averages ) . for short times , the interface width scales as @xmath24 with @xmath25 called the roughness exponent . for long times , a steady state is attained and the width saturates at @xmath26 with @xmath27 called the roughness exponent . eqs .",
    "( [ defbeta ] ) and ( [ defalpha ] ) correspond to limits of the dynamical scaling relation of family and vicsek  @xcite @xmath28 where the dynamical exponent @xmath13 characterizes the crossover from the growth regime to the steady state .",
    "galilean invariance gives @xmath12 for kpz in all dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the exact scaling exponents are known in @xmath29 , but no exact value was already obtained in two or more dimensions  @xcite .",
    "many discrete models fall into the kpz class , such as the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model of kim and kosterlitz  @xcite and ballistic deposition ( bd )  @xcite .",
    "numerical estimates of the scaling exponents in @xmath29 are consistent with the exact values  @xcite and simulations in @xmath30 are frequently used to estimate them .",
    "most of the reported values of @xmath27 range from @xmath31 to @xmath32  @xcite , which is confirmed by numerical solutions of the kpz equation  @xcite .    in 1998 , assuming certain properties of the height correlation functions , lssig obtained a quantization condition for the kpz exponents which gave @xmath33 as the only solution consistent with the range of numerical estimates  @xcite .",
    "another consequence of his work was that the moments of the steady state height distribution , @xmath34 would obey power - counting , i. e. they would scale as @xmath35 .",
    "the second moment is the squared interface width @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , the validity of his assumptions requires that the steady state distribution is skewed ( non - zero third moment ) , contrary to the one - dimensional case ( gaussian distribution ) .",
    "recent numerical results of chin and den nijs for the rsos and the body - centered solid - on - solid ( bcsos ) models were consistent with @xmath32  @xcite , but extensive simulations of marinari et al for the rsos model rule out that value  @xcite . a recent study of the kpz equation in the mode - coupling approximation provided an estimate @xmath37 in @xmath30  @xcite . despite this controversy",
    ", various works  @xcite confirm the power - counting property for models with restricted height differences ( rsos , bcsos ) and suggest that the skewness @xmath38 and the kurtosis @xmath39 are universal at the steady state . according to chin and den nijs",
    ", these universal values do not depend on the sign of the coefficient @xmath5 of the nonlinear term of the kpz equation ( [ kpz ] ) .",
    "consequently , the value of kpz exponents in @xmath30 is still an open question , and the universality of the values of the skewness and the kurtosis deserves to be tested in models other than those with restricted height differences .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the analysis of simulations results of a recently proposed model for etching of crystalline solids  @xcite which belongs to the kpz class .",
    "additional support to some of our conclusions will be provided by simulations results of ballistic deposition and of the temperature - dependent bcsos model  @xcite . for the etching model ,",
    "we will obtain @xmath40 after a detailed analysis of finite - size corrections .",
    "characteristic relaxation times will be calculated independently and will provide estimates of the dynamical exponent @xmath41 , while estimates of the growth exponent give @xmath42 .",
    "although our error bars intercept those obtained from extensive simulations of the rsos model  @xcite , our central estimates of @xmath27 are smaller and , consequently , more distant from the theoretically proposed value @xmath32  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our estimates are near those by colaiori and moore  @xcite from renormalization under the mode - coupling approximation .",
    "we will also show that our data for various models confirm the universality of the steady state skewness and kurtosis . concerning the steady state skewness , although its absolute value is universal , its sign changes with the nonlinear coefficient @xmath5 of the kpz equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe the models , the simulation procedure , the methods to estimate @xmath1 and the method to calculate characteristic relaxation times . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the skewness and the kurtosis at the steady states . in sec .",
    "iv , we analyze the finite - size estimates of the scaling exponents of the etching model , also showing some results for bd . in sec .",
    "v we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the model for etching of a crystalline solid of mello et al  @xcite is illustrated in fig . 1 in its growth version .",
    "the solids have square and simple cubic lattice structures in @xmath43 and @xmath0 dimensions , respectively . at each growth attempt ,",
    "a column @xmath44 , with current height @xmath45 , is randomly chosen .",
    "then its height is increased by one unit ( @xmath46 ) and any neighboring column whose height is smaller than @xmath47 grows until its height becomes @xmath47 .",
    "one time unit corresponds to @xmath48 growth attempts in @xmath0 dimensions . in the true etching version of this model , the columns heights decrease by the same quantities above",
    "however , in this paper we will always refer to the growth version of fig . 1 as `` the etching model '' .    in the ballistic deposition ( bd ) model ,",
    "particles are sequentially released from randomly chosen positions above the substrate , follow a trajectory perpendicular to the surface and stick upon first contact with a nearest neighbor occupied site  @xcite .    in the bcsos model defined by chin and den nijs  @xcite",
    ", the substrate is a square lattice and the heights @xmath14 in the first ( second ) sublattice are restricted to assume even ( odd ) values .",
    "also , the nearest neighbor columns always differ in height by @xmath49 .",
    "the energy of a given heights configuration @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is an inverse temperature parameter and the sum runs over all next nearest neighbor pairs . at each deposition attempt ,",
    "a column @xmath53 is randomly chosen and , if the constraint of the heights difference is satisfied , then @xmath54 with probability @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the energy change if the deposition takes place . the corresponding coefficient @xmath5 ( eq . [ kpz ] ) changes sign at a critical point @xmath57  @xcite",
    ".    the etching model was simulated in lattices of lengths @xmath58 ( @xmath59 to @xmath60 ) and lattices of lengths @xmath61 ( @xmath62 to @xmath63 ) .",
    "the maximum deposition time ranged from @xmath64 for the smallest lattices to @xmath65 for the largest ones . during half of this time or more ,",
    "the systems have undoubtedly attained their steady states . for the smallest lattices",
    ", @xmath66 realizations were simulated , and nearly @xmath67 realizations for the largest lattices ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "bd was simulated in lattices of lengths @xmath58 , from @xmath59 ( @xmath70 ) to @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) . for the analysis of the skewness and of the kurtosis",
    ", it was essential to simulate this model in very large lattices , thus the number of realizations was relatively small : typically @xmath64 realizations for @xmath73 , @xmath74 for @xmath69 and @xmath75 for @xmath72 .",
    "the temperature - dependent bcsos model was simulated with @xmath76 ( @xmath77 to @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 ( @xmath77 to @xmath80 ) .",
    "for @xmath81 , @xmath64 different realizations were considered , and @xmath82 realizations for @xmath80 .",
    "the procedure to calculate average quantities , described below , followed the same lines for all models .",
    "it was previously used in the analysis of other growth models in @xmath43 and @xmath0 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "one important point is the criterion to determine the initial time @xmath83 for estimating average quantities at the steady state . in this regime",
    ", the interface width @xmath84 fluctuates around an average value instead of increasing systematically , which was the case in the growth and in the crossover regions .",
    "thus , for a fixed lattice length @xmath23 , the first step was choosing a time interval @xmath85 , with nearly constant @xmath84 , from visual inspection of the @xmath86 plot ( @xmath87 was always the maximum simulation time ) .",
    "subsequently , two tests were performed .",
    "for the first test , the interval was divided in @xmath88 subintervals and the average value of @xmath84 was calculated in each one , forming a sequence of estimates @xmath89 , with @xmath90 . if @xmath91 at least two times along this sequence , then the average value of @xmath84 in the region @xmath85 , @xmath92 , was calculated . in the second test , from the plot of @xmath93 , for @xmath16 in the crossover region , we obtained a rough estimate of the characteristic time @xmath94 of relaxation to the steady state , as shown in ref .",
    "if @xmath95 , then the interval @xmath85 was accepted as representative of the steady state . otherwise , a larger value of @xmath83 was chosen and the tests were repeated ( it seldom occurred ) .    in order to estimate the moments of the height distribution and their error bars , we used their average values within the five subintervals defined above .",
    "final estimates of @xmath1 are averages of these values , and error bars were obtained from their variances .",
    "the dynamical exponent was estimated using a recently proposed method  @xcite , in which a characteristic time @xmath96 , proportional to the relaxation time @xmath94 , is calculated . for fixed @xmath23 , after calculating the saturation width @xmath97 , @xmath96 is defined through @xmath98 with a constant @xmath99 . from relation ( [ fv ] ) , we obtain @xmath100 typically , the uncertainty in @xmath96 is much smaller than that of @xmath94 , estimated from @xmath101 plots - see ref . @xcite .",
    "we estimated @xmath96 with @xmath102 ranging from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "although these constants are not much different , the values of @xmath96 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 typically differ by a factor @xmath105 , for fixed @xmath23 .",
    "this method was already applied with success to calculate the dynamical exponent of other models in various universality classes  @xcite .",
    "in fig . 2a we show the steady state skewness @xmath106 of the etching model as a function of the inverse lattice length , which provides a good linear fit of the data , with an asymptotic estimate @xmath107 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath108 agrees with results of chin and den nijs  @xcite , shim and landau  @xcite and marinari et al  @xcite for the rsos model of kim and kosterlitz  @xcite and for bcsos models , but those authors obtained @xmath108 with negative sign . here , the positive sign is related to the presence of sharp hills ( see process at the left in fig . 1 ) and wide valleys at the surface of the deposit , the opposite being observed in rsos deposits .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ kpz ] ) is invariant under the transformations @xmath109 and @xmath110 , without changing the other parameters .",
    "this transformation changes the sign of the skewness .",
    "consequently , we expect that the sign of @xmath108 is related to that of @xmath5 , as previously observed in the growth regimes of @xmath43-dimensional kpz systems  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the true etching version of this model , with erosion leading to decreasing heights , the sign of @xmath108 changes , corresponding to the transformation @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "results for the other models contribute to this discussion . in fig .",
    "2b we show @xmath106 versus @xmath111 for the bd model . note that @xmath108 is negative for small lattices ( typically @xmath112 ) , but for large lattices it becomes positive , showing that there are significant morphological differences between the steady states of small lattices and those of very large systems .",
    "this is the main reason to avoid extrapolating the data in fig .",
    "2b , even choosing extrapolation variables other than that @xmath111 ( this abscissa in fig .",
    "2b was chosen only for illustrate the evolution of @xmath108 with @xmath23 ) .",
    "other consequences of this complex finite - size behavior were previously discussed in ref .",
    "however , it is clear from fig . 2b",
    "that @xmath108 is asymptotically positive .    in figs . 2c and 2d we show the steady state skewness for the temperature - dependent bcsos models with @xmath76 and @xmath79 , respectively . for @xmath76 , the extrapolation of the three last data points give @xmath113 , reinforcing the conclusion on the universality of @xmath114 . due to the small number of data points ,",
    "the asymptotic correction term may be other than @xmath111 , but it would not affect that conclusion . for @xmath79 , the skewness is always positive and rapidly increases with @xmath23 , thus no extrapolation variable of the form @xmath115 , with @xmath116 , provides a reasonable linear fit .",
    "however , @xmath108 will certainly converge to a positive value as @xmath117 , showing that the sign of the steady state skewness changes as @xmath52 increases .",
    "the sign of the corresponding parameter @xmath5 is obtained from the size dependence of the growth velocity .",
    "the steady state growth velocity , @xmath118 , and the velocity in an infinitely large substrate at long times , @xmath119 , obey the relation  @xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 is positive . considering @xmath123 ( see sec .",

    "it confirms that the steady state skewness of the kpz equation has the same sign of the parameter @xmath5 , its absolute value being universal .",
    "the same conclusion was derived from the time dependence of the velocity in the growth regime  @xcite .    at this point",
    ", we recall that chin and den nijs  @xcite simulated the temperature - dependent bcsos model with @xmath128 and @xmath76 , obtaining @xmath129 in both cases . they concluded that @xmath108 did not depend on @xmath5 , but they did not estimate the values of this parameter . since @xmath5 is expected to cross zero for a positive @xmath52 , we conclude that their work failed to consider the regime of positive @xmath5 , which is represented here by @xmath79 .",
    "now we turn to the analysis of the kurtosis ( eq . [ defkurt ] ) . in fig .",
    "4a we show the steady state @xmath130 for the etching model , as a function of @xmath111 .",
    "the size dependence is much weaker than that of the skewness , so that extrapolation variables other than @xmath111 do not have a significant influence on the asymptotic estimate , @xmath7 ( the large error bar is mainly a consequence of the uncertainties of the finite - size data ) .",

    "thus , the extrapolated values have very large error bars , but are still consistent with a universal value of @xmath130 .",

    "since the range of lattice lengths considered here is not very large and the correction exponents @xmath147 estimated above are relatively small , we tried to improve our analysis with a different assumption for the scaling corrections .",
