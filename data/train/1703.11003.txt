    "in the 80 years since the seminal 1935 einstein - podolsky - rosen paper ( epr)@xcite , physicists and philosophers have mused about what einstein referred to as  spooky action at a distance \" .",
    "bell s 1964 analysis of an epr - type experiment ,  on the einstein podolsky rosen paradox\"@xcite , has been cited more than 10,000 times and most of these have been in the last decade .",
    "many of these describe experimental work on testing quantum mechanical predictions related to entangled states and , as an experimentalist , i have great admiration for much of this work . on the other hand",
    "many , if not most , of the remainder are theoretical and philosophical papers trying to come to grips with what is often referred to as the nonlocality of quantum mechanics . according to david mermin @xcite , physicists views of bell s theorem fall  between the majority position of near indifference and the minority position of wild extravagance . \" at the  wild extravagance \" extreme is , perhaps , henry stapp who pronounced ,  bell s theorem is the most profound discovery of science.\"@xcite mermin advocates a balanced position between these two extremes .",
    "a distinguished princeton physicist ( arthur wightman ? ) concurred with mermin s view but added ,  anybody who s not bothered by bell s theorem has to have rocks in his head.\"@xcite .",
    "my view also lies in this middle ground but , i suspect , is closer to  near indifference \" than mermin s .",
    "bell s theorem provides a general test , in the form of an inequality , that the results of an epr type gedanken experiment must satisfy if it is describable by any classical theory , even one with hidden variables , so long as such a model is locally causal .",
    "bell then proceeded to demonstrate how the predictions of quantum mechanics violate this inequality .",
    "his conclusion was that any hidden variable theory designed to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics must necessarily be nonlocal and allow superluminal interactions . in bell",

    "a large class of local hidden variable theories were immediately ruled out . on the other hand , a demonstration of a violation of bell s inequality certainly does not immediately imply that nonlocality is a characteristic feature of quantum mechanics let alone a fundamental property of nature .",
    "nevertheless , many physicists and philosophers of science do harbor this belief .",
    "in fact , bell later described the violation of his inequalities as pointing to thegross nonlocality of nature\"@xcite .",
    "statements like  if one assumes the world to be real , then bell - experiments have proven that it is nonlocal\"@xcite and  bell s theorem asserts that if certain predictions of quantum theory are correct then our world is nonlocal ... experiments thus establish that our world is nonlocal\"@xcite abound in scientific publications , and especially in popular literature .",
    "experts in the field often use the term  nonlocality \" to designate particular non - classical aspects of quantum entanglement and do not confuse the term with superluminal interactions . however , many physicists and philosophers seem to take the term more literally .    for me",
    "the term _ nonlocality _ is so fraught with misinterpretation that i feel we d all be better off if it were removed from discourse on quantum mechanics .",
    "i confess that i m neither a theoretical physicist nor a philosopher but rather an experimental physicist and observational astronomer and it s from this vantage point that i ll try to convince you that quantum mechanics does not require spooky action at a distance of any kind and will then tell you to what i attribute the magic of quantum mechanical entanglement . but",
    "first , a brief review of quantum entanglement and why this phenomenon has led to claims of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics .",
    "consider two microscopic quantum systems , _ a _ and _ b _ , that interact with each other and then fly off in opposite directions . according to quantum mechanics , the results of measurements made on _",
    "a _ will be correlated with those made on _",
    "b_. furthermore , by changing the experimental arrangement used to observe subsystem _ a _ , the correlations with the results of the measurements on remote subsystem _ b _ will also change .",
    "the seemingly plausible implication is that the results of the measurements on _ b _ directly depend on the choice of measurements made on _ a _ independent of the distance between the two .",
    "this simple argument is specious , as will be clarified shortly . to be sure , bell s demonstration that any classical , hidden variable treatment of the system demands acausal , superluminal signals provides sufficient grounds to summarily dismiss such classically based models",
    "however , to turn the argument around and assert the nonlocality of nature is not justified .",
    "so how are the arguments for the nonlocality of quantum mechanics ( and nature ) constructed ?",
    "there are a plethora of points of view in the literature .",
    "i offer the following two simply to provide counterpoint to my subsequent account .",
    "physicist / philosopher abner shimony puts it like this@xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ locality is a condition on composite systems with spatially separated constituents , requiring an operator which is the product of operators associated with the individual constituents to be assigned a value which is the product of the values assigned to the factors , and requiring the value assigned to an operator associated with an individual constituent to be independent of what is measured on any other constituent .",

    "b_. i know of no experimental evidence to the contrary of this principle nor does standard quantum mechanics predict any such violation .",
    "it is interesting that in the very first paragraph of his paper bell defined locality in precisely this way , i.e. ,  it is the requirement of locality or more precisely that the result of an experiment on one system be unaffected by operations on a distant system with which it has interacted in the past , that creates the essential difficulty.\"@xcite however , the  difficulty \" only presents itself when applied in conjunction with classical - type hidden variables , which are not present in ordinary quantum mechanics .    as an illustration ,",
    "consider bell s original gedanken experiment ( due to bohm and aharonov@xcite ) : the emission of two oppositely moving spin @xmath1 particles in a singlet state .",
    "their combined wave function is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 indicate the @xmath5 components of the spins of particles 1 and 2 .",

    "can also be expressed as @xmath8 then , if the spin of particle 1 is measured with a stern - gerlach apparatus oriented in the @xmath9 direction and is determined to be @xmath3 , the wave function of particle 2 collapses to @xmath10 .",
    "this violates einstein s separation principle that the measurement of particle 1 can have no effect on the _ state _ of particle 2 . yet",
    ", this scenario does not violate the experimentally motivated separation principle .",
    "if one measures particle 1 to be @xmath3 in any direction , we know the measurement of particle 2 has to be @xmath4 .",
    "this perfect ( anti)correlation is built into the two particle system because they are in a singlet state . of course one might argue , as did einstein , that the above scenario provides evidence that the result of the measurement on particle 1 _ causes _ a change in the _ state _ of particle 2 .",
    "however , this requires a precise definition of the notion of a _ state _ as well as of _",
    "cause_. if one defines _",
    "state _ as the probability distribution of possible outcomes of a measurement of particle 2 , then einstein s separation principle is the same as the experimentalist s separation principle for which there is no conflict with quantum mechanics . even if one defines _",
    "state _ in such a way that it is changed in the above scenario , the notion of a _ cause _ offers little in the way of explanation if no physical model of the cause is offered .",
    "the problem becomes a bit stickier if one measures the spin of particle 1 in an arbitrary direction @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath13 and @xmath14 in an @xmath11 basis , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath16 it is straightforward to show that the correlation of the measured components of the spins of the two particles in the @xmath11 and @xmath6 directions is given by @xmath17 ( with the spins in units of @xmath18 .",
    "that is , the correlations between the measurements of the two distant systems are changed , which may seem to be a problem for any separation principle .",
    "how is it that the original states of the two particles know about the perfect anti - correlation , this new correlation and , in fact , about every correlation of all conceivable measurements made on the two particles ?",
    "well , that s the magic of quantum mechanics but it does not violate the experimentalist separation principle .    suppose observer 1 ( the observer of particle 1 ) chooses an apparatus to measure the spin in the @xmath11 direction and that choice were somehow immediately ( superluminally ) transmitted to and affects the measurement of particle 2 in the @xmath6 direction a moment latter . if the events that define these two measurements have a space - like separation , as in the epr experiment , it is not possible for them to be unambiguously time ordered . because of their space - like separation , it is straightforward to identify another inertial observer who will claim that the observation of the spin of particle 2 occurs well before that of particle 1",
    ". then either knowledge of the choice of the experimental arrangement of observer 1 must be communicated backward in time to observer 2 , or the results of the measurement of particle 2 must be subsequently communicated to 1 and determine observer 1 s choice of the experimental arrangement .",
    "the former certainly wreaks havoc with causality while the latter seriously compromises free will .",
    "in fact , one need nt appeal to other inertial observers . within a common rest frame of the two observations , simply have the observation of 2 take place well before ( i.e. , much closer to the interaction region ) than the observation of 1 .",
    "now suppose that the result of that measurement is sent via a light signal to a third party located midway between the two observers and is recorded in a lab notebook well before observer 1 makes the choice of the direction @xmath11 .",
    "then it is absolute clear that that choice of measurement of 1 could have no possible effect on the measurement of 2 , superluminal or otherwise , as is consistent with the experimentalist separation principle .",
    "after all , the measurement of 2 is  written in stone \" before the choice of @xmath11 is made .",
    "the correlations of many such measurements will be those predicted by quantum mechanics regardless of the choice of measurements .",
    "all those correlations are built into the entangled wave function of the two particles .",
    "as for the measurements of particle 1 and 2 themselves , they have absolutely no effect on each other .",
    "there is no spooky action at a distance .",
    "okay , so how do i explain the magic of the correlations of entangled quantum mechanical systems ?",
    "first , a quick review of bell s theorem .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the correlation of spin measurements of particles 1 and 2 along the directions @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively ( bell s notation ) .",
    "then the inequality derived by bell ( roughly a one page proof ) , @xmath22 , is the condition that must be satisfied by any classical , local , hidden variable description of the hypothetical singlet spin system .",
    "suppose that @xmath21 is in the @xmath6 direction while @xmath20 and @xmath23 are in directions that are @xmath24 from the @xmath6 direction .",
    "then from the quantum mechanical correlation analysis above , bell s inequality takes the form @xmath25 , which is clearly violated for @xmath26 ( the domain of applicability of the inequality ) .",
    "the implication is that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with any classical , local , hidden variable theory .",
    "the violation of the bell inequality arises from the quantum mechanical prediction of the correlations of measurements of the spins , i.e. , @xmath27 , but this correlation arises directly from the single particle wave function .",
    "suppose a spin @xmath1 particle is in the @xmath28 state .",
    "this can be written in the @xmath11 basis as @xmath29 .",
    "now consider the correlation between a measurement of the particle s spin in the @xmath6 direction and a hypothetical measurement of the spin of the same particle in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "then @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the spin operators in the @xmath6 and @xmath11 directions .",
    "this is the same correlation as for bell s gedanken experiment except for the minus sign , which is due to the singlet state of bell s two particles .",
    "one can easily make them exactly the same simply by requiring either of the measurements to change the sign of the output .",
    "so it would _ seem _ ( more on this later ) that this hypothetical measurement also violates bell s inequality even though there is no question of nonlocality , superluminal interactions , or even entanglement .",
    "after all , there s only a single particle . of course",
    ", the measurement of the spin in the @xmath11 direction is only hypothetical because one can not simultaneously measure components corresponding to non - commuting operators .",
    "philosophers refer to the results of such a measurement as _ counterfactually definite _ , a notion that is uncontroversial in deterministic classical physics .",
    "bell s theorem clearly makes use of counterfactual definiteness ; his inequality involves the correlations of the spins of the two particles in each of two different directions that correspond to non - commuting spin components .",
    "this use of counterfactuals is entirely appropriate because it is used to investigate a test for classical hidden variable theories .",
    "even so , i realize that one might object to such a counterfactual gedanken experiment in the present single particle scenario .",
    "however , the purpose of this hypothetical experiment is to demonstrate that the resulting correlation has little to do with entanglement , nonlocality , and superluminal signals and everything to do with superposition and the nature of quantum states , whether entangled or not .",
    "one can render the counterfactual measurement to be an actual measurement by cloning the original single particle state and performing an actual measurement on the cloned state . in effect , this is precisely what bell s singlet entangled state accomplishes .",
    "in fact , one need nt couch the discussion in terms of a counterfactual measurement .",
    "suppose we simply prepare an isolated system in a @xmath28 state and then subsequently measure the spin in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the mean value of the measured spin would again be the same @xmath33 as in bell s gedanken experiment .",
    "this follows directly from the single particle decomposition in eq .",
    "bell s spin singlet system might well be considered to be a prescription for preparing such a single particle state but this in no way indicates that the remote measurement of particle 2 has any effect whatsoever on the measurement of particle 1 .",
    "the latter follows directly from the quantum properties of the single particle wave function .",
    "yet another way of posing the single particle scenario is to consider two actual measurements of the spin in the @xmath6 and @xmath11 directions .",
    "the experimental arrangement is a stern - gerlach apparatus aligned in the @xmath6 direction with another stern - gerlach apparatus located in the upper arm of the former but aligned in the @xmath11 direction ( see fig .",
    "electron counters , d1 and d2 , are placed at the two outputs of the 2nd apparatus . if there is a detection in either of these two outputs",
    ", then we know that the state of the electron incident on the 2nd apparatus is @xmath34 and so can consider this to be a measurement of the @xmath6 component of the spin of the incident electron . on the other hand , @xmath34 can be represented as @xmath29 and so the specific counter that registers the detection can be considered a measurement of the @xmath11 component of the spin . then the correlation of the spin of the incident electron , + 1 , with the spin detected by the second apparatus is again given by @xmath35 . in this case",
    "the final step of the two measurements performed on a single particle occur simultaneously and so nonlocality , superluminal wave function collapse , and entanglement are all irrelevant .    while the single particle scenario results in the same correlations as in the two particle spin singlet system of bell ,",
    "does this imply that the former also constitutes a violation of a bell - type inequality and thereby demonstrates the fallacy of hidden variable theories ?",
    "the answer is , in general , no .",
    "bell @xcite pointed out that the single particle case does provides an example of von neumann s  no hidden variables \" proof ; however , that proof involved an assumption that bell and others ( e.g. , mermin@xcite ) characterized as  silly \" .",
    "bell went on to construct a viable hidden variable theory for a single spin @xmath1 particle that did nt rely on von neumann s silly condition .",
    "therefore , the single particle case is not particularly useful in evaluating the viability of hidden variable theories nor illuminating arguments for the nonlocality of quantum mechanics . on the other hand ,",
    "the two measurement stern - gerlach scenario above can be couched in terms of the four - dimensional , two particle subject of the bell - kochen - specker theorem@xcite that illustrates the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with hidden variable theories contingent on the assumption of  noncontextuality \" of the latter .",
    "bell@xcite also considered this assumption unreasonable but mermin would not go so far @xcite . while one might argue with applying the bell - kochen - specker theorem to the above two measurement single particle scenario ,",
    "i remind the reader that the purpose of the single particle scenarios is not to comment on the viability of hidden variable theories _ per se _ but rather to shed light on the origin of the quantum mechanical correlations that figured so critically in bell s proof and thereby to help explain the magic of quantum mechanical entanglement .",
    "the point is that the two particles in bell s spin singlet system each carry with them the single particle correlations that are eventually manifested in correlated observations of the entangled state .",
    "that is , the magic of the correlations of bell s entangled system is a direct consequence of the quantum behavior of a single spin @xmath1 particle .",
    "as i pointed out above , bell s definition of locality is essentially the same as the experimentally motived separation principle , which i claim is not violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "so why did he find that quantum mechanics violates his inequality and , hence , the notion of locality ?",
    "the problem comes from the translation of his verbal definition of locality into its mathematical expression in the context of hidden variables . in his notation , let @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the results of the spin measurements of particles 1 and 2 in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions respectively .",
    "then bell expresses the expectation value of the product of ( the correlation of ) the two measurements as @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents any hidden variables with statistical distribution @xmath40 .",
    "this is analogous to the product of operators definition ( given by shimony ) that precludes the types of correlations that quantum mechanics demands .",
    "therefore , bell s mathematical expression of locality goes beyond his initially stated experimentalist separation principle .    to be sure , in his 1964 paper , bell",
    "did not conclude that quantum mechanics is nonlocal , only that a classical hidden variable model designed to reproduce the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics must necessarily be nonlocal .",
    "however , in a subsequent paper@xcite , he formalized  a notion of local causality \" that was directly applicable to quantum mechanics and concluded that quantum mechanics itself is nonlocal .",
    "this analysis used a mathematical expression of locality similar to the above direct product of probabilities .",
    "the other concept necessary for the derivation of bell s original inequality was a notion of  classical realism \" , which in the 1964 paper takes the form of classical hidden variables and the counterfactual definiteness they imply . in his 1975 paper",
    "he introduced the more general concept of  local beables \" .",
    "however , some of these beables functioned in the same way as the hidden variables in his 1964 paper and so it is not surprising that an inequality he derived from these assumptions is violated by the predictions of quantum mechanics thereby revealing that quantum mechanics violated locality as he defined it .",
    "the phenomenon of entanglement is not restricted to quantum mechanics .",
    "two classical systems that interact with each other before moving off in different directions are also entangled . to the extent that the interaction can be completely characterized",
    ", one can predict the correlations of all possible measurements made on the two systems whether space - like separated or not .",

    "even the epr paper invokes the notion of wave function collapse .",
    "the problem is that wave function collapse , even if ( contrary to dyson s and wigner s contentions ) it were a sensible concept , is not predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "it is an event that happens outside the mathematical formalism of the theory .",
    "in fact , formal quantum theory says absolutely nothing at all about measurements and how they should be performed or even how to interpret the results of measurements .",
    "the statistical distributions of quantum mechanical predictions follow from rules for how to interpret the constructs of quantum theory in terms of the results of experiments .",
    "the measurements themselves are not described by quantum theory but rather by the operational prescriptions of the experimentalists and technicians who perform them .",
    "this is yet another sense in which quantum mechanics is incomplete .",
    "finally , einstein was willing to consider another resolution to the epr  paradox \" if one were to assume that quantum mechanics does not apply to a single system but rather only to an ensemble of similarly prepared systems . in his words , ",
    "the @xmath41 function does not in any way describe a condition which could be that of a single system ; it relates rather to many systems , to ` an ensemble of systems ' in the sense of statistical mechanics.\"@xcite the ensemble interpretation , while minimalist , is considered by many to be the most reasonable interpretation of quantum mechanics ( e.g. , see ballentine@xcite ) . while einstein admitted that ",
    "such an interpretation eliminates also the [ epr ] paradox \" , he added  to believe this is logically possible without contradiction ; but , it is so very contrary to my scientific instinct that i can not forego the search for a more complete conception . \" in other words , he would still strongly suspect that quantum mechanics is incomplete .",
    "in this paper i argue that the  magic \" of entangled quantum states has little to do with nonlocality , superluminal interactions , or even entanglement itself but rather is yet another example of quantum mechanical superposition , which is magic even in the context of a single particle . on the other hand",
    ", i have no real criticism of bell s 1964 proof .",
    "so what is it that bell s theorem is telling us ? for me , it is a nifty demonstration of why it is that hidden variable theories of quantum mechanics do not work . as such it can serve , if properly presented , as a useful pedagogical tool to help beginning students of quantum mechanics overcome an initial tendency to view the  wave function \" as simply a replacement for the notion of  particle \" in the description of nature .",
    "however , for me furry s 1936 response to the epr paper and to bohr s published reply provides a more straightforward demonstration , in the context of two interacting ( entangled ) systems , of the difference between an intuitive classical minded model that students often conjure and what quantum mechanics actually says .",
    "furry wrote his paper only a few months after the epr - bohr exchange and bell cited it in the very first sentence of his 1964 paper .",
    "furry@xcite considers the wave function for two systems ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) that interacted in the past and now have ceased to interact .",
    " one can show that there always exists an expansion , which is in general unique , in the form @xmath44 where the @xmath45 are eigenfunctions of an observable _ l _ ... and the @xmath46 are eigenfunctions of an observable _ r _ ... \"",
    "furry s classically minded hypothesis is that  during the interaction of the two systems each system made a transition to a definite state , in which it now is , system @xmath42 being in one of the states @xmath45 and system @xmath43 in one of the states @xmath46 . \" there is no way to predict into which pair of states , @xmath47 , the systems end up , only that the probability of ending up in any of the pairs is given by @xmath48 .",
    "this sort of picture often finds itself in the minds of beginning students of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is one that preserves the primary status of the wave function and associated probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and yet allows the classical notion that spatially separated systems have independent properties even if these properties are to be specified entirely by quantum mechanical wave functions . as such",
    ", it is a reasonable model for the type of reality , i.e. , the real properties of systems , that einstein wanted to preserve .",
    "furry then proceeds to demonstrate that while this hypothesis gives the same answers as quantum mechanics for most of the questions raised in discussions of the theory of measurements , there is a general class of questions where contradictions occur , namely those measurements involving  the well - known phenomenon of ` interference ' between probability amplitudes . \"",
    "furry concluded that  ... there is of course nothing magical about the affair . the interference effect does not come in unless there has been an actual opportunity for the two particles to get interchanged , just as in the case in hand there is never any relation between the systems without the existence of an actual dynamical interaction to start it.\"@xcite furry s classically motivated hypothesis results in the same product of probabilities that bell and shimony use as a condition of locality and",
    "so it is no mystery why furry s hypothesis results in the same disagreement with standard quantum interference .    furry s analysis is in some ways more general than bell s in that he does nt specify a particular type of quantum state and in some ways less general in that he specifies a particular classically minded hypothesis rather than some general specification of hidden variables . for me ,",
    "furry s analysis is the better pedagogical tool for helping students of quantum mechanics realize the extent to which quantum mechanics diverges from our classical intuition .",
    "if so , then why is bell s paper so well known while furry s paper is largely forgotten ?",
    "perhaps one reason is that bell derived a specific test , in the form of an inequality , that local hidden variable theories satisfy and that quantum mechanics does not .",
    "another is that by 1964 , bell was able to conceive of actual experiments that could perform this test , the first of which happened 8 years later .",
    "finally , i m sure that part of the reason is the subsequent analyses by bell and others that supposedly demonstrated the nonlocal character of quantum mechanics and by inference of nature herself .",
    "it is with this conclusion that i take issue .    in the first paragraph of the introduction",
    "i noted david mermin s contention that physicists views of bell s theorem fall  between the majority position of near indifference and the minority position of wild extravagance\"@xcite and it is perhaps not surprising that most papers on bell s theorem tended toward the minority position and the implied nonlocality of quantum mechanics .",
    "even so , the contrarian view i have taken is certainly not solitary .",
    "most physicists seem to prefer to remain silent ( the near indifferent majority ) ; however , some notable scientists , including gell - mann , dyson , mermin , furry , hartle and peres , while emphasizing different aspects of entanglement , have expressed sentiments similar to mine .",
    "there are also several philosophers among the skeptics . in his paper on the epistemological implications of bell s inequality@xcite , van fraassen points out that most quantum nonlocality arguments hinge on applying the notion of  common cause \" to bell - type scenarios .",
