    "the first model consists of three qubits , two constitute the refrigerator , and one is the object to be cooled .",

    "consider first two qubits , for simplicity taken initially to be immersed in the same bath at room temperature @xmath1 , but later two different baths .",
    "qubit 1 is the object to be cooled , while qubit 2 will eventually play the role of the `` spiral '' that takes heat from qubit 1 and dissipates it into the environment .",
    "the free hamiltonian for the two qubits is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a projector for qubit @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the ground states at zero energy , and @xmath6 are the excited states at energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , where we take @xmath9 .    at equilibrium",
    "each qubit is in a thermal state @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "since the qubits do not interact the total thermal state is simply the direct product state @xmath14    a convenient way to represent the thermal state ( [ thermal state ] ) is in terms of the probabilities , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , to find the qubit in the eigenstates @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , @xmath19 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath20 the steady - state temperature of each qubit when refrigeration is occurring .",
    "cooling of qubit 1 means reaching a temperature @xmath21 , corresponding to a larger ground state probability @xmath22 .",
    "the idea of algorithmic cooling is to increase @xmath23 by transferring excitations to the second qubit . specifically , the probabilities of the eigenstates @xmath24 and @xmath25 of @xmath26 are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "since we take @xmath9 , it follows that @xmath29 , i.e. we are more likely to be in the state @xmath24 where qubit 1 is excited than in @xmath25 where it is in the ground state .",
    "suppose now that we apply a unitary @xmath30 , which swaps these two states , @xmath31 while leaving the others unchanged .",
    "after the swap we increase the ground state probability of qubit 1 , therefore cooling it , and decrease the ground state probability of qubit 2 , thus heating it .",
    "since the qubits are in contact with a thermal bath they will eventually return to the environmental temperature @xmath1 if we do nothing else .",
    "however , if we keep repeating @xmath30 , qubits 1 and 2 will reach steady - state temperatures @xmath21 and @xmath32 .",
    "the procedure above however requires external work to be performed , since the energy of @xmath25 is larger than that of @xmath24 .",
    "this is provided by some external system that induces the unitary transformation @xmath30 ; for example , in an nmr experiment this could be done via a sequence of pulses of an external magnetic field .",
    "the idea behind our model is to replace the external work by a different source of free energy : free energy can be provided whenever a system has access to two thermal baths at different temperatures . in our model",
    "this is accomplished by adding a third qubit , in contact with a thermal bath at a hotter temperature @xmath33 .",
    "this qubit plays the role of the `` engine '' .",
    "thus our fridge consists in qubits 2 and 3 ( the spiral and engine respectively ) ; qubit 1 is the object to be cooled .    to enable transitions between different states without an input of external energy ,",
    "we take the engine qubit to have the energy level spacing @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 . with this condition",
    "we now have two degenerate energy eigenstates @xmath36 and @xmath37 which can be swapped without requiring work . the interchange @xmath38 accomplishes on qubits 1 and 2 the transformation .    for transitions between @xmath36 and @xmath37 to occur we introduce an interaction hamiltonian @xmath39 with @xmath40 the interaction strength .",
    "note that the interaction is now via a hamiltonian and not a unitary transformation .",
    "the distinction is important since a unitary necessarily implies external control  a device to implement the correct timing , as well as a means of protecting the system from other external interactions .",
    "by using a hamiltonian no such external control is required .",
    "furthermore this interaction is taken to be weak compared to the free hamiltonian , @xmath41 . in this regime",
    "the interaction will not significantly alter the energy eigenvalues or eigenvectors of the system ( which remain governed by @xmath42 ) and hence we can meaningfully talk about the temperature of the individual qubits , since each will remain in the standard thermal form , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 the same as in the absence of interaction .    to understand the model first note that the interaction hamiltonian can swap without impediment the states @xmath36 and @xmath37 , since they are degenerate in energy in - so - far as the free hamiltonian is concerned .",
    "however , if all qubits were kept at the same temperature , the system would be at equilibrium since the the probability of the flips are equal .",
    "to drive the transitions in one direction and cool qubit 1 , we place the third qubit in a hotter bath ; the probability of @xmath37 becomes larger than that of @xmath36 and so we enhance the probability of the forward flip in and diminish that of the backward flip .",
    "it is this biasing of the interaction which takes heat from qubit 1 into qubit 2 , creating a refrigerator .",
    "the simplest way to model each qubit being in contact with a thermal bath is to imagine that with probability density @xmath43 per unit time each qubit is thermalised back to its initial thermal state .",
    "( note that for qubit 3 the bath temperature is now @xmath44 ) .",
    "mathematically we model this by the non - unitary evolution @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath43 quantifies how well insulated each particle is relative to the bath .",

    "however , we are interested only in the limit of vanishing @xmath40 and @xmath49 such that @xmath50 constant . in this limit corrections to , of order @xmath51 , vanish , and the master equation is consistent .",

    "p_i(\\tau_i { \\rm tr}_i \\rho^{s } - \\rho^{s})$ ] . the solution can easily be found analytically , but has a complicated dependence on all the parameters , therefore it is much more illuminating to present a numerical analysis .",
    "figure  [ f : qutrit fridge ] shows the temperature difference between qubit  1 ( the system to be cooled ) and it s bath , as a function of the temperature of the hot bath , @xmath44 .",
    "the solid curve shows that when @xmath55 we are able to achieve cooling , i.e. @xmath56 , and when @xmath57 , that is when we supply no free energy , the temperature of qubit 1 is unchanged . in the dashed and dotted curve",
    "we show furthermore that if the cold qubit is in contact with a _ colder _ bath ( at temperature @xmath58 ) , then we are still able to achieve cooling , i.e. @xmath59 , provided @xmath44 is hot enough .",
    "therefore in all instances we demonstrate that our system acts as a refrigerator .    until now we have focused solely on the task of cooling a qubit .",
    "one question is whether our fridge is able to cool more arbitrary objects than just a qubit . to achieve this ,",
    "consider qubit 1 now as part of the fridge and use _ it _ to cool other objects . to see that is a valid viewpoint , in fig .",
    "[ f : energy ] we display the stationary heat current @xmath52 flowing between the bath and qubit 1 .",
    "the heat current is defined as @xmath60,@xcite where @xmath61 is the dissipator for qubit 1 .",
    "we see that a positive current flows whenever the cold qubit is cooled below its bath temperature ( c.f .",
    "[ f : qutrit fridge ] ) .",
    "thus viewing the environment as the arbitrary object , we see that we are able to extract heat from it and therefore cool it .",
    "this may also be seen as independent confirmation that our system works as a refrigerator .",

    "qubit 1 steady - state temperature @xmath62 against energy level spacing @xmath8 . as the spacing increases the spin",
    "is cooled arbitrarily close to absolute zero . ]",
    "a natural question to ask is how the behaviour of the fridge changes as we vary the parameters @xmath43 independently . indeed , in a",
    "` standard ' refrigerator we do not want all parts to interact with the environment equally : the inside of the fridge has to be well insulated to maintain a low temperature while the spiral at the back of the fridge has to interact strongly with the environment to dissipate heat quickly .",
    "hence , for qubit 2 , ( the spiral ) we expect that as @xmath63 becomes larger the performance of the fridge should increase ( @xmath62 should decrease ) .",
    "furthermore , qubit 3 plays the role of the `` engine '' of the refrigerator , which it achieves by pumping heat from the hot environment into the system .",
    "we thus expect that the best performance is achieved when it interacts strongly with its environment , as this allows it to extract heat at the highest rate .    in fig .",
    "[ f : vary p1p2 ] we plot the dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for small values of @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "we indeed observe the expected behaviour , however as we increase them further the performance degrades .",
    "the reason is that the quantum zeno effect @xcite comes into play in the regime of strong coupling between the qubits and the environment .",
    "thermalisation is as though the environment measures each qubit .",
    "as we increase the rate of thermalisation we enter a regime where the interaction @xmath48 will not have time to work between successive thermalisations and hence the refrigerator is no longer able to function .",
    "the dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath66 is as expected ; coldest temperatures are achieved in the limit of perfect insulation .",
    "see appendix for further details .      an important question is whether or not there are _ fundamental _ limitations on the temperature to which we are able to cool the cold qubit .",
    "we show that no such limitations exist .",
    "the minimal achievable temperature is limited by two effects : heat flowing into the fridge due to imperfect insulation , and the actual cooling ability ( i.e. the ability to cool given perfect insulation ) .",
    "it is the second aspect which we are interested in .",
    "we fix @xmath7 , a characteristic of the object to be cooled and not of the refrigerator and also fix @xmath1 , the environmental temperature .",
    "we increase @xmath34 ( therefore @xmath8 also ) and @xmath44 such that the ratio @xmath67 remains constant and much less than 1 .",
    "this results in increasing the ground state probability of qubit 2 , while maintaining a large excited state probability for qubit 3 .",
    "altogether this means that the interaction becomes ever more biased as we increase @xmath34 .",
    "this leads to cooling as close as we want towards absolute zero , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : abszero ] .",
    "one drawback of the previous model is that the interaction hamiltonian is a three body interaction . here",
    "we present a model with only two - body nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "the model consists of three particles , where one is to be cooled and two construct the fridge .",
    "particles @xmath68 and @xmath69 are qubits and particle @xmath70 is a qutrit .",
    "the energy levels of each particle are such that the energy eigenstates @xmath71 and @xmath37 are degenerate . by introducing an interaction which can take the population of the latter into the former we can cool down qubit 1 .",
    "we do this by introducing two separate interactions between the particles via the hamiltonians @xmath72 neither nor induces transitions between the two desired states",
    ". however , causes transitions between @xmath71 and @xmath73 and between @xmath73 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , in _ second _ order we induce the desired transition .",
    "finally we bias this interaction , as previously , by taking particles 1 and 2 to be in contact with a bath at temperature @xmath1 and qubit 3 at @xmath44 .",
    "this model behaves qualitatively the same as our previous one ; details are given in the supplementary information .",
    "in the previous model the qutrit was taken to be in contact with a bath at temperature @xmath1 . however",
    ", we could conceive of situations where each of its energy eigenstates has a different spatial distribution and so can be in contact with environments at differing temperatures . in such situations",
    "a smaller refrigerator can be constructed , by discarding the third qubit  the fridge now contains only a single qutrit , see fig .",
    "[ f : smallest ] .",
    "we believe this is the smallest possible system which may be called a refrigerator .",
    "schematic diagram of a fridge consisting of a single qutrit ( particle 2 ) with the object to be cooled ( particle 1 ) ]",
    "we presented three simple models demonstrating that there is no fundamental difficulty in constructing small , self contained refrigerators . moreover showed that it is possible to cool towards absolute zero .",
    "there are many interesting questions for the future .",
    "the first is what can be said about the efficiency of small refrigerators .",
    "is our construction the most efficient or are there other hamiltonians which are better for cooling ?",
    "moreover , it is fundamental to ask whether or not there exists a complementarity between small dimension and efficiency  can you only be large and efficient or small and inefficient ?",
    "i.e. can a small machine reach the efficiency of an ideal carnot engine ?",
    "our particular models do not reach this efficiency : both the spiral and the engine qubits reach stationary temperatures that differ by a finite ( instead of infinitesimal ) amount from the temperatures of their environments , which leads to irreversible heat exchanges . however , is there a better model ?",
    "this is not clear , since in a carnot cycle the system transitions through infinitely many states , not a finite number as we do here .",
    "the question is whether or not this affects the achievable efficiency of the refrigerator",
    ".    finally it would be interesting to study other thermal machines , for example ones that produce ` work ' .",
