    "for massless neutrinos , the leading contribution to low energy neutrino - photon scattering vanishes because the amplitude can be written in the form of a vector or axial - vector current coupling to the photons .",
    "the largest low energy interaction between photons and neutrinos is therefore @xmath2 and the crossed channels .",
    "rates for these processes have been calculated , for energies less than the electron mass , @xmath3 , by using an effective action @xcite and , for larger energies , by a straight - forward calculation of box diagrams @xcite .    in the presence of magnetic fields",
    "neutrino photon elastic scattering does exist because the magnetic field gives an additional interaction  it effectively replaces one of the photons in @xmath2 with a zero momentum insertion .",
    "this too has been calculated ; for low energies using the effective action for the @xmath4 processes @xcite and , at higher energies , by calculating triangle diagrams in the external field @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to criticize mildly and extend slightly these external field results .",
    "in particular the effective action paper @xcite gave results for only one channel ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we extend this to all channels with @xmath6 perpendicular and parallel for each channel .",
    "results of the more general calculation of ref.@xcite are given in three figures .",
    "we believe the curves in these figures are somewhat in error ; for example , they sometimes disagree at low energies with our extended effective action results . both references @xcite and @xcite express their results in terms of the critical magnetic field @xmath7 gauss . in each case",
    "the authors have taken @xmath8 to be in unrationalized units , @xmath9 . whereas it should have been taken to be in natural units @xmath10 .",
    "thus all their results are too large by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "the calculation of ref.@xcite uses the effective interaction given in ref.@xcite . in this interaction , as in the euler - heisenberg lagrangian upon which it is based , @xmath12 equals @xmath13 so the coupling of the magnetic field has been taken as this @xmath8 . as discussed in ref.@xcite the critical field , when written as @xmath14 ,",
    "uses @xmath8 in these same natural units .",
    "the value of the critical field , @xmath15 gauss , means that in natural ( or rationalized ) units 1 tesla @xmath16 .",
    "the result of ref.@xcite agrees in every respect with the result given below for @xmath17 with the external field perpendicular to the direction of the photons except in the replacement of @xmath18 by @xmath19 where it should be replaced by @xmath20 . since the curve @xmath17 in fig . 2 of ref.@xcite agrees , at low energy , with the result of ref.@xcite",
    "these authors too must have made the wrong substitution for @xmath21 .",
    "the explicit calculations at low energy , using the effective action , are unremarkable and give the following results . for @xmath5 and @xmath22",
    "the cross sections with center of mass energy @xmath23 and scattering angle @xmath24 are given by @xmath25\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 for @xmath5 and 1/2 for @xmath27 .",
    "for electron neutrinos , including both the @xmath28 and @xmath29-boson contributions , @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fermi constant and @xmath33 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on whether the @xmath6 field is parallel or perpendicular to the direction of the initial particles and are given in table i.    the cross section for @xmath36 is given by @xmath37\\,\\ ] ] where terms odd in @xmath24 have been dropped .",
    "using the @xmath34 and @xmath35 values and completing the integral over @xmath24 gives @xmath38 where the @xmath39 values for the six cases are given in table i. note that the result for @xmath5 with perpendicular @xmath6 agrees with ref .",
    "@xcite if the @xmath11 is ignored .",
    "also note that the differential cross sections for parallel @xmath6 go as @xmath40 as they must .",
    "the @xmath41 values show that the cross sections for @xmath36 differ by a factor of about 4 depending on whether the magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath22 differ by a factor of about 200 .",
    "these differences are not present in the figures of ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors of refs.@xcite do a nice job of deriving the lowest order constant magnetic field contribution to photon - neutrino scattering , both from the correction to the electron propagator and from the phase factor .",
    "their expression for the matrix element @xcite seems entirely correct with the exception of a relative minus sign in the tensor which multiplies the coefficient function @xmath42 .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite inform us that this is a typographical error @xcite .",
    "we agree with all the coefficient functions @xmath43 .",
    "the results of our calculation of neutrino - photon scattering in a constant magnetic field following the methods of refs.@xcite and @xcite are shown in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 for the three channels .",
    "all calculations are for @xmath44 as is the case in ref.@xcite . at low energies",
    "the cross sections agree almost exactly with eq.([sigb ] ) .",
    "note the relative factor of about 4 between the magnetic field directions for @xmath36 and the similar factor of about 200 for @xmath45 . also note the infrared divergence at @xmath46 in the @xmath47 channels where the magnetic field interaction acts as a zero energy insertion on an external leg .    for large energy all of the cross sections grow as @xmath48 except for @xmath5 with @xmath6 parallel to the photon direction , which decreases .",
    "after summation over photon polarizations , the cross section for this channel can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the field strength of the magnetic field and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the momenta of the photons .",
    "the @xmath53 are combinations of the coefficient functions @xmath54 . for a magnetic field in a direction @xmath55",
    "this reduces to @xmath56+\\omega^2a_3\\;[1 + \\widehat{k}_1\\cdot\\vec n\\,\\hat{k}_2\\cdot\\vec n\\;]\\,.\\ ] ] thus for @xmath5 with @xmath57 parallel to @xmath58 and @xmath59 the coefficients of @xmath60 and @xmath61 vanish .",
    "@xmath62 , which in this channel depends only on @xmath63 , falls as @xmath64 for @xmath65 , giving the decrease at large @xmath23 seen in fig.([ggnnb ] ) . @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not vanish for @xmath57 perpendicular to @xmath58 and @xmath59 nor do they vanish for either @xmath6 direction in the other channels .",
    "we have extended the low energy effective lagrangian calculation of ref.@xcite to include all channels and directions of the magnetic field b. in figs.([ggnnb]-[gngnb ] ) , we have given correct values for the cross sections at all energies , which , while shown for @xmath66 , can be scaled by @xmath67 .",
    "( of course , following ref.@xcite and @xcite , we have essentially done perturbation theory in @xmath68 so our results are not valid for much larger @xmath6 . ) all calculations were performed for electron neutrinos but this too can be easily changed by using @xmath69 for the other neutrino types .",
    "it turns out that neutrino photon scattering in an external magnetic field is less important , relative to the @xmath4 processes , than previously thought [ 4 ] . since the effects of these processes on stars",
    "was already calculated [ 4 ] to be small we have not repeated the determination of the stellar energy loss rates or mean free paths .",
