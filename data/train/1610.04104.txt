    "numerous observational studies across the electromagnetic spectrum have shown that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powerful emitters of variable radiation from the radio band to @xmath2-ray energies and that a sizable amount of this radiation is emitted in the optical , uv , x - ray energy bands .",
    "it is generally thought that agn are powered by accretion onto a central supermassive black hole and that the optical - uv emission is the thermal radiation produced directly from the accretion flow , whereas the x - rays are produced through the comptonization process in a putative corona .",
    "while this general picture is widely accepted , the details of the interaction between disk and corona , the geometry and physical state of the latter , as well as the origin of the variability are still poorly understood .",
    "one of the most promising approaches to shed some light on the inner region of black holes systems is to track the variable behavior of the different components of the central engine using multi - wavelength monitoring observations . over the years",
    ", coordinated optical and x - ray monitoring observations of agn have revealed that , in addition to the ubiquitous x - ray variability , long - term optical variations are consistently detected .",
    "the latter are generally interpreted as intrinsic variations of the disk emission caused by disturbances propagating across the disk or , alternatively , as a result of the disk reprocessing of the x - ray emission produced by the corona . in this context , various monitoring studies have yielded contrasting results , with some sources showing highly correlated optical / x - ray behavior with one band leading the other , and some others showing no correlation at all ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . some of the inferred discrepancies may be attributed to the intrinsic difficulties of coordinating satellite - based x - ray monitoring with ground - based optical observations , which may also be hampered by weather conditions .",
    "an important step forward in this field has been the advent of , which , thanks to its flexibility and simultaneous coverage of several bands in the optical / uv range and in the x - rays , eliminates all possible ambiguities associated with weather conditions and lack of coordination in the different energy bands . in principle , true contemporaneous observations in several energy bands should make it possible to test wether the diverse temporal behavior observed in different objects is related to some fundamental properties of the central engine . more specifically , different combinations of black hole mass @xmath3 and accretion rate @xmath4 may be responsible for the diverse behavior observed in various bh systems .",
    "for example , uttley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) hypothesized that objects with large @xmath3 and low @xmath4 should yield a relatively tight x - ray / optical correlation , since they have cooler disks and hence the optical region closer ( in units of gravitational radii ) to the x - ray emitting central corona .",
    "conversely , for agn with small @xmath3 and high @xmath4 , the region producing the optical is relatively distant from the x - ray region ( the corona ) and hence an uncorrelated optical / x - ray behavior may be expected .    in our previous work , we investigated with  the long - term behavior of , an x - ray bright radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) with @xmath5 likely accreting at super - eddington rate .",
    "the main findings of our 1.5 year monitoring campaign can be summarized as follows .",
    "is highly variable at all wavelengths probed by , with variability levels decreasing from the x - rays to the optical bands .",
    "the large - amplitude variations measured by the uvw2 filter are strongly correlated with all the other optical and uv bands and weakly ( but significantly ) correlated with the x - ray variations .",
    "these results , combined with suggestive evidence that in perturbations propagate from the outer to the inner parts of the accretion flow and to the corona , confirm the existence of physical link between disk and corona and disfavor the reprocessing scenario ( for more details see @xcite ) .    here , to further investigate the link between accretion disk and corona and its putative dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we study the correlated variability properties of the prototypical bare seyfert 1 galaxy , which has a relatively large black hole mass , @xmath6 @xcite and low accretion rate @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "past studies have shown that  stands out among bright seyfert galaxies for the lack of any evidence for reddening in ir and uv observations @xcite and warm absorbers @xcite and is highly variable source over the entire spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "when @xmath34 is plotted vs. the total x - ray count rate , a weak but statistically significant anti - correlation is found , indicating that the x - ray spectrum softens when the source brightens , which is the typical behavior observed in seyfert galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : fig4 ] ) . additionally , soft and hard x - ray fluxes are tightly correlated and well described by a linear equation , whose slope is consistent with unity and",
    "whose intercept is inconsistent with zero , suggesting the presence of a constant hard component .",
    "finally , the light curve of the broadband spectral index indicates that the entire sed varies throughout the monitoring campaign ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : fig5 ] ) . * _ spectral analysis : _ the spectral analysis of individual @xmath128 1 ks observations does not provide conclusive results about the long - term spectral variability of , due to the limited statistics .",
    "however , combining several individual spectra into a low - flux and a high - flux spectrum and then performing a model fitting of these two flux - selected spectra makes it possible to conclude that the steeper - when - brighter behavior is caused by the steepening of the photon index . *",
    "correlation analysis : _ a cross correlation analysis of the  uvot and xrt light curves of  indicates that soft and hard x - ray variations are strongly correlated and occur nearly simultaneously . also the u and uvm2 light curves are well correlated with each other and do not show any substantial delay . when the uv light curves are correlated with the x - ray light curve , a possible ( but not statistically significant ) delay is tentatively detected , with the x - ray leading the variations in the uv bands by a few days ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : fig9 ] ) .",
    "this result is confirmed at a higher significance level by using the combined u and uvm2 light curve for the correlation analysis with the soft x - ray light curve ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : fig10 ] ) . finally , the hardness ratio @xmath34 appears to be anti - correlated with the soft x - ray light curve , and with the combined uv light curve .",
    "while there is no relevant lag between @xmath34 and x - ray flux , it appears that the changes in the uv light curve are delayed by several days ( @xmath129 d ) with respect to the @xmath34 changes .",
    "the reason for the uv - hr correlation was to investigate the possibility that the observed uv photons are the input soft photons up - scattered in the hot corona . in this case , an increase in the flux of soft photons may cause the cooling of the corona , and hence a steepening in the observed x - ray spectrum , as it has been observed in the past ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our results do not support this possibility and may be explained by the fact that the x - rays and hr are strongly anti - correlated ( with no delay ) , and the x - rays and uv are moderately correlated with a delay of a few days .",
    "our study confirms that  behaves as a typical seyfert galaxy with persistent x - ray ( and uv ) flux variability associated with spectral variability , where the spectrum softens as the source brightens .",
    "this spectral behavior too is common to the vast majority of seyfert galaxies .",
    "however , the  bare \" nature of  ensures that the spectral variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the primary emission , rather than being associated with variations of the absorber surrounding the source , as suggested for many other agn .",
    "our results , obtained from a model - independent analysis of monitoring data spanning several months , appear to be consistent with those based on detailed spectral analysis of broadband spectra obtained from the long uninterrupted exposures .",
    "for instance , the fact that the intercept of the hard vs. soft x - ray correlation is positive and inconsistent with zero indicates the presence of a constant hard component , which is naturally explained by the reflection component detected by @xcite using high - quality spectra from  and _",
    "nustar_.    the results from the cross - correlation analysis ( the tentative time lag of the uv flux with respect to the x - ray light curve ) are consistent with the reprocessing scenario , where changes in the uv / optical emitting accretion disk are driven by changes in the x - ray corona .",
    "although the measured time lag is poorly constrained due to the large statistical uncertainty ( @xmath130 d , which is obtained when the combined uv light curve is used for the correlation analysis ) , to put  in context , it is helpful to compare its correlation results with those obtained in similar studies .    in particular , it is interesting to investigate whether there exists a correlation between time lags and @xmath3 or @xmath4 , using agn whose uv and x - ray light curves have been simultaneously monitored by  for several months .",
    "in addition to the two objects studied by our group : pks 0558 - 504 @xmath131 and @xmath132 @xcite , and  @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( this work ) , this limited sample of agn comprises ngc 4395 @xmath135 and @xmath134 @xcite , ngc 2617 @xmath136 and @xmath137 @xcite , ngc 5548 @xmath138 and @xmath139 @xcite , and ngc 6814 @xmath140 and @xmath141 @xcite .    in figure  [ figure : fig11 ]",
    "we plotted the time delays between the uv band and the x - ray detected for these objects .",
    "for all objects , we used the lag value reported for the uvot u filter ( @xmath142 nm ) , with the exception of ngc 6814 for which only the lag of uvw1",
    "( @xmath143 nm ) was measured .",
    "pks 0558 - 504 was not included because the detection of a lag was not statistically significant .",
    "however , it is worth noting that pks 0558 - 504 putative delay ( @xmath144 days ) was of the same order as the one detected in , which has a similar black hole mass , but negative ( i.e. , with the uv emission that appears to lead the x - rays by a few days ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that pks 0558 - 504 is the only object for which such a negative delay has been putatively detected and the only agn of this sample with accretion rate above the eddington level .",
    "all objects in fig .",
    "[ figure : fig11 ] , with the exception of ngc 6814 , are reasonably well fitted with a linear model , represented by the dashed line @xmath145 .",
    "this finding is qualitatively in agreement with the general picture of black hole systems , where the length - scale is set by the black hole mass , naturally implying a larger physical separation ( and hence longer delays ) for systems with larger @xmath3 .",
    "the dotted lines , which represent the light travel times for 500 @xmath146 and 1000 @xmath146 , suggest that , with the exception of ngc 4395 ( for which no significant lag was detected ) , all agn of this sample require a physical separation between the x - ray emitting region and the uv region of the order of 1000 @xmath1 or more ( ngc 6814 ) .",
    "these values are considerably larger than the physical locations of the uv emitting region predicted by the standard accretion disk model ; using equation ( 2 ) from @xcite ) we obtain values of the order @xmath147 .",
    "we therefore conclude that , for this sample of agn , these cross - correlation results imply a larger accretion disk compared to the shakura - sunyaev standard model , as suggested by recent findings based on micro - lensing studies from @xcite and intensive simultaneous monitoring of several energy bands in ngc 5548 @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", our work indicates that long - term monitoring studies of agn provide useful information which is complementary to that obtained in long - exposure spectral studies .",
    "importantly , combining  correlation results with those of similar studies of agn monitored by , suggests the existence of a positive correlation between time lags and black hole mass .",
    "additional monitoring studies of agn spanning a broader range of @xmath3 and @xmath148 are necessary to derive a firmer conclusion .",
