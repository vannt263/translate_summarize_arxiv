    "by a full coincidence of the forms of coulomb s and newton s laws , which describe an interaction of electric charges and a gravitational interaction of bodies , we see a dramatic difference in developing the pictures of these interactions on a quantum level . constructed with pillars on multiple experiments",
    "qed is one of the most exact physical theories and an archetype for imitation by creation of new models . while the attempts to quantize the remarkable in its logical beauty theory of general relativity , which describes gravitation on a classical level so fully and delicately , ( see review @xcite ) not only have not a hit until today but gave a specific side psychological effect - there exists conceptualization that quantum gravity may be described only by some sophisticated theory",
    ". an opinion is commonly accepted , too , that quantum gravity should manifest itself only on the planck scale of energies , i.e. it is a high - energy phenomenon .",
    "the value of the planck energy @xmath0 gev has been got from dimensional reasonings .",
    "still one wide - spread opinion is that we know a mechanism of gravity ( bodies are exchanging with gravitons of spin 2 ) but can not correctly describe it .",
    "if an apple from the legend about newton s afflatus can imagine all these complications , it would hesitate to fall to the ground so artlessly as it is accepted among the apples .",
    "perhaps , physicists would be able to refuse easier the preconceived stereotypes which balk - as it seems to me - to go ahead in understanding quantum gravity if experiments or observations would give more essential meat for reasonings .",
    "but in this area , at least up to recent years , there was observed nothing that may serve if not ariadne s clew but such a simple physical contradiction that an aspiration to overcome it would advantage introduction of new ideas and revision of the `` inviolable '' .    in a few last years , the situation has been abruptly changed .",
    "i enumerate those discoveries and observations which may force , in my opinion , the ice to break up .    \\1 . in 1998 , anderson s team reported about the discovery of anomalous acceleration of nasa s probes pioneer 10/11 @xcite ; this effect is not embedded in a frame of the general relativity , and its magnitude is somehow equal to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble constant , @xmath3 is the light velocity .    \\2 .",
    "in the same 1998 , two teams of astrophysicists , which were collecting supernovae 1a data with the aim to specificate parameters of cosmological expansion , reported about dimming remote supernovae @xcite ; the one would be explained on a basis of the doppler effect if at present epoch the universe expands with acceleration .",
    "this explanation needs an introduction of some `` dark energy '' which is unknown from any laboratory experiments .",
    "\\3 . in january 2002 ,",
    "nesvizhevsky s team reported about discovery of quantum states of ultra - cold neutrons in the earth s gravitational field @xcite . observed energies of levels ( it means that and their differences too ) in full agreement with quantum - mechanical calculations turned out to be equal to @xmath4 ev .",
    "the formula for energy levels had been found still by bohr and sommerfeld .",
    "if transitions between these levels are accompanied with irradiation of gravitons then energies of irradiated gravitons should have the same order - but it is of 40 orders lesser than the planck energy by which one waits quantum manifestations of gravity .",
    "the first of these discoveries obliges to muse about the borders of applicability of the general relativity , the third - about that quantum gravity would be a high - energy phenomenon .",
    "it seems that the second discovery is far from quantum gravity but it obliges us to look at the traditional interpretation of the nature of cosmological redshift critically .",
    "an introduction into consideration of an alternative model of redshifts @xcite which is based on a conjecture about an existence of the graviton background gives us odds to see in the effect of dimming supernovae an additional manifestation of low - energy quantum gravity . under the definite conditions ,",
    "an effective temperature of the background may be the same one as a temperature of the cosmic microwave background , with an average graviton energy of the order @xmath5 ev .    in this chapter ,",
    "the main results of author s research in this approach are described .",
    "starting from a statistical model of the graviton background with low temperature , it is shown - under the very important condition that gravitons are super - strong interacting particles - that if a redshift would be a quantum gravitational effect then one can get from its magnitude an estimate of a new dimensional constant characterizing a single act of interaction in this model .",
    "it is possible to calculate theoretically a dependence of a light flux relaxation on a redshift value , and this dependence fits supernova observational data very well at least for @xmath6 .",
    "further it is possible to find a pressure of single gravitons of the background which acts on any pair of bodies due to screening the graviton background with the bodies @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the pressure is huge ( a corresponding force is @xmath7 times stronger than the newtonian attraction ) but it is compensated with a pressure of gravitons which are re - scattered by the bodies . the newtonian attraction arises if a part of gravitons of the background forms pairs which are destructed by interaction with bodies .",
    "it is interesting that both hubble s and newton s constants may be computed in this approach with the ones being connected between themselves .",
    "it allows us to get a theoretical estimate of the hubble constant .",
    "an unexpected feature of this mechanism of gravity is a necessity of `` an atomic structure '' of matter - the mechanism does nt work without the one .",
    "collisions with gravitons should also call forth a deceleration of massive bodies of order @xmath1 - namely the same as of nasa s probes .",
    "but at present stage it turns out unclear why such the deceleration has _ not _ been observed for planets .",
    "the situation reminds by something of the one that took place in physics before the creation of quantum mechanics when a motion of electrons should , as it seemed by canons of classical physics , lead to their fall to a nucleus .",
    "because the very unexpected hypothesis founded into the basis of this approach is a super - strong character of gravitational interaction on a quantum level , i would like to explain my motivation which conduced namely to such the choice .",
    "learning symmetries of the quantum two - component composite system @xcite , i have found that its discrete symmetries in an 8-space may be interpreted by an observer from a 4-dimensional world as the exact global symmetries of the standard model of particle physics if internal coordinates of the system ( the composite fermion ) are rigidly fixed .",
    "this conclusion was hard for me and took much enough time .",
    "but to ensure almost full fixation of components of the system , an interaction connecting them should be very strong .",
    "because of it , when a choice arise - an amount of gravitons or an intensity of the interaction , - i have remembered this overpassed earlier barrier and chose namely the super - strong interaction . without this property ,",
    "the graviton background would not be in the thermodynamical equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background that could entail big difficulties in the model .",
    "so , in this approach we deal with the following small quantum effects of low - energy gravity : redshifts , its analog - a deceleration of massive bodies , and an additional relaxation of any light flux .",
    "the newtonian attraction turns out to be the main statistical effect , with bodies themselves being not sources of gravitons - only correlational properties of _ in _ and _ out _ fluxes of gravitons in their neighbourhood are changed due to an interaction with bodies .",
    "there does still not exist a full and closed theory in this approach , but even the initial researches in this direction show that in this case quantum gravity can not be described separately of other interactions , and also manifest the boundaries of applicability of a geometrical language in gravity .",
    "let us introduce the hypothesis , which is considered in this approach as independent from the standard cosmological model : there exists the isotropic graviton background .",
    "photon scattering is possible on gravitons @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a photon and @xmath10 is a graviton , if one of the gravitons is virtual .",
    "the energy - momentum conservation law prohibits energy transfer to free gravitons . due to forehead collisions with gravitons ,",
    "an energy of any photon should decrease when it passes through the sea of gravitons .    from another side , none - forehead collisions of photons with gravitons of the background will lead to an additional relaxation of a photon flux , caused by transmission of a momentum transversal component to some photons .",
    "it will lead to an additional dimming of any remote objects , and may be connected with supernova dimming .",
    "we deal here with the uniform non - expanding universe with the euclidean space , and there are not any cosmological kinematic effects in this model .",
    "we shall take into account that a gravitational `` charge '' of a photon must be proportional to @xmath11 ( it gives the factor @xmath12 in a cross - section ) and a normalization of a photon wave function gives the factor @xmath13 in the cross - section .",
    "also we assume here that a photon average energy loss @xmath14 in one act of interaction is relatively small to a photon energy @xmath15 then average energy losses of a photon with an energy @xmath16 on a way @xmath17 will be equal to @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant . if a _ whole _",
    "redshift magnitude is caused by this effect , we must identify @xmath20 where @xmath3 is the light velocity , to have the hubble law for small distances @xcite .    a photon energy @xmath11 should depend on a distance from a source @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an initial value of energy .",
    "the expression ( 2 ) is just only so far as the condition @xmath24 takes place .",
    "photons with a very small energy may lose or acquire an energy changing their direction of propagation after scattering . early or late such photons should turn out in the thermodynamic equilibrium with the graviton background , flowing into their own background .",
    "decay of virtual gravitons should give photon pairs for this background , too .",
    "perhaps , the last one is the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "it follows from the expression ( 2 ) that an exact dependence @xmath25 is the following one : @xmath26 if an interaction with the graviton background is the only cause of redshifts .",
    "it is very important , that this redshift does not depend on a light frequency . for small @xmath27",
    "the dependence @xmath25 will be linear .",
    "the expressions ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) are the same that appear in other tired - light models ( compare with @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "the ones follow from a possible existence of the isotropic graviton background , from quantum electrodynamics , and from the fact that a gravitational `` charge '' of a photon must be proportional to @xmath15      photon flux s average energy losses on a way @xmath28 due to non - forehead collisions with gravitons should be proportional to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a new constant of the order @xmath31 these losses are connected with a rejection of a part of photons from a source - observer direction",
    ". such the relaxation together with the redshift will give a connection between visible object s diameter and its luminosity ( i.e. the ratio of an object visible angular diameter to a square root of visible luminosity ) , distinguishing from the one of the standard cosmological model .",
    "let us consider that in a case of a non - forehead collision of a graviton with a photon , the latter leaves a photon flux detected by a remote observer ( an assumption of a narrow beam of rays ) .",
    "the details of calculation of the theoretical value of relaxation factor @xmath30 which was used in author s paper @xcite were given later in the preprint @xcite .",
    "so as both particles have velocities @xmath32 a cross - section of interaction , which is `` visible '' under an angle @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , will be equal to @xmath34 if @xmath35 is a cross - section by forehead collisions .",
    "the function @xmath36 allows to take into account both front and back hemispheres for riding gravitons . additionally , a graviton flux , which falls on a picked out area ( cross - section ) , depends on the angle @xmath37 we have for the ratio of fluxes : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the fluxes which fall on @xmath35 under the angle @xmath33 and normally , @xmath41 is a square of side surface of a truncated cone with a base @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "= 12.98 cm    finally , we get for the factor @xmath42 @xmath43 by @xmath44 a formed cone contains self - intersections , and it is @xmath45 .",
    "by @xmath46 we have @xmath47 .",
    "after computation of simple integrals , we get : @xmath48 in the considered simplest case of the uniform non - expanding universe with the euclidean space , we shall have the quantity @xmath49 in a visible object diameter - luminosity connection if a whole redshift magnitude would caused by such an interaction with the background ( instead of @xmath50 for the expanding uniform universe ) . for near sources ,",
    "the estimate of the factor @xmath30 will be some increased one .",
    "the luminosity distance ( see @xcite ) is a convenient quantity for astrophysical observations .",
    "both redshifts and the additional relaxation of any photonic flux due to non - forehead collisions of gravitons with photons lead in our model to the following luminosity distance @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 .      to compare a form of this predicted dependence @xmath54 by unknown , but constant @xmath2 , with the latest observational supernova data by riess et al .",
    "@xcite , one can introduce distance moduli @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is an unknown constant ( it is a single free parameter to fit the data ) ; @xmath57 is the luminosity distance in units of @xmath58 .",
    "= 12.98 cm    in figure 2 , the hubble diagram @xmath59 is shown with @xmath60 to fit observations for low redshifts ; observational data ( 82 points ) are taken from table 5 of @xcite .",
    "the predictions fit observations very well for roughly @xmath6 .",
    "it excludes a need of any dark energy to explain supernovae dimming .",
    "discrepancies between predicted and observed values of @xmath59 are obvious for higher @xmath61 : we see that observations show brighter sne that the theory allows , and a difference increases with @xmath61 .",
    "it is better seen on figure 3 with a linear scale for @xmath57 ; observations are transformed as @xmath62 with the same @xmath60 . ; it might be partially caused by quickly raising contribution of a dispersion of measured flux : it should be proportional to @xmath63 . ]",
    "= 12.98 cm    it would be explained in the model as a result of specific deformation of sn spectra due to a discrete character of photon energy losses .",
    "today , a theory of this effect does not exist , and i explain its origin only qualitatively @xcite . for very small redshifts",
    "@xmath27 only a small part of photons transmits its energy to the background ( see below fig . 8 in section 6 ) .",
    "therefore any red - shifted narrow spectral strip will be a superposition of two strips .",
    "one of them has a form which is identical with an initial one , its space is proportional to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an average number of interactions of a single photon with the background , and its center s shift is negligible ( for a narrow strip ) .",
    "another part is expand , its space is proportional to @xmath66 and its center s shift is equal to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an average energy loss in one act of interaction .",
    "an amplitude of the red - shifted step should linear raise with a redshift .",
    "for big @xmath27 spectra of remote objects of the universe would be deformed .",
    "a deformation would appear because of multifold interactions of a initially - red - shifted part of photons with the graviton background .",
    "it means that the observed flux within a given passband would depend on a form of spectrum : the flux may be larger than an expected one without this effect if an initial flux within a next - blue neighbour band is big enough - due to a superposition of red - shifted parts of spectrum .",
    "some other evidences of this effect would be an apparent variance of the fine structure constant @xcite or of the cmb temperature @xcite with epochs . in both cases ,",
    "a ratio of red - shifted spectral line s intensities may be sensitive to the effect .",
    "this comparison with observations is very important ; to see some additional details , we can compute and graph the ratio @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is an observed analog of @xmath71 ( see fig .",

    "( without consideration of spin properties ) , gravitons should be described in the same manner as photons ( compare with @xcite ) , i.e. one can write for them : @xmath88 now let us introduce a new dimensional constant @xmath89 , so that for forehead collisions : @xmath90 then @xmath91 where @xmath92 is an average graviton energy . assuming @xmath93 and @xmath94 we get the following rough estimate for @xmath95 @xmath96 ( see below section 4.3 for more exact estimate of @xmath89 and for a theoretical estimate of @xmath2 ) that gives us the phenomenological estimate of cross - section by the same and equal @xmath11 and @xmath92 : @xmath97      we can introduce the following new constants ( see @xcite ) : @xmath98 which are analogues , on this new scale , of classical constants : the newton constant @xmath99 the planck length @xmath100 and the planck energy @xmath101 correspondingly .",

    "as it was reported by anderson s team @xcite , nasa deep - space probes ( pioneer 10/11 , galileo , and ulysses ) experience a small additional constant acceleration , directed towards the sun ( the pioneer anomaly ) . today , a possible origin of the effect is unknown .",
    "it must be noted here that the reported direction of additional acceleration may be a result of the simplest conjecture , which was accepted by the authors to provide a good fit for all probes .",
    "one should compare different conjectures to choose the one giving the best fit .",
    "we consider here a deceleration of massive bodies , which would give a similar deformation of cosmic probes trajectories @xcite .",
    "the one would be a result of interaction of a massive body with the graviton background , but such an additional acceleration will be directed against a body velocity .",
    "it follows from a universality of gravitational interaction , that not only photons , but all other objects , moving relative to the background , should lose their energy , too , due to such a quantum interaction with gravitons . if @xmath20 it turns out that massive bodies must feel a constant deceleration of the same order of magnitude as a small additional acceleration of cosmic probes .",
    "let us now denote as @xmath11 a full energy of a moving body which has a velocity @xmath123 relative to the background .",
    "then energy losses of the body by an interaction with the graviton background ( due to forehead collisions with gravitons ) on the way @xmath28 must be expressed by the same formula ( 1 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath124 if @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a time , and @xmath127 then we get for the body acceleration @xmath128 by a non - zero velocity : @xmath129 we assume here , that non - forehead collisions with gravitons give only stochastic deviations of a massive body s velocity direction , which are negligible . for small velocities : @xmath130 if the hubble constant @xmath2 is equal to @xmath131 ( it is the theoretical estimate of @xmath2 in this approach , see below section 4.3 ) , a modulus of the acceleration will be equal to @xmath132 that has the same order of magnitude as a value of the observed additional acceleration @xmath133 for nasa probes .",
    "we must emphasize here that the acceleration @xmath134 is directed against a body velocity only in a special frame of reference ( in which the graviton background is isotropic ) .",
    "in other frames , we may find its direction , using transformation formulae for an acceleration ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can assume that the graviton background and the microwave one are isotropic in one frame ( the earth velocity relative to the microwave background was determined in @xcite ) .    to verify my conjecture about the origin of probes additional acceleration , one could re - analyze radio doppler data for the probes .",
    "one should find a velocity of the special frame of reference and a constant probe acceleration @xmath134 in this frame which must be negative , as it is described above .",
    "these two parameters must provide the best fit for all probes , if the conjecture is true .",
    "in such a case , one can get an independent estimate of the hubble constant , based on the measured value of probe s additional acceleration : @xmath135 i would like to note that a deep - space mission to test the discovered anomaly is planned now at nasa by the authors of this very important discovery @xcite .    under influence of such a small additional acceleration @xmath134 , a probe must move on a deformed trajectory .",
    "its view will be determined by small seeming deviations from exact conservation laws for energy and angular momentum of a not - fully reserved body system which one has in a case of neglecting with the graviton background .",
    "for example , ulysses should go some nearer to the sun when the one rounds it .",
    "it may be interpreted as an additional acceleration , directed towards the sun , if we shall think that one deals with a reserved body system .",
    "it is very important to understand , why such an acceleration has not been observed for planets .",
    "this acceleration will have different directions by motion of a body on a closed orbit , and one must take into account a solar system motion , too . as a result , an orbit should be deformed",
    ". the observed value of anomalous acceleration of pioneer 10 should represent the vector difference of the two accelerations @xcite : an acceleration of pioneer 10 relative to the graviton background , and an acceleration of the earth relative to the background .",
    "possibly , the last is displayed as an annual periodic term in the residuals of pioneer 10 @xcite .",
    "if the solar system moves with a noticeable velocity relative to the background , the earth s anomalous acceleration projection on the direction of this velocity will be smaller than for the sun - because of the earth s orbital motion .",
    "it means that in a frame of reference , connected with the sun , the earth should move with an anomalous acceleration having non - zero projections as well on the orbital velocity direction as on the direction of solar system motion relative to the background . under some conditions ,",
    "the earth s anomalous acceleration in this frame of reference may be periodic .",
    "the axis of earth s orbit should feel an annual precession by it .",
    "this question needs a further consideration .",
    "it was shown by the author @xcite that screening the background of super - strong interacting gravitons creates for any pair of bodies both attraction and repulsion forces due to pressure of gravitons .",
    "for single gravitons , these forces are approximately balanced , but each of them is much bigger than a force of newtonian attraction .",
    "if single gravitons are pairing , an attraction force due to pressure of such graviton pairs is twice exceeding a corresponding repulsion force if graviton pairs are destructed by collisions with a body .",
    "in such the model , the newton constant is connected with the hubble constant that gives a possibility to obtain a theoretical estimate of the last .",
    "we deal here with a flat non - expanding universe fulfilled with super - strong interacting gravitons ; it changes the meaning of the hubble constant which describes magnitudes of three small effects of quantum gravity but not any expansion or an age of the universe .",

    "<S> it is shown by the author that if gravitons are super - strong interacting particles and the low - temperature graviton background exists , the basic cosmological conjecture about the dopplerian nature of redshifts may be false . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , a full magnitude of cosmological redshift would be caused by interactions of photons with gravitons . a new dimensional constant which characterizes one act of interaction </S>",
    "<S> is introduced and estimated . </S>",
    "<S> non - forehead collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific additional relaxation of any photonic flux . </S>",
    "<S> it gives a possibility of another interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> of course , all of these facts may implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> some features of a new paradigm are discussed here , too .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantum mechanism of classical gravity based on an existence of this sea of gravitons is described for the newtonian limit . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism needs graviton pairing and `` an atomic structure '' of matter for working it , and leads to the time asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> if the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the nature , then an existence of black holes contradicts to einstein s equivalence principle . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in this approach the two fundamental constants - hubble s and newton s ones - should be connected between themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical value of the hubble constant is computed . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , every massive body would be decelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be connected with the pioneer 10 anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the predicted and observed values of deceleration are in good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> some unsolved problems are discussed , so as possibilities to verify some conjectures in laser - based experiments . </S>"
