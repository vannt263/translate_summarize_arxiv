    "the mount wilson spectroscopic observations of main - sequence g and k stars @xcite have suggested the existence of two distinct branches of cycling stars , the active and inactive @xcite , and that the sun lies squarely between the two , thus appearing as a peculiar outlier @xcite . today , whether the solar dynamo and the related surface magnetic activity are typical or peculiar still remains an open question @xcite .",
    "finding solar - analog stars and studying their surface magnetic activity is a very promising way to understand solar variability and its associated dynamo @xcite .",
    "moreover , the study of the magnetic activity of solar analogs is also important for understanding the evolution of the sun and its environment in relation to other stars and the habitability of their planets .",

    "moreover , the length of the _ kepler _ dataset provides a unique source of information for detecting magnetic activity and the associated temporal variability in the acoustic oscillations .",
    "indeed , it is well established that in the case of the sun , p modes are sensitive to changes in the surface magnetic activity @xcite . moreover , the p - mode frequencies are the only proxy that can reveal inferences on sub - surface changes with activity that is not detectable at the surface by standard proxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite provided a definition of a solar - analog star based on the fundamental parameters ( e.g. , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . here , we took advantage of the combination of asteroseismology with high - resolution spectroscopy which substantially improves the accuracy of the stellar parameters and reduces their errors @xcite .",
    "we selected stars for which solar - like oscillations were detected in order to avoid very active stars @xcite .",

    "we note however that @xmath5 represents a lower limit of the photospheric activity as it depends on the inclination angle .",

    "a detailed description of the data processing of the hermes observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note that the result is dependent on the instrumental resolution and on the spectral type .",

    "the @xmath5 of the identified solar analogs is comparable to the sun , within the range of activity covered over a solar cycle .",
    "moreover , the two youngest solar analogs in our sample below 2gyr - old @xcite , which rotate in about 11  days , are the most active .",
    "the comparison between the @xmath7 and the @xmath1 magnetic activity proxies is shown on the right panel of fig .",

    "the values of @xmath1 were calibrated to the mount wilson observatory ( mwo ) system using the hermes scaling factor derived by @xcite .",
    "the mean values at minimum and maximum of solar activity are also represented .",
    "the resulting activity box corresponds to the range of change in solar activity along the 11-year magnetic cycle .",
    "although the sample of stars is small , the @xmath7 and @xmath1 indices are observed to be complementary , within the errors .",
    "we note also that both proxies were not estimated from contemporaneous _ kepler _ and hermes observations , introducing a dispersion partly related to possible temporal variations in stellar activity .",
    "nevertheless , it confirms that @xmath7 can complement the classical @xmath1  index for activity studies .",
    "with a rotation of @xmath911  days , the solar analog kic10644253 ( bd+472683 , @xmath10 ) is the youngest solar - like pulsating star observed by _ kepler _ with an age of @xmath11gyr @xcite and one of the most active @xcite .",
    "it is thus an excellent candidate for investigating the magnetic activity of a young sun with asteroseismic data .",
    "in addition to the sun , temporal variations of p - mode frequencies related to magnetic activity were so far observed in only three stars : the f - type stars hd49933 @xcite and kic3733735 @xcite , and the solar - analog g - type kic10644253 @xcite .    [ ]     to study the temporal variations of the low - degree , p - mode oscillation frequencies observed in kic10644253 , the _ kepler _ short - cadence dataset was split into contiguous 180-day - long sub series @xcite .",
    "the associated power spectra were analyzed using both peak - fitting @xcite and cross - correlation @xcite independent methods and the corresponding frequency shifts @xmath12 extracted .",
    "in addition , the light curve was analyzed to estimate the @xmath7 over sub series of @xmath13 days .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows that both the photospheric @xmath7 and the frequency shifts @xmath14 present the signature of magnetic activity variability .",
    "a modulation of about 1.5years is measured in both observables of about 900ppm for @xmath7 and 0.5@xmath15hz for the frequency shifts .",
    "it could be the signature of the short - period modulation , or quasi - biennal oscillation , of its magnetic activity as observed in the sun ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the variations found in kic10644253 at a rotation period of @xmath911  days is analogous to what is found by @xcite from the study of the temporal variations of the @xmath1 index in the solar analog hd30495 falling on the inactive branch @xcite .",
    "moreover , the comparison between magnitude and frequency dependence of the frequency shifts measured for kic10644253 with the ones obtained for the sun indicates that the same physical mechanisms are involved in the sub - surface layers in both stars .",
    "in addition , the analysis of the hermes spectroscopic observations shows that kic10644253 is @xmath918% chromospherically more active than the sun with an @xmath1 index of @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , the high lithium abundance of @xmath17dex and the effective temperature of @xmath18k mean that the lithium at the surface has not been depleted yet by internal processes @xcite .",
    "this is validating its young age estimated from seismology and in agreement with a rotation of @xmath911  days from gyrochronology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , among the 18 solar analogs in this sample , kic10644253 has the highest lithium abundance ( beck et al .",
    ", submitted ) .",
    "the study of the characteristics of the surface activity of solar analogs can provide new constraints in order to better understand the magnetic variability of the sun , and its underlying dynamo during its evolution .",
    "we analyzed here the sample of main - sequence stars observed by the _",
    "kepler _ satellite for which solar - like oscillations were detected and rotational periods measured and from published stellar parameters , we identified 18 seismic solar analogs .",
    "we then studied the properties of the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic activity of these stars in relation of the sun .",
    "the photospheric index @xmath7 was derived through the analysis of the _ kepler _ observations , while the chromospheric proxy @xmath1 was measured with follow - up , ground - based hermes spectroscopic observations .",
    "we showed that the magnetic activity of the sun is comparable to the activity of the seismic solar analogs studied here , within the maximum - to - minimum activity variations of the sun during the 11-year cycle .",
    "as expected , the youngest and fastest rotating stars are observed to be the most active of our sample .",
    "furthermore , the comparison of the photospheric index @xmath7 with the well - established chromospheric @xmath1  index shows that @xmath7 can be used to provide a suitable magnetic activity proxy .",
