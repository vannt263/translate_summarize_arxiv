    "nowadays magnetic fine particles  @xcite are routinely used in many technological applications such as magnetic recording  @xcite and magnetic resonance imaging  @xcite , and they are considered promising materials for various biomedical applications  @xcite and non  linear optics  @xcite . consequently , the study of their magnetic properties have attracted many efforts along the last decades , in particular because considerable deviations from bulk behavior have been widely reported for particle sizes below about 100 nanometers .",
    "this is because of finite - size effects and the increasing fraction of atoms lying at the surface with lower atomic coordination than in the core as the size of the particle decreases .",
    "in fact , magnetic properties at the particle surface are governed by the breaking of the lattice symmetry associated with several chemical and physical effects leading to a site - specific surface energy , usually taken as a local uniaxial anisotropy normal to the surface .",
    "generally , it is assumed that this local surface anisotropy averages over the whole particle surface giving rise to an effective uniaxial anisotropy acting on the net magnetization of the particle . in the nanometer range of sizes , the contribution of the surface anisotropy to the total effective anisotropy of the particle may be larger than that of the core , a fact which highly enlarges the characteristic switching time of the particle magnetization as a result of the increase in the effective energy barrier .",
    "actually , determining the characteristic switching time by studying the non - equilibrium dynamical response of the magnetization has been one of the most used methods to get an estimation of the effective value of the particle anisotropy per unit volume , which in many cases has been found to be one or two orders of magnitude greater than that corresponding to bulk counterpart and not proportional to the particle volume  @xcite .",
    "many experimental results  @xcite have been interpreted in terms of the phenomenological , ad  hoc , equation originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the effective anisotropy per volume unit of a spherical particle of diameter @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the core anisotropy energy per unit volume and @xmath9 is the effective surface anisotropy per unit of surface area which , in general , is assumed to be particle ",
    "size independent .",
    "the usually adopted assumption of radial surface anisotropy is not in contradiction with equation [ 1pd ] since , in real samples , departures form ideal spherical shape and surface roughness result in an effective uniaxial contribution to @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth noting that for spheroidal particles , @xmath11 contains the contributions coming from magnetocrystalline and shape anisotropy energies . besides @xmath12 is an effective uniaxial anisotropy which represents the height of the energy barrier per unit volume blocking the swithching of the particle magnetization . @xmath11 and @xmath10 are also treated as effective uniaxial anisotropies .    in eq .",
    "[ 1pd ] , the contributions of the core and surface to the total effective anisotropy are assumed to be solely additive excluding cross  linked effects . in spite of the simplicity of this assumption and",
    "the fact that there is not theoretical justification for it , eq .",
    "[ 1pd ] has been succesfully applied to show that experimental values of @xmath12 determined from ac susceptibility measurements scale with @xmath13 in some fine particle systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , magnetic resonance experiments in maghemite nanoparticles  @xcite have revealed an anisotropic contribution to the internal field associated with a positive uniaxial anisotropy originating at the particle surface which dominates over the cubic anisotropy contribution of the maghemite core and scales  @xcite with @xmath13 .",
    "the ad hoc assumption of a surface anisotropy normal to the particle surface and described by a uniform surface density @xmath9 has also been applied to the study of the magnetization and switching processes of a single particle in many numerical calculations based on atomistic monte carlo simulations  @xcite , landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation  @xcite and micromagnetics models  @xcite .",
    "many of the results of these calculations reproduce most of the anomalous properties associated with surface - anisotropy effects observed in fine particle systems . in particular , a simple phenomenological model based on this assumption  @xcite has been used to calculate the astroids corresponding to the phase diagrams for ellipsoidal particles which are in agreement with recent micro  squid experiments on isolated particles  @xcite .    at the moment , ref .",
    "@xcite constitutes the only attempt to assess the validity of eq .",
    "[ 1pd ] using an atomistic model for the surface anisotropy , namely the nel model  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the surface energy of a particle with a cubic lattice can be effectively represented by a first order uniaxial contribution due to particle elongation , which is proportional to @xmath9 and scales with the surface ; a second order contribution which is cubic in the net magnetization components , is proportional to @xmath14 and scales with the volume ; and a core  surface mixing contribution which is smaller than the other two contributions .",
    "correspondingly , the effective energy barrier of a particle could be consistent with eq .",
    "[ 1pd ] only for elongated particles but not for spherical or truncated octahedral ones .",
    "however , these conclusions have been drawn in the framework of a simple atomistic model for which there is not a general justification derived from more realistic modelizations of the crystal field , spin  orbit coupling , and disorder taking place at the surface atoms .    in this work ,",
    "we show that eq .",
    "[ 1pd ] may also account for the effective energy barriers of a size distribution of non - interacting spheroidal magnetic particles .",
    "we propose a method to evaluate the effective contribution of the surface and core anisotropies based on the comparison between the distributions of particle volumes , obtained from transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , and energy barriers calculated from thermoremanent magnetization measurements .",
    "this method is similar to that applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the power law dependence of the energy barrier on the particle volume in antiferromagnetic ferrihydrite nanoparticles .",
    "we show that the effective contribution of the particle surface to the total anisotropy energy can be well described by a size  independent value of the surface anisotropy density in accordance with eq .",
    "[ 1pd ] , which permits the superimposition of the two energy distributions corresponding to the particle core and total effective anisotropies .",
    "it is worth noting that relatively small values of the effective surface anisotropy density give rise to a dramatic broadening of the energy barrier distribution even for a narrow distribution of particle volumes .",
    "monodispersed iron oxide fe@xmath1o@xmath2 nanoparticles were synthesized by high temperature decomposition fe(iii)-acetylacetonate , coated by oleic acid and dispersed in hexane with extra oleic acid added as stabilizer  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was the sample called m5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the full structural characterization can be found .",
    "x - ray diffraction evidenced very good crystallinity , inverse spinel structure with lattice parameter @xmath15 nm , similar to that of bulk magnetite , and average particle diameter @xmath16 nm  @xcite .    the phase of the iron oxide particles and their stoichiometry were identified by mssbauer spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum recorded at 16 k was very similar to those reported for magnetite nanoparticles that have already undergone the verwey transition  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "9 in ref .",
    "this spectrum was fitted to five discrete sextets following a fitting model previously proposed by other authors  @xcite ( see table 4 in ref .",
    "three of the five components of the spectrum , amounting 73% of the total spectra area , showed values of the isomer shift less than 0.5 mm / s that may be attributed to fe@xmath17 ions in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the inverse spinel structure .",
    "the other two components showed values of the isomer shift greater than 0.6 mm / s and were attributed to fe@xmath18 ions lying in octahedral sites .",
    "therefore , the fe@xmath18 atomic fraction was 0.27 and the average stoichiometry of the particles was estimated to be fe@xmath19o@xmath2 .",
    "this result could be compatible with the presence of up to 21% of maghemite phase in the form of an overoxidized shell surrounding the particle core .",

    "particles were spheroidal in shape and very uniform in size , with polydispersity lower than 20 % of the mean size .",
    "the size distribution was determined measuring the internal diameter of about 3500 particles and the resultant hystogram was fitted to a poisson  like distribution function , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( in appropriate units for @xmath6 to be in nm ) . from the fitted function",
    "an average diameter @xmath24 nm with standard deviation @xmath25 nm was estimated .",
    "assuming that the particles are ellipsoidal in shape with equal minor axes , we evaluated the average value of the aspect ratio of about 100 particles to be @xmath26 with standard deviation @xmath27 .",
    "we only considered prolate shape , due to the difficulties in distinguishing prolate and oblate shapes in tem micorgraphs .",
    "magnetic measurements were carried out in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer in the temperature range within 1.8 and 200 k and in magnetic fields up to 5 t. the ac susceptibility was measured by appliying an ac field of 2 oe of amplitude and frequency within 0.1 and 1320 hz .",
    "magnetic relaxation at zero field and several temperatures were recorded after field cooling the sample under 50 oe from rooom temperature down to the measuring temperature , switching off the field and then recording the magnetization decay as a function of time .",
    "all the magnetic measurements were performed using a especial container for liquid suspensions .",
    "magnetization measurements revealed bulk  like saturation magnetization at 5 k , @xmath28 emu g@xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetization was measured increasing the temperature under an applied field of 50 oe after zero field cooling and field cooling ( zfc  fc experiment ) the sample from room temperature to 1.8 k. fig .",

    "the maximum of the zfc curve was located at a mean blocking temperature of about 15 k. the relatively small irreversibility between the zfc and fc curves above 15 k and the abrupt increase of the fc curve below this temperature were indicative of a non - interacting or very weak interacting superparamagnetic system of nanoparticles .",
    "the weiss temperature obtained extrapolating the reciprocal fc susceptibility in the superparamagnetic regime was also very small ( less than 1 k ) confirming a very weak strength of the interparticle interactions if they actually exist .",

    "mssbauer spectra in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the particles undergo a verwey transition at a certain temperature within 40 and 16 k , in accordance with previous results of other authors  @xcite for magnetite particles of similar size .",
    "the reduced value of the verwey temperature with respect to that of bulk magnetite may be due to finite size effects and/or the non  perfect stoichiometry of the particles .",
    "below the temperature at which the verwey transition takes place , magnetite is in a monoclinic configuration with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the effective unixial anisotropy along the [ 111 ] easy direction for stoichiometric magnetite  @xcite is @xmath32 erg @xmath33 and almost temperature independent below 40 k. this value of the uniaxial anisotropy is also a good approximation for that of partially oxidized magnetite  @xcite with the verwey transition occurring at a tempertaure above about 20 k , as in the case of the sample studied in this work .",
    "this is the effective bulk anisotropy that should be expected to contribute to the energy barriers blocking the particle magnetization in thermoremanent and ac magnetization experiments below about 20 k. it is worth noting that zfc - fc curves ( fig .",
    "[ mt ] ) did not show any anomaly associated with the verwey transition , likely due to smearing effects related to particle size distribution .",
    "taking into account that the nanoparticles are not perfect spheres we carried out a statistical evaluation of the shape anisotropy of about 100 particles from the tem images .",
    "we assumed the particles to be ellipsoids with equal minor axes .",
    "the average value was @xmath34 erg @xmath33 , which is one order of magnitude less than @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , shape anisotropy was neglected and a value @xmath36 erg @xmath33 was expected .      in order to obtain the effective distribution of energy barriers which block the switching of the net magnetization of the particles , we measured the magnetic relaxation of the sample at constant temperature ( thermoremanent magnetization ) towards a demagnetized state in zero applied field after a previous cooling in the presence of 50 oe ( fc process ) .",
    "the obtained relaxation curves corresponding to several temperatures were plotted as a function of the scaling variable @xmath37 , selecting an attempt time @xmath38 s that brought all the curves onto a single master curve  @xcite . due to inaccuracy in the determination of the initial value of the magnetization at each temperature ( the value of @xmath39 at @xmath40 )",
    ", it was also necessary to normalize the experimental data dividing them by an arbitrary reference magnetization value @xmath41 which was very close to @xmath42 .",
    "the opposite of the derivative of the master curve with respect to @xmath37 gave the distribution of energy barriers of the system  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ scaling ] shows the master curve for the relaxation data and its derivative as a function of the scaling variable . when magnetic interactions among particles are very weak if present , as in the case of the sample studied in this work , the distribution of energy barriers directly represents the distribution of the effective anisotropy of the particles .",
    "the contribution of the surface anisotropy to the effective anisotropy of the particle can be evaluated by simply comparing the distribution of energy barriers in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] with the distribution of anisotropies corresponding to the particle cores . to do that",
    ", the volume distribution was first calculated from the size distribution by transforming the particle diameter into volume assuming that the particles have spherical shape .",

    "we discuss a method to obtain the effective density of surface and core anisotropy energies by transforming the particle volume distribution into the total energy barrier distribution .      according to eq .",
    "[ 1pd ] , the total anisotropy energy of a single domain nanoparticle can be described in a simple model as the sum of two contributions , one proportional to its volume and another proportional to its surface area , in the form @xmath43 . assuming that the nanoparticle has spherical shape , one can rewrite the right hand of this equation in terms of the volume only , resulting in    @xmath44{36\\pi}k_s v^{2/3}.\\label{ev}\\ ] ]    in a statistical set of spherical , non - interacting nanoparticles the mean values of both sides of eq .",

    "<S> the effect of surface anisotropy on the distribution of energy barriers in magnetic fine particles of nanometer size is discussed within the framework of the @xmath0 scaling approach . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the distributions of the anisotropy energy of the particle cores , calculated by multiplying the volume distribution by the core anisotropy , and of the total anisotropy energy , deduced by deriving the master curve of the magnetic relaxation with respect to the scaling variable @xmath0 , enables the determination of the surface anisotropy as a function of the particle size . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the contribution of the particle surface to the total anisotropy energy can be well described by a size  independent value of the surface energy per unit area which permits the superimposition of the distributions corresponding to the particle core and effective anisotropy energies . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to a ferrofluid composed of non - interacting fe@xmath1o@xmath2 particles of 4.9 nm in average size and @xmath3 about 0.07 . </S>",
    "<S> even though the size distribution is quite narrow in this system , a relatively small value of the effective surface anisotropy constant @xmath4 erg @xmath5 gives rise to a dramatic broadening of the total energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of the average value of the effective anisotropy constant , deduced from magnetic relaxation data , is verified by comparing it to that obtained from the analysis of the shift of the ac susceptibility peaks as a function of the frequency . </S>"
