    "cygnus x-3 ( cyg x-3 ) is a well - known microquasar that contains a wolf ",
    "rayet star and a compact object , the nature and mass of which are still not known ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "giant radio outbursts from cyg x-3 have been observed once every few years since their first discovery .",
    "very long baseline interferometry observations of these outbursts revealed that cyg x-3 sometimes has a bipolar relativistic jet ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and sometimes has a one - sided jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "these relativistic jets are presumably the remnants of ejection from the flares . in addition , cyg x-3 was first detected in the gev @xmath2-ray regime in 2009 by the fermi ( @xcite ) and agile ( @xcite ) satellites .",
    "williams et al . reported that a radio flare was followed by a @xmath2-ray flare(@xcite ) .",
    "the close relationship between radio and @xmath2-ray flares is also supported by new observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the centimeter wave emission from cyg",
    "x-3 has been monitored by several groups , even during the quiescent phase ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the green bank interferometer at 5 ghz and the ryle telescope at 15 ghz have revealed the detailed behavior of radio emission from cyg x-3 with a high time resolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the centimeter radio emission changes gradually over a time scale of 1 h or less .",
    "in contrast , the time scale of the change during outbursts is shorter at higher frequency . in particular ,",
    "the time scale for millimeter waves is much shorter than that for centimeter waves ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the giant outbursts of cyg x-3 are presumed to consist of a series of short - duration flares . in previous research ,",
    "a millimeter wave monitor with sufficient time coverage and high time resolution found a new transient phenomenon of cyg x-3 : a flux density change with an e - folding rise time of 3.6 min or less in the millimeter light curve ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , such flares in the giant outburst are too crowded together to discriminate the physical parameters of a single flare , even in the millimeter wave region .",
    "ascertaining these parameters is vital for exploring the mechanism of the flares .    accordingly , to obtain light curves that do not suffer from the interference of successive flares",
    ", observations were performed in the millimeter wave region at a high time resolution during quiescent phase of cyg x-3 by using the 45-m radio telescope at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro45 ) .",
    "this telescope has wide frequency coverage from 20 to 100 ghz .",
    "studying the behavior of flares at different frequencies also provided important information for exploring the mechanism of the flares .",
    "we monitored the flux density of cyg x-3 in the quiescent phase at a high time resolution ( 410 min ) by using nro45 at 23 , 43 , and 86 ghz for 20 days during the period from 2006 to 2010 .    to conduct the observations , a cooled high electron mobility transistor receiver with a dual circular polarization feed was used at 23.0 ghz",
    "however , observations at 23 ghz were performed only in 2006 because changing the frequency between 23 ghz and 43 and 86 ghz required a dead time of 5 min , which we judged to be a long time when compared with the time scale of cyg x-3 phenomena .",
    "superconductor - insulator - superconductor receivers with orthogonal linear polarization feeds were used to make observations at 43.0 and 86.0 ghz .",
    "the frequency bandwidth of these receivers is 500 mhz .",
    "the system noise temperatures during the observations , including atmospheric effects and antenna ohmic loss , were 80120 k at 23 ghz , 120200 k at 43 ghz , and 250350 k at 86 ghz .",
    "the full width at half - maximum values of the telescope beams were @xmath3 at 23 ghz , @xmath4 at 43 ghz , and @xmath5 at 86 ghz . to remove any atmospheric effects ,",
    "the telescope beam was alternated at 15 hz between the position of the source and a region of blank sky 6 from the source in the azimuth direction by a beam switch .",
    "the telescope was position - switched between an on - source position at @xmath6 and a region of blank sky at @xmath7 , where the duration at each position was 8 s / cycle .",
    "the antenna temperatures were calibrated by a chopper wheel method .",
    "the primary flux calibrator for the conversion from antenna temperature to flux density was a proto - planetary nebula , ngc 7027 , whose flux density values are given as 5.5 jy at 22 ghz , 5.0 jy at 43 ghz , and 4.6 jy at 86 ghz ( @xcite ) .",
    "telescope pointing was checked and corrected in every observation procedure by viewing ngc 7027 in cross - scan mode .",
    "the pointing accuracy was better than @xmath8 root mean square during the observations .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux density of cyg x-3 depends on the weather conditions .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the telescopes is not a principal factor in the uncertainty . because the primary flux - scale calibrator , ngc 7027 , is close to cyg x-3 in the celestial sphere and the difference in atmospheric attenuation between these sources is calibrated by the chopper wheel method",
    ", there is no significant effect on the flux density data .",
    "the typical systematic uncertainty for nro45 is 10% ; however , the relative uncertainties in the flux density on any particular day should be much less than this value because the observations were performed under fine weather conditions .",
    "from the 20 days of monitoring during the quiescent phase of cyg x-3 , we found two isolated flares , at mjd @xmath9 ( 15 march 2006 ut ) and at mjd @xmath10 ( may 20 2009 ut ) .",
    "we observed the whole episode of these flares without contamination from successive flares .",
    "there was no isolated flare with statistical significance on other days .",
    "the complete monitoring data will be published in a future paper .",
    "figure 1a shows the light curves of the flare at mjd@xmath11 at 23 , 43 , and 86 ghz .",
    "the mjd @xmath9 flare was found in the post - bursting phase of the giant outburst in spring 2006 .",
    "the flux densities rapidly increased to a peak around mjd @xmath12 . unfortunately , because calibration was performed near the peak , there is a break in the data .",
    "the maximum flux densities were at least @xmath13 jy at 43 ghz and @xmath14 jy at 86 ghz , where the error includes only statistical error .",
    "the time scales of the e - folding rise , @xmath15 , were below @xmath16 min at 43 ghz and @xmath17 min at 86 ghz . in an earlier paper ( @xcite ) , we reported an abrupt large - amplitude change in flux density with an e - folding rise time of 4 min or less in light curves at 100 ghz ( @xcite ) . the time scales shown in figure 1a are similar to the previous value .",
    "in contrast , the flux density appears to change more gradually at 23 ghz than at 43 ghz and 86 ghz , suggesting that the time scale becomes longer at lower frequency .",
    "however , the time lag between 43 and 86 ghz is not clear .",
    "the absence of time lag is similar to that seen for light curves at 100 ghz ( @xcite ) . after the intensity peak ,",
    "the flux densities then exponentially decayed .",
    "the lifetimes ( @xmath18 ) of the fluxes were @xmath19 days at 23 ghz ( dotted line in figure 1a ) , @xmath20 days at 43 ghz ( broken line in figure 1a ) , and @xmath21 days at 86 ghz ( solid line in figure 1a ) . here , the initial time of the flare , @xmath22 , is assumed to be the same as the time at the peak flux density , @xmath23 in mjd .",
    "the lifetime of the flux was much shorter at higher frequency .",
    "in addition , there might be a plateau around mjd @xmath24@xmath25 in the flux density at 86 ghz .",
    "a plateau was not clearly seen in the flux densities at 23 and 43 ghz .",
    "figure 2a shows the radio spectral index of cyg x-3 at mjd @xmath9 .",
    "the values are derived from the inclination between the flux densities at 43 and 86 ghz .",
    "the radio spectrum of cyg x-3 is inverted , @xmath26(@xmath27 ) , around the peak flux density .",

    "these lifetimes are consistent with those in figure 1a .",
    "there might also be a plateau in the flux density at 86 ghz around mjd @xmath36@xmath37 .",
    "in contrast to the first flare , a similar feature is also observed at 43 ghz .",

    "the brightness temperature of the emitting region , @xmath45 , is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the distance of cyg x-3 and @xmath48 is boltzmann conatatnt ( @xcite ) .",
    "this brightness temperature is larger than @xmath49 k , assuming that cyg x-3 is located at a distance of @xmath50 kpc .",
    "the observed spectrum of the flares around the peak is flat or inverted between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ghz .",
    "if the emission is completely optically thick in the frequency range , the spectral index should be @xmath53 for relativistic electrons with a power energy spectrum , @xmath54 .",

    "on the other hand , the turnover frequency in the flares is estimated to be @xmath60 ghz , owing to the observed flares showing a flat or inverted spectrum between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ghz .",
    "the magnetic field strength at the peak is calculated to be @xmath61 g and the cooling time of the electrons , @xmath62 , is estimated to be @xmath63\\sim \\frac{1}{2}c_{12}\\times h_{\\bot}[\\mathrm{g}]^{-\\frac{3}{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 ( see eq . 7.7 in @xcite ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is @xmath65 g , the cooling time is @xmath66 h , which is consistent with no change occurring in the spectral index during the observed exponential decay .",
    "the exponential decay is assumed to be caused by the decrease in the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "assuming equipartition between the magnetic field and the electrons , the minimum energy of the source to account for the observed synchrotron emission is approximated by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the ratio between the energy in protons and that in electrons ; this ratio is assumed to be zero hereafter @xcite .",
    "the minimum power given to the electrons is found by dividing the minimum energy by the time scale of the e - folding rise @xmath69 : @xmath70 the power is comparable with those estimated from flux densities at low frequencies , whose rise time scales are longer .    from the assumption of equipartition , the magnetic field strength ,",
    "@xmath71 , is @xmath72 note that the equipartition magnetic field strength , @xmath73 g , is of the same order as the strength of @xmath74 g , obtained from the turnover frequency .    the ratio of the inverse - compton scattering loss , @xmath75 , and the synchrotron radiation loss , @xmath76 , for the relativistic electrons is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the radiation energy density and the magnetic energy density , respectively ( see eq . 5.60 in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the inverse - compton scattering loss dominates the synchrotron radiation loss , the lifetime of the relativistic electron would be so short that the emission would be invisible .",
    "therefore , we set the ratio @xmath80 by assuming that the spectral index is flat until @xmath81 ghz . in this case , the magnetic field is greater than @xmath82 g and thus , the magnetic field strength of cyg x-3 is estimated to be in the range @xmath1 g.",
    "we performed millimeter wave monitor observations of cyg x-3 in quiescent phases between giant outbursts at 23 , 43 , and 86 ghz by using the nro45 radio telescope .",
    "we found two isolated flares with amplitude 0.52 jy , for which the light curves did not suffer from successive flares .",
