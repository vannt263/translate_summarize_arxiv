    "there is growing observational evidence that large - scale lopsided asymmetry is a common phenomenon in spiral galaxies , as seen in the stellar distribution ( e.g. , block et al .",
    "1994 , rix & zaritsky 1995 , bournaud et al . 2005 ) as well as in the distribution of the atomic hydrogen gas ( e.g. , baldwin et al . 1980 , hence bls , richter & sancisi 1994 , haynes et al .",
    "these observations show that about 30% of the field spirals show significant disc lopsidedness .",
    "various theoretical explanations have been put forward towards explaining the physical origin of the lopsided mass distribution in spiral galaxies .",
    "some of these are : the disc response to a distorted halo ( jog 1997 , 1999 ) , satellite infall onto a galaxy ( zaritsky & rix 1997 ) , and tidal interaction and asymmetric gas accretion onto a galactic disc ( bournaud et al . 2005 ) .",
    "cooperation of orbital streams to the lopsided pattern was used to drive the lopsided instabilities in disc galaxies ( earn & lynden - bell 1996 ) .",
    "lovelace et al . ( 1999 ) found strongly unstable eccentric motions within one disc scalelength , and the model with an off - centred disc w.r.t .",
    "the halo by levine & sparke ( 1998 ) also shows lopsidedness in the inner regions- but both these do not give lopsidedness in the outer regions where it is seen in galaxies .",
    "so far some theoretical studies have shown that lopsided instabilities exist only in counter - rotating stellar discs in which the fraction of retrograde stars is large ( hozumi & fujiwara 1989 ; sellwood & valluri 1997 ) . since",
    "counter rotation is a rarely seen phenomenon in stellar discs ( kuijken , fisher , & merrifield 1996 ; kannappan & fabricant 2001 ) it leaves a room for the search of lopsided instability in normal differentially rotating galactic discs .",
    "a kinematic origin for lopsidedness in stellar disc indicates a short winding - up time scale which is less than a gyr ( bls ) .",
    "n - body simulations show the disc lopsidedness to be long - lived to @xmath1 3 - 4 gyr , however the physical reason for this is not understood .",
    "it has been shown that in field galaxies , the disc lopsidedness is uncorrelated to the strength of tidal interaction ( bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ) , or the presence of nearby companions ( wilcots & prescott 2005 ) .",
    "the latter point is exemplified by the case of m101 which is an isolated galaxy and yet is strongly lopsided .",
    "thus , an internal origin for the generation of the disc lopsidedness is worth investigating . because it has the potential to provide answer to the question : why are so many isolated galaxies lopsided ?",
    "this provides the motivation for our present work .",
    "the two main observed characteristics of the disc lopsidedness are that : first , a@xmath0 , the fractional fourier amplitude of lopsidedness increases smoothly with radius as seen in rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) , bournaud et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and measured between 1.5 - 2.5 disc scalelengths .",
    "second , the phase of lopsidedness is nearly constant with radius ( rix & zaritsky 1995 , angiras et al .",
    "the latter indicates that the disc lopsidedness is a global feature ( e.g. , jog 1997 ) .",
    "guided by these observed features , in this paper , we study self - consistently the behaviour of the global lopsided perturbation in a purely exponential galactic disc using the fluid dynamical approach .",
    "the lopsidedness emerges as a global instability arising due to the collective effect of the self - gravity of the perturbation in the disc .",
    "the resulting pattern speed is almost constant with radius and thus avoids the winding up problem due to the differential precession . in our picture",
    ", the lopsidedness manifests itself as a classic case of the negative damping phenomenon in a self - gravitating system .",
    "note that the modes with @xmath2 symmetry have in general no inner lindblad resonance in the disc .",
    "so refraction and dissipation of acoustic waves is less of a problem ( block et al .",
    "1994 ) . unlike the usual @xmath3 spiral pattern",
    ", there exists no definite pattern speed measurement for the @xmath2 lopsided mode in the galactic disc .    for simplicity and to separate the various different dynamical mechanisms , we treat the lopsidedness in a purely exponential stellar galactic disc and disregard the effect of halo .",
    "we also postpone the treatment of a dissipative component . in a future paper",
    ", we will include the effect of halo and treat a similar global calculation that is applicable to the atomic hydrogen gas located at larger radii .",
    "we tackle the existence of global @xmath2 mode both from analytical development , and through numerical simulations .",
    "we organise the paper in the following way : in section 2 we formulate the dynamical equations governing the lopsided mode in the disc and provide a numerical scheme for solving the matrix eigenvalue equation .",
    "the results from this linear approach are described in section 3 .",
    "section 4 describes the n - body simulations of a pure stellar disc , and the study of the @xmath2 modes .",
    "the comparison between the two approaches are compared and interpreted in section 5 .",
    "section 6 summarizes our conclusion .",
    "we formulate here the dynamical equations governing the global lopsided mode in a thin , initially axisymmetric self - gravitating disc having an exponential distribution of surface density ( @xmath4 ) . by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium along the vertical direction",
    ", we ignore the vertical structure of the disc by integrating all physical quantities over z. the disc is differentially rotating with angular speed @xmath5 so that the unperturbed velocity field in the plane is given by @xmath6 .",
    "we write the velocity field , surface density , potential and the pressure of the perturbed disc as : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ".    then the linearized euler and continuity equations in the cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath12 ) can be written as : @xmath13 in the above equations @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the epicyclic frequency in the disc .",
    "we consider two separate cases namely a cold disc and a hot disc throughout this paper . in the case of a cold disc ,",
    "the equlibrium state is defined by a balance between the differential rotation and the softened gravity .",
    "whereas in the equilibrium state , a hot disc is supported by the differential rotation and pressure against the softened gravity . since we are primarily interested in the stability properties of the global lopsided modes(@xmath2 ) in the disc , we consider all the perturbed variables as @xmath16 about the equilibrium state .",
    "stability of the mode depends on the sign of the imaginary part of @xmath17 ( im(@xmath17 ) ) .",
    "lopsided modes in the disc become unstable , in other words they are self - excited , when im(@xmath17 ) @xmath18 .",
    "they are stable decaying modes when im(@xmath17)@xmath19 .",
    "modes with im(@xmath17 ) @xmath20 are in general stationary van kampen modes ; outside the continuum , these modes are pure normal mode oscillation of the whole disc .",
    "we study here the slowly varying ( @xmath21 ) global lopsided mode using softened self - gravity and the pressure as the dominant collective effect in the disc . in effect",
    "we aim to study here the lopsidedness in a real galactic disc .",
    "the effect of softened self - gravity was studied earlier on the slow modes in keplerian discs by tremaine ( 2001 ) .",
    "we first neglect the collective effects due to the pressure in the stellar disc in order to bring out clearly the effect of self - gravity in governing the properties of these large - scale global modes in the galactic disc .",
    "then we include the effect of velocity dispersion to study how the behaviour of lopsidedness changes in the hot disc . substituting the above form of the perturbed variables into eqs.(1 - 3 ) and solving for the velocity field in the limit @xmath21 we obtain :    @xmath22 \\eqno(4)\\ ] ]    @xmath23 \\eqno(5)\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 @xmath25    in the above expressions @xmath26 is the free precession frequency of the @xmath2 lopsided mode and @xmath27 in the disc under consideration .",
    "interestingly , note that the ratio of the two velocities is no longer a simple scalar as it is in the keplerian limit ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "substituting the perturbed variables in continuity equation and simplifying the equation by using the limit @xmath21 we get :    @xmath29    now connecting the velocity field(eqs.[4 - 5 ] ) with the continuity eq.(6 ) and performing straightforward mathematical manipulations we arrive at the following compact equation :    @xmath30    where @xmath31\\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : \\ : ( 9a)\\\\ \\mathcal{s}(\\sigma^{\\prime},\\phi^{\\prime } ) & = \\omega_p^2 \\sigma^{\\prime } + \\omega_p ( \\mathcal{o}_{g}^{1 } \\phi^{\\prime } + \\mathcal{o}_{p}^{1 } \\sigma^{\\prime } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32    in deriving the above eq.(8 ) we have used the fact that the vertically integrated pressure is a function of the surface density @xmath33 . in particular we have used the perturbed pressures as @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "we consider a constant q value for the disc .",
    "note that by considering a constant q we are making the perturbed pressures arbitrary by that constant . since we do not have an apriori knowledge about the components of the stress tensor ( hence a correct pressure ) from the equations of motion , we are justified in playing around with the constant q to evalute the perturbed pressures for our analysis .",
    "our analysis for a cold disc ( q=0 ) remains unaffected by such assumption .",
    "a proper variation of q on the radial co - ordinate will be considered in a later work .",
    "now we require the perturbed surface density ( @xmath56 ) and the potential ( @xmath57 ) to be connected through the poisson equation in order to produce a self - consistent solution of the problem ( eq.[8 ] ) .",
    "this we achieve using the integral form of the poisson equation for the perturbed disc under the imposed @xmath2 lopsided mode :    @xmath58    where the kernel in eq.(17 ) is given by @xmath59^{\\frac{1}{2 } } }   - \\pi \\frac{r}{{r^{\\prime}}^2 } \\eqno(18)\\ ] ]    the kernel represents the softened self - gravity of the perturbation , @xmath60 being the softening parameter .",
    "this allows us to perform the numerical integration over the nearby rings by removing the singularity at @xmath61 .",
    "we will discuss the effect of this softening parameter as we progress .",
    "the second indirect term ( papaloizou , 2002 ) in the above kernel arises due to the @xmath2 lopsided mass distribution about the geometrical centre of the disc .",
    "the indirect term plays a crucial role in making the disc susceptible to the lopsided instability .",
    "the importance of the indirect term is discussed in various places in the paper .    substituting the perturbed potential ( eq.[17 ] ) into eq.(8 )",
    "we can arive at the following equation :    @xmath62    where @xmath63    @xmath64    the kernels in the integrals of the above eq.(20a ) and eq.(20b ) are given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the above integro - differential equation ( eq.[19 ] ) describes the global behaviour of the @xmath2 lopsided mode under the collective effects of self - gravity and pressure in the disc .",
    "eq.(19 ) can be solved by recasting it into a matrix - eigenvalue problem . by discretizing on a uniform grid with @xmath67 radial points in the disc we can write eq.(19 ) in a compact form :    @xmath68 \\sigma_{lop } \\:=\\ : 0 \\eqno(21)\\ ] ]    where i , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the three @xmath71 real square matrices .",
    "we call @xmath69 as the general damping matrix and @xmath70 as the stiffness matrix for the galactic disc divided into @xmath67 concentric rings in analogy with the nomenclature of linear mechanical systems .",
    "note that the damping , in our discrete @xmath67 ring system i.e. in the disc , can either be positive or negative in nature .",
    "_ negative damping will lead to a self - excitation of the discrete normal modes in the disc_. in the above equation @xmath72 is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath73 .",
    "the matrix elements are evaluated below : @xmath74 @xmath75    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 we use the method of finite difference to evaluate the contribution to the matrix elements from the pressure terms e.g.@xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "eq.(21 ) represents an @xmath67-dimensional quadratic eigenvalue problem(qep ) in the eigenvalue @xmath73 and @xmath67-dimensional eigenvector @xmath72 describing the lopsided perturbation surface density in the disc .",
    "we consider @xmath80 rings uniformly spaced up to an outer boundary @xmath81 which we keep as a free parameter in our study .",
    "since the original eq.(19 ) is an integro - differential equation we need to supply boundary conditions to solve the matrix problem .",
    "we use the neumann boundary conditions @xmath82 on the boundary in order to evaluate the contributions to the matrix elements from the pressure terms .",

    "the above boundary condition is used only to solve the govering equation in a hot disc . for a cold disc",
    ", we do not need to impose any external boundary condition ; the boundary condition is in - built in the integral equation .",
    "the standard way to solve the qep ( eq . [ 21 ] ) is to reduce it to a generalized eigenvalue problem(gep ) .",
    "we use lapack subroutines for the numerical solution of our gep . for more numerical details see saha & jog ( 2006 ) and relevant references therein .",
    "we study the lopsided mode in a galactic exponential disc with the central surface density @xmath83 and a scale - length @xmath84 : @xmath85 as observed in most spiral galaxies ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "we limit our investigations up to @xmath86 disc scale - lengths , typically within the optical region , which contains @xmath87 of the total stellar disc mass .",
    "we do not include the effect of the dark matter halo in the present problem since different dynamical mechanisms will then be involved , and we want to examine them in turn .    in all the calculations we get the perturbation surface density i.e. eigenvector @xmath72 ( eq.[21 ] ) in a dimensionless form and the eigenvalues @xmath73 corresponding to the eigenvector are in units of @xmath88 . for disc like our milky way the value of this unit @xmath89 km@xmath90kpc@xmath91 .",
    "we first consider here a cold self - gravitating disc i.e a disc with zero velocity dispersion .",
    "the unperturbed disc is rotationally supported against the gravitational attraction .",
    "the underlying motivation is to find out how the behaviour of lopsidedness ( @xmath2 mode ) in a differentially rotating cold self - gravitating disc changes when a finite non - zero velocity dispersion is included in the disc .",
    "below we report the results first for a cold disc and subsequently the results from the hot disc are discussed .",
    "we show that the cold self - gravitating discs are able to support @xmath2 discrete normal lopsided modes .",
    "these modes are important because they show the observational signatures and they also turn out to be long - lived as discussed below .      in fig .",
    "1 we have shown four subplots of the lopsided modes at various values of the outer boundary @xmath81 . the @xmath67-dimensional matrix eigenvalue equation ( eq.[21 ] ) produces @xmath92 eigenvalues and @xmath92 eigenvectors in the disc .",
    "observationally relevant modes are actually the lowest frequency ground state modes . by ground state",
    "we mean the mode with the lowest value of the real part of the eigenvalue ( re(@xmath73 ) ) in the eigen spectrum .",
    "these modes are with the lowest number of nodes , typically zero or one node at most , showing the global nature of the lopsidedness in the disc . for smaller sized disc ( as shown in the first two panels in fig .",
    "( 1 ) ) these modes are very interesting in nature , they are discrete and distinct ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "( 4 ) ) , in the sense that these modes represent a very slowly precessing stationary lopsided pattern .",
    "the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues corresponding to these pattern are zero i.e. im(@xmath73)=0 for these modes .",
    "however as we increase the disc size this scenario changes and collective effect due to disc self - gravity becomes very important .",
    "we find that for a comparatively larger disc the most slowly precessing pattern appears as an instability in the system .",
    "the reason for this instability lies in the collective effect due to the softened self - gravity . even though its hard to exactly pinpoint the source of the lopsided instability , our numerical analysis show that without the indirect term the ground - state lopsided modes are never unstable in the disc .",
    "we have used the value of softening parameter @xmath60 @xmath1 some fraction of the inter ring spacings in order to solve the matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "we show that the mode shape corresponding to the lowest pattern speed is quite robust with respect to the variations in both the parameters namely @xmath81 and @xmath60 . in figs.1a - 1d ,",
    "we have varied @xmath81 from @xmath93 to @xmath94 and clearly in all these cases the mode amplitudes increase with the galactocentric radius , in a good agreement with the observations ( section 1 ) .",
    "the surface density contours for the lopsided disc : @xmath95 are shown in fig .",
    "we have considered @xmath96 and the contours are at t=0 .",
    "this clearly brings out that the contours deviate from the unperturbed disc surface density more at larger radii . a barycentric shift in the mass distribution of the disc due to",
    "the lopsided mode is obvious from fig.2 .",
    "such a displacement of the center of mass of the disc due to a one - armed spiral mode is discussed in great detail in evans & reed , 1998 .",
    "they show that a one - armed spiral does not shift the barycentre of the disc substantially .",
    "the lopsided mode in our analysis seems to precess with a very slow pattern speed ( as can be seen in fig.3 and fig.8 ) .",
    "because of this slow pattern of oscillation we expect the barycentre of the disc to be shifted only by a small amount and the mass distribution of the disc does not alter appreciably ; it probably stays in that state for a long time .",
    "however , since in the linear regime the amplitude of the lopsided surface density is arbitrary , we do not think it is possible to calculate the exact shift of the barycentre due to the lopsided pattern .",
    "so our study - based on the internal disc dynamics- naturally explains the observational fact that the lopsidedness increases outward in the disc .      in order to achieve a persistent lopsided pattern in the disc ,",
    "the pattern formed initially by the stellar orbits should be synchronized in such a way that they rotate with a constant pattern speed . in the kinematical picture",
    "this requires that the differential precession in @xmath97 must be zero which is true in a keplerian disc because the disc self - gravity is insignificant and the lopsided pattern would remain intact there for all time . in a sharp contrast , in a galactic stellar disc , it is the self - gravity which is the most important . so the survival of lopsidedness in the stellar disc is puzzling .",
    "the strong differential precession in @xmath98 in the inner region would wash away any coherent pattern imposed onto it . the typical winding up time scale for the lopsided pattern",
    "can be obtained by using the formula @xmath99 ( see bls ) .",
    "their estimation shows that the typical lifetime of the lopsided pattern seen in outer hi disc is @xmath100 gyr . for a typical stellar disc like that of our galaxy this",
    "winding up time scale in the optical region would be less than a gyr .",
    "so in the stellar disc the survival problem of the lopsidedness is far more severe .    in fig .",
    "3 we have shown the variation of the @xmath101 , denoting the pattern speed of the lopsided mode in the exponential disc , with respect to the size of the disc . the eigenfrequencies @xmath73 are corresponding to the ground - state lopsided mode in the disc .",
    "we see that @xmath101 is almost constant compared to the variation in @xmath97 and thereby the disc avoids the differential precession . in this way",
    "the winding - up time scale increases by a factor of @xmath1 10 or more and this turns out to be more than 12 gyr for a disc like that of our galaxy .",
    "this implies that the lowest frequency modes are almost non - rotating pattern of the disc and n - body simulations ( as described later in sec.4 ) confirms this picture . note that in all our calculations @xmath101 lie in between the gap made by @xmath97 and @xmath102 which act as the lower and upper boundary of the continuum region respectively .",
    "in other words we have @xmath103 .",
    "all the ground - state lopsided modes in our calculations are thus discrete in nature ; once @xmath101 lies outside this gap they fall in the continuum regime .",
    "we show that as the disc size increases the width of the gap shrinks and eventually any discrete lopsided mode ceases to exist ! and this phenomenon occurs at a region near 4.6 disc scale - lengths where @xmath104 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "surprisingly there is a natural resonance at @xmath105 at around 4.6 disc scale - lengths .",
    "so we see that vanishing of the discrete lopsided modes occurs below this resonance and this might be acting naturally as a boundary beyond which no discrete lopsided mode can exist in a purely exponential disc .",
    "3 also brings out another fact clearly regarding the sense of precession of the lopsided pattern in the cold disc . in linear analysis the final equation ( 21 ) is invarinat under the transformation @xmath106 , one would expect the pattern speed to be both retrograde and prograde .",
    "our numerical eigenvalue analysis shows that both the retrograde and prograde pattern are likely to occur in the cold disc .",
    "some of the earlier works namely statler ( 1999 ) has argued that the precession of a self - consistent lopsided disc must be prograde ; jacobs & sellwood ( 2001 ) find in their simulation that the lopsided modes precess in prograde direction .",
    "on solving the n - dimensional eigenvalue problem ( eq.[21 ] ) in the case of cold discs ( q=0 ) with different disc sizes , we obtain 2n complex eigenvalues and these complex eigenvalues are plotted in the _ argand _ diagram as shown in fig.4 .",
    "the complete eigen spectrum in the case of spiral and bar - like structures in galaxies are discussed by polyachenko , 2004 .",
    "the complex eigenvalues appear as complex conjugate pairs in the full spectrum . in the argand diagram",
    ", we will concentrate only to those points for which re(@xmath73 ) @xmath1 0 since we are primarily interested in the slow modes . for smaller sized disc as in panel - a",
    ", there exists a distinct ( clearly separated from the rest of the points in the complex plane ) point in the discrete region close to the boundary of the lower continuum ( denoted by the vertical solid line ) corresponding to re(@xmath73 ) @xmath1 0 and im(@xmath73)=0 .",
    "the mode corresponding to this point is an almost non - rotating stationary global lopsided pattern of the disc . being isolated in the argand diagram",
    "_ this mode resembles like an excited normal mode of the disc _ much like what lynden - bell in 1965 first conjectured in the context of warps ( basically @xmath2 mode in the perpendicular direction to the disc midplane ) that they are excited normal modes of the discs .",
    "the existence of such a mode of oscillation outside the continuum was shown by mathur , 1990 for one dimensional and 3d gravitating system . _",
    "the presence of such a distinct normal mode in our eigen solution for a disc - like 2d self - gravitating system confirms the previous trend found in theoretical studies namely self - gravitating system supports normal modes of oscillation in the disc_.    interestingly , note the appearance of a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues in the continuum region near the solid line in panel - a .",
    "as the disc size increases this pair drifts towards the discrete region from the continuum and at around 4 disc scale lengths , they are in the discrete region .",
    "and the slowly precessing stationary pattern turns out to be a lopsided instablity in the cold disc .",
    "this instability , in comparatively larger discs , arises due to the collective effect of the softened self - gravity of the perturbation where the indirect term place a crucial role in driving the instability .",
    "whereas for smaller sized discs , which are like a broad annular ring , the collective effect of softened self - gravity is not enough to drive an instability and the lopsided pattern basically represents a stationary oscillation of the whole disc .",
    "apart from the discrete region , the complete eigen spectrum contains a lot of modes in the continuum region . for a cold disc only a few of these modes",
    "are with im(@xmath73)=0 representing stationary oscillation in the system .",
    "these particular normal modes ( as shown in fig.5 ) are interesting because they resemble the van kampen modes in plasma physics .",
    "these modes would probably decay by landau damping and hence are of no interest in our present study .      in reality",
    "galactic discs are never cold . because of a non - zero velocity dispersion",
    "a hot disc is supported by rotation as well as pressure against the gravitation .",
    "we quantify the hotness of the discs by the toomre s q ( eq.[16 ] ) parameter ; note that q=0 refers to a cold disc and q@xmath1070 means a hot disc .",
    "if q is less than the critical value of 1 , the disc is axisymmetrically unstable .",
    "basically q serves as a very useful local criterion for the axisymmetric stability of the disc .",
    "normally q has a radial profile in the disc .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider q = constant throughout the disc . by doing this",
    "we would like to understand what happens to the lopsided perturbations when there is a non - zero q in the disc .",
    "the behaviour of the cold disc against lopsided perturbation changes dramatically as soon as a finite velocity dispersion is introduced in the system .",
    "the transformation in the disc behaviour is best seen through the complete eigen spectrum plotted ( fig.6 ) in the argand diagram for different values of q. in the case of q=0 , there are only a few modes in the continuum with im(@xmath73)=0 and only one or two in the discrete region .",
    "most of the modes in the continuum are of unstable in nature .",
    "however as we increase the q value , the disc changes abruptly and modes in the continuum are populated along the real line i.e. with im(@xmath73)=0 .",
    "for q=0.2 in this case shows that there are almost no unstable modes in the discrete region , some of them are indeed in the continuum with high pattern speeds . at q=0.6",
    ", we see the appearence of unstable modes in the discrete region of the spectrum .",
    "the appearence of the unstable mode in the spectrum is not very obvious .",
    "there are subtle interplay amongst the indirect term in the poisson equation ( eq.[18 ] ) , the softened part of the self - gravity and the velocity dispersion ( q ) . without the indirect term",
    "the ground state modes are never unstable , no matter what the values of the softening ( @xmath60 ) and the q - value in the disc .",
    "the indirect term turns out to be the main driver of the lopsided instability in the disc .    beyond this as q increases , the number of unstable modes goes down and at some q = q@xmath108 no unstable modes are found with lowest pattern speed .",
    "beyond q@xmath108 the modes with lowest value of the pattern speed in hot disc again turn out to be purely oscillatory .",
    "we solve the governing eq.(21 ) for the lopsided modes in a hot disc with non - zero radial ( @xmath52 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath53 ) velocity dispersions .",
    "inclusion of velocity dispersion has an effect opposite to that of the self - gravity in the disc . in a cold disc ,",
    "the imposed lopsided perturbation emerges to be a stationary normal mode oscillation for smaller sized disc or grows as an instability when the collective effect of the softened self - gravity is sufficient as it is in comparatively larger sized discs .",
    "by addition of a finite non - zero velocity dispersion ( quantified here by a constant value of the q - parameter ) in the disc the strong effect of self - gravity is diluted .",
    "as we increase the q - value the growth rate ( @xmath109=im(@xmath73 ) ) decreases and there exists a q@xmath108 beyond which we find that the lowest frequency modes are no longer unstable in the disc , see fig.7 .",
    "note that as we increase the q - value , the growth rate reaches a maximum and starts to decline ; a similar behaviour of the growth rate vs q was observed in the global analysis of @xmath2 mode in a nearly keplerian disc ( adams et al .",
    "1989 ) . in fig.7",
    "we find the value of q@xmath108 to be 1.0 for a disc with r@xmath110=3.5 r@xmath111 , for other values of r@xmath110 we find that q@xmath108 normally lies around the 1 . the value of q@xmath108 may be surprising to the reader ; note that we are considering here a purely stellar disc without any dark matter halo .",
    "take for example the stellar disc of our galaxy with central surface density @xmath83 = 640 m@xmath112pc@xmath113 , r@xmath111=3.2 kpc and the radial velocity dispersion ( @xmath52 ) as according to the lewis - freeman law ( lewis & freeman 1989 ) , the toomre s q parameter is always less than 1 beyond 1 disc scale length .",
    "in fig.9 we study the behavior of the lopsided modes in a hot disc .",
    "these lopsided modes are again the lowest frequency ( i.e. the lowest value of the real part of the complex eigenvalue ) eigenmodes out of the 2n eigenmodes in the n - ring eigen - system . in a cold disc",
    "these lowest frequency eigenmodes are interesting or have observational relevance because they are global in extent ( having zero or one radial node ) . with the introduction of a finite velocity dispersion ,",
    "the behaviour of the eigenmodes also changes drastically . in fig.9",
    "the solid line is the eigen mode in a cold disc i.e. q=0 . as q - value increases in the disc , the self - gravity starts falling down and fails to synchronize the adjacent rings to precess them coherently and produce a global mode .",
    "the eigen modes start acquiring radial nodes .",
    "the number of radial nodes increases as q approaches the value q@xmath108 . at around q@xmath108",
    "the eigen modes have vanishing amplitudes with many radial nodes beyond 1 disc scale length showing that there is no coherent lopsided pattern anymore in the disc beyond q = q@xmath108 . in fig.8",
    "we show the variation of the pattern speed with the q - value .",
    "interestingly the pattern speed does not get affected in appreciable amount with the increase in q. the pattern speeds of the ground state modes are not quite insensitive to the increment in the velocity dispersion .",
    "our numerical calculation show that there is no definite sense of precession of the lopsided pattern in the disc .",
    "8 also brings out clearly another fact that the global lopsided pattern precesses quite slowly even in a hot disc ! even the dynamical friction ( ideta , 2002 ) from an external dark matter halo would take long time to damp out such a pattern in the galactic disc .    .",
    "note that when q=0.0 i.e. for a cold disc , the lopside modes are coherent with zero or one node at most ( fig .",
    "this coherence in the lopsidedness is lost as the disc becomes hotter .",
    "in order to test the predictions of the previous analysis , numerical simulations have been performed .",
    "since different physical mechanisms can occur in the presence of dark matter halo , and the presence of a gaseous component , the present work is restricted to a pure stellar disc .",
    "initially there is no bulge component , although a pseudo - bulge is building along the simulations , through bar instability , which then triggers a box - peanut shaped bulge formation .",
    "these simulations are meant to isolate the dynamical mechanisms occurring in a pure stellar disc , for academic purposes . in a following paper , more realistic galaxies with dark matter haloes , and gaseous components will be considered .",
    "the galaxy is isolated , and represented by only stellar particles . the most efficient n - body algorithm to simulate such",
    "a distribution is a pm ( particle - mesh ) code .",
    "since in particular @xmath2 modes and lopsidedness are of interest , polar grids with higher spatial resolution in the center are not adapted : the high density core of the galaxy is expected to move around , and the variable resolution could produce artefacts . a cartesian grid is therefore selected .",
    "we use here an fft n - body code with the james ( 1977 ) method to avoid the influence of fourier images .",
    "the useful grid is 256@xmath114x128 , corresponding to ( 60 kpc)@xmath114x30 kpc , implying a cell size of 234 pc .",
    "this size is also the softening length of the newtonian gravity .",
    "the total number of particles is between 8 10@xmath115 and 1.6 10@xmath116 , according to the various runs .",
    "the initial radial distribution of particles is not very important , since it is known that a pure disc without any spherical component ( such as bulge or halo ) is unstable with respect to bar formation ; then the bar re - distributes efficiently the particles , to form an exponential disc ( e.g. combes et al 1990 , pfenniger & friedli 1991 ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the initial distribution of stellar particles is taken according to a kuzmin - toomre disc , of surface density : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the characteristic scale - size of the disc , truncated at 25kpc , with a disc mass m@xmath111 .",
    "the initial velocity distribution of the stars in the disc is computed from the stationary jeans equation in cylindrical coordinates , yielding the asymmetric drift @xmath119 , assuming that @xmath120 , as in the epicyclic approximation .",
    "the distribution of density perpendicular to the disc is that of an isothermal thin layer : @xmath121 with a height slightly flaring with radius , as @xmath122 , where @xmath123 .",
    "the z - velocity dispersion is then computed from @xmath124 .",
    "the initial toomre q parameter is slightly varying with radius as : @xmath125 $ ] the time step is 1 myr .",

    "the characteristic frequencies @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are derived from the measured potential , at the final epoch .      the behaviour of run a and run b is quite similar .",
    "run b has twice more particles , and demonstrates how the particle noise may affect the estimation of the @xmath2 amplitudes ( error bars will be given below ) .",
    "our reference run ( a or b ) reveals a bar instability as expected , given that no dark matter halo , nor bulge is present to stabilise the exponential disc . the strength of the bar is estimated by the ratio of the tangential force of the @xmath3 fourier component , normalized to the radial force .",
    "if the potential is decomposed as @xmath130 the bar strength is the maximum over radius of @xmath131 where @xmath132r .",
    "the evolution of @xmath133 for run b is shown in fig [ bar - runb ] , as well as its pattern speed @xmath134 , measured from the monitoring of the phase of the @xmath3 pattern with time .    in the beginning of the evolution",
    ", the @xmath3 strength has a contribution from the spiral structure which develops , and helps to transfer angular momentum in the outer parts .",
    "after a few gyrs , and in the quasi - stationary state , there is only a bar .",
    "the bar instability heats the stellar disc , which in a first phase weakens the @xmath3 pattern that developped its maximum around 1gyr .",
    "then the bar continues to grow slowly until its strength reaches a stationary value , of @xmath135 .",
    "the bar pattern speed increases slowly in this evolution , which is due to the strong concentration of matter driven by the bar .",
    "the face - on morphology of the galaxy is displayed in the contours of fig [ cont - runb ] .",
    "the edge - on projections reveal the build - up of a peanut morphology , which considerably thickens the stellar disc , and forms a pseudo - bulge .",
    "the abrupt fall - off of the @xmath136 strength in the first evolution phases ( after 2 - 3 gyr ) , is due to the violent instability of the beginning , occuring so shortly with respect to the dynamical time , that the family of orbits sustaining the bar have no time to re - arrange , before the radial redistribution of matter .",
    "the mass is re - distributed radially , in consequence of the angular momentum flow towards the outskirts .",
    "the exponential disk length decreases , and the concentration of matter has the consequence that the bar pattern speed increases . then the resonances change radial location , and therefore involve different particles , which means that the bar can now grow again with a different pattern speed , and different sustaining orbits .    to study the simultaneous development of any @xmath2 mode , the analogous @xmath137 term was computed from the fourier analysis of the potential . however , the @xmath2 amplitude is weaker , and the estimator from the potential , which is a more global way to quantify the lopsidedness , dilutes any local maximum , and therefore revealed too noisy . an estimation from the density map in the face - on projection of the galaxy",
    ", was then preferred .",
    "this is an estimator currently chosen by observers ( e.g. zaritsky & rix 1997 , bournaud et al 2005 ) . from the fourier analysis of the surface density in the plane , we define @xmath138 the ratio of the @xmath2 and @xmath139 term . the behaviour of @xmath138 as a function of radius is displayed for all runs in fig [ a1-toutr ] . for run c and d , there is a strong maximum in the center of the disk ( around 5 kpc ) . after a pronounced minimum around 14kpc ,",
    "the amplitude of a1 is rising again in the outer parts .",
    "the projected density maps of the perturbed disks show that this @xmath2 is essentially due to the off - centering of the corresponding parts of the disk .",
    "the central parts are shifted on one side , while the outers parts are shifted on the opposite side .",
    "this explains the minimum in the intermediate radii ( around 14kpc ) .",
    "although there is mainly at the beginning an @xmath2 spiral structure , the dominating feature of the @xmath2 mode is the off - centering .",
    "it can be noted that the estimator gives a coherent value getting out of the noise between 2 and 10kpc .",
    "values at large radii are always noisier , due to the low number of particles , in the outer parts of an exponentially decreasing surface density . in the very center ,",
    "the small area involved also does not include enough particles .",
    "we therefore select for all runs the common radius r= 5kpc to estimate @xmath138 and deduce the time variations .    while run b",
    "is unstable to the @xmath3 mode ( bar and spiral ) , it does not show a strong @xmath2 perturbation , which could be expected , given the high initial velocity dispersion ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "run c on the contrary is violently unstable with respect to @xmath2 , as can be seen in the evolution of pattern strength in fig [ bar - runc ] and in the contour plots of figure [ cont - runc ] .",
    "this is easily explained through the lower initial velocity dispersion @xmath141 .",
    "both runs develop a bar however , and are unstable with respect to the buckling instability , forming the now well - known peanut shape ( e.g. combes et al 1990 , martinez - valpuesta et al 2006 ) .",
    "the peanut formation interferes with the @xmath2 mode to make the z - elevation of particles asymmetric , and produce a marked tilt in the disc plane at the end of the simulations .",
    "this does not occur for run b , where the distribution of particles remain roughly symmetrical with respect to the center of mass . but run c shows very well this phenomenon . in",
    "the buckling some particles are elevated upwards , at some radii , in resonance with the vertical lindblad resonance , which happens to coincide with the in - plane ilr , since @xmath142 , at these radii .",
    "the lopsidedness happens to give more weight to the population of particles that are elevated upward , breaking the symmetry with respect to the plane .",
    "some particles escape at larger radii , and are lost for the equilibrium .",
    "the remaining disc re - settle in a tilted orientation .",
    "bending instabilities in galactic discs are expected when the ratio between @xmath143 and @xmath144 velocity dispersion ( @xmath145 ) is lower than the araki ( 1985 ) s value of 0.3 ( e.g. revaz & pfenniger 2004 ) . in our runs , this ratio is initially about 0.5 in the center , and falls towards 0.1 in the outer disc .",
    "instabilities are therefore expected . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "the @xmath145 ratio increases to be just above 0.3 ( cf figure [ araki ] ) .    in the edge - on views of fig .",
    "[ cont - runc ] , it is easy to see the shape of the tilt ( see the t= 9.6 gyr epoch for instance ) .",
    "the center of the disc until a radius of 11kpc is tilted with a position angle larger than 90@xmath146 , while the outer parts are tilted the opposite way ( with position angle smaller than 90@xmath146 ) .",
    "the disc shows a warp , with a line of nodes following the peak of the @xmath2 perturbation .",
    "the line of nodes is almost straight .",
    "the @xmath138 amplitude is also conspicuous inside and outside a radius of about 14kpc , as is visible in fig .",
    "[ a1-toutr ] .",
    "this is due to the off - centring of the central part which is opposite of that of the outer parts .",
    "the limiting radius corresponds roughly to the resonant radius where @xmath97 = 0 .",
    "run d was carried out with a twice smaller exponential scale - length , in order to explore the varying smoothing length parameter .",
    "the latter is equal to the cell size of 234 pc , so that the ratio of the disc characteristic size to the softening length is reduced by a factor 2 .",
    "the resulting disc shows a larger instability than for the reference run b , as can can be seen in the evolution of pattern strength in fig [ bar - rund ] , and in the contour plots of figure [ cont - rund ] .    at first",
    ", it may appear paradoxical that run d , characterized by a larger softening with respect to the disc scale , is more unstable to the global @xmath2 mode . for usual wkb local waves ,",
    "self - gravity is reduced by the softening , and disc should be more stable .",
    "but for these global modes , involving the whole disc , with a wavelength comparable to the disc size , this is different .",
    "the instabilities are due only to the collective effect of gravity , and the softening mimicks the effect of pressure , which stabilises more local modes .",
    "the disc is then colder , and can sustain global modes .    the time evolution of the @xmath2 mode is compared for all runs in fig [ m1-toutr ] , where is plotted the value of @xmath138 estimated at the radius of 5kpc .",
    "a maximum at a value of @xmath147 is reached around t= 7 gyr for run c , and at about the same time for run d , at @xmath148 . for run",
    "b the value is negligible and tends to be stationary at @xmath149 .",
    "this evolution corresponds to a coherent lopsidedness deformation of the stellar disc .",
    "the deformation appears quasi still in phase , and within the noise it is impossible to distinguish a value for the pattern speed @xmath150 different from zero .",
    "the @xmath2 perturbations found in the present simulations might appear quite large , with respect to what is usually found in galactic simulations .",
    "however , this is due to the fact that in general galaxy models are assumed to be embedded in massive spherical haloes , which stabilise the discs . here",
    "we have purely stellar discs , initially without any central bulge component .",
    "simulations with massive discs have also been run by revaz & pfenniger ( 2004 ) , who also find @xmath2 perturbations quite common .",
    "the numerical simulations of an isolated purely stellar exponential disc reveals some confirmation of the analytical derivations about the global mode . although the @xmath3 perturbation is always very strong , which is a feature not considered in the calculations , it is possible to see the development of an @xmath2 perturbation , which appears to involve the whole disc , with a global characteristic .",
    "the wavelength is long , at least of the same size as the disc .",
    "the instability in the simulations appear for values of the toomre parameter larger than is predicted for the analytical calculations .",
    "but the latter are computed for an infinitely thin disc , and do not take into account all physical parameters , except with approximations .",
    "the `` effective '' q in the analytical model should be larger than computed , to take account of the pressure , the softening , the thickness of the plane , for instance .",
    "merritt & sellwood ( 1994 ) found also that large - scale modes could develop in numerical galaxies , well beyond the predictions of the analytical calculations in a thin sheet .",
    "all runs develop a bar , a strong @xmath3 perturbation , that slowly develops a peanut instability .",
    "the disc is buckling and thickening around the inner lindblad resonances , between 4 and 6 kpc in radius for runs b and c ( 3kpc for run d ) .",
    "the disc thickening is also enhanced by the heating of the disc through the gravitational instabilities , and saturates after 10 gyr , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dz - toutr ] .",
    "the thickening of the plane is not only enhanced by the peanut alone ( as in run b ) , but also by its coupling with the @xmath2 , leading to the plane tilt : the final thickness is higher in run c where both are present ( fig .",
    "[ dz - toutr ] ) .    for a given softening length",
    ", the @xmath2 develops essentially for the initially colder discs , i.e. initial low values of the toomre parameter @xmath151 .",
    "the run b develops mainly a bar , with little asymmetries , practically no @xmath2 , while the initially cold disc of run c develops a pronounced lopsidedness .",
    "this strong instability heats violently the disc , which is much hotter in the center for run c , as shown by the toomre parameter averaged over the radii inside 5 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ qtoom - r5 ] ) .",
    "since the disc is lopsided , the exact calculation of this parameter is not possible , the center of mass of the galaxy being different from the maximum of density , or the minimum of the gravitational potential .",
    "however , averaged over a much larger radius , the heating of the all runs become more similar ( fig .",
    "[ qtoom - r10 ] ) .",
    "the pattern speed of the @xmath2 is very slow , such that it is difficult to measure .",
    "the perturbation is almost still , difficult to estimate as prograde or retrograde , but certainly is partly retrograde at large radii .",
    "this confirms our semi - analytical results about the pattern speed of the lopsided mode .",
    "a more interesting feature is the behaviour with respect to the relative softening length @xmath60 ( ratio of the softening to the exponential disc scale ) .",
    "the instability with respect to the @xmath2 global mode is larger for a larger @xmath60 ( run d ) , than for a smaller @xmath60 ( run b ) , at the same value of @xmath151 .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of global mode due only to collective gravity effects .",
    "this behaviour might appear surprising , as the softening is known to stabilize discs with respect to gravitational instabilities .",
    "however , the softening suppresses essentially the small scale perturbations , the modes with small wavelength ( obeying the wkb approximation ) .",
    "this then leaves a disc more receptive to global modes , and instabilities with wavelength of the order of the disc radius .",
    "more quantitatively , romeo ( 1994 ) has shown that the softening @xmath152 weakens the potential perturbations of radial wavenumber @xmath153 , by a factor @xmath154 .",
    "this efficiently stabilises all small scale instabilities for run d , which is then colder in the first gyr of evolution and more able to develop global modes .",
    "another argument that could explain that large wavelength modes are favored in rund with respect to run b , is the order of magnitude of the self - gravitating critical scale length , @xmath155 ( cf toomre 1981 ) .",
    "since the scale length @xmath118 of the disc in run d is divided by 2 , keeping the total mass the same , the surface density is multiplied by 4 , and @xmath156 is multiplied by 8 .",
    "the critical scale @xmath157 is divided by 2 .",
    "however , all initial discs were truncated at r=25kpc , and the disc extent is larger with respect to the critical scale in run d.    the efficiency of the swing amplification is parametrized by the @xmath158 factor ( toomre 1981 ) where @xmath159 , and @xmath160 is the pitch angle , nearly 90@xmath146 here . for wavelengths of the order of the disc extent ,",
    "this @xmath158 factor is initially larger for run d , as shown in fig [ lamb20 ] , and approaches the optimum value for maximum amplification , which is 2 .    as in the calculations ,",
    "the simulations show that the lopsided perturbation can live several gyrs , and even remain strong over a hubble time .",
    "this can solve the problem of maintenance of this perturbation in some isolated galaxies .",
    "by treating the lopsided distribution in an exponential galactic disc as a global feature , and using the softened self - gravity of the perturbation , we show that the resulting lopsided mode is long lived to several gyr ( essentially increasing the winding up time scale ) , and it also exhibits a radially increasing amplitude as observed . _",
    "the emerging pattern speed of the lopsided mode is extremely slow being a factor of @xmath1 10 smaller than the local free precession rate and with no particularly preferred sense of precession_. the behaviour of the pattern speed is confirmed in the numerical simulation .",
    "our semi - analytical global treatment shows that _ the lopsidedness appears to be a purely oscillatory normal mode outside the continuum _ in smaller sized disc , while it emerges as an instability in comparatively larger sized disc with a very slowly precessing pattern .",
    "the e - folding growth time scale for a typical disc like that of milky way is @xmath161 gyr .",
    "our numerical analysis show that the disc is never unstable to the lopsided modes without the indirect term arising due to the lopsided perturbation itself .",
    "even though there is a subtle interplay between the indirect term due to the lopsided perturbation and the collective effect of the softened self - gravity , it appears that the indirect term plays a crucial role in preparing the disc susceptible to lopsided instability .",
    "numerical simulations of an isolated purely stellar component , an exponential disc without any stellar bulge or dark matter halo , has confirmed the theoretical predictions , and also show long - lived @xmath2 global modes .",
    "the criteria for stability are different than for local wkb modes , and gravity softening stabilises essentially the local modes , but the global ones are not much affected by the softening .",
    "the @xmath2 modes superpose to the bar mode , that appear in all runs studied here .",
