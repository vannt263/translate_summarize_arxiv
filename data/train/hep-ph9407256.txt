    "the study of charmed particles is of interest not only in its own right , but for the information it can provide about particles containing @xmath0 quarks .",
    "charmed particles are relatively easy to produce . in the standard electroweak picture ,",
    "their weak decays are unlikely to exhibit detectable cp - violating effects , and are noticeably affected by strong interactions .",
    "the good news is that these strong interactions are rich and easily studied",
    ".    particles containing @xmath0 quarks are much harder to produce . their weak interactions ( again , in the conventional view )",
    "are expected to be a rich source of observable cp - violating phenomena , and to be less polluted by the strong interactions . however , these strong interactions are still important ( for example , one needs to know @xmath1 meson decay constants ) , but their study is hampered by a lack of statistics . here , charmed particles can be very helpful .",
    "many questions regarding @xmath1 hadrons can benefit from the corresponding studies of charmed particles .",
    "these include resonances , spin - dependent effects , lifetime differences , and form factors for heavy - to - light weak transitions .",
    "moreover , since weak decays of @xmath1 hadrons often involve charm , the branching ratios of charmed particles are crucial in determining the corresponding @xmath1 branching ratios .",
    "this brief article touches upon some of the ways in which information about charmed particles can be applied to the corresponding states containing @xmath0 quarks . in section 2 we review the relevant aspects of heavy quark symmetry permitting an extrapolation from charm to beauty .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the open questions facing the study of cp violation in @xmath1 decays , with emphasis on parallels with charm .",
    "section 4 is devoted to strange @xmath1 s : their production , masses , and mixings , and the corresponding questions for charm .",
    "heavy meson decay constants , for which we have partial information in the case of charm , are treated in section 5 .",
    "heavy baryon spectra are discussed in section 6 , while section 7 treats lifetime differences .",
    "we summarize in section 8 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is measured by a comparison of strange particle decays with muon decay and nuclear beta decay , leading to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is just the cabibbo @xcite angle .",
    "the dominant decays of @xmath0-flavored hadrons occur via the element @xmath27 .",
    "the lifetimes of these hadrons and their semileptonic branching ratios then lead to estimates in the range @xmath28 .",
    "the decays of @xmath0-flavored hadrons to charmless final states allow one to measure the magnitude of the element @xmath21 and thus to conclude that @xmath29 .",
    "the least certain quantity is the phase of @xmath21 : arg @xmath30 .",
    "we shall mention ways in which information on this quantity may be improved , in part by indirect information associated with contributions of higher - order diagrams involving the top quark .",
    "the unitarity of v and the fact that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are very close to 1 allow us to write @xmath33 , or , dividing by a common factor of @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the point @xmath36 thus describes in the complex plane one vertex of a triangle whose other two vertices are @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this triangle and conventional definitions of its angles are depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "indirect information on the ckm matrix comes from @xmath39 mixing and cp - violating @xmath40 mixing , through the contributions of box diagrams involving two charged @xmath41 bosons and two quarks of charge 2/3 @xmath42 on the intermediate lines .",
    "evidence for the top quark with a mass of @xmath43 gev/@xmath44 has recently been reported @xcite , reducing the errors associated with these box diagrams .",
    "the original evidence for @xmath39 mixing came from the presence of `` wrong - sign '' leptons in @xmath1 meson semileptonic decays @xcite .",
    "the splitting @xmath45 between mass eigenstates is proportional to @xmath46 is the @xmath1 meson decay constant .",
    "the contributions of lighter quarks in the box diagrams , while necessary to cut off the high - energy behavior of the loop integrals , are numerically insignificant .",
    "the ckm element @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "thus , exact knowledge of @xmath49 and @xmath50 would specify a circular arc in the @xmath36 plane with center ( 1,0 ) .",
    "errors on all these quantities spread this arc out into a band .",
    "present averages @xcite give @xmath51 .",
    "this value ( close to 1 ) is nearly optimal for observing cp - violating asymmetries in @xmath52 decays .",
    "similar box diagrams govern the parameter @xmath53 in cp - violating @xmath54 mixing . here",
    "the dominant contribution to the imaginary part of the off - diagonal mass matrix element is proportional to @xmath55 i m @xmath56 times a slowly varying function of @xmath50 .",
    "charmed quarks also provide a small contribution .",
    "the kaon decay constant is known : @xmath57 mev .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "knowledge of @xmath53 thus specifies a hyperbola in the @xmath36 plane with focus at @xmath59 , which is spread out into a band because of uncertainties in hadronic matrix elements .",
    "information on @xmath60 specifies a circular band in the @xmath36 plane .",
    "when this constraint is added to those mentioned above , one obtains the potato - shaped region shown in fig .  2 .",
    "here we have taken @xmath61 gev/@xmath44 , @xmath62 mev , @xmath63 ( corresponding to @xmath64 ) , and @xmath65 ( corresponding to @xmath66 ) . a parameter known as @xmath67 describes the degree to which the box diagrams dominate the @xmath68-violating @xmath69 mixing .",
    "we take @xmath70 , and set the corresponding value for @xmath1 mesons equal to 1 .",
    "a qcd correction @xcite to the @xmath71 mixing amplitude has been taken to be @xmath72 .",
    "other parameters and fitting methods are as discussed in more extensive treatments elsewhere @xcite .",
    "several parallel analyses @xcite reach qualitatively similar conclusions .",
    "the best fit corresponds to @xmath73 , while at 90% confidence level the allowed ranges are : @xmath74 @xmath75    a broad range of parameters gives an acceptable description of cp violation in the kaon system .",
    "the study of cp violation in @xmath1 decays could confirm or disprove this picture .",
    "any manifestation of cp violation requires some sort of interference .",
    "we give two of the main examples under consideration for @xmath1 decays .",
    "we then discuss how charmed particles can provide useful information in both cases .",
    "inequality of the rates for a process and its charge conjugate , such as @xmath76 and @xmath77 , would signify cp violation . under charge conjugation ,",
    "the weak phases change sign while the strong phases do not .",
    "a rate difference can arise if both strong and weak phases are different in two channels ( here , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "interpretation requires knowing the strong phase shift difference @xmath80 .",
    "interference between a decay amplitude and a mixing amplitude can lead to rate differences between decays of @xmath52 s and @xmath81 s to cp eigenstates such as @xmath82 or @xmath83 . here , no strong phase shift is needed to generate an observable effect , and decay rate asymmetries can directly probe angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "however , it is necessary to know the flavor of the initial neutral @xmath1 meson .",
    "several examples involving charmed particles can be instructive in how one obtains final - state phase shift information from decay rates .",
    "these examples turn out to have parallels in the case of @xmath1 mesons , but the cases of real interest for cp violation in the @xmath1 system turn out to be somewhat more complex .    the decays @xmath84 are characterized by the quark subprocess @xmath85 , which has @xmath86 , and so there are two final - state amplitudes , one with @xmath78 and one with @xmath79 . the amplitudes for decays to specific charge states can be written in terms of isospin amplitudes as @xmath87 ; @xmath88 ; @xmath89 .",
    "the amplitudes then obey a triangle relation , and by considering the observed rates one finds the relative phase of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 amplitudes to be around 90@xmath90 @xcite .",
    "this is likely to indicate the importance of resonant structure .",
    "the @xmath78 channel is `` non - exotic '' ( it can be formed of a quark - antiquark state ) , while the @xmath91 channel is `` exotic , '' requiring at least two quarks and two antiquarks .",
    "no resonances have been seen in exotic channels , while there is an @xmath92 resonance just around the mass of the @xmath93 meson @xcite .",
    "triangle constructions similar to that mentioned above indicate that the relative phase of @xmath78 and @xmath79 amplitudes in @xmath94 appears to be about 90@xmath90 , while it appears to be about 0 in @xmath95 .",
    "this difference may be due to details of resonance couplings , but could not have been anticipated _ a priori_. it illustrates the importance of actual measurements rather than theoretical prejudices in the evaluation of final - state phase shift differences .",
    "the decays @xmath96 are governed by the subprocess @xmath97 ( or @xmath98 penguin subprocesses ) .",
    "the @xmath99 transitions lead to an @xmath100 final state , while the @xmath101 transitions lead to an @xmath102 final state .",
    "again , a triangle relation holds between amplitudes , and the @xmath103 and @xmath104 amplitudes are found @xcite to have a relative phase consistent with 90@xmath90 .",
    "the decays @xmath105 involve the quark subprocess @xmath106 and so their isospin analysis parallels that of @xmath84 .",
    "it has recently been concluded @xcite that present data are consistent with a relative phase shift of zero between the @xmath78 and @xmath79 amplitudes .",
    "the decays @xmath107 involve the quark subprocesses @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( penguin processes ) , and thus are characterized by both @xmath110 and @xmath111 transitions .",
    "the @xmath110 transitions can lead only to an @xmath78 final state , while the @xmath111 transitions lead to both @xmath78 and @xmath79 final states .",
    "four @xmath107 decay amplitudes then can be expressed in terms of two @xmath78 and one @xmath79 reduced amplitude , leading to a quadrangle relation @xcite .",
    "suggestions have been made @xcite for incorporating information from @xmath112 decays with the help of flavor su(3 ) and untangling various final - state phases in the @xmath113 channel .      as mentioned above",
    ", the decays of neutral @xmath1 mesons to cp eigenstates can provide crisp information on angles in the unitarity triangle if one can `` tag '' the flavor of the decaying @xmath1 at the time of its production .",
    "one method for doing this @xcite relies on the correlation of a neutral @xmath1 with a charged pion .",
    "this method @xcite is already in use for tagging neutral @xmath93 decays .",
    "the charged @xmath114 resonance is far enough above the neutral @xmath93 that the decays @xmath115 and @xmath116 are kinematically allowed . here",
    "one is interested in whether a given final state has arisen from mixing or from the doubly - suppressed process @xmath117 .    in the case of @xmath1 mesons ,",
    "the @xmath118 is only 46 mev above the @xmath1 , so the decay @xmath119 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "nonetheless , one can expect non - trivial correlations between the flavor of a produced @xmath1 and a pion nearby in phase space , either as a result of correlations in the fragmentation process or through the decays of resonances above the @xmath118 . in both cases ,",
    "the corresponding physics for charmed particles is easy to study and will provide interesting information .",
    "the pion-@xmath1 correlation in a fragmentation picture is illustrated in fig .",
    "when incorporated into a neutral @xmath1 meson , a @xmath120 quark is `` dressed '' with a @xmath121 , leading to a @xmath52 .",
    "the next quark down the rapidity chain is a @xmath122 , which will appear in a pion of positive charge .",
    "similarly , a @xmath123 is more likely to be correlated with a @xmath124 .",
    "the existence of this correlation in cdf data is still a matter of some debate",
    ". it would be interesting to see if it exists for charmed particles .",
    "one would have to subtract out the contribution of @xmath114 decays , of course .",
    "a @xmath52 or @xmath126 can resonate with a positive pion , while a @xmath81 or @xmath127 can resonate with a negative pion .",
    "the combinations @xmath128 and @xmath129 are exotic , and not expected to be resonant .",
    "the lowest - lying resonances which can decay to @xmath130 or @xmath131 are expected to be the p - wave @xmath132 states .",
    "we call them @xmath125 ( to distinguish them from the @xmath118 s ) . the expectations for masses of these states @xcite , based on extrapolation from the known @xmath133 resonances ,",
    "are summarized in table 1 .",

    "_ direct measurements _ are available so far only for the @xmath135 decay constant .",
    "the wa75 collaboration @xcite has seen 6  7 @xmath136 events , and fermilab e653 and the bes detector at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) also have a handful .",
    "the cleo collaboration @xcite has a much larger statistical sample ; the main errors arise from background subtraction and overall normalization ( which relies on the @xmath137 branching ratio ) .",
    "the actual measurement is @xmath138 .",

    "one method @xcite is to apply factorization @xcite to the decay @xmath140 , where @xmath137 , to obtain the combination @xmath141 . since @xmath142",
    ", one can extract both the decay constant and the desired branching ratio . using this and other methods , muheim and stone @xcite estimate @xmath143 mev and @xmath144 .",
    "the large value of @xmath145 implies a branching ratio of about 9% for @xmath146 .",
    "this is good news for experiments @xcite contemplating the production of @xmath147 in beam dumps .      by searching for the decay @xmath148 in the decays of @xmath93 mesons produced in the reaction @xmath149 ,",
    "the mark iii collaboration has obtained the upper limit @xcite @xmath150 mev ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "the bes detector at beijing should be able to improve upon this limit , which is not far above theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "the cleo measurement of @xmath145 mentioned above relied on photon-@xmath135 correlations in the decay @xmath151 .",
    "one may be able to search for the decay @xmath152 by looking for the @xmath153 correlation in the decay @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath155 were better known , the indeterminacy in the @xmath36 plane associated with fits to ckm parameters would be reduced considerably .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the variation in @xmath156 for the fit described in sec .  3.1 when @xmath155 is taken to have a fixed value .",
    "an acceptable fit is obtained for a wide range of values , with @xmath157 for @xmath158 and 187 mev .",
    "the reason for the flat behavior of @xmath156 with @xmath155 is illustrated in fig .  5 . the dashed line , labeled by values of @xmath155 , depicts the @xmath36 value for the solution with minimum @xmath156 at each @xmath155 .",
    "the product @xmath159 is constrained to be a constant by @xmath39 mixing .",
    "the product @xmath160 is constrained to be constant by the value of @xmath53 .",
    "the locus of solutions to these two conditions lies approximately tangent to the circular arc associated with the constraint on @xmath60 for a wide range of values of @xmath155 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath155 thus becomes a major source of uncertainty in @xmath161 , which will not improve much with better information on @xmath60 .",
    "fortunately , several estimates of @xmath155 are available , and their reliability should improve .    _",
    "lattice gauge theories _ have attempted to evaluate decay constants for @xmath93 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "a representative set @xcite is @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165 where the first errors are statistical , the second are associated with fitting and lattice constant , and the third arise from scaling from the static @xmath166 limit .",

    "estimates these ratios range between 0.8 and 0.9 .    an improved measurement of @xmath145 and a first measurement of @xmath173 could provide a valuable check on predictions of various theories and could help pin down @xmath1 meson decay constants , since ratios are expected to be more reliably predicted than individual constants @xcite .",
    "the @xmath174 baryon is a particularly simple object in heavy - quark symmetry , since its light - quark system consists of a @xmath175 and @xmath121 quark bound to a state @xmath176 $ ] of zero spin , zero isospin , and color antitriplet .",

    "6 . the lower - lying candidate , 308 mev above the @xmath174 , decays to @xmath185 , while the higher - lying candidate , 342 mev above the @xmath174 , does not appear to decay to @xmath185 , but rather to @xmath186 .",
    "this pattern can be understood @xcite if the lower candidate has @xmath182 and the higher has @xmath187 .",
    "the lower state can decay to @xmath185 via an s - wave , while the higher one would have to decay to @xmath185 via a d - wave .",

    "the difference is easily understood in terms of reduced - mass effects .",
    "the @xmath190 splittings appear to scale with the inverse of the heavy quark ( @xmath191 or @xmath192 ) mass .",
    "the corresponding excited @xmath193 states probably lie 300 to 330 mev above the @xmath194 , with an @xmath190 splitting of about 10 mev .",
    "charmed particle lifetimes range over a factor of ten , with @xmath195    effects which contribute to these differences @xcite include ( a ) an overall nonleptonic enhancement from qcd @xcite , ( b ) interference when at least two quarks in the final state are the same @xcite , ( c ) exchange and annihilation graphs , e.g. in @xmath174 and @xmath196 decays @xcite , and ( d ) final - state interactions @xcite .    in the case of @xmath1 hadrons , theorists estimate that all these effects shrink in importance to less than ten percent @xcite .",
    "however , since the measured semileptonic branching ratio for @xmath1 decays of about 10 or 11% differs from theoretical calculations of 13% by some 20% , one could easily expect such differences among different @xmath0-flavored hadrons .",
    "these could arise , for example , from final - state interaction effects . as mentioned earlier @xcite ,",
    "there are many tests for such effects possible in the study of decays of @xmath1 mesons to pairs of pseudoscalars .",
    "charmed particles are a rich source of information about what to expect in the physics of particles containing @xmath0 quarks , in addition to being interesting in their own right .",
    "some properties of charmed particles are expected to be very close to those of @xmath1 hadrons , such as excitation energies .",
    "others are magnified in the case of charm , being proportional to some inverse power of the heavy quark mass .",
    "charmed particles are easier to produce than @xmath1 hadrons in a hadronic environment ( and in photoproduction ) , and so are a natural area of study for fixed - target experiments such as those being performed and planned at fermilab .",
