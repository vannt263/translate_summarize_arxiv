    "in population genetics , one way to explain disparity is to observe how many genes appear only once in the sample .",
    "a gene carried by a single individual is the result of two possible events : either the gene comes from a mutation that appeared in an external branch of the genealogical tree , either this gene is of the ancestral type and mutations occured in the rest of the sample ( see figure [ fig : graph1 ] ) . we suppose that events of the second type occur in a much less frequent way than events of the first type ( it is indeed the case when the size of the sample goes big ) .",
    "the total number of genes carried by a single individual is then closely related to the so - called total external length , which is the sum of all external branch lengths of the tree .",
    "the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent ( see for instance @xcite ) is a well - known example of exchangeable coalescents with multiple collisions ( see @xcite for a proper definition of this type of coalescents ) .",
    "it was first introduced in physics , in order to study spin glasses but it has also been thought as a limiting genealogical model for evolving populations with selective killing at each generation , see for instance @xcite .",
    "recently , berestycki et al . in @xcite noted that this coalescent represents the genealogies of the branching brownian motion with absorption .",
    "the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent @xmath1 , is a continuous time markov chain with values in the set of partitions of @xmath2 , starting with an infinite number of blocks / individuals . in order to give a formal description of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent , it is sufficient to give its jump rates .",
    "let @xmath3 , then the restriction @xmath4 of @xmath1 to @xmath5=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] is a markov chain with values in @xmath6 , the set of partitions of @xmath5 $ ] , with the following dynamics : whenever @xmath7 is a partition consisting of @xmath8 blocks , any particular @xmath9 of them merge into one block at rate @xmath10 so the next coalescence event occurs at rate @xmath11 note that mergers of several blocks into a single block is possible , but multiple mergers do not occur simultaneously .",
    "moreover , this coalescent process is exchangeable , i.e. its law does not change under the effect of a random permutation of labels of its blocks .",
    "one of our aims is to study the total external length of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent .",
    "more precisely , we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the total external length @xmath12 of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent restricted to @xmath6 , when @xmath13 goes to infinity , and relate it to its total length @xmath14 ( the sum of lengths of all external and internal branches ) . a first orientation can be gained from coalescents without proper frequencies .",
    "for this class mhle @xcite proved that after a suitable scaling the asymptotic distributions of @xmath12 and @xmath14 are equal .",
    "now the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent does not belong to this class , but it is ( loosely speaking ) located at the borderline . also it is known for the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent @xcite that @xmath15{d}z,\\ ] ] where @xmath16{d}$ ] denotes convergence in distribution and @xmath17 is a strictly stable r.v . with index 1 , i.e. its characteristic exponent satisfies @xmath18=\\frac{\\pi}{2}|\\theta|-i\\theta\\log|\\theta| , \\qquad \\theta \\in \\mathbb{r}.\\ ] ] in their recent work , dhersin and mhle @xcite showed that the ratio @xmath19 converges to 1 in probability .",
