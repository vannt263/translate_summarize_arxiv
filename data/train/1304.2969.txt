    "the values of @xmath46 , @xmath157 , freeze - out volume , decoupling time for hadrons , @xmath158 and @xmath82 are larger at lhc energies compared to those at rhic .",
    "this is even though the freeze - out temperatures are comparable .",
    "the value of net - charge fluctuation measure is observed to rapidly approach towards a simple model based calculation for qgp state .",
    "however , the sensitivity of this observable for a heavy - ion system as well as lack of proper modeling of the heavy - ion system theoretically for such an observable needs careful consideration .",
    "the @xmath25 fluctuations as a function of centrality fraction have a similar value at both rhic and lhc .",
    "this reflects their sensitivity to initial state effects .",
    "just like at rhic the @xmath159 and direct photon @xmath35 measurements experimentally demonstrated that the observed @xmath35 @xmath18 1 for charged hadrons is a final state effect , so also at lhc the @xmath160 , direct photon , @xmath136 and @xmath161 @xmath35 measurements showed that the observed @xmath35 @xmath18 1 is indeed due to formation of a dense medium of colored charges in central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "all these conclusions were further validated by the comparison of several observables to corresponding model calculations .",
    "further it was found that the fluid at lhc shows a comparable degree of fluidity as that at rhic .",
    "this is reflected by a small value of shear viscosity to entropy density ratio .",
    "measurements related heavy quark production  @xcite , dilepton production , jet - hadron correlations  @xcite and higher order azimuthal anisotropy  @xcite which are now coming out of both rhic and lhc experiments will provide a much more detail characterization of the properties of the qcd matter formed in heavy - ion collisions .",
