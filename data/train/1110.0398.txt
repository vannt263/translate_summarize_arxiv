    "considerable attention has been devoted recently to the study of radiation pressure driven instabilities in magnetized media , which have generally come to be known as photon bubble instabilities .",
    "this name is particularly appropriate to the buoyant long wavelength instabilities studied by @xcite in the context of accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "@xcite found that an analogous instability is likely to exist in radiation - dominated accretion disks .",
    "@xcite extended gammie s analysis to finite gas sound speeds and short wavelengths to show that the instability in this regime is a radiative amplification of magnetosonic modes . at least in media where thomson scattering is the dominant opacity",
    ", the slow mode always has the fastest growth rate .",
    "@xcite derived a fully nonlinear periodic shock train solution to the equations of radiation mhd , which he suggested would be the nonlinear outcome of the short wavelength photon bubble instability .",
    "this was later confirmed by numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "@xcite has also discovered a nonlinear wave solution in the long wavelength , buoyancy regime of the photon bubble instability .",
    "applications of the short wavelength photon bubble instability to accretion disks have been explored extensively by @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most significant implication is that the instability might permit highly super - eddington luminosities from accretion disks that would still be geometrically thin in terms of their vertical mass distribution .",
    "the physics of the short wavelength photon bubble instability has also been extended to situations where other forms of diffusive energy transport exist .",
    "in particular , work has been done on `` neutrino bubble instabilities '' in proto - neutron stars @xcite and `` coulomb bubble instabilities '' in systems with anisotropic thermal conduction due to the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "all of this work on photon bubble and related instabilities has assumed a uniform background magnetic field , but gradients in the magnetic field can also drive instabilities . in particular",
    ", a medium may be vulnerable to magnetic interchange and undulatory parker instabilities @xcite if magnetic pressure gradients contribute significant support against gravity .",
    "vertically stratified shearing box simulations indicate that such instabilities , not photon bubbles , appear to dominate the large scale dynamics of the surface layers of accretion disks @xcite , though it is conceivable that photon bubbles would be relevant on smaller length scales that are unresolved in the existing simulations .    if both the equilibrium density and magnetic pressure decrease outward , then both the parker and photon bubble unstable modes reduce to slow magnetosonic modes in the short wavelength limit .",
    "it is therefore likely that these two instabilities have nontrivial couplings in equilibria with both magnetic and radiation pressure gradients , and it is important to study this coupling in order to understand under what regimes and length scales each instability is likely to operate .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper : we investigate local radiation mhd instabilities in equilibria that are supported against gravity by both radiation and magnetic pressure gradients .",
    "we begin in section 2 by stating the basic radiation mhd equations and assumptions that we employ in our analysis .",
    "the perturbation equations are very complicated to analyze when we include both radiation and magnetic field physics , and much of the rest of the paper is devoted to various levels of approximation .",
    "the situation is simplest when one neglects gas pressure completely , as in gammie s ( 1998 ) original analysis of the photon bubble instability .",
    "we employ that approach in section 3 , and find a single unstable mode at all wavelengths .",
    "there is a characteristic transition wavelength @xmath0 above which the mode is parker - like and below which the mode becomes the standard photon bubble instability , although the actual transition wavelength depends on the orientation of the wave vector of the perturbations . in section 4 , we discuss the effects of finite gas pressure . because much of the recent interest in photon bubble instabilities lies in accretion disks , we include the effects of differential rotation in section 5 and then discuss applications of our results to accretion disks in section 6 .",
    "we finish by summarizing our findings in section 7 . in the appendices we briefly",
    "show that our perturbation equations recover the basic properties of magnetic buoyancy instabilities derived by previous authors and show that , in contrast to the case of adiabatic perturbations @xcite , the most rapidly growing parker modes do not require large horizontal shear between field lines when radiation diffusion is rapid .",
    "we also present a more detailed derivation of our instability analysis with differential rotation .",
    "@xcite derived simplified versions of the general radiation mhd equations of @xcite , and we continue to use the same equations here , but with some additional assumptions .",
    "we assume that the gas and radiation temperatures are locked together and that the flux mean opacity @xmath1 is a constant ( as would be true for thomson scattering ) .",

    "the perturbation equations presented above are complicated and can not be readily combined into a single ordinary differential equation . to make progress , we first consider short wavelengths where radiative diffusion is rapid , and follow @xcite by adopting the limit of zero gas pressure . after all , we are particularly interested in environments where magnetic and radiation pressures dominate greatly over gas pressure .",
    "the mathematical advantage of this approximation is that there is then no slow magnetosonic wave limit and the photon bubble instability appears at lowest order in the short wavelength limit .",
    "( for nonzero gas pressure , this analysis would only be valid for photon bubble wavelengths longer than a finite turnover wavelength ; see section  [ sec : finitegas ] below . ) at the same time , the minimum unstable wavelength for the parker instability also vanishes in the rapid diffusion limit if the gas pressure is zero . hence the zero gas pressure limit enables us to explore the coupled photon bubble and parker problem in the short wavelength wkb limit at lowest order .",
    "we shall find that the shortest wavelengths are always in the photon bubble regime , but if magnetic support dominates radiation support in the equilibrium , then there is a wkb transition wavelength longward of which the parker instability becomes manifest .",

    "on the other hand , if magnetic pressure gradients dominate radiation pressure gradients in supporting the medium against gravity , the last term in equation ( [ eqdisp1 ] ) can be small except at extremely short wavelengths . neglecting this term , and also the linear term in @xmath61 for the moment",
    ", the dispersion relation gives for large magnetic pressure gradients @xmath66 which is the short wavelength parker instability growth rate in this regime .",

    "their result assumed an isothermal medium , implying @xmath69 .",
    "however , we show in appendix  [ parkerappendix ] that it is also valid for more general equilibria in which radiation and magnetic pressures dominate gas pressure , and radiative diffusion is rapid .",
    "[ see equation ( [ eqgilmancizero ] ) . ]",
    "note that the pure parker instability is a genuine exponentially growing instability in all space , whereas the pure photon bubble instability is an overstability of traveling waves .",
    "nevertheless , the different wavenumber dependencies of equations ( [ eqomegapbi ] ) and ( [ eqomegaparker ] ) indicate that a transition between photon bubble and parker behavior will occur at a characteristic vertical wavenumber @xmath70 given by @xmath71 provided at least that @xmath72 is not too large compared to @xmath73 .",

    "the parker growth rate is relatively unaffected by @xmath72 in this zero gas pressure regime .    the corresponding transition wavelength can also be written in a more physically transparent fashion as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the radiation pressure and @xmath77 is the magnetic pressure .",
    "as magnetic pressure gradient forces become stronger compared to radiation pressure forces , @xmath0 decreases , extending the long - wavelength range of the parker instability at the expense of the short - wavelength range of the photon bubble instability .    for wkb to make sense with @xmath78 , we require @xmath79",
    "this implies that magnetic support must dominate radiation pressure support in the equilibrium .",

    "the other root is always damped .",
    "the unstable mode again transitions smoothly from parker for @xmath91 to photon bubble for @xmath92 .",
    "the instability always becomes parker - like for wave vectors in the @xmath93 plane , i.e. @xmath94 .",
    "damping affects the parker regime most . for @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 unless @xmath94 , the growth rate of the unstable root is greatly reduced when damping is large ( @xmath97 ) : @xmath98 . on the other hand ,",
    "photon bubbles are relatively unaffected by damping provided @xmath99 .",
    "if instead @xmath100 , then the real and imaginary parts of the unstable photon bubble frequency are markedly reduced : @xmath101    figure [ fig : gammasimp ] illustrates these behaviors .",
    "the black curves show cases with @xmath102 and zero damping ( @xmath103 , solid curve ) and finite damping ( @xmath104 , dashed ) . here",
    "the mode transitions from constant ( parker ) growth rate at low wavenumbers to a ( photon bubble ) growth rate that increases as @xmath62 for high wavenumbers .",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath105 with zero damping , and for @xmath74 somewhere between 10 and 100  @xmath70 for @xmath104 .",
    "the latter is consistent with the transition wavenumber being given by @xmath106 , implying @xmath107 . for this wavenumber orientation , damping affects the parker instability severely .",
    "the photon bubble growth rate is much less affected , however : little damping occurs for @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "the red pair of curves have the same damping parameters but now have wavenumbers oriented mostly in the @xmath93 plane .",
    "the transition to photon bubble behavior now occurs above a much higher wavenumber @xmath110 .",
    "the parker instability is insensitive to damping for this wavenumber orientation .",
    "we now consider the effects of nonzero gas pressure on the coupled photon bubble / parker instability . finite gas pressure stabilizes the parker instability at infinitely short wavelengths .",
    "then radiative diffusion is so fast that @xmath111 , and instability only occurs for wavenumbers satisfying @xmath112 where @xmath113 [ see equation ( [ eqkp2gilman ] ) in the appendix . ]",
    "if the magnetic pressure gradient is the dominant force in supporting the medium against gravity , then @xmath114 reduces to @xmath115 . in this case equation ( [ parker ] ) can be written as @xmath116 ( ignoring wavenumber factors ) , which reveals its physical origin .",
    "buoyancy is fundamentally what drives the parker instability .",
    "stability therefore requires that the magnetic tension not have time to restore the perturbed fluid elements on a buoyant rise time in the gas in the ambient gravitational field ( which is largely determined by magnetic pressure gradients ) .",
    "note , however , that the growth rate of the fastest mode of the instability is @xmath117 , and occurs at a wavenumber much smaller than the marginally stable wavenumber @xmath114 [ equation ( [ eqk0cizero ] ) in the appendix ] .    in a medium that is only supported against gravity by gas and radiation pressure ( no magnetic field gradients ) , finite sound speed affects the photon bubble instability by causing the growth rate to reach a fixed value once the wavenumber is high enough for the mode to become a slow magnetosonic mode .",
    "provided that gas and radiation temperatures are thermally locked ( as we are assuming throughout this paper ) , this turnover wavenumber is given by @xmath118 for wavenumbers greater than @xmath119 , the instability growth rate asymptotes to a constant value @xmath120 when the magnetic pressure is much larger than the gas pressure @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the short wavelength photon bubble instability assumed a uniform equilibrium magnetic field , which therefore provides no support against gravity @xcite . in this case , the turnover wavenumber @xmath119 is approximately @xmath121 , i.e. the reciprocal of the gas pressure scale height @xcite .",
    "when magnetic pressure gradients support the equilibrium , @xmath121 can be significantly larger than the true turnover wavenumber , implying that the asymptotic short wavelengths of the photon bubble instability ( which have the highest growth rates ) can be more easily resolved in numerical simulations than one might have expected from just the gas pressure scale height .",
    "on the other hand , the asymptotic growth rate can also be significantly smaller than the radiation pressure supported equilibrium estimate @xmath122 when magnetic gradients support the equilibrium .",
    "we can write the three wavenumber scales in the problem as @xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125\\right\\}^{1/2 } , \\label{kp}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the radiation pressure scale height , @xmath119 and @xmath114 are the photon bubble turnover and parker cutoff wavenumbers , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that these expressions are only valid in the limit of rapid radiative diffusion .",
    "to study our problem around these wavenumber regimes with wkb methods , we need @xmath127 , where @xmath74 is any of @xmath70 , @xmath119 or @xmath114 and @xmath128 is any of the scale heights .    as we showed in section  [ sectionpzero ] , our @xmath67 wkb dispersion relation ( [ eqdispparkerpbi ] ) agrees with previously published photon bubble and parker instability growth rates .",
    "this suggests that taking the @xmath4-dependence of all perturbations to be @xmath129 without combining the perturbation equations first may prove useful even in the finite but small ( compared to magnetic and radiation pressures ) gas pressure regime .",
    "we solved the resulting dispersion relation numerically .",
    "figure [ fig : finitegas ] shows results for an illustrative set of parameters .",
    "the photon bubble growth rate asymptotes to a finite value beyond the turnover wavenumber @xmath119 because the gas pressure is no longer exactly zero .    in both figures [ fig : gammasimp ] and [ fig : finitegas ] ,",
    "note that there is no sign of photon bubbles for low wavenumber ( @xmath130 ) where diffusion will eventually be slow .",
    "in particular , our low wavenumber growth rate agrees with that of the parker instability , but not with the @xcite photon bubble result . thus if magnetic gradients are large enough that @xmath70 corresponds to wavelengths in the rapid diffusion regime , then the slow diffusion version of the photon bubble instability may not exist .",
    "however , a non - wkb analysis is necessary to verify this conclusively .    it is also possible in principle for the maximum parker growth rate to be higher than that of the photon bubble instability",
    "analytically , this occurs when the photon bubble growth rate obtained by @xcite ( their equation 93 ) exceeds the parker growth rate stated in equation ( [ eqgammamaxgilman ] ) . in the limit",
    "that the medium is magnetically supported , and the gas pressure is much smaller than radiation and magnetic pressures , this comparison means that parker dominates if @xmath131 .",
    "provided the scale heights are comparable , this is equivalent to the condition that @xmath132 , so that the parker growth rate cuts off and decreases down to the asymptotic photon bubble growth rate . in this case",
    "the parker instability transitions into the photon bubble instability when @xmath74 exceeds @xmath114 , which is _ less _ than the transition wavenumber @xmath70 for zero gas pressure .",
    "for finite gas pressure , the parker growth rate can exceed the photon bubble growth rate even without this ordering of the characteristic wavenumbers .",
    "we will later present a finite gas pressure example of this from a numerical simulation of accretion disk vertical structure in section  [ sec : accretiondisks ] below .",
    "motivated by the fact that both parker and photon bubble instabilities are driven by vertical gradients , and by possible applications to stellar envelopes and atmospheres , our analysis so far has assumed a static equilibrium .",
    "however , there has been considerable recent interest in photon bubble physics in radiation dominated accretion disks .",
    "such flows are differentially rotating , and before one can apply our results to such flows , one has to account for the effects of rotation and shear .",
    "such effects were first examined by @xcite for the parker instability , and by @xcite in the case of the photon bubble instability restricted to axisymmetric perturbations .    in the spirit of the short wavelength wkb approximation that we have been using , we restrict attention to a local , corotating patch of a differentially rotating disk and use the fluid equations describing a shearing box @xcite with coordinate axes @xmath133 aligned with the radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions , respectively . appendix [ secrotationderivation ]",
    "presents a detailed analysis of the coupled parker - photon bubble problem , again assuming negligible gas pressure as we did in section  [ sectionpzero ] above .",
    "provided @xmath134 , the azimuthal component @xmath135 of the small amplitude lagrangian displacement of perturbations satisfies the differential equation @xmath136 in the absence of differential rotation , all the coefficients of this equation would be independent of time .",
    "we could then assume a complex exponential time - dependence @xmath137 and recover the static equilibrium dispersion relation ( [ eqdispparkerpbi ] ) that we derived above . as we discuss in more detail in appendix  [ secrotationderivation ] , coriolis forces are negligible provided the wkb approximation is valid",
    ".    however , the shear due to the differential rotation of the equilibrium flow has a more important effect .",
    "this shear means that the radial wavenumber @xmath72 depends on time : @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the initial value of @xmath72 , @xmath140 is the shear parameter ( 3/2 for a keplerian accretion disk ) , and @xmath141 is the angular velocity of the local patch of disk .",
    "the exponential growth rates of the static equilibrium analysis will therefore only be valid so long as these growth rates are faster than the time it takes the radial wavenumber to change significantly in time .",
    "for a magnetically supported medium , this implies that @xmath142 for the parker regime , and @xmath143 for the photon bubble regime .",
    "the latter is easier to satisfy than the former , as the transition from parker to photon bubble occurs when @xmath144 , assuming negligible damping . on the other hand ,",
    "if radiation pressure supports the equilibrium , then shear will not affect the exponential growth of photon bubbles provided @xmath145 , which is essentially equivalent to the wkb condition .",
    "short wavelength photon bubbles are therefore generally less affected by shear than parker modes .",
    "note that if these conditions are not satisfied and/or the instabilities fail to reach the nonlinear regime before the waves start to shear , then the character of the unstable driving can change with time .",
    "for example , a strongly leading nonaxisymmetric perturbation ( e.g. @xmath146 and @xmath139 large and negative ) could start in the parker regime , then flip to the photon bubble regime as the wave swings from leading to trailing ( @xmath147 ) , and then flip back to the parker regime as the perturbation becomes strongly trailing ( @xmath72 large and positive ) .",
    "we illustrate this linear regime behavior in figure  [ fig : shearbox ] which depicts a numerical solution to equation  ( [ eqxidiffeq ] ) .",
    "nonaxisymmetric photon bubbles inevitably enter the parker regime unless they become nonlinear first as the wavevector shears to be strongly trailing .",
    "but again , photon bubbles whose vertical wavelengths are short enough should be able to grow much faster than the shear rate .",
    "axisymmetric ( @xmath148 ) perturbations are immune to these shear effects , but the photon bubble growth rate vanishes for such perturbations .",
    "photon bubbles necessarily require wave vectors which are neither entirely perpendicular or along the equilibrium magnetic field @xcite .",
    "because we are considering equilibria with vertical magnetic gradients , we restricted consideration to equilibrium magnetic fields that are entirely in the azimuthal ( @xmath149 ) direction .",
    "these are generally the dominant magnetic field components even in a turbulent accretion disk because of the differential rotation . but other components are present , especially in the surface layers if large - scale parker modes are able to grow @xcite .",
    "axisymmetric photon bubbles on an equilibrium with magnetic field components in all directions have growth rates that are proportional to the square of the ratio of the non - azimuthal field components to the total magnetic field @xcite , and hence have slower growth rates than nonaxisymmetric photon bubbles in a medium dominated by azimuthal fields .",
    "our discussion in this section has assumed negligible sound speed @xmath150 in the gas alone . as we will see in the next section ,",
    "radiation mhd simulations of local patches of accretion disks generally produce conditions in which @xmath151 .",
    "hence the main thing that finite gas sound speed introduces is a limit @xmath152 to the short wavelength photon bubble growth rate for @xmath153 . in that very short wavelength regime ,",
    "photon bubbles continue to be immune to the shear rate . for a radiation pressure supported medium",
    ", this merely requires @xmath154 , which is clearly satisfied because @xmath155 . for a magnetically supported medium ,",
    "this requires instead that @xmath156 provided the radiation pressure and magnetic pressure scale heights are comparable .",
    "this in turn is equivalent to the condition that @xmath157 , which we find to be generally true .",
    "to summarize , in a medium supported by radiation pressure , rotation and shear do not significantly affect the photon bubble regime provided we are considering vertical wavelengths that are short enough for the wkb approximation to be valid ( @xmath158 ) . in a magnetically supported medium ,",
    "photon bubbles grow quickly compared to the shear rate provided the vertical wavelength is much shorter than the transition wavelength @xmath0 .",
    "shear is more important near or longer than the transition wavelength ; i.e. in the parker regime , modes can be more affected by shear , unless they are associated with very short radial wavelengths .",
    "in this section we investigate the relevance of photon bubble and parker instabilities to the surface layers of high luminosity accretion disks , using recent stratified shearing box , radiation - mhd simulations as a guide to expected local conditions .",
    "in particular , we use data from simulations 0528a of @xcite and @xcite , and 1112a and 0519b of @xcite .",
    "the simulations represent local patches of accretion disks at 30 ( 1112a and 0519b ) and 150 ( 0528a ) gravitational radii around a 6.62 solar mass black hole , and have time - averaged , volume - integrated radiation to gas pressure ratios of approximately 1 ( 0528a ) , 7 ( 1112a ) , and 70 ( 0519b ) .",
    "we time and horizontally average the fluid variables in each simulation in order to have an approximate vertically stratified equilibrium in which to explore the instabilities that we have calculated above .",
    "all time averages of the simulation data neglect the first ten orbits during which the magnetorotational instability was still developing .",
    "figure  [ fig : pressures ] depicts the time and horizontally - averaged vertical profiles of radiation , gas and magnetic pressures in each of the three simulations .",
    "( the height @xmath4 on the horizontal axis in these and other figures in this paper is in units of the scale height @xmath128 of the initial condition of the simulations : approximately @xmath159  cm for 0528a , @xmath160  cm for 1112a and @xmath161  cm for 0519b .",
    "this initial scale height is comparable to the actual total pressure scale height of the resulting time - averaged structure . ) in the outer layers of the accretion disk in all three simulations , magnetic pressure greatly dominates gas pressure , and also generally dominates radiation pressure . as a result , the parker instability generally controls the dynamics of these layers on the scales resolved by the simulations @xcite .",
    "however , figure [ fig : pressures ] shows that at the highest levels of radiation to gas pressure ratio , radiation pressure is becoming comparable to magnetic pressure in supporting the disk outer layers .",
    "we therefore expect the photon bubble instability to be more prominent in higher radiation pressure systems as the transition wavenumber @xmath70 decreases with decreasing magnetic to radiation pressure ratio , assuming comparable radiation and magnetic pressure scale heights .",
    "photon bubbles , rather than parker instability , may control the surface layer dynamics at high levels of radiation pressure support .            beyond pressure considerations",
    ", the medium also needs to be optically thick ( but not so thick as to impede radiative diffusion ) at a particular wavelength in order to drive the photon bubble instability at that wavelength .",
    "this is because diffusive radiative transport is essential for producing radiative amplification when the opacity is dominated by thomson scattering @xcite .",
    "however , figure [ fig : tau ] shows that the photon bubble turnover wavelength becomes optically thin to electron scattering beyond @xmath162 of approximately 2.1 and 2.7 for simulations 0519b and 1112a , respectively .",
    "this means that the instability can not exist at wavenumbers higher than @xmath119 and thus will not achieve its maximum growth rate near the disk photosphere .",
    "these simple estimates mean that only longer wavelength photon bubble modes can grow in the upper layers of such accretion disks .",
    "nevertheless , these slower , longer wavelength modes might still develop into shock trains : approximate nonlinear solutions with finite optical depths have been explored by @xcite . the parker instability , on the other hand , is not driven by radiative diffusion and hence is not subject to such optical depth restrictions .",
    "incidentally , figure  [ fig : tau ] also shows that @xmath151 in all three simulations . with the exception of 0528a ( see figure [ fig:0528ak ] ) where the gas pressure in the disk upper layer is not negligibly small , the growth rate dependence on wavenumber therefore resembles that depicted in figure  [ fig : finitegas ] . as shown in that figure , the parker instability transitions into the photon bubble instability at short wavelengths before magnetic tension would introduce a cutoff .",

    "we therefore see that parker instabilities with small @xmath72 can not exist in the rapid diffusion regime in the highest radiation to gas pressure ratio simulation 0519b , as they have already transitioned into photon bubbles .",
    "this reflects the fact that we noted above that magnetic pressure is not dominant over radiation pressure in the surface layers of this simulation . however , large @xmath72 modes ( i.e. those with large radial shear between the field lines ) will still be parker - like in character even in the rapid radiative diffusion regime , and the magnetic field and density structure in this simulation still shows evidence of parker instability @xcite .",

    "the photon bubbles may evolve into nonlinear shock trains @xcite that can propagate outward into the photosphere and potentially produce observable signatures .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : lcrit ] shows that the turnover wavelength in 1112a and 0519b is at most a few times larger than the grid zone size in the region where @xmath119 is in the rapid diffusion limit , which means that the simulation can not resolve the fastest growing photon bubble modes , even if they can physically exist in this region .",

    ", we only show the parker growth rates where the cutoff wavelength @xmath164 is in the rapid diffusion regime , where the analysis of this paper is valid .",
    "photon bubbles grow faster than parker in this range of heights , and so in principle could be important , but as we noted above , the simulations can not resolve these fastest growing wavelengths .",

    "figure  [ fig:0528agrowth ] shows the same information for simulation 0528a , and may explain why @xcite did not observe the photon bubble instability in this @xmath176 simulation .",
    "there the transition wavelength in the upper layers is moderately optically thick to electron scattering , which suggests that photon bubbles can physically exist in the simulated disk .",
    "however , figure  [ fig:0528agrowth ] shows that parker is the dominant instability , at least for @xmath177 , where @xmath164 is in the rapid diffusion regime .",
    "figure [ fig:0528ak ] shows the growth rate as a function of wavenumber at a representative height ( @xmath178 ) in the disk upper layer and further illustrates this conclusion .",
    "closer to the midplane , radiative damping dominates over photon bubbles in the short wavelength limit .",
    "note that our plotted results are comparable to and consistent with the growth rates estimated by @xcite at two specific epochs in this simulation .",
    "those authors did not know how parker and photon bubbles couple together , but we have demonstrated here that the maximum growth rates of the individual instabilities are in fact unaltered .",
    "we expanded previous studies of photon bubble instabilities to include background magnetic field gradients , thereby introducing a coupling between photon bubble and parker instabilities .",
    "our first main result was obtained assuming negligible gas pressure in the equilibrium , which in principle allows the photon bubble and parker instabilities to exist out to very short wavelengths .",
    "there we identified a finite transition wavenumber @xmath70 between the photon bubble and parker instabilities .",
    "the instability is parker - like for @xmath78 and photon bubble - like for @xmath179 , although strong horizontal shear between neighboring magnetic field lines ( i.e. large @xmath72 ) pushes the parker - like range to higher wavenumber .",
    "we then proceeded to a naive wkb study including finite gas pressure .",
    "we numerically found approximately the same transition wavenumber .",
    "moreover , finite gas pressure introduces finite photon bubble turnover and parker cutoff wavenumbers ( @xmath119 and @xmath114 , respectively ) . for @xmath132 , we see a sharp growth rate decrease above @xmath180 , while the photon bubble growth rate becomes constant in @xmath74 for @xmath181 . once again , the growth rates of both instabilities agree with previous results in all wavenumber regimes .",
    "we also derived the scaling of the important wavenumbers @xmath119 , @xmath114 and @xmath70 as functions of background parameters in equations ( [ ktran])-([kp ] ) .",
    "note that the results of this paper can only be applied to backgrounds where the characteristic wavenumbers @xmath70 , @xmath114 and @xmath119 satisfy the wkb condition @xmath182 .",
    "we also developed a wkb analysis of the coupled parker / photon bubble problem including the effects of differential rotation .",
    "photon bubbles are not significantly affected by shear and rotation provided their wavelengths are short enough . on the other hand ,",
    "parker modes can be affected by shear unless they have short radial wavelengths .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition of strong horizontal shear between neighboring field lines that expands the parker - like range to higher wavenumber .",
    "we applied our results to analyze radiation mhd shearing box accretion disk simulations 0528a , 1112a and 0519b with volume integrated radiation to gas pressure ratios of 1 , 7 and 70 , respectively .",
    "we found that the asymptotically growing short wavelength photon bubble instability is not likely to exist in the upper layers of both 1112a and 0519b because the turnover wavelength becomes optically thin to electron scattering in the photosphere .",
    "for 0528a , the undulatory parker instability in the rapid diffusion regime dominates over photon bubbles in the upper layers . on the other hand ,",
    "radiative damping destroys the photon bubbles near the midplane in all three simulations , and photon bubbles may exist at the asymptotic growth rate only in a narrow range of heights .",
    "even there it is not clear whether the turbulent conditions would allow the photon bubbles to grow unimpeded .",
    "last but not least , the grid cell sizes of current radiation pressure dominated simulations are inadequate to fully resolve the turnover wavelength of the photon bubble instability , so that the fastest growing wavelengths can not manifest themselves .",
    "higher resolution radiation pressure dominated simulations may reveal this instability .",
    "while accretion disk applications have been our focus , much of the analysis of this paper applies to static media , and magnetized stellar envelopes are clearly another area where this physics would be relevant .",
    "generalizing the simulations by @xcite of magnetized , vertically stratified static equilibria to include magnetic pressure gradients would be interesting in order to explore how the photon bubble and parker instabilities interact in the nonlinear regime .",
    "even if short wavelength photon bubbles have faster linear growth rates than the longer wavelength parker modes , @xcite have shown that the resulting nonlinear shock trains merge , causing the distances between adjacent shocks and the density contrast to grow until the magnetic field buckles ( or until only one wavelength fills the simulation domain ) .",
    "this field line buckling may resemble the nonlinear development of the undulatory parker instability , and it may be that both instabilities ultimately lead to a similar nonlinear outcome , at least in some regimes .    finally , we stress an important caveat to our work : the photon bubble - parker transition regime of our numerical finite gas pressure results do not readily apply when @xmath183 , @xmath184 or @xmath185 , due to limitations of the wkb method discussed in section 4 .",
    "such regimes can exist in the portion of the accretion disk within and just outside the mri unstable region , where the gravitational potential energy is dissipated into heat @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the parker - photon bubble transition in this region may be important for understanding how accretion power is transported outward .",
    "this is a difficult problem that may deserve further future work .",
    "we owe a debt of gratitude to ellen zweibel for illuminating many aspects of the physics of the parker instability .",
    "we also thank the referee for constructive criticism and for suggesting that we look more carefully at the issues of rotation and shear when considering accretion disk applications .",
    "we have benefited from helpful discussions with l. bildsten , m. block , k. choiu , e. gallo , j. jacob , e. rykoff , n. turner , e. newton and d. harsono .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grants ast-0307657 and ast-0707624 .",
    "in order to better understand the coupled photon bubble - parker problem , it is useful to derive the properties of pure parker modes in the absence of photon bubble instabilities .",
    "we are most interested in a medium where radiation pressure dominates gas pressure , and in short wavelengths where radiative diffusion is rapid .",
    "the latter condition implies that temperature perturbations are very small , and if we take them literally to be zero , then the flux perturbations that drive photon bubble instabilities in this regime will vanish identically , leaving only pure parker modes .",
    "parker modes with rapid radiative diffusion were first studied by @xcite , who argued that it was a good first order approximation to replace the perturbed energy equation ( [ eqenergypert ] ) with the statement that the temperature perturbation @xmath186 vanishes .",
    "the linearized perturbation equations that we presented in subsection 2.2 can be combined with the perturbed flux - freezing equation to give the total ( gas plus radiation plus magnetic ) pressure perturbation in two radiative diffusion limits .",
    "the first is the adiabatic limit of infinitely slow diffusion ( @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 finite ) , giving @xmath190\\xi_z\\cr & + & \\rho\\left({k_y^2v_{\\rm a}^2\\over\\omega^2}\\right ) \\left[{c_{\\rm",

    "the second is the limit of sufficiently short wavelengths that diffusion is rapid enough ( @xmath192 ) to guarantee that the perturbations are isothermal ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath194\\xi_z .",

    "buoyancy is maximized for a vertically displaced fluid element if it is in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings , i.e. @xmath195 . solving the resulting equation for the eulerian density perturbation associated with an upward fluid element displacement ( @xmath196 ) then gives instability if @xmath197 .",
    "there are two possibilities depending on @xmath73 . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the first @xmath198 term on the right hand sides of equations ( [ eqdptotadiabatic ] ) and ( [ eqdptotrapiddiff ] ) dominates . in this case",
    ", the perturbation involves a straight bundle of field lines , and the resulting mode is called an interchange mode . on the other hand , for @xmath73 sufficiently large , the second @xmath198 term dominates , and the perturbation involves a bending of the field lines , resulting in the undulatory mode .    in the adiabatic limit , the instability criteria for these two modes @xcite are therefore @xmath199    in the rapid diffusion limit , on the other hand , the instability criteria may be written as @xcite @xmath200 these are easier to satisfy than the criteria ( [ newcombcriteria ] ) because pressure and temperature equilibrium between the perturbations and their surroundings makes the fluid hydrodynamically neutrally buoyant .",
    "we consider only the rapid diffusion limit from now on .",
    "using equation ( [ eqdptotrapiddiff ] ) , the linearized continuity and horizontal momentum equations can be combined to express the density and total pressure perturbations entirely in terms of the vertical velocity perturbation : @xmath201 \\label{eqdrhorapiddiff}\\ ] ] and @xmath202 .",

    "these expressions can then be combined with the linearized vertical momentum equation , @xmath204 to give an exact linear ordinary differential equation for the vertical velocity perturbation . in his analysis of the parker instability in the limit of rapid radiative diffusion , @xcite derived a simplified form of this differential equation by first assuming @xmath205 with @xmath61 and @xmath73 remaining finite . from the @xmath206-component of the linearized momentum equation ,",
    "@xmath207 this guarantees that @xmath208 , giving a maximum buoyant response and therefore a maximum parker growth rate .",
    "however , here we will allow for the possibility that @xmath209 is not necessarily small in magnitude as @xmath72 gets large .",
    "this is because the parker cutoff wavenumber @xmath210^{1/2}$ ] can be very large in a radiation dominated plasma , in which the isothermal sound speed in the gas alone @xmath150 can be very small .",
    "( in contrast , in the adiabatic limit , the parker cutoff wavenumber is comparable to the inverse scale height of the background medium . )",
    "because a plasma whose thermal pressure is dominated by radiation is necessarily supported against gravity by radiation pressure and/or magnetic pressure gradients , the parker cutoff wavenumber in the rapid diffusion limit can be much larger than the inverse scale height of the background .",
    "it therefore makes sense to consider the possibility of very large , as well as very small , @xmath73 .",
    "we therefore take @xmath211 , but not necessarily much smaller than @xmath212 . the first derivative term in equation ( [ eqdrhorapiddiff ] ) is higher order than the other terms for short wavelengths , so the density perturbation becomes @xmath213 for the total pressure perturbation in equation ( [ eqdptotrapiddiff1 ] ) , the first derivative term dominates , and @xmath214    substituting into the vertical momentum equation , employing the short wavelength wkb approximation @xmath215 , and simplifying , we finally obtain the dispersion relation @xmath216\\omega^2\\cr & + & k_y^2v_{\\rm a}^4\\left(k_y^2 c_{\\rm i}^2-{gk_\\perp^2\\over 2h_{\\rm mag}k^2}\\right)=0 , \\label{eqngilman}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath217 is the total wavenumber magnitude of the perturbation .",
    "apart from the generalization that @xmath73 and @xmath218 no longer need be considered small compared to @xmath72 , this is identical to equation ( 14 ) of @xcite .",

    "the fluid equations ( [ eqcont])-([eqstate ] ) remain the same , except for two modifications .",

    "we continue to write the vertical gravitational acceleration as @xmath2 , with @xmath234 , the equilibrium radiation flux as @xmath25 , and the equilibrium magnetic field as @xmath24 , i.e. a purely azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "the equilibrium state continues to be described by equations ( [ eqhydrostatic])-([eqraddiff ] ) , but in addition there is now an azimuthal flow velocity of @xmath235 .",
    "the second modification concerns horizontal boundary conditions . in the static analysis",
    ", we considered a horizontally homogeneous equilibrium , and perturbations that were periodic in the horizontal direction ( @xmath236 $ ] ) .",
    "the shearing box has all fluid variables subject to shearing periodic boundary conditions in the radial direction @xcite .",
    "the standard way to treat this is to make a coordinate transformation : @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 .",
