    "the problem of index coding over noiseless broadcast channels was introduced in @xcite and has been well studied @xcite - @xcite .",
    "it involves a single source and a set of caching receivers .",
    "each of the receivers wants a subset of the set of messages transmitted by the source and knows another non - intersecting subset of messages a priori as side information .",
    "the problem is to minimize the number of binary transmissions required to satisfy the demands of all the receivers , which amounts to minimizing the bandwidth required .",
    "an index coding problem @xmath1 , involves a single source , @xmath2 that wishes to send a set of @xmath3 messages @xmath4 to a set of @xmath5 receivers , @xmath6 .",
    "the messages , @xmath7 , @xmath8 take values from some finite field @xmath9 .",
    "a receiver @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is defined as @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the set of messages demanded by @xmath10 and @xmath14 is the set of messages known to @xmath10 , a priori , known as the side information that @xmath10 has .",
    "an index code for the index coding problem with @xmath15 consists of    1 .",
    "an encoding map , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is called the length of the index code , and 2 .   a set of decoding functions @xmath18 such that , for a given input @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "an optimal index code for binary transmissions minimizes @xmath17 , the number of binary transmissions required to satisfy the demands of all receivers .",
    "a linear index code is one whose encoding function is linear and it is linearly decodable if all the decoding functions are linear .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for the class of index coding problems over @xmath21 which can be represented using side information graphs , which were labeled later in @xcite as single unicast index coding problems , the length of optimal linear index code is equal to the minrank over @xmath21 of the corresponding side information graph .",
    "this was extended in @xcite to general index coding problems , over @xmath22 , using minrank over @xmath22 of their corresponding side information hypergraphs .    in this paper , we consider noisy index coding problems with @xmath15 over awgn channels . in the noisy version of index coding ,",
    "the messages are sent by the source over a noisy broadcast channel . instead of binary transmissions",
    "if multilevel ( @xmath23-ary , @xmath24 ) modulation schemes are used further bandwidth reduction can be achieved .",
    "this has been introduced in @xcite for gaussian broadcast channels .",
    "it was also found in @xcite that using @xmath23-ary modulation has the added advantage of giving coding gain to receivers with side information , termed the `` side information gain '' .",
    "the idea of side information gain was characterized for the case where the source use @xmath23-psk for transmitting the index coded bits in @xcite , where @xmath25 , where @xmath17 is the length of the index code used , with the average energy of the @xmath23-qam signal being equal to the total energy of @xmath17 binary transmissions .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that for noisy index coding problems , if we transmit the index coded bits as a point from @xmath26-psk signal set instead of @xmath17 binary transmissions , the receivers satisfying certain conditions will get coding gain in addition to bandwidth gain whereas other receivers trade off coding gain for bandwidth gain .",
    "this gain which was termed as the `` psk side information coding gain '' was obtained by proper mapping of index coded bits to psk symbols an algorithm for which was presented . in this paper , we extend the results in @xcite for the case where we use @xmath26-qam to transmit the @xmath17 index coded bits .",
    "the term * qam bandwidth gain * is defined as the bandwidth gain obtained by each receiver by going from @xmath17 binary transmissions to a single @xmath26-qam symbol transmission .",
    "when we transmit a single @xmath34 signal point instead of transmitting @xmath17 binary transmissions we are going from an @xmath17- real dimensional or equivalently @xmath35 - complex dimensional signal set to 1 complex dimensional signal set .",
    "hence all the receivers get a @xmath35 - fold qam bandwidth gain .",
    "we state this simple fact as    [ lem : qam bg ] each receiver gets an @xmath35 - fold qam bandwidth gain .",
    "the term * qam side information coding gain * ( qam - sicg ) is defined as the coding gain a receiver with a non - empty side information set gets w.r.t a receiver with no side information while using @xmath26-qam to transmit the index coded bits .",
    "let the set @xmath36 , @xmath37 , be defined as the set of all binary transmissions which a receiver @xmath38 knows a priori due to its available side information , i.e. , @xmath39 also , let @xmath40 , @xmath41 be defined as follows .",
    "in this section , we describe an algorithm to map the index coded bits to signal points of an appropriate sized qam constellation so that the receivers satisfying the conditions of theorem [ thm1 ] in the following section will get qam - sicg . for the given index coding problem ,",

    "2 .   use ungerboeck set partitioning @xcite to partition the @xmath26-qam signal set chosen into subsets with increasing minimum subset distances .    to choose the appropriate qam signal set , do the following :    * *",

    "+ if all the signal points in such a subset have been already labeled , then map it to a signal point in another @xmath63 sized subset at the same level @xmath64 that this point together with the signal points corresponding to already mapped codewords in @xmath62 , has the largest minimum distance possible .",

    "@xmath52 * goto * step 3 *    note that algorithm [ algo1 ] above does not result in a unique mapping of index coded bits to @xmath26-qam symbols .",
    "the mapping will change depending on the choice of @xmath67 in each step .",
    "however , the performance of all the receivers obtained using any such mapping scheme resulting from the algorithm will be the same .",
    "if @xmath68 for some @xmath69 , depending on the ordering of @xmath40 done before starting the algorithm , @xmath10 and @xmath70 may give different performances in terms of probability of error .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath70 with @xmath68 will give the same performance if and only if @xmath71 or vice - versa .",
    "in this section we present the main results apart from the algorithm given in the previous section .    [ thm1 ] a receiver @xmath72 gets qam side information coding gain , with the scheme proposed , if and only if @xmath73 , where @xmath17 is the length of the index code used .",
    "consider a receiver @xmath12 .",

    "consists of @xmath63 points .",
    "let @xmath78 the minimum distance of the signal set seen by the receiver @xmath10 , @xmath79    _ proof of the ` if part ' : _ if @xmath73 , then the effective signal set seen by the receiver @xmath10 will have @xmath80 points .",
    "hence by appropriate mapping of index coded bits to qam symbols , we can increase @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath10 will get coding gain over a receiver that has no side information because the minimum distance seen by a receiver with no side information will be the minimum distance of @xmath26-qam signal set .",
    "_ proof of the ` only if part ' : _ let us a consider a receiver @xmath10 such that @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath65 , will not increase .",
    "@xmath65 will remain equal to the minimum distance of the corresponding @xmath82 - qam , same as that of a receiver with no side information .",
    "thus a receiver @xmath10 with @xmath81 will not get qam - sicg .",
    "it is to be noted that the value of @xmath40 not only depends on @xmath83 but also on @xmath84 , which , in turn , depends on the index code chosen .",
    "hence for the same index coding problem , a particular receiver may satisfy theorem [ thm1 ] and get qam - sicg for some index codes and may not get qam - sicg for other index codes .",
    "[ thm2 ] the difference in probability of error performance between the best performing receiver and the worst performing receiver for a given index coding problem , while using @xmath26- qam signal point to transmit the index coded bits , will increase monotonically while @xmath17 increases from @xmath28 to @xmath3 if the following conditions are satisfied . +",
    "( 1 ) the best performing receiver gets qam - sicg .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the worst performing receiver has no side information .",
    "if there is a receiver with no side information , say @xmath85 , whatever the length , @xmath17 , of the index code used is , the effective signal set seen by @xmath85 will be @xmath26-qam .",
    "therefore the minimum distance seen by @xmath85 will be the minimum distance of @xmath26-qam signal set . for @xmath26-qam with average symbol energy equal to @xmath17 , the squared minimum pair - wise distance of @xmath26-qam , @xmath86-qam@xmath87 , obtained by the proposed mapping scheme in algorithm [ algo1 ]",
    "is given by    @xmath88    which is monotonically decreasing in @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the performance of the receiver with no side information deteriorates as the length of the index code increases from @xmath28 to @xmath3 .",
    "although condition ( 1 ) in theorem [ thm2 ] is necessary , the same can not be said about condition ( 2 ) . even when condition ( 2 ) above is not satisfied , i.e. , the worst performing receiver has at least 1 bit of side information but not the same amount of side information as the best performing receiver , the difference between their performances can still increase monotonically as we move from @xmath28 to @xmath3 .",
    "this is because the error performance is determined by the effective minimum distances seen by the receivers , which , in turn , depend on the mapping used between index coded bits and qam symbols .",
    "a general index coding problem can be converted into one where each receiver demands only one message since a receiver @xmath12 can be converted into @xmath89 receivers all with the same side information @xmath90 and each demanding a single message .",
    "so it is enough to consider index coding problems where the receivers demand a single message each and hence both the examples considered in this section are such problems . even though the examples considered are what are called single unicast index coding problems in @xcite , the results hold for any general index coding problem .      in this subsection , we give an example with simulation results to support our claims in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the mapping of index coded bits to qam symbols is done using our algorithm [ algo1 ] .",
    "the receivers which satisfy theorem [ thm1 ] are shown to get qam - sicg .",
    "we also compare the performance of different receivers while using qam and psk to transmit index coded bits . for a given index coding problem and a chosen index code , the mapping of index coded bits to qam symbols",
    "is done using the algorithm described in section [ sec3 ] , whereas the mapping to psk symbols is done using the algorithm 1 in @xcite .",
    "we also give the effective minimum distances which are seen by different receivers which explains the difference in their error performance .",
    "[ ex_psk_qam ] let @xmath917 .",
    "@xmath93 . + the minrank over @xmath21 of the side information graph corresponding to the above problem evaluates to @xmath28=4 .",
