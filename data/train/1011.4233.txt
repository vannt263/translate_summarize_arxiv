    "vanishing electrical resistance is an interesting characteristic , and superconductivity is a well known example of this phenomenon.@xcite another example occurs in the quantum hall two - dimensional electronic system ( 2des ) , where the application of a magnetic field induces zero - resistance states in conjunction with quantized hall resistances at low temperatures.@xcite a third example occurs in the microwave and terahertz irradiated 2des where the radiation induces vanishing resistance states without concurrent hall quantization.@xcite this latter example has shown the possibility of photo - exciting into zero - resistance states in a condensed matter system .",
    "photo - excited transport in the 2des has become a topic of experimental and theoretical interest in the recent past.@xcite periodic in @xmath6 radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , which lead into the radiation - induced zero - resistance states , are now understood to be a consequence of radiation - frequency ( @xmath7 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath8 ) dependent , scattering at impurities @xcite and/or a change in the distribution function.@xcite and , vanishing resistance at the oscillatory minima is asserted to be an outcome of negative resistance instability and current domain formation.@xcite although there has been much progress , there remain many aspects that could be better understood from both the experimental and theoretical perspectives . here , some open problems include understanding ( a ) the observed activated temperature dependence at the resistance minima , ( b ) the role of the potential landscape in influencing the magnitude of the observed oscillatory effect , and ( c ) the nature of the overlap with quantum hall effect.@xcite    a further topic of interest is to examine , in detail , the growth of the oscillatory effect vs. the radiation intensity , @xmath0 .",
    "so far as theoretical results regarding this aspect are concerned , a number of works have numerically evaluated the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations for several @xmath0 and graphically presented the results.@xcite in contrast , dmitriev and co - workers,@xcite have made the prediction that , in the linear response regime , the correction to the dark dc conductivity is linear in @xmath0 , see eqn .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a comparison of experiment with theory , so far as the @xmath0-dependence is concerned , could help to identify the relative importance of the invoked - mechanisms in the above mentioned theories .",
    "further , the novel proposal that these radiation - induced phenomena could constitute a new example of complex emergence , where self - organization can arise from a number of basic interactions with remarkable collective aspects,@xcite has also identified the need to better understand the @xmath0 dependence . finally , as a related issue , it is also of interest to compare the growth of the radiation - induced resistance oscillations with @xmath0 in materials prepared in different laboratories in order to determine whether wafer preparation practices , which influence the scattering landscape within the electronic system and impact the lifetimes / observed characteristics , lead to a perceptible difference in the measurements .",
    "thus , we examine the growth of the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations with @xmath0 in gaas / algaas devices .",
    "we also compare the radiation - induced transport in devices fabricated from mbe material grown by wegscheider ( w ) , with results from similar material prepared by umansky ( u ) .",
    "we find that the radiation - induced oscillatory diagonal resistance , @xmath1 , in both materials can be described by @xmath9 , where @xmath3 is the amplitude , @xmath4 is the damping parameter , and @xmath5 is the @xmath7-dependent magneto - resistance oscillation frequency .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 turn out to be insensitive to @xmath0 and the temperature , @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3 grows nonlinearly with @xmath0 , and the non - linearity depends on the @xmath10 .",
    "such growth of @xmath3 with @xmath0 and @xmath10 has not been predicted .",
    "low frequency lock - in based electrical measurements were carried out at @xmath11 with the samples mounted inside a solenoidal magnet near the open end of a waveguide that is also closed at the other end.@xcite the samples were immersed in pumped liquid - helium , and the temperature was determined with the aid of calibrated resistance thermometers and the vapor - pressure thermometry .",
    "microwaves were conveyed via the waveguide , and the intensity was set at the source , as indicated .",
    "hardware between source and sample introduces intensity attenuation .",
    "a standing wave pattern also produces an axial intensity variation within the waveguide , with a possible further intensity reduction at the sample .",
    "since the @xmath8-field readout of a superconducting magnet power supply is not always reliable at low @xmath8 , the @xmath8-field could be characterized in - situ by performing electron spin resonance ( esr ) of diphenyl - picryl - hydrazal ( dpph ) .",
    "the dpph - esr identifies @xmath8 via the relation @xmath12.@xcite the w - gaas / algaas single heterostructures were nominally characterized by an electron density , @xmath13 and a mobility of @xmath14 .",
    "the u - material was roughly comparable , albeit with a slightly higher @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the 2des s were prepared , as is usual , using the persistent photo - conductivity ( ppc ) effect , with a brief illumination by a led .",
    "since the realized low - temperature @xmath17 and @xmath15 depends upon the cool - down and illumination procedure via the ppc effect , a given specimen can show associated preparation dependent changes in the radiation - induced characteristics .",
    "results are reported here for two sets of measurements , labeled u1 and u2 , on a u - specimen , and measurements , labeled w1 , w2 , and w3 on a set of three w - specimens .",
    "=3 in    figure 1(a ) exhibits the data for a @xmath18 wide hall bar ( w1 ) fabricated from the w - material .",
    "the figure shows the @xmath19 measured both in the dark ( w / o radiation ) and under @xmath20 photo - excitation ( w/ radiation ) .",
    "also shown are @xmath8 calibration markers obtained from the esr of dpph at @xmath21 .",
    "the figure shows large amplitude radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations , as the @xmath22 is reduced to roughly @xmath23 of the dark value at deepest resistance minimum .",
    "further , the w / o radiation @xmath22 trace intersects the w / radiation @xmath22 traces at the nodes of the oscillations.@xcite similar results are obtained on both the left- and right- sides of the device . the small asymmetry observed under @xmath8-reversal",
    "is attributed to an admixture between the diagonal and off - diagonal ( hall ) signals .",
    "=3 in    =3 in    in fig .",
    "1(b ) , @xmath22 on the right ordinate has been plotted vs. @xmath6 in order to exhibit the @xmath6 periodicity of the oscillations . the oscillatory maxima ( minima ) were then assigned with integers ( half - integers ) , see the left ordinate , beginning with @xmath24 for the @xmath22 maximum at the lowest @xmath25 .",
    "the plot of @xmath26 ( left ordinate ) vs. @xmath6 has been subjected to a linear fit , i.e. , @xmath27 , which is represented by the orange curve in fig .",
    "here , @xmath28 represents the phase , and @xmath5 is the frequency of the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations .",
    "thus , the fit extracted @xmath29 , see fig .",
    "1(b ) , confirms a `` 1/4-cycle phase shift''.@xcite in addition , @xmath30 at @xmath31 , suggests that @xmath32 , slightly lower than the standard value , @xmath33 , for gaas / algaas system.@xcite in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the abscissa has been scaled to @xmath25 , using the @xmath5 indicated above .",
    "=3 in    figure 2 presents a direct comparison of the transport characteristics in w1 and u1 at @xmath34 .",
    "figure 2(a ) and ( b ) correspond to the experiment on the u - specimen at @xmath35 , while fig .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) correspond to the w1 experiment at @xmath36 . here",
    ", the dpph - esr @xmath8-markers shown in fig . 2(b ) and 2(d ) served to calibrate @xmath8 for the corresponding experiments .",
    "2(a ) and ( c ) show that both specimens exhibit integer fixed points ( ifp ) at the same @xmath6 .",
    "ifp s are points where the dark @xmath22 trace intersects the photo - excited @xmath22 trace .",
    "ifp s occur in the vicinity of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 equals the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath39.@xcite if two material systems are similar , then one expects the ifp s to occur at the same @xmath6 at constant @xmath7 , and this is what is observed in the data .",
    "thus , for example , the relative diffusion of al into the gaas 2des seems no different in the two systems , since greater diffusion in one system than the other would lead to observable differences in @xmath40 and thus the ifp s .",
    "=3 in    =3 in    to examine the growth of the radiation - induced oscillations with @xmath0 , fig .",
    "3 presents the @xmath1 of u1 for several @xmath0 at @xmath41 .",
    "also shown in the figure are fits to the data using @xmath42 . here ,",
    "a slowly varying background , approximately equaling the dark trace , was removed from the photo - excited @xmath22 data to realize @xmath1 .",
    "although this fit function includes three parameters , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , the oscillation period in @xmath6 is independent of the radiation - intensity , and thus , @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "further , the damping constant , @xmath4,@xcite turns out to be insensitive to @xmath0 , as is evident in fig .",
    "3(b ) , which shows @xmath4 vs. @xmath0 for u1 and u2 .",
    "the small difference in @xmath4 obtained for u1 and u2 in different cool - downs is attributed to the ppc - effect dependence of the electronic properties in the gaas / algaas system .",
    "thus , the main free parameter in the fit - function is the amplitude , @xmath3 , of the oscillations . in fig .",
    "3(c ) , we exhibit the fit extracted @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 for u1 and u2 .",
    "the figure shows the sub - linear growth of @xmath3 with @xmath0 .",
    "also shown are power law fits , @xmath43 . here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for u1 and u2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath46 varies between u1 and u2 because the effective intensity attenuation factor is different in the two experiments .",
    "4(a ) shows power - dependent @xmath1 vs @xmath25 at @xmath47 for w1 , along with lineshape fits . as above",
    ", @xmath5 was insensitive to @xmath0 , and the @xmath5 of w1 agreed with the @xmath5 of u1 , see fig . 2 , and also u2 .",
    "4(b ) exhibits @xmath4 vs. @xmath0 for w1 and w2 .",
    "again , @xmath4 is insensitive @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath48 .",
    "if the damping is written as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent finite frequency broadening temperature and lifetime , respectively,@xcite then the @xmath4 imply that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus , @xmath54 , i.e. , there is more broadening in the u - specimen .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "4(c ) , we exhibit the fit extracted @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 for w1 and w2 .",
    "the figure suggests a nonlinear growth of @xmath3 with @xmath0 .",
    "also shown are the fits , @xmath43 , which suggest that @xmath55 and @xmath56 for w1 and w2 , respectively .    for a third w - specimen labeled w3 , fig .",
    "5 reports the influence of the temperature on the growth of @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 , where @xmath3 is extracted , as before , from line - shape fits of the oscillatory data to @xmath42 .",
    "parenthetically , we note here that such fits suggested a general insensitivity of @xmath4 to the experimental parameters @xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , @xmath57 served to fit all the @xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath0 covered in fig .",
    "5 .    fig . 5(a ) and 5(b ) indicate that , as expected , at a constant @xmath0 , @xmath3 grows with decreasing @xmath10 both at @xmath58 [ fig .",
    "5(a ) ] and @xmath59 [ fig 5(b ) ] .",
    "further , the figures show that the @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 curves exhibit greater curvature at lower temperatures .",
    "the @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 have been fit once again to @xmath43 in order to quantify the observations ; the fit - extracted @xmath60 and @xmath46 have been summarized in tabular form within fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "these fit - extracted @xmath60 have also been plotted vs. @xmath10 in the inset to these figures .",
    "these insets suggest that @xmath60 decreases with decreasing temperatures , consistent with the observed increased non - linearity at lower temperatures . using this result",
    ", one might attribute , at least in part , the smaller @xmath60 in the u - specimens , see fig .",
    "3(c ) , in comparison to the w - specimens w1 and w2 , see fig .",
    "4(c ) , to the lower temperature in the u - measurements .    note that , at @xmath61 , all three w - specimens , with comparable material properties , exhibit the same @xmath60 , within uncertainties , at the lowest pumped @xmath62he temperatures , cf . fig .",
    "4(c ) and fig .",
    "in addition , a comparison of the @xmath60 reported in fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "5(b ) also suggests that reducing the microwave frequency @xmath7 at a fixed @xmath10 tends to reduce the @xmath60 , i.e. , increase the non - linearity .    the nonlinear power law intensity variation reported here",
    "is associated with modest excitation .",
    "it is known that the amplitude of the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations saturates at higher @xmath0 , and further , there is a `` breakdown '' and a decrease in the amplitude at the highest @xmath0.@xcite the results shown thus far in fig . 1 - fig .",
    "5 do not correspond to such high @xmath0 .    to illustrate the behavior in the higher @xmath0 regime",
    ", we exhibit in fig .",
    "6 , the @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 at @xmath31 , when efficient coupling has been realized between the microwave source and the specimen , i.e , when the sample has been located at the intensity peak in the standing wave pattern realized within the waveguide sample - holder . the @xmath63 plot exhibited in fig .",
    "6 shows @xmath3 saturation , and subsequent @xmath3 decrease with increasing @xmath0 , at the highest @xmath0 , consistent with our previous report.@xcite    as mentioned , most theories have exhibited numerically evaluated @xmath22 or @xmath64 including radiation - induced oscillations at several @xmath0,@xcite , while dmitriev et al,@xcite have predicted that the amplitude of the radiation - induced oscillations should increase linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "the results presented here suggest a nonlinear power law increase in a regime characterized by modest excitation .",
    "in summary , consistent experimental results have been obtained for the u- and w- material so far as the essential features of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations are concerned , and this includes the `` 1/4-cycle '' phase shift.@xcite in addition , nonlinear growth is observed in the amplitude of radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations with @xmath0 in both materials .",
    "although fits have been utilized here to quantify the non - linear intensity dependence , such fits are not necessary to perceive the basic non - linear intensity dependence in the raw data .",
