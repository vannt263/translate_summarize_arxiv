    "pressure experiments have played an important hole in understanding high-@xmath4 superconductors ( htsc ) .",
    "several review papers have been written on this subject  @xcite . in short ,",
    "the pressure investigation is a helpful tool to display the potential effects of the chemical pressure , thereby providing useful information for synthesis of related compounds and , more important to the present work , to understand which are the structural parameters that influence the microscopic superconducting mechanism responsible for the htsc .",
    "it is well known that the pressure effects are twofold : ( 1 ) it is documented that the applied pressure @xmath7 increases the hole concentration @xmath5 on the @xmath6 planes  @xcite , with a maximum rate of charge transfer approximately given by @xmath10 .",
    "this is called the pressure induced charge transfer ( pict )  @xcite term . ( 2 ) another pressure effect is the increase of @xmath4 for the optimum doped compound ( @xmath11 ) above the zero pressure value , which indicates another mechanism independent of the pict , known as the  intrinsic \" contribution term  @xcite . recently",
    ", a very large intrinsic term of @xmath12 has been measured  @xcite , however , its origin is still a matter of research .",
    "usually these two effects , the pict and the intrinsic term , have to be combined in order to account for the experimental data on a given family of compounds .",
    "it is very convenient to separate both contribution because the pict can be measured independently by thermal measurements , like the hall coefficient .",
    "some earlier works have estimated the magnitude of both effects through a phenomenological pressure expansion  @xcite applied to the @xmath0 family of compounds .    a method using a bcs - type mean field approach with an extended hubbard hamiltonian",
    "was introduced to derive the phase diagram @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this procedure was used to deal with the pressure effects and it was assumed that , besides the hole content @xmath5 , the pressure also changes the magnitude @xmath2 of the attractive potential , and ultimately changes the zero temperature superconducting gap @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "thus , the critical temperature @xmath15 was obtained as an expansion in powers of @xmath7 , for a determined @xmath5 value , and each contribution was singled out , which is very convenient to interpret the experimental results .",
    "this method was applied to the experimental results of hg 1201 and hg 1223 , with a fixed set of parameters , with excellent agreement with the underdoped and overdoped compounds  @xcite . in a similar approach , also using the bcs method and the extended hubbard hamiltonian , angilella et al  @xcite used the isothermal compressibility tensor to estimate the change of @xmath5 with the pressure and , through the derived @xmath3 , they obtained the variation of the attractive potential @xmath2 with the pressure @xmath7 . in their calculations",
    "they have also taken into account pressure dependence for the lattice parameter @xmath16 , so that the hopping integrals @xmath17 depends on the pressure too ( @xmath18 ) . in this way , they could separate the charge transfer and the intrinsic contribution .",
    "their calculations for the intrinsic term were in good agreement with the measurements of the bi 2212  @xcite .",
    "calculations based on the extended hubbard hamiltonian provide a possible microscopic interpretation for the intrinsic term since it is related with the superconducting interaction @xmath2 . through such calculations ,",
    "one may extract some clues to the behavior of the fundamental microscopic mechanism under the structural changes provided by the applied pressure , and some hints for the mechanism itself .",
    "recently , we have combined both approaches of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to study the measured @xmath19 curves of the @xmath20 series  @xcite .",
    "a characteristic of this method is that , if the phase diagram is experimentally known , @xmath8 can be calculated for the entire family of different @xmath5 compounds , and the value of @xmath21 calculated for this specific family .",
    "our calculated @xmath15 for the @xmath20 series agreed well with the experiments for the extended-@xmath22 wave symmetry  @xcite .    in a recently letter , chen",
    "et al  @xcite have calculated the pressure effects on the nearly optimum doped @xmath9 and underdoped @xmath23 , using a bcs - type method .",
    "using values of @xmath24 averaged from different results of several groups , they obtained very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , calculating @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for different @xmath5 compounds of the @xmath0 family , they found almost the same values for different potential parameters , which led them to conclude that the main contribution to @xmath15 was from the pict term . to check whether the @xmath27 compound has an intrinsic contribution term",
    "or not we have performed calculations on the ybco system using our method .    in our method",
    "we use a bcs approach with the extended hubbard model to calculate the phase diagram of the @xmath0 system , which is compared with the experimental data .",
    "then we take into account the effects produced by the pressure through a change in the intersite potential : as first order approximation we write @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 , with @xmath30 being a constant independent of @xmath7 that will be defined later .",
    "since the structural changes for typical pressures are small , we neglect its effect on the hopping integrals . for the density of hole carriers we use the well know dependence of @xmath5 with @xmath7  @xcite . from this",
    "we estimate the critical temperature @xmath31 as an expansion in terms of the pressure @xmath7 .",
    "our results showed good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "to develop the dynamics of the hole - type carriers in the cu - o planes , we adopt a two dimension extended hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite in a square lattice of lattice parameter @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hopping integral between sites @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; @xmath1 is the coulomb on - site correlated repulsion and @xmath37 is the attractive interaction between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the transformation of eq.([b ] ) to the momentum space leads to the appearance of the dispersion relation . in order to compare with ybco system",
    ", we used a dispersion relation within a tight - binding approximation , which may be compared with the one estimated from arpes measurements  @xcite .",
    "thus ,    @xmath38    where it was considered identical hopping integrals along both directions in the cu - o planes for the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath39=@xmath40=@xmath41 ) , a different one for the next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath42 ) , and so on .",
    "here it was considered a hopping from the first to the fifth neighbor .",
    "equation ( [ e ] ) is in agreement with the one given by schabel et al  @xcite ; @xmath43 is the chemical potential which controls the hole concentration .    like the low temperature superconductors , the htsc exhibit an energy  gap \" ( order parameter ) in the superconducting phase which separates the paired states from the single - particle states . using a bcs - type mean - field approximation  @xcite to develop eq.([b ] ) in the momentum space , one obtains the self - consistent gap equation , at finite temperatures  @xcite    @xmath44    with @xmath45 which contains the interaction potential @xmath46 that comes from the transformation to the momentum space of eq.([b ] )  @xcite    @xmath47     for the @xmath48 wave and extended-@xmath22 wave symmetries , with the experimental data of the @xmath0 taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ( open squares).,width=302 ]    the substitution of eq.([d ] ) into eq.([cc ] ) leads to appearance of a gap with two distinct symmetries  @xcite :    @xmath49 , \\label{gg}\\ ] ]    where the plus sign is for extended-@xmath22 wave and the minus sign , for @xmath48 wave symmetry . in accordance with ref  @xcite one",
    "observes that the @xmath48 wave part of the gap do not depend on the coupling constant @xmath1 , depending only on @xmath2 .",
    "the extended-@xmath22 symmetry depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "as it is well known  @xcite at the critical temperature there is no symmetry mixture , and the gap might be in the extended-@xmath22 or @xmath48 wave state when @xmath50 .",
    "using the same bcs - type mean - field approximation used in the gap equation one obtains the hole - content equation  @xcite    @xmath51    where @xmath52 .",
    "this equation , together with the gap equatios and the dispersion relation , are solved numerically self - consistently , in the limit of @xmath50 , in order to obtain the phase diagrams for both gap symmetry .    to compare with the experimental results for the y123 system , we perform our calculations with the hopping integrals : @xmath41=0.32ev as the nearest - neighbor value ; for @xmath42 it was adopted the ratio @xmath53=0.50 for the @xmath48-wave symmetry and @xmath53=0.57 for the extended-@xmath22 ; the remaining band parameters followed : @xmath54=0.16 , @xmath55=0.11 , and @xmath56=0.031 .",
    "all these values are close to the arpes measurements on y123 system  @xcite .    using these band parameters we first estimated the coupling constant @xmath2 , using the @xmath48-wave gap symmetry , reproducing the experimental phase diagram of ref .",
    "the best value obtained was @xmath2=-0.1152ev .",
    "for the case of the extended-@xmath22 gap symmetry , the value @xmath1=0.0096ev was obtained , using the same coupling constant @xmath2 of the @xmath48-wave .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath43 is calculated self - consistently .",
    "fig.1 shows the results of our numerical calculations together with the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 series .",
    "to calculate the variations of @xmath4 for a given compound with a certain value @xmath5 , and under pressure @xmath7 , we may use an expansion of @xmath15 in powers of @xmath7 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath57    where    @xmath58    here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are constant parameters , which are determined fitting the experimental data for a given system .",
    "@xmath61 is the critical temperature for @xmath7=0 .",
    "equation ( [ k ] ) can be written in a compact form , as    @xmath62    with    @xmath63    the first coefficient ( @xmath64 ) for the above expression is given by    @xmath65    it is important to stress that the first term in @xmath66 is the intrinsic contribution , and the second one is the pict contribution .",
    "therefore , both contribution can be singled out . restricting ourselves to small changes @xmath2 , we may approximate    @xmath67     for the @xmath48-wave showing the effect of a change on the coupling constant @xmath2 , together with the experimental data of the @xmath0 taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ( open squares).,width=302 ]    where the horizontal bar denotes a  mean \" over the values of @xmath4 obtained direct from the phase diagram as a function of @xmath2 , as it is shown in fig.2 .",
    "mean \" is realized for each value of @xmath5 . to obtain @xmath68",
    "we may either use an experimental value , or use directly the curves of fig.2 , as done here .",
    "one can also use a phenomenological universal parabolic relation between @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite . for the coefficient @xmath69 we have    @xmath70    thus",
    ", @xmath69 becomes    @xmath71    the other coefficients of the expansion can be obtained using the same procedure .",
    "first of all , one observes that , at low pressures only the linear term ( @xmath66 ) of the expansion @xmath15 comes into play .",
    "therefore , we can approximate @xmath66 as the slope of the initial points of the @xmath72 curve , for a given @xmath5 compound . starting with @xmath5=@xmath11",
    ", we determine @xmath30 using the estimated @xmath66 in eq.([p ] ) , as long as at @xmath11 the charge transfer term vanishes .",
    "to determine @xmath73 we obtain @xmath66 from the @xmath19 curve of an @xmath74 compound , and use again eq.([p ] ) .",
    "once these two constants are determined , the @xmath75 coefficients for any @xmath5 value can be calculated ( eq.([n ] ) ) .    for the @xmath0 system",
    "we only have the non zero pressure data for the @xmath5=@xmath11=0.165 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath5=0.15 ( @xmath77 ) compounds  @xcite .",
    "thus , from the @xmath19 curves of ref .",
    "@xcite we estimate @xmath78 and 1.4 @xmath79 for @xmath11 and @xmath5=0.15 , respectively .",
    "the phase diagram parameters ( @xmath80 ) taken from fig.2 and used in the calculations were 1652@xmath81 and 1475@xmath82 for the @xmath48-wave and 1164@xmath81 and 1099@xmath81 for the extended-@xmath22 wave for @xmath11 and @xmath5=0.165 compounds , respectively .",
    "therefore , the resulting constants for the @xmath48-wave were @xmath83 which furnishes an intrinsic contribution of 0.8@xmath79 , and @xmath84 which is the charge transfer term ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "for the extended-@xmath22 we obtained @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is important to mention that our values for @xmath88 ( the intrinsic contribution ; see eq.([p ] ) ) were in the same order of magnitude of neumeier and zimmermann  @xcite , despite the difference in the approaches .",
    "-wave results , while the long - dashed lines are the extended-@xmath22 wave results . the open squares and filled squares",
    "are experimental data of @xmath0 taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively.,width=302 ]    on fig.3 we compare the @xmath15 expansion with the experimental data .",
    "we observe a very good agreement for both compounds , specially for @xmath11 , using the @xmath48-wave gap symmetry , where the data can be fitted up to 20 @xmath89 .",
    "the increase of @xmath11 with the pressure is attributed to the intrinsic contribution in our theory , and the maximum @xmath4 at @xmath90 and subsequent decrease is due to the negative second order term of the expansion , which reflects the effect of the pict .",
    "the extended-@xmath22 wave results did not show good results indicating a preference for the @xmath48-wave pairing mechanism for the y-123 system .",
    "we conclude this letter emphasizing that our method based on the bcs approach with the extended hubbard model , with both the attractive potential @xmath2 and the density of carriers @xmath5 depending on the pressure @xmath7 , predicted an intrinsic term and a pict contribution similar to those predicted earlier  @xcite . in our method we propose a direct pressure dependence for the attractive potential @xmath2 , which is different from other works  @xcite that use @xmath2 as an adjustable parameter in order to fit the known experimental dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath7 .",
    "our results for the @xmath48-wave are in excellent agreement with the y-123 pressure data and , the intrinsic term being the most important contribution to the low pressure data on the optimum compound . concerning the underdoped compound the intrinsic and pict contribution are both present and must",
    ", as previously known by several experiments and theories  @xcite , be taken into account .",
    "such results support the @xmath48-wave symmetry in these compounds ."
