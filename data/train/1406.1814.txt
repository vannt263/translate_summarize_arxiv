    "in this short communication we present an original way to couple the brownian motion and the heat equation .",
    "the method can be used to describe , in a new multiscale fashion , diffusion - based multiscale phenomena and dual - nature phenomena , like , e.g. , the wave - particle duality of elementary particles in quantum mechanics .",
    "this paper falls in the context of multiscale methods for the numerical solution of problems based on ( stochastic ) odes and pdes arising in mathematics , physics , and engineering .",
    "relevant literature is huge , see , e.g. , the book @xcite for a quick overview . although details can change considerably from method to method , a general idea behind multiscale modeling is to provide different levels of mathematical description for phenomena occurring at different scales . in 2011",
    "the paper @xcite proposed a modeling technique for advection problems whereby the micro and macro levels are advanced in time concurrently in the whole domain , and they are coupled together via a `` blending '' parameter , say @xmath0 $ ] , which measures the relative weight of one description over the other , say @xmath1 for fully macro and @xmath2 for fully micro . in different words",
    ", one defines a mesoscopic blend of two replicas of the same system , similar in spirit , although not in mathematical content , to mesoscopic approaches to multiscale modeling . the main idea behind this approach is to keep the two replicas in constant interaction .",
    "this allows to describe systems where the microscopic level must be observed everywhere and at any time , because , e.g. , granular properties are never and nowhere negligible .",
    "this kind of systems can be found in several contexts like crowd dynamics , financial mathematics , and complex systems in general ( consider , e.g. the well - known _ herding behavior _",
    ", where the choice of single individuals influence the mass and vice versa ) .",
    "the price to pay is the computational cost of keeping the two solvers active always and everywhere , a cost that can hopefully be optimized by minimizing the number of microscopic degrees of freedom . besides the computational aspects",
    ", however , this `` replica '' approach has the conceptual appeal of treating the micro and macro levels at the same footing , which might prove advantageous to describe systems which display genuine physical duality , like the wave - particle duality in quantum mechanics .",
    "in this section we derive a way to couple the brownian motion and the heat equation . for the sake of clarity , in the following we restrict the discussion to dimension one .",
    "let us consider the following system of stochastic differential equations @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath5 is the one  dimensional brownian motion ( standard wiener process ) , @xmath6 is the number of particles under observation , and @xmath7 their positions at time @xmath8 .",
    "the associated fokker ",
    "planck equation is the heat equation @xmath9 u(0,\\,x)=\\delta_0 , & x\\in{\\mathbb r } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the dirac delta centered in 0 .",
    "the solution @xmath11 to ( [ heateq_parab ] ) describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the brownian motions generated by ( [ sdes ] ) @xcite , i.e.@xmath12 the solution to the heat equation ( [ heateq_parab ] ) is @xmath13 for our purposes , it is useful to define a _ macroscopic velocity field _ @xmath14 as @xmath15 so that the heat equation can be formally written as @xmath16 the form ( [ heateq_iperb ] ) makes the velocity field @xmath14 , which transports the probability density function , appear explicitly .",
    "note that this `` hyperbolic '' formulation is valid if @xmath17 , i.e.  if @xmath18 . by ( [ eq : sol_esatta_calore_1d ] ) and ( [ def_vm ] ) we have @xmath19",
    "let us introduce a structured space - time grid with spatial cell size @xmath20 and a time step @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the grid nodes by @xmath22 , for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the space cells by @xmath25 , and by @xmath26 the approximate value of a generic function @xmath27 at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    to avoid to manage the initial datum @xmath10 at the discrete level",
    ", we set the initial time for the simulation at @xmath30 and , consequently , the new initial datum @xmath31 . in this way",
    "we can safely assume that @xmath32 for any @xmath33 .",
    "the computational domain is set at @xmath34\\times[-x_\\textup{b},x_\\textup{b}]$ ] , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we choose @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) . without loss of generality , in the numerical tests we always set @xmath42 .",
    "the ito processes satisfying ( [ sdes ] ) can be approximated by using the weak euler scheme @xmath43 where @xmath44 are independent two - point random variables with @xmath45 .",
    "the discrete velocities of the particles can be computed _ a posteriori _ as @xmath46 ( note that the velocity tends correctly to @xmath47 as @xmath48 ) . at time @xmath49 , we assume that microscopic particles @xmath50 are distributed with probability density @xmath51 .",
    "given the particles positions , we recover the approximate probability density function by @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the characteristic function .",
    "note that @xmath54 is the mass carried by each particle , the total mass being @xmath55 .",
    "equation ( [ heateq_parab ] ) can be easily discretized by means of a first - order centered - in - space and forward - in - time finite difference scheme @xmath56      a preliminary coupling of the microscopic and macroscopic scale can be obtained by assuming that the solution @xmath11 to the heat equation ( [ heateq_parab ] ) is known , see ( [ eq : sol_esatta_calore_1d ] ) , and then solving the equation for @xmath57 s , duly coupling the original microscopic velocity field and the macroscopic velocity field ( [ vm_esplicito ] ) . following slavishly @xcite , we should blend the two velocity fields by a convex combination getting @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "surprisingly enough ( or not ? ) , this choice does not give the desired result , in the sense that the corresponding probability density function @xmath60 does not approximate correctly the function @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "a good scale interpolation is obtained instead by setting , at any time step @xmath63 and for any particle @xmath64 , @xmath65 y^k_n+\\frac{y^k_n}{2t_n}{\\delta{t } } , & \\textrm{with prob.\\ } ( 1-\\theta ) . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    figure  [ fig : partialcouplingmicro ] shows the solution to ( [ eq : partialcouplingmicro ] ) ( with @xmath66 ) and the corresponding probability density function @xmath60 ( with @xmath67 ) at final time @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "we notice that the brownian motion is regularized as expected since the trajectories are gradually more and more smooth as @xmath70 goes to 0 , while numerical evidence shows that the overall statistical properties of the collective dynamics are kept .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the coupling technique presented in this paper allows to blend the brownian motion and the heat equation .",
    "the question arises why one should find convenient to blend the scales in this way . in @xcite",
    "the authors deal with granular flow and the power of the `` convex combination '' ruled by the parameter @xmath70 is evident , because the macrosolver is not able , alone , to catch the natural break of symmetry of the particles density actually observed in reality , which is ultimately triggered by microscopic effects .",
    "if , instead , the macrosolver is able to describe the dynamics in full detail , as it happens here , the coupling seems not to represent a real value added .",
    "however , we think that the ideas presented here can be extended to more general diffusion - based equations modeling more complex phenomena , where the description at different scales _ is not perfectly symmetrical . _",
    "this means that the microscopic description is actually richer than the macroscopic one and single particles are responsible for the onset of some phenomenon ( e.g. , break of symmetry , fractures ) which is then visible at large scale . in such new contexts ,",
    "the constant presence of the microscale is crucial , but at the same time one wants to avoid tracking _ all _ the particles , and prefers letting the macrosolver take the place of a part of them .",
    "the coupling seems also to be conceptually suitable to describe physical duality in quantum mechanics , even in the case of perfectly symmetric micro and macro descriptions .",
    "to do so , some ideas can be borrowed by the lattice boltzmann method @xcite .    a main open problem is given by the choice of @xmath70 .",
    "is there an optimal value for the coupling parameter ?",
    "we think that the answer is necessarily problem - dependent .",
    "likely , a good parameter @xmath71 will be time- and space - dependent ( it could the solution of an additional pde ) . a first investigation in this direction",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that our multiscale approach avoids to deal with classical micro - macro interfaces .",
    "the dynamics can be described at macrolevel ( @xmath1 ) in a subomain and at macromicrolevel ( @xmath72 $ ] ) in another subdomain .",
    "then , the hand - shaking at the boundary of the subdomains is done at macroscale level only ( i.e.  macro - with - macro , neglecting the microscale ) . in this way we get an easy seamless exchange of information , cf .  @xcite .",
    "the author wants to thank s. succi , b. piccoli , a. tosin , s. cacace , and the anonymous referee for the useful suggestions , and a. einstein for the inspiration .",
