    "dwarf novae belong to a subclass of cataclysmic variable stars that consist of a white dwarf ( primary ) and a late - type star ( secondary ) .",
    "the secondary star fills its roche lobe and transfers mass to the primary via inner lagragian point ( l1 ) and the transferred matter forms an accretion disk ( for a review , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . among dwarf novae ,",
    "there exist three subtypes based on their light curves .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae , whose orbital period are shorter than 0.1 days in the most cases , are one of the subtypes , characteristic of exhibiting two types of outbursts .",
    "one is normal outburst , continuing for a few days .",
    "the other is superoutburst , lasting about two weeks , during which modulations called superhumps are shown .",
    "the period of the superhumps are a few percent longer than that of the orbital period of the system .",
    "this is well explained by a phase - dependent dissipation of a tidally deformed precessing accretion disk .",
    "the most acceptable model for su uma stars is the thermal - tidal instability model developed by @xcite , well reproducing the majority of observations .",
    "v844 her was discovered by @xcite as a variable star near @xmath0 her .",
    "@xcite classified the variable , originally named var 43 her , as a dwarf nova based on the detection of a long outburst .",
    "the light curve in @xcite is reminiscent of a superoutburst of su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "time - resolved ccd photometry was performed by @xcite during the 1999 september outburst of v844 her . detecting superhumps with a period of 0.05592(2 ) days , they firstly confirmed the su uma nature of v844 her . by radial velocity studies @xcite determined 0.054643(7 ) days ( 78.69 min ) as the orbital period of the system .",
    "these results indicate that v844 her is one of the shortest periods among dwarf novae ever known . in order to thoroughly investigate the short period system ,",
    "the vsnet @xcite has placed v844 her as one of the highest priorities since the confirmation of the su uma nature of the system . in 2002 may , 2002 october , and 2003 october ,",
    "v844 her underwent an outburst and the vsnet collaboration team detected superhumps during these superoutbursts .    on 2006 april 24 , pavol a. dubovsky reported a brightening of v844 her ( 12.4 mag ) to the vsnet ( [ vsnet - alert 8914 ] ) . thanks to this prompt report , as well as the seasonal condition of v844 her ( the precise coordinate is ra : @xmath1 , dec : @xmath2 , @xcite ) , we firstly succeeded in observing almost the whole superoutburst of v844 her .",
    "the object is identical with usno a2.0 1275 - 8931436 ( @xmath3 = 16.9 , @xmath4 = 16.2 ) .",
    "the infrared counterpart of the binary is 2mass j16250181 + 3909258 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "v844 her is also catalogued as a bright x - ray source by rosat , 1rxs j162501.2 + 390924 .",
    "time - resolved ccd photometry during outburst was performed from 2002 may 20 to 2006 may 20 using 10 - 100 cm telescopes at 8 sites .",
    "the log of these observations is summarized in table 1 .",
    "details of observers are listed in table 2 . in total , we observed v844 her for 31 nights , during which 4 outbursts including one normal outburst were detected .",
    "the exposure time was 10 - 40 seconds .",
    "the read - out time was typically a few seconds .",
    "the resultant cadence is much shorter than the time scale of variations that we focus on .",
    "photometric data were obtained through the @xmath5 filter at the kolonica saddle site .",
    "the other sites used no filter , which makes the effective wavelength close to that of @xmath6-system .",
    "the total data points amounted to 14674 , which is the largest data ever obtained for v844 her .",
    "after subtracting a dark - current image from the original ccd frames , flat fielding was performed as the usual manner .",
    "the images obtained by mhh and ku were processed by the task apphot in iraf .",
    "kyoto , ous , riken , and okayama data were analyzed by aperture photometry using a java - based software developed by one of the authors ( tk ) .",
    "data of mie were analyzed using fitsphot4.1 .",
    "the maxim dl and the c@xmath7munipack were used for data obtained at kolonica saddle . after correcting systematic differences between sites ,",
    "the magnitude was adjusted to that of kyoto system except for 2006 observations , for which the magnitude was adjusted to that of saitama system . as comparison stars , usno a2.0 1275 - 8932542 ( ra : @xmath8 , dec : @xmath9 , @xmath5=12.836 , @xmath10=0.994 ) and usno - a2.0 1292 - 0262723 ( ra : @xmath11 , dec : @xmath12 , @xmath5=12.334 , @xmath10=0.662 )",
    "were used for kyoto and saitama system , respectively @xcite .",
    ", whose constancy was checked by the local stars in the same images .",
    "heliocentric correction was applied to the observation times before the following analyses .",
    "the light curve during the 2002 may outburst is presented in figure [ fig:0205lc ] .",
    "the magnitude declined linearly at the rate of 0.13(1 ) mag d@xmath13 until hjd 2452420 , after which the system kept almost constant magnitude until the end of our run .",
    "such a halt is sometimes observed in other su uma - type dwarf novae ( e.g. , v1028 cyg , @xcite . for a comprehensive review ,",
    "see @xcite ) . on hjd 2452425 , 12 days after the detection of the outburst , v844 her likely entered the rapid decline stage , when the visual magnitude was fainter than 15 .",
    "figure [ fig:0205mhp ] shows the representative light curves during the plateau phase after removing daily decline trends for each run .",
    "rapid rises and slow declines , characteristic of superhumps , are visible . in order to estimate the superhump period , we applied the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm , @xcite ) method to the prewhitened light curves during the plateau stage .",
    "we determined 0.05584(64)d as being the best estimated period of the superhump .",
    "the error of the resulting period was estimated using the lafter@xmath7kinman class of methods as applied by @xcite .",
    "the obtained superhump period was in good agreement with the previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we extracted the maximum times of superhumps calibrated mainly by eye .",
    "tbl:02o - c ] shows the timings of the superhump maxima . a linear regression to the observed times yields the ephemeris in the following equation :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the cycle count of the maximum timings of superhumps , and the values within the parentheses in the right side of the equation denote 1-@xmath16 error , respectively .",
    "using the above equation , we derived the @xmath17 diagram illustrated in figure [ fig:0205o - c ] , in which the dashed line means the best fitting quadratic equation as follows :    @xmath18    the quadratic term yields @xmath19 = @xmath20/@xmath21 = 4.4(1.2)@xmath2210@xmath23 , indicating that superhump period increases through the superoutburst . because of the apparent sparse data listed in table [ tbl:02o - c ] , it is likely that the obtained value might include large uncertainty",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude the conspicuous increase in the superhump period during the plateau stage .",
    "figure [ fig:0210lc ] shows the light curve of our run during the 2002 october outburst .",
    "the outburst was caught on hjd 2452571 , when the visual magnitude of v844 her was about 12.5 .",
    "our observations started one night after the detection , when the mean magnitude was about 13.3 . using the data",
    "obtained on the first two nights , we determined the mean decline rate to be 1.20(1 ) mag d@xmath13 .",
    "the value is large for the plateau stage of a superoutburst in su uma - type dwarf novae . on hjd 2452575 , v844",
    "her faded to 17 mag , which is almost the same as that of the quiescent magnitude .",
    "based on the negative observation on hjd 2452570 , we can estimate that the duration of the outburst was at most 5 days .",
    "figure [ fig:0210e ] represents the de - trended , enlarged light curves taken on the first two nights .",
    "interestingly , one can see hump - like profiles on 2002 october 25 ( hjd 2452573 ) with the amplitude as large as 0.4 mag .",
    "they are , however , definitely not superhumps , since three peaks are detectable with an amplitude of @xmath24 0.4 mag during the 0.06 days run .",
    "these results indicate this outburst was the normal outburst .",
    "this is the first recorded @xmath25 @xmath26 of v844 her .",
    "figure [ fig:0310lc ] displays the overall light curves during the 2003 outburst of v844 her .",
    "the duration of the outburst appeared to be about 2 weeks .",
    "the decline rate of 0.12(1 ) mag d@xmath13 until hjd 2452945 , which is a typical value for su uma - type dwarf novae . due to the absence of observations between hjd 2452945 and hjd 2452951",
    ", we can not specify whether there was a phase of a constant magnitude , as was observed in the 2002 may superoutburst .",
    "after the plateau stage , v844 her entered the rapid decline phase around hjd 2452956 , and the magnitude returned to its quiescent level on hjd 2452958 .",
    "no rebrightenings were observed during our run . due to the lack of our observations , we were unable to trace superhump period change and whether a precursor was present .",
    "the whole light curve of the 2006 april - may outburst is shown in figure [ fig:0604lc ] .",
    "the duration of the plateau phase was about 2 weeks .",
    "the magnitude declined almost constantly at the rate of 0.15(1 ) mag d@xmath13 from hjd 2453851 to hjd 2453860 , after which the magnitude kept almost constant at the end of the plateau stage . on hjd 2453867 ,",
    "v844 her became faint with the magnitude of 16.5 .",
    "there provided no evidence of a rebrightening during our run .",
    "figure [ fig:0604e ] shows the enlarged light curves on the first two days of our observations .",
    "there is no signal of superhumps on hjd 2453851 , while there were hump - like modulations on hjd 2453853 .",
    "however , their profile suggested that superhumps had not yet fully grown .",
    "then we suppose the superhumps were detected form hjd 2453854 .",
    "we performed a period analysis using the 7473 points between hjd 2453854 and hjd 2453864 , after subtracting the linear declining trend .",
    "the theta diagram of the pdm analysis provides the best estimated period of 0.055883(3)d .",
    "this value is in good accordance with that obtained during the 2002 may superoutburst .",
    "figuer [ fig:0604dlc ] indicates the daily averaged light curves during the plateau phase folded by 0.055883(3)d .",
    "a rapid rise and slow decline are a typical feature of superhumps .",
    "the data obtained on april 28(hjd 2453854 ) showed the superhumps with an amplitude of 0.2 mag , then the superhump amplitude decreased gradually .",
    "a hint of the regrowth of the superhump can be seen on may 5(hjd 2453861 ) .",
    "the superhump maximum timings measured by eye are listed in table 4 . a linear regression yields the following equation on the superhump maximum timings ;    @xmath27    the obtained @xmath17 diagram is exhibited in figure [ fig:0604o - c ] . for @xmath71",
    "< @xmath15 < 128 , the best fitting quadratic equation is given by :    @xmath28    this equation yields @xmath19 = @xmath20/@xmath21=10.9(1.0 ) @xmath2210@xmath23 , meaning that the superhump period increases through the superoutburst .",
    "it is well known that an accurate estimation of the distance to the dwarf novae is not easy .",
    "nevertheless , we can roughly estimate it using an empirical relation derived by @xcite as follows :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the absolute magnitude at the maximum during a normal outburst , and @xmath21 is the orbital period of the system in the unit of hours .",
    "the above equation could be applied for the systems which have a low inclination and do not reach the period minimum .",
    "based on the previous investigations by @xcite , both conditions can be satisfied for v844 her . substituting @xmath21=1.3115 into equation ( [ eqn : mv ] ) and with a little algebra ( here we assume that the maximum @xmath5 magnitude of v844 her is 12.6 )",
    ", we roughly derived d=290(30 ) pc as an estimated distance .",
    "using the obtained distance , we can also estimate the x - ray luminosity of v844 her following the same manner as @xcite , who showed that the @xmath31 pspc countrate in channel 52 - 201 corresponds to a flux in the 0.5 - 2.5 kev bandpass given by    @xmath32    where cr@xmath33 denotes the countrate in channel 52 - 201 . with a little algebra ,",
    "we can obtain the x - ray luminosity between 0.5 - 2.5 kev is 10@xmath34 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "although the observed x - ray luminosity will be affected by some effects including the inclination of the system , the derived value is relatively large compared to other su uma - type dwarf novae given by @xcite .",
    "historically , the superhump period had been known to decrease during the course of the superoutburst before the tidal instability was discovered (;",
    "the decrease of superhump period was ascribed to shrinkage of the disk radius , or simply a natural consequence of mass depletion from the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "recently , particularly over the past decade , the picture has been altered since numerous systems showed an increase of the superhump period .",
    "such systems are mainly wz sge - type dwarf novae , and su uma - type dwarf novae with short orbital periods ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , there appears to be a borderline around @xmath35=0.063 days below which the superhump period tends to increase @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : p - d ] illustrates the superhump period derivative against the mean superhump period of su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the value for v844 her is pointed with the filled circles . in figure",
    "[ fig : p - d ] , v844 her is likely to lie in the general trend .",
    "hence , we firstly confirmed that v844 her showed the positive @xmath19 derivative and became the shortest period su uma - type dwarf nova that was confirmed to exhibit an increase of the superhump period .",
    "additionally , we should briefly note on figure [ fig:0604o - c ] , where one can see data points departured from the quadratic equation ( [ eqn:06o - c ] ) , corresponding to @xmath15 @xmath24 @xmath720 .",
    "recent ccd photometry indicates that this feature is observed not only for v844 her , but also for other short period su uma - type stars exhibiting the positive @xmath19 .",
    "the systems include asas 102522 - 1542.4 ( maehara et al . in preparation ) , fl tra ( imada et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) , asas 160048 - 4846.2 ( @xcite ; imada et al . in preparation ) .",
    "theoretical models suggest a dramatic variation in temperature or pressure in the accretion disk is a possible cause of the superhump period change in this stage ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we require further samples in order to discuss the nature of the superhump period change at this early stage .",
    "it is well known that su uma - type dwarf novae show two types of superoutbursts : superoutbursts with a precursor , and superoutbursts without a precursor , though precursor - main superoutburst is hardly observed . for superoutbursts without a precursor , a handful of systems , especially archetype toads wx cet and sw uma , show three types of superoutburst : a short superoutburst with a duration as short as 10 days , an intermediate superoutburst continuing for 2 weeks , and a long superoutburst lasting longer than 20 days @xcite . in the case of v844 her ,",
    "all the three superoutbursts reported here lasted about 2 weeks , suggesting that these superoutbursts belong to the intermediate category , or v844 her simply lies in the majority of su uma - type dwarf novae .    in order to examine whether v844 her shows other types of superoutbursts , we extracted the observations reported to aavso and vsnet since the 1996 discovery .",
    "table [ tbl : pre_outbursts ] summarizes the recorded outbursts of v844 her , from which we can properly give a constraint on the durations of outbursts .",
    "as can be noticed in table [ tbl : pre_outbursts ] , no superoutburst provides evidence for a duration longer than 20 days , and the durations of the superoutbursts appears to converge to 2 weeks . from the archives",
    ", we newly discovered two facts .",
    "one is that v844 her shows no precursor .",
    "of course we have overlooked the onset of superoutburst in a few cases , for which we can not specify the type of superoutburst .",
    "however , the absence of a precursor has been confirmed in the most cases of the superoutbursts by virtue of the amateur observers .",
    "the other is that no rebrightenings have been observed in v844 her despite careful monitoring of the system since the 1996 discovery @xcite .",
    "recent extensive studies over the past decades suggest that rebrightenings tend to occur among su uma - type dwarf novae with short orbital periods ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most interesting fact is , although it has been mentioned for a long time , that v844 her shows almost no normal outbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . from the viewpoint of the original thermal - tidal instability model ,",
    "normal outbursts occur more frequently as the mass transfer rate from the secondary increases ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further , the optical spectrum of v844 her suggests a relatively high mass transfer rate @xcite , which accelerates a circulation on the limit cycle in the @xmath36-@xmath37 diagram . from table",
    "[ tbl : pre_outbursts ] , the supercycle of v844 her is estimated to be about 300 days , which is in agreement with the previous work @xcite .",
    "when compared to the other systems having similar supercycles , e.g. , z cha , the peculiarity of v844 her becomes much clear with respect to the absence of normal outbursts .",
    "although we can not draw a firm conclusion against the infrequent normal outbursts , one possibility is that evaporation in the accretion disk is working well so that a hole is created in the inner region of the disk and avoids an outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the model also suggests large x - ray luminosity @xcite and expansion of the accretion disk during quiescence @xcite .",
    "as for the former , the relatively large x - ray luminosity of v844 her may be suggestive of the evaporation .",
    "the latter should be investigated by peak - separation studies during quiescence .",
    "in this paper , we reported on time resolved ccd photometry during 2002 may , 2002 october , 2003 october , and 2006 april outbursts , of which three were superoutburst .",
    "we estimated the mean superhump periods of 0.05584(64)d for 2002 may and 0.055883(3)d for 2006 april superoutbursts , respectively .",
    "we successfully examined superhump period change during the 2002 may and 2006 april superoutburst .",
    "the resultant period derivatives showed an period increase of superhumps during the plateau stages in both superoutbursts , which we confirmed in v844 her for the first time .",
    "we also derived the distance to v844 her to be 290(30 ) pc . using the value ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity between 0.5 and 2.5 kev is estimated 10@xmath34 erg s@xmath13 .    to appreciate the long - term behavior of v844 her",
    ", we investigated the archival light curves since the discovery of the variable . using the extensive data",
    ", we estimated a possible supercycle to be @xmath24 300 days , which is in good agreement with @xcite . from the archives , it turned out that v844 her shows neither precursors nor rebrightenings , although we can not rule out the possibility that we missed a few events .",
    "we also confirmed that v844 her shows almost no normal outbursts in spite of the intermediate supercycle among su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "a possible explanation on the absence of a normal outburst is that the evaporation mechanism may play a role , which is consistent with the relatively large x - ray luminosity of v844 her . in the future",
    ", the evolution of the disk radius during quiescence should be investigated in order to test our suggestion .",
    "we are grateful to many observers who have reported vital observations .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the variable star observations from the aavso and vsnet international database contributed by observers worldwide and used in this research . this work is supported by a grant - in - aid for the 21st century coe `` center for diversity and universality in physics '' from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) .",

    "<S> we successfully determined the mean superhump periods to be 0.05584(64 ) days , and 0.055883(3 ) for the 2002 may superoutburst , and the 2006 april - may superoutburst , respectively . during the 2002 october observations </S>",
    "<S> , we confirmed that the outburst is a normal outburst , which is the first recorded normal outburst in v844 her . </S>",
    "<S> we also examined superhump period changes during 2002 may and 2006 april - may superoutbursts , both of which showed increasing superhump period over the course of the plateau stage . in order to examine the long - term behavior of v844 her </S>",
    "<S> , we analyzed archival data over the past ten years since the discovery of this binary . </S>",
    "<S> although photometry is not satisfactory in some superoutbursts , we found that v844 her showed no precursors and rebrightenings . </S>",
    "<S> based on the long - term light curve , we further confirmed v844 her has shown almost no normal outbursts despite the fact that the supercycle of the system is estimated to be about 300 days . in order to explain the long - term light curves of v844 her , evaporation in the accretion disk may play a role in the avoidance of several normal outbursts , which does not contradict with the relatively large x - ray luminosity of v844 her . </S>"
