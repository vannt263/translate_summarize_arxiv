    "topological properties of low - dimensional quantum many - body systems have been attracting considerable interest in both quantum information sciences and condensed matter physics .",
    "remarkably , it is understood that important information of the topological phase is encoded in the von neumann entanglement entropy of its ground state.kitaev-preskill,levin-wen,zhang-vishwanath in a seminal paper , li and haldane@xcite proposed that the entanglement spectrum ( es ) labeled by the quantum numbers of symmetries preserved by the schmidt singular - value decomposition contains _ more _ information than the entanglement entropy . in particular , they found the largest eigenvalues of the ground state reduced density matrix mimics the physics edge spectrum of a gapped quantum system , thus revealing the bulk topological order .",
    "a large number of works have followed , suggesting that the  low - energystructure of es reveals the bulk topological order.fidkowski,cirac-2011,bernevig-2011,qi-2012    recently , a critique on this body of work was given by chandran , khemani , and sondhi@xcite , who posed a question,``how universal is the entanglement spectrum ? '' in this paper we will address this important question by studying the es of a family of one - dimensional symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phases.chen-gu-wen-2011,schuch,chen-gu-liu-wen the spt phases have robust gapless edge excitations and can not be continuously connected to trivial product state without either breaking the protecting symmetry or closing the energy gap . moreover",
    ", the one - dimensional spt phases have been generally classified by group cohomologies completely.@xcite es of these phases are sufficiently simple and can be calculated analytically for model wave functions@xcite , thus providing an ideal setting for addressing this issue .",
    "our results demonstrate that es of topological phases include both topological / universal and non - topological parts . in certain cases",
    "the universal part can be isolated , and is extremely useful in revealing the bulk topological order .",
    "the simplest example of spt phases is the haldane gapped phase of the antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain,@xcite which is protected by any one of the following discrete symmetries : time reversal symmetry , link inversion symmetry , or the @xmath6 symmetry comprising @xmath7 rotations about two orthogonal axes.gu-wen-2009,pollmann-oshikawa-2010,pollmann-oshikawa-2012 the fixed point wave functions for these phases are the valence bond solid ( vbs ) states.aklt we show their es contains a topological part , which is universal , and a non - topological or non - universal part .",
    "the topological part can be isolated by a topological disentangler , a non - local unitary transformation .",
    "for the familiar @xmath0 symmetric vbs states with odd - integer spins , their es is given by a single energy level with @xmath8-fold degeneracy .",
    "however , the bulk topological order only gives rise to ( or protects ) a two - fold degeneracy , which is associated with the @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "the remaining @xmath10-fold degeneracy is _ not _ protected by the bulk topological order .",
    "furthermore , for vbs phases with higher symmetry , we can find corresponding high topological degeneracy and associated protecting symmetry via a generalized non - local unitary transformation .",
    "specifically , we find in the @xmath11 symmetric vbs state with spin-@xmath12,@xcite the topological degeneracy are four - fold and the protecting symmetry can be identified as @xmath13 . in general , for the @xmath2 symmetric vbs states with integer spin-@xmath3,tu-2008,tzx , tu-2009,else - bartlett - doherty , quella-2013 the corresponding protecting symmetry is given by @xmath14 , and the topological degeneracy is @xmath5-fold .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetric vbs states with arbitrary integer spin for a periodic spin chain is given by@xcite @xmath15where the schwinger spin - boson representation with a local constraint @xmath16 has been used as@xmath17one can construct an @xmath18 spin invariant model hamiltonians , whose ground states are exactly given by these vbs states.@xcite in the thermodynamic limit , the spin correlation function decays exponentially with a correlation length @xmath19 , implying that the vbs state is a gapped disordered state .    for a finite length chain with open boundary condition ,",
    "the ground state wave function is expressed as @xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be chosen from @xmath23,@xmath24 , representing the eigenvalues of the edge spins of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "there are total @xmath27 degenerate edge states .    as model wave functions of a family of one - dimensional spt phases , the vbs states exhibit the simplest es . to calculate the es for the wave functions @xmath28where @xmath29",
    "after the normalization of all wave functions are carefully considered , the resulting wave function is written as @xmath30where a ratio of the length dependent factors has been used : @xmath31 , and the entanglement energy level is just given by a single level @xmath32 with a degeneracy @xmath33 , which exactly corresponds to the degeneracy of the vbs wave function with one edge spin .",
    "so the degeneracy of each edge spin and the degeneracy of the entanglement level has one - to - one correspondence.@xcite however , a natural question to ask is whether all the degeneracies of the entanglement energy level are topologically protected or not .",
    "eigenvalue ; ( b ) the right edge spin is specified by its @xmath34 eigenvalue.,width=283 ]",
    "in order to characterize the topological features of these vbs states , non - local string order parameters ( sop ) were first proposed for the spin-1 case,@xcite , and then generalized to arbitrary integer spins@xcite : @xmath35where @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the sop is found to be @xmath39which reveals the fundamental difference between vbs states with odd- and even - integer spins .",
    "only vbs states with odd - integer spins represent topologically nontrivial phases .",
    "an alternative and more useful characterization was revealed through a non - local unitary transformationoshikawa-1992,kennedy - tasaki-1992 @xmath40from which the local spin operators are transformed to @xmath41where a string operator in @xmath42 involves all the sites from left edge site up to @xmath43 , while the string operator in @xmath44 involves all the sites from the site @xmath45 up to the right edge site .",
    "these properties will become crucial in studying the _ transformed _ vbs wave function .",
    "meanwhile , the non - local sop becomes to the local spin correlation via this transformation : @xmath46",
    "for the convenience of performing the non - local unitary transformation , the vbs wave functions are expressed in terms of the eigenvalue basis of the left edge spin @xmath25 and the right edge spin in the @xmath47 : @xmath48where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the transformed vbs states are ferromagnetic long - range ordered states with two finite magnetizations @xmath51 and @xmath52 as local order parameters@xcite:@xmath53therefore the non - local transformation with the discrete symmetry @xmath1 plays the role of a topological disentangler , because it turns topological order of the original vbs state into conventional ferromagnetic order .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the edge spins are used to classify the transformed degenerate ground states @xmath54 .",
    "there exist four different classes of long - range ordered ferromagnetic states with the degeneracy @xmath55 each .",
    "these degeneracies of each ferromagnetic ordered state only appear for @xmath56 odd - integer spins and results from the partial polarization of the spins .",
    "the detailed ferromagnetic configurations are summarized in table i.    .the transformed so(3 ) symmetric vbs states with odd - integer spins .",
    "they are ferromagnetic states classified into four groups by the eigenvalues of the edge spins @xmath57 and @xmath58 , each with @xmath10-fold degeneracy . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to consider the es of the transformed vbs state , we cut the spin chain into two parts a and b ( see fig.1b ) . when the edge spin @xmath59 is transformed into the @xmath60 basis ,",
    "the vbs wave function is written as @xmath61where @xmath62and we have expressed the edge spins in the wave function for part a in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath63 basis , and the edge spins in the wave function of part b in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath47 basis .",
    "when the non - local unitary transformation is applied to the vbs wave function , we separate the transformation into three parts @xmath64 , where @xmath65@xmath66 plays the essential role in determining the new es .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 take the eigenvalues of the corresponding edge spins",
    ". then the transformed wave function is written as @xmath69and the total density matrix of @xmath70 is thus obtained . after the normalization factors are properly taken into account , we can trace out the degrees of freedom of the wave function of the part a , and the reduced density matrix is derived as @xmath71 _ { m , m^{\\prime } } = \\sum_{n=0}^{s}\\sum_{m=0}^{s}\\sum_{m^{\\prime } = 0}^{s}\\frac{1% } { s+1}\\frac{c_{s}^{n}}{\\sqrt{c_{s}^{m}c_{s}^{m^{\\prime } } } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ } \\times f\\left ( s , n , m\\right ) f\\left ( s , n , m^{\\prime } \\right ) e^{i\\pi \\left ( \\alpha + n-\\frac{s}{2}\\right ) \\left ( m - m^{\\prime } \\right ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to complete the summations , some further algebra is performed to rewrite the function @xmath72 in terms of the schwinger bosons .",
    "when @xmath73 is even , the phase factor disappears @xmath74 , and the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix is obtained @xmath75 _ { m , m^{\\prime } } = \\frac{\\delta _ { m , m^{\\prime } } } { s+1}.\\ ] ] however , when @xmath73 is odd , there is a phase factor @xmath76 in the summations , and non - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix is given by @xmath75 _ { m , m^{\\prime } } = \\frac{(-1)^{\\alpha",
    "-s/2}}{\\left ( s+1\\right ) } \\delta _ { m+m^{\\prime } , s}.\\]]for the even - integer spins @xmath3 , all the non - diagonal matrix elements are zero because @xmath77 can not be even , and then @xmath78 is a diagonal matrix with the same element @xmath79 .",
    "this implies that the es of the vbs states with even - integer spins remains the _ same _ after the non - local unitary transformation .",
    "thus the degeneracy in es of vbs states with even - integer spins is _ not _ of topological nature , consistent with the absence of the non - local sop found previously and triviality of this phase.@xcite    however , for the odd - integer spins @xmath3 , the above results show that @xmath80 has diagonal elements @xmath79 and skew diagonal elements @xmath81 , so it is a x - form matrix . for any edge configuration , @xmath78 has one eigenvalue @xmath82 , and the entanglement energy level is dramatically changed and given by @xmath83 with @xmath84 fold degeneracy . in the spin-1 case ,",
    "the transformed vbs wave function is a ferromagnetic product state , and the entanglement energy level is non - degenerate__.__@xcite for the @xmath56 odd - integer spins , however , the transformed vbs wave functions are still entangled states , which are spin partially polarized ferromagnetic states with a degeneracy @xmath85 for each class . the es degeneracy of the transformed vbs states depends on the precise form of the resultant ferromagnetic states , and is thus non - topological . the crucial point , however , is that the non - local unitary transformation with the discrete symmetry @xmath9 has lifted the two - fold topological degeneracy , which is shared by all of these odd - integer spin vbs states belonging to the _ same _ topological phase@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the topological degeneracy and the topologically protecting symmetry can be read off from the non - local unitary transformation .",
    "in order to put the above results in a large context , we consider vbs states with larger symmetry groups which represent spt phases with higher symmetry . we start with a topologically _ nontrivial _ vbs state formed in a spin-@xmath87 chain . viewing each spin-@xmath12 as formed by two spin-@xmath88 s , we can construct an @xmath86 symmetric vbs state@xcite .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the @xmath89 states of a spin-@xmath88 can be regarded as the four states of the spinor representation of @xmath86 .",
    "similarly one can also represent the @xmath90 states of spin-@xmath12 as the five - dimensional vector irreducible representation ( ir ) of @xmath86 .",
    "then we can view the vector ir as the symmetric component of the tensor product of two virtual spinor ir s , i.e. , @xmath91the numerals are the dimensions of the @xmath86 ir s .",
    "the tensor product of two @xmath92 s on adjacent sites decomposes into @xmath93comparing eqs .",
    "( [ decom1 ] ) and ( [ decom2 ] ) , we can regard eq .",
    "( decom1 ) as the tensor product of two neighboring virtual spins after their respective partners have form @xmath86 singlet with other virtual spins",
    ". then one can find that @xmath86 singlet @xmath94 and the antisymmetric @xmath95 appear in the decomposition but the symmetric @xmath96 is absent .",
    "therefore , if @xmath97 , the @xmath86 symmetric vbs state where neighboring virtual @xmath98 s pair into @xmath86 singlet will be the ground state .",
    "the operator @xmath99 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath86 generators @xmath100because the physical spin @xmath18 is a subgroup of @xmath86 , each ir of @xmath11 must decompose into an integral number of @xmath18 multiplets .",
    "thus the @xmath101 discussed above must be expressible as the direct sum of @xmath18 ir obtained by decomposing the direct product of two @xmath102 multiplets . since the 14-dimensional ir is symmetric upon the exchange of site indices , it must only contain even - spin @xmath18 multiplets , i.e. @xmath103 .    for an open chain , there exist a free spin-@xmath88 at each end of the chain , leading to 4-fold degeneracy which is topologically protected by a larger symmetry .",
    "the corresponding topological es degeneracy should also be 4-fold . for comparison , in the @xmath0 symmetric vbs states",
    ", topology only protects a half edge spin and 2-fold es degeneracy for odd - integer spins , while there is no protection at all for even - integer spins .",
    "it is straightforward to promote the symmetry of the vbs states and demand that the spin-@xmath3 states on each site transform under the @xmath104-dimensional vector representation of @xmath105 , which can be formed by tensor decomposition of two virtual @xmath5-dimensional spinors.@xcite the main issue here is to identify the topological degeneracy .",
    "since @xmath2 is a rank-@xmath3 algebra , there are @xmath3 mutually commuting cartan generators : @xmath106 .",
    "at each site , the quantum states are classified by the eigenvalues of these cartan generators as @xmath107thus the single - site states are associated with @xmath3 quantum numbers @xmath108 , and they are subjected to the constraint @xmath109the topological feature of these vbs states can be characterized by the following generalized non - local sop @xmath110since the ground state is @xmath2 rotational invariant , the above non - local order parameters should all be equal to each other . to determine the value of these parameters , only @xmath111 needs to be evaluated . in the @xmath112 channel ,",
    "the role of the phase factor in eq .",
    "( eq : sop ) is to correlate the finite spin polarized states in the @xmath113 channel at the two ends of the string .",
    "if nonzero @xmath113 takes the same value at the two ends , then the phase factor is equal to @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",
    "if nonzero @xmath113 takes two different values at the two ends , then the phase factor is equal to @xmath115 .",
    "thus the value of @xmath111 is determined purely by the probability of @xmath116 appearing at the two ends of the string .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the probability of the states @xmath116 appearing at one lattice site is @xmath117 and thus @xmath118 .    in the @xmath2",
    "lie algebra , @xmath119 @xmath120 span an @xmath0 sub - algebra in which @xmath121 plays the role of flipping the quantum number @xmath122 .",
    "this exponential operator can flip the quantum numbers of @xmath122 without disturbing the quantum states in all other channels .",
    "thus the following non - local unitary transformation with @xmath123 discrete symmetry @xmath124can change the spin configuration in the @xmath125 channel into a ferromagnetically ordered one .",
    "furthermore , by performing this non - local transformation successively in all the channels @xmath126 , all the configurations of the ground state will become ferromagnetically ordered .",
    "applying @xmath127 to the _ cartan _ generators , it can be shown that @xmath128substituting this formula to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sop ] ) , we find that @xmath129thus the non - local sop @xmath130 of the cartan generators become the ordinary two - point correlation functions of local operators . under this general non - local unitary transformation with the @xmath131 symmetry",
    ", the topological order of the original vbs states is transformed into conventional ferromagnetic order , just like in the so(3 ) case .",
    "when an open chain system is considered , there appear @xmath5 degenerate edge states at each end of the chain , which are also topologically protected by the discrete symmetry @xmath14 . accordingly the topological degeneracy in the es can be read off as @xmath5-fold .",
    "we thus find that a higher symmetry in the spt phase protects a higher es degeneracy .",
    "we have shown through explicit examples that entanglement spectra of topological ground states contain both universal and non - universal structures .",
    "the topological degeneracy of the lowest entanglement energy level may be lifted or isolated by a generalized non - local unitary transformation or topological disentangler , which is determined by the minimal symmetry protecting the topological phases .",
