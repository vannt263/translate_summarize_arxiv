    "inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins have been little studied by means of raman spectroscopy , although the usefulness of this technique in such systems is now acknowledged .",
    "@xcite cyclodextrins ( cd ) are a family of natural or synthetically modified cyclic molecules , consisting typically of six ( @xmath1-cd ) , seven ( @xmath2-cd ) or eight ( @xmath3-cd ) glucopyranose units . in water ,",
    "they take on the peculiar 3-dimensional structure of a truncated cone , with a slightly soluble outer surface and a hydrophobic central cavity , whose size depends on the number of glucose units of the molecule .",
    "a remarkable property of cd in aqueous solution , is their ability to form host - guest inclusion complexes with a wide variety of organic and inorganic molecules , provided that the guest molecule is less polar than water.@xcite in particular , inclusion complexes of cd with non - polar drugs are a topic of current interest , because these non - covalent complexes increase not only the aqueous solubility of drugs , but also their chemical stability and bioavailability .",
    "such complexes have been usually investigated in aqueous solution by ultra - violet and visible absorption spectroscopy , fluorescence techniques , and nmr spectroscopy , while x - ray and neutron diffraction are typically utilized in the solid state , but the latter techniques ( unlike raman ) require crystalline samples .",
    "the effect of the inclusion process on the guest molecules has also been the subject of some raman studies;@xcite in particular , raman and ft - ir investigations of the interactions between cd and some non - steroidal anti - inflammatory agents ( like diclofenac sodium , @xcite ketoprofen @xcite and amorphous piroxicam @xcite ) , have shown significant changes in the vibrational spectrum of the complexed guest molecules with respect to the free ones .    among the non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ,",

    "@xcite the molecule of imc has been characterized by different spectroscopic techniques , and it has been observed that , in the crystalline state , it exhibits three polymorphic forms ( called @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ) , depending on the sample history.@xcite due to its chemical structure , imc is poorly soluble in water , resulting in high local drug concentrations responsible for ulcerations in the tissues , and this reduces its therapeutic applications . a strategy to affect the solubility and chemical stability of imc in water , which is actually employed in commercial drugs , consists in the preparation of inclusion complexes with cd .        although some models were proposed for the arrangement of the guest molecule into the cavity , @xcite unequivocal conclusions were not reached . moreover , although the vibrational spectra of the various forms of free imc have been widely studied in the literature by ft - ir and raman spectroscopy , @xcite no raman data have been reported on its inclusion complex with cd .    in the present work",

    "moreover , this is also the range where c = o stretching energies are expected , so that combining experiment and simulations , useful information on the geometry of the complex ( for instance , the position of the involved co group ) may be obtained from the features of raman spectrum .",
    "imc contains both a c = o amide group ( atoms n28-c29-o30 in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ) and a c = o carboxylic group ( atoms c17-o18-o19-h20 ) , which are spatially well separated in the molecule .",
    "the comparison among the raman spectra of fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] seems to indicate that , actually , the peak of imc at 1698 @xmath0 corresponds to the amide c = o stretch .",

    ".. @xcite moreover , in the following we shall see that _ ab initio _ quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics computations confirm this conclusion . thus we may focus on the peak at 1698 @xmath0 ( from now on the corresponding frequency will be labelled @xmath25 , while the frequency of the carboxylic group will be labelled @xmath26 ) , and on its changes due to the inclusion process , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ f.5 ] . by comparing the spectrum of free imc ( a ) to those of the complexes formed by hp@xmath2cd ( b ) and @xmath2cd ( c )",
    ", we note a marked broadening of the peak at @xmath25 , as well as a shift from @xmath27 1700 @xmath0 to @xmath28 .",
    "such a large shift for @xmath25 ( @xmath29 @xmath0 ) is rather unusual in the study of the complexation processes where , generally , smaller variations are observed . @xcite    cd complex ( b ) , imc-@xmath2cd complex ( c ) . ]    from the above results one might infer that it is the amide c = o group of imc ( and the neighboring atoms ) to be mainly affected by the inclusion process .",
    "however , in order to understand the precise way in which such atoms are influenced by complexation , other possible effects should be discussed . generally speaking , changes of vibrational frequencies might be due to the presence of the uncomplexed guest in dimeric form .",
    "this is , for example , what happens to the 4-chlorobenzoic acid which , in the crystalline state , may exist also in dimeric form due to intermolecular hydrogen - bonded interactions , and whose raman spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] ( b ) : here , the broad peak at @xmath30 @xmath0 has been assigned to the carboxylic c = o stretch of the dimer , @xcite and thus corresponds to @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "[ f.6 ] we report the spectra of free 4-chlorobenzoic acid ( a ) , of the @xmath31 physical mixture of 4-chlorobenzoic acid-@xmath2cd , respectively ( b ) , and of the @xmath2cd - complexed 4-chlorobenzoic acid ( c ) . in case ( b ) , only 4-chlorobenzoic acid monomers are expected : as a matter of fact , the breakdown of hydrogen bonding patterns of 4-chlorobenzoic dimers is observed in the shift of the c = o stretch from 1628 @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ f.6](a ) ) to higher energy ( @xmath32 @xmath0 ) ( fig .",
    "[ f.6](b ) ) . moreover , the comparison between fig .",

    "the case of the 4-chlorobenzoic acid shows that complexation may affect the raman peaks in at least two ways : ( i ) by breaking the intermolecular bonds , ( ii ) by modifying the strength of the interatomic bonds ( c = o in this case ) . in order to check the possibility that the former effect may affect the complexed form of imc",
    ", we have measured the raman spectrum of a @xmath31 physical mixture of imc-@xmath2cd ( fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] ( d ) ) . in the energy range between @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath0",
    ", this spectrum exhibits the same characteristic peaks as in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] ( a ) , indicating that the shift of the amide c = o stretch , observed in fig .",
    "[ f.5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , is actually related to complexation and not to the cleavage of hydrogen bonding patterns of imc dimers .",
    "similar results have been obtained on the inclusion complex formed by @xmath2cd with imc sodium salt ( fig .",
    "[ f.7 ] ) : also in this case , we clearly observe a broadening and shift to lower energy of the peak at 1675 @xmath0 , which is generally assigned to the amide c = o stretching , when the guest is included in @xmath2cd .",
    "all these results confirm the trend already observed in the vibrational spectra of imc complexes , and further support the hypothesis that the amide c = o of imc is directly involved in the process of complexation with @xmath2cd .    cd complex ( b ) . ]    finally , the vibrational properties of imc-@xmath2cd inclusion complexes have been also investigated in the low - frequency region ( 10 - 100 @xmath0 ) , using a jobin yvon u1000 raman spectrometer with ar - laser excitation at 514.5 nm ; preliminary results seem to evidence , in this spectral region as well , the presence of significant differences , probably due to extended vibrations of the system .",
    "@xcite    actually , there is also a third phenomenon that might induce changes in the experimental spectra , namely the possible change of the solid state of imc due to the complexation . in general , below",
    "its glass transition temperature imc crystallizes in the stable @xmath3-form , whereas at higher temperatures the formation of the metastable @xmath1-form is predominant .",
    "@xcite the polymorphic @xmath1 and @xmath3 forms differ not only in the packing density of the crystals , but also in the unit cell arrangements , @xcite leading to a deep difference in their raman spectra .",
    "@xcite thus , one could argue that the large structural change undergone by the solid state due to complexation , could be related to the observed shift of @xmath25 . in order to investigate this possibility , we performed numeric simulations describing the complexation process between a single molecule of imc and a single molecule of @xmath36 .",
    "we shall see that they reproduce sufficiently well the experimental findings and that structural changes do not need to be taken into account .",
    "focusing only on the energy range described in the experimental section , the main result from the _ ab initio _ computation is that , in the region @xmath37 @xmath0 ( a complete assignment of frequencies for free imc has been attempted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the eigenvector with the largest raman signal involves the largest displacement over the atoms c29-o30 , i.e. it corresponds to the amide c = o stretching .",
    "the value for @xmath25 found from the uhf _ ab initio _ computation ( 1696 @xmath0 ) is rather close to the experimental one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.uhf ] .",
    "furthermore , in the comparison between experimental and computed raman intensities , the signals falling in the region between about @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath0 can probably be assigned to aromatic c = c stretch bond of imc .",
    "the vibrational analysis of complexes has been performed using classical simulation ( see next section ) , which allows larger systems to be simulated with respect to the _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "the advantage of numeric simulations , with respect to the experiments , is that the positions of the imc and cd atoms can be located exactly . on the other hand ,",
    "numeric simulations of the complex are rather cpu - time demanding , especially when the effects of the solvent are taken into account .",
    "the length of our runs ranged from 1 ms , for a molecule of imc in vacuum , to only a few ns when thousands of molecules of water were added . to answer in a reliable way the question about the geometry of the inclusion process",
    ", one should perform long enough runs of many imc and @xmath2cd molecules , in the presence of a solvent , in order to detect many spontaneous inclusion events , and then perform a statistical study . as we shall see , because of the long cpu - time needed , this goal has been only marginally achieved , since only one of such events has been observed . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been possible to gain further physical insight by supporting this result with somewhat less ambitious simulations .",
    "cd complex utilized in cases ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ( see text ) . in the former case , molecules of water have been added . ]    in order to study the inclusion of imc in @xmath2cd we have simulated the following systems : ( 1 ) single imc molecule in vacuum , ( 2 ) single imc molecule in a box of 1114 molecules of water , ( 3 ) single imc-@xmath2cd inclusion complex in vacuum , ( 4 ) single inclusion complex in a box of 633 molecules of water and ( 5 ) 9 imc molecules plus 9 @xmath2cd molecules in a box of 1400 molecules of water . in systems",

    "more precisely , a complex is defined by the fact that @xmath41 ( or , at least , much lesser than the typical distance between free imc and @xmath2cd ) . moreover , starting from the thermodynamic equilibrium configuration , we sought for the minima of the energy potential . in the minimum configurations we computed the eigenvalues @xmath42 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath43 of the dynamical matrix , in order to determine the vibrational properties of the different systems . from such quantities",
    "we have obtained the density of vibrational states @xmath44 and the quantity @xmath45 , which measures the amplitude of the vibration of the @xmath46-th atom due to the mode of frequency @xmath42 .",
    "the thermodynamic parameters chosen for the simulations are room temperature and room pressure , with the coupling to the external bath introduced via a weak coupling scheme .",

    "( [ f.9 ] ) we show the behavior of the distance @xmath40 during different molecular dynamics runs .",

    "after 1 ns , @xmath40 reaches a value of approximately 2 @xmath47 , which we interpret as the signature of an inclusion event , with the cl located quite close to the center of mass of @xmath2cd . in our runs , we did not observe other inclusion processes , thus we are not able to perform a detailed study of the phenomenon ( characteristic times , etc ... ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath40 is much smaller than the position of the first peak of the pair correlation function between _ free _ imc and cd molecules ( horizontal line ) .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath40 reached in the spontaneous inclusion process found in system ( 5 ) is very similar to the stationary value of the distance in the run of system ( 4 ) ( dashed line ) , where the complex was initially created and put in a box of water .",
    "both results support our claim that in system ( 5 ) ( which is the most similar to an experimental sample ) we actually observed a single complexation process .",
