    "the one - dimensional heisenberg spin chain @xcite is among the few many - body quantum systems for which one can compute exactly some physical quantities ( spectrum , correlation functions , ... ) .",
    "this model was solved for the first time in the seminal paper of h. bethe @xcite where he succeeded to map the study of the spectrum to the resolution of transcendental equations , now called bethe equations .",
    "subsequently , the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) has been introduced ( see @xcite and for reviews @xcite ) based on solutions of yang - baxter equation @xcite .",
    "this approach is very fruitful and , for example , provides a whole class of integrable spin chains associated to generic algebras ( yangians or quantum groups based on classical lie algebras or superalgebras ) . focusing on spin chains based on @xmath1 only , one can use the qism approach to define and study e.g. : higher spin chains @xcite , spin chain with impurities @xcite or alternating spin chain @xcite . in these types of chains the spins are no more 1/2 , but can be arbitrary , a situation that is nowadays relevant for condensed matter experiments , where quasi - one - dimensional spin chains with different spins are studied , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to wonder whether a spin chain containing arbitrary spins can be studied through qism approach .",
    "a first and immediate problem in such studies comes from the thermodynamical limit ( when @xmath7 , the number of sites , tends to infinity ) .",
    "such limit is needed for a comparison with physical model , and it is rather obvious that one needs some regularity in the spin content of the chain so as to be able to compute relevant quantities while taking the limit @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath0-regular spin chains ( i.e. spin chains with a repeated motif containing @xmath0 spins in arbitrary representations ) have been introduced @xcite to remedy this objection while keeping enough freedom to encompass most of the known cases .",
    "for instance , homogeneous spin chains ( for any spin @xmath9 ) correspond to @xmath10 , and one recovers the alternating spin chain for @xmath3 .",
    "they also allow to define an integrable model @xcite for spin chains with periodic array of impurities ( while the original ones @xcite were not integrable ) .",
    "@xmath0-regular spin chains have been also studied using qism approach in @xcite .    in the antiferromagnetic regime , these models may be seen as lattice versions of a corresponding integrable relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "this link is very useful since it allows one to compare both models for which numerous exact results are known . from spin chains side , by solving the bethe equations in the thermodynamical limit , it may be possible to compute exactly the scattering matrix between the excitations .",
    "it allows one to obtain indication on the underlying field theory and , then , on the long - distance physics .",
    "this program has been followed for different types of spin chain : heisenberg model @xcite , higher spin chains @xcite and alternating spin @xmath11 chain @xcite . in this paper , we tackle the problem to compute the scattering matrix for the general @xmath0-regular spin chains based on @xmath12 . after recalling some results about their spectrum , we give an interpretation of the excitations in terms of particles and conjecture an explicit form for the scattering matrix .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : not ] , we give the notations used throughout the paper .",
    "then , we recall , in section [ sec : hint ] , well - known results about the integrability of the general spin chains using the transfer matrices constructed from rational solutions of the yang - baxter equation .",
    "we also link these transfer matrices with the shift operator as well as the hamiltonian of the models .",
    "section [ sec : bet ] is devoted to the computation of the bethe equations and their study in the string hypothesis .",
    "the two following sections give some results on the spectrum : the energy of the antiferromagnetic vacuum is given in section [ sec : vac ] and the dispersion law for the first excited states is established in section [ sec : exct ] .",
    "then , we propose , in section [ sec : smat ] , a conjecture for the scattering matrix between these excited states . finally , in section [ sec : conclu ] , we conclude on open problems .",

    "then , to be sure that this method gives all the eigenstates , we must prove that the number of eigenstates obtained by bethe ansatz is equal to the dimension of the starting hilbert space .",
    "let us recall that the bethe eigenvectors are highest weight for the @xmath1 symmetry , so that a bethe eigenvector is @xmath144-degenerated , where @xmath145 is its total spin ( [ eq : sto ] ) .",

    "in addition , the constraint on the type of strings present in the model suggests that the underlying model is not strictly a xxz spin chain but rather an rsos model @xcite ( see @xcite for the analysis ) which is in agreement with the counting of states ( see section [ sec : cou ] ) .",
    "indeed , this general case is very similar to a homogeneous spin @xmath364 chain , as treated in @xcite where the underlying rsos structure has been discovered .",
    "the only difference lies on the first factor of the l.h.s .",
    "of bethe equations ( [ eq : cbe2 ] ) which may be explained by replacing a homogeneous rsos model by a rsos model with @xmath261 sites with a jump @xmath365 then @xmath351 sites with a jump @xmath17 .",
    "this interpretation justifies the choice done at the end of section [ sec : cou ] between the different rsos model that are allowed when one looks only at the number of states .",
    "all the considerations of previous subsections [ sec : sg ] and [ sec : link ] allow us to propose an educated guess for the scattering matrix of the model .",

    "therefore , the spin part of the scattering matrix for the @xmath371 particle of type @xmath158 is similar to the one of the usual homogeneous spin @xmath196 chain @xcite . as usual , in order to write the scattering matrix , we introduce the following transfer matrix @xmath372 where @xmath373 and we have used the r - matrix @xmath374 defined by ( [ eq : rr ] ) .    for the rsos part of the scattering matrix , we use the results of @xcite .",

    "this conjecture allows us to reproduce the scattering matrices obtained by @xcite for the homogeneous spin @xmath9 chain by putting @xmath394 ( then @xmath395 ) , @xmath396 and @xmath397 .",

    "the non trivial part of the s - matrix for the particle of type @xmath256 acts only on @xmath407 the scattering matrix acting on the first space introduced above is very similar to the one computed in the previous section and is related to the transfer matrix ( [ eq : transferrsos ] ) .",
    "for the scattering matrix acting on the second space , as suggested by relation ( [ eq : sc2 ] ) , we must introduce a transfer matrix with a fused auxiliary space using the following boltzmann weights @xmath408 and @xmath409 .",

    "it reproduces also the results of @xcite and , in particular , it shows that the particles of type 1 scatter trivially .    finally , to support this conjecture and the choice of rsos models",
    ", we can look for the central charge of the underlying conformal model computed previously in @xcite @xmath418 we recognize in each term @xmath419 the central charge of a rsos model with the restriction parameter @xmath420 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us remark that for @xmath421 and @xmath422 ( @xmath423 ) , it is possible to solve the bethe equations of section [ sec : link ] and to compute exactly a 2-particle scattering matrix thanks to the results of section [ sec : sg ] . however , the results computed in this way disagree , in general , with the results obtained via the conjectures ( [ eq : con_l0 ] ) or ( [ con_j ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy appeared already in the case of homogeneous spin @xmath9 chain with @xmath380 : the 2-body scattering matrices computed in @xcite are different from the one computed in @xcite ( whereas both results agreed for @xmath381 ) .",
    "this inconsistency has been attributed in @xcite to the non - validity of the string hypothesis ( see also the remark [ rmk : string ] ) . to support this point",
    ", we emphasize that the computation of the central charge has the same feature . indeed",

    "finally , let us remark that this disagreement occurs when the rsos structure becomes non trivial ( i.e. when the rsos space becomes strictly greater than one ) .    for the more general case of @xmath0-regular spin chains treated in this paper , we have assumed , in order to guess the conjectures , that similar discrepancies in the computation of the scattering matrix acting non trivially on @xmath426 take place also in the cases when @xmath427 ( i.e. when the corresponding rsos space becomes non trivial ) and only in these cases .",
    "as for the homogeneous spin chain , this is corroborated by the computation of the central charge inside the string hypothesis and by comparing it with ( [ eq : cc ] ) .",
    "indeed , generalizing the computations done for example in @xcite , we proved that the central charge is equal to @xmath158 inside the string hypothesis .",
    "therefore , to get the value of the central charge given in ( [ eq : cc ] ) , one must add a non - vanishing term to @xmath158 each time @xmath428 .    from the above discussions , it seems as though the computations done in subsections [ sec : sg ] and [ sec : link ] are useless .",
    "nevertheless , let us point out the two following points .",
    "firstly , thanks to the comparison with the homogeneous spin chain results @xcite , they allow us to give an educated guess for the scattering matrices . secondly ,",
    "as argued in @xcite , the scattering matrices obtained inside the string hypothesis ( i.e. the ones of subsections [ sec : sg ] and [ sec : link ] ) may be also the ones of an underlying quantum field theory .",
    "however , this theory would be obtained as a limit when one sends to zero first the temperature then the magnetic field , whereas the theory corresponding to our conjectured scattering matrices would be obtained when one sends to zero first the magnetic field and then the temperature .",
    "for a general @xmath429-regular closed xxx spin chain , we have identified the elementary excitations of the chain .",
    "they consist in spin-1/2 spinons ( associated to the highest spin sites entering the chain ) and scalar particles , whose different types are related to the other different sites in the chain .",
    "then , we have conjectured the general form of the scattering matrix for these elementary excitations .",
    "it makes appear generalized rsos models , and we have given the corresponding boltzmann weights . the first question to address is obviously about the validity of this conjecture .",
    "we have argued about it by computing the central charge of the associated conformal models , but a complete proof is still lacking .",
    "it is also natural to ask whether this approach can be generalized to other algebras or superalgebras .",
    "indeed , a first account on @xmath429-regular spin chains based on @xmath430 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the relevance of such general integrable spin chains in condensed matter physics have been pointed out in e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the calculation of the scattering matrix has been done only for homogeneous spin chain with particular representations @xcite .",
    "a general treatment remains to be done for these models .",
    "this open problem is very promising , since it could be linked to rsos models based on @xmath430 .",
    "the situation is very similar when one considers deformations ( quantum groups ) and/or superalgebras @xmath431 . for",
    "the quantum groups @xmath432 ( and in particular @xmath433 , related to xxz chain ) , the same algebraic approach to construct integrable @xmath0-regular spin chain can be done ( see first accounts in @xcite ) .",
    "the excited states for homogeneous arbitrary spin chain based on @xmath433 and their scattering matrix have been studied in @xcite : they also show internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the general case ( based on @xmath432 ) remains to be done .",
    "for superalgebras , again the super - yangian @xmath434 can be investigated through the same method ( see e.g. @xcite ) and should lead to generalized super - rsos models .",
    "finally , @xmath435 can also be treated in the same way , see for instance @xcite where the nested bethe ansatz is done in a unified way for all these cases ( @xmath436 , @xmath432 , @xmath434 and @xmath435 ) and at the algebraic level .",
    "the computation of the scattering matrices is still an open problem .    for other ( orthogonal , symplectic or exceptional ) algebras or the orthosymplectic superalgebra",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "indeed , the whole construction of ` algebraic spin chains ' ( as introduced in @xcite ) relies on the so - called evaluation morphism between the yangian @xmath436 and the envelopping algebra @xmath437 .",
    "this morphism does not exist for these other classical algebras , so that one needs to work at the level of representations directly .",
    "in fact , the scattering matrices has been computed in few cases ( for example , in @xcite , for the homogeneous @xmath438 spin chain in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "this indicates that a general method based on a different approach should exist , but it is not known up to now .",
    "another question that rises is the case of open spin chains . indeed , in @xcite and @xcite these chains have also been treated , and the nested bethe ansatz for ` algebraic open spin chains ' based on @xmath436 , @xmath432 , @xmath434 and @xmath435 can be found in @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that the procedure can be applied to these cases too .",
    "scattering matrices for models with boundaries when the spins are in the fundamental representation have been computed in @xcite .",
    "finally , let us note that one could use these generalized spin chains to define new integrable t - j models with impurities in the spirit of @xcite , using a jordan - wigner type transformation .",
