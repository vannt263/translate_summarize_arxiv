    "social networks have existed for thousands of years , but it was not until recently that researchers have started to gain scientific insights into phenomena like the _ small world property_. the rise of the internet has enabled people to connect with each other in new ways and to find friends sharing the same interests from all over the planet .",
    "a social network on the internet can manifest itself in various forms .",
    "for instance , on _ facebook _ , people maintain virtual references to their friends .",
    "the contacts stored on mobile phones or email clients form a social network as well .",
    "the analysis of such networks  both their static properties as well as their evolution over time  is an interesting endeavor , as it reveals many aspects of our society in general .",
    "a classic tool to model human behavior is _",
    "game theory_. it has been a fruitful research field in economics and sociology for many years .",
    "recently , computer scientists have started to use game theory methods to shed light onto the complexities of today s highly decentralized networks .",
    "game theoretic models traditionally assume that people act autonomously and are steered by the desire to maximize their benefits ( or utility ) . under this assumption , it is possible to quantify the performance loss of a distributed system compared to situations where all participants collaborate perfectly . a widely studied measure which captures this loss of social welfare is the _ price of anarchy _ ( poa ) .",
    "even though these concepts can lead to important insights in many environments , we believe that in some situations , the underlying assumptions do not reflect reality well enough .",
    "one such example are social networks : most likely people act less selfishly towards their friends than towards complete strangers .",
    "such altruistic behavior is typically not considered in game - theoretic models .    in this article",
    ", we propose a game theoretic framework for social networks .",
    "social networks are not only attractive to their participants , e.g. , it is well - known that the user profiles are an interesting data source for the pr industry to provide tailored advertisements . moreover , social network graphs can also be exploited for attacks , e.g. , email viruses using the users address books for propagating , worms spreading on mobile phone networks and over the internet telephony tool skype have been reported ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this article investigates rational inoculation strategies against such viruses from our game theoretic perspective , and studies the propagation of such viruses on the social network .",
    "this article makes a first step to combine two active threads of research : social networks and game theory .",
    "we introduce a framework taking into consideration that people may care about the well - being of their friends .",
    "in particular , we define the _ windfall of friendship _ ( wof ) which captures to what extent the social welfare improves in social networks compared to purely selfish systems .    in order to demonstrate our framework , as a case study",
    ", we provide a game - theoretic analysis of a _ virus inoculation game_. concretely , we assume that the players have the choice between inoculating by buying anti - virus software and risking infection .",
    "as expected , our analysis reveals that the players in this game always benefit from caring about the other participants in the social network rather than being selfish .",
    "intriguingly , however , we find that the windfall of friendship may not increase monotonically with stronger relationships . despite the phenomenon being an `` ever - green '' in political debates , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first article to quantify this effect formally .",
    "this article derives upper and lower bounds on the windfall of friendship in simple graphs .",
    "for example , we show that the windfall of friendship in a complete graph is at most @xmath0 ; this is tight in the sense that there are problem instances where the situation can indeed improve this much .",
    "moreover , we show that in star graphs , friendship can help to eliminate undesirable equilibria .",
    "generally , we discover that even in simple graphs the windfall of friendship can attain a large spectrum of values , from constant ratios up to @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the network size , which is asymptotically maximal for general graphs .",
    "also an alternative friendship model is discussed in this article where the relative importance of an individual friend declines with a larger number of friends . while the windfall of friendship is still positive ,",
    "we show that the non - monotonicity result is no longer applicable .",
    "moreover , it is proved that in both models , computing the best and the worst friendship nash equilibrium is @xmath3-hard .",
    "the paper also initiates the discussion of implications on convergence .",
    "we give a potential function argument to show convergence of best - response sequences in various models and for simple , cyclic graphs .",
    "moreover , we report on our simulations which indicate that the convergence times are typically higher in social contexts , and hence constitute a certain price of friendship .",
    "finally , to complement our formal analysis of the worst equilibria , simulation results for average case equilibria are discussed .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : relwork ] reviews related work and section  [ sec : model ] formally introduces our model and framework .",
    "the windfall of friendship on general graphs and on special graphs is studied in sections  [ sec : general ] and  [ sec : cliquestar ] respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : relative ] discusses an alternative model where the relative importance of a friend declines if the total number of friends increases .",
    "aspects of best - response convergence and implications are considered in section  [ sec : convergence ] .",
    "we report on simulations in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "finally , we conclude the article in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "social networks are a fascinating topic not only in social sciences , but also in ethnology , and psychology .",
    "the advent of social networks on the internet , e.g. , _ facebook _ , _ linkedin _ , _ myspace _ , _ orkut _ , or _ xing _ , to name but a few , heralded a new kind of social interactions , and the mere scale of online networks and the vast amount of data constitute an unprecedented treasure for scientific studies .",
    "the topological structure of these networks and the dynamics of the user behavior has a mathematical and algorithmic dimension , and has raised the interest of mathematicians and engineers accordingly .    the famous _ small world experiment _",
    "@xcite conducted by stanley milgram 1967 has gained attention by the algorithm community  @xcite and inspired research on topics such as decentralized search algorithms  @xcite , routing on social networks  @xcite and the identification of communities  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of epidemic propagation of information or diseases has been studied from an algorithmic perspective as well  @xcite .",
    "knowledge on effects of this cascading behavior is useful to understand phenomena as diverse as word - of - mouth effects , the diffusion of innovation , the emergence of bubbles in a financial market , or the rise of a political candidate .",
    "it can also help to identify sets of influential players in networks where marketing is particularly efficient ( _ viral marketing _ ) .",
    "for a good overview on economic aspects of social networks , we refer the reader to @xcite , which , i.a . , compares random graph theory with game theoretic models for the formation of social networks .",
    "recently , game theory has also received much attention by computer scientists .",
    "this is partly due to the various actors and stake - holders who influence the decentralized growth of the internet : game theory is a useful tool to gain insights into the internet s socio - economic complexity .",
    "many aspects have been studied from a game - theoretic point of view , e.g. , _ routing _",
    "@xcite , _ multicast transmissions _",
    "@xcite , or _",
    "network creation _ @xcite .",
    "moreover , computer scientists are interested in the algorithmic problems offered by game theory , e.g. , on the existence of pure equilibria  @xcite .",
    "this article applies game theory to social networks where players are not completely selfish and autonomous but have friends about whose well - being they care to some extent .",
    "we demonstrate our mathematical framework with a virus inoculation game on social graphs .",
    "there is a large body of literature on the propagation of viruses  @xcite .",
    "miscellaneous misuse of social networks has been reported , e.g. , _ _",
    "email viruses _ _ have used address lists to propagate to the users friends .",
    "similar vulnerabilities have been exploited to spread worms on the _ mobile phone network _",
    "@xcite and on the internet telephony tool _ _",
    "skype__.    there already exists interesting work on game theoretic and epidemic models of propagation in social networks .",
    "for instance , montanari and saberi  @xcite attend to a game theoretic model for the diffusion of an innovation in a network and characterize the rate of convergence as a function of graph structure .",
    "the authors highlight crucial differences between game theoretic and epidemic models and find that the spread of viruses , new technologies , and new political or social beliefs do not have the same viral behavior .",
    "the articles closest to ours are  @xcite .",
    "our model is inspired by aspnes et al .",
    "the authors apply a classic game - theoretic analysis and show that selfish systems can be very inefficient , as the price of anarchy is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total number of players .",
    "they show that computing the social optimum is @xmath3-hard and give a reduction to the combinatorial problem _ sum - of - squares partition_. they also present a @xmath4 approximation .",
    "moscibroda et al .",
    "@xcite have extended this model by introducing malicious players in the selfish network .",
    "this extension facilitates the estimation of the robustness of a distributed system to malicious attacks .",
    "they also find that in a non - oblivious model , intriguingly , the presence of malicious players may actually _ improve _ the social welfare . in a follow - up work",
    "@xcite which generalizes the social context of  @xcite to arbitrary bilateral relationships , it has been shown that there is no such phenomenon in a simple network creation game .",
    "the _ windfall of malice _ has also been studied in the context of congestion games  @xcite by babaioff et al .",
    "in contrast to these papers , our focus here is on social graphs where players are concerned about their friends benefits .",
    "there is other literature on game theory where players are influenced by their neighbors . in",
    "_ graphical economics _",
    "@xcite , an undirected graph is given where an edge between two players denotes that free trade is allowed between the two parties , where the absence of such an edge denotes an embargo or an other restricted form of direct trade .",
    "the payoff of a player is a function of the actions of the players in its neighborhood only .",
    "in contrast to our work , a different equilibrium concept is used and no social aspects are taken into consideration .",
    "note that the nature of game theory on social networks also differs from _ cooperative games _",
    "( e.g. ,  @xcite ) where each coalition @xmath5 of players @xmath6 has a certain characteristic cost or payoff function @xmath7 describing the collective payoff the players can gain by forming the coalition .",
    "in contrast to cooperative games , the `` coalitions '' are fixed , and a player participates in the `` coalitions '' of all its neighbors .    a preliminary version of this article appeared at acm ec 2008  @xcite , and",
    "there have been several interesting results related to our work since then .",
    "for example ,  @xcite studies auctions with spite and altruism among bidders , and presents explicit characterizations of nash equilibria for first - price auctions with random valuations and arbitrary spite / altruism matrices , and for first and second price auctions with arbitrary valuations and so - called regular social networks ( players have same out - degree ) . by rounding a natural linear program with region - growing techniques ,",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite present a better , @xmath8-approximation for the best vaccination strategy in the original model of  @xcite , where @xmath9 is the support size of the outbreak distribution .",
    "moreover , the effect of autonomy is investigated : a benevolent authority may suggest which players should be vaccinated , and the authors analyze the `` price of opting out '' under partially altruistic behavior ; they show that with positive altruism , nash equilibria may not exist , but that the price of opting out is bounded .",
    "we extend the conference version of this article  @xcite in several respects .",
    "the two most important additions concern _ relative friendship _ and _ convergence_. we study an additional model where the relative importance of a neighbor declines with the total number of friends and find that while friendship is still always beneficial , the non - monotonicity result no longer applies : unlike in the absolute friendship model , the windfall of friendship can only increase with stronger social ties .",
    "in addition , we initiate the study of convergence issues in the social network .",
    "it turns out that it takes longer until an equilibrium is reached compared to purely selfish environments and hence constitutes a price of friendship .",
    "we present a potential function argument to prove convergence in some simple cyclic networks , and complement our study with simulations on kleinberg graphs .",
    "we believe that the existence of and convergence to social equilibria are exciting questions for future research ( see also the related fields of _ player - specific utilities _",
    "@xcite and _ local search complexity _",
    "@xcite ) . finally , there are several minor changes , e.g. , we improve the bound in theorem  [ thm : monotone ] from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "this section introduces our framework . in order to gain insights into the windfall of friendship",
    ", we study a virus inoculation game on a social graph .",
    "we present the model of this game and we show how it can be extended to incorporate social aspects .",
    "the virus inoculation game was introduced by  @xcite .",
    "we are given an undirected network graph @xmath12 of @xmath13 players ( or nodes ) @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , who are connected by a set of edges ( or _ links _ ) @xmath16 .",
    "every player has to decide whether it wants to _ inoculate _",
    "( e.g. , purchase and install anti - virus software ) which costs @xmath17 , or whether it prefers saving money and facing the risk of being infected .",
    "we assume that being infected yields a damage cost of @xmath18 ( e.g. , a computer is out of work for @xmath18 days ) . in other words , an instance @xmath19 of a game",
    "consists of a graph @xmath12 , the inoculation cost @xmath17 and a damage cost @xmath18 .",
    "we introduce a variable @xmath20 for every player @xmath21 denoting @xmath21 s chosen _",
    "strategy_. namely , @xmath22 describes that player @xmath21 is protected whereas for a player @xmath23 willing to take the risk , @xmath24 . in the following",
    ", we will assume that @xmath25 , that is , we do not allow players to _ mix _ ( i.e. , use probabilistic distributions over ) their strategies .",
    "these choices are summarized by the _ strategy profile _ , the vector @xmath26 .",
    "after the players have made their decisions , a virus spreads in the network .",
    "the propagation model is as follows .",
    "first , one player @xmath27 of the network is chosen uniformly at random as a starting point .",
    "if this player is inoculated , there is no damage and the process terminates .",
    "otherwise , the virus infects @xmath27 and all unprotected neighbors of @xmath27 .",
    "the virus now propagates recursively to their unprotected neighbors .",
    "hence , the more insecure players are connected , the more likely they are to be infected .",
    "the vulnerable region ( set of players ) in which an insecure player @xmath21 lies is referred to as @xmath21 s _ attack component_. we only consider a limited region of the parameter space to avoid trivial cases .",
    "if the cost @xmath17 is too large , no player will inoculate , resulting in a totally insecure network and therefore all players eventually will be infected . on the other hand , if @xmath28 , the best strategy for all players is to inoculate .",
    "thus , we will assume that @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the following .    in our game , a player has the following expected cost :    [ actualcost]@xmath31 the _ actual individual cost _ of a player @xmath21 is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the size of @xmath21 s attack component .",
    "if @xmath21 is inoculated , @xmath33 stands for the size of the attack component that would result if @xmath21 became insecure . in the following ,",
    "let @xmath34 refer to the actual cost of an insecure and @xmath35 to the actual cost of a secure player @xmath21 .",
    "the total _ social cost _ of a game is defined as the sum of the cost of all participants : @xmath36 .",
    "classic game theory assumes that all players act selfishly , i.e. , each player seeks to minimize its individual cost . in order to study the impact of such selfish behavior , the solution concept of a _",
    "nash equilibrium _ ( ne ) is used .",
    "a nash equilibrium is a strategy profile where no selfish player can unilaterally reduce its individual cost given the strategy choices of the other players",
    ". we can think of nash equilibria as the stable strategy profiles of games with selfish players .",
    "we will only consider pure nash equilibria in this article , i.e. , players can not use random distributions over their strategies but must decide whether they want to inoculate or not .    in a pure nash equilibrium",
    ", it must hold for each player @xmath21 that given a strategy profile @xmath37 @xmath38 , implying that player @xmath21 can not decrease its cost by choosing an alternative strategy @xmath39 . in order to quantify the performance loss due to selfishness , the ( not necessarily unique ) nash equilibria",
    "are compared to the optimum situation where all players collaborate . to this end",
    "we consider the _ price of anarchy _",
    "( poa ) , i.e. , the ratio of the social cost of the worst nash equilibrium divided by the optimal social cost for a problem instance @xmath19 .",
    "more formally , @xmath40      our model for social networks is as follows .",
    "we define a _ friendship factor _",
    "@xmath41 which captures the extent to which players care about their _ friends _ ,",
    "i.e. , about the players _ adjacent _ to them in the social network .",
    "more formally , @xmath41 is the factor by which a player @xmath21 takes the individual cost of its neighbors into account when deciding for a strategy .",
    "@xmath41 can assume any value between 0 and 1 .",
    "@xmath42 implies that the players do not consider their neighbors cost at all , whereas @xmath43 implies that a player values the well - being of its neighbors to the same extent as its own .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the set of neighbors of a player @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath45 be the set of inoculated neighbors , and @xmath46 the remaining insecure neighbors .",
    "we distinguish between a player s _ actual cost _ and a player s _ perceived cost_. a player s actual individual cost is the expected cost arising for each player defined in definition  [ actualcost ] used to compute a game s social cost . in our social network ,",
    "the decisions of our players are steered by the players _ perceived cost_.    [ perceived cost]@xmath31 the _ perceived individual cost _ of a player @xmath21 is defined as @xmath47 in the following , we write @xmath48 to denote the perceived cost of an insecure player @xmath21 and @xmath49 for the perceived cost of an inoculated player .",
    "this definition entails a new notion of equilibrium .",
    "we define a _ friendship nash equilibrium _",
    "( fne ) as a strategy profile @xmath37 where no player can reduce its _",
    "cost by unilaterally changing its strategy given the strategies of the other players .",
    "formally , @xmath50 given this equilibrium concept , we define the _ windfall of friendship _ @xmath51 .    [",

    "greater _ in social graphs than in purely selfish environments .",
    "in this section we characterize friendship nash equilibria and derive general results on the windfall of friendship for the virus propagation game in social networks . it has been shown  @xcite that in classic nash equilibria ( @xmath42 )",
    ", an attack component can never consist of more than @xmath56 insecure players .",
    "a similar characteristic also holds for friendship nash equilibria . as every player cares about its neighbors , the maximal attack component size in which an insecure player @xmath21 still does not inoculate depends on the number of @xmath21 s insecure neighbors and the size of their attack components .",
    "therefore , it differs from player to player .",
    "we have the following helper lemma .",
    "[ lemma : ac - size ] the player @xmath21 will inoculate if and only if the size of its attack component is @xmath57 where the @xmath58s are the attack component sizes of @xmath21 s insecure neighbors assuming @xmath21 is secure .",
    "player @xmath21 will inoculate if and only if this choice lowers the perceived cost . by definition  [ perceived cost ] ,",
    "the perceived individual cost of an inoculated player is @xmath59 and for an insecure player we have @xmath60 for @xmath21 to prefer to inoculate it must hold that @xmath61 for all instances of the virus inoculation game and @xmath62 , it holds that @xmath63    the proof idea for @xmath64 is the following : for an instance @xmath19 we consider an arbitrary fne with @xmath65 . given this equilibrium ,",
    "we show the existence of a ne with larger social cost ( according to  @xcite , our best response strategy always converges ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be any ( e.g. , the worst ) fne in the social model .",
    "if @xmath37 is also a ne in the same instance with @xmath42 then we are done .",
    "otherwise there is at least one player @xmath21 that prefers to change its strategy .",
    "assume @xmath21 is insecure but favors inoculation .",
    "therefore @xmath21 s attack component has on the one hand to be of size at least @xmath66  @xcite and on the other hand of size at most @xmath67 ( cf lemma  [ lemma : ac - size ] ) .",
    "this is impossible and yields a contradiction to the assumption that in the selfish network , an additional player wants to inoculate .",
    "it remains to study the case where @xmath21 is secure in the fne but prefers to be insecure in the ne .",
    "observe that , since every player has the same preference on the attack component s size when @xmath42 , a newly insecure player can not trigger other players to inoculate .",
    "furthermore , only the players inside @xmath21 s attack component are affected by this change .",
    "the total cost of this attack component increases by at least @xmath68    applying lemma  [ lemma : ac - size ] guarantees that @xmath69 this results in @xmath70 since a player only gives up its protection if @xmath71 .",
    "if more players are unhappy with their situation and become vulnerable , the cost for the ne increases further . in conclusion , there exists a ne for every fne with @xmath72 for the same instance which is at least as expensive .",
    "the upper bound for the wof , i.e. , @xmath73 , follows directly from the definitions : while the poa is the ratio of the ne s social cost divided by the social optimum , @xmath52 is the ratio between the cost of the ne and the fne . as the fne s cost must be at least as large as the social optimum cost the claim follows .",
    "note that aspnes et al .",
    "@xcite proved that the price of anarchy never exceeds the size of the network , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , the windfall of friendship can not be larger than @xmath2 due to theorem 4.2 .",
    "the above result leads to the question of whether the windfall of friendship grows monotonically with stronger social ties , i.e. , with larger friendship factors @xmath41 .",
    "intriguingly , this is not the case .",
    "[ thm : monotone ] for all networks with more than three players , there exist game instances where @xmath52 does not grow monotonically in @xmath41 .",

    ", at least two leaf players will remain insecure , which will trigger the center player to inoculate , yielding a fne , @xmath81 , where only the center player is secure .",
    "consider @xmath80 first .",
    "let @xmath82 be the insecure center player , let @xmath83 be the insecure leaf player , and let @xmath84 be a secure leaf player .",
    "in order for @xmath80 to constitute a nash equilibrium , the following conditions must hold : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87    for @xmath81 , let @xmath82 be the insecure center player , let @xmath83 be one of the two insecure leaf players , and let @xmath84 be a secure leaf player . in order for the leaf players to be happy with their situation but for the center player to prefer to inoculate , it must hold that : @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90    now choose @xmath91 ( note that due to our assumption that @xmath11 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "this yields the following conditions : @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "these conditions are easily fulfilled , e.g. , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "observe that the social cost of the first fne ( for @xmath77 ) is @xmath98 , whereas for the second fne ( for @xmath78 ) @xmath99 .",
    "thus , @xmath100 as we have chosen @xmath101 and as , due to our assumption , @xmath11 .",
    "this concludes the proof .",

    "note that verifying whether a proposed solution is correct can be done in polynomial time , hence the problems are indeed in @xmath3 .",
    "fix some graph @xmath12 and set @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we show that the following two conditions are necessary and sufficient for a fne : ( a ) all neighbors of an insecure player are secure , and ( b ) every inoculated player has at least one insecure neighbor . due to our assumption that @xmath106 , condition ( b ) is satisfied in all fne . to see that condition ( a ) holds as well , assume the contrary , i.e. , an attack component of size at least two .",
    "an insecure player @xmath21 in this attack component bears the cost @xmath107 . changing its strategy",
    "reduces its cost by at least @xmath108 . by our assumption that @xmath109 , and hence @xmath110 , it holds that @xmath111 , resulting in @xmath21 becoming secure .",
    "hence , condition ( a ) holds in any fne as well . for the opposite direction assume that an insecure player wants to change its strategy even though ( a ) and ( b ) are true",
    "this is impossible because in this case ( b ) would be violated because this player does not have any insecure neighbors .",
    "an inoculated player would destroy ( a ) by adopting another strategy .",
    "thus ( a ) and ( b ) are sufficient for a fne .",
    "we now argue that @xmath112 has a vertex cover of size @xmath103 if and only if the virus game has a fne with @xmath103 or fewer secure players , or equivalently an equilibrium with social cost at most @xmath113 , as each insecure player must be in a component of size 1 and contributes exactly @xmath114 expected cost . given a minimal vertex cover @xmath115 , observe that installing the software on all players in @xmath116 satisfies condition ( a ) because @xmath116 is a vertex cover and ( b ) because @xmath116 is minimal .",
    "conversely , if @xmath116 is the set of secure players in a fne , then @xmath116 is a vertex cover by condition ( a ) which is minimal by condition ( b ) .    for the worst fne , we consider an instance of the independent dominating set problem .",
    "given an independent dominating set @xmath116 , installing the software on all players except the players in @xmath116 satisfies condition ( a ) because @xmath116 is independent and ( b ) because @xmath116 is a dominating set .",

    "however , one could imagine scenarios where the relative importance of a friend decreases with the total number of friends , that is , a player with many friends may care less about the welfare of a specific friend compared to a player who only has one or two friends .",
    "this motivates an alternative approach to describe perceived costs :    [ rel_perceived cost]@xmath31 the _ relative perceived individual cost _ of a player @xmath21 is defined as @xmath190 in the following , we write @xmath191 to denote the relative perceived cost of an insecure player @xmath21 and @xmath192 for the relative perceived cost of an inoculated player",

    "rfne_.    it turns out that while relative equilibria have similar properties as regular friendship equilibria and most of our techniques are still applicable , there are some crucial differences .",

    "again , the upper bound for the wof , i.e. , @xmath73 , follows directly from the definitions ( see also proof of lemma  [ ffneversmaller1 ] ) . for @xmath64",
    "we start from a rfne @xmath37 ( defined with relative costs ) with @xmath65 and show that a best response execution yields a nash equilibrium @xmath197 with cost @xmath198 . if @xmath37 is also a ne in the same instance with @xmath42 then we are done .",
    "otherwise there is at least one player @xmath21 that prefers to change its strategy .",
    "if @xmath21 is insecure but favors inoculation , @xmath21 s attack component has on the one hand to be of size at least @xmath199  @xcite ( otherwise there is not reason for @xmath21 to become secure ) and on the other hand of size at most @xmath200 so @xmath201 ) , yielding a contradiction .",
    "what if @xmath21 is secure in the rfne but prefers to be insecure in the ne ?",
    "since every player has the same preference on the attack component s size when @xmath42 , a newly insecure player can not trigger other players to inoculate .",
    "furthermore , only the players inside @xmath21 s attack component are affected by this change .",
    "the total cost of this attack component increases by at least ( see also the proof of lemma  [ ffneversmaller1 ] ) @xmath202 applying lemma  [ lemma : ac - size - rel ] guarantees that @xmath203 this results in @xmath204 since a player only gives up its protection if @xmath71 .",
    "if more players are unhappy with their situation and become vulnerable , the cost for the ne increases further . in conclusion , there exists a ne for every fne with @xmath72 for the same instance which is at least as expensive .",
    "interestingly , however , the phenomenon of a non - monotonic welfare increase with larger @xmath41 does no longer hold in the star graph @xmath75 . to see this , note that there are only at most two distinct rfne in @xmath75 ( apart from the trivial situations where all players are either insecure or secure ) : the `` good equilibrium '' where the center player is secure and all the leave players insecure , and the `` bad equilibrium '' where the center is insecure and a fraction of the leaves secure .",
    "the following theorem shows that the example of theorem  [ thm : monotone ] for fne is no longer true for rfne .",
    "[ thm : rel - monotone ] the windfall of friendship is monotonic in @xmath41 for @xmath75 under the relative cost model .    consider a friendship factor @xmath41 .",
    "clearly , the equilibrium where only the center player is secure always exists ( w.l.o.g . , we focus on `` reasonable values '' @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . when is there an equilibrium where the center is insecure ?",
    "consider such an equilibrium where @xmath205 leave players are insecure . in order for this to constitute an equilibrium",
    ", it must hold for the center player that :    @xmath206 @xmath207    on the other hand , for an insecure leaf player we have : @xmath208 @xmath209 unlike in the fne scenario , the center player is less likely to inoculate , i.e. , leaf players inoculate first .",
    "thus , a larger @xmath41 can only render the existence of such an equilibrium more unlikely .",
    "finally , note that the hardness result of theorem  [ np - completeness ] is also applicable to relative fnes .",
    "[ rnp - completeness ] computing the best and the worst pure rfne is @xmath3-complete for any @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "( _ sketch _ ) again , deciding the existence of a rfne with cost less than @xmath103 or more than @xmath103 is at least as hard as solving the _ vertex cover _ or _ independent dominating set _",
    "problem , respectively . note that verifying whether a proposed solution is correct can be done in polynomial time , hence the problems are indeed in @xmath3 .",
    "the proof is similar to theorem  [ np - completeness ] , and we only point out the difference for condition ( a ) : an insecure player @xmath21 in the attack component bears the cost @xmath210 , and changing its strategy reduces the cost by at least latexmath:[$\\delta_{i } = k_il / n+ f",

    "according to lemma  [ ffneversmaller1 ] and lemma  [ ffneversmaller1relative ] , the social context can only improve the overall welfare of the players , both in the absolute and the relative friendship model . however , there are implications beyond the players welfare in the equilibria : in social networks , the dynamics of how the equilibria are reached is different .    in  @xcite ,",
    "aspnes et al .  have shown that best - response behavior quickly leads to some pure nash equilibrium , from any initial situation .",
    "their potential function argument however relies on a `` symmetry '' of the players in the sense insecure players in the same attack component have the same cost .",
    "this no longer holds in the social context where different players take into account their neighborhood : a player with four insecure neighbors is more likely to inoculate than a player with just one , secure neighbor .",
    "thus , the distinction between `` big '' and `` small '' components used in  @xcite can not be applied , as different players require a different threshold .",
    "nevertheless , convergence can be shown in certain scenarios .",
    "for example , the hardness proofs of lemmas  [ np - completeness ] and  [ rnp - completeness ] imply that equilibria always exist in the corresponding areas of the parameter space , and it is easy to see that the equilibria are also reached by best - response sequences .",
    "similarly , in the star and complete networks , best - response sequences converge in linear time .",
    "linear convergence time also happens in more complex , cyclic graphs .",
    "for example , consider the cycle graph @xmath214 where each player is connected to one left and one right neighbor in a circular fashion .",
    "to prove best response convergence from arbitrary initial states , we distinguish between an initial phase where certain structural invariants are established , and a second phase where a potential function argument can be applied with respect to the view of only one type of players . each event when one player is given the chance to perform a best response is called a _ round_.    [ thm : cycconv ] from any initial state and in the cycle graph @xmath214 , a best response round - robin sequence results in an equilibrium after @xmath215 changes , both in case of absolute and relative friendship equilibria .",
    "after two round - robin phases where each player is given the chance to make a best response twice ( at most @xmath216 changes or rounds ) , it holds that an insecure player @xmath217 which is adjacent to a secure player @xmath218 can not become secure : since @xmath217 preferred to be insecure at some time @xmath219 , the only reason to become secure again is the event that a player @xmath220 becomes insecure in @xmath217 s attack component at time @xmath221 ; however , since @xmath217 has a secure neighbor @xmath218 and hence @xmath220 can only have more insecure neighbors than @xmath217 , @xmath220 can not prefer a larger attack component than @xmath217 , which yields a contradiction to the assumption that @xmath217 becomes secure while its neighbor @xmath218 is still secure .",
    "moreover , by the same arguments , there can not be three consecutive secure players .",
    "therefore , in the best response rounds after the two initial phases , there are the following cases .",
    "case  ( a ) : a secure player having two insecure neighbors becomes insecure ; case  ( b ) : a secure player with one secure neighbor becomes insecure ; and case  ( c ) : an insecure player with two insecure neighbors becomes secure .    in order to prove convergence , the following potential function @xmath222 is used : @xmath223 where the attack components @xmath224 in @xmath225 contain more than @xmath226 players and the attack components @xmath224 in @xmath227 contain at most @xmath219 players in case of absolute friendship equilibria ; for relative friendship equilibria we use @xmath228 .",
    "in other words , the threshold @xmath219 to distinguish between small and big components is chosen with respect to players having _ two insecure neighbors _ ; in case of absolute fnes : @xmath229 and in case of relative fnes : @xmath230    note that it holds that @xmath231 .",
    "we now show that case  ( a ) and  ( c ) reduce @xmath232 by at least one unit in each best response . moreover , case  ( b ) can increase the potential by at most one .",
    "however , since we have shown that case  ( b ) incurs less than @xmath2 times , the claim follows by an amortization argument .",
    "_ case  ( a ) : _ in this case , a new insecure player @xmath217 is added to an attack component in @xmath227 .",
    "_ case  ( b ) : _ a new insecure player @xmath217 is added to an attack component in @xmath227 or to an attack component in @xmath225 ( since @xmath217 is `` on the edge '' of the attack component , it prefers a larger attack component ) . _",
    "case  ( c ) : _ an insecure player is removed from an attack component in @xmath225 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : cycconv ] can be adapted to show linear convergence in general 2-degree networks where players have degree at most two . in order to gain deeper insights into the convergence behavior",
    ", we conducted several experiments .",
    "this section briefly reports on the simulations conducted on kleinberg graphs ( using clustering exponent @xmath233 ) .",
    "although the existence of equilibria and the best - response convergence time complexity for general graphs remain an open question , during the thousands of experiments , we did not encounter a single instance which did not converge .",
    "moreover , our experiments indicate that the initial configuration ( i.e. , the set of secure and insecure players ) as well as the relationship of @xmath18 to @xmath17 typically has a negligible effect on the convergence time , and hence , unless stated otherwise , the following experiments assume an initially completely insecure network and @xmath104 and @xmath234 .",
    "all experiments are repeated 100 times over different kleinberg graphs .",
    "all our experiments showed a positive windfall of friendship that increases monotonically in @xmath41 , both for the relative and the absolute friendship model .",
    "figure  [ fig : socialcost ] shows a typical result . maybe surprisingly , it turns out that the windfall of friendship is often not due to a higher fraction of secure players , but rather the fact that the secure players are located at strategically more beneficial locations ( see also figure  [ fig : numsec ] ) .",
    "we can conclude that there is a windfall of friendship not only for the worst but also for `` average equilibria '' .",
    "[ ht ]     +    [ ht ]     +    the box plots in figure  [ fig : boxplotcost ] give a more detailed picture of the cost for @xmath235 .",

    "figure  [ fig : convf ] shows the typical convergence times as a function of @xmath41 .",

    "moreover , interestingly , we find that the windfall of friendship does not always increase monotonically with stronger social ties .",
    "we believe that our work opens interesting directions for future research . we have focused on a virus inoculation game , and additional insights",
    "must be gained by studying alternative and more general games such as potential games , or games that do and do not exhibit a braess paradox .",

    "one intuitive takeaway of our work is that in case of large benefits of social behavior , it may make sense to design distributed systems where neighboring players have good relationships .",
