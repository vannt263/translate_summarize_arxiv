    "a new bottom baryon @xmath5 has been observed by the cms collaboration  @xcite , and two new bottom baryon resonances @xmath6 and @xmath7 have been announced by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new proposal was submitted to japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) to measure the production of charmed hadrons .",

    "the @xmath8 reaction was suggested as the first experiment and the relevant theoretical works have been discussed recently by us in collaboration with other authors  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite estimated the production rates of charmed baryons @xmath9 in the process @xmath10 , where @xmath9 is the @xmath11 and their excited states , with the help of quark - diquark model .",

    "we extend the previous investigation  @xcite to the reaction @xmath14 together with the @xmath15 using a similar method .",
    "we first concentrate on the @xmath15 where experimental data exist , so that we are able to fix the parameters such as coupling constants and scale factors .",
    "since the amplitudes have exactly the same strtucture , the corresponding charm production @xmath16 can be easily studied , the parameters being assumed to be the same as the strangeness case .",
    "we also examine the sensitivity of the results to the changes of the parameters .",
    "to fix the regge parameters such as regge trajectories and energy scale parameters , we use the non - perturbative quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) developed by kaidalov et al .",

    "we find that the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) production is governed by vector - meson @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) reggeon exchange at forward angles , whereas by baryon @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) reggeon exchange at backward angles .",

    "the last section is devoted to the summary and conclusion .",
    "we start with explaining a hybridized regge model combining with an effective lagrangian method . in general , there are two different diagrams for both the reactions @xmath16 and @xmath23 as drawn in fig .",
