    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite rather nicely explains the hierarchy problem .",
    "the metric for the rs model compactified on @xmath2 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the minkowski flat metric , @xmath5 and @xmath6 $ ] is the warped extra dimension .",
    "the rs warp factor is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the scale of curvature and @xmath9 is the radius of compactification . in order to ensure that the tev brane is scaled to about a tev from the ir ( or planck ) brane , @xmath10 , these issues ( as well as many others ) are throughly discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "allowing fermions to live in the ads bulk reduces the fermion mass hierarchy problem to a simple geography problem @xcite .",
    "the mass of the fermion depends on its coupling to the higgs ( which resides on the tev brane ) which is determined by the fermion s position in the bulk .",
    "fermions far away from the tev brane couple weakly with the higgs and are thus less massive , while fermions residing close to the tev brane couple strongly to the higgs and , thus , are more massive .",
    "recently the rs model has been extended to add an extra flat dimension @xcite .",
    "we explore the consequences of adding a fourth generation to this six dimensional model .    a fourth generation of fermions has been considered off and on for many years @xcite .",
    "although a fourth generation and warped extra dimensions have been studied @xcite , in this paper we consider a fourth generation and warped extra dimension with an additional flat dimension .",
    "a recent extension @xcite of the randall - sundrum model @xcite , adds an extra flat dimension  this model is named rs6 for convenience .",
    "reference @xcite considers the extra dimension compactified on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , however we will consider only the @xmath11 compactification case .",
    "the @xmath12 case is closely related , the coupling constant @xmath13 simply increases by a factor of @xmath14 .    in this 6 dimensional space , we have the regular 4 dimensions , the warped dimension @xmath15 , and a sixth dimension @xmath16 .",
    "the metric for this model is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the typical rs warp function , @xmath8 is the scale of curvature , @xmath9 is the radius of compactification of the @xmath19 slice , and @xmath6 $ ] and is @xmath20 orbifolded . as usual , @xmath10 . finally , @xmath21 is the radius of @xmath11 and @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 .",
    "the gravitational sector of this model has already been studied @xcite .",
    "davoudiasl and rizzo @xcite explored the gauge bosons in rs6 and compared the results with the original rs model .",
    "we expand on this model by adding a fourth generation of fermions .",
    "we first introduce a sequential fourth generation ; in this paper we will focus on charged heavy leptons .",
    "these effects will will not have any noticeable impact on the fourth generation quarks because of the large tree level diagrams .",
    "the @xmath24 value describes where in the warped dimension the fermion is located .",
    "as the fermion position moves closer to the tev brane ( where the higgs is located ) , @xmath24 approaches negative infinity . because the heavy lepton mass is greater than @xmath25 gev , it will be closer to the tev brane than the bottom quark  almost as close as the right - handed top quark .",
    "this allows us to use the useful approximations to the fermion wavefunctions and coupling constants .",
    "notice the coupling constants @xmath13 of the kk gauge bosons and sm fermions in rs6 @xcite is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bulk profile of the fermions @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the kk gauge boson wavefunction @xmath30 which is normalized by @xmath31 \\right |_{\\phi=0}^{\\phi=\\pi } } \\ ] ] ( note that the normalization is corrected from reference @xcite which contained a typographical error in the paper , but still agrees with the results and figures , this correction corresponds to another typographical error in reference @xcite and allows us to reproduce the graphs of @xmath13 ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the @xmath34 root of @xmath35    figure [ fig.gnlc ] also indicates an increasingly large dependence on higher @xmath36 bosons as @xmath24 decreases  which is equivalent to the mass increasing .",
    "interestingly , for the @xmath37 excitations , the coupling constant @xmath38 increase as @xmath39 increases .",
    "this is opposite to what we expected and only occurs the @xmath37 values , not for higher @xmath40 values .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig.gnlc ] the @xmath37 kk @xmath0 bosons couple much more strongly than larger @xmath40 kk modes .",
    "so the most impact in the cross section will come from the various @xmath41 kk @xmath0 bosons instead of higher @xmath40 models .",
    "thus we will focus on the strongly coupled @xmath42 bosons .",
    "we consider @xmath43 pair production via gluon fusion through a quark loop to a higgs , z boson , or @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "[ fig.ggfusion ] .",
    "we assumed the higg s mass to be @xmath45 gev .",
    "although , @xmath46 was held fixed at @xmath47 , @xmath48 was varied from one to three .",
    "we also chose the mass of @xmath49 to be 2 tev as davoudiasl and rizzo @xcite did ( so we could compare our results more easily ) .",
    "we used feynarts and formcalc @xcite to generate the matrix element along with looptools , form , and lhapdf @xcite to complete the momentum integrals .",
    "remember that the @xmath37 modes dominate over higher @xmath40 modes . as @xmath39 increases the @xmath50 contribution decreases , but not as quickly as we expected .",
    "this means that more modes need to be considered to have an accurate understanding of the cross - section .",
    "the ratio of the process including the @xmath44 contributions to the standard model @xmath0-boson and higgs over just the standard model processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.hz500 ] .    however , as @xmath48 increases the contribution of the higher @xmath44 modes to the cross - section also increases .",
    "this is because the masses of the @xmath44 bosons become closer together .    of particular interest",
    "are the decay modes of the @xmath51 .",
    "if it is similar to its lighter cousins , the muon and the tau , then we expect to see a large decay mode @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are a sm lepton and its associated anti - neutrino .",
    "if the lepton comes from a @xmath1 , then the neutrino is determined and the signature should be relatively straightforward to detect .",
    "the recent rs6 model with an added fourth generation has a clear @xmath55 signature .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath0 boson excitations in the flat dimension ( larger @xmath39 ) contribute more to the cross section than the higher @xmath0 excitations in the warped dimension ( larger @xmath40 ) .",
