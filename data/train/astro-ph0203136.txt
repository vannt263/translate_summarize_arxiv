    "the r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are hydrogen - deficient supergiants , characterized by spectacular drops in visual brightness which occur at random intervals .",
    "rcb stars are a very rare phenomenon with only about 35 known in the galaxy .",
    "the atmospheres of these stars are composed mostly of helium with carbon and nitrogen enrichment .",
    "their hydrogen depletion varies between undetectable hydrogen to severely depleted ( 5% by mass ) .",
    "the declines in brightness are caused by the formation of clouds of carbon dust in front of the star ( see clayton 1996 for a review ) .    to explain the existence of rcb stars , two scenarios have been proposed . in the first scenario",
    "the rcb star is a merger of two white dwarfs ( wd ; iben , tutukov & yungelson 1996 ; saio & jeffery 2000,2002 ) , while in the second scenario a he - shell flash ( thermal pulse ) in a pre - wd inflates the remaining small envelope , leading to a born - again agb evolution . during this",
    "evolution various mixing and nuclear burning processes can cause dramatic changes of the surface abundances ( iben et al .",
    "however , no post - agb stellar evolution model can account for the predominance of helium in the atmospheres of most rcb stars ( herwig 1999,2000 ; pandey et al .",
    "therefore , the wd - merger scenario might be better at explaining the rcb class .",
    "unfortunately , this theoretical scenario has not been worked out in detail yet and skepticism is fueled , for example , by the long merging times of wd in binary systems ( iben et al .",
    "some other classes of hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars show rcb - like light variations due to dust obscuration .",
    "the born - again scenario is known to produce stars with the _ spectral and variability characteristics of rcb stars _ , which is why it was at first postulated that all rcb stars might be created this way . in this class ,",
    "we find sakurai s object ( duerbeck & benetti 1996 ) , v605 aql ( clayton & de marco 1997 ) and fg sge ( gonzalez et al . 1998 ) , all of which were witnessed to undergo a born - again event and develop rcb spectral and light - curve characteristics .",
    "these stars , therefore , create a strong link between the rcb and the born - again classes .    a second class of stars ,",
    "observationally linked to the rcb stars , is the wolf - rayet central stars of planetary nebula ( pn ) .",
    "stars after van der hucht et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , to distinguish them from massive wolf - rayet stars , or [ wc ] stars to emphasize that they are wolf - rayet star of the carbon , rather than nitrogen sequence .",
    "] the link is established by two objects : the [ wc10 ] central star cpd56@xmath4  8032 ( de marco , barlow & storey 1997 ) , which has the same type of visual declines ( albeit shallower : @xmath51  mag ; jones et al .",
    "1999 ) as rcb stars and the peculiar [ wc12 ] ( crowther , de marco & barlow 1998 ) v348 sgr , which is one of the most active rcb stars . the latter star , is also suspected to be a born - again star because its effective temperature could not maintain the pn s observed degree of ionization ( pollacco , hill & tudhunter 1990 ) .",
    "the problem is therefore to understand what fraction of rcb stars share a common evolution ( wd - merger scenario or he - shell flash ) and what fraction simply shares the light - curve behavior and is grouped in the rcb evolutionary class for lack of a better explanation .",
    "one might argue that the abundances should suffice as a discriminator .",
    "however beside the abundances , there are other characteristics which should be taken into account when grouping these stars , because they seem to dictate different grouping rules . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the above - mentioned v348 sgr , which , together with dy cen , mv sgr and hv  2671 ( in the lmc ; alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) , constitute the class of hot rcb stars ( @xmath115000 - 20000  k ) . in both scenarios presently considered for the evolution of rcb stars ( born - again or merging wds )",
    ", cool rcb stars should proceed at roughly constant luminosity toward the hotter region of the hr diagram .",
    "therefore the hot rcb stars might be reasonably thought to represent the progeny of the cool ones .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the hot rcb stars in all their observable aspects , to try and place them in relation to other post - agb stars .",
    "the abundances of the hot rcb stars , suggest that two of them , dy cen and mv sgr , should be classified as successors of the typical he - dominated cool rcb stars while v348 sgr and hv  2671 might belong to the post - agb born - again group .",

    "one would expect the weaker emission lines to be produced in a smaller region of the disk than the stronger lines and hence have a larger line width due to the greater rotational velocities of the inner regions of such a disk ( e.g. the weaker fe  ii lines have a greater width than h@xmath8 for be stars disks ; dachs , hummel & hanuschik 1992 ) .",
    "however the line widths of the weaker emission lines are systematically lower than those of stronger transitions for mv  sgr ( pandey et al .",
    "2 .   the high resolution line profiles presented for mv  sgr by pandey et al . ( 1996 ) show large asymmetries in the peak ratios of the double peaked line profiles . in classical",
    "be stars this is attributed to the slow precession of a one armed density wave within the keplerian disk ( e.g. okazaki 1997 ) and the peak ratios of different lines are observed to vary in phase ( such that for a given time the blue peak is stronger than the red [ or vice versa ] for all lines ) .",
    "the line profiles for mv  sgr clearly show that this is not the case , and the asymmetries can not arise from the precession of a density wave within a keplerian disk .",
    "the p - cygni components of the line profiles of mv  sgr and v348  sgr are _ not _ observed for classical be stars . indeed , there is strong evidence that the radial component of the disk velocity is highly subsonic ( @xmath211  km  s@xmath6 ) until large radii ( of the order of 100r@xmath30 ; okazaki 2001 ) , well outside the region responsible for line formation .",

    "keplerian excretion _",
    "disks found around classical be stars .",

    "polarimetric observations of r crb suggest the presence of an obscuring dusty torus ( rao & lambert 1993 , clayton et al .",
    "1997 ) , while changes in the polarization of other rcb stars during deep declines suggest the observed light is scattered ( e.g. clayton 1996 , and references within ) - obscuration of the star by an equatorial torus with scattering of light from the polar axis into the line of sight would explain these observations .",
    "the formation of dust in a spherical wind is also difficult because at large radii , where the temperature is low enough to allow dust to condense ( @xmath13000",
    "k ) for mass - loss rates as low as those observed for hv  2671 & v348  sgr ( table  [ tab : model ] ) , the wind density is simply too low to allow dust formation ( e.g. bjorkman 1998 ) ; a ` disk ' or ` torus ' could permit high enough densities to exist for dust to form .",
    "additionally , the higher densities allow more efficient cooling - modeling of the energy balance of geometrically thin disks around be stars by millar & marlborough ( 1999 ) suggest that they are approximately isothermal with a temperature of @xmath10.5t@xmath31 . with additional cooling due to the high metal content of hot - rcb winds and the possibility of self shielding produced by a geometrically thick disk the temperature within such a structure may be low enough to permit dust formation .",
    "a class of objects where the same problem of dust production in an hostile environment occurs are the b[e ] stars , stars of spectral type b with a rich emission line spectrum and pronounced ir excess due to the presence of equatorially concentrated hot dust ( the presence of forbidden line emission and hot dust distinguishes these objects from classical be stars ) .",
    "however galactic b[e ] stars are a rather heterogeneous class due to difficulties in determining absolute luminosities and comprise both pre- and post - main sequence stars , with luminosities ranging from log(@xmath32 ) = 2.56.5 ( zorec 1998 ) . lamers et al . ( 1998 ) provide a summary of known objects and conclude that 12 galactic b[e ] stars are likely to be compact pne , while a smaller number appears to be post - agb objects - hen  3 - 1191 ( lamers et al .",

    "given that the hot - rcb stars share many of the same observational properties as the b[e ] stars ( indeed mv  sgr meets the membership criteria listed by lamers et al . [ 1998 ] ) and other objects initially classified as b[e ] stars are now recognized to be post - agb objects , it is tempting to suggest that the hot - rcb stars share a similar circumstellar environment as the b[e ] stars .",
    "inspection of the spectrum of the b[e ] star hd  87643 ( oudmaijer et al .",
    "1998 ) shows that the profiles of the h  i balmer series closely resemble those of the strong emission lines of c  i , he  i and h  i in mv  sgr which also show 2 absorption components ; a pronounced p - cygni absorption trough ( at @xmath1100 km  s@xmath6 - the larger velocity of the blue edge of the p - cygni profile in hd  87643 reflecting a higher terminal velocity ) and the central reversal ( which appears to be slightly blue shifted in both hd  87643 and mv  sgr ; pandy et al .",
    "additionally , as with mv  sgr , the weaker fe  ii lines in hd  87643 are observed to be half the width of the balmer lines , while the observable forbidden lines are narrower still .",
    "the same is also true of v348  sgr and dy  cen although we note that the central reversals in these stars do not show any velocity shift , apparently indicating absorption by @xmath1stationary material .",
    "we note that this behavior is also observed for the be shell stars which have deep central absorption troughs - it is thought that these stars represent the subset of classical be stars that are seen at high inclinations where the line of sight lies close to or in the equatorial plane and hence intersecting the circumstellar disk .",
    "oudmaijer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) interpret this behavior as a result of the presence of at least 2 and probably 3 different wind regimes ; a very strong high velocity wind responsible for the broad balmer lines ( and the p - cygni absorption ) , a second , lower velocity wind traced by the fe  ii lines and the core of the balmer lines ( the central absorption is attributed to self absorption in a slow wind rather than doppler splitting due to rotational motion ) .",
    "the final component , sampled by the narrow forbidden lines is attributed to a possible low density nebula ( c.f .",
    "v348  sgr and dy  cen ) .",
    "furthermore , changes in the polarization across the h@xmath8 line and adjacent continuum clearly indicates a departure from spherical symmetry and indicate the presence of both expansion and rotational velocity components ( note that line emission from the classical be star disks shows _ _ no evidence for radial expansion ) .",
    "oudmaijer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest that the varying wind regimes can be accommodated in a scenario where a radiation driven wind from a slowly expanding dense circumstellar disk ( responsible for the fe  ii lines and central absorption in the balmer lines ) interacts with a faster polar wind ( responsible for the p - cygni absorption line components ) - given the similarities in the line profiles of the hot - rcb stars to those of hd  87643 we suggest a similar hybrid wind regime could be present in these stars as well .",

    "the split lines components do not reside at similar radial velocities which excludes a keplerian disk as their origin . on the other hand ,",

    "finally , we would expect the h@xmath8 profile in the spectrum of v348 sgr to also exhibit a double peak .",

    "the issue of the presence and characteristics of nebulosities around rcb stars and other h - deficient stars like extreme helium stars or hydrogen - deficient carbon stars , is paramount to solving the question of their origin . beside the evidence for ionized shells around the three hot rcb stars , we know that uw cen has a neutral nebula that is about 15  arcsec across ( pollacco et al .",

    "so mv sgr and dy cen are likely to be producing dust but not along our line of sight to the star .    the range of decline activity seen in the hot rcb stars mimics that seen in the cooler rcb stars ( clayton 1996 ) .",

    "the maximum - light brightness has been fairly constant since then .",
    "hv  2671 has by far the least photometric coverage of the four stars . based on the published data , median m@xmath54 = 16.4  mag pre-1940 , and b = 15.5  mag in 1967 , little can be said about any possible evolution of its maximum brightness .",
    "the fact that three out of the four known hot rcb stars seem to be fading slowly with time may indicate that stars in the hot rcb class are evolving rapidly .",
    "the change might in fact indicate either an intrinsic fading of the star ( due to an overall fading of the bolometric luminosity or to a change of temperature ) or an increase in the circumstellar reddening .",
    "taking first the case where the change in v brightness is due to a change in temperature , we note that for constant @xmath55 , @xmath561 , corresponds to a decrease of the bc by the same amount .",

    "( we use the bolometric corrections for normal supergiant stars [ allen , astrophysical quantities , 4@xmath57 edition ] .",
    "although this is generally not appropriate for rcb stars , the fact that we are using relative values , and that we are not extracting precise quantities , make this method suitable .",
    "additionally the bc of leuenhagen & hamann ( 1994 ) of 1.71  mag determined for the 20kk v348 sgr , is similar to the values listed in astrophysical quantities for a 17.6kk b2 supergiant of 1.58  mag ) .",
    "an increase in the effective temperature between 11.1 and 17.6  kk would be accompanied by a change in the star",
    "s @xmath48 by only @xmath10.14  mag .",
    "if the change in @xmath13 by @xmath11  mag were due to reddening , @xmath58a@xmath59 = 1 translates to a @xmath58(@xmath48 ) @xmath1 0.32  mag .",
    "therefore the color can help discriminate between a temperature and a reddening change .",
    "the data are fragmentary but they show no color trend : dy cen was observed to have @xmath10 = 12.39  mag and @xmath48 = 0.31  mag in 1972 and @xmath10 = 12.78  mag and @xmath48 = 0.33  mag in 1987 ( rao et al . 1993 ) .",
    "so for dy cen , the fading is inconsistent with a reddening increase , while it is more consistent with a temperature increase by @xmath16000  k.    the maximum - light brightness and color of mv sgr was observed to be @xmath13 = 12.70  mag and @xmath48 = 0.26  mag in 1963 ( herbig 1964 ) and @xmath13 = 13.29  mag , @xmath48 = 0.262  mag in 2000 ( average of 8 observations , landolt 2001 priv .",
    "its maximum - light brightness faded by @xmath60 = 0.6  mag but its @xmath48 color remained unchanged . if the fading was due to added circumstellar reddening then we would expect @xmath48 to become redder by @xmath10.2  mag .",
    "so like dy cen , the mv sgr fading is inconsistent with a reddening increase .",
    "v348 sgr is much more active than the other two stars and could therefore be a better candidate for a reddening increase , rather than a change in temperature .",
    "however we would still like to argue that v348 sgr , too , has suffered an increase in temperature , rather than a change in reddening .",

    "the two cool rcb stars show no maximum light fading trend .",
    "finally , we should point out that the @xmath13 brightness data is also consistent with a decrease in the bolometric luminosity .",
    "a @xmath61 = 1.0  mag corresponds to a decrease in luminosity by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "this can not be excluded , although this type of luminosity changes would be hard to interpret in the light of single star post - agb evolution .",
    "here we check whether the variability in luminosity is accompanied by any type of spectral variability over the period of time for which archival data were available .",

    "we can therefore detect the presence or absence of emission lines , or a complete change of the line makeup of the spectrum .",
    "changes in temperature , abundance or in wind strength inducing even a 50% change in our lines equivalent widths might be missed .",

    "we find no significant sign of change .",
    "however , the red spectrum ( @xmath15500 - 7000   ) from 1953 exhibits a deep absorption line at about 5850   .",

    "mv sgr has strong emission lines that belong mostly to heavy elements , with only weak carbon and nitrogen emission and absorption . solely on the basis of the spectrum one would group v348 sgr and hv  2671 together , leaving dy cen and mv sgr in two separate categories .",
    "2 .   the stellar temperatures are in the range 15 - 20  kk .",

    "the abundances span a wide range .",
    "v348 sgr , and presumably hv  2671 , are very carbon - rich , grouping closely with the members of the [ wc ] central stars of pn ( e.g. leuenhagen et al .",

    "for hv  2671 we do not have enough data to draw any conclusions .",
    "this behavior , seen in v348 sgr and dy cen , could be consistent with strengthening of the wind and hence an increase in mass - loss , but a third epoch with overlapping spectral range is necessary in order to validate this conclusion .",
    "the absorption lines of dy cen have changed in position between 1989 and 1992 .",
    "this behavior is highly suggestive of binarity ( as first suggested by giridhar et al .",
    "4 .   v348 sgr and dy cen ( in 1992 ) exhibit split emission lines of he  i and c  ii ( though h@xmath8 , were it not contaminated by nebular emission , would also show the same split ) .",

    "* v348 sgr . * clearly , v348 sgr distinguishes itself from the other two objects because of its high carbon abundance . because of its prominent emission line spectrum , it has been also been classified as a [ wc12 ] wolf - rayet central star of pn .",
    "however , it does not fit seamlessly into the late type wolf - rayet star class ( see the properties listed by koesterke [ 2001 ] ) .",
    "v348 sgr has a large , extended pn in contrast to most other stars of this group which have rather young ( compact and high density ) pne ( e.g cpd-56@xmath48032 and he2 - 113 [ de marco et al .",
    "1997 ] , m4 - 18 [ de marco & crowther 1998 ] ) , although it is not dissimilar from the large tenuous pn of the [ wc11 ] star k2 - 16 .",
    "no doubt , the [ wc ] class remains enigmatic , but the very fact that it is an heterogeneous one ( possibly comprising several undiscovered born - again stars ) , means that it can accommodate v348 sgr among its members .",
    "thus , from the properties of the pn , v348 sgr might in fact be the only late - type [ wc ] star which owes its h - deficiency to a born - again evolutionary history .",
    "however , v348 sgr displays a suspiciously small oxygen abundance .",
    "if this star had initially formed from a sun - like composition , then its initial oxygen abundance would have been between 0.5 and 1@xmath63 by mass .",
    "herwig ( 2000 ) presented agb models which include additional mixing processes resulting in abundances consistent with the oxygen mass fractions observed in the majority of the [ wc]-like and pg1159 stars .",
    "basically , additional dredge - up induced by convective overshoot leads to a higher oxygen abundance in the agb intershell .",
    "in the course of the mixing ( and possibly burning processes ) associated with the born - again evolution , the intershell material , which contains significant amounts of carbon , come to the surface .",
    "if this mechanism is responsible for the hydrogen - deficiency and the huge carbon abundance of v348 sgr ( @xmath64 ) , then we would expect a significant amount of oxygen , much higher then the observed upper limit of 1% .",
    "[ wc]-type ( early and late ) and pg1159 stars have oxygen abundances in the range 5 - 15% , consisten with evolutionary models .",
    "very low oxygen abundances are however not unheard of .",
    "one other [ wc]-late type star ( iras21282 + 5050 ) and one pg1159 star ( ngc7094 ) have similarly low oxygen abundances .",
    "therefore , although the old nebula and the h - deficiency support a born - again evolutionary origin for v348 sgr , the very low oxygen abundance casts serious doubts on this interpretation .",
    "unfortunately , the alternative , a wd - merger scenario , does not help us either . while it would be possible to accommodate a very low oxygen abundance ,",
    "this scenario could not account for the large carbon abundance .",
    "* this star has characteristics in common with both v348 sgr and mv sgr .",
    "the nebular properties are similar to those of v348 sgr ( a low pn expansion velocity and a low pn electron density , generally compatible with a born - again evolution ) .",
    "in addition this star shares with v348 sgr signs of increasing wind activity .",
    "however , the stellar chemistry is - as is the case in mv sgr - dominated by helium like the cool rcb stars",
    ". _ helium predominance is irreproducible by any current single star agb or post - agb evolutionary calculations_. another difficulty is the high carbon abundance ( 15 times solar ) . even if it were possible to uncover the helium - rich layer left over from h - shell burning , evolutionary calculations predict nitrogen , not carbon , as the dominant element after helium .",
    "in addition , although the understanding of the internal mixing processes has improved , uncertainties remain .",
    "dy cen is clearly the star in the hot rcb class , which is most likely to be a progeny of the majority group of cool rcb stars .",
    "* due to the predominance of helium in the stellar atmosphere of mv sgr , we might conclude that this star is too a typical descendant of the cool rcb class .",
    "it shares with the other two stars the decreasing visual luminosity , which we interpret as increasing stellar temperature , indicating a leftward motion in the hr diagram , consistent with a post - agb star increasing in temperature .",
    "however , the cno elements are dominated by nitrogen ( after helium ) as expected for the result of hydrogen burning .",
    "the interpretation that we do , in fact , see the helium - layer , resulting from hydrogen - shell burning , is consistent with the absence of any hydrogen .",
    "however , it is unclear how hydrogen was eliminated to uncover the helium layer : the absence of hydrogen can not result from hydrogen - ingestion during a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) : during a vltp , hydrogen is ingested into the @xmath65c - rich layers of the intershell region .",
    "there the @xmath65c abundance is such that proton - capture transformation of @xmath65c into @xmath66c dominates , and only a little @xmath67n , if any , can form .",
    "mv sgr has a high expansion velocity , high density , hydrogen - rich nebula , inconsistent with the born - again scenario unless deeper imaging detect a low - density extended pn around it , and/or the central nebulosity proves to be hydrogen - deficient .",
    "this star requires an evolutionary scenario capable of removing the remaining envelope completely , but not through dredge - up , which would leave some trace of hydrogen in the photosphere , or through hydrogen - ingestion mechanism associated with the vltp .",
    "current stellar evolutionary models can not explain this star .",
    "the stellar abundances seems to point to at least three classes for the four hot rcb stars ! yet , other characteristics , though never entirely homogeneous , seem to draw these stars together .",
    "one question is therefore raised , whether a post - agb star , with , say , rcb - type abundances can change significantly its photospheric abundances to become , say , a [ wc]-like type star . such change , happening not during the agb , but in the post - agb phase , is not in agreement with evolutionary calculations .",
    "however , in view of the strangeness of these stellar classes , it can not be excluded a priori .",
    "the suggestion that the spectrum of dy cen is developing stronger emission lines , and becoming similar to that of the chemically very different v348 sgr , make this possibility appealing .",
    "further spectroscopy , to confirm a long - term change which is not either periodic or stochastic shorter term variability , is therefore eagerly sought .",
    "if the hot rcb stars turn out to be the progeny of the cooler ones , we might also wonder about the possibility that the hot rcb stars constitute a link between the cool rcb stars and the chemically similar extreme helium stars .",
    "this was extensively discussed by pandey et al .",
    "they conclude that it is not straightforward to establish a link between the two classes , on the basis of different heavy element abundances . again",
    ", if we could open the possibility of significant abundance changes , there might be a new open evolutionary channel _ out _ of the rcb class .",
    "o(he ) stars , which are hot h - deficient post agb stars ( four are known , of which two are associated with a pn ; werner 2001 ) have been proposed as descendants of the rcb stars .",
    "however they might be too hydrogen - rich ( lotr4 has 33% hydrogen by mass ; rauch et al .",
    "1996,1998 ) to make definitive conclusions .",
    "last , we have shown how all the hot rcb stars for which we have high resolution data , show split lines .",
    "we have interpreted these lines as an equatorial bulge , similar to what is interpreted to be around b[e ] stars , and _ not _ a keplerian disk , which might have pointed to binarity .",
    "the origin of this bulge is not understood , but it might be a key in the explanation of the dust - making activity of these stars , since it might present a denser , more shielded environment where dust could condense . understanding the spectral variability properties of the split lines is paramount in characterizing the evolution of the equatorial enhancement , as well as how it relates to the pulsation variability observed in other rcb stars .",
    "regarding the possibility that rcb stars derive from the merger of a helium and a co wd , we note that dy cen is likely to be a binary .",
    "although further observations are sought , this fact alone would contradict a merger scenario , which is more likely to result in a single star ( jefferey & saio 2002 ) .",
    "we thank simon jeffery for providing the high resolution spectrum of v348 sgr .",

    "<S> rcb stars are typically cool , hydrogen deficient supergiants . </S>",
    "<S> the four stars studied in this paper are hotter ( t@xmath0 = 15 - 20  kk ) than the majority of rcb stars ( t@xmath0 = 5000 - 7000  k ) . although these are commonly grouped together as the _ hot rcb stars </S>",
    "<S> _ they do not necessarily share a common evolutionary history . </S>",
    "<S> we present new observational data and an extensive collection of archival and previously - published data which is reassessed to ensure internal consistency . </S>",
    "<S> we find temporal variations of various properties on different time scales which will eventually help us to uncover the evolutionary history of these objects . </S>",
    "<S> dy cen and mv sgr have typical rcb helium abundances which excludes any currently known post - agb evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , their carbon and nitrogen abundances present us with further problems for their interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> v348 sgr and hv  2671 are in general agreement with a born - again post - agb evolution and their abundances are similar to wolf - rayet central stars of pn . </S>",

    "<S> sgr and dy cen have low density , low expansion velocity nebulae ( resolved in the case of v348 sgr ) , while mv sgr has a higher density , higher expansion velocity nebula . </S>",
    "<S> all three stars on the other hand have split emission lines which indicate the presence of an equatorial bulge but _ not _ of a keplerian disk . in addition , the historical light - curves for the three galactic hot rcb stars , show evidence for a significant fading in their maximum - light brightnesses of @xmath11  mag over the last 70  yr . from this we deduce that their effective temperature increased by a few thousand degrees . if v348 sgr is a born - again star , as we presume , this means that the star is returning from the born - again agb phase to the central star of pn phase . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopically , no dramatic change is observed over the last 50 years for v348 sgr and mv sgr . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is some evidence that the winds of v348 sgr and dy cen have increased in strength in the last decade . </S>",
