    "a _ rack _ is a non - associative algebraic structure whose axioms correspond to the framed reidemeister moves . _ quandles _ are specific types of racks whose axioms correspond to the three unframed reidemeister moves . every framed knot or link",
    "has a _ fundamental rack _ described by generators and relations which may be read from any diagram of the knot or link .",
    "similarly , every unframed knot or link has a _ fundamental quandle _ @xcite .",
    "the _ rack and quandle counting invariants _ are integer - valued invariants determined by the number of homomorphisms from the fundamental rack and quandle of a knot or link , which can be pictured as colorings of a knot or link diagram .",
    "invariants of quandle and rack colored knot diagrams define _ enhancements _ of the counting invariant ; enhancements can also make use of extra structure of the coloring quandle or rack . in either case , enhancements specialize to the original counting invariants and in most cases strengthen them . in this paper",
    "we will introduce enhancements of the rack counting invariants using sets with right actions by a rack we call _ rack shadows _",
    "( also known as _ rack sets _ ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ b ]",
    "we recall the basics of racks , quandles , and their counting invariants . in section [ sb ]",
    "we recall rack shadows and shadow colorings of link diagrams . in section [ sbinv ]",
    "we enhance the shadow counting invariants with shadow polynomials and show that the enhanced invariants contain more information ( and are thus stronger ) than the unenhanced counting invariants . in section [ q ]",
    "we collect questions for future research .",
    "we begin with a definition from @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 , and    @xmath4 .",
    "racks can be understood as sets with binary operations in which right `` multiplication '' by every element is an automorphism .",
    "it is a standard exercise to check that in any rack we also have    @xmath5 ,    @xmath6 , and    @xmath7 .    to every finite rack @xmath8 we associate an @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 encoding the operation table of the rack , called the _",
    "rack matrix_. specifically , the entry in row @xmath11 column @xmath12 of @xmath10 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "[ ex1 ] @xmath15.\\ ] ]    it follows easily from the rack axioms that every column in a rack matrix must be a permutation of @xmath16 .",
    "it is also true ( see @xcite , corollary 2 ) , though perhaps less obvious , that the diagonal of a rack matrix must be a permutation .",
    "the _ rack rank _ of @xmath1 is the exponent of the diagonal permutation regarded as an element of the symmetric group @xmath17 .    in the case",
    "that @xmath18 is the fundamental rack of an oriented framed link @xmath19 , a unique homomorphism @xmath20 may be specified by assigning an element of @xmath21 to each arc of @xmath19 such that the _ crossing condition _",
    "@xmath22 is satisfied at every crossing .",
    "such an assignment of elements of @xmath21 to arcs in @xmath19 is known as a _ rack coloring _ of @xmath19 by @xmath21 .",
    "the relationship between the rack axioms and the framed reidemeister moves guarantees that rack colorings are preserved by framed reidemeister moves , in the sense that a rack coloring of a diagram before a move corresponds to a unique rack coloring of the diagram after the move .",
    "thus , if @xmath23 is a finite rack and @xmath24 is a framed oriented knot , the number of rack colorings @xmath25 of @xmath24 by @xmath23 is an invariant of framed isotopy . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for finite racks @xmath23 , the numbers of colorings of two framings of @xmath24 are equal if the writhes of the diagrams differ by a multiple of the rack rank @xmath26 of @xmath23 . more generally , if @xmath27 is a link with @xmath13 ordered components , then @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath19 ambient isotopic to @xmath30 implies that the rack colorings of @xmath19 and @xmath30 by @xmath23 are in one - to - one correspondence . for",
    "a framing vector @xmath31 let us abbreviate @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "then we thus have :    [ def : rcinv ] @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that :    let @xmath19 and @xmath30 be oriented links and @xmath23 a finite rack .",
    "if @xmath19 is ambient isotopic to @xmath30 then we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    unlike groups , in which the trivial action is concentrated in a single identity element , trivial action is distributed throughout the structure in racks .",
    "we quantify this distribution with a _ rack polynomial_.",
    "@xmath38    we can easily compute the rack polynomial of a rack from its rack matrix by counting the number of occurrences of the row number in each row and column .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that :    if @xmath23 and @xmath39 are isomorphic racks , then @xmath40 .    given a subrack of a rack @xmath1",
    ", there is a _ subrack polynomial _ which captures information both about the subrack itself and how it is embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath41    rack polynomials can be used to define an enhancement of the rack counting invariant , as described in @xcite .",
    "specifically , for each rack coloring we find the image subrack and use its subrack polynomial as a `` signature '' of the coloring .",
    "the multiset of such polynomials paired with framing information then yields an enhancement of the rack counting invariant ; alternatively we can convert to a `` polynomial - style '' format .",

    "in this section we define _ rack shadows _ ( also known as _ rack sets _ ) which can be used to generalize the _ shadow colorings _ of knot diagrams by quandles described in previous work such as @xcite .",

    "consider a rack coloring of @xmath19 and choose a region of @xmath19 .",
    "any element of @xmath0 can be assigned to the chosen region , and any such choice determines a unique shadow coloring by pushing the color across the arcs with @xmath66 or @xmath67 .    [ cor1 ] the shadow counting invariant of a link @xmath19 by an @xmath1-shadow @xmath0 is given by @xmath68    just as racks have rack polynomials , we can define a polynomial invariant of @xmath1-shadows :    @xmath69 @xmath70    if two @xmath1-shadows @xmath0 and @xmath50 are isomorphic , we have @xmath71    suppose @xmath55 is an @xmath1-shadow isomorphism",
    ". then @xmath72 and the contribution to @xmath73 from @xmath74 is equal to the contribution to @xmath75 from @xmath76 .",
    "since every @xmath77 is equal to @xmath78 for some @xmath74 and conversely , it follows that the sums are equal .",
    "unfortunately , corollary [ cor1 ] implies that the unenhanced shadow counting invariant does not contain any more information than the ordinary rack counting invariant .",
    "if we want to exploit rack shadows , then , we must look to enhancements .    for the rack @xmath1-shadow @xmath65 in the case that @xmath1 is quandle , this is done in @xcite with cocycles in the third cohomology of the target quandle @xmath79 .",
    "these invariants have a natural interpretation in terms of quandle colorings of knotted surfaces in @xmath80 . in this section",
    "we will take a different approach , using @xmath1-shadow polynomials to define an enhancement .",
    "it is easy to see that the shadow image of a shadow colored link diagram is invariant under framed reidemeister moves , and thus its subshadow polynomial can be used as a signature of the shadow coloring .",
