    "our recent work@xcite on an effective action for dynamical quarks has caused us to examine the simple picture in which deconfinement and chiral symmetry are independent . on the basis of this work",

    ", this model explicitly constructs a free energy dependent on the two order parameters , in the spirit of landau - ginsberg arguments . because this model generates an effective potential consistent with two - flavor qcd",
    ", we will show that the class of critical behaviors possible in finite temperature qcd is _ a priori _ larger than has been previously realized .",

    "we denote @xmath32 by @xmath33 . near the deconfinement temperature",
    "@xmath34 the potential of polyakov loops in pure qcd can be approximated by a polynomial potential of the form @xcite @xmath35 the potential is parametrized such that for a pure gauge theory the phase transition occurs at @xmath34 with a latent heat @xmath36 and the polyakov loop jumping from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "this choice for @xmath39 is phenomenological .",
    "although perturbative qcd does yield a quartic polynomial potential for the @xmath19 field , the potential so obtained does not display critical behavior , and it is only valid at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , it does suggest that the parameter @xmath40 should be taken to be on the order of @xmath41 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the numerical calculations below , neglecting any possible temperature corrections or other dependencies in @xmath40 , @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 .",
    "the direct association of @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 with measureable quantities holds only for very heavy quarks . for light quarks",
    ", these parameters must be determined by fitting to the observed behavior .",

    ", the absolute minimum of the potential @xmath47 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath33 must be found as @xmath48 is varied .",
    "a satisfactory determination of the entire phase diagram requires numerical investigation .",
    "the two flavor nambu - jona - lasinio model has a second - order chiral phase transition for massless quarks . for the parameter set used here , this transition occurs at @xmath49 mev , as determined numerically from @xmath50 .",
    "the order of the transition is consistent with monte carlo simulations of two - flavor qcd , and the critical temperature is plausible .",
    "however , the finite temperature quark determinant is not consistent with the known behavior of qcd unless the effects of a non - trivial polyakov loop are included . as eq .",
    "[ e2.16 ] makes clear , the effects of finite temperature in the quark determinant are suppressed by the small expected value of the polyakov loop at low temperatures . without the polyakov loop effects , the conventional nambu - jona - lasinio model displays the @xmath51 behavior of a free quark gas at arbitrarily low temperatures .",
    "numerical investigation shows that the critical behavior of @xmath47 is most sensitive to @xmath34 and @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] illustrates the three distinct types of critical behavior observed as @xmath34 and @xmath38 are varied with the other parameters held fixed and the current mass @xmath4 set to @xmath37 . in region",
    "i of the @xmath52 plane the effective quark mass changes continuously from its @xmath53 value to a mass of @xmath37 mev as the temperature increases , signaling a second - order chiral phase transition .",
    "simultaneously , the expectation value of the trace of the polyakov loop increases smoothly with temperature , exhibiting a large , but continuous , increase in the vicinity of the chiral transition .",
    "this region exhibits behavior most similar to that observed in simulations of two - flavor qcd . in region",
    "ii the polyakov loop experiences a first - order jump at some @xmath54 . at the same @xmath54",
    "the constituent quark mass undergoes a sudden drop , but chiral symmetry is _ not _ restored . as the temperature increases beyond @xmath54 ,",
    "the constituent mass moves continuously to zero .",
    "thus , there are two distinct phase transitions in region ii , a first - order transition driven by the dynamics of deconfinement , and a later second - order chiral symmetry restoring transition . in region",
    "iii the polyakov loop experiences a first - order jump at some @xmath54 , and simultaneously the effective quark mass drops suddenly to @xmath37 mev , indicating a single first - order transition which restores chiral symmetry .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the location of the three regions in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] plots the behavior of the polyakov loop , @xmath33 , and the constituent quark mass , @xmath6 , as a function of temperature at the point @xmath55 in region ii .",
    "there is a clear separation of the first and second - order transitions .",
    "a lattice version of the effective potential has the advantage that many parameters can be set from qcd simulations .",
    "there are two related issues in extending our work to the lattice : the choice of a lattice fermion formalism and setting other parameters in the effective action .",
    "a lattice version of the njl model can be straightforwardly implemented using naive fermions @xcite .",
    "species doubling can be handled by a formal replacement of @xmath56 with @xmath57 . using the single quark current mass , chiral condensate , and constituent mass of the last section as inputs , we find @xmath58 hence , @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "also note that @xmath61 is of order 1 .",
    "the temperature is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the temporal extent of the lattice .",
    "this places a problematic upper limit on a discrete range of available temperatures .",
    "given our choice of parameters , @xmath64 is only @xmath65 @xmath60 .",
    "the temperature may be changed continuously by an asymmetric rescaling of the lattice in which the lattice spacing @xmath66 in the temporal direction varies independently of the spatial lattice spacing @xmath67 @xcite . defining @xmath68 and @xmath69 ,",

    "an alternative to asymmetric lattices might be variant or improved actions for which @xmath79 is larger .",
    "polyakov loop effects have a strong impact on the possible critical behavior of the njl model . the universality argument @xcite which predicts a second - order chiral transition for two flavors and a first - order transition for three or more flavors may fail when this additional order parameter is included .",
