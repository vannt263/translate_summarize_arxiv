    "cdf found a handful of @xmath8 events in a data sample of 2.6  pb@xmath9 taken during the tevatron run0 at the end of the 1980 s .",
    "this era was followed by a successful @xmath0  physics program during the tevatron 1992 - 1996 runi data taking period ( for example , for a review of @xmath0  physics results from cdf in runi see ref .",

    "the study of @xmath0  hadrons has become an established part of the physics program at hadron colliders including the future lhc experiments atlas and cms or the dedicated @xmath0  physics experiment lhcb .    in many cases ,",
    "the measurements performed at the tevatron collider are complementary to those at the @xmath0  factories .",
    "in particular , all @xmath0  hadron states are produced at the tevatron . besides the neutral @xmath10 and the charged @xmath11 which are the only products at the @xmath6  resonance , the tevatron is also a source of @xmath0  mesons containing @xmath12- or @xmath13-quark :  and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , baryons containing bottom quarks such as the ,  or @xmath14 are produced at the tevatron . an additional bonus for @xmath0  physics measurements at the tevatron is the enormous cross section for @xmath15  quark production in @xmath5  collisions .",
    "the cross section for the production of @xmath16 or @xmath17  pairs at the @xmath6  resonance is about 1  nb , while @xmath18 is @xmath19b in the central detector region , several orders of magnitude larger .    in this review",

    "the luminous region of the tevatron beam has an rms of @xmath21  cm  along the beam - line ( @xmath22-direction ) with a transverse beam - width of about 25 - 30  @xmath23 m .",
    "the initial tevatron luminosity steadily increased from 2002 to 2008 with a peak luminosity of @xmath24  @xmath25s@xmath9 reached by the tevatron in spring 2008 .",
    "the total integrated luminosity delivered by the tevatron to cdf and d0 at the time of this conference is @xmath26  fb@xmath9 with about @xmath27  fb@xmath9 recorded to tape by each collider experiment .",
    "however , most results presented in this review use about 1 - 3  fb@xmath9 of data . the features of the cdf and d0 detectors are described elsewhere in references  @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    the total inelastic @xmath5",
    "cross section at the tevatron is about three orders of magnitude larger than the @xmath15  quark production cross section .",
    "the cdf and d0  trigger system is therefore the most important tool for finding @xmath0  decay products .",
    "first , cdf and d0 both exploit heavy flavour decays with leptons in the final state .",
    "identification of dimuon events down to very low momentum is also possible , allowing for efficient @xmath28 triggers . as a consequence ,",

    "the interaction between the @xmath15  quark and the other quark(s ) in a @xmath0  hadron is based on the strong interaction or quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is often stated that heavy quark hadrons are the hydrogen atom of qcd .",
    "the study of @xmath0  hadron states is thus the study of ( non - perturbative ) qcd which provides sensitive tests of potential models , hqet and all aspects of qcd including lattice gauge calculations .",
    "until a couple of years ago , excited meson states containing @xmath15  quarks , referred to as @xmath1 , have not been studied well .",
