    "high - precision measurements in light atomic systems permit accurate tests of the quantum - electrodynamics theory ( qed ) .",
    "qed calculations enter into a number of fundamental values related to free particles and simple atoms . in conventional atomic systems the accuracy of qed tests is restricted by insufficient knowledge of the nuclear structure which is the main obstacle on the way to improve theoretical predictions for the lamb shift and the hyperfine structure in hydrogen ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the leading corrections for different energy levels coming from nuclear size effects are proportional to the squared value of non - relativistic wave function of the electron at the origin : @xmath5 where the value of the coefficient @xmath6 is determined by parameters of the nucleus and does not depend on atomic quantum numbers . for @xmath7levels in hydrogen - like systems the non - relativistic wave function at the origin scales with the principal quantum number @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "thus , if one takes the following difference of the energies @xmath10 corresponding to two different @xmath7levels @xmath11 , the leading contribution of nuclear effects cancels .",
    "recently , a significant progress in calculations of the @xmath12 difference of @xmath13 and @xmath14 hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) intervals in light hydrogen - like atoms has been achieved @xcite .",
    "new state - dependent qed terms to the hfs interval frequency @xmath15 up to the fractional order of @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been calculated as well as the next - to - leading nuclear structure effects .",
    "the accuracy of this theoretical prediction for @xmath4 exceeds now the experimental accuracy which is mainly restricted by the uncertainty in the determination of the @xmath18",
    ".    experimental results are available for the @xmath14 and @xmath13 hyperfine interval in hydrogen @xcite , deuterium @xcite and the helium-3 ion @xcite .",
    "the study of neutral atoms and ions requires different experimental techniques .",
    "while @xmath14 hfs intervals in neutral atoms @xcite have been measured with a higher relative accuracy as in the helium-3 ion @xcite , the @xmath13 hfs intervals in hydrogen @xcite and deuterium @xcite are known less precisely as in the helium-3 ion @xcite .",
    "since the traditional microwave methods have likely reached their limits we have been working on an optical determination of the hyperfine interval in the metastable @xmath13 state of hydrogen and deuterium .",
    "recently we have measured the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath13 state of the hydrogen atom applying an optical technique @xcite .",
    "it is based on two - photon spectroscopy on a cold beam shielded from magnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath13 hfs interval has been determined from the frequency difference of two stable light fields exciting @xmath14@xmath13 transitions for singlet ( @xmath19 ) and triplet ( @xmath20 ) components .",
    "the differential method cancels a number of systematic effects intrinsic to two - photon spectroscopy which provides a significant increase of accuracy in comparison with absolute frequency measurements @xcite .",
    "we have improved this technique @xcite and applied it to the spectroscopy of atomic deuterium .",
    "the hyperfine structure in deuterium is approximately 4 times smaller than in hydrogen and its accurate optical measurement is a harder problem , however , a smaller hfs value has also some advantages due to a reduction of certain systematic effects for the comparison of the @xmath14@xmath13 frequencies between different spin states .",
    "the experiment and its systematic effects are presented in two following sections while a comparison of theory and experiment is summarized in the concluding part of the paper .",
    "the @xmath13 hfs interval has been measured once by reich , heberle , and kusch @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath21 has been obtained by a radio - frequency ( rf ) method applied earlier to a similar measurement in hydrogen @xcite . in comparison to the hydrogen measurement @xcite",
    ", the absolute accuracy of determination of @xmath22 @xcite has been improved by a factor of 3 . in spite of the fact that the hfs intervals in deuterium are strongly affected by magnetic fields , as in hydrogen , the average of two rf transitions frequencies in the metastable deuterium atom @xmath23 and @xmath24 contains no linear field - dependent terms and thus is rather insensitive to the field .",
    "still , the most important systematic effects contributing to the 20 hz error were the uncertainty in the determination of the magnetic field and the rf stark effect",
    ".    for an independent measurement of @xmath22 we use the hydrogen spectrometer setup described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a dye laser operating near 486 nm is locked to a definite tem@xmath25 mode of an ultra - stable cavity with ultra - low expansion ( ule ) glass spacer and a drift less than 0.5 hz / s ( fig.[fig1a ] ) .",
    "to change the laser frequency with respect to the cavity mode we use a broadband double - pass acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) placed between the laser and the cavity .",
    "the frequency of the dye laser is doubled in a barium @xmath26-borate crystal , and the resulting 243 nm radiation is coupled to a linear enhancement cavity inside the vacuum chamber where the two - photon excitation takes place .",
    "@xmath13 deuterium spectroscopy.,width=50 ]    atomic deuterium produced in a 15 w , 2.5 ghz rf gas discharge flows through teflon tubes to a copper nozzle cooled by a flow - through cryostat ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "atoms thermalize with the nozzle walls and leave the nozzle in both directions coaxially with the enhancement cavity mode .",
    "a part of the atoms flying along the mode are excited to the @xmath13 state and then reach the detection zone where a weak electrical quenching field is applied .",
    "the field mixes the @xmath13 and @xmath27 states of the atoms causing their fast decay to the ground state with the emission of lyman@xmath28 photons .",
    "photons are counted by a solar - blind photomultiplier connected to a photon counter incorporated into time - of - flight measurement scheme .",
    "the excitation radiation is periodically blocked before the cavity by a chopper wheel , and 121 nm photons are detected only within a 3 ms dark time interval . introducing a delay @xmath29 between closing the beam and starting the detection , we can thus select different velocity groups contributing to the signal .",
    "the delay @xmath29 sets an upper limit for the atomic velocity to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the distance between the nozzle and detector . using a multi - channel scaler we sort the counts in adjacent time bins ( @xmath32 , ) and simultaneously record up to 12 spectra containing the information about velocity - dependent effects , e.g. 2nd order doppler effect .    here",
    "we will point out some important changes which have been introduced in the spectrometer configuration ( which has been used for the recent measurements in atomic hydrogen @xcite ) to optimize it for the current deuterium measurement . to maximize the count rate for slow atoms ( @xmath33 m / s ) one has to find a compromise between thermalization and recombination processes at the cold walls of the nozzle by adjusting the nozzle geometry and temperature .",
    "the best rates are observed with a larger nozzle diameter ( 22.5 mm compared to 1.2 mm for hydrogen ) and at slightly higher temperatures ( 66.5 k compared to 5 k ) .",
    "typically , the count rate with the deuterium beam has been higher than for hydrogen ( by a factor 25 depending on @xmath29 ) .        on the way between the gas discharge and the nozzle we have installed a bypass valve which can be opened to a high - vacuum ( hv ) part of the vacuum chamber , where the cavity mirrors ,",
    "the nozzle and the detector have been placed . by opening the valve",
    "we reduce the atomic flow through the nozzle by a factor of 4 . even at the lowest pressure in the gas discharge ( 0.7 mbar ) and with opened valve ,",
    "the count rate was sufficient to detect a solid @xmath13 signal for the atoms with @xmath33 m / s .",
    "the high - vacuum volume is pumped by a turbo - molecular pump to @xmath34 mbar .",
    "atoms are collimated by two 1.5 mm diaphragms separating the hv and the ultrahigh - vacuum ( uhv ) volumes .",
    "most of the interaction region ( 95% ) is in the uhv region pumped by a @xmath35 l / s cryopump . without the atomic beam ,",
    "the background gas pressure in the uhv region equals @xmath36 mbar .",
    "the background gas pressure increases with the deuterium flow escaping from the nozzle and can be thus varied up to @xmath37 mbar .",
    "the excitation region is shielded against external magnetic fields . as in @xcite",
    ", we use a two - stage @xmath38metal shielding . the outer shielding together with the compensation field reduces residual fields over the entire interaction region to 1020 mg .",
    "configuration of the inner shielding has been improved to increase the shielding factor as well as its throughput for pumping .     and @xmath13 levels in atomic deuterium .",
    "the splitting of magnetic sublevels in a magnetic field is also presented.,width=50 ]    in the absence of magnetic fields , the @xmath13 hfs interval frequency is given by the following combination of optical frequencies and the ground state hfs interval : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the frequencies of the doublet and the quadruplet transitions at 121 nm ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . in our experiment",
    ", we measure the frequency difference @xmath42 using two - photon spectroscopy of the corresponding transitions .",
    "the frequency of the ground - state splitting has been measured by wineland and ramsey @xcite with an uncertainty of @xmath43 : @xmath44 the contribution to the resulting error budget introduced by this uncertainty is negligible .    for allowed two - photon transitions between the levels with @xmath45 , the contribution of the linear zeeman effect cancels and the hfs frequency shift in a magnetic field @xmath46 scales as @xmath47 which is unfavorable for deuterium in comparison to hydrogen .",
    "but due to a low - field regime and the absence of linear terms , our measurement is rather insensitive to magnetic fields . in our case ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath46 shifts the frequency @xmath48 approximately as @xmath49 khz / g@xmath50 .     corresponding to the centers of the doublet and quadruplet transition lines ( bootom ) .",
    "the frequency change is due to the drift of the reference ule cavity ( bottom ) . ,",
    "width=60 ]    the laser as well as the lock electronic are adjusted in such a way , that the two @xmath51 ( doublet ) @xmath52 ( quadruplet ) transitions can be excited by changing the aom frequency ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . to measure the frequency difference between the two two - photon transitions we have applied the following procedure .",
    "the frequency of the double - pass aom placed between the reference ule cavity and the laser is tuned to one of the transitions and one point of the spectrum is measured with a photon accumulation time of 0.5 s. after the measurement , the aom frequency @xmath53 is sweeped over a big fixed frequency interval ( approximately equals to @xmath54/8\\approx36 $ ] mhz ) to reach the other two - photon transition . during the sweep , the laser has been continuously kept in lock .",
    "the factor 8 arises from the double - pass scheme for the aom , the second harmonic generation stage and the two - photon process . than we introduce 0.5 s pause as recovery time for multiple feedbacks , and repeat the measurement of one point of the other two - photon transition .",
    "after the measurement we add a small frequency step for scan and sweep the synthesizer back to the first transition .",
    "the result of such a procedure is presented on fig.[fig3](top ) .",
    "the rf synthesizer driving the aom is continuously referenced to the 10 mhz signal of a hp5071a cesium frequency standard calibrated by gps ( fig.[fig1a ] ) .",
    "the miscalibration of the primary standard introduces a negligible uncertainty to the measured difference .",
    "after the double - pass aom , the laser light is spatially filtered by means of a single - mode fiber , while the intensity of the light coupled into the cavity is actively stabilized .",
    "that guarantees that the coupling conditions which can change the frequency of the reference cavity mode @xcite are the same for both transitions .",
    "both simultaneously recorded doublet and quadruplet transition lines are fitted with a lorentzian function in the time and frequency domains .",
    "a typical time interval between the centers of such a line pair is less than 5 s. this corresponds to some small correction on a level of a few hertz which should be introduced to correct for the reference cavity drift ( fig.[fig3](bottom ) ) .",
    "such a procedure significantly reduces the influence of reference cavity frequency fluctuations on the @xmath13 hfs data statistics .",
    "the new method suppresses the influence coming from all drifts in the experimental setup with a time scale exceeding 200 s which is required to record one line .",
    "even though such fluctuations do not introduce systematic shifts , a long time is required to average them .",
    "the approach is much more forgiving to systematic effects : one independent point is obtained after 3 minutes of measurement , while for the previous method @xcite the corresponding time interval was about 20 minutes .",
    "we have measured @xmath55 during 7 days using the new method and during 6 days applying the method described in @xcite . to test for systematic effects",
    "we have varied different parameters of the experiment within each day .",
    "we have recorded over 1000 deuterium time - resolved spectra .",
    "the averaged amplitude ratio between quadruplet and doublet transitions equals to 2.00(2 ) which is in a good agreement with theoretical expectation .",
    "the systematic effects for our two - photon beam spectroscopy are well - known @xcite . for the differential measurement ,",
    "the most significant effects cancel out .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the differential dynamic stark shift cancels to the level of @xmath56 relative to the shift of the @xmath14@xmath13 transition ( about 500 hz ) . because of some residual fluctuations of the 243 nm radiation intensity , the doublet and quadruplet lines acquire slightly different shifts .",
    "we correct for this difference for each line by monitoring the power leaking out of the cavity ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the resulting correction for the new method equals 0.5 hz which is a factor 4 lower than for the measurement in hydrogen @xcite . for the simultaneous recording technique , long - term intensity fluctuations in the enhancement cavity contribute less to the result than in the case of @xcite .",
    "besides the correction , we add a 0.5 hz uncertainty to the error budget .",
    "a dc electrical field @xmath57 mixes @xmath13 and @xmath27 levels causing a @xmath13 level shift . according to @xcite , the energy shift of the @xmath13 level is reversely proportional to the lamb shift .",
    "thus , the differential shift scales as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the lamb shift of the @xmath13 level .",
    "the evaluated shift of the @xmath13 hfs interval in deuterium equals @xmath60 @xmath61 hz cm@xmath50/v@xmath50 and is about 4 times smaller as in hydrogen .",
    "the excitation region is shielded from stray fields by coating all surrounding parts of the interaction region with graphite .",
    "residual stray fields in the setup are estimated to be less than 30 mv / cm @xcite , which corresponds to a @xmath13 hfs frequency shift on a level of @xmath63 hz .",
    "we add an uncertainty of 0.5 hz to the error budget considering the slightly worse geometrical properties of our shielding compared to the faraday cage used in @xcite .",
    "residual magnetic fields split the magnetic sublevels and shift the measured hyperfine splitting to higher values .",
    "the shift mostly originates from imperfectly shielded parts of the excitation region lying in the hv region ( fig.[fig2 ] ) . to check for this effect",
    "we have once made a set of measurements without compensation field and observed a change of @xmath64 equal to 20(22 ) hz . without compensation field , the measured value of magnetic fields around the nozzle and the detector is about 200 mg .",
    "the compensation field reduces the magnetic fields for at least a factor of 10 , which means that the residual shift should be on a sub - hertz level .",
    "we conservatively estimate the shift as 0.5(1.0 ) hz .",
    "another source for level shifts is a pressure shift caused by collisions with the background gas and within the beam itself .",
    "the ground - state hyperfine splitting in hydrogen and deuterium is rather insensitive to collisions .",
    "typically , this shift is on a level of 1 hz / mbar depending on the buffer gas @xcite which corresponds to a vanishing shift for our pressure range . on the other side ,",
    "there are no reliable experimental data for the pressure shift of the @xmath13 hfs frequency @xcite .",
    "the upper limit for the @xmath13 hfs frequency shift can be taken as the frequency shift of the @xmath65 transition equal to @xmath66 mhz / mbar @xcite .",
    "but considering the theoretical works @xcite , there is no reason to expect the @xmath13 hfs shift to be orders of magnitude higher than for the ground state .",
    "hfs frequency vs. deuterium flow .",
    "one unit corresponds to @xmath67 particles coming to the nozzle per second .",
    "the data is obtained using the simultaneous recording method and corresponds to the delay time of @xmath68s . to extrapolate to the zero flow we fit the data with a linear function ( solid line).,width=75 ]    [ b ]    c @  c @   c @   c    ' '' ''    @xmath69 , @xmath70s ] & @xmath71 , [ m / s ] & @xmath72 , [ hz ] & @xmath73 , [ hz / a.u . ]",

    "most of the collisions take place within the atomic beam where the pressure can be much higher than the background gas pressure . using the method of simultaneous detection , we have varied the atomic flow over a wide range by changing the pressure in the gas discharge ( between 0.8 mbar and 8 mbar ) and by opening the bypass valve ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the background gas pressure scales linearly with the flow with a small offset of @xmath36 mbar .",
    "experimental data are presented in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "each point represents the result of statistical averaging of multiple data points detected at different days .",
    "about 1/4 of all the data have been taken at the lowest pressure in the gas discharge with an opened valve ( the left point ) . at high flows",
    "the slow atoms are accelerated and pushed away from the beam by collisions ( zacharias effect ) @xcite which causes a loss in statistics and corresponding increase of uncertainty . moreover ,",
    "the measurement time becomes restricted by a fast growth of a film of molecular deuterium on the nozzle .",
    "for the previous method @xcite the flow range of @xmath75-@xmath76 ( fig.[fig4 ] ) is practically unreachable . disregarding the delay time @xmath77",
    "we have not observed any indication for a @xmath13 hfs interval pressure shift on our level of accuracy .",
    "the observed transition lines are shifted by the second order doppler effect in a range between 0.11 khz depending on the velocity distribution of the atoms contributing to the signal @xcite .",
    "the lines are not symmetric and significantly differ from lorentzian profiles at short ( @xmath78 ) delays ( fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
    "if we excite two - photon transitions in the same thermal beam and detect the signal with some precisely defined delay time @xmath29 equal for both singlet and quadruplet transitions , the shift and the influence of the asymmetry should cancel out . to estimate the possible uncertainty coming form the `` wrong '' fitting procedure with a lorentzian function and all other velocity - dependent effects , we have evaluated the @xmath64 frequency for different delays .",

    "the corresponding uncertainty grows due to the lack of statistics . as a final value we have chosen the result @xmath79 ( @xmath80 @xmath38s ) due to the following reasons : ( i ) the statistical uncertainty for this result is small , ( ii ) the line - profile is practically undistinguishable from lorentzian , and ( iii ) the fast non - thermalized atoms",
    "do not contribute to the signal .",
    "we add an additional uncertainty of 0.3 hz corresponding to the conservatively estimated shift coming from the collisions with the residual background gas .",
    "the data obtained during 6 days of measurement applying the older method presented in @xcite give the result of @xmath81 hz . the data are measured only at low deuterium flows @xmath82@xmath83 and are simply averaged over the entire ensemble .",
    "we have increased the uncertainty due to the possible pressure shift ( 1 hz ) and the ac stark shift ( 2 hz ) .    combining both these statistically independent results and adding all known systematic uncertainties linearly , we arrive at the final value for the @xmath13 hyperfine interval in atomic deuterium @xmath84 this result is in a good agreement with the one obtained by an rf method @xcite , but is more accurate by a factor 3 .",
