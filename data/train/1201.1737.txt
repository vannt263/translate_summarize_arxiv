    "the discovery of graphene @xcite , a one - atom thick material of carbon atoms , has made a great impact not only on condensed matter physics but also on particle physics @xcite .",
    "it gives a realization of massless quasiparticles in a material easy to create and observe , since the valence band and the conduction band of the electrons touch at two independent `` dirac points '' in the brillouin zone with the conical shape @xcite . due to this `` dirac cone '' structure , there can be seen several unconventional behaviors characteristic to monolayer graphene , such as the high mobility of charge carriers and the half - integer quantum hall effect . since these charged quasiparticles obey the dirac equation around half filling , they are described as massless dirac fermions in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional plane , as an effective field theory @xcite .",
    "such an effective field description also has some connections to the high energy physics side , such as lattice fermion formulation @xcite , deformation - induced gauge fields @xcite and the existence of vortex zero modes @xcite .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction between electrons is one of the most important problems in graphene physics @xcite . since the coulomb interaction strength in graphene",
    "is effectively enhanced by the inverse of the fermi velocity @xmath0 from the ordinary quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , it is beyond the treatment of perturbative expansion unless the interaction is screened by dielectric substrates such as silicon oxides ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "if the interaction is sufficiently strong , the electron and hole may form an exciton condensate , which may give a finite gap in the band structure of graphene .",
    "this scenario is analogous to the dynamical mass generation of fermions in strongly coupled gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , where the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry leads to the dynamical mass gap of the fermions @xcite . in the effective field theory of graphene",
    ", the chiral symmetry of the fermions corresponds to the inversion symmetry between two triangular sublattices of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "owing to such an analogy , there have been several studies on the `` chiral symmetry breaking '' in monolayer graphene with the techniques commonly used in the studies on qcd .",
    "dyson equation @xcite , @xmath2 expansion @xcite , and the exact renormalization group approach @xcite have been applied to the effective field theory of monolayer graphene .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the effective square lattice model have been performed to obtain the critical value of the coupling constant and the equation of state around the critical point @xcite .",
    "the author has treated the system as a strongly coupled u(1 ) lattice gauge theory by the strong coupling expansion , which is one of the methods to investigate the non - perturbative features of the strongly coupled gauge theories like qcd @xcite , and has obtained the behavior of the ( pseudo-)nambu  goldstone mode related to the chiral symmetry breaking in the low energy region @xcite .    in graphene , however , there may be other ordering patterns than the sublattice ( chiral ) symmetry breaking that may open a finite spectral gap , due to the honeycomb lattice structure @xcite .",
    "kekul distortion , which is described by the alternating pattern of the bond strengths like in the benzene molecule @xcite , is one of those ordering patterns without breaking the sublattice symmetry .",
    "it can be induced externally by the effect of some substrates @xcite or adatoms on the layer @xcite . in the author s",
    "previous work , it has been found that sufficiently large external kekul distortion may restore the sublattice symmetry which has been spontaneously broken in the strong coupling limit of the coulomb interaction @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there has been an argument that the kekul distortion may appear spontaneously as a result of the electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "it is currently a great challenge what order may appear in the vacuum - suspended graphene due to the effectively strong coulomb interaction . in order to treat the ordering patterns characteristic to the honeycomb lattice exactly",
    ", the analysis of the effective field theory preserving the honeycomb structure is required @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the competition between two phases , the sublattice symmetry broken ( slsb ) phase and the kekul distortion ( kd ) phase , by using an effective fermion model of graphene keeping the original honeycomb lattice structure .",
    "this model , motivated by the strong coupling expansion of u(1 ) lattice gauge theory defined on the honeycomb lattice , includes the on - site interaction and the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction .",
    "if the on - site interaction is dominant , the slsb of the honeycomb lattice takes place . on the other hand , if the interaction between nearest neighboring sites is relatively strong , there appears two types of spontaneous kekul distortion ( kd1 and kd2 ) , without breaking the sublattice symmetry . by analyzing the mean - field free energy of the the effective fermion model",
    ", we derive the phase diagram and phase boundary separating the three phases , slsb , kd1 and kd2 .",
    "a finite gap in the spectrum of the electrons can be induced in any of the three phases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we construct u(1 ) lattice gauge theory on the honeycomb lattice starting from the conventional tight binding hamiltonian coupled with the electromagnetic field as compact u(1 ) link variables . in section [ sec : expansion ] , we derive the interaction terms between fermions by using the strong coupling expansion techniques of the u(1 ) lattice gauge theory up to the next - to leading order @xcite .",
    "two characteristic interactions are induced ; the on - site interaction which favors slsb , and the nn interaction which favors kd .",
    "we take an effective fermion model including these two interaction terms . in the next two sections ,",
    "we take the effective fermion model as it is and investigate the phase structure by varying the strength of the on - site and nn interactions , to study the interplay between these different orders . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we investigate the phase structure qualitatively by taking two characteristic cases ; on - site dominance and nn dominance . phase diagram with slsb , kd1 and kd2 phases are also drawn qualitatively . in section [ sec : numerical ] , we confirm the the phase diagram in the previous section numerically by minimizing the mean - field free energy of the effective fermion model .",

    "treats several types of instabilities by the exact renormalization group method on the honeycomb lattice , and shows that only four instabilities , slsb , kd , sdw and qah , may occur by the effect of the coulomb interaction , but the competition among these orders is left for further investigation .",
