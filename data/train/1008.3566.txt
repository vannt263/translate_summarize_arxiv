    "recent work indicates that exoplanets , and especially jupiter class planets at a distance @xmath1 au from their parent stars ( the so called _ hot jupiters _ ) , are in a unique x - ray environment and the effects of stellar x - rays may be significant to their evolution .",
    "the x - rays have been cited as the cause of excess heating of the planet , which can induce mass loss @xcite .",
    "further , it has been argued that the magnetic fields of the star and the planet can interact when the latter is orbiting at a distance of very few stellar radii as in the case of hd  189733@xcite .",
    "the complex magnetosphere that is formed by the star+planet system can drag material from the outer atmosphere of the planet and funnel it onto the stellar surface .",
    "the accretion of gas on the star that eventually could arise from this phenomenon can provoke shocks that heats the plasma up to a few million of degree and thus emits in x - rays .",
    "furthermore , the enhanced magnetic field near the stellar surface can form very active regions on the star increasing the activity of the star in the x - ray band .",
    "recent statistical analysis of x - ray activity of stars possessing hot - jupiters indicates that stars with close orbiting planets show enhanced x - ray emission @xcite . in the optical band ,",
    "@xcite have detected enhanced activity of ca h  &  k in phase with planet s orbital period in hd  179949 .",
    "a typical  hot jupiter \" receives @xmath2 times more radiation from its star than jupiter does from the sun , and orbits at a distance of only @xmath310 stellar radii . unlike solar system planets , where residual heat from formation and gravitational settling still plays an important part in the energy budgets of jupiter and other giant planets ,",
    "the energy budget for hot jupiters is completely dominated by the strong radiation that they receive from their parent stars .",
    "this energy budget is poorly constrained in the x - ray and uv regimes by standard stellar atmosphere models .",
    "thus , understanding the nature of this input and the planet - star interactions is essential for understanding the properties and the evolution of these planets . as pointed by @xcite ,",
    "the stellar x - ray and uv fluxes in their irradiance calculations strongly determine the amount of losses of gas from the outer atmospheres of close - in exoplanets , otherwise the losses of volatiles in models neglecting uv/ x - ray irradiation are proved to be unrealistically low . the uv / x - ray flux from the star plays a crucial role in determining the photochemistry of the planet s upper atmosphere .",
    "the photo - chemical products can act , in turn , as high - altitude absorbers , create thermal inversions , and otherwise alter the observable properties of the planet s upper atmosphere .",
    "these effects are important when observing at lower energies / longer wavelengths ( @xcite , @xcite ) hd  189733  ( r.a .",

    "it is in a wide binary system and hd  189733b , the other stellar member of the binary system , is a m4v type star ( with range : m3.5m5 , @xmath8 , @xcite ) orbiting at a mean distance of @xmath9 au ( 12.3@xmath10 apparent separation ) with a period of 3200  yr in a plane nearly perpendicular to the earth - hd  189733a line of sight .",
    "it is thought that the age of this system is greater than or equal to 0.6 gyr @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is estimated of a few tens of gauss , a toroidal component and higher multipole components are presumed and a strong shear of field lines due to differential rotation is inferred @xcite .",
    "hd  189733a hosts a jupiter size planet ( hd  189733b , @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) at a distance of only 0.031 au ( 8.75 stellar radii ) and with an orbital period of 2.219d @xcite , much lower than the stellar rotational period .",

    "planet type .",
    "the orbit is nearly circular and orbital plane is parallel within a few degrees of the earth - primary line of sight .",
    "this system has been the subject of many studies since its discovery , given its close distance and favorable geometry . given q - values for giant planets in the solar system , it is thought that orbital radii of a few hundredths of an au from parent star reduces hot jupiters tidal dissipation timescales to a few myr , and tidally locked hot jupiters should be the norm . under this hypothesis",
    ", hd  189733b should show a pronounced temperature difference between the day - side and the night - side hemispheres .",
    "instead @xcite found only a modest difference of temperature between day - side and night - side hemispheres , suggesting that the thermal energy transport and thermalization in the planet s atmosphere is quite efficient .",
    "the same study shows that a bright spot is present in the planet surface displaced by @xmath14 east longitude with respect to the sub - stellar point .",
    "observations with acs camera on  board _ hubble _ allowed @xcite to infer that planet transits cover spots on the stellar surface with sizes of order of 80000 km .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed two x - ray observations of hd  189733a : the first obtained during a planetary transit on april 17 2007 and the second during a planetary eclipse occurred on may 18 2009 .",
    "here we discuss the features observed in the light curve of 2009 and we relate them to possible effects of interaction of the planet and the host star .",
    "the first feature we have observed in 2009 is a _ softening _ of the emission during the planet eclipse at a level of @xmath92 .",
    "although similar variations of the spectrum hardness are seen in the light curve , this softening has a direct correspondence with the eclipse timing and , in addiction , during the eclipse the star has the softest emission even recorded in both 2007 and 2009 observations .",
    "the mean pi in epic - pn in the 0.31.5  kev band is @xmath93  ev before the eclipse and after the flare that occur post - eclipse , while it is @xmath94  ev at the mid eclipse .",
    "an analogy between hd  189733b and jupiter here may be appropriate .",
    "jupiter shows enhanced soft emission in x - rays coming from the equatorial region and due to the interaction of solar x - rays with the upper atmosphere of the planet @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a harder x - ray emission is detected near the poles of jupiter and may be due to charge exchange mechanisms caused by precipitating ions of carbon , sulfur and oxygen @xcite .",
    "the flux in 0.2 - 7 kev coming from jupiter aurorae is @xmath95 erg s@xmath31 @xmath32 that corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath96 erg s@xmath31 .  by using simple scaling , taking into account the star - planet distance in hd  189733 ,",
    "the higher luminosity of the star with respect to the sun ( @xmath97 ) and the distance to hd  189733  we estimate that the power emitted by aurorae would be @xmath98 erg s@xmath31 , corresponding to a flux to earth of @xmath99 , which is too faint to be detected by xmm - newton , unless there are additional sources of energy caused by the magnetic field topology . if the softening is related to the secondary eclipse it can not be related to a scaled emission of jupiter for the case of hd  189733b . with only one observation",
    "we are not in the position to assess that the softening is related to the secondary eclipse .",
    "a series of observations at the same phase would reveal if the softening is systematically recurrent .",
    "the second relevant feature present in the light curve of 2009 is the most intense flare recorded in both observations , occurring @xmath33  ks after the secondary eclipse .",
    "the increase of flux is equal to @xmath385% of the emission before the eclipse and the plasma temperature shows a modest heating passing from @xmath30.4 kev prior to the event to @xmath51 kev .",
    "the properties of the flare like temperature , luminosity , decay rate are similar to other flares observed in solar type stars without hot jupiters . during the flare",
    "the lines of ovii at @xmath100 are more luminous than before and after the event .",
    "the ovii complex remains in excess with respect to the best fit model of the flare spectrum .",
    "high resolution rgs spectra show that the @xmath61 ovii line remain quite luminous after the event and the @xmath60 line almost disappears .    during its cooling phase ,",
    "we see several impulsive events ( see fig .",
    "[ smoothed ] ) .",
    "it is as though there are multiple small flares occurring as the overall structure is cooling .",
    "the faster decay time would imply loops smaller than the main flaring loop .",
    "a peculiar characteristic of the small impulses is that the rate increases while the median pi steadily decreases .",
    "one way to understand this is to imagine that the flare occurred close to the limb , and at least in occurrence of such events the corresponding part of the corona was emerging into view . if our interpretation of this evidence is correct , then the flare is occurring on the limb when the planet is at phase approximately 0.54 .",
    "this would put the flare displaced by @xmath101 and the meeting the sub planetary point ( see figure [ geometry ] ) .",
    "given the timing of the flare one could speculate that the coronal region where it took place could be displaced by @xmath102 and trailing the sub - planetary point .",
    "the presence of spots and active regions on the stellar surface rotating synchronously with the planet have been reported in literature in stars with hot jupiters . @xcite and @xcite report that hd  179949 and",
    "@xmath103  and show variability of chromospheric activity indicators phased with planet rotation hinting thus the presence hot spots rotating synchronously with the planet as a consequence of star - planet interaction .",
    "the spots are displaced with respect to the sub - planetary point by + 70@xmath15 and -170@xmath15 respectively .",
    "analogously to solar corona these spots should be the chromospheric footpoints of coronal loops .",
    "@xcite has suggested also some excess of flaring activity on hd  189733  in phase with the planet rotation superimposed to the main long lasting active regions on the stellar surface .",
    "one speculative hypothesis is that the large flare we have observed could arise from active regions for which the activity is triggered by the complex magnetic interaction that should be present between the star and the planet . in summary , we can not draw a conclusion on this point with only one observation . as in the case of the softening",
    ", a series of further observations around the secondary eclipse could establish the systematic recurrence of high activity just after the end of the eclipse and coming from active regions triggered by star - planet interaction .",
    "@xcite proposed an analytical model for the stellar magnetic field in the case of spi .",
    "this model was aimed to explain the phase shifts of active regions with respect to the sub - planetary point observed . with a suitable choice of the model parameters",
    "the author shows that this simple model can reproduce these phase shifts for hd  189733 hd 179949 , @xmath104  and and @xmath105 bootis .",
    "the prediction from this model for the case of hd  189733  is that a phase shift between sub - planetary point and active region should be @xmath106 . with the same model",
    "@xcite has addressed the energy budget , the intermittent nature of the visibility of spots and the effect that could be seen in radio and x - ray bands . from a qualitative point of view",
    "the stellar magnetic field should be able to drag material evaporating from the planet and to deposit it in a azimuthal flux rope in the outer part of the corona .",
    "this region should be the site of an enhanced x - ray activity due to magnetic reconnection ( see fig .",
    "[ geometry ] for a simple schematic ) . by comparing our observational results to this model ,",
    "we observe that the large flare in 2009 can fit consistently with this model and the excess of flaring activity suggested by @xcite under the hypothesis that it come from active regions displaced by @xmath107 with respect to the sub - planetary point .",
    "we have carried out preliminary mhd simulations of the star+planet system within the dipolar field setup ( `` case a '' ) of @xcite , but with the stellar and planetary parameters of the hd 189733 system .",
    "the planetary magnetic field is taken to be half that of jupiter ( with an equatorial field of 2 g ) ; this is a reasonable assumption since tidal effects will have reduced the planetary rotation compared to that of jupiter .",
    "figure [ mhd ] shows one frame of the time evolution of the magnetic field of hd  189733a+b system based on our mhd simulation .",
    "the simplified dipole model produces a density enhancement in the intervening interplanetary medium that is threaded by complex magnetic fields .",
    "there is thus a greater potential to observe transients occurring in this region .",
    "the density enhancement is formed by plasma trapped into closed magnetic field lines that would have been opened in the absence of the planet interaction .    in summary , we find elements of consistency between the observed features in x - ray band , optical chromospheric indicators and model predictions .",
    "the magnetic interaction of planet and host star can enhance the activity in some regions of the stellar surface and that probably these are among the most active regions of the star chromosphere and corona . as suggested by @xcite basing on chromospheric activity indicators , the spot activity can be enhanced or reduced due to the complex magnetic field evolution .",
    "this part of the star - planet interaction is observed as flares . on the day side of the planet , it is plausible that the interaction manifests itself as colliding wind from the star on to the inflated atmosphere and with polar aurorae that emit x - rays harder than the main coronal emission , although this emission remains too faint to be detected .",
    "although our data do not allow us to draw specific conclusions , they suggest that effects of the magnetic interaction between a star and a close planet could be detected in x - rays . a series of observations in the same phase range near the secondary eclipse and perhaps coordinated with optical observations of chromospheric activity indicators can allow to distinguish systematic effects caused by planet presence from random variability intrinsic to the coronal activity",
    ".      the age of hd  189733  has been estimated by @xcite to be greater than 0.6 gyr basing on indicators of chromospheric activity calibrated on normal main sequence stars .",
    "furthermore these authors reported a very low abundance of li ( a(li)@xmath108 ) in hd  189733a .",
    "for comparison in the sun a(li ) is @xmath109 at an age of 4.6  gyr .",
    "lithium is destroyed during main sequence phase because of convection that brings lithium in the inner layers of the star where at a temperature of 23 mk is burned .",
    "both li and chromospheric indicators are sensitive for ages @xmath110 gyr . in the case of hd  189733",
    "the use of chromospheric lines could be biased by the enhanced activity of the star itself and , eventually , by spi .",
    "our x - ray observation suggests a better constraint on its age .",
    "the non - detection of hd  189733b , a m4 spectral type star , at a level of @xmath111 erg s@xmath31 suggests an age estimate of hd  189733  older than the current one .",
    "m - type stars exhibit a decay of x - ray emission during main sequence phase slower than in g and k type stars due to the lower rate of dissipation of angular momentum and the link between rotation and dynamo efficiency . @xcite have studied a sample of low mass stars in the _ chandra deep field north_. in this sample m4 stars are characterized by @xmath112 erg s@xmath31 , and the age of the sample is presumed to be greater than 3  gyr . given the non - detection of hd  189733b we suggest that the age of this system could be tentatively estimated older than 2 gyr .    placing the system at an age of 2  gyr the x - ray luminosity of hd  189733   ( @xmath113 ) fits the trend observed from studies of x - ray luminosities and activity in k - type stars of open clusters and field stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite consider the age estimates from various indicators like ca h&k lines , a(li ) , rotation and x - ray emission , obtaining thus several relations between age and these observables . with a rotational period of @xmath114d and a k1 type star , hd",
    "189733  would fit close to the age of hyades ( * ? ? ? * see their fig . 10 ) .",
    "but the value of @xmath115 reported by @xcite and the curves given by @xcite in their fig .",
    "12 would suggest an age of @xmath116 gyr .",
    "furthermore , u , v , w space motion components ( u = -8.6 km / s , v = -14.4 km / s , w = 015.9 km / s ) are not compatible with those of hyades moving group @xcite . in conclusion , although the determination of the age of an isolated star can be difficult and poorly constrained , the non - detection of the m type companion below @xmath117 hints an age of hd  189733  around 1.72 gyr .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the analysis and the interpretation of x - rays light curves and spectra that we have acquired during a secondary eclipse of the planet hd  189733b observed in 2009 with the xmm - newton satellite . for completeness",
    "we have also analyzed in a homogeneous way a previous observation taken in 2007 during a planetary transit on the same target .",
    "our group has carried also mhd simulations of the magnetic interaction between star and planet . from the observations",
    "we have estimated that the average x - ray flux of the star in 2009 ( @xmath118 erg s@xmath31 @xmath32 ) has been has been 45% higher than the average flux in 2007 .",
    "the light curve of 2007 shows impulsive variability which is considered quite usual for a k - type star quoted at an age of 1  gyr . during the planetary transit we do not observe spectral or rate variations timed with the transit .    in the light curve of 2009 observation we have observed a softening of the spectrum significant at a @xmath119 level during the secondary eclipse and the biggest flare recorded in both observations occurring 3  ks after the end of the planet eclipse .",
    "the softening is well phased with the planet eclipse .",
    "the median of the spectrum change from an average value of @xmath93 ev before and after the eclipse to @xmath120 ev at the eclipse center .",
    "the decay phase of the main flare in the light curve shows several superimposed minor ignitions perhaps occurring in the same region where the main flare took place .",
    "we have fitted the spectrum subtracted from the pre - flare spectrum with a mono - thermal apec model .",
    "the flare exhibits a average plasma temperature of 0.9 kev while the quiescent plasma temperature is around 0.5 kev .",
    "the rgs spectrum shows a variability of the relative strength of the lines of ovii triplet prior , during and after this flare .",
    "in particular we noticed the reduction of inter - combination and forbidden lines during the flare , and a bright forbidden line after the end of the flare .",
    "these two behaviors of the ovii triplet lines are explained as an increase of density in the flaring region during the ignition , and a persistent low density bright / hot plasma after the end of the flare . by using a simple model of cooling loop as in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we infer a size of the flaring region of order of the stellar radius . from @xmath121 scaling law @xcite we infer a magnetic field twice the strength of the solar one .    in order to explore the possibility that the planetary magnetosphere can directly affect the stellar coronal structure , we have conducted mhd simulations of a model of interacting magnetic fields with opposite alignment as in case a of @xcite . from these simulations we infer that due to the relative motion of the planet and the star the global magnetic field is distorted and has an enhanced probability of reconnection events that can occur on the space between planet and star .",
    "given the coupling of magnetic field and plasma , an enhanced plasma density is present around the planet and it forms a trail rotating synchronously with the planet .",
    "globally we find consistency between observations and predictions from mhd simulations , hinting that the overall activity could be enhanced by magnetic spi .",
    "hence , the age estimates of the system using activity indicators are suspect .",
    "currently the age of hd  189733  is estimated to be at least @xmath122 gyr .",
    "the m - type companion , hd  189733a , is not detected at a level of luminosity of @xmath123 erg s@xmath31 suggesting thus an age for the system older than 1.72  gyr .    we have also analyzed the spectrum of a x - ray source close to hd  189733  and brighter in 2007 than in 2009 .",
