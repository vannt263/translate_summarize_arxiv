    "turbulence remains one of the unsolved problems of classical physics .",
    "turbulence generates strong nonlinear interactions among the large number of modes of the system , which makes theoretical analysis of such flows highly intractable . using kolmogorov s theory of fluid turbulence",
    ", it can be shown that the degrees of freedom of a turbulent flow with reynolds number @xmath2 is @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "consequently , a numerical simulation of a turbulent flow with a moderate reynolds number of @xmath4 requires @xmath5 trillion grid points , which is impossible even on the most sophisticated supercomputer of today .    a low - dimensional model called _ shell model of turbulence _",
    "@xcite is reasonably successful in explaining certain features of turbulence , e.g. , it reproduces the kolmogorov s theory of fluid turbulence , as well as the experimentally observed intermittency corrections  @xcite . in a shell model",
    ", a single shell represents all the modes of a logarithmically - binned shell , hence the number of modes in a shell model is much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , a large reynolds number can be easily achieved in a shell model with 40 or more shells .",
    "a large body of work exists on the shell model of fluid turbulence .",
    "however , till date , there is no shell model for the stably stratified turbulence , and there is no convergence on the shell model for the convective turbulence .",
    "brandenburg  @xcite and mingshun and shida  @xcite , have constructed shell models for convective turbulence , namely rayleigh bnard convection , but their results are divergent ( to be discussed later ; also see  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a shell model that describes both stably stratified and convective turbulence ; we can go from one to the other with a change of sign in the density or temperature gradient .",
    "our shell model reproduces the numerical results of kumar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , according to which stably stratified turbulence exhibits bolgiano - obukhov scaling  @xcite , and convective turbulence shows kolmogorov scaling .",
    "we also observe the dual spectrum predicted by bolgiano  @xcite and obukhov  @xcite .",
    "buoyancy - induced turbulence  @xcite , often encountered in geophysics , astrophysics , atmospheric and solar physics , engineering , come in two categories : ( a ) stably stratified flows in which a lighter fluid is above a heavier fluid .",
    "these flows are stable because of their stable density stratification ; ( b ) convective flows in which a heavier ( or colder ) fluid is above a lighter ( or hotter ) fluid .",
    "such flow configurations are unstable , hence , the heavier fluid elements come down , and the lighter ones go up .",
    "the linear regimes of the above flow are easy to solve , and they yield gravity waves and convective instabilities respectively . however , the turbulent aspects of such flows are active areas of research .    for stably stratified turbulence ,",
    "bolgiano  @xcite and obukhov  @xcite first proposed a phenomenology , according to which for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is wavenumber , and @xmath8 is bolgiano wavenumber  @xcite ) , the kinetic energy ( ke ) spectrum @xmath9 , entropy spectrum @xmath10 , ke energy flux @xmath11 , and entropy flux @xmath12 are @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the velocity and temperature fluctuations respectively , @xmath16 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath17 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the ke and entropy dissipation rates respectively , and @xmath20 s are constants .",
    "the ke flux @xmath11 is forward , and it decreases with @xmath7 due to a conversion of kinetic energy to potential energy .",
    "this decrease @xmath11 causes a steepening in the kinetic energy spectrum to @xmath0 , compared to kolmogorov s classical @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "note that the stably stratified flows is also described in terms of density fluctuation @xmath21 , which leads to an equivalent description since @xmath22 .",
    "in convective turbulence , @xmath23 is referred to as the entropy , but in stably stratified turbulence , @xmath24 is called the potential energy .",
    "bolgiano  @xcite also showed that the buoyancy effects become somewhat insignificant in the wavenumber band @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dissipation wavenumber .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . the aforementioned scaling , @xmath0 for @xmath6 , and @xmath1 for @xmath25 ,",
    "is referred to as bolgiano - obukhov ( bo ) phenomenology . for convective turbulence ,",
    "in particular for the idealised version called rayleigh bnard convection ( rbc ) , procaccia and zeitak  @xcite , lvov  @xcite , lvov and falkovich  @xcite , and rubinstein  @xcite argued in favour of bo scaling .",
    "the numerical and experimental findings however are inconclusive  @xcite . in a recent numerical simulation , kumar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite analysed the above phenomenologies in a great detail .",
    "they showed that stably stratified turbulence under strong buoyancy exhibits @xmath0 energy spectrum , as predicted by bolgiano  @xcite and obukhov  @xcite .",
    "they observed that @xmath30 , thus corroborating the net conversion of kinetic energy to potential energy . for rbc ,",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath31 , which is interpreted as a conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy , opposite to that in stably stratified turbulence .",
    "as a result , for rbc , the ke flux @xmath11 increases marginally with @xmath7 , and ke exhibits an approximate kolmogorov spectrum @xmath1 , contrary to the earlier predictions  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results of kumar _",
    "_  @xcite are consistent with those of borue and orszag  @xcite .    the powerlaw regimes in kumar _",
    "@xcite simulations are somewhat narrow .",
    "also , they could not observe the dual spectrum of bo phenomenology , which may require much higher numerical resolution than @xmath32 . in this paper",
    ", we present a unified shell model of stably stratified and convective turbulence that overcomes some of the aforementioned limitations of the numerical simulations . for the unified shell model for the buoyancy driven flows , we assume that the fluid is subjected to a mean temperature gradient , @xmath33 , which is positive for a stably stratified flow ( cold below and hot above ) , and is negative for a convective flow ( hot below and cold above ) . here",
