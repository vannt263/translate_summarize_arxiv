    "persistent homology is a recent extension of the classical theory of homology ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "given a real - valued function on a topological space , it measures the importance of a homology class by monitoring when the class appears and when it disappears in the increasing sequence of sublevel sets .",
    "a technical requirement is that the function be _ tame _ , which means it has only finitely many homological critical values , and each sublevel set has finite rank homology groups .",
    "pairing up the births and deaths , and drawing each pair of values as a _ dot _ ( a point in the plane ) , we get a multiset which we refer to as the _ persistence diagram _ of the function .",
    "it is a combinatorial summary of the homological information contained in the sequence of sublevel sets .",
    "if we substitute reduced for standard homology groups , we get a slightly modified _",
    "reduced persistence diagram _ of the function . as between homology groups",
    ", we can observe relationships between persistence diagrams .",
    "a prime example is poincar duality , which says that the @xmath8-th and the @xmath9-th homology groups of an @xmath3-manifold are isomorphic .",
    "more precisely , this is true if homology is defined for field coefficients , which is what we assume throughout this paper .",
    "the extension to functions says that the diagram is symmetric with respect to reflection across the vertical axis ; see @xcite . here , we change the homological dimension of a dot from @xmath8 to @xmath10 whenever we reflect it across the axis .",
    "this paper contributes new relationships by extending alexander duality from spaces to functions .",
    "to state our results , we assume a perfect morse function , @xmath0 $ ] , which for the sphere has no critical points other than a minimum and a maximum , and a decomposition of the @xmath11-dimensional sphere into two subsets , @xmath1 , whose intersection is an @xmath3-manifold , @xmath2 .",
    "our first result says that the reduced persistence diagrams of @xmath4 restricted to @xmath5 and to @xmath6 are reflections of each other .",
    "we call this the land and water theorem",
    ". our second result relates land with shore .",
    "ignoring some modifications , it says that the persistence diagram of @xmath4 restricted to @xmath7 is the disjoint union of the diagram of @xmath4 restricted to @xmath5 and of its reflection .",
    "the modifications become unnecessary if we assume that the minimum and maximum of @xmath4 both belong to a common component of @xmath6 .",
    "we call this the euclidean shore theorem .    in the example that justifies the title of this paper , and the names of our theorems , we let @xmath5 be the planet earth , not including the water and the air . to a coarse approximation ,",
    "@xmath5 is homeomorphic to a @xmath12-ball , sitting inside the universe , which we model as a @xmath12-sphere , @xmath13 .",
    "the function we consider is the negative gravitational potential of the earth , which is defined on the entire universe .",
    "the sea is then a sublevel set of this function restricted to @xmath6 , which is the closure of @xmath14 . with these definitions ,",
    "our results relate the persistence diagram of the gravitational potential restricted to the earth with the shape of the sea as its water level rises .",
    "also , the euclidean shore theorem applies , unmodified , expanding the relationship to include the sea floor , which is swept out by the shoreline as the water level rises .",
    "besides developing the mathematical theory of persistent homology , there are pragmatic reasons for our interest in the extension of alexander duality to functions .",
    "persistence has fast algorithms , so that the bulk of the work is often in the construction of the space and the function for which we compute persistence . a point in case",

    "the subset @xmath5 of @xmath15 is a union of cells times time , whose boundary is a @xmath12-manifold .",
    "we can represent @xmath5 by a @xmath16-parameter family of alpha complexes , whose disjoint union has the same homotopy type ; see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * chapter iii ) .",
