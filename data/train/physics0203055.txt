    "small free clusters of atoms or molecules exhibit solid - like or liquid - like properties that differ from the properties of their bulk counterpart .",
    "it has been realized that the cluster structure ( microcrystalline or amorphous ) @xcite depends on the production method .",
    "clusters made of @xmath4 molecules ( @xmath5 ) have already been examined in some detail by several groups @xcite to establish the existence of various structures and transformations between them .",
    "some of the microcrystalline states coexist dynamically @xcite in a given temperature interval and those which are only locally stable phases disappear when the cluster size increases as was confirmed both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "those states correspond to a partial order of the molecular axes of symmetry .",
    "the system becomes completely orientationally ordered at very low temperatures .",
    "the transition rate between the ordered and disordered states can be retrieved from the potential energy surface ( pes ) of the system , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that clusters of the same numbers of @xmath0 or @xmath1 molecules exhibit different dynamics despite the same symmetry of the molecules .",
    "the reason is that the topography of pes in the case of @xmath1 clusters is shallower than that of @xmath0 clusters .    in the present study",
    "we explore the changes of the cluster pes due to the changes of the charge distribution in a single molecule .",
    "our hypothesis is that the molecular polarization is changed by using different production methods . in order to find out the influence of the charge changes on orientational order - disorder phase transitions we have simulated the temperature behavior of molecular clusters with the help of a constant energy molecular dynamics .",
    "the main feature of the intermolecular interaction is the dependence on the mutual orientations of the molecules .",
    "there are experimental indications that @xmath4 molecules can be considered as rigid octahedra to a reasonable extent .",
    "a small negative charge should be assigned to the fluorine atoms to account for the chemical bond @xcite .",
    "the intermolecular potential is presented as a sum of atom - atom interaction ( fluorine - fluorine , tellurium - tellurium , fluorine - tellurium ) to account for the orientational anisotropy :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 denote either a fluorine or a tellurium ( sulfur ) atom ; @xmath8 is the distance between an @xmath9-atom in the @xmath10 molecule and a @xmath11-atom in the @xmath10 molecule ; @xmath12 is the number of the molecules in the cluster .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 have been fitted to the experimental diffraction results , @xcite .",
    "the coulomb term accounts for the small negative charge @xmath2 assigned to the fluorine atoms and the positive charge carried by the central tellurium atom , @xmath15 = 6 @xmath2 , which ensures a neutral molecule at distances much larger than the molecular size .",
    "here we compare the temperature - driven transitions for the case of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where e is the electron charge .    the charge",
    "@xmath2 has been computed using lcao ( linear combinations of atomic orbitals ) with planar basic functions ( @xmath16 ) and gaussian basic functions ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the potential , eq.[potential ] , has been used to solve the classical equation of motion written in the hamiltonian form with the help of a constant - energy md method .",
    "the velocity - verlet @xcite algorithm with a time step of @xmath18 has been implemented .",
    "this is a step optimized in @xcite to satisfy the requirements for long md runs necessary to detect phase changes in a computer experiment .",
    "the heating ( cooling ) of the system is performed by velocity rescaling and consequent thermalization @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the thermal behavior of clusters consisting of 89 @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) molecules in the temperature interval ( 50 @xmath19 140 k ) .",
    "the clusters of @xmath0 molecules melt above 125k ( @xmath16 ) and 130k ( @xmath17 ) as is seen from the caloric curves in fig.[fig-1 ] , fig.[fig-2 ] and the lindemann criterion , fig.[fig-3 ] .",
    "the lindemann coefficient @xmath20 corresponds to a solid - like phase ( @xmath21 for bulk systems ) @xcite .",
    "melting is a discontinuous transition even in the case of nanosized clusters .",
    "the heating and cooling of clusters ( fig.[fig-1 ] ) demonstrate a hysteresis , which signals a discontinuous transition .",
    "the charge increase shifts the melting point towards higher temperature : in comparison to a cluster with less charged atoms , fig.[fig-2 ] .",
    "[ the larger charge , the more robust is the cluster ] .",
    "the hysteresis area is larger for the case of @xmath17 than for @xmath16 .",
    "one could speculate about a `` larger memory '' in systems having a `` larger charge '' .",
    "another important distinction between less and more charged fluorine atoms is the structure adopted by the clusters below the freezing point .",
    "the distributions @xmath22 of the mutual molecular orientations with @xmath16 , fig.[fig-4 ] , show that they transform step by step from liquid to a partially ordered solid ( phase a ) to an ordered solid ( phase b ) .",
    "the clusters with @xmath17 , fig.[fig-5 ] , transform directly from liquid to an ordered state .",
    "the radial distribution g(r ) @xcite , fig.[fig-6 ] , is a diagnostic of the lattice structure adopted by clusters .",
    "we compute g(r ) for the molecular center of masses which is insensitive to the molecular orientations .",
    "fig.[fig-6 ] was obtained as follows : starting from a low - temperature configuration obtained from simulations of a cluster with @xmath16 , we change to @xmath17 and heat the cluster until it melts .",
    "then the cluster is cooled to a solid state .",
    "g(r ) are plotted at the same @xmath23 on the cooling and heating branch .",
    "the structures are obviously different .",
    "typical configurations obtained by quenching @xcite of the md trajectory are shown in fig.[fig-7 ] [ ( a ) - for @xmath16 ; ( b ) - for @xmath17 ] . in both cases",
    "we obtain two orientations populated by the molecules but the arrangements of `` layers '' in the clusters are different .",
    "we conclude that the charge change influences both the melting temperature and structural transformations .",
    "meta - stable solid states with partial order disappear for the case of larger charge .",
    "the volume of the cluster decreases when the charge increases and the cluster is more robust on heating .",
    "our results show that the charge increase shifts the transitions temperature towards higher values and some of the metastable states disappear .",
    "this confirms our understanding that the repulsive interaction maintains the order in molecular systems .",
