    "the recent surge in activity in hadron spectroscopy and , i suppose , the main motivation for the formation of the topical group on hadron physics , is the result of renewed interest in a rather old question : _ are there hadronic states with a more complex structure than the simple @xmath10 mesons and @xmath11 baryons of the original quark model _ ?",
    "this revival of interest has been driven by experimental reports of pentaquarks  @xcite , the narrow @xmath12 states  @xcite , and the @xmath13  @xcite .    in spite of considerable theoretical and experimental effort ,",
    "the existence of non-@xmath10 mesons and/or non-@xmath11 baryons remains an open question .",
    "while the identification of a strangeness=+1 ( or charm=-1 ) baryon would be definitive evidence for a non-@xmath11 baryon , the experimental situation regarding the existence of such states remains unsettled ( and a major topic of discussion at this meeting  @xcite ) . on the other hand , while the @xmath12 and and @xmath13 are experimentally well established , the theoretical interpretation is not so clear .",
    "the @xmath14 states could be standard @xmath15-wave @xmath16 states and their narrowness is only surprising because the relativistic potential model calculations that predicted them to be heavier ( and above @xmath17 threshold ) are wrong  @xcite .",
    "some theorists , including our opening speaker  @xcite , remain hopeful that a @xmath18 charmonium assignment can be found for the @xmath13 .",
    "to sort this all out , i think that the so - called hidden charm mesons can and will play a decisive role for reasons that include :    * the theory for these systems is well founded ( and recently blessed by this year s nobel prize committee ) and has fewest ambiguities ; * the experimental signatures tend to be clean ; * @xmath18 meson states below open - charm threshold are narrow and do not overlap ; and * lots of non-@xmath18-type mesons have been conjectured , including @xmath19 molecules  @xcite and @xmath18-@xmath20 hybrids  @xcite .    although the belle detector  @xcite is specialized to studies of cp violation in @xmath21 meson decays , it has proven to be a useful device for studying particles containing @xmath18 pairs",
    ". belle detects @xmath18 systems produced via weak decays of @xmath22 quarks the @xmath23 process is a dominant @xmath22-quark decay mode and the continuum production process @xmath24 , which has been found to be surprisingly large .",
    "the kekb asymmetric energy @xmath8 collider  @xcite operates at a center - of - mass ( cms ) energy corresponding to the @xmath9 resonance and routinely delivers luminosities that are in excess of @xmath25@xmath26s@xmath7 , thereby providing belle with a huge data sample that contains about 300 million @xmath27 meson pair events and over one billion @xmath28 continuum annihilation events .",
    "belle results in the hidden charm meson sector include first observations of :    * the @xmath29 via the sequence @xmath30 , @xmath31  @xcite ; * anomalously large cross sections for the exclusive process @xmath32 and the inclusive process @xmath33  @xcite ; * the @xmath13 meson  @xcite ; * a near - threshold @xmath0 mass enhancement in exclusive @xmath34 decays  @xcite ; and * a peak at 3940  mev in the @xmath5 recoil mass spectrum in the inclusive @xmath6 process  @xcite .    in this talk i will discuss the last two items as well as recent results on properties of the @xmath13 .",

    "the fit gives a breit - wigner signal yield of @xmath77 events with a peak peak mass and total width of @xmath78 where the systematic errors are determined from variations in the values when different bin sizes , fitting shapes and selection criteria are used .",
    "the event yield translates into a product branching fraction ( here we denote the enhancement as @xmath79 ) : @xmath80 the statistical significance of the signal , determined from @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the likelihood values for the best - fit and for zero - signal - yield , respectively , is @xmath84 .",
    "a @xmath18 charmonium meson a mass of 3943  mev would dominantly decay to @xmath85 and/or @xmath86 ; hadronic charmonium transitions should have minuscule branching fractions . on the other hand ,",
    "decays of @xmath87-@xmath20 hybrid charmonium to @xmath88 meson pairs are forbidden or suppressed , and the relevant `` open charm '' threshold is @xmath89  mev  @xcite , where @xmath35 refers to the @xmath90 charmed mesons .",
