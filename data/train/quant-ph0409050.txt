    "electro - optic feedback is the use of a photocurrent to control the source of the light incident on the detector producing that current .",
    "such feedback has long been used to control noise in optical systems such as lasers . in many cases ,",
    "the noise which is being controlled is classical noise .",
    "that is , noise which is well above the shot - noise limit ( also known as the quantum limit ) . however , technological advance now enables experimentalists to work with light which is at , or even ( thanks to squeezing @xcite ) below , the quantum limit .",
    "thus , the quantum limits to electro - optic feedback have been of considerable interest in the past decade @xcite .",
    "our interest lies with feedback onto the dynamics of the source cavity @xcite .",
    "we have described such feedback using quantum measurement theory , in the form of stochastic quantum trajectories @xcite . in the limit that the time delay in the feedback loop is much less that the cavity lifetime , a master equation describing the feedback can be derived .",
    "this is a simple and elegant way to treat feedback .",
    "there is also a corresponding langevin equation approach @xcite , which is more convenient for some purposes .",
    "the clearest result of our theory is that , unless the system without feedback has nonclassical dynamics , then controlling its dynamics via a photocurrent can not produce nonclassical light .",
    "that is , feedback based on external photodetection can not produce squeezing .    given these limitations on the noise - reduction abilities of electro - optic feedback , it is natural to ask , what about all - optical feedback .",
    "that is , instead of detecting the emitted light , it is reflected around a loop back into the source cavity , or , more fruitfully , into another cavity which is coupled to the first cavity in some way .",
    "of course , for this mechanism to be considered feedback , the feedback loop must be one - way , otherwise we would simply be describing a pair of doubly - coupled cavities .",
    "the general configuration under consideration is shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "one mechanism for achieving the required unidirectionality is the faraday isolator which utilizes faraday rotation and polarization - sensitive beam splitters .",
    "a quantum theoretical treatment which incorporates this spatial symmetry breaking at the level of the hamiltonian has been given recently by gardiner @xcite .",
    "if the propagation time between the source system the and driven system is ignored , then a master equation for both systems may be derived .",
    "this result was obtained simultaneously by carmichael @xcite , who introduced the term  cascaded systems \" .",
    "the new feature which we consider here is for the driven system to be coupled back to the source system via some interaction hamiltonian , giving rise to all - optical feedback .",
    "the quantum theory of cascaded systems is summarized in sec .",
    "ii , and the simplest example of feedback via this method is considered . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider a more complex feedback model utilizing a nonlinear crystal to influence the source cavity , with the strength of the feedback being proportional to the intensity of the source cavity . both a master equation and a quantum langevin equation are derived , and are shown to be approximately the same as those pertaining to electro - optic feedback via direct detection .",
    "similarly , the quadrature - sensitive all - optical feedback scheme considered in sec .",
    "iv is equivalent to homodyne - mediated feedback in its effect on the source cavity .",
    "it is thus not possible to produce a nonclassical state in the source cavity via a coupling which is linear in the source cavity amplitude or intensity ( which correspond to classical driving or detuning ) . unlike the electro - optic case ,",
    "the all - optical feedback loop has an output beam of light ( reflected off the driven cavity ) , and we show that this may be squeezed even though the source cavity is not . sec .",
    "v treats an all - optical feedback scheme which is sensitive to both quadratures of the source cavity .",
    "this has no direct electro - optic equivalent , and may produce a nonclassical source state even with a coupling linear in the source amplitude",
    ". an electro - optic analogue can be defined , and the extra noise which it introduces seen explicitly .",
    "the two schemes are contrasted using the simplest feedback example introduced in sec .",
    "in this section , we present a summary of the theory of cascaded open quantum systems . for different presentations , see refs .",
    "our starting point is the input - output theory of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this theory describes a system interacting locally with a bath consisting of a continuum of harmonic oscillators .",
    "physically , the system may be an optical cavity , and the bath the external electromagnetic field modes with momentum aligned to the cavity axis . the electric field ( or rather , one polarization component ) at a particular point in space - time ( paramaterized by @xmath0 ) is represented approximately by the heisenberg picture operator @xcite @xmath1.\\ ] ] here , @xmath2 is the cross sectional area of the beam , and only frequencies near the central wave number @xmath3 are assumed to be of interest .",

    "ignoring other dynamics , the evolution of an arbitrary heisenberg operator @xmath15 is @xmath16.\\ ] ] now because of the singularity of the canonical commutation relations ( [ ccr ] ) , it is necessary to be careful in dealing with this evolution equation .",
    "a convenient method is to use quantum ito stochastic differential calculus @xcite .",

    "[ a1 ] , the bath operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 are independent of the system operator @xmath15 , which makes it an easy equation to solve .",
    "however , the price which must be paid by this simplification of ito calculus is that @xmath25 must be expanded to second order in the increment @xmath23 . now",
    "if @xmath26 is to be thought of as a bath , it should be specifiable simply by its moments .",
    "we need only the first and second order moments .",
    "the first order moment corresponds to a coherent amplitude @xmath27 while the second order moments indicate white noise : @xmath28 these equations include the cases of thermal noise ( @xmath29 ) , and perfectly squeezed white noise [ @xmath30 .",
    "it is nonclassical only if @xmath31 .",
    "note that even if @xmath32 , it is necessary to expand @xmath25 to second order because then @xmath33 , which could be regarded as vacuum noise .",

    "however , the stochastic terms can be ignored when changing from the heisenberg to the schrdinger picture and deriving the evolution of the density operator for the cavity mode alone .",

    "rather , it is a physical condition that the time delay in the feedback loop should be negligible .",
    "this is usually desirable in feedback loops .",
    "a substantial time delay may lead to instabilities and chaos , rather than control .",
    "similarly , for the feedback to be effective , the second cavity should respond much faster than the first .",

    "at the simplest level , feedback is a process by which a system influences itself through its action on a second system .",
    "usually , the second system would be a complicated feedback apparatus , consisting of measurement devices , signal processors and the like .",
    "however , it is always possible to conceive of more direct schemes , in which the feedback loop is treated on the same level as the system . in this paper",
    "we have examined feedback on optical cavities .",

    "the light emitted by the cavity enters a detector , and the photocurrent produced is used to control the dynamics of the cavity by some electro - optic devices .",

    "we have considered turning the output beam from the source cavity onto a second cavity which is directly coupled to the first by some nonlinear crystal . to compare these two methods at the quantum limit",
    ", we assumed that the feedback could be approximated as a markovian process . in the electro - optic case , this corresponds to assuming that the overall time delay in the feedback loop is much smaller than the lifetime of the source cavity , while in the all - optical case , we also need the linewidth of the second cavity to be much greater than that of the first . under these conditions ,",
    "a master equation , or quantum langevin equation can be derived for the source cavity alone .",
    "our main conclusion is that there is a strong relationship between all optical and electro - optical quantum - limited feedback .",
    "in fact , if the direct coupling hamiltonian @xmath271 between the two cavities factorizes as the product of hermitian operators in each cavity , then the all optical feedback has an exact electro - optic feedback counterpart , at least as far as the effect on the source cavity is concerned .",
    "if @xmath271 depends on the intensity of the driven cavity , then the result can be reproduced by feedback based on direct photodetection , while quadrature - dependent all - optical feedback can be reproduced by homodyne detection .",
    "the explanation for this is that the nonlinear interaction acts as an effective measurement of the driven cavity intensity or quadrature , which ( because it is heavily damped ) is a measurement of the intensity or quadrature of the output of the first cavity . unlike the electro - optic case ,",
    "the measuring device then directly influences the source cavity through the same coupling , instead of having all of the intermediate equipment . on the other hand , a purely optical feedback scheme which is sensitive to both quadratures of the driven cavity",
    "can not be replicated by currents .",
    "that is because such an interaction is not like a simultaneous measurement of both quadratures of the driven cavity .",
    "rather , the complex amplitude of the driven cavity interacts coherently with another non - hermitian quantity in the source cavity .",
    "an analogous electro - optic scheme using heterodyne detection can be defined , which has the same semiclassical effect as the complex amplitude feedback .",
    "however , the two independent measurements of the two quadratures make the feedback incoherent and introduces extra diffusion terms into the master equation .",
    "the equivalence of electro - optic and all - optical feedback for the intensity and quadrature feedback means that the latter is subject to the same restrictions as the former as far as the generation of nonclassical light is concerned .",
    "specifically , if the nonlinear interaction hamiltonian @xmath271 is linear in the _ source _ cavity amplitude or intensity , then the feedback can not produce a nonclassical state in the source cavity .",
    "the electro - optic equivalent of this theorem is that feedback based on extra - cavity detection can not produce nonclassical light by driving or detuning the cavity .",
    "however , there is a property of all - optical feedback not present in electro - optical schemes which makes the situation less clear cut : an output beam . this is the feedback loop beam reflected from the second cavity .",
    "it turns out that this beam may be arbitrarily squeezed , even though the source cavity remains classical .",
    "the way to understand this is using the measurement analogy explained above . the driven cavity is a qnd measurement device for say the @xmath187 quadrature of the output of the source cavity .",
    "this device also may control the dynamics of the source cavity such that the measured fluctuations in the @xmath187 quadrature are suppressed .",
    "thus the @xmath187 quadrature of the output of the source cavity can be squeezed ; its statistics are unchanged upon reflection at the second cavity .",
    "however , it is not until the output reflects off the second cavity ( the qnd device ) that the extra fluctuations in the @xmath202 quadrature are put in , due to the effect of the measurement .",
    "this would seem to indicate that in the loop , heisenberg s uncertainty relations fail , even though they are satisfied in the output loop ( which is all that is observable ) . however , this is not the case . the canonical commutation relations , which are actually between different spatial points of the field at the same time , are never violated .",
    "the anticorrelations in the output field which result in squeezing are only present between parts of the field which are separated in time by more than the time delay in the feedback loop .",
    "there is no contradiction .",
    "thus , it would seem that there is one potential application for all - optical feedback : producing squeezed light .",
    "however , in order to build such a device producing well - squeezed light , the coupling would have to use a frequency- ( but not polarization- ) degenerate @xmath224 crystal , as well as a polarization converter .",
    "it would seem easier to use the traditional squeezer , a @xmath224 crystal acting as a degenerate parametric oscillator .",
    "intensity - dependent all - optical feedback is even less practical , requiring a low loss @xmath177 nonlinearity to operate .",
    "the smallness of higher order nonlinearities is sufficient justification as to why we have not considered all - optical feedback with a coupling dependent on higher order field moments of the driven cavity .",
    "in fact , such higher order feedback does not produce any new results .",
    "at least in the regime where the second cavity can be adiabatically eliminated , the higher order terms either give a vanishing contribution , or reproduce the results of amplitude or intensity feedback .",
    "thus we can conclude that all - optical feedback is probably not a practical way of controlling quantum noise , although there may be other applications . nevertheless , the predicted results are interesting , and some experiments should be feasible with current technology . the similarities with and differences from electro - optic feedback yield important insights about the nature of feedback in general .",
