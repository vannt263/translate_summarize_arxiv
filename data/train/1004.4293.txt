    "mathematically , juggling is studied via siteswap sequences ( see @xcite ) which are a sequence of numbers @xmath2 which indicates a throw of a ball to `` height '' @xmath3 at time step @xmath4 ( i.e. , so the ball will land at time @xmath5 ) .",
    "a periodic juggling pattern is one which repeats in which case we only need to include enough of the sequence to get us started . a siteswap with period @xmath6 then will be a sequence @xmath7 where at time @xmath8 we throw a ball to height @xmath3 .",
    "one simple assumption to make is that no two balls _ land _ at the same time ( in multiplex juggling this condition is relaxed ) .",
    "this translates into the condition @xmath9 a simple consequence of this is that @xmath10 is integer valued and corresponds to the number of balls needed to juggle the sequence .",
    "( when @xmath11 then this indicates an empty hand or a no throw . )    another type of juggling has recently been introduced by akihiro matsuura @xcite which involves juggling inside of a sphere where balls are `` thrown '' from the north pole on great circles to return back after some number of time steps .",
    "such juggling sequences are again denoted by a siteswap @xmath7 and in addition to the condition that @xmath12 are distinct ( avoiding collisions at the north pole ) we also need that @xmath13 are distinct for the @xmath14 ( to avoid collisions at the south pole ) .",
    "we now count the number of one ball siteswap sequences of length @xmath6 for both forms of juggling , these have the added advantage of being impossible to have collisions . in this case",
    "since there is only one ball then we have that @xmath15 , i.e. , no balls can be thrown further than length @xmath6 . in particular",
    ", the only thing that we need to know is at what times we have the ball in our hands and at what time our hand is empty .",
    "this can be done by associating such juggling sequences with necklaces with two colors of beads ( with position @xmath1 at the top and increasing clockwise ) .",
    "the black beads will indicate when the ball is in our hand and the white beads will indicate when the ball is in the air .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : jug ] we have a necklace with black and white beads , to translate this into a juggling pattern we associate each white bead with a @xmath16 and each black bead with the number of steps until the next black bead ( note in one ball juggling we must throw to the next occurrence of a black bead ) .",
    "so this particular necklace is associated with the juggling sequence @xmath17 .    .",
    "]    since we must have at least one black bead and there are @xmath6 beads then in total we have @xmath18 different possible necklaces ( i.e. , everything but the all white bead necklace ) and so @xmath18 different siteswap sequences ( note that we consider rotations of necklaces distinct just as rotations of siteswap sequences are considered distinct ) .",
    "this analysis also works for spherical juggling .",
    "now let us consider the number of two ball juggling siteswap sequences with the added condition that a non - zero throw is made at each time step ( i.e. , @xmath19 for all @xmath4 ) .",
    "there is a natural correspondence between one ball juggling siteswaps and two ball juggling siteswaps with a non - zero throw made at each time step .",
    "namely if @xmath7 is a one ball juggling siteswap sequence then we associate it with @xmath20 by letting @xmath21 .",
    "clearly this does not add any collisions where two balls land at the same time and so we can conclude that the number of two ball siteswap sequences with no non - zero throws of length @xmath6 is @xmath18 .    for spherical juggling however the map @xmath22 _ might _ create collisions at the south pole . for example the sequence @xmath23 ,",
    "this latter sequence is not a spherical juggling sequence since @xmath24 .",
    "let us determine which one ball juggling sequences will produce valid two ball juggling sequences where a throw is made at every time step for spherical juggling .",
    "our only problem will be the creation of a collision at the south pole .",
    "suppose that we have the necklace associated with with the one ball siteswap sequence @xmath7 .",
    "the halfway points between two consecutive black beads marks the times where the ball is at the south pole .",
    "now when we go to @xmath20 all the occurrences of the ball at the south pole will shift clockwise by exactly a half step _ and _ every white bead will add a new ball at the south pole exactly a half step after the white bead .",
    "so collisions at the south pole will exist precisely when the halfway point between two consecutive black beads lands on top of a white bead .",
    "therefore , in terms of necklaces , we need to have at least one black bead and between any two consecutive black beads the number of white beads must be _",
    "so to find the number of two ball spherical juggling siteswap sequences of length @xmath6 with a throw made at each time we need to count the number of necklaces on @xmath6 beads where ( i ) there is at least one black bead ; ( ii ) between any two ( consecutive ) black beads there is an even number of white beads ; and ( iii ) rotations / flippings of necklaces are considered distinct . to solve this",
    "we will find a recurrence and this is done in the following more general theorem .",
    "[ mainresult ] let @xmath25 be the number of arrangements of black and white beads on a necklace with a total of @xmath6 beads satisfying the following : ( i ) there is at least one black bead ; ( ii ) between any two black beads the number of white beads is divisible by @xmath26 ; ( iii ) rotations / flippings of a necklace are considered distinct",
    ". then @xmath27 , @xmath28 and for @xmath29 @xmath30    we are interested in the case @xmath31 which produces the sequence @xmath32 these are the `` associated mersenne numbers '' ( a001350 in sloane @xcite ) , which satisfy the recurrence @xmath33 unsurprisingly these are connected to lucas numbers , @xmath34 , which satisfy a similar recurrence . in particular the lucas numbers start @xmath35 comparing the two sequences it is easy to see ( and show ) that @xmath36 in particular , our the rate of growth of the number of two ball spherical juggling siteswap sequences of length @xmath6 with a throw made at each time step is approximately @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the golden ratio . by comparison",
    "the number of two ball juggling siteswap sequences of length @xmath6 with a throw made at each time step grows at a rate of @xmath39 , significantly more .",
    "this result is one of the well known properties of lucas numbers ( see @xcite ) and this proof is essentially the same as the proof given by benjamin and quinn @xcite where they relate lucas numbers to tilings of necklaces with curved squares ( which correspond to black beads ) and curved dominoes ( which correspond to pairs of white beads ) .",
    "we observe the initial conditions are satisfied .",
    "first , @xmath27 since an admissible necklace must have at least one black bead .",
    "similarly , @xmath28 since the only admissible necklace in these cases is one with all black beads ( i.e. , there is not enough space to put @xmath26 white beads and at least one black bead in the necklace ) .",
    "there is a @xmath1-@xmath1 correspondence between necklaces on @xmath45 beads and necklaces on @xmath6 beads with white beads in positions @xmath46 .",
    "namely , given such a necklace on @xmath6 beads we remove the white beads in position @xmath46 to get an admissible necklace on @xmath45 beads , this process can also be reversed .",
    "similarly there is a @xmath1-@xmath1 correspondence between necklaces on @xmath47 beads and necklaces on @xmath6 beads with @xmath48 or more black beads and at least one black bead in one of the first @xmath26 entries .",
    "namely , given such a necklace we remove one of the black beads in position @xmath46 to get an admissible necklace on @xmath47 bead , this process can be reversed .",
    "( note it is not as clear that the reverse process results in a unique necklace . to see this we note that for the necklace on @xmath47 beads there are essentially two cases that can occur among the first @xmath49 beads : ( 1 ) if all of the beads are white then to satisfy the condition that between any two black beads the number of white beads is a multiple of @xmath26 there is a unique positions where it can be placed ; ( 2 ) if some of the beads are black then it must be placed among / adjacent to the existing black beads so that again the condition that the number of white beads is multiple of @xmath26 is satisfied . in either case the reverse process results in a unique necklace . )    finally , we count what is left",
    ". these are necklaces on @xmath6 beads with one black bead and it occurs in one of the positions @xmath46 .",
    "this is only possible if @xmath50 ( since there are exactly @xmath47 white beads between the black bead and itself ) .",
    "so there are @xmath26 remaining necklaces when @xmath50 and @xmath16 otherwise ."
