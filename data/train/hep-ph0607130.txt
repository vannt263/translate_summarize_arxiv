    "deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) at small momentum transfer @xmath1 has been the subject of a continuous progress in recent years , both on the theoretical side with the understanding of factorisation properties which allow a consistent calculation of the amplitude in the framework of qcd , and on the experimental side with the success of experiments at hera and jlab .",

    "the variable @xmath12 describes the fraction of light - cone momentum carried by the quark @xmath13 off the initial proton , @xmath14 is the corresponding one for the quark @xmath15 entering the final state proton , @xmath16 and the skewness variable @xmath17 describes the loss of plus - momentum of the incident proton ( see section 2 for more details on kinematics ) .    in the large angle regime ( around 90 degrees )",
    ", the large value of @xmath18 sets the perturbative scale . in the small angle regime as well as for the backward regime , it is the large virtuality @xmath19 of the initial photon which allows a perturbative expansion of a subprocess scattering amplitude .",

    "counting the degrees of freedom fixes the number of independent @xmath66 tdas to 16 , since each quark , photon and proton have two helicity states ( leading to @xmath67 helicity amplitudes ) and parity relates amplitudes with opposite helicities for all particles .",
    "we can equally say that the photon has spin 1 , which would normally give 24 tdas as in the @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a massive vector particle , but gauge invariance provides us with 8 relations between tdas , which reduces again the number to 16 .    the case @xmath54 is simpler since",

    "this limit on the complete set of the 16 tdas should reduce it to 4 .    in order to build leading - twist structures ( maximising the power of @xmath74 ) , we have first to separate the spinor @xmath75 in its small ( @xmath76 ) and large ( @xmath77 ) component : @xmath78 using the dirac equation @xmath79 and  eq .",

    "@xmath38 does not appear in any scalar products @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 which would also destroy one power of @xmath74 ; 5 .",
    "@xmath38 then only appears inside the parenthesis @xmath89 ; 6 .",
    "we impose the independence of the factors in @xmath89 from two different structures ; this can be checked by taking the trace of the product of two structures , and is therefore insured by choosing only independent fierz ( or dirac ) structures @xmath90 , @xmath81 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "finally , to what concerns the spinor , it has only two large components .",
    "hence , after a given @xmath89 , it appears only twice with a different dirac structure ( _ e.g. _  @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "this construction leads to define 24 possible independent structures for the transition proton to vector ( whose factors @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are dimensionless and real function of the momentum fractions @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath98 ) : @xmath99 where @xmath100 $ ] and @xmath101 is the charge - conjugation matrix .",

    "we have defined the 16 proton to photon transition distribution amplitudes entering the description of backward virtual compton scattering on proton target .",

    "i.e. _  the parton distribution functions , was used as input .",
    "model independent predictions follow from the way we propose to factorise the amplitude : only helicity amplitudes with opposite signs for both protons and photons will be nonzero at @xmath54 .",

    "@xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "observation of such a universal scaling law would provide with indications that the picture holds and dominates over a purely hadronic model as considered in  @xcite , where data are presented for low energies but for @xmath118gev@xmath119 .",
    "let us finally stress that , first , in the backward region considered here , there is almost no bethe - heitler contribution : the experimentally measured cross sections will depend bilinearly on the tdas ; secondly , the same matrix elements of eq .",

    "this universality makes the tdas an essential tool for the generalisation of the hadronic studies carried at electron machines to complementary studies to be carried in proton antiproton experiments .",
