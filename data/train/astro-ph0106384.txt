    "symbiotic novae ( sbn ) are binary systems which consist of a white dwarf ( wd ) and a late type giant , often a mira variable .",
    "colliding winds from both components after an outburst create complex hydrodynamic conditions within the system and outside .",
    "the importance of shock hydrodynamics to the evolution of symbiotic systems has been demonstrated by the morphological development at later stages ( hack & paresce 1993 , contini 1997 , contini & formiggini 1999 , etc . ) . particularly , new observational techniques detected morphological structures extending up to 2 pc , with complex phenomenology ( jets , expanding shells , `` crab legs '' , etc . ) in the circumstellar material surrounding sbn .",
    "actually , corradi et al ( 1999a ) detected an extended optical nebula in 8 d - type ( dust rich ) sbn , about 40% of the observed sample .",
    "the circumbinary gas was observed in the light of [ nii ] 6584 , which is the strongest line in most extended nebulae ( corradi et al 1999b ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on he2 - 104 which belongs to the 8 d - type sbn in the corradi et al sample . the image which appeared in an hst news release on august 1999 ( @xmath1 )",
    "is presented in fig . 1 ( see also corradi , 2000 , fig .",
    "the morphology of he2 - 104 is described by corradi & schwarz ( 1993 ) .",
    "the line spectra emitted by the inner nebula of he2 - 104 have been observed by lutz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and freitas pacheco & costa ( 1996 ) .",
    "the line ratios indicate a large range of temperatures and densities .",
    "actually , freitas pacheco & costa `` did not succeeded to reproduce the observed line ratios '' by pure photoionisation models and suggested a contribution from shocks .",
    "shocks were already invoked by schwarz , aspin , & lutz ( 1989 ) for he2 - 104 . in the present work we model the spectra by composite models which consistently account for the shock as well as for the radiation from the hot star .",
    "the suma code ( viegas & contini 1994 ) is adopted .",
    "narrow band images in [ oiii ] 5007 , h@xmath2 , [ nii ] 6584 , and [ sii ] 6731 were presented by schwarz et al ( 1989 ) , lutz et al ( 1989 ) , and corradi & schwarz ( 1993 ) .",
    "detailed spectra of the outer nebula are not yet available , the only information being that [ nii ] is the brightest line ( corradi 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the characteristics of the nebula are investigated on the basis of the qualitative information derived from the narrow band images .",
    "we note that first ionisation level lines ( e.g [ nii ] ) are generally strong in shock dominated spectra .",
    "composite models are presented in sect .",
    "he2 - 104 inner nebula spectra are modelled in sect . 3 and the outer nebula is discussed in sects . 4 and 5 . concluding remarks follow in sect .",
    "we have run a grid of composite models with the code suma ( see contini 1997 ) .",
    "the input parameters are those referring to the hot star ( the effective temperature , , the ionisation parameter , u ) and those which refer to the shock ( the shock velocity , , the preshock density , 0 , and the preshock magnetic field , 0 ) .",
    "moreover , the relative abundances to h of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , a , and fe , and the geometrical thickness , d , of the emitting filaments are also included .    both kaler ( 1976 ) and",
    "kenyon & webbink ( 1984 ) suggest that for very hot stars the blackbody approximation provides a better fit to the nebular emission lines than the stellar models .",
    "a black body approximation is adopted in suma .",
    "particularly , a grid of models with input parameters in the ranges suitable for sbn is presented by formiggini , contini , & leibowitz ( 1995 , table 3 ) .",
    "we apply to he2 - 104 the same model that was used for modelling sbn previously ( formiggini et al .",
    "1995 , contini 1997 , contini & formiggini 1999 ) , i.e. we assume that the spectrum is emitted from the interaction zone of two colliding stellar winds , one from the wd and the other from the late giant .",
    "two shock fronts form at collision ( contini & formiggini 2000 ) , one propagating in reverse towards the hot star and the other expanding outwards the system .",
    "the former is responsible for emission of lines from relatively high ionisation levels , the latter for low level and neutral lines .",
    "the emitting nebulae are , therefore , heated and photoionised both by the shock created by collisions and by the radiation flux from the hot star . in the reverse shock both the radiation and the shock act on the internal edge of the emitting nebula . in the expanding shock",
    "they act on opposite edges .",
    "we refer to the optical spectrum observed and reddening corrected by freitas pacheco & costa ( 1996 ) .",
    "the calibration of the optical spectra observed by lutz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) is uncertain and the line fluxes are not reddening corrected , so they will be used only to further constrain the model . in table 1 the strongest lines ( relative to ) and the best fitting models are presented .",
    "the parameters are chosen phenomenologically by the fit of calculated to observed line ratios .",
    "three reverse models ( models 1 , 2 , and 3 ) and one expanding model ( model 4 * ) are selected and the input parameters are listed at the bottom of table 1 . 0",
    "is 10@xmath3 gauss for all the models .",
    "@xmath4 freitas pacheco & costa ( 1996 )    we refer to the observed civ 1550/heii 1640 line ratio by lutz et al . to constrain the model .",
    "both lines are strong and the frequencies close enough to depend less dramatically on the reddening correction , even in the uv .",
    "the observed ratio , @xmath0 2 is fitted only by model 2 which yields 1.6 for it , whereas models 1 and 3 under - predict the ratios by a factor of 4 .",
    "therefore , we adopt model 2 , characterized by u=0.4 , as the best fitting model .",
    "notice that the reverse shock velocity of 300 does not represent the velocity of the expanding matter observed by schwarz et al ( 1989 ) , namely , -36 @xmath5 18 in the northern lobe , -139 @xmath5 12 in the central bright region , and -235 @xmath5 15 in the southern lobe .",
    "the calculated [ oii]/  is , however , much smaller than the observed one in model 2 , as strong lines from low ionisation levels are generally emitted by the expanding shock ( see e.g. contini 1997 and contini & formiggini 1999 ) .",
    "this is represented by model 4*. the presence of two shocks is generally revealed by the line profiles ( contini 1997 ) . since we have no information from the data , we have adopted the expanding model presented by contini & formiggini ( 1999 , table 3 , model exp3 ) for the sbn rr tel .",
    "the  absolute flux is 386 and 0.84 for models 2 and 4 * , respectively .",
    "the weighted sum of the spectra shows that the best fit is obtained by the weight ratio 1 : 10 for model 2 : model 4*. the results are given in the last column of table 1 .",
    "r@xmath6@xmath7 [ oiii ] 5007/[oiii ] 4363 is in good agreement with the observed value .",
    "r@xmath6 depends strongly on the electron density and temperature of the emitting gas .",
    "high electron densities follow from compression downstream and high temperatures follow from the relatively high shock velocity .",
    "the [ heii]/  line ratio , on the other hand , is determined particularly by .",
    "the results of table 1 indicate that the color temperature of the hot star is high enough ( = 130 000 k ) to unambiguously classify he2 - 104 as a symbiotic nova .",
    "the relative abundances adopted in these calculations are he / h=0.1 , n / h=1.5@xmath8 , and o / h=4.6@xmath910@xmath10 ( formiggini et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the [ fevi ] 5176/  line ratio is under - predicted by model 2 but overpredicted by model 3 , while [ fevii]/  is rather well fitted .",
    "therefore , a model between models 2 and 3 would better fit the [ fevi]/  line ratio . in this case",
    "the fit of all the line ratios would improve , except for civ 1550/heii 1640 .",
    "the [ sii ] 6716/6730 line ratio is under - predicted by model 2 , indicating higher electron densities in the emitting gas .",
    "freitas pacheco & costa find a density stratification from different line ratios , the density value deduced from the [ sii ] 6716/6730 ratio being the lower limit .",
    "a stratification of densities and ( temperatures ) downstream is characteristic of models which account for the shock .",
    "moreover , the error of the observed lines is not quoted by freitas pacheco & costa .",
    "a line intensity error of @xmath0 20 % would improve the fit of the predicted ratio .",
    "in spite of the lack of quantitative data about the spectrum , some general considerations can be derived .",
    "the emitting filaments ( or the `` crab legs '' , see sect .",
    "5 ) propagate outwards and a shock front develops on the outer edge .",
    "radiation from the hot star reaches the inner edge of the filaments .",
    "the temperature of the hot star ( @xmath0 130 000 k ) results from detailed modelling of the inner nebula ( sect .",
    "an effective temperature of = 130 000 k , implies an ionising photon flux of @xmath11=3.3 10@xmath12 photons @xmath13 .",
    "this flux is related to the ionisation parameter , u , and to the gas ( number ) density downstream , n , in the radiation dominated region of the filaments , by : @xmath11 @xmath14 = u n c , where @xmath15 cm is the radius of the wd , and r @xmath0 0.3 pc ( corradi 2000 ) is the distance of the filament region from the hot source .",
    "we obtain :    u = 0.01(/1.3 10@xmath16k)@xmath17(@xmath18/10@xmath19cm)@xmath20(r/10@xmath21cm)@xmath22/n    the downstream compression ( n/0 ) increases with higher  and decreases with higher 0 . even adopting for 0",
    "the ism density value ( 0@xmath231 3 ) the resulting n would lead to a very low u. this is reasonable in view of the large distance of the filaments from the hot source .",
    "the gas inside the filaments will be mainly ionised and heated by the shock .",
    "consequently , shock dominated ( u=0 ) models will be adopted in the calculation of line intensities .",
    "the models selected from the grid , which show the observed spectrum characteristics ( prominent [ nii ] 6584 line absolute and relative to [ oiii ] 5007 ) are presented in table 2 .",
    "the input parameters appear in columns 2 - 5 , and in columns 6 - 9 the absolute fluxes of the [ oiii ] 5007 , [ oii ] 3727 , [ nii ] 6584 , and  lines are presented .",
    "the observed expansion velocities of the outer nebula are about 50 - 100 ( corradi & schwarz 1993 ) and @xmath0 250 in the blobs related to the jets ( corradi & schwarz 1995 ) .",
    "so , we present in table 2 the results of calculations for  between 50 and 250 .    in fig .",
    "2 the physical conditions of the emitting gas relative to models o1 and o6 ( table 2 ) , which show extreme , are presented .",
    "the electron densities downstream in both diagrams ( fig .",
    "2 ) are in agreement with the densities of 300 - 1000 3 found in the `` crab legs '' by corradi & schwarz ( 1993 ) .",
    "interestingly , for model o1 ( fig .",
    "2 left ) n@xmath24 is lower than o@xmath24 , while f@xmath25}$ ] is higher than f@xmath26}$ ] . in fact , both the ionisation potential , @xmath27 , and the collision strength , @xmath28 , are important in the calculation of collisional excited lines : f@xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath28 exp(-@xmath27 ) y@xmath31/y ( osterbrock ( 1989 ) .",
    "actually , @xmath27 is 1.90 ev and 3.32 ev for the transitions @xmath17p - @xmath4d ( nii ) and @xmath32s - @xmath20d ( oii ) , respectively , and @xmath28 is 2.99 and 1.47 , respectively , leading to the intensities shown in table 2 .",
    "the relative high  ( 250 ) in model o6 creates a large zone of high temperature gas ( @xmath33 k ) , which corresponds to soft x - ray emission from the postshock region of the blobs .",
    "however , this model refers to the jets , which angle is very small ( see fig .",
    "the calculated x - ray flux is 0.036 at the nebula and @xmath3410@xmath35 at earth , if the jet projected opening angle is @xmath36 5@xmath37 .",
    "since the angle is @xmath34 5@xmath37 , he2 - 104 flux is below the rosat all - sky- survey detection limit ( @xmath0 10@xmath35 ) .",
    "the outer nebula filaments , named `` crab - legs '' , are clearly identified in fig .",
    "1 . the r - t instability created by turbulence at the shock front leads to fragmentation of matter .",
    "the strong resemblence between the `` crab legs '' which appear in the he2 - 104 image ( fig . 1 ) and the boundary of the shock front presented by graham & zhang ( 2000 ) and , particularly , by gull ( 1975 , fig .",
    "3 ii ) suggests that the `` legs '' are actually formed by r - t instability .",
    "a rough evaluation of the filling factor can be derived from some general considerations . adopting for he2 - 104 the typical mira mass loss rate , @xmath38 = 10@xmath39 yr@xmath40 , and an age t = 900 yr ( corradi 2000 ) ,",
    "the ejected mass in he2 - 104 is m @xmath0 10@xmath3 , the radius of the he2 - 104 outer nebula is about 0.3 pc ( corradi 2000 ) .",
    "the swept up mass to ejected mass ratio is about 7 , if the number density in the ism is 2 3 .",
    "assuming that all the ejected+swept up matter resides in the `` crab legs '' , the filling factor , f , in the outer nebula can be calculated by m(1 + 7)=4 @xmath41 r@xmath20 dd m@xmath42 n@xmath43 f , where dd is the geometrical thickness of the region containing most of the `` legs '' .",
    "we roughly derive from the image in fig .",
    "1 that dd is of the order of @xmath0 3.5 10@xmath44 cm . adopting m=2 @xmath45 g , r= 10@xmath21 cm , and a density in the `` legs '' n@xmath43=1000 3 , the filling factor f results @xmath0 0.002 , in agreement with the clumpy structure of the outer nebula .",
    "in this paper we have modelled the spectra emitted from both the inner and the outer nebulae around he2 - 104 .",
    "the results of model calculations show the important role of the shocks . it is found that in the inner nebula the preshock density is 0= 7 10@xmath32 3 . in the outer nebula",
    "0= 10@xmath17 - 10@xmath32 3 . the high gap between the density in the outer nebula `` crab legs '' and that in the ism , shows that the characteristics of the original ejected matter , even if partly washed out by merging with the ism , are still recognizable .",
    "the ionisation parameter is u=0.4 in the inner nebula and negligible in the outer one , indicating that the effect of shocks dominates far away from the symbiotic system .",
    "shock velocities of 50 - 250 provide the prevailing [ nii ] line in the outer nebula .",
    "soft x - ray emission is predicted from the jet blobs which show the highest shock velocity .",
    "the magnetic field is 0=10@xmath3 gauss in the inner nebula and 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath46 gauss in the outer nebula . finally , the temperature of the hot star which results from modelling is @xmath0 130 000 k.          contini , m. 1997 apj , 483 , 887 contini , m. & formiggini , l. 1999 apj , 517 , 925 contini , m. & formiggini , l. 2000 in `` thermal and ionization aspects of the flows from hot stars : observations and theory '' .",
