    "in a recent calculation  @xcite , two - dimensional @xmath0 theory was solved for the lowest mass eigenstates of the light - front hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenstates were represented by truncated fock - state expansions , with momentum - space wave functions as the coefficients .",
    "this work included estimation of the critical coupling , where the @xmath1 symmetry of the theory is broken  @xcite . at this critical coupling , one would expect that the probabilities for the higher fock sectors , computed as integrals of the squares of the fock wave functions , would increase dramatically .",
    "in particular , the probability for the one - particle sector of the lowest massive state should go to zero .",
    "this was not observed .",
    "the expectation that the one - particle probability would go to zero is important for the calculation of the connection between equal - time  @xcite and light - front estimates  @xcite of the critical coupling .",
    "this is determined by the relationship between the different mass renormalizations in the two quantizations  @xcite , which is fixed by tadpole contributions computed from the vacuum expectation value of @xmath2 .",
    "the behavior of this vacuum expectation value is dominated by the product of the one - particle probability times the logarithm of the mass  @xcite .",
    "the mass goes to zero at the critical coupling , making zero probability a necessity for a finite result .    in the previous work ,",
    "the explanation proposed for this apparent paradox was that the calculation did not use sector - dependent bare masses .",
    "this meant that the highest fock sector kept in the calculation used a fixed bare mass even as the eigenstate mass approached zero .",
    "excitation of such fock states is then very unlikely .",
    "the use of sector - dependent bare parameters , or ` sector - dependent renormalization ' as it is usually called , has a long history  @xcite . a fock - space truncation forces self - energy corrections and vertex corrections to be different in different fock sectors .",
    "this makes sector - dependent counterterms a natural choice .",
    "in addition , the truncation causes divergences that would have been canceled by contributions from higher fock states that are now absent .",
    "sector - dependent counterterms can take these divergences into account .",
    "however , in at least some theories , the sector - dependent bare couplings can lead to inconsistencies in the interpretation of wave functions and fock - sector probabilities  @xcite .",
    "thus , use of sector - dependent bare masses can be a compromise .",
    "of course , for two - dimensional @xmath0 theory , divergences are not the issue , and it is only near the critical coupling where sector - dependent masses could be a useful approximation , as already indicated by some preliminary work  @xcite .    the use of light - front quantization  @xcite is important for its simple vacuum and well - defined fock state expansions as well as for the separation of relative and external momenta .",
    "we define light - front coordinates  @xcite as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the light - front time .",
    "the light - front energy is then @xmath5 , and the light - front momentum is @xmath6 . in what follows",
    ", we will drop the superscript from @xmath7 to simplify the notation .",
    "the inner product between momentum and position is @xmath8 , and the mass - shell condition is @xmath9 .",
    "the light - front hamiltonian eigenvalue problem is then @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the eigenstate with mass @xmath12 and light - front momentum @xmath13 .",
    "the eigenstate is expanded in a set of fock states , which converts the formal eigenvalue problem into a system of equations for the fock - state wave functions .",
    "numerical approximations then transform this system into a matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "our chosen numerical approximation is an expansion of the wave functions in terms of symmetric multivariate polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the content of the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : phi4theory ] provides a brief introduction to @xmath0 theory and formulates the system of equations for the fock - state wave functions .",
    "these equations are modified in sec .",

    "the probability of the @xmath22th fock sector is then just @xmath27 . because the hamiltonian changes particle number by zero or two , never an odd number , the sum over fock sectors is either even or odd , depending on which state is chosen as the lowest fock state .",

    "this is an infinite system and requires some form of truncation before a numerical solution can be attempted .",
    "the standard truncation is a fock - space truncation to some maximum number of constituents @xmath28 .",
    "however , as discussed in the introduction , this causes self - energy contributions to become sector - dependent . for the sector with @xmath29",

    "to implement a sector - dependent bare mass , we replace @xmath14 in the first term of ( [ eq : coupledsystem ] ) by @xmath30 and compute the @xmath30 for a given eigenmass @xmath12 by steadily increasing @xmath28 . for @xmath31 , we have immediately that @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for @xmath34 , we set @xmath35 and solve the following two equations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 : _ 1 ^ 2_1 + ( 1-x_1-x_2-x_3)_3(x_1,x_2,x_3)=m^2 _ 1 _ i^3 _ 3(y_1,y_2,y_3 ) & + & ( y_1+y_2-x_1-x_2 ) _",

    "we continue in this manner until @xmath36 has converged with respect to the fock - space truncation fixed by @xmath28 .",
    "as described in the appendix , the equations are solved numerically , with the wave functions expanded in a polynomial basis  @xcite .",
    "the principal result of the calculation is the plot of the eigenvalues versus coupling strength in fig .",

    "these are computed as @xmath46 , for both the sector - dependent and standard parameterizations . in the former case , @xmath45 and in the latter , @xmath47 . for the sector - dependent calculations , results do not extend beyond the critical coupling ,",
    "because negative @xmath44 is ill - defined for sector - dependent renormalization ; the bare mass in the highest fock sector would then be imaginary .",
    "the relative probabilities are essentially the same in the three - body fock sector , indicating full convergence with respect to the fock - space truncation . in fock sectors with five and seven constituents , the relative probability for the sector - dependent case rises above the probability in the standard case as the critical coupling is approached .",
    "the greater probability is expected ; however , the full expectation was that these probabilities would have a much more striking increase .",
    "in fact , as relative probabilities , they will tend to infinity as the one - body probability @xmath48 goes to zero , and obviously this is not happening , and the original hypothesis , that sector - dependent bare masses would resolve the paradox , must be incorrect .",
    "relative fock - sector probabilities for the three , five , seven and nine - constituent sectors when the truncation is @xmath45 .",
    ", width=566 ]    the finite one - body probability also prevents any improvement in the calculation of the difference in mass renormalization between equal - time and light - front quantization , as attempted in @xcite .",
    "therefore , no new calculation is attempted here .",
    "contrary to expectations , we have found that a sector - dependent bare mass does not provide any significant improvement in the solution of @xmath49 theory .",
    "the sector dependence does allow higher fock states to have a larger contribution , but the contribution to the lowest massive state is not large in an absolute sense , and the one - body contribution remains dominant , even at the critical coupling .",
    "convergence of the bare mass in the lowest sectors , as the fock - space truncation is relaxed , is quite rapid , as can be seen in fig .",

    "the relationship between fock wave functions is truncated , so that wave functions of the higher fock states are related to those of the lower states in a simple way .",
    "the wave functions are then determined by a nonlinear equation that sums over contributions from all fock states . in this calculation",

    "the hint is that coherent effects across all of fock space are important , something that ordinary fock - space truncation would not be able to reproduce .",
