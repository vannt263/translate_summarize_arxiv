    "interference phenomena of material particles ( say , electrons , neutrons , etc ) provide us with the most convincing evidence for the need to elaborate a new mechanics which goes beyond and encompasses classical mechanics . at the same time , ` corpuscular ' behaviour of radiation , light , as exhibited in phenomena like photoelectric and compton effects shows that also the description of radiation has to undergo deep changes .",
    "the relation between the corpuscular - like and the wave - like behaviour is fully captured by the following equation that we may call the * einstein  de broglie * relation @xmath0    this relation between the poincar 1-form on the phase - space over space - time and the optical 1-form on the optical phase - space establishes a relation between momentum and energy of the ` corpuscular ' behaviour and the frequency of the ` wave ' behaviour .",
    "the proportionality coefficient is the planck constant .",
    "the way we use this relation is to predict under which experimental conditions light of a given wave length and frequency would be detected as a corpuscle with a corresponding momentum and energy and vice - versa ( i.e. when an electron would be detected as a wave in the appropriate experimental conditions ) .    if we examine more closely an interference experiment , like the double slit one , we find some peculiar aspects for which we do not have a simple interpretation in the classical setting .    if we perform the experiment in such a way that we make sure that , at each time , only one electron is present between the source and the screen , we find that the electron impinges on the screen at ` given points ' .",
    "after few hundred electrons have passed , we find a picture of random spots distributed on the screen .",
    "however , with several thousands electrons , we get a very clear typical interference figure .",
    "the same situation happens again if we experiment with photons ( light quanta ) , with an experimental arrangement that makes sure that only one photon is present at each time .",
    "this experiment suggests that the new theory must have a wave character ( to take into account the interference aspects ) , statistical - probabilistic character along with an intrinsically discrete aspect .",
    "all this is quite counter - intuitive for particles , but it is even more startling for light . within the classical",
    "setting we have to accept that it is not so simple to provide a single model capable of capturing these various aspects at the same time .    from the historical point of view , things developed differently because inconsistencies arose already in the derivation of the law for the spectral distribution of energy density of a black - body .",
    "moreover , it was not possible to account for the stability of atoms and molecules along with the detected atomic spectra .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an account of the experimental foundations of quantum theory and for other background material .",
    "the efforts of theoreticians gave rise to two alternative , but equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics .",
    "they are usually called the schrdinger picture and the heisenberg picture . as we are going to see in the coming sections , the first one uses as a primary object the carrier space of states , while the latter uses as carrier space the space of observables .",
    "schrdinger equation has the form @xmath1    the complex valued function @xmath2 is called the * wave function * , it is defined on the configuration space of the system we are considering , and it is interpreted as a probabilistic amplitude .",
    "this interpretation requires that @xmath3 i.e. because of the probabilistic interpretation @xmath4 must be a probability density and therefore @xmath2 must be required to be square - integrable .",
    "thus wave functions must be elements of a hilbert space of square integrable functions .",
    "the operator @xmath5 , acting on wave functions , is the infinitesimal generator of a one - parameter group of unitary transformations describing the evolution of the system under consideration .",
    "these are the basic ingredients appearing in the schrdinger evolution equation .",
    "the presence of the new fundamental constant @xmath6 within the new class of phenomena implies some fundamental aspects completely new from the previous classical ones .",
    "it is clear that any measurement process requires an exchange of energy ( or information ) between the object we are measuring and the measuring apparatus .",
    "the existence of @xmath6 requires that these exchanges can not be made arbitrarily small and therefore idealized to be negligible .",
    "thus the presence of @xmath6 in the quantum theory means that in the measurement process we can not conceive of a sharp separation between the ` object ' and the ` apparatus ' so that we may forget of the apparatus altogether .",
    "we should remark that even if the apparatus may be described classically , it is to be considered as a quantum system with a quantum interaction with the object to be measured .",
    "moreover , in the measuring process , there is an inherent ambiguity in the ` cut ' between what we identify as the object and what we identify as apparatus @xcite .",
    "the problem of measurement in quantum theory is a very deep one and goes beyond the scope of these notes .",
    "we may simply mention that within the von neumann formulation of quantum mechanics ( see @xcite ) the measurement problem gives rise to the so called ` wave - function collapse ' .",
    "the state vector of the system we are considering , when we measure some real dynamical variable @xmath7 , is projected onto one of the eigenspaces of @xmath7 with some probability that can be computed . as the scope of these notes is only to highlight the various mathematical structures present in the different formulations of quantum mechanics we shall adhere to the von neumann projection prescription .    to avoid technicalities we shall mainly work within a finite dimensional framework , i.e. with finite dimensional hilbert spaces . in this setting",
    "we are going to deal with the schrdinger and heisenberg pictures and we shall also provide a geometrical unifying version of the two pictures . however , to be able to consider the quantum - classical transition in a meaningful way , we shall consider the weyl  wigner formalism in infinite dimensional hilbert spaces .    before closing this introduction and to better put into perspective the schrdinger and the heisenberg pictures we are going to make a few general considerations on the minimal mathematical structure required for the description of a physical system .    from a general point of view , we need three ingredients :    * a space of states , that we denote as @xmath8 , * a space of observables , that we denote as @xmath9 and * a real valued pairing @xmath10 .",
    "this pairing , which produces a real number out of an observable and a state , represents the measuring operation .    in quantum mechanics , we have two main pictures .    * in the schrdinger picture",
    ", @xmath8 is associated with a hilbert space @xmath11 and the set of dynamical variables ( the observables ) is a derived concept .",
    "observables are identified with self - adjoint bounded operators on @xmath11 . * in the heisenberg picture the situation is complementary : the set of dynamical variables ( the observables ) is the primary concept .",
    "they are assumed to be ( the real part ) of a @xmath12-algebra @xmath13 .",
    "the states , on the other hand , are a derived concept defined as a proper subset of the set of linear functionals on @xmath13",
    ".    it should be stressed , however , that a physical system requires , in addition to either one of the two primary carrier spaces , a concrete realization of it to allow us to identify the physical variables .",
    "this last requirement is often overlooked in the literature .",
    "we can clarify this last point with a specific example taken from classical mechanics but that applies equally well within quantum mechanics .",
    "let us consider the carrier space for a classical system to be a phase space @xmath14 equipped with a poisson bracket .",
    "considering coordinates @xmath15 we define the poisson structure in the form @xmath16    this carrier space is appropriate to describe an electron - monopole system or a massless particle with helicity .",
    "indeed if we set @xmath17 the resulting poisson brackets take the form required in the electron - monopole system .",
    "the brackets of the momenta are thus proportional to the magnetic field of the monopole .",
    "if we set @xmath18 and @xmath19 , on the other hand , we endow the carrier space with the poisson structure required to model the dynamical behaviour of a massless spinning particle .",
    "the cubic term in the denominator of the bracket of two position coordinates accounts then for the fact that a zero - rest - mass particle can not be reduced to rest .",
    "and the non - vanishing of these brackets is taking into account that massless particles can not be localized in space .",
    "a very similar situation prevails in the corresponding quantum situation . for a more detailed description of these problems ,",
    "the interested reader is addressed to @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the description of a physical system requires not only an abstract mathematical model ( a poisson manifold , a hilbert space , a @xmath12-algebra ,  ) but also a specific realization with an identification of the physical variables .",
    "for further reading see @xcite .",
    "our goal in this section is to present the very basic ingredients of quantum mechanics , just to establish the departure point of the analysis we will carry on in the following sections .",
    "we will just mention the two most familiar formulations of quantum mechanics , our aim being to identify the relevant mathematical structures required for their definition .",
    "once we know them , they will be studied in much more detail and from the point of view of geometry in the following sections . for more details",
    "see @xcite .      in this formalism",
    "the carrier space is the hilbert space of states of the system @xmath11 , very often the space of complex square integrable functions defined on some spatial domain @xmath20 , identified with the configuration space .",
    "this is the set of pure states @xmath21 of our system represented by the wave - functions we mentioned in the introduction .",
    "observables are then defined as self - adjoint operators acting on this hilbert space .",
    "thus , the set of operators @xmath9 depends , for its definition , on the definition of the set of states .",
    "the pairing is defined in terms of the hermitian structure of the hilbert space associating a real value to the pair @xmath22 as @xmath23    dynamics is defined on this space by means of the schrdinger equation @xmath24 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian operator of the system and is assumed to be hermitian . in more technical terms , we can consider thus a vector field corresponding to the equations of motion @xmath25 which becomes the infinitesimal generator of a one - parameter group of unitary transformations . as we would like to concentrate our attention on the geometrical aspects , in this paper we will assume , for the sake of simplicity , that the hilbert space is finite dimensional .    in the particular case of a one - level system",
    ", we can introduce two real variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 to represent @xmath2 ( its real and imaginary parts respectively @xmath28 ) and the schrdinger equation takes the form ( see @xcite ) : @xmath29 we conclude thus that the description of the dynamics in terms of real coordinates is represented by a hamiltonian vector field .",
    "actually this is a general property , also valid for infinite dimensional systems : schrdinger equations of motion will be a particular hamiltonian dynamics on some infinite dimensional symplectic vector space .",
    "we can elaborate a little further on this statement .",
    "if @xmath11 denotes a complex hilbert space we can decompose the hermitian product @xmath30 into real and imaginary parts as follows : @xmath31 where the real and imaginary parts represent an euclidean and a symplectic product respectively . on the associated realification of @xmath11 ( say @xmath32 ) we have a complex structure @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 .",
    "thus the carrier space is endowed with a khler structure .",
    "vector fields associated with the schrdinger equation are not only symplectic , they are also killing vector fields or , more specifically , they are khlerian vector fields , i.e. they preserve the khler structure .      in this picture",
    "observables are associated with hermitian operators .",
    "they encode the measurable information of the system and the dynamics must now be defined as a flow on this space .",
    "states are thus defined as normalized positive functionals on hermitian operators .",
    "hermitian operators do not carry an associative algebra structure ( i.e. the product of two hermitian operators will not be , in general , hermitian ) .",
    "however , it is possible to endow the set with one scalar product and two binary products :    * the scalar product is the restriction to the set @xmath9 of hermitian operators of the scalar product of two complex matrices defined as @xmath35 in the case of hermitian matrices this becomes @xmath36 * the first binary operation is the abelian real jordan algebra product @xmath37_+=\\frac 12 ( ab+ba)=\\frac 14 \\left ( ( a+b)^2-(a - b)^2 \\right ) \\,.\\ ] ] let us recall , for completeness , the definition of jordan algebra : + a ( non - associative ) algebra @xmath38 is called a * jordan algebra * if the composition law is commutative and for any two arbitrary elements @xmath39 , @xmath40 . + with this definition we can conclude + @xmath41 is a jordan algebra . +",
    "the map @xmath42 is called the * associator * of the algebra , and the algebra is associative if and only if the associator is identically zero . *",
    "the second binary structure is a lie algebra structure @xmath43_-=\\frac 1{i\\hbar}(ab - ba),\\ ] ] which comes from the fact that for any hermitian operator @xmath7 , @xmath44 is an infinitesimal generator of the unitary group .",
    "+ therefore , multiplying each element in the set by the imaginary unit we get the lie algebra of the unitary group .",
    "the scalar product is also invariant with respect to this new product , and we have : @xmath45_{- } , c\\rangle = \\langle a , [ b , c]_{-}\\rangle \\ , , \\qquad   \\langle [ a , b]_{+ } , c\\rangle = \\langle a , [ b , c]_{+}\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ]    moreover we also have the compatibility relation @xmath46_{-}=[a , b]_{-}\\circ c+b\\circ [ a , c]_{-}\\,\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath47 is a derivation of the jordan algebra for any @xmath48 .",
    "actually these two structures can be combined together in the notion of lie ",
    "jordan algebra ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "now we can proceed to define dynamics on this algebra .",
    "it is introduced by means of the * heisenberg equation * , which makes use of the skew - symmetric structure of the algebra : @xmath49_-",
    "\\quad a\\in \\mathcal{a}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the equations of motion written in this form are necessarily derivations of the two products ( i.e. a derivation of the lie ",
    "jordan product ) and can be considered hence ` intrinsically hamiltonian ' . in the schrdinger picture ,",
    "if the vector field is not anti - hermitian , the equation still makes sense , but the dynamics is not khlerian .",
    "our purpose in this section is to present quantum mechanics from a geometric perspective . we choose to do it in the case of finite dimensional hilbert spaces ( i.e. systems with a finite number of energy levels , for instance ) because of their simplicity , although all the objects that we are going to introduce make sense in general for infinite dimensional hilbert spaces as well .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "thinking in terms of the schrdinger picture , we know that the set of pure states @xmath21 is associated with a hilbert space .",
    "let us study in detail the geometrical objects which play a role in the definition of the dynamics within the schrdinger picture .",
    "we want to consider the space @xmath21 as a differentiable manifold instead of a linear space .",
    "we can consider the complex vector space as a real vector space ( i.e. a ` realification ' ) if we consider the natural complex structure @xmath50 ( @xmath51 of the hilbert space . but to consider a differentiable structure implies that we have to associate tensorial objects with the vectors and linear maps which we have studied so far .",
    "* the first task is the association of vectors of @xmath11 with vector fields on the manifold .",
    "being a linear space , @xmath11 can be identified with the tangent space at any point , and hence we can write @xmath52 . thus it makes sense to consider , for an element @xmath53 the vector field @xmath54 defined as a section of @xmath55 : @xmath56 + this vector field acts on a function @xmath57 as : @xmath58 besides , these constant sections define a separating set in the hilbert space .",
    "* let us consider the khler structure on the hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the scalar product of two vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and consider the structure of real manifold .",
    "the scalar product above is written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is now a symmetric tensor and @xmath64 a skew - symmetric one .",
    "the properties of the hermitian product ensure that : * * the symmetric tensor is positive definite and non - degenerate , and hence defines a riemannian structure on the real vector space . * * the skew - symmetric tensor is also non degenerate , and is closed with respect to the natural differential structure of the vector space .",
    "hence , the tensor is a symplectic form .",
    "+ as the inner product is sesquilinear , it satisfies @xmath65 this implies @xmath66 or , equivalently , that the triple @xmath67 defines a khler structure .",
    "+ these two tensors @xmath63 and @xmath68 are in a covariant form",
    ". we can also define their contravariant forms by considering the dual vector space @xmath69 identified wth @xmath32 , for instance via the metric @xmath63 ( which is non - degenerate ) .",
    "the association of vectors of @xmath11 with vector fields can be extended to associate also 1-forms with the elements of @xmath69 .",
    "we will have then an assignment @xmath70 , i.e. we write @xmath71 . in this way we define the contravariant tensors @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which allow us to define a scalar product on @xmath69 as : @xmath74 + if we select an orthonormal basis @xmath75 for @xmath76 , we may define coordinates by setting @xmath77 , and we have used dirac s notation for bras and kets . + in these coordinates we have a contra - variant version of the euclidean structure given by @xmath78 and the poisson tensor @xmath79 while the complex structure has the form @xmath80 . + in terms of complex",
    "coordinates the hermitian structure has the form @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding contra - variant form is given by @xmath82 + we may now define binary products on functions by setting @xmath83      in addition , we can consider the linear structure of the hilbert space and associate with it the liouville vector field : @xmath84 which , as usual , allows us to define homogeneous polynomial functions : a function @xmath85 is homogeneous of degree @xmath86 if @xmath87",
    ". combining this tensor with the complex structure , it is possible to define a new vector field @xmath88    @xmath89 and @xmath90 commute and therefore generate an integrable distribution which defines a foliation on the hilbert space .",
    "these two tensors also help us to define a way of associating a tensor to any operator acting on @xmath11 .",
    "there are several ways to do it , some are more immediate than others :    * we can associate a quadratic function @xmath91 to any constant symmetric 2-tensor field @xmath92 in the form : @xmath93 and similarly for higher order tensors .",
    "* skew - symmetric 2-tensors @xmath94 are transformed into functions in a similar way , using also the complex structure : @xmath95 when we consider as skew - symmetric tensor the symplectic form @xmath64 , the resulting function is the hamiltonian function generating the one - parameter group of unitary transformations which defines the multiplication by a phase . *",
    "any linear operator @xmath96 can be identified with : * * a ( 1:1 ) tensor field @xmath97 * * or two different vector fields @xmath98 and @xmath99 if @xmath7 is hermitian , then @xmath100 corresponds to a gradient vector field with respect to the khler structure , while @xmath101 corresponds to the hamiltonian vector field associated to the evaluation function of the operator ( i.e. @xmath102 ) .",
    "these associations have different properties : * * * the mapping @xmath103 is an isomorphism of associative algebras ( and as a result also with respect to the lie algebra structure ) .",
    "as we are interested in the ` realification ' of operators acting on the complex vector space , we shall restrict our considerations to tensors satisfying @xmath104 . * * * the mappings @xmath105 or @xmath106 on the other hand are only isomorphisms of lie structures , and the properties of the associative product of operators is lost .",
    "* occasionally , to make easier the comparison with the usual formalism , we consider the space @xmath21 as a real manifold but , at each point @xmath2 , we may consider @xmath107 as a complex vector space . in this case",
    ", vector fields would have a real and an imaginary part .",
    "however , even when this notation might be misleading , we shall always be considering the derivations on @xmath21 in the real sense .",
    "hence , we shall not be considering derivations with respect to complex variables and , as a result , we do not need to consider complex analiticity for our functions .",
    "we will have , though , complex valued functions arising as the contraction of complex valued vector field with complex values one forms .",
    "+ by using the ` mixed ' point of view , it is also possible to associate a complex valued quadratic function on @xmath11 to any linear transformation @xmath108 by defining @xmath109 + given the quadratic function @xmath110 , associated to the operator @xmath111 , the 1-form @xmath112 acts on a vector field @xmath54 as @xmath113 + the hamiltonian vector field corresponding to @xmath114 by @xmath68 : @xmath115 where we used the relation between the riemannian and the symplectic khler forms and the definition of the vector fields .",
    "+ in conclusion tensor fields on the real manifold @xmath21 will be considered as modules over complex - valued functions on @xmath21 .",
    "please notice that the above definitions are intrinsic and can be applied whenever the tensors used are available . as a result ,",
    "it is also possible to define these objects at the level of infinite dimensional hilbert spaces .      our geometrization procedure has allowed to replace operators with complex valued functions @xmath116 .",
    "this association is clearly injective , but it is not onto , i.e. there are functions on @xmath11 which are not quadratic .",
    "the association is obviously linear but the image is not closed under the pointwise product ( the product of two quadratic functions is not quadratic but quartic ) .",
    "therefore the product can not be the image of an operator .",
    "thus the pointwise product does not allow to transfer the associative product of operators to the set of quadratic functions .",
    "however , we might consider a non - local product , inner in the space of quadratic functions , and defined as @xmath117    this product is not commutative and non - local .",
    "it requires , however , that we start with operators , or their tensorial versions as @xmath118 tensor fields .",
    "it seems advisable to describe this product only in terms of the tensors already available on the real differentiable manifold @xmath21 .",
    "we notice first that if @xmath7 and @xmath119 are hermitian , with associated real valued quadratic functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the product @xmath122 need not be a real valued function ( for the product of two hermitian operators is not hermitian , in general ) . using the fact that these functions are quadratic",
    ", we may consider the quantity @xmath123 , where @xmath72 is the contravariant form of the metric tensor .",
    "this combination is clearly a quadratic function , because we know that @xmath72 satisfies @xmath124 . by straightforward computations",
    ", we can obtain that @xmath125    in a similar way , by using the skew - symmetric tensor @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath126}=f_{[a , b]_-}\\,.\\ ] ]    thus the lie ",
    "jordan algebra structure on the space of real quadratic functions can be extracted from the hermitian tensor . for later use ( when we consider the complex projective space )",
    "it is convenient to characterize these functions defining the lie ",
    "jordan structure without using the notion of quadratic function ( for it does not make sense on nonlinear spaces ) .",
    "it is possible to show that :    given a function @xmath57 , the hamiltonian vector field @xmath127 preserves the metric tensor @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath128 if and only if @xmath57 is a quadratic function associated with some hermitian operator .",
    "thus , a subset of functions in @xmath129 can be selected and defines a lie ",
    "jordan algebra with the tensors @xmath72 and @xmath73 if and only if they are real quadratic .",
    "moreover , if we consider this subset of functions we get @xmath130 by linearity , we can extend these operations to complex valued functions .",
    "then , this operation defines a @xmath12-algebra structure on the space of complex valued functions whose real and imaginary parts are associated with hermitian operators .",
    "the norm of this @xmath12algebra is given by the usual @xmath131 norm , i.e. the supremum of the values that the operator takes on normalized states .    in this way",
    ", our geometrization procedure has reproduced the algebra of observables in terms of real valued functions on @xmath21 .",
    "as we have already remarked , the evolution of a quantum system defines a one - parameter group of transformation of @xmath21 which preserve the khler structure .",
    "all transformations preserving the khler structure form the set of unitary transformations of @xmath11 , and in the case of finite dimensional hilbert spaces ( @xmath132 ) , they provide a realization of the unitary group @xmath133 .    in order to represent these operators in our setting , we can consider the set of hermitian operators and use the vector field association .",
    "the one parameter group of unitary transformations associated with the hermitian operator @xmath7 is @xmath134      the probabilistic interpretation of states assigns a physical meaning only to ` normalized wave - functions by means of the probability densities @xmath135 ' .",
    "thus the meaningful physical space is the complex projective space associated to the hilbert space @xmath11 .",
    "then , the next step is to induce the geometrical structures we have considered above onto the complex projective space .",
    "the usual way to define the complex projective space is by means of equivalence classes .",
    "the complex vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 are considered to be equivalent if there exists a nonzero complex number @xmath136 such that @xmath137 .",
    "we can denote the equivalence class by one of its representatives , say @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "if we write @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) we see immediately that equivalence classes are orbits of the group @xmath141 .",
    "thus , removing the zero vector , the complex projective space is the set of orbits of that group acting on @xmath142 .",
    "the infinitesimal generators of the action can be easily determined : @xmath90 is the generator of the modulus part ( dilations ) while @xmath143 is the generator of the phase change .",
    "if we consider the vector space endowed with its canonical khler structure @xmath144 , we can further characterize @xmath89 as being the hamiltonian vector field corresponding to the function @xmath145 :    @xmath89 is the hamiltonian vector field corresponding to the quadratic function associated with the identity operator .",
    "the vector fields @xmath90 and @xmath89 commute and therefore define an involutive distribution , hence we can consider the foliation defined by such vector fields .",
    "the corresponding quotient manifold , is again the complex projective space @xmath146 .",
    "this remark allows us to consider projectable tensorial quantities .",
    "for instance , we have :    for each hermitian operator @xmath7 , the expectation value function , defined as @xmath147 is invariant under @xmath90 and @xmath89 .",
    "but hence we proved :    the space of the expectation values functions of hermitian operators projects onto the quotient space defined by the foliation generated by @xmath90 and @xmath89 .",
    "a general operator , dynamical variable , can be decomposed into real and imaginary parts , both parts given by hermitian operators .",
    "therefore we can say that both parts project onto the complex projective space .      in the ` geometrized ' hilbert space description we have to recover now the description of the ` eigenvectors ' and ` eigenvalues ' .",
    "to this aim is appropriate to introduce expectation values associated with hermitian operators , @xmath148 : @xmath149    we find that :    1 .",
    "critical points of @xmath150 correspond to the eigenvectors of @xmath7 .",
    "values of @xmath151 at critical points are the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath7 .",
    "critical points of @xmath150 coincide with the critical points of the corresponding hamiltonian vector field @xmath152 or of the corresponding gradient vector field @xmath153 .",
    "we have seen that in our geometrization the algebra of observables can be recovered in terms of functions with the help of the contravariant tensors @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we noticed that expectation value functions are projectable and therefore it makes sense to consider the binary products @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "unfortunately , because of @xmath124 and @xmath156 the result of those operations on projectable functions will not be projectable .",
    "thus , in order to make them inner operations , we may use a conformal factor for both tensors , as , for instance @xmath157 and @xmath158 . in this way we would define projectable tensors , and hence inner products of projectable functions .",
    "a new problem arises though : if we define the bracket corresponding to the skew - symmetric part @xmath159 this new bracket does not satisfy the jacobi identity . indeed , to make it to satisfy the jacobi identity we have to consider a jacobi bracket instead of a poisson one , in the form @xmath160=\\ { f , h\\}_p+fl_{x}h - hl_xf,\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is the hamiltonian vector field associated with the function @xmath162 .",
    "now , for the expectation values function we find that @xmath163=\\ { e_a , e_b\\ } _ p\\,,\\qquad \\forall a , b,\\ ] ] because the function @xmath162 is a central element for the subalgebra generated by the expectation value functions .",
    "therefore , the use of the conformal tensors @xmath164 and @xmath165 allows us to define a @xmath12-algebra structure on the space of expectation value functions , which are projectable onto the complex projective space .    by explicit computation it is possible to show that @xmath166    if we consider the projection @xmath167 we may identify @xmath168 with the subalgebra of @xmath129 satisfying the conditions",

    "then , we have :    let @xmath202 be the space of observables of a finite level quantum system .",
    "then , @xmath203 can be endowed with a poisson structure .",
    "having replaced the lie algebra structure with the poisson tensor associated with the poisson bracket on @xmath197 , we are now able to perform also nonlinear transformations on the poisson manifold .",

    "we obtain a linear function as the product of other two linear ones , but in general it will be a complex valued function even if the factors were real ones .",

    "we can even consider the non - local product , for instance we get @xmath227    it is also easy to see that the hamiltonian vector fields associated with linear functions provide derivations both for the point - wise product and for the non - local product .",

    "moreover , * @xmath247 , @xmath248 . * @xmath249 and @xmath250 . * @xmath251 and for the other mapping @xmath252    had we started with the heisenberg picture , we would be able to reconstruct the hilbert space description by means of the gelfand  naimark  segal ( gns ) construction @xcite .",
    "this requires the choice of a state ( a functional on the algebra of observables ) .",
    "when the chosen state is pure , the representation will be irreducible .",
    "the hilbert space associated with a pure state would play exactly the same role that our hilbert space @xmath11 has played for the schrdinger picture . in this case",
    "the corresponding momentum map @xmath245 would provide us with a symplectic realization of the poisson manifold @xmath242 ( with the lie - poisson structure ) .",

    "we would like to emphasize that the gns construction brings in the quantum theory an entirely new framework that the traditional schrdinger formalism is lacking of .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hilbert space on which the observables act as operators is not a perennial feature of the theory , nor of the model to be constructed , but it is dependent on the state or preparation of the system under consideration . in other terms , as the state is prepared by the observer , the corresponding hilbert space with the associated representation of the @xmath12-algebra is ` selected ' by the observer .    in concluding this section we notice that the geometrical version we have presented allows us to put the schrdinger and the heisenberg pictures within an unified framework of hilbert spaces , actions of the unitary group and its associated momentum maps .",
    "the gns construction may be given the nice geometrical description of the construction of a symplectic realization of the poisson manifold @xmath242 , which in turn can be considered as a generalization to arbitrary dimension of the jordan  schwinger map .",
    "for completeness , let us expose a little more our considerations on the space of states :      we have seen how the momentum map @xmath258 allows us to embed the complex projective space @xmath259 on the dual of the lie algebra @xmath260 .",
    "the resulting elements represent the set of pure states of the quantum system .",
    "but in many physical situations we have more general states , i.e. density states which are convex combinations of pure states .",
    "they are represented by a family @xmath261 , each element satisfying @xmath262 along with a probability vector , namely @xmath263 with @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "out of these we construct a density state @xmath266 .",
    "the evaluation of this state on some observable @xmath7 is given by @xmath267    we shall call * density states * to the set @xmath268 of all convex combinations of pure states @xcite .",
    "as any of the elements in @xmath269 can be embedded into @xmath270 , it makes perfect sense to consider @xmath269 also as an element in the dual of the unitary algebra .",
    "and we hence consider the geometric structure we defined on @xmath270 as the poisson or the jordan brackets @xmath271_-}(\\psi_k ) = \\sum_kp_k\\ { f_a , f_b\\ } ( \\psi _ k ) \\nonumber    \\\\",

    "the phase - space formulation of quantum mechanics has a long history .",
    "see @xcite for further details . as it stands nowadays",
    ", we may identify two basic independent ideas behind this formulation :    * the first one , due to weyl , emerged from the desire to ` quantize ' classical systems by using bounded operators ( one - parameter groups of unitary operators instead of their infinitesimal generators which would create domain problems due to their unboundness , see for instance wintner s theorem in @xcite . by a clever use of the fourier transform ,",
    "weyl @xcitewas able to set up a rule that maps a classical dynamical variable ( a function on phase - space ) onto a corresponding operator for the quantum system in a linear manner .",
    "* the second idea is due to wigner @xcite who associated a phase - space distribution with each quantum state .",
    "this was motivated by the statistical properties of the states , in the way we mentioned in the introduction .",
    "it was moyal who discovered @xcite that the weyl correspondence rule can be inverted by the wigner map and therefore that the two approaches were exactly inverse of one another .",
    "as a result , the quantum expectation value of an operator can be represented in a classical - looking form as a statistical average of the corresponding phase - space function . in this way",
    ", quantum mechanics can be represented as a ` statistical theory ' on the classical phase - space .",
    "it should be mentioned , though , that as a function on the classical phase - space the wigner distribution ( associated with hermitian operators ) is real but not necessarily point - wise non - negative , and thus it can not be interpreted as a true probability distribution .",
    "the occurrence of negative values for the wigner function associated with states is closely related to the impossibility of simultaneously measuring conjugated variables ( as position and momenta ) .",
    "we consider a phase - space defined by a symplectic vector space @xmath274 , with symplectic structure @xmath68 .",
    "a * weyl map * is a ( strongly ) continuous map from @xmath275 to the set of unitary operators on some hilbert space @xmath11 : @xmath276 such that @xmath277 for any pair of vectors @xmath278 .",
    "the symbol @xmath279 stands for the identity operator on the hilbert space @xmath11 .",

    "it is clear that the existence of a vector space structure on @xmath275 plays no role and hence we can generalize this construction to an arbitrary manifold .",

    "the difference between classical and quantum mechanics may now emerge more neatly because both theories are written in terms of the same vector space of functions ( @xmath337 ) .",
    "the difference lies on the product we consider on that set : the point - wise product is appropriate for classical mechanics , while this new product @xmath183 is appropriate for quantum mechanics .",

    "it is now possible to write the equations of motion of a quantum dynamical system on phase space . consider thus a quantum system evolving on the space of density matrices , thus defining a curve @xmath396    the quadratic function corresponding to an operator @xmath7 in the evolution of the state @xmath397 defines a curve on the space of quadratic functions @xmath398    by using the corresponding wigner function , we can write : @xmath399 here we denote by @xmath400 the wigner function corresponding to an arbitrary time @xmath92 .",
    "this raises the question on the definition of these ` time - dependent ' wigner functions .",
    "we can summarize their properties as follows :    * @xmath401 this can also be written as @xmath402 .",
    "* we have @xmath403\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] * and @xmath404 this inequality captures the uncertainty relations .",
    "the equations of motion for the wigner function follow from von neumann equation on states @xmath405.\\ ] ]    in weyl ",
    "wigner representation we find thus : @xmath406 where @xmath407 is the weyl transform of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "then if we write the ` inner derivation ' associated with this hamiltonian ` function ' we obtain : @xmath408\\ ] ] we can thus write : @xmath409    a formal solution for this equation can always be written in the exponential form @xmath410    consider for instance a hamiltonian of mechanical type , i.e. @xmath411    th equation above becomes @xmath412    thus if we consider the classical limit by considering @xmath393 we obtain that the limit of the von neumann equation written in terms of the wigner function becomes : @xmath413 i.e. the classical hamilton equations .",
    "let us recall very briefly what a classical bi - hamiltonian system is . for more details the interested reader",
    "is addressed to @xcite . on the space of functions ( observables )",
    "@xmath337 , a dynamical system @xmath89 is bi - hamiltonian if there exist two poisson brackets and two hamiltonian functions such that the corresponding hamilton vector fields coincide with @xmath89 , i .. e @xmath414 in terms of poisson bi - vector fields we have @xmath415    when besides this @xmath416 is a skew - symmetric tensor defining a new poisson bracket , the two poisson structures are said to be * compatible*.    going over to quantum mechanics , it seems natural to try to imitate the same definition , taking into account that this time one has , in addition to the poisson structure @xmath207 , a riemannian tensor @xmath72 .",
    "we define thus :    consider two khler structures @xmath417 and @xmath418 . a dynamical system @xmath89 is said to be * bi - khlerian * if it preserves all the tensors : @xmath419 this already implies that @xmath420 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that these two admissible ( i.e. invariant ) hermitian tensors are * compatible * if they give rise to the same complex structure , i.e. @xmath421    from these two inner products on the hilbert space , we find that the ` row - by - column ' product ( i.e. the corresponding coordinate expression ) will change by means of the insertion of a positive matrix @xmath422 : @xmath423    thus on the space of matrices ( operators ) the induced alternative product becomes : @xmath424    this implies that the heisenberg picture we get two alternative descriptions of the dynamics : @xmath425=[a , h_k]_k.\\ ] ] thus : @xmath426 thus we obtain an obvious solution @xmath427    for it to be admissible we need @xmath428=0\\,.\\ ] ] for general considerations , see @xcite .",
    "from here it is possible to carry on the analysis of bi - khlerian dynamics ( quantum dynamics ) along the same lines of the classical situation .    assuming that both poisson structures give rise to the corresponding symplectic structures ( i.e. both are non - degenerate )",
    ", we can construct the corresponding weyl systems and the corresponding wigner ",
    "weyl formalisms .",
    "the corresponding quantum dynamics : @xmath429    by considering the deformed associative product in the form @xmath430 we find @xmath431    this implies that in the ` classical limit ' the symmetric bracket becomes @xmath432 while the skew - symmetric part becomes : @xmath433 thus the classical limit is not a poisson bracket but a jacobi bracket .",
    "we may also remark that linearly related alternative symplectic structures give rise to poisson brackets which are always compatible .",
    "therefore , to obtain classical limits ( of alternative products on the space of operators ) which are not compatible we have to consider nonlinear transformations also at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the ` heisenberg cut ' when we describe a quantum system ; it may be necessary to associate the hilbert space structure or the associative product structure of the space of operators with the ` apparatus ' rather than with the ` object ' .",
    "in this survey we have presented a brief description of the different tools that differential geometry offers to describe quantum mechanical systems .",
    "we show , first , the necessity of going beyond classical mechanics to describe microscopic physical systems ; and , at the same time , we obtain a series of properties which the new description must provide . we have studied the three most common approaches to quantum mechanics , schrdinger , heisenberg and wigner - weyl from a geometrical perspective . in the two first cases we have seen",
    "that a khler structure and a lie - jordan structure arise naturally and play a decisive role in the description of the dynamics .",
    "we proved also that the schrdinger and the heisenberg pictures are related via the momentum map associated to the symplectic action of the unitary group on the set of states of our system . in what regards the weyl - wigner formalism",
    ", we provided an abstract description of its construction , and proved why it is the most suitable approach to study the quantum - classical transition .",
    "finally , in a very concise way , we discussed how the identification of the geometric structures that we just mentioned above allows us to generalize the concept of bi - hamiltonian classical structures to the quantum domain , by considering more than one khler structure ( in the schrdinger representation ) or different associative products on the algebra of observables ( in the heisenberg picture ) .",
