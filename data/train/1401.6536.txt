    "a self - shuffling word , a notion which was recently introduced by charlier et al .",
    "@xcite , is an infinite word that can be reproduced by shuffling it with itself .",
    "more formally , given infinite words @xmath4 over a finite alphabet @xmath5 we define @xmath6 to be the collection of all infinite words @xmath7 for which there exists a factorization @xmath8 with each @xmath9 and with @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "an infinite word @xmath12 is _ self - shuffling _ if @xmath13 .",
    "various well - known words , e.g. , the thue - morse word or the fibonacci word , were shown to be self - shuffling .",
    "harju @xcite studied shuffles of both finite and infinite square - free words , i.e. , words that have no factor of the form @xmath14 for some non - empty factor @xmath15 .",
    "more results on square - free shuffles were obtained independently by harju and mller @xcite , and currie and saari @xcite .",
    "however , the question about the existence of an infinite square - free self - shuffling word , posed in @xcite , remained open .",
    "we give a positive answer to this question in sections 2  and  3 .",
    "the _ shift orbit closure _ @xmath16 of an infinite word @xmath0 can be defined , e.g. , as the set of infinite words whose sets of factors are contained in the set of factors of @xmath0 . in @xcite it has been proved that each word has a non - self - shuffling word in its shift orbit closure , and the following question has been asked : does there exist a word for which no element of its shift orbit closure is self - shuffling ( question 7.2 ) ? in section 4 we provide a positive answer to the question . more generally , we show the existence of a word such that for any three words @xmath17 in its shift orbit closure , if @xmath18 is a shuffle of @xmath19 and @xmath7 , then the three words are pairwise different . on the other hand , we show that for any infinite word there exist three different words @xmath17 in its shift orbit closure such that @xmath20 ( see proposition  [ prop_xyz ] ) .",
    "apart from the usual concepts in combinatorics on words , which can be found for instance in the book of lothaire @xcite , we make use of the following notations : for every @xmath21 , we denote the alphabet @xmath22 by @xmath23 . for a word @xmath24",
    "we say that @xmath15 is a _ prefix _ of @xmath0 , @xmath25 is a _ factor _ of @xmath0 , and @xmath7 is a _ suffix _ of @xmath0 .",
    "we denote these prefix- and suffix relations by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . by @xmath28",
    "$ ] we denote the factor of @xmath0 starting at position @xmath29 and ending after position @xmath30 .",
    "note that we start numbering the positions with @xmath31 .",
    "a _ prefix code _ is a set of words with the property that none of its elements is a prefix of another element .",
    "similarly , a _ suffix code _ is a set of words where no element is a suffix of another one .",
    "bifix code _ is a set that is both a prefix code and a suffix code .",
    "a morphism @xmath32 is _ square - free _",
    "if for all square - free words @xmath0 , the image @xmath33 is square - free .",
    "let @xmath34 be the morphism defined as follows : @xmath35    we will show that the fixed point @xmath36 is square - free and self - shuffling in the following . note that @xmath37 is not a square - free morphism , that is , it does not preserve square - freeness , as @xmath38 contains the square @xmath39 .",
    "[ no_3u1u3 ] the word @xmath36 contains no factor of the form @xmath40 for some @xmath41 .",
    "we assume that there exists a factor of the form @xmath40 in @xmath0 , for some word @xmath41 . from the definition of @xmath37",
    ", we observe that @xmath15 can not be empty .",
    "furthermore , we see that every @xmath42 in @xmath0 is preceded by either @xmath31 or @xmath43 . if @xmath44 , then we had an occurrence of the factor @xmath45 in @xmath0 , which is not possible by the definition of @xmath37 , hence @xmath46 .",
    "now , every @xmath42 is followed by either @xmath31 or @xmath47 in @xmath0 and @xmath48 is followed by either @xmath47 or @xmath42 .",
    "since both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are factors of @xmath0 , we must have @xmath51 .",
    "this means that the factor @xmath52 appears at the center of @xmath53 , which can only be followed by @xmath43 in @xmath0 , thus @xmath54 .",
    "however , this results in the factor @xmath55 as a prefix of @xmath40 , which does not appear in @xmath0 , as seen from the definition of @xmath37 .",
    "the word @xmath36 is square - free .",
    "we first observe that @xmath56 is a bifix code .",
    "furthermore , we can verify that there are no squares @xmath14 with @xmath57 in @xmath0 .",
    "let us assume now , that the square @xmath14 appears in @xmath0 and that @xmath15 is the shortest word with this property .",
    "if @xmath58 , then @xmath59 must hold , since @xmath60 appears only as a factor of @xmath61 , and thus @xmath14 is a suffix of the factor @xmath62 in @xmath0 . as @xmath63 , also the shorter square @xmath64 appears in @xmath0 , a contradiction .",
    "the same desubstitution principle also leads to occurrences of shorter squares in @xmath0 if @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    if @xmath67 then either @xmath68 or @xmath69 or @xmath70 , by the definition of @xmath37 . in the last case , that is when @xmath70 , we must have @xmath54 , which is covered by the previous paragraph .",
    "if @xmath71 , then @xmath14 is followed by @xmath47 in @xmath0 and we can desubstitute to obtain the shorter square @xmath72 in @xmath0 . if @xmath67 and @xmath59 , and @xmath14 is preceded by @xmath73 or followed by @xmath47 in @xmath0 , we can desubstitute to @xmath74 or @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "therefore , assume that @xmath76 and @xmath14 is preceded by @xmath77 and followed by @xmath60 in @xmath0 .",
    "this however means that we can desubstitute to get an occurrence of the factor @xmath78 in @xmath0 , a contradiction to lemma [ no_3u1u3 ] .",
    "we now show that @xmath36 can be written as @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "the word @xmath36 is self - shuffling .    in what follows we use the notation",
    "@xmath81 meaning that @xmath82 for finite words @xmath83 .",
    "we are going to show that the self - shuffle is given by the following :    @xmath84    now we verify that @xmath85 from which it follows that @xmath0 is self - shuffling .",
    "it suffices to show that each of the above products is fixed by @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , straightforward computations show that    @xmath86    which is fixed by @xmath37 :    @xmath87    hence @xmath88 is fixed by @xmath37 and thus @xmath89 . in a similar way",
    "we show that @xmath90 .",
    "we remark that we can immediately produce a square - free self - shuffling word over @xmath91 from @xmath92 : charlier et al .",
    "@xcite noticed that the property of being self - shuffling is preserved by the application of a morphism .",
    "furthermore , brandenburg @xcite showed that the morphism @xmath93 , defined by @xmath94 is square - free .",
    "therefore , the word @xmath95 is a ternary square - free self - shuffling word , from which we can produce a multitude of others by applying square - free morphisms from @xmath96 to @xmath96 .",
    "in this section we provide a positive answer to the question from @xcite whether there exists a word for which no element of its shift orbit closure is self - shuffling .    the _ hall word _ @xmath97 is defined as the fixed point of the morphism @xmath98 .",
    "sometimes it is referred to as a _",
    "ternary thue - morse _ word .",
    "it is well known that this word is square - free .",
    "we show that no word in the shift orbit closure @xmath99 of the hall word is self - shuffling .",
    "more generally , we show that if @xmath18 is a shuffle of @xmath19 and @xmath7 for @xmath100 , then they are pairwise different .",
    "[ prop_xyy ] there are no words @xmath101 in the shift orbit closure of the hall word such that @xmath102 .",
    "suppose the converse , i.e. , there exist words @xmath103 such that    @xmath104    define the set @xmath105 of infinite words as follows :    @xmath106 in other words , @xmath105 consists of words in @xmath99 which can be introduced as a shuffle of some word @xmath19 in @xmath99 with itself .",
    "now suppose , for the sake of contradiction , that @xmath105 is non empty , and consider @xmath107 with the first block @xmath108 of the smallest possible positive length .",
    "we remark that such @xmath18 and corresponding @xmath19 are not necessarily unique .",
    "we can suppose without loss of generality that @xmath19 starts with @xmath31 or @xmath109 . otherwise , we exchange @xmath31 and @xmath47 , consider the morphism @xmath110 , and the argument is symmetric .",
    "it is not hard to see from the properties of the morphism @xmath32 that removing every occurrence of @xmath43 from @xmath19 results in @xmath111 . hence the blocks in the factorizations of @xmath19 after removal of @xmath43 are of the form @xmath112 for some integer @xmath29 .",
    "thus the first letter of each block @xmath2 and @xmath3 that is different from @xmath43 is @xmath31 , and the last letter different from @xmath43 is @xmath47",
    ".    then , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are images by the morphism @xmath32 of factors of the fixed point of @xmath32",
    ". therefore , there are words @xmath113 such that @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "notice that the first block @xmath108 can not be equal to @xmath43 . indeed , otherwise @xmath18 starts with @xmath45 , which is impossible , since @xmath45 is not a factor of the fixed point of @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , taking the preimage decreases the lengths of blocks in the factorization ( except for those equal to @xmath43 ) , and since @xmath117 , the length of the first block in the preimage is smaller , i.e. , @xmath118 .",
    "this is a contradiction with the minimality of @xmath119 .",
    "there are no self - shuffling words in the shift orbit closure of @xmath120 .    with a similar argument we can prove the following :    [ prop_xxy ] there are no words @xmath101 in the shift orbit closure of @xmath120 such that @xmath121 .",
    "first we introduce a notation @xmath122 , meaning that there exists a shuffle starting with the word @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) .",
    "next , @xmath125 implies that there exists @xmath7 in the same shift orbit closure such that @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , one can remove the prefix @xmath108 of @xmath18 to get @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath127 , and keep all the other blocks @xmath2 , @xmath3 in the shuffle product .    define the set @xmath128 of infinite words as follows :    @xmath129 in other words , @xmath128 consists of words in @xmath99 which can be introduced as a shuffle of some word @xmath19 in @xmath99 with @xmath7 starting with the block @xmath130 . now consider @xmath131 with the first block @xmath130 of the smallest possible length .",
    "we remark that such @xmath7 and a corresponding @xmath19 are not necessarily unique .    as in the proof of proposition [ prop_xyy ] ,",
    "the shuffle can not start with a block of length @xmath43 .",
    "again , if we remove every occurrence of @xmath43 in @xmath19 ( and in @xmath7 ) , we get @xmath111 or @xmath132 ; moreover , since @xmath130 contains letters different from @xmath43 , the first letter different from @xmath43 is the same in @xmath19 and @xmath7 .",
    "so , without loss of generality we assume that both @xmath19 and @xmath7 without @xmath43 are @xmath111 , and the blocks @xmath2 and @xmath3 without @xmath43 are integer powers of @xmath60",
    ". then , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are images by the morphism @xmath32 of factors of @xmath120",
    ". therefore , there are words @xmath133 such that @xmath134 and @xmath135 , @xmath136 ( i.e. , @xmath137 ) .    as in the proof of proposition [ prop_xyy ] , since @xmath138 , the length of the first block in the preimage is smaller , i.e. , @xmath139 .",
    "this is again a contradiction with the minimality of @xmath140 .",
    "so , we proved that if there are three words @xmath141 in the shift orbit closure of the fixed point of @xmath32 such that @xmath142 , then they should be pairwise distinct .",
    "now we are going to prove that for any infinite word there exist three different words in its shift orbit closure such that @xmath20 .",
    "an infinite word @xmath18 is called _ recurrent _ , if each its prefix occurs infinitely many times in  it .",
    "[ prop_xyz ] let @xmath18 be a recurrent infinite word .",
    "then there exist two words @xmath143 in the shift orbit closure of @xmath18 such that @xmath144 .",
    "we build the shuffle inductively .",
    "start from any prefix @xmath108 of @xmath18 . since @xmath18 is recurrent , each of its prefixes occurs infinitely many times in it .",
    "find another occurrence of @xmath108 in @xmath18 and denote its position by @xmath145 .",
    "put @xmath146 $ ] .    at step",
    "@xmath147 , suppose that the shuffle of the prefix of @xmath18 is built : @xmath148=\\prod_{l=0}^{k-1 } u_l v_l , \\quad y[0 , \\sigma_{l=0}^{k-1}|u_l|-1]=\\prod_{l=0}^{k-1 } u_l , \\quad z[0 , \\sigma_{l=0}^{k-1 } |v_l|-1]=\\prod_{l=0}^{k-1 } v_l,\\ ] ] such that @xmath149 is the suffix of @xmath150=\\prod_{i=0}^{k-1 } u_l v_l$ ] starting at position @xmath151 , and @xmath152 is the suffix of @xmath150=\\prod_{i=0}^{k-1 } u_l v_l$ ] starting at position @xmath153 .",
    "find another occurrence of @xmath152 in @xmath18 at some position @xmath154 .",
    "we can do it since @xmath18 is recurrent .",
    "put @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "we note that @xmath156 is a factor of @xmath18 by the construction ; more precisely , it occurs at position @xmath151 .",
    "find an occurrence of @xmath156 at some position @xmath157 , put @xmath158 is a factor of @xmath18 by the construction since it occurs at position @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , both @xmath156 and @xmath159 are suffixes of @xmath160=\\prod_{i=0}^{k } u_l v_l$ ] .",
    "continuing this line of reasoning , we build the required factorization .",
    "since each infinite word contains a recurrent ( actually , even a uniformly recurrent ) word in its shift orbit closure , we obtain the following corollary :    [ col : xyz ] each infinite word @xmath0 contains words @xmath141 in its shift orbit closure such that @xmath20 .    the following example shows that the recurrence condition in proposition [ prop_xyz ] can not be omitted :    consider the word @xmath161 which is obtained from @xmath120 by adding a letter @xmath42 in the beginning .",
    "then the shift orbit closure of @xmath162 consists of the shift orbit closure of @xmath120 and the word @xmath162 itself .",
    "assuming @xmath162 is a shuffle of two words in its shift orbit closure , one of them is @xmath162 ( there are no other @xmath42 s ) and the other one is something in the shift orbit closure of @xmath120 , we let @xmath19 denote this other word . clearly , the shuffle starts with @xmath162 , and cutting the first letter @xmath42 , we get @xmath163 , a contradiction with proposition  [ prop_xxy ] .",
    "there also exist examples where each letter occurs infinitely many times :    the following word : @xmath164 does not have two words @xmath165 in its shift orbit closure such that @xmath142 .",
    "the idea of the proof is that the shift orbit closure consists of words of the following form : @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath18 itself and all their right shifts .",
    "shuffling any two words of those types , it is not hard to see that there exists a prefix of the shuffle which contains too many or too few occurrences of some letter compare to the prefix of @xmath18 .",
    "we leave the details of the proof to the reader .    by corollary  [ col : xyz ] , there are @xmath17 in the shift orbit closure of @xmath120 such that @xmath168 .",
    "to conclude this section , we give an explicit construction of two words in the shift orbit closure of @xmath120 which can be shuffled to give @xmath120 .",
    "we remark though that this construction gives a shuffle different from the one given by corollary  [ col : xyz ] .",
    "let : @xmath169    by definition , the shift orbit closure of the hall word is closed under @xmath32 .",
    "moreover this shift orbit closure is also closed under @xmath170 , since the factors of the hall word are closed under the morphism @xmath171 .",
    "@xmath172 note that if @xmath0 is an infinite word , then @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath175 .",
    "let @xmath176 and for every @xmath177 , @xmath178 let furthermore @xmath179 we show that @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "note that @xmath183 , thus @xmath184 .",
    "then we have @xmath185 moreover , @xmath186 since @xmath187 , the word @xmath188 is the fixed point @xmath189 of @xmath190 , and then @xmath191 is the fixed point @xmath192 .",
    "thus @xmath193 . finally : @xmath194    applying the morphism @xmath32 to the second expression for @xmath0 , we get @xmath195    thus @xmath180 since @xmath32 is injective .",
    "we showed that infinite square - free self - shuffling words exist .",
    "the natural question that arises now is whether we can find infinite self - shuffling words subject to even stronger avoidability constraints : for this we recall the notion of _ repetition threshold _ @xmath196 , which is defined as the least real number such that an infinite word over @xmath23 exists , that does not contain repetitions of exponent greater than @xmath196 .",
    "due to the collective effort of many researchers  ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the repetition threshold for all alphabet sizes is known and characterized as follows : @xmath197 a word @xmath198 without factors of exponent greater than @xmath196 is called a _ dejean word_. charlier et al . showed that the thue - morse word , which is a binary dejean word , is self - shuffling @xcite ."
