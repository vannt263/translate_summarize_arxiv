    "the biomass structure is a fundamental characteristic of ecosystems @xcite .",
    "the shape of biomass pyramids encodes not only the structure of communities , but also integrates functional characteristics of communities , such as patterns of energy flow , transfer efficiency , and turnover of different components of the food web @xcite .",
    "a trophic pyramid is a graphical representation showing the energy or biomass at each trophic level in a closed ecosystem .",
    "energy pyramids illustrate the production or turnover of biomass and the energy flow through the food chain , while biomass pyramids illustrate the biomass or abundance of organisms at each trophic level .",
    "when energy is transferred to the next higher trophic level , typically only 10% is used to build new biomass @xcite and the remainder is consumed by metabolic processes .",
    "hence , in a closed ecosystem , each trophic level of the energy pyramid is roughly 10% smaller than the level below it , and thus inverted _ energy _ pyramids can not exist .",
    "a standard biomass pyramid is found in terrestrial ecosystems such as grassland ecosystems or forest ecosystems , where a larger biomass of producers support a smaller biomass of consumers @xcite .",
    "although they appear to be rare , inverted biomass pyramids exist in nature .",
    "they have been observed in planktonic ecosystems @xcite , where phytoplankton maintain a high production rate and are consumed by longer lived zooplankton and fish .",
    "recently , inverted biomass pyramids have also been observed in pristine coral reefs in the southern line islands and northwest hawaiian islands @xcite , where the benthic coral cover provides refuge for prey fish ( figure [ kingman ] ) .",
    "at least one prominent researcher suspects that an apparent inverted biomass pyramid exists on a reef off the north carolina coast , and he speculates this is due to significant immigration of prey fish into the reef @xcite . in this manuscript",
    ", we introduce three classes of predator - prey models to study how inverted biomass pyramids can arise via these three distinct mechanisms .",
    "most predator - prey models implicitly assume that predators and prey are well mixed , and many incorporate a holling - type predation response @xcite .",
    "although the `` well mixed '' assumption is usually far from being satisfied when prey are animals , it appears to be a reasonable assumption for phytoplankton - herbivore interactions in aquatic ecosystems , and we first discuss the existence of inverted biomass pyramids in this setting .",
    "we begin by considering the standard lotka - volterra predator - prey model with mass - action predation response @xcite , described by the system @xmath0 where @xmath1 the interior equilibrium point @xmath2 is neutrally stable ( a center ) , at which the predator : prey biomass ratio is @xmath3 the ratio is greater than 1 if and only if @xmath4 .",
    "we obtain our first result in biomass pyramid theory :    [ theory1 ] for the model ( [ equ1])-([equ2 ] ) , if @xmath4 ( the prey growth rate multiplied by the conversion efficiency is greater than the predator death rate ) , the biomass pyramid is inverted ; otherwise , the biomass pyramid is standard .",
    "result [ theory1 ] provides a rigorous foundation for the belief expressed by some biologists that inverted biomass pyramids result from the high growth rate of prey and low death rate of predators @xcite .",
    "result [ theory1 ] further suggests that the biomass conversion efficiency can significantly influence the shape of the biomass pyramid .",
    "we now incorporate a general well - mixed predation response into the predator - prey model , which is described by the system @xmath5 where @xmath6 at the interior equilibrium point @xmath7 , the ratio @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "thus the predator : prey biomass ratio is @xmath10 this interior equilibrium point is attracting when the system ( [ equ3])-([equ4 ] ) is eventually bounded and has no stable limit cycles . the system is eventually bounded if there is a bounded region where all solutions eventually enter into and stay in . result [ theory1 ] remains valid for this extended model whenever the interior equilibrium point is stable .",
    "actually , whenever the prey grow exponentially , result [ theory1 ] is robust to variations in refuge - dependent predation patterns .",
    "we now incorporate logistic prey growth into the preceding predator - prey model , which is described by the system @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the predation functional response @xmath13 is a strictly increasing function .",
    "any reasonable predation function must satisfy this monotone condition , which all three holling - type functions do .",
    "the monotonicity implies that the inverse function @xmath14 exists @xcite , and thus the @xmath15-component of the interior equilibrium point can be solved from @xmath16 as @xmath17 .",
    "the biomass ratio at the interior equilibrium point @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19.\\ ] ] this formula modifies the biomass ratio in model ( [ equ1])-([equ2 ] ) and model ( [ equ3])-([equ4 ] ) by the factor @xmath20 .",
    "this interior equilibrium point is attracting when the predator - extinction equilibrium @xmath21 is unstable and there exist no stable limit cycles .",
    "for instance , if @xmath22 is a holling type ii functional response , then the interior equilibrium point is globally attracting whenever @xmath23 . under the stability condition",
    ", we obtain the new result :    [ theory2 ] for the model ( [ equ5])-([equ6 ] ) , if @xmath24>1 $ ] , the biomass pyramid is inverted ; otherwise , the biomass pyramid is standard .",
    "the new condition for the inverted biomass pyramid depends additionally on the prey carrying capacity @xmath25 .",
    "we see that the predator : prey biomass ratio is an increasing function of the prey growth rate ( @xmath26 ) , the conversion efficiency ( @xmath27 ) , and the prey carrying capacity ( @xmath25 ) , while the biomass ratio is a decreasing function of the predator death rate ( @xmath28 ) . as a conclusion",
    ", we have the following result :    [ theory3 ] the increase of prey growth rate , the conversion efficiency , the prey carrying capacity , or the predator life span facilitates the occurrence of inverted biomass pyramids .",
    "result [ theory3 ] is robust whenever the predation function is an increasing function of prey density .",
    "we will see in the next section that the same relations hold for refuge - dependent predation functions .",
    "seeking refuge from predators is a general behavior of most animals in _ natural _ ecosystems @xcite where the refuge habitats can include burrows @xcite , trees @xcite , cliff faces @xcite , thick vegetation @xcite , or rock talus @xcite .",
    "some ecologists even believe that refuges provide a general mechanism for interpreting ecological patterns @xcite , specifically the extent of predator - prey interactions @xcite .",
    "aquatic ecologists have recently observed inverted biomass pyramids in pristine coral reefs , where the benthic coral cover provides the refuge for prey fish @xcite .    in @xcite , we needed to introduce a refuge with explicit size .",
    "although the holling type iii functional response offers the prey a refuge at low population density @xcite , the refuge is only implicit , and one can not specify the size of the refuge . some authors include an explicit refuge size into their models by multiplying the prey density by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a proxy of the refuge size @xcite .",
    "this procedure has two fundamental drawbacks .",
    "the first is that for these modified predation response functions , the switch point , where the predation rate starts to quickly increase , critically depends on both the proxy refuge size and the proxy half - saturation constant ( independent of the refuge size ) .",
    "the latter dependence is undesirable . for our model",
    ", it is important that the switch point be a function of only the refuge size .",
    "the second drawback is that , unlike the holling - type functional responses which are mechanistically derived from basic biological principles , we have seen no derivation in the literature and we are unable to mechanistically derive these functional forms from basic biological principles to incorporate a refuge .",
    "we now introduce a family of predator - prey models with explicit refuge size , which we call * refuge - modulated predator - prey ( rpp ) models*. an important feature of this family is that the switch points for the functional responses depend solely on the size of the refuge .",
    "we group these models into three classes , rpp types i , ii , and iii , depending on the mechanistic dependence of prey availability for predators on the refuge size .",
    "all previous refuge models assume the mechanism behind our type i class .      in our recent work @xcite",
    ", we modeled the biomass of fish in coral reefs .",
    "small fish find refuge in coral reefs by hiding in holes where large predators can not enter @xcite .",
    "this field observation motivated us to incorporate a refuge into the standard predator - prey model , where the coral reef refuge size influences the pattern of predation response .",
    "we introduced the following family of models : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a strictly increasing function of prey biomass density @xmath15 .",
    "for each fixed @xmath34 , the function @xmath35 is strictly increasing in @xmath15 , and thus its inverse @xmath36 exists .",
    "we solve for the @xmath15-component of the interior equilibrium point from @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "the biomass ratio at the interior equilibrium point @xmath39 : @xmath40.\\ ] ] for each fixed refuge size @xmath34 , the relationships between the biomass ratio and other parameters are the same as in the well - mixed predator - prey models .",
    "this provides the robustness of result [ theory3 ] .",
    "additional hypotheses are needed to determine the relationship between the biomass ratio and the refuge size .",
    "although the field observation in @xcite suggests that prey fish hide in refuge places from predators , it is still unclear how the refuge regulates the prey availability for predators . in the next subsection , we propose three hypotheses all motivated from biological considerations .",
    "we model three biological hypotheses on how prey availability for predators depends on the refuge size ( figure [ hypotheses ] ) .",
    "we call these models rpp ( refuge - modulated predator - prey ) type i , type ii , and rpp type iii .",
    "all predation functions depend on the maximum predation rate @xmath41 , the refuge size @xmath34 , the minimum predation rate regulator @xmath42 , and the slope regulator @xmath43 .",
    "* rpp type i * : this model assumes that the prey availability for predators decreases as the refgue size increases .",
    "prey hide in the refuge , but trade - off protection ( i.e. increased survival ) for a decrease in growth or reproduction due to lower quality resources within the refuge @xcite .",
    "thus an increase in the size of the refuge protects more of the prey and results in less prey available to the predator .",
    "thus , the prey availability for predators is the prey density outside the refuge and @xmath33 is a decreasing function of refuge size @xmath34 .",
    "we choose the following representive function that can be fitted to empirical data : @xmath44 the variable @xmath15 is the total prey density ( per unit area ) and thus the prey availability for predators is @xmath45 .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 captures the minimum predation rate as follows : when no prey and no refuge are available , the predation rate is @xmath46 , which is the minimum predation rate",
    ". we should choose @xmath42 sufficiently large such that @xmath47 , since it is reasonable to have a small predation rate when no prey are available .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 determines the slope of the predation curve when @xmath15 is close to @xmath34 .",

    "the interior equilibrium point only exists when @xmath49 . to see this , if @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then @xmath52 , and thus predators go extinct since all solutions tend to the boundary equilibrium point @xmath21 .",
    "biologically , when the maximum predation rate multiplied by the conversion efficiency is less than the predator death rate , one would expect that predators can not persist . under the conditions that @xmath42 is sufficiently large and @xmath49",
    ", the term @xmath53 $ ] is negative .",
    "hence , @xmath48 = \\boxed{r+\\frac{1}{\\xi}\\ln\\frac{\\beta d}{bc - d}>0}$ ] for sufficiently large @xmath42 .",
    "the evidence for the presence of trade - offs ( survival vs. growth or reproduction ) with the use of refuges is plentiful @xcite .",
    "however , we are aware of only one experimental example that shows a decrease in growth rate of the predator in response to the use of a refuge by the prey @xcite .",
    "* rpp type ii * : this model assumes that the prey availability for predators is independent of the refuge size ( in the sense of density , per unit area ) , i.e. @xmath33 is a constant function of @xmath34 .",
    "prey biomass within the refuge may increase , but the amount available to the predators remains the same .",
    "we choose our representative rpp type ii predation function : @xmath54 the variable @xmath15 is the prey density , and the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 have the same meanings as in rpp type i. the @xmath15-component of the interior equilibrium point is @xmath55 for @xmath49 and sufficiently large @xmath42 .    we know of no biological examples of rpp type ii",
    "however , we believe that rpp types i and iii are the extremes of a continuum , suggesting that condition can exist where the prey available to predators is not affected by the area within the refuge .",
    "* rpp type iii * : this model assumes that the prey availability for predators increases as the refuge size increases .",
    "this may occur when resources such as food and mating sites are available within the refuge , allowing the prey to increase in numbers until some limiting resource forces a number of the prey to emigrate from the refuge in search for new habitat .",
    "the number of immigrants should be positively related to refuge size .",
    "thus , @xmath33 is an increasing function of @xmath34 .",
    "our representative rpp type iii predation function looks quite similar to our type i predation function , but the parameters require different interpretations : @xmath56 the variable @xmath15 is the exterior ( out of refuge ) prey density ( per unit area ) , and @xmath57 is the total prey density ( per unit area ) .",
    "this model assumes that the refuge stores a substantial amount of prey and constantly provides food to predators , and thus the prey availability is the total prey density ( per unit area ) , i.e. @xmath57 .    for @xmath49 and @xmath42 sufficiently large such that @xmath58 , the @xmath15-component of the interior equilibrium point is @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "the threshold refuge size @xmath61 for @xmath49 and sufficiently large @xmath42 . because the refuge size in the model is measured by density ( per unit area )",
    ", it is biologically reasonable to assume a threshold maximum value for the refuge size .",
    "the elk refuge in yellowstone national park is one example of a rpp type iii .",
    "the elk refuge provides protection ( and food ) to the elk during winter increasing survival to 97% @xcite .",
    "the surviving elk migrate out of the refuge and provide a source of food for predators in yellowstone national park and surrounding areas @xcite .",
    "our rpp type iii is also analogous to spillover and larval export hypotheses in marine protected areas ( mpa ) @xcite .",
    "mpa s are areas of the ocean that are protected from fishing ( i.e. man is the predator ) .",
    "the fish within these mpa s are hypothesized to increase the number of fish ( prey ) available outside the protected area through two mechanisms .",
    "the first , spillover , occurs when adult fish become crowded within the mpa and immigrate into the surrounding area .",
    "the second occurs when the fish within the mpa increase their reproductive output , increasing the number of recruits available to surrounding areas ( larval export ) .",
    "while support for the spillover hypothesis is present ( though limited spatially ) , it is much harder to prove the benefits of larval export @xcite .",
    "we now make a couple of general remarks about the rpp - type functional responses .",
    "we always assume that @xmath62 and small , i.e. for each fixed @xmath34 , the predation rate at zero prey density is positive , but minimal . for holling - type responses , @xmath63 .",
    "we believe our choice is reasonable , since when the main prey species are no longer available , predators may temporarily switch to alternative lower quality food sources @xcite .",
    "thus , one must choose @xmath42 sufficiently large such that @xmath47 .",
    "if we fit this predation function to empirical data , @xmath43 may need to be chosen large , depending on the size of @xmath42 .",
    "when the prey availability is high , @xmath33 is close to the maximum predation rate @xmath41 .",
    "mathematically , the refuge size @xmath34 solely determines the shift of the predation curve .      in this subsection ,",
    "we use ( [ ratio4 ] ) to analyze the effects of the refuge size on the predater : prey biomass ratio .",
    "it is evident that the biomass ratio in ( [ ratio4 ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath64 .    for rpp type i ,",
    "the term @xmath65 is an increasing function of the refuge size @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the predator : prey biomass ratio at the interior equilibrium point is a decreasing function of the refuge size @xmath34 .    for rpp type ii , the predator : prey biomass ratio is independent of the refuge size .    for rpp",
    "type iii , the term @xmath66 , is decreasing as the refuge size @xmath34 increases .",
    "thus , the predator : prey biomass ratio at the interior equilibrium point is an increasing function of the refuge size @xmath34 .    the following results immediately follow from these observations :    [ theory4 ] for the model ( [ equ7])-([equ8 ] ) , if @xmath67>1 $ ] , the biomass pyramid is inverted ; otherwise , the biomass pyramid is standard .",
    "[ theory5 ] for rpp type i , the decrease of the refuge size facilitates the occurrence of inverted biomass pyramids . for rpp type ii",
    ", the refuge size has no effects on biomass pyramids . for rpp",
    "type iii , the increase of the refuge size facilitates the occurrence of inverted biomass pyramids .    as an illustrative example , data from kingman and palmyra @xcite suggests that the predator - prey biomass ratio is an increasing function of the refuge size ( equivalent to the benthic coral cover ) , and thus the appropriate predation response function is rpp type iii .",
    "rpp type iii may be biologically appropriate if increases in refuge size either increase recruitment or increase the survival of recruits @xcite .",
    "after the surviving recruits grow into juveniles or adults , they leave the refuge and provide an increase in the food available to the predators .",
    "reef ecologists observed significant immigration of prey fish in a north carolina reef @xcite .",
    "we consider two types of immigration : ( i ) immigrating prey fish stay in the coral reef and adapt to survive in the new habitat ; ( ii ) immigrating prey fish leave the coral reef if they are not eaten by hungry predators , i.e. they provide additional food to predators but do not add to the local prey population . in this section ,",
    "we incorporate both types of immigration into the lotka - volterra predator - prey model :    \\(i ) @xmath68 ( ii ) @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the constant immigration rate . for case ( i ) , the predator : prey biomass ratio at the interior equilibrium point @xmath18 is @xmath71 for case ( ii ) , the predator : prey biomass ratio at the interior equilibrium point @xmath7 is @xmath72 in both immigration cases",

    "we develop a theory of biomass pyramids .",
    "our major contributions can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , when prey grow exponentially , the biomass pyramid is inverted if and only if the prey growth rate multiplied by the conversion efficiency is greater than the predator death rate .",
    "second , the increase of prey growth rate , the conversion efficiency , the prey carrying capacity , or the predator life span robustly facilitates the development of inverted biomass pyramids .",
    "third , based on plausible biological hypotheses , we introduce a new series of predator - prey models ( called rpp type models ) which explicitly and naturally incorporates a prey refuge .",
    "fourth , depending on the nature of an ecosystem , the occurrence of inverted biomass pyramids can be positively or negatively related to , or independent of , the refuge size .",
    "fifth , the immigration of prey facilitates the occurrence of inverted biomass pyramids .",
    "we propose three new refuge - dependent predation functions with explicit refuge size , which capture the three essential biological hypotheses on the refuge ( figure [ hypotheses ] ) .",
    "the three can be combined into one function @xmath73}},\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the index of rpp type , that is , @xmath75 for rpp type i , @xmath76 for rpp type ii , and @xmath77 for rpp type iii .    some , but not all , of the prey that hide in the refuge are available to predators . thus , there should be a discount rate for the refuge size in the predation function of either rpp type i ( assume no prey in the refuge are available ) or rpp type iii ( assume all prey in the refuge are available ) .",
    "we incorporate this discount rate into the general refuge - dependent predation function : @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this model is close to rpp type i if @xmath80 , close to rpp type ii if @xmath81 , and close to rpp type iii if @xmath82 .",
    "we call @xmath83 as the refuge - effect parameter .    what characteristics of the prey might lead to rpp type i versus rpp type iii ?",
    "as stated above , rpp type i will occur when the use of the refuge results in strong trade - offs between survival and reproduction or growth .",
    "most previous theoretical models assume that the hypothesis for rpp type i is the case ; however , we hypothesize that rpp type iii will occur when the prey have the ability to reproduce within the refuge and/or when the refuge increases prey survival through a population bottleneck .",
    "prey animals seek refuges to hide from predators and thus it is sometimes necessary to explicitly incorporate the refuge mechanism into the predation function of predator - prey models .",
    "the family of rpp - type models explicitly incorporating the refuge size can more accurately describe realistic predator - prey interactions in ecosystems .",
