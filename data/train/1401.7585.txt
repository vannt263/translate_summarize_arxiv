    "the problem of light scattering by particles of one medium embedded in another has a long history , dating back more than a century to the classical exact solution due to mie  @xcite .",

    "t_matrix ansatz that has been widely used in the related problem of light scattering by nonspherical particles  @xcite .",
    "more recently this strategy has been successfully applied to optically anisotropic particles  @xcite .    in its original form",
    "the mie theory assumes that the scatterer is illuminated with a plane electromagnetic wave . for laser beams , it is generally necessary to go beyond the plane - wave approximation that may severely break down when the beam width becomes of order of the scatterer size .",
    "the problem of light scattering from arbitrary shaped laser beams has now a more than two decade long history  @xcite and has been the key subject of the mie  type theory    the so - called _ generalized lorenz",
    " mie theory _ ( glmt )  @xcite    extended to the case of arbitrary incident - beam scattering .",
    "mathematically , in such generalization of the mie theory , the central and the most important task is to describe illuminating beams in terms of expansions over a set of basis wavefunctions ( for the spherical coordinate system , it is the multipole expansion over the basis of vector spherical wavefunctions ) . in glmt",
    ", a variety of formally exact ( the quadrature and double quadrature formulas ) and approximate ( the finite series and localized approximations ) methods  @xcite were developed to evaluate the expansion coefficients that are referred to as the _ beam shape coefficients _ ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the central problem with laser beams is due to the fact that in their standard mathematical form these beams are not radiation fields which are solutions to maxwell s equations .",
    "typically , the analytical treatment of laser beams is performed using the paraxial approximation  @xcite and the beams are described as pseudo - fields which are only approximate solutions of the vector helmholtz equation ( higher order corrections can be used to improve the accuracy of the paraxial approximation  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , multipole expansions do not exist for such approximate pseudo - fields .",
    "therefore , some remodelling procedure must be invoked to obtain a real radiation field which can be regarded as an approximation to the original paraxial beam .",
    "the basic concept that might be called _ matching the fields on a surface _ lies at the heart of various traditional approaches to the laser beam remodelling and is based on the assumption that there is a surface where the actual incident field is equal to the paraxial field .",
    "examples of physically reasonable and natural choice are scatterer - independent matching surfaces such as a far - field sphere  @xcite , the focal plane ( for beams with well - defined focal planes )  @xcite , and a gaussian reference sphere representing a lens  @xcite .",
    "given the paraxial field distribution on the matching surface , the beam shape coefficients can be evaluated using either numerical integration or the one - point matching method  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to describe analytically propagation of a laser beam , which is known in the paraxial limit , without recourse to the paraxial approximation . in refs .",

    "spherical and spheroidal particles illuminated with lg beams  @xcite , the analytical results of ref .",
    "@xcite were used to calculate the beam shape coefficients .",
    "it is now well known  @xcite that lg beams represent optical vortex beams that carry angular momentum of two kinds : spin angular momentum associated with the polarization state of the beam and orbital angular momentum related to spatial variations of the field .",
    "these variations derive from the helical structure of the wavefronts comprising the beam or , equivalently , from a phase singularity at the beam axis .",
    "the topological charge characterizing the phase singularity and associated orbital angular momentum gives rise to distinctive phenomena such as soliton generation  @xcite , entanglement of photon quantum states , orbital angular momentum exchange with atoms and molecules ( in addition to the collection of papers  @xcite , see reviews in ref .",

    "@xcite and use the @xmath1matrix approach in which the far - field matching method is combined with the results for nonparaxial propagation of lg beams  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to examine the near - field structure of electromagnetic field depending on the parameters characterizing both the beam and the scatterer .",
    "this structure has recently attracted considerable attention that was stimulated by an upsurge of interest to the so - called _ photonic nanojets _ and their applications ( for a review see ref .",
    "these nanojets were originally identified in finite - difference - time - domain simulations  @xcite as narrow , high - intensity electromagnetic beams that propagate into background medium from the shadow - side surface of a plane - wave illuminated dielectric microcylinder  @xcite or microsphere  @xcite of diameter",
    "greater than the illuminating wavelength . in other words ,",
