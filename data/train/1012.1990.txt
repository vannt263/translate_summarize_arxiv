    "narrow attractive interactions are ubiquitous in the realm of colloidal dispersions . a most relevant instance is represented by depletion - induced forces in mixtures of highly asymmetric hard spheres , a field that has received a fundamental contribution by bob evans  @xcite .",
    "although these investigations have shown that the structure of effective depletion interactions is in general more complex than just a single attractive tail , a narrow attractive contribution at short distance is still to be expected in most cases , and its relevance to the modelization of both the equilibrium and non equilibrium phase behavior of colloidal systems has long been acknowledged .    in view of this , it is somewhat disappointing that the difficulties experienced by most liquid - state theories when phase separation occurs , the foremost of which is lack of convergence in a ( not necessarily small ) neighborhood of the critical region , only become worse when the range of the attractive potential decreases to a small fraction of the particle size .",
    "however , it may be argued that this is not a fundamental difficulty , inasmuch as this class of interactions can be dealt with by the sticky hard - sphere ( shs ) model  @xcite .",
    "this is obtained from the prototypical attractive interaction , i.e. , the hard - core plus square - well ( sw ) potential @xmath4 given by @xmath5 by taking the limits @xmath1 , @xmath6 so that the second virial coefficient @xmath7 stays finite and non vanishing : @xmath8 &   \\sigma \\leq r \\leq ( 1+\\delta)\\sigma \\mbox{\\hspace{1 cm } } \\delta\\to 0 \\ , , \\\\   0 & r>(1+\\delta)\\sigma \\ , .",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{shs}\\ ] ] the stickiness parameter @xmath9 is related to the second virial coefficient of the shs model @xmath10 by the relation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the second virial coefficient of the hard - sphere fluid . as shown by baxter  @xcite , this model be can solved exactly within the percus - yevick ( py ) integral equation  @xcite .",
    "because of the way the limit  ( [ shs ] ) is taken , the solution does not depend on the temperature , but rather on the stickiness @xmath9 or , equivalently , on @xmath10 . the connection between the shs model and an actual fluid at a certain temperature @xmath13 can be made by a generalized principle of corresponding states that , although not rigorous , has been found to work remarkably well . according to this principle ,",
    "usually referred to as noro - frenkel ( nf ) scaling  @xcite , a pair potential @xmath14 consisting of a hard - core repulsion with diameter @xmath15 and an attractive tail @xmath16 can be mapped into the sw potential  ( [ sw ] ) , provided that the width @xmath0 of the attractive well is determined so that its second virial coefficient @xmath17 will be the same as that of the original interaction at the same temperature @xmath13 , assuming that in both cases @xmath13 is measured in units of the well depth . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath0 is small , by following the same procedure the sw potential can in turn be mapped into the shs model . in this way , nf scaling",
    "can be combined with baxter analytical solution of the shs model to provide a unified description of fluids with narrow attractive interactions .",
    "for instance , the critical temperature @xmath18 of such a fluid can be evaluated by that at which its @xmath17 is equal to the critical value of @xmath10 .",
    "although the shs model has a perfectly regular solution within the py approximation and has also been the subject of intensive simulation studies  @xcite , the singularity embedded into its very definition should instigate a mild feeling of suspicion .",
    "in fact , twenty - three years after the appearance of the model , stell  @xcite discovered that the latter from a rigorous statistical mechanical point of view is thermodynamically unstable whenever the number of particles is greater than eleven . however , the state of affairs is less serious than it might seem : the instability arises from a number of rather fancy particle configurations , that are readily destroyed by the slightest amount of polidispersity in the system",
    ". therefore , the shs model and its approximate analytical solution via the py equation  @xcite still remain a valuable tool for the interpretation of the phase diagram of colloidal dispersions subject to short - range interactions .    there is , however , a significant limitation of this solution that negatively affects its predictive power , i.e. , its lack of thermodynamic consistency .",
    "this is particularly evident when the liquid - vapor transition of the model is considered : the coexistence curves determined by the compressibility and internal energy routes described in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] differ markedly from each other , the discrepancy between the critical densities amounting to nearly a factor three , and neither of them agrees quantitatively with the simulation results  @xcite . in this respect , it is also worth recalling that the py approximation upon which the analytical solution of the shs is based , is expected to become less and less accurate as the density is increased , while on the other hand the critical density increases as the range of the interaction decreases , and for @xmath1 the limiting value predicted by the simulations  @xcite is considerably larger than that expected for lennard - jones like fluids .    recently , a different approach has emerged , which is based upon enforcing consistency between the aforementioned energy and compressibility routes to the thermodynamics , namely , the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza )  @xcite .",
    "this has been applied especially to the case in which @xmath14 consists of a hard core and a yukawa ( hcy ) attractive tail : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the inverse - range parameter of the interaction . for the hcy potential ,",
    "the scoza has shown a remarkable robustness even for very short - range tails , while still remaining accurate  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one might argue that accuracy can not be expected to persist for attractions of arbitrarily short range , since after all , as recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , the scoza assumes that the direct correlation function @xmath21 of the fluid is linear in the attractive part @xmath16 of the interaction , and its low - density expansion does not even give back the correct expression of @xmath17 .",
    "in  @xcite it was suggested that for narrow attractive interactions it could be more appropriate to have a @xmath21 which depends linearly not on @xmath16 , but rather on its mayer function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inverse temperature . if this prescription were adopted in the scoza , one would obtain a `` non - linear scoza '' bound to become exact at low density .",
    "now , the sw potential is quite special in this respect , because both @xmath16 and its mayer function are constant in the well region and vanish elsewhere , and therefore they have the same functional form as far as they dependence on @xmath24 is concerned , the only difference being their ( state - dependent ) amplitude . on the other hand , in the scoza this amplitude",
    "is determined by an _",
    "exact _ thermodynamic consistency condition . as a consequence , for the sw potential",
    "the usual scoza _ must _ coincide with its non - linear counterpart , and hence predict the exact @xmath17 at low density , unlike for a generic tail potential .",
    "it is then tempting to investigate how the scoza will behave for narrow sw potentials : will the quite special status of this potential enable it to recover a finite @xmath2 in the limit @xmath1 ?",
    "this possibility is quite enticing , because it would allow one to fix the lack of thermodynamic consistency that is the main defect of the py solution of the shs fluid  @xcite , possibly obtaining a better agreement with the simulation results for the phase diagram  @xcite .    with this in mind",
    ", we have performed a study of the scoza for narrow sw interactions .",
    "such a task requires a fully numerical solution of the scoza , because one can not take advantage of the wealth of analytical results available for the hcy potentials  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this problem was already tackled in  @xcite , where the numerical solution of the scoza for a generic tail interaction @xmath16 was worked out and applied to the sw potential .",
    "the investigation performed there showed that on narrowing the well , the results become more and more dependent on the choice of the upper boundary @xmath25 of the density interval where the scoza is solved , at which a high - density boundary condition needs to be specified . in order",
    "to get rid of such a dependence , one needs to move @xmath25 to higher and higher values , but eventually this is prevented by a lack of convergence of the numerical algorithm .",
    "on the basis of the conclusions of that work , we have then reconsidered the numerical solution of the scoza paying special attention to the problem of obtaining convergence at high density , and developed a numerical algorithm that remains convergent up to @xmath26 , which is near the density at close packing . by this , we have managed to obtain results for wells down to @xmath27 , which however is not small enough to represent reliably the behavior of the scoza in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "we have then resorted to a different strategy , namely , we have taken the sticky limit  ( [ shs ] ) of the sw potential from the outset , and imposed thermodynamic consistency on the top of this .",
    "again , the results turn out to be strongly dependent on the high - density boundary condition , but in this case the simpler form of the scoza equation allows one to circumvent this problem by resorting to a solution technique which requires only the behavior at low density to be specified . unfortunately , according to this solution the scoza fails to have a liquid - vapor transition in the sticky limit  ( [ shs ] ) .",
    "however disappointing , the full picture appears to be consistent enough to indicate that the scoza critical temperature will decrease too rapidly to give a finite value of @xmath2 for @xmath1 . on the other hand , the approximation which is introduced in the scoza , namely , that the contribution to the direct correlation function @xmath21 due to the tail interaction @xmath16 has the same range as @xmath16 itself , and therefore vanishes wherever @xmath16 does ; is made also in the py equation , which moreover is thermodynamically inconsistent .",
    "this suggests that using thermodynamic consistency as a way to improve the py solution for the shs potential  ( [ shs ] ) would require to give up the _ ansatz _ on the range of @xmath21 .",

    "we are interested in a simple model fluid of particles interacting via a two - body , spherically symmetric potential @xmath14 that consists of a hard core with diameter @xmath15 and an attractive tail @xmath16 : @xmath28 as is customary in integral - equation theories , the scoza is based on an approximate closure of the exact ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation that relates the two - body correlation function @xmath29 and the direct correlation function @xmath21 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number density of the fluid , @xmath32 being the volume , and @xmath33 the particle number .",

    "the waisman parametrization has been used .",

    "we observe that , irrespective of the specific discretization of the pde , a necessary step of the integration scheme consists in solving the oz equation  ( [ oz ] ) supplemented with the closure  ( [ closure ] ) .",
    "this amounts to solving the orpa for an effective inverse temperature @xmath48 . in several previous applications of the scoza ,",
    "@xmath16 was chosen as a yukawa tail  @xcite , a linear combination of yukawa tails  @xcite , or other similar forms such as the sogami - ese  @xcite or related potentials  @xcite .",

    "( [ oz ] ) , ( [ closure ] ) .",
    "although the integration of the pde must always be carried out numerically , this leads nevertheless to a considerable simplification of the whole procedure .",

    "moreover , as already found in  @xcite and recalled in the introduction , for short - range wells the solution of the pde is very sensitive to the position of the upper boundary @xmath25 of the density interval , unless this is moved to very high values .",

    "( [ scozasticky ] ) when the high - density boundary @xmath240 is pushed to ( unphysically ) high values , but is clearly at odds not only with the py solution of the shs model  @xcite , but also with the simulation results  @xcite .",
    "the present investigation supports the conclusion that in the limit of vanishing well width @xmath1 , the scoza critical temperature decreases too rapidly to give a finite value of @xmath2 , so that @xmath17 or , equivalently , the stickiness @xmath9 , do not represent a convenient way to measure the temperature in this limit .",
    "imposing thermodynamic consistency on the shs model does not lead to a better quantitative agreement with simulation compared to the highly inconsistent py solution , but merely makes the liquid - vapor transition disappear .",
    "we have performed an investigation of the scoza for sw potentials , focused on the regime of narrow wells which is the most relevant for the modelization of colloidal particles .",
    "this study was prompted by the lack of a theory able to account quantitatively for the liquid - vapor phase transition in a system of sticky hard spheres : in the well known and widespreadily used py approximation  @xcite , the various routes to the thermodynamics of the fluid are inconsistent with one another , and agree only qualitatively with the results of computer simulation  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for hcy potentials the scoza can be solved semi - analytically , and has already been usefully applied to narrow - range tails  @xcite .",
    "the rationale for turning to the sw potential within the scoza is that this interaction has the unique feature of having the scoza become exact at low density , thereby recovering the correct @xmath17 which plays such an important role for narrow interactions .",
    "however , the results presented here show that this peculiarity turns more into a liability than an asset . for wells of non vanishing width @xmath0 ,",
    "after extending the study already made in  @xcite to ( slightly ) smaller @xmath0 , we can not but confirm the conclusions of that work , namely : i ) the results are found to be very sensitive to the boundary condition at high density that is needed to integrate the scoza pde , actually much more so than in the case of hcy potentials of comparable range .",
    "such an undesired feature can be tamed by pushing the density of the boundary to very high values , but this has the effect of making the numerical solution of the pde unfeasible for @xmath267 .",
    "ii ) in the range of @xmath0 for which meaningful results can be extracted , the overall agreement with simulation data , at least for the phase diagram , is actually worse than what was found for the hcy potential  @xcite , although a sharp assessment of the performance of the scoza is made difficult by the considerable discrepancies between different simulations .",
    "if the sticky limit is taken from the outset , and subsequently thermodynamic consistency is imposed , the scoza pde is obtained explicitly in closed form , but the high - density boundary problem is again found to be looming . if the pde is turned into an infinite set of ordinary differential equations and the low - density behavior alone is imposed , the liquid - vapor phase boundary disappears altogether .",
    "this supports the conclusion that as the attractive potential range vanishes , the scoza critical temperature will decrease more rapidly than what is necessary to yield a finite @xmath2 .    stating that the scoza is inadequate for sw interactions in the sticky limit is merely an observation , and does not shed any light on the reason behind the fact . in this respect",
    ", one should recall the result of stell  @xcite mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , who showed that the shs model is strictly speaking ill - defined if a class of problematic configurations of particles is not ruled out , for instance by introducing a small amount of polidispersity into the system .",
    "can it be that the ( possibly more accurate ) scoza approach exposes the malicious effect of the diverging clusters , which are simply neglected in the py approximation ?",
    "we regard this as unlikely , since the two approximations are quite similar in their handling of the correlation functions of the fluid , giving the same functional form for @xmath21 in the sticky limit  @xcite .",
    "what we deem most probable , instead , is that the failure is a combined effect of the approximate closure  ( [ closure ] ) and the consistency requirement  ( [ consist ] ) .",
    "indeed , the closure is likely to miss a number of singular features , i.e. , discontinuities and dirac-@xmath0 peaks , that show up in the real correlation function  @xcite : the isothermal compressibility , being dependent on the volume integral of the same function , suffers from the same defect . on the contrary ,",
    "the internal energy of the fluid depends on the contact value of the cavity function alone : when thermodynamic consistency is imposed , the latter has to compensate for the missing contributions , unnaturally pushing away the liquid - vapor phase boundary .",
    "we stress that at the moment this is a mere , untested hypothesis .",
    "one may hope that the strong dependence of the results on the high - density boundary condition found for narrow sw potentials will become less drastic turning to a different form of the interaction .",
    "in fact , as observed above , for the hcy potential this unwelcome feature , albeit still there , is nevertheless much less pronounced .",
    "if this is actually the case , then the fully numerical solution of the scoza which has been developed here and the one previously developed in  @xcite , could still be usefully applied to different forms of short - range potentials , not to mention the instance of interactions that are not of short range  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this solution could be helpful in the context of the renormalization - group based hierarchical reference theory ( hrt )  @xcite , specifically for enforcing the core condition on @xmath129 exactly ( of course within the limit of numerical accuracy ) .",
    "in fact , in the smooth cut - off formulation of the hrt  @xcite , similarly to the scoza , this condition can be ( and has been ) implemented analytically for a hcy potential , but for a generic tail potential a numerical solution would again be needed . also , this is always the case for the sharp - cut off hrt , irrespective of the form of the tail potential . in the latter theory , the core condition",
    "was implemented by introducing a number of approximations  @xcite , which however affect the accuracy of this approach for short - range interactions  @xcite . a better procedure such as that developed here would certainly be more adequate .    as for the sticky limit",
    ", the results presented in this work suggest that , if thermodynamic consistency is to be employed as a way to improve upon the accuracy of the py solution for the shs potential  ( [ shs ] ) , one should first get rid of the approximation common to the scoza and the py equation : namely , that the contribution to the direct correlation function @xmath21 due to the tail interaction @xmath16 has the same range as @xmath16 itself , and therefore vanishes wherever @xmath16 does . in this respect",
    ", it is worthwhile recalling that the same approximation is used in conjunction with thermodynamic consistency not only in the scoza , but also in the hrt  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the combination of these ingredients is bound to become dangerous for vanishing attraction range , it is likely that this would affect the hrt as well , and that both the scoza and the hrt would benefit from a solution to this problem .",
    "we would like to dedicate this paper to bob evans on his @xmath268 birthday .",
