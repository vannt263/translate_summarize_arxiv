    "the distribution of the cavity is assumed to be spherically symmetric .",

    "the lack of a shock indicates that the expansion of the lobe is not very supersonic , on the other the lobe is not strongly deformed by the buoyancy force and hence the expansion is also not very subsonic .",
    "therefore , a somewhat uncertain but reasonable assumption is that the radio lobes propagate with the sound speed , which , in a @xmath41 kev plasma , is @xmath64 by adopting @xmath65 and @xmath66 . assuming that the lobes are in the plane of the sky , the center of the cavity is approximately @xmath67 kpc ( @xmath68 ) from 3c 40b , hence the cavity age is @xmath69 years .",

    "the observed sharp surface brightness edges in ngc545 and ngc541 , and the temperature difference between the regions inside and outside the edges suggest that these features are contact discontinuities or cold fronts @xcite .",

    "ideally , their velocities can be directly calculated from x - ray observations using the ratio of the thermal pressures at the stagnation point ( @xmath93 ) and in the free stream ( @xmath94 ) @xcite . however , due to the relatively low number of counts a number of assumptions are involved , and hence only crude estimates can be given . on the one hand @xmath93 can not be constrained across the surface brightness edges , instead we used the average pressure in the galaxy ; on the other outside the cold fronts @xmath94 can only be measured in a relatively large region .",

    "we thus conclude that the detection of hot icm between the bright cluster galaxies is consistent with the picture of the galaxy dynamics in abell 194 .",

    ", we find that lmxbs and cxb sources altogether can be responsible for @xmath133 sources , whereas the observed number is @xmath134 , implying a @xmath135 excess of point sources .",
    "we mention that @xcite reported an excess of sources in abell 194 ( and abell 1060 ) in the luminosity range of @xmath136 over the full _ xmm - newton _ fov .",
    "they suggested that these sources , many identified with cluster member galaxies , are agn within cluster - member galaxies .",
    "the source excess we report has a very different origin since these sources appear to be associated with the massive early - type galaxies in abell 194 , and are fainter , typically @xmath137 , than those studied by @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the lmxb luminosity function exhibits a scatter of about a factor of two ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although such variations can not explain the total number of excess sources , it may be responsible in part .",
    "the stable shape of the luminosity function implies that if its bright end normalization is higher , then its faint end must also have an elevated level .",
    "thus , we can scale the average luminosity function using the @xmath138 kev band flux from the unresolved emission in regions @xmath112 and @xmath113 . the derived total hard band unresolved x - ray luminosity of @xmath139 corresponds to @xmath140 . below the @xmath141 sensitivity limit , the average lmxb luminosity function @xcite predicts @xmath142 in the @xmath138 kev energy band , assuming an average power law lmxb spectrum with slope of @xmath18 and galactic column density @xcite .",
    "thus , the luminosity function of lmxbs has to be scaled up by @xmath143 .",
    "therefore the total predicted number of lmxbs is @xmath6 in regions @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "taking this as the expectation value , the total number of predicted lmxbs and cxbs is @xmath144 , whereas @xmath134 sources are observed .",
    "an additional major uncertainty in the average lmxb luminosity function is the relatively low number of bright ( @xmath145 ) sources in the sample of @xcite .",
    "this implies large systematic uncertainties at the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "indeed , according to @xcite the number of birght lmxbs above @xmath146 may be factor of @xmath147 times higher within @xmath58 confidence interval due to systematic errors .",
    "taking this uncertainty into account , it is feasible that significantly more , altogether @xmath148 , resolved sources are bright lmxbs in regions @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    ". therefore lmxbs and cxb sources may account for up to @xmath115 sources of the @xmath134 detected .    since no significant star - formation is associated with early - type galaxies ,",
    "it is implausible that the additional population of point sources are high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) . to illustrate this point we estimate the star - formation rate ( sfr ) required to produce 9 hmxbs brigher than @xmath149 .",
    "relying on the average hmxb luminosity function from @xcite and using the normalization by @xcite the required sfr is @xmath150 .",
    "as this value is consistent with those observed for starburst galaxies , we conclude that the importance of hmxbs is negligible .",
    "since the galaxies we consider are in a cluster , it is possible that ( at least some of ) the x - ray sources are associated with galaxies within the cluster , alternatively foreground stars may play a role . to identify such galaxies we cross - checked the coordinates of all x - ray sources in ned .",
    "additionally we visually inspected hubble space telescope and dss images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : point_sources ] right panel ) to search for optical counterparts of x - ray sources .",
    "we found only one x - ray source around ngc 541 ( ra : 01h25m46.66s ; dec : -01d22m12.97s ) which has an optical counterpart . excluding this source the observed number of x - ray sources is @xmath151 , whereas lmxbs and cxb sources may account for up to @xmath115 sources .    as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : point_sources ] , ngc547 , ngc545 , and ngc541 have very luminous x - ray coronae extending to large radii , within which a notable fraction of the detected sources are located .",
    "as our experience shows , it is feasible that some ( unknown ) fraction of the resolved sources are not pointlike compact sources , but are features of the shock - heated gas distribution .",
    "obviously , such features in the gas distribution would further decrease the discrepancy between the observed and predicted number of resolved pointlike sources .",
    "however , taking the depth of the _ chandra _ observations and the distance of abell 194 , with the currently available exposures this question can not be resolved .",
    "we conclude that in regions @xmath112 and @xmath113 a @xmath152 excess of point sources is detected , which may ( partly ) be due to unresolved features of the shocked x - ray gas and/or an excess population of bright sources .",
    "minkowski s object ( mo ) @xcite lies along the jet emanating from ngc541 ( 3c 40a ) , and is believed to be a classic example of jet - triggered star - formation in the local universe .",
    "mo was studied by @xcite and @xcite , who suggested that the observed emission originated in a starburst .",
    "more recently a multi - wavelength study by @xcite found that the stellar population of mo is dominated by a @xmath153 years old , @xmath154 instantaneous burst , with a current sfr of @xmath155 .    in actively star - forming galaxies the dominant fraction of the observed x - ray emission",
    "is a combination of the population of hmxbs and the diffuse hot ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , due to the relatively high source detection sensitivity ( @xmath156 ) in mo , most of the hmxbs are not resolved .",
    "indeed , in a circular region with @xmath55 radius around mo we detected only one x - ray source with 8 counts ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "thus , in mo the various x - ray emitting components can not be separated from each other since they all contribute to the unresolved emission .",
    "therefore we can only place upper limits on the observed x - ray emission by assuming that it originates either from unresolved hmxbs or from hot ism .",
    "first , we assume that the total x - ray luminosity is due to the population of unresolved hmxbs .",
    "the observed source counts from the selected @xmath55 circular region in the @xmath114 kev band correspond to a luminosity of @xmath158 assuming a typical hmxb power law spectrum with slope of @xmath159 and galactic column density . converting this luminosity into the @xmath124 kev band , and taking into account the sfr in mo @xcite",
    ", we obtained @xmath160sfr@xmath161 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with that observed for hmxbs @xcite , thereby suggesting that at least part of the observed x - ray emission originates from the population of hmxbs .",
    "second , we assume that the observed x - ray emission is due to hot ism .",
    "since the observed number of counts is not enough to perform a spectral fit , we adopt a gas temperature of @xmath162 kev and @xmath163 solar abundance . applying this conversion",
    "the observed counts correspond to a luminosity of @xmath164 . assuming a spherically symmetric gas distribution within the selected @xmath55 circular region , the estimated average gas density is @xmath165 and the total gas mass in mo is @xmath166 .",
    "note that the upper limit on the gas mass is @xmath147 times higher than the stellar mass in mo @xcite .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that the hot ism dominates the observed x - ray emission .",
    "additionally , if the x - ray emission in mo is dominated by hot ism , the associated thermal energy is on the order of a few times @xmath167 , the exact value depending on the gas temperature . to inject this large an amount of energy into the hot ism ,",
    "a few times @xmath168 type ia supernova ( sn ia ) explosions are required . on a timescale of @xmath153 years",
    ", this implies a sn ia rate of few times @xmath169 , being @xmath170 orders of magnitude higher than the predicted sn ia rate in mo based on its sfr @xcite . therefore sne ia can not heat @xmath166 gas to x - ray temperatures , but only a small fraction of it .",
    "thus , we conclude , that the x - ray emission in mo is either dominated by hmxbs or the jet interaction with the ambient ism plays a role in heating the gas .",
    "although it is widely believed that the star - formation in mo is triggered by the jet emanating from ngc541 ( 3c 40a ) , based on our results on the dynamics of abell 194 we explore an alternate origin of mo . in sect .",
    "[ sec : merger ] we demonstrated that ngc541 is falling through the cluster and its direction of movement is pointing towards the west .",
    "interestingly , its motion approximately points back to ngc547/ngc545 and also crosses the position of mo .",
    "this suggests that the active star - formation in mo could be triggered by its interaction with ngc541 .",
    "the projected distance of mo from ngc541 is @xmath171 kpc , and the velocity of ngc541 is @xmath172 ( sect .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] ) . assuming that the motion takes place in the plane of the sky , and considering only the velocity of ngc541",
    ", the interaction between ngc541 and mo could have happened @xmath173 years ago .",
    "the age of mo can be estimated by different methods : on the one hand @xcite obtained a stellar age of @xmath153 years based on spectral energy distribution models ; on the other if constant sfr ( @xmath155 ) is assumed and the total stellar mass of mo ( @xmath154 ) is considered , an average age of @xmath174 years is computed .",
    "thus , the estimated age of mo is @xmath175 years , which is in approximate agreement with the time range of the possible interaction between mo and ngc541 .",
    "thus , it is feasible that the interaction between a preexisting gas - rich dwarf galaxy ( now observed as mo ) and ngc541 triggered a starburst event , which largely rejuvenated the stellar population of mo .",
    "we investigated the poor cluster , abell 194 , based on _ chandra _ and _ rosat _ observations .",
    "the main results of our work are outlined below .",
    "+ ( i ) we demonstrated the existence of an x - ray cavity at the southern part of abell 194 formed by the southern radio lobe arising from 3c 40b . using the parameters of the hot icm , the extent and location of the cavity , we estimated the total work of the agn , @xmath2 , the age of the cavity , @xmath1 years , and the total cavity power , @xmath3 .",
    "\\(ii ) we detected sharp surface brightness edges , identified as merger cold fronts , and extended tails in the _ chandra _ images of ngc545 and ngc541 .",
    "we estimated that ngc545 and ngc541 are moving with transonic velocities , and their motion is oriented approximately in the plane of the sky .",
    "based on these and earlier observations , we concluded that ngc547 , associated with 3c 40b , lies at the center of abell 194 and ngc545 and ngc541 are falling through the cluster .",
    "\\(iii ) a @xmath152 excess of point sources were detected around the massive early - type galaxies in abell 194 .",
    "the additional sources may be ( partly ) due to unresolved features of the shocked x - ray gas in the coronae of the galaxies and/or an excess population of bright sources .",
    "\\(iv ) we also investigated the x - ray emission from minkowski s object , and concluded that it is most likely dominated by the population of hmxbs rather than by hot diffuse ism .",
    "additionally , in the view of the galaxy dynamics in abell 194 , we explored the possibility that the starburst in minkowski s object was triggered by the interaction of a preexisting gas - rich dwarf galaxy and ngc541 .",
