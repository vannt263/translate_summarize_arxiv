    "turbulent thermal convection plays very important role in a range of phenomena in astrophysical and geophysical systems , where the underlying surfaces over which convective turbulence occurs are always rough . as an idealised model for the study of turbulent thermal convection in general , turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) , where a fluid layer confined between two horizontally parallel plates heated from below and cooled from above , has been studied extensively in the past two decades ( for reviews , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in terms of equations of motion",
    ", there are two control parameters in rbc , i.e. the rayleigh number @xmath8 and the prandtl number @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the applied temperature difference across a fluid layer of height @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the gravitational acceleration constant and @xmath5 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the thermal expansion coefficient , the thermal diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity of the working fluid .",
    "any laboratory convection experiments are confined , thus the aspect ratio @xmath15 and the container shape come into the problem .",
    "one of the central issues in the study of turbulent rbc is to determine how the response parameters , i.e. the nusselt number @xmath4 and the reynolds number @xmath6 , depend on the control parameters , where @xmath4 is a measurement of the system s heat transport efficiency and @xmath6 quantifies the turbulence intensity .",
    "the functional forms of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are usually expressed in terms of power laws : @xmath18 a comprehensive review on this issue can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that there are multiple scalings in the @xmath19 phase space where the bulk flow is in a turbulent state according to the grossmann and lohse model for turbulent thermal convection @xcite .    besides its fundamental importance in geophysical and astrophysical problems , turbulent thermal convection over rough surfaces is found to be a more effective way to transport heat , which is also useful in practical applications .",
    "heat transport enhancement is observed when the top and bottom plates are rough and the thermal boundary layer ( bl ) is thinner than the roughness height @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is later found to be due to more thermal plumes being emitted from the tip of the roughness elements @xcite .",
    "although the heat transport is enhanced , the scaling relation between @xmath4 and @xmath7 is found to be insensitive to the plate morphology @xcite .",
    "several later experiments show that the scaling exponents also change in convection cells with rough plates ( rough cells hereafter ) when compared with observations in convection cells with smooth plates ( smooth cells hereafter ) . using glass spheres adhered to the bottom plate of the convection cell ,",
    "the scaling exponent is found to depend on the distribution of the roughness height @xcite . for @xmath20 , a scaling exponent of @xmath21",
    "is reported when grooved roughness is distributed on both the plates and sidewall of the convection cell @xcite .",
    "a change of the scaling exponent from 0.28 in a smooth cell to 0.35 in a rough cell is observed @xcite .",
    "the rough cell used in the experiments of @xcite had similar design with the ones used in @xcite and @xcite.these authors have suggested that the discrepancy between their experiments and those of @xcite and @xcite may be attributed to the different constructions and materials of the rough plates . in the earlier experiments ,",
    "rough plates made of brass were attached on the surfaces the top and bottom smooth plates . while in the later experiment , the roughness elements were directly machined on a piece of copper .",
    "in addition to studying the global transport properties of the convection cell , the heat transport properties of individual plates with rough / smooth surfaces were also investigated @xcite .",
    "it is found that heat transport property of individual plate differs significantly and depends on the nature of the opposite plate of the same convection cell and the pertaining temperature boundary conditions . by determining the @xmath4 separately for the bottom rough plate and the top smooth plate , a scaling exponent of 1/2 for the rough plate and of 1/3 for the smooth plate",
    "are reported @xcite .",
    "the effects of roughness elements on the local dynamics of turbulent rbc are also studied . using flow visualization and near - wall temperature measurements",
    ", it is shown that the interaction of the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) and the secondary flow in the grooved region of the rough plate enhances plume emission which leads to the enhancement of heat transport @xcite .",
    "the study of local temperature fluctuations suggest that the enhancement of heat transport is determined by the dynamics in the near plate region @xcite .",
    "the effects of rough plates on the velocity bl have been investigated very recently @xcite , where it is found that the flow field is very different before and after the heat transport enhancement transition .",
    "direct numerical simulations ( dnss ) of turbulent rbc in rough cells also show that the scaling exponent increases @xcite .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath5 increases to 0.37 in a rough cell with grooved walls at the top and bottom plates when compared with the smooth cell @xcite .",
    "the scaling exponent was also found to depend on the geometry of the roughness elements or  obstacles \" in a quasi-2-d dns @xcite .",
    "but the number of roughness elements in this study is very limited ( only 4  obstacles \" are used ) . in a 2-d study ,",
    "using sinusoidal rough elements , the scaling exponent @xmath5 is also found to depend on the wavelength of the roughness elements @xcite . in a dns study of turbulent taylor - couette flow the scaling exponent",
    "is also found to increase with wall - roughness @xcite .",
    "these numerical studies imply the importance of roughness geometry on turbulent transport",
    ". however , the limited number of roughness element in a 3-d or a ( quasi- ) 2-d computation domain makes the comparison between the dns studies and experimental ones less straightforward .",
    "although there are quite a number of previous experiments studying the effect of roughness on turbulent rbc , to the best of our knowledge no experimental study has been made to systematically varying roughness geometry .",
    "this motivates the present study in which the effects of roughness geometry on turbulent rbc have been investigated by systematically varying the roughness geometry . a parameter @xmath0 which is defined as the height of a single roughness element over its base width",
    "is used to characterise the geometry of roughness elements .",
    "in addition to heat transport enhancement as found by previous studies , we find that the heat transport scaling in a rough cell with fixed roughness height @xmath22 may be classified into three regimes .",
    "the experiments further show that @xmath0 can be used as a tuning parameter to manipulate heat transport scaling in rough cells in the heat transport enhanced regime .",
    "the reynolds number and local temperature fluctuation scalings with @xmath7 also change with @xmath0 , suggesting that the geometry of roughness elements not only alters the global heat transport of the system but also influences the bulk turbulence and the dynamics of the lsc .",

    "thus the aspect ratios @xmath25 of the convection cells were approximately unity .",
    "the top and bottom plates were made of 12 mm - thick copper except for the ones for rough cell with @xmath26 which were made of aluminium .",
    "the thermal conductivity of aluminium is 205 w/(m@xmath27c ) at temperature 25 @xmath27c , which is roughly half that of copper .",

    "the pyramid - shaped roughness elements were directly machined on the top and bottom plates that were then plated with nickel to prevent oxidation .",
    "the roughness elements were arranged in a square lattice form ( see figure [ fig_pic ] ) , which was the same as those used previously @xcite . by keeping the height of roughness elements @xmath22 a constant at 8 mm and changing the base width @xmath28 of individual roughness elements from 16 mm to 2 mm , rough plates with roughness parameter @xmath0 , defined as the ratio of @xmath22 and @xmath28 , at 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.9 and 4.0 were used in the experiments . with the increase of @xmath0 , the number density @xmath29 ( in unit of number of roughness element per @xmath30 ) also increases ,",

    "the present study implies that @xmath0 is a more suitable parameter to characterise the geometry of the roughness elements and the response of the system , rather than the number density of the roughness elements .",
    "the top plate was cooled by passing temperature - controlled water from a water bath ( poly science , 9702 ) through a chamber fitted on its top .",
    "the cooling water entered the chamber through two inlets and left the chamber through two outlets .",

    ", the convection cells were wrapped with styrofoam with a thickness of 6 cm .",
    "a temperature regulated copper basin was placed beneath the convection cell to prevent heat leakage from the bottom plate of the convection cell by maintaining the same temperature at the top and bottom of the basin .",

    "two kinds of working fluids , namely deionized water and flourinert fc770 ( fc770 hereafter , 3 m inc . ) were used .",

    "one possible reason leading to such a @xmath2-abnormality is that the lifetime of the thermal plumes at larger @xmath2 is larger compared to the small @xmath2 case . assuming that the thermal plumes have typical length scale comparable to the thermal bl thickness , the estimated thermal diffusion time scale , i.e. @xmath111 , for fc770 is 14.5 sec and that for water is 2.6 sec at @xmath112 .",
    "when normalised by the lsc turn - over time , the dimensionless plume lifetime for fc770 is 0.25 and that for water is 0.11 for @xmath71 .",
    "another likely reason is the stronger plume clustering effect in rough cells with larger @xmath0 as shown by the shadowgraph images in figure [ fig_shadow ] , which also has the effect of increasing plume lifetime or slowing the decay of plumes .",

    "in contrast , the @xmath230dependence of the plume width remains almost the same with a scaling exponent around 0.25 for @xmath0 smaller than 4.0 .",
    "it should be noted that the scaling exponent of plume width for @xmath71 increases considerably ( 0.341 ) when compared with other values of @xmath0 , which may be correlated with the drastically changed plume dynamics and morphology in rough cell with @xmath71 .",
    "as the thermal plumes are main heat carriers in turbulent rbc , the experiments suggest that the change of plume dynamics may lead to the change of the scaling law of heat transport for different values of @xmath0 .      when varying @xmath0 the number density @xmath29 of roughness elements also varies , i.e. @xmath231 .",
    "in fact , the two parameters have one - to - one correspondence provided that the ratio of the roughness element height @xmath22 to the cell height @xmath11 and @xmath15 are fixed , which is the case for the present study .",
    "to figure out whether @xmath0 is the most relevant parameter that characterises the system , we carried out another experiment , in which @xmath0 was kept constant at 4.0 and the height of the roughness elements was halved .",

    "the estimated viscous boundary layer thickness at the highest @xmath7 reached in the experiment is 4.8 mm .",
    "thus , the measurements at @xmath93 and @xmath78 mm are in regime ii . a scaling exponent @xmath5 = 0.60 is observed in rough cell with @xmath78 mm in regime ii , which is consistent with 0.59 observed in regime ii of rough cell with @xmath239 8 mm , which is indicated by the two parallel lines in figure [ fig_nu4 ] .",
    "the similar @xmath7-dependence of @xmath4 in regime ii in rough cells with @xmath22 = 4 mm and 8 mm can be seen more clearly from the compensated plot in figure [ fig_nu4](@xmath75 ) .",
    "these observations suggest that @xmath0 is not only a suitable parameter describing the geometry of the pyramid - shaped roughness elements , but also a suitable parameter to characterise the response of turbulent rbc over rough plates with different roughness geometries .",
    "a noticeable feature from figure [ fig_nu4](@xmath72 ) is that the measured @xmath4 in the rough cell with @xmath239 8 mm is larger than that in the rough cell with @xmath239 4 mm in regime ii despite the fact that they have similar @xmath7-dependence .",
    "this may be explained by the measured reynolds number based on the circulation time of the lsc as plotted in figure [ fig_re4 ] .",
    "it is seen that @xmath6 in the rough cell with @xmath240 mm is larger than that in the rough cell with @xmath2324 mm , which is true for both @xmath241 4.34 and @xmath52 23.34 .",

    "we varied @xmath0 from 0.5 to 4.0 by keeping the roughness height at a constant of 8 mm and changing the base width from 16 mm to 2 mm .",
    "in addition , a rough cell with @xmath2394 mm was used .",
    "the experiments covered rayleigh number @xmath243 and @xmath2 from 3.57 to 23.34 .    it is found that the heat transport is enhanced significantly by roughness elements , and the enhancement depends strongly on the roughness geometry .",

    "when this happens , the thermal plumes emitted from the tip of the roughness can be directly ejected into the bulk flow . an unexpected @xmath2 effect in turbulent rbc over rough plates",
    "was also observed : larger heat transport enhancement was observed for larger values of @xmath0 and larger @xmath2 .",
    "this may be correlated with the strong clustering of thermal plumes as clearly seen from the shadowgraph visualization of the flow field ( figure [ fig_shadow ] ) .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath6 is measured based on the turnover time of the large - scale circulation evaluated near the sidewall of the cells .",

    "a truly increased @xmath197 for @xmath71 was not for assertion .",
    "consistent with the observation in @xcite , it is found that @xmath6 is insensitive to the plate morphology for a fixed flux rayleigh number , i.e @xmath200 , but now with a wider range of @xmath2 and @xmath0 as compared with the experiment of @xcite .",

    "the experiments demonstrated that the heat transport behaviour in turbulent thermal convection can be manipulated using a roughness parameter @xmath0 that characterises the geometry of the roughness elements .",
    "it further showed that the flow dynamics and local temperature fluctuations are also altered by roughness geometry .",
    "there are several open questions : what is the effects of @xmath0 on the dynamics of the large - scale circulation , e.g. twisting / sloshing oscillation , flow cessation / reversal ?",
    "how will the vertical mean and variance temperature profiles change with @xmath0 ?",
    "finally , we remark that the 0.5 scaling exponent observed for @xmath0 = 4.0 in regime iii reminds one of the kraichnan ultimate regime of turbulent convection @xcite . whether regime iii for @xmath252 4.0 really corresponds to the kraichnan regime needs further investigations .",
    "the place to look would be the boundary layer , i.e. a truly turbulent boundary layer should be the ultimate test for the kraichnan regime .",
    "a very recent dns study suggests roughness may be used as a route to trigger the transition to the ultimate state of turbulent convection @xcite .",
