    "recent progress in laser technology has made it possible to produce isolated attosecond pulses @xcite , and with these electron dynamics can be followed on its natural time scale @xcite .",
    "one of the promising methods to follow sub - femtosecond dynamics in electronic systems is attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy ( atas ) , which offers an all - optical approach to light - matter interactions , with the high time resolution of the attosecond pulse and the high energy resolution characteristic of absorption spectroscopy . since 2010 , atas has proven itself as a very efficient tool in studying electron dynamics in atoms . by following the movement of electron distributions in a time integrated manner , atas experiments have been used to study a number of dynamical processes .",
    "examples hereof are the observation of valence electron motion in krypton ions @xcite , autoionization in argon @xcite , the observation of ac stark shifts of excited states in helium @xcite and krypton @xcite , and very recently observation and control of the dynamics in a two - electron wave packet of helium @xcite .",
    "common for these experiments is that a near - infrared ( nir ) or infrared ( ir ) pulse dresses the system , while the modification of the spectrum of a much shorter extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) attosecond pulse is measured .",
    "there is some ambiguity in the literature about which pulse should be refereed to as the pump ( probe ) pulse in the pump - probe setup of atas .",
    "we circumvent this problem by referring to the two pulses simply as the nir pulse and the xuv pulse. a variable delay between the xuv and nir pulses makes it possible to introduce an indirect time - resolution in time - integrated atas spectra , and in this way follow the evolution of the nir field - dressed system .",
    "theoretical investigations of atas have focused on explaining some of the typical features in the spectra such as autler - townes splittings of absorption lines @xcite , light - induced structures ( lis ) @xcite , and different interference phenomena @xcite .",
    "often simplified few - level models can capture the essential physics of a process and one can benefit from the fact that the moderate intensity of the xuv pulse places its interaction with the quantum system in the perturbative regime @xcite . finally an increasing number of direct calculations of the delay - dependent atas intensity spectrum has been carried out by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for a variety of systems .",
    "examples hereof are given in refs .",
    "@xcite where the atas intensity spectra were found by solving the tdse for helium . in the latter case the single - active - electron approximation was used .",
    "very recently atas experiments have been carried out on nitrogen @xcite and hydrogen @xcite molecules . neglecting the slow molecular rotations",
    ", the main difference between atoms and di - atomic molecules is that molecular systems vibrate in the internuclear separation . in view of the emerging experimental interest in atas of molecules",
    "it is important to characterize the main effects associated with the nuclear vibration .",
    "such a characterization is the aim of the present work .",
    "first we investigate one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath1 by solving the tdse exactly within the limitations of our two models : one where the nuclear distance is fixed and one where the nuclear degree of freedom is included .",
    "we note in passing that there is a long history in strong - field physics for using co - linear @xmath1 as a generic system to highlight molecular effects @xcite .",
    "the tdse calculations in @xmath1 show that the dissociative nature of the excited electronic states in the moving - nuclei model leads to major differences in the atas spectrum when compared to the fixed - nuclei case .",
    "the fixed - nuclei spectra are very similar to atomic spectra . in both cases",
    "the spectra are dominated by narrow , well - separated , absorption features centered around energies corresponding to bound states of the system . in moving - nuclei spectra , on the other hand , the absorption features are much broader and not necessarily well - separated . in the analysis of these broad moving - nuclei induced absorption lines we establish a method to determine the dissociation time of nuclear wave packets evolving on certain excited bo surfaces .",
    "this method does not depend on a pump - probe setup , and information about the dissociation time can be obtained from single - pulse experiments .",
    "we also find that the atas spectra obtained from tdse calculations can be reproduced accurately using an approach based on the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation and an expansion in a finite electronic basis .",
    "this approach is then used to calculate the atas spectrum of three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath2 including nuclear motion .",
    "compared to @xmath1 , h@xmath0 represent a case where the lowest excited electronic states are binding . in the atas spectrum of @xmath3",
    "we see a rich structure associated with population transfer to vibrational states of excited bo surfaces . in the spectrum of @xmath3",
    "we recognize some of the characteristics found in fixed nuclei @xmath1 and atomic spectra , however , other effects such as autler - townes splittings and lis at well - defined energies are absent in the moving nuclei spectrum .",
    "our analysis show that the suppression of such lis in moving nuclei systems are directly related to the molecular dynamics of the system , and that lis in molecules in general are extremely dependent on the population of the involved vibrational states and thereby on the bo curves of the involved electronic states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ results ] we present calculated atas spectra for our two models of @xmath1 , and discuss the atomic - like characteristics of the model with fixed nuclei .",
    "a three - level model description capturing some of the interference features is discussed in appendix  [ app ] . in the model of @xmath1 where the nuclei are allowed to move",
    ", we find that the absorption lines in the atas spectrum become very broad . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] we set up a model to explain these broad absorption lines , and use it to closer analyze the dissociation process of excited electronic states . in sec .",
    "[ h2 ] we present the atas spectrum for 3d @xmath2 for fixed and moving nuclei .",
    "the fixed nuclei spectrum is very similar to the atomic - like , fixed nuclei spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "however , as a result of population of vibrational states , corresponding to different excited electronic states , the moving nuclei atas spectrum of @xmath2 is very complex , and we will focus on the overall structure , interference phenomena in the absorption lines and lis . finally sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "atomic units ( @xmath4 ) are used throughout unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the description of a laser pulse propagating though a medium in principle requires a full quantum mechanical description of both the field and the medium . in this work , however , all pulses considered are far too intense to show any non - classical behavior , and the fields are therefore treated classically throughout . even in this semi - classical limit",
    "the full description of atas requires that we solve the tdse and maxwell s equations simultaneously , which is computationally very demanding @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is argued that the atas intensity spectrum of helium found using a single - atom response model , does not vary qualitatively from the spectrum found using a description including light propagation if the target density is not too high .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn from the work presented in ref .  @xcite . since our field parameters are very similar to the ones used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and our main focus is a qualitative description of characteristic molecular effects in atas , we expect the single - system response model to be sufficiently accurate for our purpose , and we will use it throughout the paper . to calculate how the xuv pulse is modified by propagation in atas experiments ,",
    "we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite .    from maxwell",
    "s equations we obtain the wave equation for the electromagnetic field @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath8 is the time - dependent polarization of the target defined as the dipole moment density in the target region .",
    "we consider fields linearly polarized along the @xmath9-direction , and propagating in the positive @xmath10-direction .",
    "we apply the single - system response model , thereby reducing the interaction between field and matter to a single point in space and for the @xmath9-components of @xmath5 and @xmath8 we obtain @xmath11 the polarization is given in terms of the @xmath9-component of the single - atom or single - molecule time - dependent dipole moment @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the density of atoms or molecules in the sample and @xmath14 is the expectation value of the dipole operator @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the solution of the tdse . the classical field in eq .",
    "is therefore linked to the quantum evolution of the system through @xmath17 .",
    "we now split the laser field in an incoming field and a field generated by the light - matter interaction .",
    "we assume that the incoming field propagates unchanged for all times @xmath18 all modifications of the total field are thus included in the generated field @xmath19 .",

    "we now consider the three terms of eq .  .",
    "the first term contains only information about the incoming field , and is therefore not of any interest , since we want to investigate the modification of the xuv pulse induced by the target .",
    "the two remaining terms contain information about this modification .",
    "however , since @xmath28 , the second term dominates over the third .",
    "henceforth we therefore refer to @xmath29 , \\label{response}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the atas spectrum . as seen from eq .",
    "absorption ( emission ) is described by negative ( positive ) values of @xmath30 . in eq .",
    "we have introduced the variable time delay @xmath31 between the nir and the xuv pulses in the incoming field .",
    "it should be noted that the atas spectrum of eq .",
    "is not the full intensity spectrum , but the modification of the intensity spectrum as compared to free propagation of the laser pulses .",
    "we refer to the full intensity spectrum of atas experiments , given by eq .",
    ", as the atas intensity spectrum .",
    "for the atas spectrum to give information about the modification of the xuv pulse , it is used that the frequency profile of the nir field is well - separated from the frequency profile of the xuv field .",
    "furthermore , the frequency profile of the higher - order harmonics of the nir field must also be well separated from the spectral range of the xuv pulse .",
    "we insure that this is the case by choosing nir pulses with moderate intensities such that only few - photon transitions are induced by these .    in closing this section",
    "we relate our expressions for the atas spectrum and intensity spectrum to other expressions used in the literature for similar quantities . in ref .",

    "apart from the sign convention , our approach to calculate the atas spectrum is therefore very similar to the approach of ref .",

    "it is accurate to expand eq .   to first - order in the argument of the exponential function , and we find that @xmath39 this means that both here , and in the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , the atas spectrum @xmath30 of eq .   is a good measure of the modification of the xuv intensity spectrum when the generated field is weak ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "because the relatively weak nir pulse leaves the system in its field - free ground state , it will not have any effect on the atas spectrum , when it arrives well before the xuv pulse .",

    "further , our calculations show that there is no significant difference in the nature of lis in systems with large and small detunings .",
    "the effect of nuclear motion in atas spectra has been elucidated .",
    "we performed calculations in 1d @xmath1 and 3d h@xmath0 with fixed nuclei , and found that the spectra of these systems are very similar to atomic spectra .",
    "moreover we investigated the same two systems including nuclear motion .",
    "for the systems with moving nuclei , we saw that the nature of the bo surfaces , corresponding to excited electronic states , were crucial .",
    "in @xmath1 all excited bo surfaces lead to dissociation , and as a result the atas spectrum shows very broad absorption features reflecting the damping of the time - dependent dipole moment by the dissociating nuclei . in the theoretical analysis of these broad absorption lines we found that , for specific field parameters , the width of the absorption lines were solely system dependent .",
    "the width of the lowest absorption line in the atas spectrum could therefore be linked directly to the time it takes for a nuclear wave packet to dissociate on the excited dissociative bo curve .",
    "temporal information about this process can be obtained using only one pulse , i.e. , without dressing of the system . in h@xmath0",
    "the broad absorption features of @xmath1 were replaced by rich structures in the atas spectrum .",
    "for h@xmath0 we focused on explaining the oscillations in the absorption lines , and found that these could be put into two different categories ; one category was oscillations on the timescale of half the ir period , the other category was oscillations on a much longer timescale .",
    "we argued that the oscillations on the timescale of half the ir period were very similar in nature to the oscillations seen in the absorption lines of the atomic - like @xmath1 with fixed nuclei .",
    "we therefore conclude that these oscillations are due to interference between populated states of the same symmetry . the oscillations on longer timescales , however , are a purely molecular signature associated with transfer of population between vibrational states .",
    "finally we found that the existence of lis at well - defined energies in molecular atas spectra depends critically on the number of populated vibrational dark states . as a result",
    "clear , unambiguous detection of lis can only be expected in systems where the bo curves of the ground state and the involved dark state(s ) are nearly parallel , or if one in another way can populate only a few vibrational dark states .",
    "this work was supported by the erc - stg ( project no .",
    "277767-tdmet ) , and the vkr center of excellence quscope .",
    "in this appendix we model the interference process between excited states of the same symmetry ( under @xmath87 ) resulting in a @xmath100 periodic modulation of the corresponding absorption lines in the atas spectrum .",
    "we focus on the interference fringes in the absorption line at @xmath288 ev in fig .  [",
    "fixed ] corresponding to an energy difference @xmath289 between the ground state and the fifth excited state . at large negative delays the population of the fifth excited state @xmath290 has two contributions for @xmath291 . a direct contribution from the xuv pulse alone , and an indirect contribution from the xuv and nir pulses acting in a combined manner . in the indirect process the xuv pulse populates the third excited state @xmath292 at time @xmath31 , and at a later time @xmath293",
    "the nir pulse excites population to the fifth excited state through the absorption of two photons . keeping only terms that contribute to a dipole signal with frequency @xmath289 we can write up the wave function of the system as @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the ground state with energy @xmath296 , @xmath297 are the energies of @xmath292 and @xmath290 , @xmath298 and @xmath299 are the amplitudes corresponding to the direct and the indirect absorption processes , and the phase @xmath300 is given by @xmath301 this phase is similar to the phase found in ref .",
    "@xcite where constructive interference conditions are investigated . to obtain eq .",
    "we used that the population of the ground state is almost constant in time due to the low intensity of the xuv pulse .",

    "the pulse parameters are as in fig .",

    "[ fringes ] we compare the atas spectra constructed from dipole signals found from the full tdse calculation [ eq .  ] and from eq .  ,",
    "respectively . following ref .",
    "@xcite we have chosen @xmath293 to be located a quarter of a nir period from the center of the nir pulse .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath298 and @xmath299 can be found using perturbation theory , but the choice @xmath303 suffices to illustrate the predictions of the model . as a result of the narrow spectral width of the nir pulse , interference of the type seen in eq . only occurs when the energy difference between two states of the same symmetry under @xmath87 is @xmath304 .",
    "consequently the associated oscillation periods are always @xmath93 with @xmath94 the period of a nir pulse cycle .",
    "we note that the interference phenomena of the type discussed here , always affect both absorption lines involved ( at @xmath305 and @xmath289 ) , and a similar pattern is found in the absorption line corresponding to the energy @xmath305 . for this absorption line , however , the phase of eq .",
