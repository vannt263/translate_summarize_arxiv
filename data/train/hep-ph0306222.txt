    "perturbation theory is a powerful tool for deriving the consequences of the standard model and its extensions in order to compare to experimental results . when strongly interacting particles are involved , perturbation theory becomes relevant when the experiment involves a short distance process , with a momentum scale @xmath1 that is large compared to 1 gev",
    ". then one can expand the theoretical quantities for the short distance part of the reaction in powers of @xmath2 , which is small for large @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the particles continue to interact at long distances , but for suitable types of experiments the long distance effects in the final state can be neglected while the long distance effects in the initial state can be factored into parton distribution functions that describe the distributions of partons in incoming hadrons .",
    "this works if the measurement of properties of the final state is _ infrared safe _ : the measurement is only weakly affected by long distance interactions in the final state .",
    "examples include the inclusive production of very heavy particles and the production of ( suitably defined ) jets of light particles",
    ".    the simplest sort of calculation for this purpose consists of calculating the hard process cross section at the lowest order in @xmath3 , call it @xmath4 , at which it occurs . for example , for two - jet production in hadron - hadron collisions , @xmath5 while for three - jet production in electron - positron annihilation @xmath6 .",
    "this kind of lowest order ( lo ) calculation is simple , but leaves out numerically significant contributions .",
    "corrections from higher order graphs are often found to be 50% of the lowest order result .",
    "for this reason , one often performs a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation , including terms proportional to @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "then the estimated error from yet higher order terms ( which are usually unknown ) is typically smaller , say 10% .",
    "there is another kind of calculational technique available , that of the monte carlo event generator @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "a computer program generates `` events , '' a list of particles ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ,  ) and their momenta @xmath11 that constitute a final state that could arise from the given collision .",
    "call the @xmath12th final state @xmath13 .",
    "the program is constructed in such a way that the probability of generating a final state @xmath14 is approximately proportional to the physical probability of getting this same final state in the standard model or in whatever theory is to be tested .",
    "that is , the predicted value for an observable described by a measurement function @xmath15 is @xmath16 alternatively , the program may generate weights @xmath17 for the events , so that @xmath18 the monte carlo event generators have proven to be of enormous value . among their benefits is the following .",
    "since they generate complete final states , one can use detector simulations to analyze the effects on the measurement of any departure of the detector from an ideal detector .",
    "essentially , this amounts to replacing an idealized measurement function @xmath15 by something that is much closer to what an actual detector does .",
    "there are , of course , some weaknesses in monte carlo event generators , considered as tools to provide predictions of the standard model and its extensions .",
    "one is that the theory encoded in them is more than the standard model .",
    "they also contain models and approximations for long and medium distance physics .",
    "fortunately , the long and medium distance effects do not matter much in the case that the measurement function @xmath15 is infrared safe and involves only one large momentum scale @xmath1 . in this case , the place where the medium and long distance approximations are important is in assessing the effects of detector imperfections , which likely result in having an effective measurement function , @xmath19 , including the detector effects , that departs somewhat from the ideal function @xmath15 and thus departs from being truly infrared safe .",
    "a more serious weakness of current monte carlo event generators is that they are based on leading order perturbation theory , so that a rather substantial theoretical uncertainty should be ascribed to the result if the result is considered as deduction from the standard model ( or one of its extensions ) with no other hypotheses included .",
    "return now to the nlo calculations .",
    "they are typically computer programs that act as monte carlo generators of partonic events .",
    "they produce events @xmath14 consisting of a few partons with specified momenta .",
    "for example , for three - jet production in electron - positron annihilation , there are three or four partons in the final state .",
    "each event comes with a weight @xmath17 .",
    "then the predicted value for an observable described by a measurement function @xmath15 is @xmath20 here @xmath21 is an idealized measurement function applied to the partonic final state .",
    "we see that the nlo programs are actually quite close in structure to the monte carlo event generators .",
    "one perceived weakness of the nlo monte carlo generators is that the weights are negative as well as positive .",
    "this feature arises because the programs do real quantum mechanics , in which an amplitude times a complex conjugate amplitude has a real part that can be either positive or negative .",
    "negative weights do not , however , cause a problem when inserted into eq .",
    "( [ average ] ) : computers can easily multiply negative numbers .",
    "the real weakness of most current nlo monte carlo generators is that they produce simulated final states that are not close to physical final states . what could be done to generate realistic final states ? following the example of the leading order event generators , which do generate realistic final states , one would use the final states in the nlo partonic generators to generate a parton shower from each outgoing parton .",
    "this gives a final state with lots of partons .",
    "then one could use one of the highly successful algorithms of the leading order monte carlo event generators to turn the many partons into hadrons .",
    "there should not be a serious problem with the hadronization stage , since this is modeled as a long distance process that leaves infrared safe observables largely unchanged .",
    "the problem lies with the parton showers . here",
    "a high energy parton splits into two daughter partons , which each split into two more partons .",
    "as this process continues , the virtualities of successive pairs of daughter partons gets smaller and smaller , representing splittings that happen at larger and larger distance scales .",
    "the late splittings leave infrared safe observables largely unchanged .",
    "however , the first splittings in a parton shower can involve large virtualities .",
    "they represent a mixture of long distance and short distance physics .",
    "thus one must be careful that the showering does not reproduce some piece of short distance physics that was already included in the nlo calculation .",
    "consider an example that illustrates these ideas , jet production in @xmath22 collisions with @xmath23 at the large hadron collider now under construction .",
    "one can calculate the inclusive cross section @xmath24 to make two jets with a dijet mass @xmath25 .",
    "we may specify that the jets are defined with the @xmath26 algorithm @xcite , that we integrate over the rapidities of the two jets in the range @xmath27 , and that @xmath25 is in the range @xmath28 .",
    "there are computer programs currently available to perform this calculation at nlo @xcite .",
    "there are no large logarithms in the theory in this kinematic region .",
    "thus an nlo calculation should be reliable . if the experiment were to disagree with the theory beyond the experimental errors and the estimated errors from uncalculated nnlo contributions and from parton distributions , that would be a significant indication that some sort of physics not included in the standard model is at work .",
    "although the theoretical picture just outlined seems bright , the available programs do not produce realistic final states . to illustrate this , imagine computing a cross section that is sensitive to the final state .",
    "for example , one might use a standard nlo program to calculate the cross section @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mass of the jet with the larger rapidity .",
    "our result would _ not _ be sensible in the region @xmath31 .",
    "it would have a nonintegrable singularity at @xmath32 together with a term proportional to @xmath33 with an infinite negative coefficient .",
    "the integral over @xmath30 of this highly singular function would give back @xmath24 , but the differential distribution would be highly nonphysical . in contrast , the standard monte carlo event generators can generate sensible results simultaneously for both @xmath24 and @xmath34 .",
    "the only drawback is that the result for @xmath24 will be correct only to leading order in an expansion in powers of @xmath35 .",
    "the problem addressed in this paper ( using , however , an example from electron - positron annihilation ) is how to modify such an nlo calculation so as to take advantage of the parton shower technology built into monte carlo event generators .",
    "we wish to get quantities like @xmath34 approximately right while not losing the nlo accuracy of @xmath36 .",
    "some technical language is helpful here in order to make these ideas more precise . using the familiar concept of infrared safety ( defined precisely in sec .",
    "[ sec : nlo ] ) , one can describe the cross section @xmath24 as an infrared safe two - jet cross section .",
    "then the cross section @xmath29 for @xmath37 is an infrared safe three - jet cross section : it is infrared safe and is nonzero only when the number of final state particles is three or more . with this language ,",
    "what we wish to do is get two - jet cross sections right to nlo and at the same time get @xmath12-jet cross sections approximately right for @xmath38 .",
    "recall that the shower monte carlo programs work by using an approximate version of the perturbative theory at an infinite number of orders in perturbation theory , approximating the behavior of the feynman graphs near the singularities corresponding to collinear parton splitting or soft gluon emission .",
    "these singularities lead to large logarithms , two powers of @xmath39 for each additional power of @xmath3 .",
    "the programs approximately add up a series of @xmath40 factors times logarithmic factors .",
    "after this , there is a phase that models how partons turn into hadrons . in this paper",
    "we omit the hadronization phase and use our own code for the parton showering .",
    "our intention is that in the future only the stages of showering that directly connect to the hard scattering would be part of a program for nlo hard scattering with showers .",
    "the parts of the shower related to `` softer '' parton splittings , along with hadronization , would be performed by one of the standard monte carlo programs .",
    "we thus concentrate in this paper on the showering  hard - scattering interface and not on the showering itself .",
    "we can illustrate the same points for an nlo base calculation that has one more jet .",
    "an instructive example is the cross section discussed above , @xmath34 .",
    "here we do not integrate over @xmath30 and we insist that @xmath41 not be small .",
    "this is technically an infrared safe three - jet cross section , as discussed earlier . in a three or four parton system that appears in the calculation of this quantity at nlo , jet",
    "1 consists of two or three partons and has mass @xmath30 , while jet 2 consists of one or two partons .",
    "the nlo calculation ( using @xcite ) should be reliable but would not have sensible final states .",
    "thus if we let @xmath42 be the mass of whichever of the two measured jets has the _ smaller _ rapidity and tried to calculate @xmath43 , the result would not be even approximately correct for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "one would then like to have a method that could get quantities like @xmath43 approximately right while not loosing the nlo accuracy of @xmath34 .",
    "this discussion can serve to illustrate another point . note that a calculation of @xmath34 will have a problem if @xmath46 because the result will contain large logarithms , namely logs of @xmath47 .",
    "the large logarithms are associated with the partons getting close to a two - jet configuration .",
    "one could then view the event as arising from a two - jet event in which one of the jets splits into two nearly collinear jets or one hard jet and one soft jet .",
    "a two - jet calculation with showers would get the effects of these large logarithms approximately right .",
    "what one would then want is a method to merge the two - jet and three - jet calculations so that 1 ) a two - jet infrared safe observable is correctly calculated at order @xmath48 , i.e.  nlo , 2 ) a three - jet infrared safe observable with suitable cuts so that the contributing events are well away from the two - jet region is correctly calculated at order @xmath49 , i.e.  nlo for three - jets , and 3 ) a three - jet infrared safe observable with cuts that allow contributions from close to the two - jet region is correctly calculated at order @xmath49 with additional corrections proportional to @xmath50 times logs , with @xmath51 , that approximately account for the production of three jets by showering from a two - jet event .",
    "an investigation of this merging problem would certainly be desirable , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "this paper concerns @xmath52 . the goal is to see how to modify a nlo calculation by adding parton showers in such a way that when the generated events are used to calculate an infrared safe observable , the observable is calculated correctly at next - to - leading order . to do this",
    ", we build on our work in @xcite , which sets up the nlo calculation in the coulomb gauge .",
    "it is convenient to use a physical gauge for this purpose because it makes the analysis simpler . in this paper",
    "we explain the aspects of this problem that relate to the divergences that appear in perturbation theory when two massless partons become collinear .",
    "this part of the method is , we think , quite simple and easy to understand .",
    "the treatment of the divergences that appear when a gluon becomes soft is a bit more technical and will be given in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the algorithms that we propose apply to showers from final state massless partons .",
    "they are illustrated using the process @xmath53 in quantum chromodynamics and are embodied in computer code that performs calculations for this process @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss showers from initial state massless partons . while our research program ( starting with @xcite )",
    "was underway , frixione and webber succeeded in matching showers to a nlo calculation for a problem with massless partons in the initial state ( but no observed colored partons in the final state ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently , frixione , webber , and nason have extended this method to massive colored partons in the final state @xcite .",
    "the general approach of @xcite is quite similar to that of the present paper with respect to collinear singularities .",
    "the principle difference is that we generate the first splittings of partons from an order @xmath4 diagram using the functions given by the partonic self - energy diagrams in the coulomb gauge , while @xcite uses the splitting functions of the herwig monte carlo event generator .",
    "we discuss @xmath52 but not @xmath54 .",
    "of course , to calculate @xmath55 at order @xmath3 with parton showering added would be quite a lot simpler than the present calculation for @xmath52 at order @xmath56 .",
    "however , merging the two calculations would not be trivial and is not attempted here .",
    "we simply suppose that the present calculation is to be applied with a measurement function that gives zero for events that are close to the two - jet configuration ( for example , for thrust near one ) .",
    "there has been other recent work on this problem @xcite . that of collins @xcite is particularly instructive .",
    "this approach seeks both to put the parton showering calculation on a more rigorous basis and at the same time to match it to the hard scattering calculation , viewing the hard scattering as one end of a cascade of virtualities .",
    "our goal is more limited .",
    "we take it as proven by experience that parton showers work well to make reasonably realistic final states .",
    "our only concern is to make sure that when we add parton showers we do not lose the nlo accuracy of the result .",
    "we begin with a program that calculates an infrared safe observable in electron - positron annihilation at next - to - leading order .",
    "the program @xcite uses a physical gauge , specifically the coulomb gauge , and performs all of the integrals , including the virtual loop integrals , numerically @xcite .",
    "it is not really necessary to perform the virtual loop integrals numerically .",
    "it is a lot easier , but if one wanted to perform these integrals by hand ahead of time and insert the analytical results into the program , the calculation could still proceed .",
    "it is also not necessary to use a physical gauge .",
    "however , the use of a physical gauge makes the method conceptually simpler .",
    "in particular , collinear singularities are isolated in very simple feynman subdiagrams , the cut and uncut two - point functions .",
    "if one were to use the feynman gauge , the collinear singularities would be spread over many kinds of graphs and one would need another layer of analysis to organize them into a simple form .",
    "the coulomb gauge , in particular , is well suited for calculations of electron - positron annihilation , in which the physics is approximately rotationally invariant in the electron - positron c.m .",
    "the time - like axial gauge has this same good property , but is not well suited for our algorithm for a technical reason : it introduces singularities in the complex energy plane for loop integrals , which would make the evaluation of the energy integrals in our algorithm more complicated .    in order to present a method for adding showers to the nlo program , we need to review a little about how the nlo calculation works .",
    "we present the barest outline .",
    "details may be found in @xcite . in the nlo program ,",
    "the observable is expressed in the form @xmath57 here there is a sum over the number @xmath12 of final state partons . for a next - to - leading order calculation of a three - jet observable , @xmath12 runs from 3 to 4 .",

    "thus we would not recommend using the code discussed in this paper for a comparison to data this near to the two - jet limit .",
    "nevertheless , we can still test for the absence of an @xmath255 term in @xmath109 .",
    "looking at the graph , we see that , within the errors , there is no evidence for a nonzero @xmath255 term in @xmath109 .",

    "we have presented a method for adding parton showers to a next - to - leading order calculation in qcd .",
    "specifically , we treat the final state collinear singularities , using the example of @xmath256 .",
    "our intention is that a program like ours would be used in conjunction with a standard monte carlo event generator @xcite .",
    "the complete calculation would then act as an event generator ( with positive and negative weights for the events ) in which the final states consist of hadrons generated from parton showers . recall that we defined primary parton splittings to be those of the partons emerging from an order @xmath257 graph .",
    "there are also secondary splittings : the further splittings of the daughters from the primary splittings as well as the splittings of partons emerging from an order @xmath7 graph and of their daughters .",
    "it is the primary splittings that need to be matched to the nlo calculation .",
    "the secondary splittings affect an infrared safe observable only at order @xmath169 .",
    "thus the partonic events from our program after the primary splittings could be handed to a monte carlo event generator , which would perform the secondary splittings and the hadronization .",
    "alternatively , our program can perform the secondary splittings , leaving hadronization for the monte carlo event generators . for the purpose of implementing such a scheme ,",
    "it is significant that the weight functions do @xmath258 have singularities when two partons are collinear or one is soft .",
    "this is in contrast to pure nlo calculations , which depend on cancellations between different events when an infrared safe observable is calculated .",
    "the method presented here is incomplete in that we leave for a companion publication @xcite the treatment of the soft gluon singularities of qcd .",
    "the code described in this paper is available at @xcite .",
    "a treatment of soft gluon effects , to be described in @xcite , is included in the code .",
    "parton showers are included , but the requisite data structures and color flow information that would be necessary to provide an interface with the showering and hadronization models of standard event generator monte carlo programs are not yet available .    the authors are pleased to thank steve mrenna for advice on how to implement parton splitting in a finite amount of computer time .",
