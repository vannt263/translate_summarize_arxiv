    "it has been experimentally found that the tizr system is characterized by full solubility of its constituents . as in pure titanium and zirconium ,",
    "three phases ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) are observed in the tizr alloy @xcite .",
    "the structural @xmath10 transformations of the equiatomic alloy were extensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by the differential thermal analysis ( dta ) at temperatures up to @xmath11  k , and pressures up to @xmath12  gpa .",
    "it was found that the @xmath13 transition temperature , being equal to @xmath14  k at atmospheric pressure , decreases with pressure down to the triple equilibrium point of the @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 phases ( @xmath15  gpa , @xmath16  k ) . at pressures above the triple point",
    "the @xmath4 phase transforms immediately to the @xmath3 phase with a light positive slope of the equilibrium line .",
    "if a sample is cooled to room temperature at a pressure of @xmath17  gpa , and then unloaded , one can obtain at atmospheric pressure a metastable @xmath3 phase which on heating transforms into an @xmath2 phase in the temperature interval from @xmath18  k to @xmath19  k. cooling of the @xmath4 phase in the pressure range @xmath20 - @xmath21  gpa results in the formation of a two - phase mixture of a stable @xmath2 and a metastable @xmath3 phase .",
    "the structural @xmath22 transformations in the tizr alloy were studied in detail in ref .",
    "investigating tizr samples under shear - strain conditions at pressures up to @xmath23  gpa at temperatures @xmath24 and @xmath25  k , the authors arrived at the conclusion that in equiatomic tizr the equilibrium @xmath22 boundary is situated on the p - t diagram at @xmath26  gpa . in the same paper",
    "the phase diagram of tizr was constructed in the regular - solution approximation , and the triple point parameters were calculated ( @xmath27  gpa , @xmath28  k ) . as may be seen , these values differ substantially from those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "detailed studies performed in ref . @xcite",
    "have shown that in the region of high pressures and temperatures there exist two @xmath3 phases ( @xmath3 and @xmath29 ) that differ in atomic volume by about @xmath30% .",
    "the authors suggested the existence of a isostructural phase transition @xmath31 connected with changes in the electron structure of the alloy .",
    "they supposed that the large difference in the atomic volume between the two phases points to the existence of an s - d electronic transition in @xmath9tizr .",
    "later , phase separation of a hexagonal tizr @xmath3 phase was experimentally detected in ref .",
    "the @xmath32 decomposition was revealed after a prolonged heat treatment at @xmath33  gpa and @xmath34  c. it was supposed that in a wide concentration range at pressures above the triple equilibrium point , the @xmath3 phase may exist in the @xmath35 alloy only as a metastable one that persists due to low diffusive mobility of its constituents .",
    "the decomposition of the @xmath9tizr solid solution into two @xmath3 phases of different structure was used as an alternative explanation for the experimental results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    up to now",
    "the electron structure and structural transformations of the equiatomic alloy tizr have never been calculated .",
    "below we present the results of our theoretical calculations of electronic , structural and thermodynamic properties of the equiatomic alloy tizr performed within the framework of the electron density functional theory and the debye - grneisen model .",
    "the tendency of the ordered equiatomic alloy @xmath9tizr to decompose is also investigated .",
    "the electron structure and total energy were calculated by the scalar relativistic full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( fplapw ) method , using the wien2k package @xcite . to ensure the desired accuracy of the total energy calculation , the number of plane waves was defined by the condition @xmath36 , the total number of @xmath37-points in the brillouin zone was equal to 3000 , 3000 , 600 for the @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 phase , respectively .",
    "the total and partial densities of states were obtained by a modified tetrahedron method @xcite .",
    "the atomic radii were the same for all phases and pressures : @xmath38  a.u .",
    "for zr , and @xmath39  a.u . for ti . in fig.[fig",
    ": tizr_cristal_structure ] are shown the crystal structures of the @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 phases of the equiatomic alloy tizr used in the calculation .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath4 phase was represented by a structure of the cscl type with ti atoms at the cube sites and a zr atom at the center .",
    "the @xmath2 phase had a hexagonal close - packed lattice in which one atom was zr , the other ti . finally , to describe the @xmath3 phase we used a hexagonal lattice with 6 atoms per cell ( an @xmath3 structure doubled along the @xmath40 axis ) .",
    "the atomic arrangement and species in this case were chosen as follows : @xmath41 - zr , @xmath42 - ti , @xmath43 - zr , @xmath44 - ti , @xmath45 - zr , @xmath46 - ti .",
    "thus , the @xmath4 and @xmath2 phases were represented by layers of ti and zr alternating along the @xmath40 axis , and in the @xmath3 phase layers of ti and zr were separated by a mixed ti - zr layer .",
    "= 0.9 in = 0.9 in = 0.9 in = 0.9 in = 0.9 in = 0.9 in    in the hexagonal structures the ratio @xmath1 was optimized for the experimental volume values . in the following ,",
    "when calculating the volume dependence of the total energy , the @xmath1 ratio was considered to be constant . in table [ table : tiz_lattice_parameter ] are listed the calculated and experimental equilibrium values of the tizr lattice parameters .",
    ".equilibrium values of the tizr lattice parameters in atomic units [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : tiz_lattice_parameter ]    it is seen from the table that the lattice parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 obtained in our calculation agree well with the experimental data .",
    "the greatest discrepancy is observed for the lattice constant of the @xmath3 phase .",
    "it should be noted that in ref .",
    "@xcite the lattice parameters were calculated for a metastable @xmath3 structure at atmospheric pressure , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for pressure - strained samples .",
    "the total energy of each structure was calculated for 7 values of the cell volume @xmath47 .",
    "the data obtained were then interpolated using the technique proposed by moruzzi @xcite . such an interpolation scheme ,",
    "together with the debye - grneisen model , makes it possible to include implicitly anharmonic effects .",
    "the curves obtained for the volume dependence of the electron subsystem total energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tizr_total_energy ] .",
    "the energy zero in figure corresponds to -8906.0 ry .",
    "as seen from the figure , the energy minimum in the ground state falls on the @xmath3 phase .",
    "and only at the relative volume change @xmath48 the @xmath4 phase becomes energetically preferable .",
    "a similar situation was observed in pure ti and zr as well .",
    "however the difference in energy between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases in tizr amounts to @xmath49  mry , while in pure ti and zr it is @xmath50  mry and @xmath51 mry , respectively .",
    "hence it follows that in the equiatomic alloy tizr the stability region of the @xmath3 phase should be much larger in temperature than in pure metals ti , zr .",
    "the equilibrium values of the volume are @xmath52 @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath53 , and @xmath55 @xmath53 for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 phases , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : tizr_free ] presents the volume dependence of the free energy at different temperatures .",
    "the free energy of the tizr alloy was calculated in the debye - grneisen model with allowance made for the contributions from the electron entropy .",
    "the technique of calculating this latter has been described in detail in ref . @xcite .",
    "as seen from the figure , the relationship between the energies of different structures changes with temperature .",
    "so , at @xmath24  k and zero pressure the energy minimum falls , as in the ground state , on the @xmath3 phase which remains energetically preferable up to @xmath5  k. in the temperature range @xmath6  k <",
    "t<@xmath8  k it is the @xmath2 phase of tizr alloy which becomes stable , while above @xmath8  k it is the @xmath4 phase .",
    "the phase diagram of tizr based on the analysis of gibbs potentials for different structures is presented in fig.[fig : tizr_phase ] .",
    "the results of calculation are shown by the solid line .",
    "the dotted line denotes the experimental equilibrium boundaries for the @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 phases of tizr obtained in ref .",
    "the experimental values of the @xmath56 transition at room temperature are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite .    on the whole , a good agreement of the calculated triple point ( @xmath57 gpa , @xmath58 k ) with the experimental values @xmath59 gpa , @xmath60 k @xcite is observed . at zero pressure",
    "the calculated temperature of the @xmath61 transition is @xmath62 k. this value is higher than the experimental one , @xmath63 k , defined in ref .",
    "@xcite as the average of the temperatures of the transition onset on heating and cooling .",
    "it should be noted that a large hysteresis is observed upon the @xmath64 transformation in tizr . at atmospheric pressure",
    "the maxima of thermal peaks in the dta curves fall on @xmath65 k on heating and @xmath66 k on cooling , the typical peak width being @xmath67 k. with this in mind , one can consider the results of calculation of the @xmath64 equilibrium boundary in the debye - grneisen model as quite satisfactory .    the greatest discrepancy between the theoretical calculation and the experimental evidence available is observed for the @xmath56 transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite the pressure at which this transition occurs at room temperature was estimated to be @xmath68 gpa .",
    "note thet equilibrium point of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases was determined under shear - strain conditions at pressures up to @xmath23 gpa .",
    "the shearing strain is known to lower the pressure at which the phase transition begins . presumably for this reason the authors of ref.@xcite failed to obtain the @xmath56 transition at room temperature under quasi - hydrostatic conditions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown by x - ray diffraction method that the @xmath2 phase of tizr remains the sole stable phase under quasi - hydrostatic pressure up to @xmath69 gpa . only from @xmath70 gpa on ,",
    "becomes dominating the @xmath3 phase which remains stable up to @xmath71 gpa . at pressures above",
    "@xmath71 gpa there forms a high - pressure phase with a bcc lattice .    as seen from fig.[fig : tizr_phase ] , in our calculation at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures the @xmath3 phase is stable , there occurs no @xmath56 transition at room temperature",
    ". note that in our calculations of pure ti @xcite and zr @xcite , in complete agreement with the experimental data , the @xmath2 phase is stable at atmospheric pressure and room temperature , and the @xmath3 phase is stable only under pressure . that the @xmath3 phase in tizr at normal conditions is energetically preferable , immediately follows from a comparison of the calculated free energies ( see fig.[fig : tizr_free ] ) .",
    "recall that the difference in energy between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 structures in the equiatomic tizr alloy is almost five times greater than in pure titanium and zirconium .",
    "the discrepancy between experiment and theory may be due to the fact that the calculation was performed for ideal crystalline structures ( see fig.[fig : tizr_cristal_structure]),whereas the experimental samples were imperfect crystals with lattice defects .",
    "in particular , it was shown @xcite that in a tizr alloy shear - strained under pressure the @xmath3 phase is represented by aggregations of oblong particles with characteristic size of @xmath72 nm , and @xmath73 nm long . if @xmath9phase particles are situated in a coarse grain of @xmath2 phase , they are mainly located at its boundaries .",
    "it was also noted @xcite that various imperfect structures in samples pre - treated in different ways have a noticeable effect on the course of structural transformations .",
    "evidently , we could not model a real structure in first - principles calculations .",
    "the correctness of our results may be supported by the following experimental evidence @xcite : firstly , the metastable @xmath3 phase was obtained at atmospheric pressure as a result of cooling of the @xmath4 phase under a pressure of 6 gpa with subsequent unloading at room temperature . secondly , between @xmath74 and @xmath21 gpa on cooling of the @xmath4 phase there forms a two - phase mixture of a stable @xmath2 and a metastable @xmath3 phase . and",
    "lastly , it was found that at atmospheric pressure the @xmath3 phase in the tizr alloy , when heated above @xmath18 k , transforms into an @xmath2 phase @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the temperature of this transformation was defined as @xmath75 k for @xmath76 gpa .",
    "this value differs by only @xmath77 k from the temperature @xmath78 k we have calculated for the @xmath79 transition .",
    "the above evidence suggests , in our opinion , that in the tizr alloy with ideal crystal lattice the phase diagram should look as it is depicted in fig.[fig : tizr_phase ] .",
    "of course , it must be taken into account that the debye - grneisen model , used for calculating the thermodynamic potentials , is a rather rough approximation and , obviously , can not ensure good accuracy , especially at high temperatures when the anharmonic effects become of considerable importance .",
    "it should be noted that at room temperature the pressure calculated for the @xmath80 transition is nearly half as large as the experimental value . because of low temperatures",
    ", we do not believe this discrepancy to be connected with the choice of the debye model for describing the thermodynamic properties .",
    "it is rather due to the deviation of real alloys from the ideal periodic structures used in calculating the total energy in the ground state .",
    "to estimate the tendency toward decomposition in @xmath9tizr in the ground state , the total energy was calculated for four structures ( see fig.[fig : rasl - reshetka ] ) .",
    "structure i was represented by layers of pure titanium and pure zirconium alternating along the @xmath40 axis and separated by intermediate mixed ti - zr layers . in the two - layer structure",
    "ii two layers of pure titanium alternated along the @xmath40 axis with two layers of pure zirconium with no intermediate layer . for structure iii",
    "were chosen six ti layers alternating with six zr layers without intermediate layer . and lastly , in variant iv five ti layers were separated by an intermediate layer from five zr layers .",
    "the free energy was calculated by the scalar relativistic full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( fplapw ) method , using the wien2k package@xcite . in the first two variants the number of atoms per unit cell was six ( 3 ti atoms and 3 zr atoms ) . in variants",
    "iii and iv the number of atoms in the cell amounted to 18 ( 9 atoms of each species ) .",
    "for variants i and ii structural optimization of the @xmath1 ratio was performed , and the equilibrium atom positions were defined with the procedure of minimizing the forces acting on atoms .    in fig.[fig : relax - energy ] the volume dependence of the lattice relaxation energy change @xmath81 is displayed for calculation variants i and ii . here @xmath82 is the total energy of the system with atomic arrangement corresponding to the ideal @xmath3 lattice ; @xmath83 is the system energy after minimization of the forces acting on atoms for a given volume .",
    "as seen from the figure , with decreasing volume the atoms become displaced from the positions corresponding to the ideal @xmath3 lattice , the displacement magnitude depending on the volume and the structure type .",
    "for the structure of type i , corresponding to the most uniform distribution of ti and zr atoms at @xmath84  @xmath53 , there occurs a sharp decrease of @xmath85 due to significant atomic rearrangement .",
    "for the two - layer system ( ii ) such a rearrangement is not observed in the considered interval of volume change . in fig.[fig : shift - atom ] , for @xmath86  @xmath53 are depicted the ( 110 ) planes , the arrows indicating the direction of atomic displacements on relaxation for the lattices of type i ( a ) and ii ( b ) ( the @xmath40 axis is pointing upwards ) .",
    "it is seen that in both cases the atomic displacements are directed only along the @xmath40 axis . in the two - layer system ( ii ) the atoms of titanium and zirconium are displaced in opposite directions , whereas in system i the atomic chain displacement occurs without strain .",
    "the displacements shown in fig.[fig : shift - atom](a ) correspond to those characteristic of the @xmath80 transition .",
    "the volume value @xmath87  @xmath53 at which begins a sharp decrease in @xmath85 , agrees well with the results of the total energy calculation for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 phases of tizr plotted in fig.[fig : tizr_total_energy ] .",
    "based on the data presented , we can draw an important conclusion that the pressure value at which occurs the @xmath80 transition depends substantially on the ordering type in the equiatomic tizr alloy .",
    "this also indirectly confirms our statement that the disagreement with the experiment concerning the @xmath88 equilibrium boundary position on the phase diagram calculated in the debye model ( fig.[fig : tizr_phase ] ) is caused by the presence of inhomogeneities in actual tizr alloys used in experiments in refs.@xcite .    the volume dependence of the total energy for the relaxed structures of type i and ii is plotted in fig.[fig : total - energy - i - ii - relax](a ) .",
    "as may be seen , in the whole range of volume change the energy is minimum for the structure of type i corresponding to the most uniform distribution of ti and zr atoms .",
    "recall that in variant i the lattice is represented by pure monolayers of titanium and zirconium separated by a mixed ti - zr layer , and in variant ii by a system of two ti layers alternating with two zr layers ( with no intermediate layer ) .",
    "thus , as decomposition grows , the system energy increases .",
    "this tendency persists on further decomposition , which may be seen in fig.[fig : total - energy - i - ii - relax](b ) , where the total energy is plotted versus volume for the structures of type ii , iii and iv . in the structure of type iv",
    "five ti layers are separated from five zr layers by a mixed intermediate layer , while in structure iii there are six layers of each metal without intermediate layer .",
    "it is seen from the figure that as the thickness of pure metal layers increases ( from one to five layers ) , the system energy significantly rises . as could be expected",
    ", the presence of an intermediate layer reduces the total energy of the system .",
    "this may be seen from a comparison of the energy values at @xmath89  @xmath53 for the calculation variants iii and iv ( structure iii is presented in the figure by a single point ) .    to summarize , the calculations performed show that in the ground state the @xmath3 phase of tizr exhibits a tendency toward ordering and not toward decomposition , as was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the total energy curves shows that the allowance for temperature effects in the debye - grneisen model will not change the energy relation between different calculation variants , and can not explain the experimentally observed formation of two @xmath3 structures .",
    "besides , we have not found any peculiarities connected with the s - d electron transition in the total - energy curves . thus , also the suggestion advanced in ref .",
    "@xcite that there exists an isostructural transition @xmath90 due to the pressure - induced changes in the electron structure , is not confirmed by the calculation . in our opinion ,",
    "the high - temperature decomposition in the @xmath3 phase of equiatomic tizr alloy is connected not with the change in electron structure under pressure , but with peculiarities of the lattice dynamics , in particular , with the presence of strongly anharmonic vibrational modes which are of crucial importance in stabilization of the @xmath3 lattice of pure titanium and zirconium@xcite .",
