    "npb was considered in a number of works ( see itoh et al .",

    "pethick & thorsson ( 1994 ) have shown that the band structure effects of electrons in solid matter drastically suppress the static lattice contribution to npb .",
    "finally , the reconsideration of the neutrino energy loss rate due to the electron - phonon scattering in the crystal phase was recently performed by two of us ( see yakovlev & kaminker 1996 ) . in the present paper",
    ", we will reconsider the problem of the calculation of the neutrino losses from npb in the hot neutron star crusts .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of a liquid phase of the crust ( temperature above melting temperature at given density ) .",
    "the actual nuclear composition of the crust depends on the formation scenario .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , our calculations will be performed for realistic models of nuclear composition , which are based on specific assumptions about the formation of the neutron star envelope .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we analyze physical conditions and nuclear composition of neutron star crusts .",
    "we discuss those differences between various neutron star crusts , which are important for the npb emissivities . in sect .",
    "3 we recalculate the npb energy generation rate for degenerate relativistic electrons and coulomb liquid of atomic nuclei . contrary to the previous works , we include the non - born corrections and the effects associated with thermal width of the electron fermi sphere .",

    "finite temperature corrections at @xmath35  k result in the presence of a very small fraction of free neutrons even at @xmath36 , with a negligible effect on the bulk composition of matter .",
    "the compositions of the outer and inner crusts depend on the scenario of formation of these outer layers .",
    "we consider three models of matter in a neutron star crust .",
    "the first model is based on the assumption that matter is in its ground state ( _ cold catalyzed matter _ ) .",
    "the second one is the model of _ accreted matter _",
    "valid when the neutron star accreted a sufficient amount of matter during its life .",
    "both models are appropriate for @xmath37  k. in both cases the nuclei are assumed to constitute a one - component plasma ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , which behaves either as a coulomb liquid ( @xmath40 ) or as a coulomb body - centered cubic crystal ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "in addition we consider ( sect",
    ". 2.4 ) the model of _ hot matter _",
    "valid for @xmath1  k.    some uncertainties in calculations of nuclear composition come from extrapolation of the laboratory nuclear physics to very large neutron excesses and huge pressures in neutron star crusts .",
    "these uncertainties are more important for the inner crust , and they increase with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "let us first consider the models of cold catalyzed and accreted matter in the _ outer crust _",
    "( @xmath36 ) .    at finite temperature",
    "the first model corresponds to a complete thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this assumption is certainly valid at @xmath43  k ( neutron star birth ) ; its validity is extrapolated to the later stages of neutron star cooling .",
    "this determines the composition at a given pressure ( density ) . in our analysis of the outer crust",
    ", we use the model of haensel & pichon ( 1994 ) based on the most recent experimental data on neutron rich nuclei .",
    "the model of accreted matter represents the case , in which matter _ is not _ in the ground state . at typical accretion rates onto a neutron star in a close binary system , freshly accreted hydrogen - rich matter burns into helium .",
    "the latter , in turn , burns explosively into @xmath44ni , which transforms eventually into @xmath44fe .",
    "the products of thermonuclear burning are subsequently compressed under the weight of accreted matter at relatively low temperature .",
    "for instance , at the accretion rate @xmath45 typical temperature within the crust is a few times of @xmath26  k. accordingly the only further nuclear processes in the steadily formed ` new outer crust ' are electron captures , which eventually lead to neutron drip at @xmath46 g  @xmath4 ( e.g. , haensel & zdunik 1990 ) .",
    "note , that at the accretion rate @xmath47 it takes @xmath48  yr to replace the original outer crust , built of catalyzed ( ground state ) matter , by the new one .",
    "the compositions of the accreted and cold catalyzed outer crusts are vastly different . at @xmath49  g  @xmath4",
    "the values of @xmath39 and @xmath38 in the accreted matter are less than half of those in the ground state .",
    "for instance , at the neutron drip we have @xmath39=18 , @xmath38=56 for the accreted matter ( haensel & zdunik 1990 ) and @xmath39=35 , @xmath38=118 for the cold catalyzed matter ( haensel & pichon 1994 ) . the neutron drip density , which separates the _ outer _ and _ inner _ crusts , is rather insensitive to the scenario of the outer crust formation ( cold catalyzed matter or accreted matter ) and/or to the model of nuclei present in the matter .",
    "irrespectively of the model , one gets @xmath50",
    "g  @xmath4 ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 , haensel et al .",
    "1989 , haensel & zdunik 1990 ) .    now consider the models of ground state and accreted matter in the _ inner crust _",
    "( @xmath51 ) . in both cases",
    "we assume that ( for @xmath52  g  @xmath4 ) matter is composed of spherical , neutron rich nuclei @xmath53 immersed in the electron and neutron gases . because of relatively low temperature , the only processes involved in the formation of the `` inner accreted crust '' are electron captures , neutron emission and absorption , and pycnonuclear fusion .    for the ground state matter at @xmath51 , we use the results of negele & vautherin ( 1973 ) .",
    "the model of accreted crust is taken from haensel & zdunik ( 1990 ) .",
    "we have constructed a specific model of an accreted crust for a neutron star which accreted @xmath54 .",
    "the bottom of the accreted layer is found at @xmath55  g  @xmath4 .",
    "both models are developed for a one component plasma ( single @xmath56 nuclide at a given pressure ) .",
    "this implies the onion structure of the crust , with fixed values of @xmath56 within certain pressure intervals .",
    "figures 1 and 2 present the relevant parameters of the ground state and accreted crusts versus density . the discontinuities in the values of @xmath57 are due to the shell and pairing effects in the binding energies of nuclei . notice a strong dependence of @xmath58 ( which is important for npb , sects .  3 and 4 ) on the crust formation scenario for @xmath59 .",
    "the values of @xmath58 for the accreted crust are about @xmath60 times lower than for the ground state .",
    "the differences of the melting temperature are even higher ( a factor of @xmath61 at @xmath62 g  @xmath4 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "the melting temperature of the ground state matter for @xmath63  g  @xmath4 is @xmath64  k. at such temperatures the thermal corrections to the composition of matter become important .",
    "let us notice that in the case of accreted crust at @xmath65 , the ion plasma temperature , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number density of nuclei ( ions ) and @xmath68 is their mass , becomes larger than the melting temperature of _ classical _ plasma .",
    "this seems to indicate , that corrections to @xmath69 , resulting from quantum ( zero  point ) vibrations of nuclei , might become significant .",
    "however , a quantitative analysis , based on the formulae derived by chabrier ( 1993 ) ( who corrected formulae obtained by mochkovitch & hansen ( 1979 ) ) shows , that even in the most extreme cases , corresponding to minima of @xmath69 at @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , quantum corrections to @xmath69 were about a few percent .",
    "in the case of the ground state of matter we have always @xmath71 , and so the quantum corrections to @xmath69 are even smaller .",
    "= 8.0 cm    = 8.0 cm      for @xmath72 , the thermal effects strongly modify the nuclear composition .",
    "both shell and pairing effects are washed out from the abundances of nuclei .",
    "also , reshuffling of nucleons is no longer blocked efficiently by coulomb barriers , and one can assume complete thermal equilibrium .",
    "we treat hot matter as a mixture of neutrons , protons , electrons , positrons and nuclei .",
    "in addition , we represent light nuclei by the @xmath73 particles , and heavy nuclei by a single species @xmath57 ( e.g. , burrows & lattimer 1984 ) .",
    "we describe the nuclei in hot dense matter , using the model of lattimer & swesty ( 1991 ) , with a specific choice of the equilibrium incompressibility of nuclear matter , @xmath74mev .",
    "we assume nuclear equilibrium , as well as beta equilibrium of matter .",
    "the assumption of nuclear equilibrium is justified by high temperature .",
    "beta equilibrium is adopted for simplicity : a very rapid cooling of matter at highest temperatures can produce some deviations from beta equilibrium .    figure 3 shows the composition of matter for @xmath28= @xmath75  k , @xmath76  k , and @xmath77  k. one can see a temperature dependence for @xmath78  g  @xmath4 . on the other hand , for @xmath79  g  @xmath4 , the temperature effects are negligible . if @xmath80  k , the thermal effects are weak and produce a small admixture of free neutrons at @xmath36 .",
    "the fraction of free neutrons for @xmath36 rapidly increases with growing temperature , and small fractions of @xmath73-particles and free protons appear at @xmath81  g  @xmath4 ( @xmath82  k ) . if @xmath83  k , the nuclei evaporate completely for @xmath84  g  @xmath4 , and the mass fraction contained in free neutrons is significant at any density under discussion . for @xmath79",
    "g  @xmath4 , the temperature effects are negligible .",
    "in contrast to the nuclear composition , the value of @xmath58 depends on temperature rather weakly ( fig .  4 ) .",

    "the pair emission involves weak interaction and can not be affected strongly by the born approximation .",
    "hence the main impact of the born approximation is on the elastic scattering cross section .",
