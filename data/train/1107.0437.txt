    "@xmath14 the distribution converges to the ergodic equilibrium with a homogeneous density in the plane @xmath4 .",
    "the exponential convergence to the equilibrium state is determined by the second eigenvalue @xmath15 of evolution ( [ eq2 ] ) on one map iteration with @xmath16 and the convergence rate @xmath17 the fist eigenvalue is @xmath18 .",
    "the dynamical equations ( [ eq1 ] ) are reversible in time , e.g. at the middle of free rotation , but , due to chaos and exponential instability of motion , small round - off errors break time reversal leading to an irreversible relaxation to the ergodic equilibrium @xcite .    in this work",

    "since it is fully chaotic , it has well defined diffusive relaxation to the ergodic state at large @xmath5 , and it is time reversible .",

    "the mechanism is related to the exponential growth of a wave packet of minimal size with time @xmath121 due to which the packet size becomes comparable with the whole system size after time @xmath120 or in our case after time @xmath87 .    in spite of this similarity we should note that in the quantum case the time reversal is preserved under rather generic conditions ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "in contrast to that in the frame of the ulam method , which also describes the linear matrix evolution , the time reversal is broken after the ulam time @xmath107 .",
    "the main reason of this difference is related to the fact that the ulam matrix approximant describes dynamics with eigenvalue modulus smaller than unity while the quantum dynamics is unitary .",
    "this result can be also understood from the view point of noise which have a size of discretized cells and which also breaks time reversal .",
    "in this work we studied the properties of the ulam matrix approximant @xmath27 , generated by the ulam method , for the arnold cat map on a torus of a few integer sections @xmath5 .",
    "we show that the spectrum eigenvalues of @xmath27 converges to a limiting distribution in the limit of small cell discretization and large matrix size @xmath28 .",
    "the main part of this spectrum have relaxation rates @xmath48 with approximate values of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy in this system .",
    "there are also eigenvalues with much smaller relaxation rate which is in a good agreement with the statistical description by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the continuous model has the property of time reversal but in the frame of the ulam method the time reversibility is broken on the ulam time scale @xmath107 which grows only logarithmically with the decrease of the cell size in the ulam method .",
    "such a dependence has certain parallels with that one found for the ehrenfest time scale in systems of quantum chaos .",
    "however , even if in both cases the evolution is described by the linear matrix equations the quantum systems preserves the property of time reversal in presence of weak perturbations , while for the ulam method the time reversal is broken after the ulam time scale @xmath107 .",
    "further studies are required for a better understanding of relations between the spectrum of the ulam matrix approximant , chaos , diffusion , correlations decay and other statistical properties of dynamical chaos in the arnold cat map and other chaos systems .",
