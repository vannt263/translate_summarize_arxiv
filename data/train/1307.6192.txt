    "clearly , if we apply the described operations to different permutations in @xmath81 , we will obtain different permutations in @xmath47 .",

    "[ theorem ] the permutation @xmath63 is a proper @xmath2-universal permutation for the set @xmath47 .",

    "this observation allows us to apply induction on the size of the graph with obvious base case on 1 vertex giving a permutation containing the only 321-avoiding permutation of size 1 .",
    "from the graph . ]    it is not hard to see based on figure  [ fig2 ] that a direct way to read off the permutation corresponding to the graph in figure  [ fig1 ] is to start with the element @xmath83 and to follow the ( solid and dashed ) arrows as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ; in the case of odd @xmath2 , the last row only has horizontal arrows ( say , solid ) going from left to right as shown schematically in the left picture in figure [ fig4 ] .",

    "two elements are said to be _ neighbor elements _ if they are connected by a vertical arrow .",
    "clearly , for two neighbors we always have that the bottom neighbor is larger than the top neighbor .",
    "also , it is straightforward to see from the structure of the graph that on the same row , elements increase from left to right .",
    "finally , a bottom element is always larger than the top element right below it .",
    "suppose that the statement is true for the case of @xmath76 and we would like to prove it for the case of @xmath2 .",
    "that is , if in the graph on @xmath62 vertices we remove the last row and the last column , then in the obtained graph , shown schematically shaded in figure [ fig4 ] , we can _ realize _ any @xmath4-avoiding permutation of length @xmath76 . by realization of a permutation of length @xmath76 we mean picking @xmath76 elements in the shaded area in figure [ fig4 ] , so that while going through the directed path in figure [ fig3 ] , the picked elements form the same relative order as the elements of the permutation .",
    "our goal is to show how to realize a @xmath4-avoiding permutation @xmath30 of length @xmath2 based on a realization of the permutation @xmath84 obtained from @xmath30 either by removing the largest element ( when @xmath30 does not end on @xmath76 ) , or by removing @xmath76 from the end of @xmath30 and then replacing @xmath2 with @xmath76 .",
    "note that the element @xmath62 is not in the shaded area .",
    "we distinguish here between two cases .    .",
    "we split this case into two subcases as follows .",
    "_ case 1.1 : @xmath30 does not end on @xmath76 .",
    "_ that is , in @xmath30 , @xmath76 is to the left of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath84 ends with the largest element , we can always take the element @xmath62 to extend the realization of @xmath84 to a realization of @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath76 is not the rightmost element in @xmath84 , then clearly the element corresponding to @xmath76 , say @xmath85 , must be in a bottom row , say , row @xmath51 ( @xmath51 is even ) .",
    "moreover , since the elements to the right of @xmath76 in @xmath84 must be in increasing order to avoid the pattern @xmath4 , and we have at most @xmath86 such elements , we know that those elements are chosen among the top elements in row @xmath87 weakly to the right of @xmath85 and , if @xmath88 , possibly among the top elements in row @xmath89 weakly to the left of @xmath85 . in either case , we can always extend the realization of @xmath84 to a realization of @xmath30 by picking a bottom element to the right of @xmath85 in row @xmath51 or weakly to the left of @xmath85 in row @xmath90 ( if it exists ) .",
    "indeed , if @xmath2 is next to the left of an element @xmath91 in @xmath30 , and vertex @xmath92 corresponds to @xmath91 in the realization of @xmath84 , then we can pick the ( bottom ) neighbor of @xmath92 to correspond to @xmath2 and thus to get a realization of @xmath30 . for example , if @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) and the realization of @xmath95 is the sequence 7 , 11 , 6 , 10 , that is , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , then the neighbor of @xmath92 is @xmath99 and a desired realization of @xmath30 is 7 , 11 , 17 , 6 , 10 ; see the left picture in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the only case when the described approach does not work is if the bottom neighbor of @xmath92 is @xmath85 itself . in this case",
    "we will take a different realization of @xmath84 obtained by one position shift to the right of all the elements already involved in the realization that are located weakly above or weakly to the right of @xmath85 including @xmath85 itself , and we pick the element directly below the shifted @xmath92 to obtain the desired outcome .",
    "see the respective subcase involving shifting in case 1.2 below for more details on why the shift works and for an example of applying the shift .",

    "_ if the element @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath76 in a realization of @xmath84 is in a top row , @xmath84 must end with @xmath76 and we can add the ( bottom ) neighbor of @xmath85 to the realization of @xmath84 to get a realization of @xmath30 ( then the neighbor of @xmath85 will correspond to @xmath2 , while the other elements in @xmath30 will have the same corresponding elements as those in @xmath84 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath85 is in a bottom row , say @xmath51 , then applying the same arguments as above , everything to the right of @xmath76 in @xmath84 can be realized by the elements weakly to the right of @xmath85 in ( top ) row @xmath87 and weakly to the left of @xmath85 in ( top ) row @xmath89 if @xmath88 .",
    "the worst case for us here is if the element directly below @xmath85 is involved in the realization of @xmath84 . in this case",

    "such a shift is always possible because we have the @xmath2-th column adjoined .",
    "also , such a shift does not change any order of elements involved in the initial realization of @xmath84 because there are no elements of the realization in the fourth quadrant and the positive @xmath85-axis with the origin at @xmath85 .",
    "for example , if @xmath94 , @xmath96 and 10 and , say 3 and 4 would be in a realization of @xmath84 , after the shift , we would have 10 , @xmath100 , 4 and 5 in the realization of @xmath84 instead of 10 , 11 , 3 and 4 , respectively ( see the left picture in figure  [ fig5 ] for layout of elements when @xmath94 ; the circles there should be ignored for the moment ) .    in either case , we can pick the element directly below @xmath85 to play the role of @xmath76 , while @xmath85 will be playing the role of @xmath2 in the obtained realization of @xmath30 .",
    "for example , if @xmath101 and a realization of @xmath95 is the sequence 7 , 11 , 6 , 10 as in our previous example ( @xmath96 here ) , then we can consider instead the realization of @xmath84 7 , 13 , 6 , 10 and 7 , 13 , 6 , 10 , 12 is a desired realization of @xmath30 ; see the left picture in figure  [ fig5 ] .    .    in this case",

    "of course , different examples should be provided in this case .",

    "the addition of edges can be done by analogy . since in the original graph the old vertices of each of @xmath151 ,",
    "@xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 form a vicinal chain , no edge has been added between any two old vertices . therefore , the resulting graph contains @xmath17 as an induced subgraph .",

    "we mean a permutation each element of which is assigned one of the two labels 1 or 2 so that the set of @xmath34-labelled elements forms an increasing sequence and the set of @xmath33-labelled elements forms an increasing sequence .",
    "notice that each @xmath4-avoiding permutation @xmath30 admits at least two possible labellings , while the total number of labellings is @xmath164 , where @xmath12 is the number of connected components of the permutation graph of @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the set of @xmath34-labelled elements of a permutation @xmath30 by @xmath165 and the set of @xmath33-labelled elements by @xmath166 . in other words",
    ", we assume that a permutation is labelled if it is given _ together _ with a partition @xmath167 of its elements into two increasing sequences .    by a labelled symmetric split permutation graph we mean a graph given _ together _ with a partition of its vertices into four sets @xmath168 satisfying ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "we also adapt the notion of containment relation ( pattern containment and induced subgraph containment ) to the case of labelled objects ( permutations and graphs ) in a natural way , i.e. elements of one object belonging to the same set in the given partition must be mapped to elements belonging to the corresponding set in the partition of the other object .",
    "[ lem : bijection ] there is a one - to - one correspondence @xmath169 between labelled @xmath4-avoiding permutations and labelled symmetric split permutation graphs .",
    "moreover , a @xmath4-avoiding permutation @xmath170 contains a @xmath4-avoiding permutation @xmath171 as a pattern if and only if @xmath172 contains @xmath173 as an induced subgraph .",
    "suppose we have a labelled @xmath4-avoiding permutation @xmath174 together with a partition @xmath167 .",
    "we associate a graph @xmath17 with @xmath69 vertices @xmath175 and @xmath176 , where    * @xmath137 with @xmath177 and @xmath178 , * @xmath138 with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "we define the set @xmath112 to be a clique and the set @xmath113 an independent set , i.e. @xmath17 is a split graph .",
    "the set of edges between @xmath112 and @xmath113 is defined by describing the neighbourhoods of the vertices of @xmath113 as follows :    * if @xmath181 , then @xmath182 , * if @xmath183 , then @xmath184 .    by construction , @xmath133 and @xmath134 form vicinal chains .",
    "also , from the description it follows that    * for any @xmath185 with @xmath186 we have @xmath187 and therefore @xmath129 forms a vicinal chain , * for any @xmath188 with @xmath186 we have @xmath187 and therefore @xmath130 forms a vicinal chain .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 is a split permutation graph .",
    "also , it is not difficult to see that    * @xmath189 with @xmath190 for each vertex @xmath191 , * @xmath192 with @xmath193 for each vertex @xmath194 .    therefore , @xmath17 is a symmetric split permutation graph .",
    "the sets @xmath168 define a labelling of this graph .",
    "the above procedure defines a mapping @xmath169 from the set of labelled 321-avoiding permutations of length @xmath2 to the set of labelled symmetric split permutation graphs with @xmath69 vertices .",
    "it is not difficult to see that different permutations are mapped to different graphs and hence the mapping is injective .",
    "now let us show that this mapping is surjective .",
    "let @xmath128 be a symmetric split permutation graph with @xmath69 vertices given together with a partition @xmath137 and @xmath138 satisfying ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "since @xmath17 is symmetric , for any two vertices @xmath195 we have @xmath196 .",
    "similarly , for any two vertices @xmath197 we have @xmath196 .",
    "moreover , the degree of each vertex of @xmath138 is a number between 1 and @xmath2 .",
    "now , define @xmath198 and @xmath199 and let @xmath30 be the permutation obtained by placing the elements of @xmath166 in the positions @xmath200 in the increasing order , and by placing the elements of @xmath165 in the remaining positions also increasingly .",
    "it is not hard to see that the labelled permutation @xmath30 with the partition @xmath201 is mapped to the graph @xmath17 , and thus , @xmath169 is a surjection .    in conclusion , @xmath169 is a bijection between labelled 321-avoiding permutations of length @xmath2 and labelled symmetric split permutation graphs with @xmath69 vertices .",
    "moreover , this bijection not only maps a permutation @xmath30 to a graph @xmath128 , it also maps bijectively the elements of @xmath30 to @xmath112 and to @xmath113 as described in the above procedure .",
    "this mapping from the elements of the permutation to the vertices of the graph proves the second part of the lemma .",
    "there is a split permutation graph with @xmath5 vertices containing all split permutation graphs with @xmath2 vertices as induced subgraphs .",
    "first , let us define the notion of concatenation of two permutations of the same length .",
    "given two permutations @xmath170 and @xmath171 of length @xmath2 , the concatenation @xmath202 is the permutation of length @xmath69 obtained by placing the elements of @xmath171 to the right of @xmath170 and by increasing every element of @xmath171 by @xmath2 .",
    "also , by @xmath203 we denote the concatenation of @xmath2 copies of @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath63 be the @xmath2-universal @xmath4-avoiding permutation of theorem  [ theorem ] .",
    "since the permutation graph of @xmath63 is connected ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , there are exactly two ways to label the elements of @xmath63 .",
    "we denote by @xmath204 and @xmath205 the two labellings of @xmath63 .",
    "then the concatenation @xmath206 is universal for labelled @xmath4-avoiding permutations whose permutation graphs are connected .",
    "since every graph with @xmath2 vertices contains at most @xmath2 connected components , the permutation @xmath207 is universal for the set of all labelled @xmath4-avoiding permutations of length @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , @xmath208 is @xmath4-avoiding and hence the graph @xmath209 is a symmetric split permutation graph .",
    "since @xmath208 contains all labelled @xmath4-avoiding permutations of length @xmath2 , by lemma  [ lem : bijection ] @xmath209 contains all labelled symmetric split permutation graphs with @xmath69 vertices . therefore , by lemma  [ lem:2n ] , @xmath209 is an @xmath2-universal split permutation graph .",
    "since the length of @xmath63 is @xmath62 , the length of @xmath208 is @xmath210 , and hence the number of vertices of @xmath209 is @xmath5 .",
    "one natural question to ask is whether the constructions of universal permutations and universal graphs obtained in this paper are best possible in terms of their sizes . as a matter of fact , for @xmath211 ,",
    "the permutation @xmath63 constructed in section  [ sec : per ] does not seem to be a shortest possible proper @xmath2-universal @xmath4-avoiding permutation .",
    "for example , it seems that we can always delete a few rightmost elements in this permutation without violating the property of being @xmath2-universal . for the small values of @xmath2 , the optimal permutations with respect to deleting rightmost elements in @xmath63 are as follows : @xmath212    this observation leads naturally to the following question : how far can we shorten the permutation @xmath63 ( not necessarily from the right side ) keeping the property of being @xmath2-universal . in particular , asymptotically , can we do better than @xmath62 for the length assuming that we start with @xmath63 and remove some elements ?",
    "of course , a natural direction here is not to limit ourselves to @xmath63 , but instead to find a proper @xmath2-universal @xmath4-avoiding permutation of the shortest possible length .    to state one more open problem , let us observe that the split permutation graphs are precisely the permutation graphs of @xmath213-avoiding permutations .",
    "the trivial idea of constructing an @xmath2-universal permutation for this set by concatenating all permutations of length @xmath2 from the set immediately moves us outside of the set , as a forbidden pattern arises .",
    "this partly explains the difficulty of constructing _ proper _ universal split permutation graphs .",
    "can the construction obtained in this paper for split permutation graphs be used to construct universal @xmath213-avoiding permutations ?",
    "finally , as we mentioned in the introduction , finding a proper _ infinite _ universal split permutation graph with countably many vertices is a challenging research problem .",
    "the authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for many valuable comments that helped to improve significantly the presentation of our results ."
