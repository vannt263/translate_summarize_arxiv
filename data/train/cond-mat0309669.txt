    "the integer quantum hall ( qh ) transitions are described well in terms of a series of delocalization - localization transitions of the electron wavefunction @xcite .",
    "these universal plateau - plateau transitions are accompanied by a power - law divergence @xmath5 of the electronic localization length @xmath6 , where @xmath7 defines the distance to the transition for a suitable controlled parameter , e.g.  the electron energy @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is now conclusively established that plateau - plateau and insulator - plateau transitions exhibit the same critical behavior @xcite .    however , the value of the hall resistance @xmath8 in this insulating phase ( at large magnetic field ) is still rather controversial .",
    "various experiments have found that @xmath8 remains very close to its quantized value @xmath9 even deep in the insulating regime @xcite with longitudinal resistance @xmath10 .",
    "this scenario has been dubbed the _",
    "quantized hall insulator_. on the other hand , theoretical predictions show that a diverging @xmath8 should be expected , i.e. , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this _ hall insulator _ is to be expected at strong disorder or strong magnetic fields .    in fully quantum coherent transport measurements such as in mesoscopic devices at low temperature ,",
    "the results clearly show the paramount influence of quantum interference and the measured quantities fluctuate strongly @xcite . at magnetic field @xmath12",
    ", the universal conductance fluctuations provide the most famous example @xcite . for the qh situation ,",
    "similarly reproducible and pronounced fluctuations have been observed previously @xcite , although no complete understanding of their behavior has yet emerged .",
    "thus for quantum coherent qh samples , the average values @xmath13 and @xmath8 become meaningless unless their full distributions are being taken into account @xcite . consequently , different averaging procedures may then yield quite different estimates for @xmath13 and @xmath8 .    in the present manuscript ,",
    "we revisit the hall insulating regime by using a real - space renormalization group ( rg ) approach to the chalker - coddington ( cc ) network model , recently used successfully to study the energy - level statistics at the qh transition as well as the influence of long - range correlations in the disorder potential close to the transition @xcite .",
    "we will show when considering the experimentally relevant most probable value as estimate for @xmath8 , we find quantized @xmath14 for @xmath15 and increasing values for larger @xmath13 thereby reconciling the experimental results of a quantized @xmath8 available up to @xmath16 @xcite with the theoretical predictions of the hall insulator .",
    "the cc model is based on the microscopic picture of electron motion in a strong magnetic field and a smooth disorder potential@xcite when only the semiclassical trajectories of the guiding center of the cyclotron orbit are important . assigning these trajectories to _ links _ and considering saddle points ( sp s ) at which different trajectories come closer than the larmor radius as _ nodes _",
    "a chiral network can be constructed .",
    "we now apply a real - space rg approach @xcite to the cc network @xcite .",
    "the rg unit we use is extracted from a cc network on a regular 2d square lattice as shown in fig.[fig - rgstruct ] .",
    "a super - sp consists of five original sp s by analogy to the rg unit employed for the 2d bond percolation problem @xcite .",
    "each sp can be described by two matrix equations relating the wavefunction amplitudes in incoming and outgoing channels . between the sp s",
    "an electron travels along equipotential lines , and accumulates a certain aharonov - bohm phase @xmath17 .",
    "different phases are uncorrelated , which reflects the randomness of the original potential landscape .",
    "this results in a system of ten linear equations , the solution of which yields the expression for the transmission coefficient of the super - sp @xcite @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the transmission and reflection coefficients of the constituting sp s , @xmath21 are the phases accumulated along the closed loops ( see fig .  [ fig - rgstruct ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq - qhrg ] ) is the rg transformation , which allows one to generate ( after averaging over @xmath21 ) the distribution @xmath22 of the transmission coefficients of super - sp s using the distribution @xmath23 of the transmission coefficients of the original sp s . since the transmission coefficients of the original sp s depend on the electron energy @xmath24",
    ", the fact that delocalization occurs at @xmath25 implies that a certain distribution , @xmath26  with @xmath27 being symmetric with respect to @xmath28  is a fixed point ( fp ) of the rg transformation ( [ eq - qhrg ] ) .",
    "the distribution @xmath29 of the dimensionless two - point conductance @xmath30 can be obtained from the relation @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 .",

    "the voltage is computed , analogously to the experimental situation , by subtracting opposite magnetic field directions .",
    "the hall voltage is then defined as @xmath39 - \\left [ \\mu_{15}(-b ) - \\mu_{42}(-b )      \\right ] \\right\\ } \\quad .\\ ] ] consequently , the _ dimensionless _ hall resistance is given by @xmath40",
    "in order to find the fp distributions @xmath41 and @xmath42 at the qh transition , we start from an appropriate initial distribution of transmission coefficients , @xmath43 . the rg procedure results in a broad distribution @xmath44 which is peaked at @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "any rg flow away from this instable fp towards the insulating regimes will result in a further increase of one of these peaks . therefore , in order to reliably model the insulating regime , an accurate procedure for reproducing these peaks is needed . in @xcite , we had also shown that a distribution @xmath47 of dimensionless sp heights is related to @xmath48 via @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 .",
    "thus the peaks in @xmath48 transform into long but quickly decaying tails in @xmath47 and it is numerically much better to perform the rg for sp heights @xmath51 when the physics away from the fp is studied .",

    "we check that the values of @xmath73 do not influence our results and that all the previous results at the qh transition as in refs .",
    "@xcite are reproduced .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the fp distribution @xmath74 is about @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "in figs .  [ fig - p_rl_linlog ] and",
    "[ fig - p_rh ] , we show the fp distributions for @xmath13 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "as seen previously @xcite , both distributions are manifestly non - gaussian with rather long tails .",
    "indeed , @xmath76 can be fitted by a log - normal distribution as indicated in fig.[fig - p_rl_linlog ] @xcite .",
    "the fp distribution @xmath77 exhibits a pronounced peak at @xmath78 ( @xmath9 in si units ) and a small shoulder around @xmath79 .",
    "the small weight for negative hall resistances shows that in the coherent rg structure chosen , the large fluctuations in @xmath23 can result in an apparent reversal of the hall voltage .",
    "in order to model the transition into the insulating regime , we now shift the initial distribution @xmath80 by a small @xmath81 . for @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ", the rg flow will then drive the distributions into the insulating , @xmath84 , and plateau , @xmath85 , regimes , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig - p_rl_linlog ] and [ fig - p_rh ] , we show the resulting distributions after many rg steps . for @xmath76",
    ", we see in fig .",
    "[ fig - p_rl_linlog ] that the flow towards @xmath85 results in a decrease of large @xmath13 events , whereas conversely , the regime @xmath84 leads to an increase in large @xmath13 values and a decrease of the maximum value in @xmath76 . for @xmath2 , fig .",
    "[ fig - p_rh ] shows that the plateau regime @xmath85 gives a highly singular peak at the dimensionless quantized hall value @xmath86 , corresponding to a perfect hall plateau . on the other hand",
    ", the insulating regime @xmath87 shows an increase of weight in the tails of @xmath2 and the eventual obliteration of any central peak .    in order to extract an averaged @xmath13 and @xmath8 from these non - standard distributions",
    ", we should now select an appropriate mean @xmath88 that characterizes and captures the essential physics and allows comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the precise operational definition is also important as it corresponds to different possible experimental setups .",
    "therefore , we consider several means : ( i ) arithmetic @xmath89 , ( ii ) geometric / typical @xmath90 , ( iii ) median ( central value ) @xmath91 , where @xmath92 denotes the number of samples ( @xmath93 ) in each case . the median and the typical mean ( and their variances",
    "@xcite ) are less sensitive to extreme values than other means ( such as , e.g.  root - mean - square and harmonic mean ) and this makes them a better measure for highly skewed and long - tailed distributions such as @xmath76 and @xmath2 in the insulating regime . in the plateau regimes , the distributions are less skewed , particularly for @xmath8 and the difference in the means becomes less important .",
    "we are left with determining in which operational order to apply the averaging procedure . for @xmath13 , as measured via ohm s law ( [ eq - rl ] ) as a ratio , it is obvious that the appropriate average should be @xmath94 ( and not @xmath95 ) . for @xmath8 , the situation is less straightforward due to the definition of @xmath96 in ( [ eq - vh ] ) .",
    "a simple average is @xmath97 , i.e. using the appropriate @xmath2 .",
    "similar to the experimental procedure , we can also estimate @xmath98 via @xmath99 for each @xmath100 field direction separately . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been suggested that a more appropriate average @xmath101 can be constructed from @xmath102 .",
    "this later procedure corresponds to measuring the voltage drop between positions @xmath37 and @xmath38 in fig.[fig - rgstruct ] by separately measuring the individual voltages with respect to ground and then recombining them .    in figs .",
    "[ fig - rhrl - loglog ] and [ fig - rhrl - linlin ] we show the resulting dependence @xmath103 when these averaging definitions are being used .",
    "these figures are our main result . in the plateau regime @xmath104 , the nearly constant behavior of all @xmath8 averages",
    "is as expected . for @xmath105",
    ", we get a divergent @xmath8 when using the median and typical means as suggested by refs.@xcite to compute both @xmath13 and @xmath8 .",
    "this divergence can be captured by a power - law @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "the arithmetic mean for large @xmath108 quickly becomes instable and no useful information can be inferred . reducing the information to the experimentally more relevant resistance regime of a few times",
    "@xmath9 , we replot the @xmath109 and @xmath8 data in fig .",
    "[ fig - rhrl - linlin ] .",
    "in addition to the three means above , we also show the behavior of the most - probable value @xmath110 at which @xmath2 has a maximum .",
    "this estimate @xmath111 appears relevant in the experimental setup where @xmath65 different samples can not be easily measured and the full distribution functions can not be constructed in similar detail .",
    "most importantly , for the range of @xmath13 values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rhrl - linlin ] , the value of @xmath110 deviates only slightly from its quantized value @xmath86 at the transition and @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the experimental estimate of @xmath113 appears to support the notion of the quantized hall insulator .",
    "indeed , the deviations from @xmath86 are less than @xmath114 until @xmath115 . however , going back to fig .",
    "[ fig - rhrl - loglog ] , we see that in the strongly insulating regime @xmath105 also @xmath110 diverges with a power - law that is well - described by @xmath116 .",
    "we emphasize that fluctuations in @xmath110 for large @xmath117 are due to numerical inaccuracies in @xmath2 and decrease upon further increasing the number of samples .",
    "the results for @xmath13 and @xmath8 in the localized regime can be very well described by an exponential scaling function with finite - size correction @xcite @xmath118 $ ] .",
    "plotting @xmath119 as a function of small perturbation @xmath81 , we find @xmath120 with @xmath121 as shown in fig.[fig - xi_z0_loglog ] .",
    "thus we recover the universal divergence of the localization length @xmath6 even when using the rg in the insulating regime @xcite .",
    "an equally reliable estimate of the irrelevant exponent @xmath122 appears not possible for our data . as usual",
    ", the 4-terminal resistances can be converted into the respective conductances via @xmath123 . for these conductances ,",
    "one expects the semi - circle law @xmath124 to hold @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig - sxxsxy_linlin ] , we show that the most - probable values capture the overall shape and symmetry properties best @xcite , the other averages show pronounced deviations .",
    "we also note that the relation @xmath125 is obeyed by all means @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the reflection symmetry of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we have shown in a quantum coherent calculation that the insulating hall behavior of @xmath126 is dominated by the power - law divergence @xmath127 . however , up to previously experimentally reached @xmath128 @xcite , the deviation from a quantized @xmath78 is very small and the onset of the divergence for @xmath129 is yet to be explored .",
