    "122 is a prototypical member of the new family of fe - pnictides that play host to high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the stoichiometric compound suffers a coupled structural and antiferromagnetic transition at @xmath7 140 k @xcite .",
    "suppression of the broken - symmetry state by either applied pressure @xcite or chemical doping @xcite results in superconductivity , and one of the key questions associated with this entire class of material is the role played by spin fuctuations associated with the incipient tendency towards magnetism @xcite",
    ".    initial work on chemical substitution in 122 focused on the hole - doped material 122 @xcite . in this case",
    ", it has been established that the structural / magnetic transition is totally suppressed for k concentrations above @xmath8 @xcite , whereas superconductivity appears for a wide range of concentrations from @xmath9 = 0.3 to 1 @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that co - substitution ( i.e. 122 ) also suppresses the magnetic and structural transitions , eventually leading to superconductivity @xcite .",
    "co - doped 122 is especially attractive for two reasons .",
    "first , from a fundamental point of view , this material allows an exploration of the interrelation between the structural / magnetic phase transitions with superconductivity in the context of an electron - doped system .",
    "secondly , from a more practical perspective , crystal growth using cobalt does not suffer from the inherent difficulties associated with using potassium .",
    "cobalt has neither a large vapor pressure nor attacks the quartz tubing used to encapsulate the growths .",
    "it is thus possible to obtain more homogeneous crystals and more reproducible synthesis conditions than is otherwise feasible for potassium - doped samples .    in this paper we present results of resistivity , hall coefficient , heat capacity and susceptibility measurements of single crystal samples of 122 .",
    "we find that the structural / magnetic phase transition which occurs at 134 k in 122 is rapidly suppressed , and splits in to two successive phase transitions with increasing co concentration .",
    "the signatures of these two distinct phase transitions are relatively sharp , and it is unlikely that this effect is associated with phase separation due to a variation in co concentration across an individual sample .",
    "superconductivity appears for co concentrations @xmath10 , with a maximum @xmath11 for a co concentration of @xmath5 , coincident with the concentration at which the structural / magnetic phase transitions are suppressed below .",
    "the apparent coexistence of superconductivity with the broken - symmetry state on the underdoped side of the phase diagram is unlikely to be due to phase separation due to co inhomogeneity , and mirrors what is seen for 122 @xcite .",
    "these measurements establish an essential symmetry between electron and hole doping of 122 , in which the appearance of superconductivity in both cases is clearly associated with suppression of the magnetic / structural phase transitions .",
    "nevertheless , there are some clear differences that emerge from this study .",
    "specifically , co - substitution is found to be significantly more effective at suppressing the structural / magnetic phase transitions than k - substitution , and the superconducting `` dome '' extends over a much smaller range of doping .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is highly suggestive that superconductivity is intimately related to the presence of a quantum critical point associated with suppression the structural and/or magnetic phase transitions .",
    "single crystals of 122 were grown from a self flux using similar conditions to published methods @xcite .",
    "ba and feas in the molar ration 1:4 with additional co were placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in evacuated quartz tubes .",
    "the mixture was heated to 1150c , and held for 24 hours , before slowly cooling to 1000 c , at which temperature the remaining flux was decanted using a centrifuge .",
    "the crystals have a plate - like morphology , with the @xmath12-axis perpendicular to the plane of the plates , and grow up to several millimeters on a side .",
    "the co concentration was measured by electron microprobe analysis ( empa ) using undoped 122 and elemental co as standards .",
    "measurements were made at several locations on each sample .",
    "measured values were close to the nominal melt composition in all cases , and the variation in co concentration across individual samples was typically characterized by a standard deviation of @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , the co concentration corresponding to optimal doping is @xmath9 = 0.061 @xmath14 0.002 .",
    "temperature dependence of the in - plane ( @xmath15 ) resistivity of 122 .",

    "successive data sets are offset vertically by 0.1 for clarity ( except for @xmath16 data , which is offset by 1.4 ) .",
    "values of the co - concentration @xmath9 are listed in the legend , and were determined by microprobe analysis for all concentrations except the specific sample with @xmath17 , for which @xmath9 was estimated based on the observed linear relation between nominal and actual @xmath9.,width=321 ]    ( a ) heat capacity data for four representative co concentrations ( @xmath9 = 0 , 0.016 , 0.025 , 0.036 and 0.061 ) showing the suppression of the structural / magnetic phase transitions with increasing co concentration .",

    "is evident from a sharp drop to zero in the resistivity , while the anomaly associated with the structural / magnetic phase transition is still observable in the normal state . as @xmath9 increases beyond this value , the superconducting critical temperature  ( defined here as the midpoint of the resistive transition ) increases , whereas the magnetic / structural anomaly continues to be suppressed .",

    "we show the resistivity and heat capacity anomaly near these transitions for the undoped and two lightly doped samples .",
    "it is evident that the single sharp downturn in 122 becomes two successive sharp changes in slope in the resistivity of the lightly doped 122 . as for the heat capacity , the single sharp first - order peak observed for undoped 122 , becomes two distinct features , resembling a second order - like step followed by a lower temperature peak , reminiscent of a broadened first - order transition .    to further investigate the apparent splitting of the structural / magnetic phase transitions ,",
    "magnetic susceptibility and hall coefficient data were also measured .",
    "results are shown in fig [ g3 ] for two representative co concentrations .",
    "significantly , both measurements indicate the presence of two distinct phase transitions for @xmath33 evidenced by distinct breaks in the slope of each quantity . in the case of the susceptibility",
    ", this effect is more clearly apparent as two peaks in the derivative @xmath34 .",
    "these data can be compared with the heat capacity measurements ( right axis of the upper panels ) , where we have explicitly subtracted the normal state heat capacity of the optimal doped 122 with @xmath25 as described above , to provide an estimate of the contribution to the heat capacity arising from the two phase transitions .",
    "the background subtracted heat capacity is in excellent agreement with the derivative @xmath34 of the susceptibility , which is proportional to the heat capacity near a second - order phase transition@xcite .",
    "these data are also in excellent agreement with the derivative of the resistivity @xmath35 . in short , all four measurements indicate unambiguously the presence of two distinct phase transitions .",
    "it is very unlikely that this splitting arises from co inhomogeneity , which in it s simplest form would cause a continuous broadening rather than a distinct splitting of the two phase transitions . indeed , the presence of co inhomogeneity can be inferred from the broadening of each of these two phase transitions ( fig .",

    "data for co concentrations up to @xmath9 = 0.051 are shown in figure [ cpdr ] .",
    "as can be seen , both transitions , marked as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are broadened with increasing co concentration , but the two specific features which can be associated with the critical temperatures for @xmath9 = 0.016 , 0.025 and 0.036 remain visible in the resistivity derivative even for @xmath9 = 0.045 and 0.051 . for larger values of the co concentration ,",

    "data points for @xmath38 and @xmath39 were obtained from heat capacity , resistivity , hall coefficient and susceptibility data for @xmath9 = 0 , 0.016 , 0.025 and 0.036 , and from resistivity data alone for @xmath9 = 0.045 and 0.051 .",

    "uncertainty in the co concentration corresponds to less than the width of the data markers.,width=321 ]    the apparent coexistence of superconductivity with the broken symmetry sdw state on the underdoped side of the phase diagram raises the question of whether there is macroscopic phase separation associated with a variation in the co concentration .",
    "for length scales above one micron this can be ruled out based on the microprobe analysis .",
    "specifically , the standard deviation in the cobalt doping is much smaller than the range across which we observed this coexistence . from a materials viewpoint",
    "it would also be surprising to find co inhomogeneity on shorter length scales given the large solid solubility .",

    "measurements were made in a field of 50 oe applied parallel to the @xmath43-plane of the single crystals.,width=321 ]    susceptibility data were taken for representative co concentrations on the underdoped and overdoped side of the phase diagram , as well as for an optimally doped sample .",
    "these measurements were made for applied fields of 50 oe , oriented in the @xmath43-plane , for both zero - field cooling and field cooling cycles .",
    "the measurements were then repeated for each sample after grinding to a fine powder to examine the role of screening currents .",
    "the results of these measurements are shown in fig [ fczfc ] .",
    "first we consider the single crystal data ( black data points ) .",
    "field cooled values are relatively small for each co concentration , indicative of substantial flux trapping .",
    "however , zero - field cooled values are large for both underdoped , optimally doped and overdoped cases indicating the presence of significant screening currents .",
    "these values do not change substantially when the single crystals are ground to fine powders ( red data points ) for the optimally doped and overdoped cases , but significantly the underdoped material has a substantially smaller value for the zfc susceptibility .",
    "it is clear that the underdoped material is still a bulk superconductor .",
    "however , the ability of the underdoped material to support screening currents is significantly reduced by powdering .",
    "this effect might be related to the carrier concentration .",
    "specifically , the superfluid density will presumably be smaller for the underdoped material given the coexistence with the sdw state , leading to larger values for the penetration depth . in this case , it is possible that some fraction of the grains in the finely powdered sample will have a size smaller than the penetration depth , reducing the zfc susceptibility .",
    "equally , it is possible that powdering causes significant damage to the surface of the resulting grains .",
    "the asymmetry of the superconducting dome might then lead to a stronger suppression of superconductivity for underdoped relative to overdoped samples .",
    "most intriguingly , the lower zfc susceptibility might also reflect the presence of intrinsic inhomogeneity on the underdoped side of the phase diagram , because the percolating shielding currents do not encompass the entire sample .",
    "the current measurements are not sufficient to determine the origin of this rather dramatic effect on the susceptibility .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that there is a substantial volume fraction even in the underdoped region of the phase diagram , but that the superconductivity is to some extent more fragile , at least to the effect of powdering .",
    "the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] is highly suggestive of a scenario in which the superconductivity is intimately related to the presence of a quantum critical point associated with the eventual suppression of the structural and/or magnetic phase transitions .",
    "clearly this needs to be investigated in greater detail .",
    "nevertheless , this observation raises the question of whether a similar mechanism is at work in the hole doped analog 122 , and more broadly for all of the superconducting fe - pnictides . in the specific case of 122 ,",
    "co - doping is clearly more effective at suppressing the magnetic / structural transitions than k - doping , but it remains to be determined whether this is related to an asymmetry in the electronic structure or to other possibilities .",
    "during preparation of this manuscript we became aware of two similar studies of the effects of co - substitution in 122 recently posted on the arxiv.org preprint server .",
    "in the first of these , ni _ et . al . _ map out a similar phase diagram , also finding a splitting of the magnetic / structural phase transition @xcite .",
    "these results broadly corroborate our findings . in the second , ning _ et . al .",
    "_ use nmr measurements to follow spin dynamics for representative underdoped and overdoped samples , also surmising the presence of a quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have determined the phase diagram for the electron - doped superconductor 122 .",
    "we find that the single structural / magnetic phase transition that occurs in 122 splits with co - doping , although the nature of the two split transitions remains to be determined .",
    "critical temperatures associated with both transitions are progressively reduced with increasing co concentration , and are suppressed below @xmath11 coincident with optimal doping .",
    "the superconducting `` dome '' extends over a limited range of co concentrations , from @xmath9 = 0.025 to @xmath9 = 0.18 .",
