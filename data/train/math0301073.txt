    "in the framework of symplectic topology , viterbo s proof of the weinstein conjecture , @xcite , and its refinement , the almost existence theorem , are among the most important results concerning the existence of periodic orbits of autonomous hamiltonian systems .",
    "the almost existence theorem , proved by h. hofer and e. zehnder , @xcite , and by m. struwe , @xcite , asserts that almost all ( in the sense of measure theory ) regular levels of a proper @xmath0-smooth function on @xmath1 carry periodic orbits of the hamiltonian flow . in the last decade , these theorems have been extended to a broad class of symplectic manifolds ; see , e.g. , @xcite . however , as has been noted by e. zehnder , the almost existence theorem fails for a general symplectic manifold ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we prove a relative version of the almost existence theorem .",
    "namely , consider a function @xmath2 on a geometrically bounded symplectically aspherical manifold @xmath3 , with its minimum ( say , equal to zero ) attained along a closed symplectic submanifold @xmath4 .",
    "the relative almost existence theorem asserts that the levels @xmath5 carry contractible periodic orbits of the hamiltonian flow of @xmath2 for almost all small @xmath6 .",
    "this result strengthens a theorem of @xcite guaranteeing the existence of periodic orbits for a dense set of values of @xmath2 near zero .",
    "this investigation has been inspired by the existence problem for periodic orbits of twisted geodesic flows ( see section [ subsec : magnetic ] for definitions ) . as an immediate consequence of the relative almost existence theorem",
    ", we obtain the existence of contractible twisted geodesics on almost all low energy levels , provided that the magnetic field is symplectic  a result strengthening or complementing numerous other results on the existence of twisted geodesics ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    when @xmath4 is a morse non - degenerate minimum of @xmath2 as is the case , for instance , for twisted geodesic flows , the flow has , hypothetically , a periodic orbit on every low energy level .",
    "moreover , one can expect a certain lower bound on the number of such periodic orbits in terms of the cohomology and codimension of @xmath4 .",
    "this conjecture can be thought of as a plausible generalization of the weinstein ",
    "moser theorem , @xcite .",
    "( we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of this conjecture and the proofs of certain particular cases . ) the relative almost existence theorem provides further evidence supporting the conjecture .    note that unless the minimum of @xmath2 along @xmath4 is assumed to be morse ",
    "bott non - degenerate , periodic orbits of the flow need not exist on all levels of @xmath2 near the minimum . in a variety of settings ,",
    "we construct hamiltonians @xmath2 such that for some sequence of regular values @xmath7 the levels @xmath8 carry no periodic orbits of the flow ; see section [ sec : counterexamples ] . in these examples ,",
    "zero is an isolated , but very degenerate , critical value .",
    "such hamiltonians also exist on the standard cotangent bundles to spheres .",
    "these examples are obtained by combining a. katok s construction , @xcite , the elimination of periodic orbits as in @xcite , and a suitable smoothing procedure , @xcite ; see sections [ sec : counterexamples ] and [ sec : counterexamples - prfs ] .",
    "similarly to the original almost existence theorem and to many other results of this type , the proof of the relative almost existence theorem is comprised of two steps .",
    "the first step is showing that the flow of a hamiltonian with sufficiently large variation has a non - trivial contractible one - periodic orbit .",
    "more precisely , we consider a hamiltonian @xmath9 supported in a neighborhood of @xmath4 , constant near @xmath4 , and attaining its maximum along @xmath4 .",
    "then , if the maximum is large enough , the flow has a non - trivial contractible one - periodic orbit .",
    "this is proved by showing that the floer homology of @xmath9 does not vanish for an interval of actions @xmath10 with @xmath11 ( to ensure that the orbit is non - trivial ) .",
    "note that establishing the existence of non - trivial one - periodic orbits is a common first step in proving almost existence theorems .",
    "for instance , our theorem generalizes a theorem proved in @xcite .",
    "similar theorems , under no assumptions on @xmath3 , but with some additional constraints on the normal bundle to @xmath4 ( e.g. , that the normal bundle is trivial ) , have been proved in @xcite .",
    "we also prove a ( relatively easy ) version of this theorem for time - dependent flows along the lines of @xcite . here , the orbits are still contractible , but not necessarily non - trivial .",
    "the second step is to introduce the relative hofer ",
    "zehnder capacity .",
    "this capacity is defined as in @xcite , but for functions constant near @xmath4 . the existence theorem for one - periodic orbits guarantees that the capacity of a small neighborhood of @xmath4 relative to @xmath4 is finite .",
    "the almost existence theorem follows now , exactly as in @xcite , from the fact that the capacity of the sets @xmath12 is an increasing function of @xmath6 .",
    "the idea to consider the relative hofer ",
    "zehnder capacity goes back to @xcite , and a number of existence results akin to those proved here can be interpreted as calculations of this capacity ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "certain other versions of relative capacity have been recently introduced , @xcite , but , to the best of our knowledge , the relative hofer ",
    "zehnder capacity has not been put to systematic use till now .",
    "it should be noted that it is not known whether or not this capacity differs from the original hofer  zehnder capacity for neighborhoods of symplectic submanifolds ( see example [ exam : chz - c0 ] and section [ sec : other - cap ] ) .",
    "yet , in this setting , we can only establish finiteness of the relative capacity , and hence this capacity readily lends itself as a convenient tool for proving almost existence results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : main ] , we state the main results of the paper and define and briefly discuss the relative hofer  zehnder capacity . the version of the theorem on the existence of one - periodic orbits for time - dependent hamiltonians is stated in section [ sec : time - dep ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is essentially devoted to the proofs .",
    "the main goal of section [ sec : prelim ] is to recall some background results and definitions needed for the proofs , in particular , those concerning filtered floer homology . in section [ sec :",
    "pfs ] , we prove the main theorems on the existence of one - periodic orbits ( both the autonomous and time - dependent cases ) . in section",
    "[ sec : capacity - pf ] , we further discuss the relative hofer  zehnder capacity , compare it with some other capacities , and prove its properties stated in section [ sec : main ] .",

    "[ sec : other - cap ] arguments used to prove finiteness of a capacity or the existence of periodic orbits can often be turned into a definition of a new capacity , bounding the original one from above ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is no exception .",
    "this leads to the notion of a restricted homological capacity @xmath563 which bounds @xmath562 from above and is equal to @xmath564 on @xmath565 .",

    ". then we can modify @xmath42 within @xmath13 so that the resulting function @xmath624 is isotopic to @xmath42 but has @xmath633 as the level @xmath614 .",
    "the next step is eliminating , as above , all periodic orbits on the level @xmath614 .",
    "the resulting function is now @xmath0-smooth .",

    "as before , the proof for @xmath163 is concluded by applying lemma [ lemma : smoothing ] .",
    "a. katok s example of a finsler metric on @xmath637 with only two closed geodesics can be easily described via a similar construction of the hypersurface @xmath633 , starting with the level @xmath638 , in the standard @xmath639 , and then symplectically embedding its double cover into @xmath631 .        fix a level @xmath642 .",
    "the first observation is that we can change @xmath641 in a neighborhood of @xmath642 to a function of the form @xmath643 , without altering the level sets of the function or creating critical points , so that the new function @xmath42 is equal to @xmath641 outside the neighborhood and its flow has constant period ( say , equal to one ) near the level @xmath642 . without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath644 , and hence the level we are working with is again @xmath628 .",
    "the next step is to notice that ziller s method , @xcite , applies to the function @xmath42 near the level @xmath628 , i.e. , one can modify @xmath42 near the level to a @xmath144-function @xmath624 , isotopic to @xmath42 , so that the level @xmath614 carries only a finite number of periodic orbits .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us describe this modification in detail .",
    "as in @xcite , consider the action of @xmath645 on @xmath646 induced by the following diagonal @xmath647-action on @xmath648 : @xmath649 where @xmath650 are mutually distinct integers and @xmath651 . this action preserves @xmath117 and @xmath641 and hence the lift @xmath513 of this action to @xmath640 preserves @xmath42 and the twisted symplectic structure @xmath43 . the flow @xmath513 is hamiltonian .",
    "denote the hamiltonian of @xmath513 by @xmath652 and set @xmath653 where @xmath654 is a small irrational number .",
    "note that since @xmath174 is small , the level @xmath614 lies near @xmath628 and , hence , is entirely contained in the region where the flow of @xmath42 has period one .",
    "we claim that the flow of @xmath624 on @xmath640 has a finite number of periodic orbits on the level @xmath614 ( and on nearby levels ) .    to prove this , let us first note that the closed orbits of the flow of @xmath624 near the level are in fact the closed orbits of @xmath42 which are invariant under the flow @xmath513 .",
    "this can be easily checked by using the fact that the two flows commute and repeating word - for - word the reasoning from @xcite .",
    "it follows that the projections of these periodic orbits of @xmath42 to @xmath646 are invariant under the @xmath647-action .",
    "next observe that every orbit of @xmath42 is a reparametrized orbit of the twisted geodesic flow on @xmath642 .",
    "hence , it suffices to show that the number of @xmath647-invariant twisted geodesics on @xmath646 coming from @xmath642 is finite .",
    "let @xmath655 be a twisted geodesic .",
    "the initial conditions @xmath656 determine a projective line @xmath657 and @xmath655 is tangent to this @xmath658 .",
    "furthermore , this projective line is invariant under the @xmath647-action if @xmath655 is invariant .",
    "( these facts can be seen as follows .",
    "it is well known that @xmath655 is the projection under the hopf map of a great circle @xmath659 in @xmath660 .",
    "the angle between @xmath659 and the hopf fibers is determined by @xmath173 and lies in the interval @xmath661 .",
    "thus @xmath662 and @xmath663 span a complex plane in @xmath648 .",
    "this complex plane gives rise to the projective line corresponding to @xmath655 and is invariant under the action if @xmath655 is invariant . )",
    "it is easy to see that there are only finitely many ( in fact , @xmath664 ) projective lines invariant under the action .",
    "( these projective lines arise from the @xmath665-planes , @xmath666 . ) on such a projective line , the twisted geodesic @xmath655 is an ( oriented ) @xmath647-invariant spherical circle whose geodesic curvature is determined by @xmath173 .",
    "there are only two such oriented circles .",
    "thus , as we have shown , the flow of @xmath624 on the level @xmath614 has a finite number of periodic orbits .",
    "let us modify @xmath624 outside of a small neighborhood of @xmath614 so that the resulting function , which we denote by @xmath624 again , is @xmath144-smooth , equal to @xmath42 outside the neighborhood of @xmath628 , and isotopic to @xmath42 .",
    "the proof is finished in the same way as for @xmath163 .",

    "this leads to a @xmath144-smooth ( since @xmath667 ) function which is again isotopic to @xmath42 .",
