    "a central issue in complexity science and engineering is systems identification and dynamical behavior prediction based on experimental or observational data . for a complex networked system , often the network structure and the nodal dynamical processes are unknown but only time series measured from various nodes in the network can be obtained .",
    "the challenging task is to infer the detailed network topology and the nodal dynamical systems from the available data .",
    "this line of pursuit started in biomedical science for problems such as identification of gene regulatory networks from expression data in systems biology  @xcite and uncovering various functional networks in the human brain from activation data in neuroscience  @xcite .",
    "the inverse problem has also been an area of research in statistical physics where , for example , the inverse ising problem in static  @xcite and kinetic  @xcite situations has attracted continuous interest .",
    "recent years have witnessed the emergence and growth of a subfield of research in complex networks : data based network identification ( or reverse engineering of complex networks )  @xcite . in these works , the success of mapping out the entire network structure and estimating the nodal dynamical equations partly relies on taking advantage of the particular properties of the system dynamics in terms of the specific types and rules .",
    "for example , depending on the detailed dynamical processes such as continuous - time oscillations  @xcite , evolutionary games  @xcite , or epidemic spreading  @xcite , appropriate mathematical frameworks uniquely tailored at the specific underlying dynamical process can be formulated to solve the inverse problem .    in this paper , we address the following challenging question : is it possible to develop a universal and completely data - driven framework for extracting network topology and identifying the dynamical processes , without the need to know a priori the specific types of network dynamics ?",
    "an answer to this question would be of significant value not only to complexity science and engineering but also to modern data science where the goal is to unearth the hidden structural information and to predict the future evolution of the system .",
    "here we introduce the concept of _ universal structural estimator and dynamics approximator _ for complex networked systems and demonstrate that such a framework or `` machine '' can indeed be developed for a large number of distinct types of network dynamical processes .",
    "our approach will be a combination of numerical computation and physical reasoning .",
    "since we are yet able to develop a rigorous mathematical framework , the present work should be regarded as an initial attempt towards the development of a universal framework for network reconstruction and dynamics prediction .",
    "the key principle underlying our work is the following . in spite of the difference among the types of dynamics in terms of ,",
    "e.g. , the interaction patterns and state updating rules , there are two common features shared by many dynamical processes on complex networks : ( 1 ) they are stochastic , first - order markovian processes , i.e. , only the current state of the system determines its immediate future ; and ( 2 ) the nodal interactions are local , i.e. , a node typically interacts with its neighboring nodes , not all the nodes in the network .",
    "the two features are characteristic of a _ markov network _ ( or a _ markov random field _ )  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a markov network is an undirected and weighted probabilistic graphical model that is effective at determining the complex probabilistic interdependencies in situations where the directionality in the interaction between connected nodes can not be naturally assigned , in contrast to the directed bayesian networks  @xcite .",
    "a markov network has two types of parameters : a nodal bias parameter that controls its preference of the state choice , and a weight parameter characterizing the interaction strength of each undirected link . for a network of @xmath0 nodes with @xmath1 being the state of node @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , the joint probability distribution of the state variables @xmath4",
    "is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the potential function for a well - connected network clique @xmath7 , and the summation in the denominator is over all possible system state @xmath8 .",
    "if this joint probability distribution is available , all conditional probability interdependencies can be obtained . the way to define a clique and to determine its potential function plays a key role in the markov network s representation power of modeling the interdependencies within a particular system .    to be concrete ,",
    "in this work we pursue the possibility of modeling the conditional probability interdependencies of a variety of dynamical processes on complex networked systems via a binary ising markov network with its potential function in the form of the boltzmann factor , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the energy determined by the local states and their interactions along with the network parameters ( the link weights and node biases ) in a _ log - linear _",
    "form  @xcite .",
    "this is effectively a sparse boltzmann machine  @xcite adopted to complex network topologies without hidden units .",
    "( note that hidden units usually play a crucial role in ordinary boltzmann machines  @xcite ) .",
    "we introduce a temporal evolution mechanism as a persistent sampling process for such a machine based on the conditional probabilities obtained via the joint probability , and generate a markov chain of persistently sampled state configurations to form the state transition time series for each node .",
    "we call our model a _ sparse dynamical boltzmann machine _ ( sdbm )",
    ".     nodes .",
    "the connections of the network are assumed to be unknown , so the red node can potentially be connected with any other node , as shown by the orange dashed links . executing compressive sensing [ ( c ) ] and the k - means clustering [ fig.[fig : kmeans ] ] for this node based on time series leads to its true connection structure , marked by the red links . the link weights and the nodal bias",
    "are represented by the vector @xmath11 in ( c ) .",
    "( b ) all true connections of the network are recovered through the process in ( a ) for each node .",
    "the markov blanket of the red node in ( a ) consists of all its nearest neighbors , indicated by the nodes with dashed red circles .",
    "( c ) a schematic illustration of the compressive sensing framework for structural reconstruction as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final_eq ] ) . ]    for a dynamical process on complex networks , such as epidemic spreading or evolutionary game dynamics , the state of each node at the next time step is determined by the probability conditioned on the current states of its neighbors ( and its own state in some cases ) .",
    "there is freedom to manipulate the conditional probabilities that dictate the system behavior in the immediate future by adjusting the values of its parameters , i.e. , the weights and biases .",
    "a basic question is then , for an sdbm , is it possible to properly choose these parameters so that the conditional probabilities so produced are identical or nearly identical to those of the network dynamical process with each given observed system state configuration ? if the answer is affirmative , the sdbm can serve as a dynamics approximator of the original system , and the approximated conditional probabilities possess predictive power for the system state at the next time step .",
    "when such an sdbm is found for many types of dynamical process on complex networks , it effectively serves as a universal dynamics approximator .",
    "moreover , if the detailed statistical properties of the state configurations can be reproduced in the long time limit , that is , if the time series generated by this sdbm are statistically identical or nearly identical to those from the original system , then the sdbm will be a generative model of the observed data ( in the language of machine learning ) , which is potentially capable of long term prediction .    when a dynamics approximator exists for the dynamics on a complex network , the topology of the sdbm is nothing but that of the original network , providing a simultaneous solution to the problem of network structure reconstruction .",
    "previous works on the inverse static or kinetic ising problems led to methods of reconstruction for ising dynamics by maximizing the data likelihood ( or pseudo - likelihood ) function via the gradient descent approaches  @xcite . instead of adopting these approaches , as a part of our methodology to extract the network structure , we articulate a compressive sensing  @xcite based approach , whose working power has been demonstrated for a variety types of non - ising type of dynamics on complex networks  @xcite . by incorporating the k - means clustering algorithm into the sparse solution obtained from compressive sensing , we demonstrate that nearly perfect reconstruction of the complex network topology can be achieved . using @xmath12 different types of dynamical processes on complex networks , we find that , if the time series data generated by these dynamical processes are assumed to be from its equivalent sdbms , the universal reconstruction framework is capable of recovering the underlying network structure for each type of original dynamics with practically zero error . this represents solid and concrete evidence that sdbm is capable of serving as a universal structural estimator for complex networks .",
    "in addition to being able to precisely reconstruct the network topology , the sdbm also allows the link weights and nodal biases to be calculated with high accuracy .",
    "our method is fully automated and does not require any subjective parameter choice .",
    "for an sdbm of size @xmath0 , the probability that the system is in a particular binary state configuration @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total energy of the network in @xmath8 : @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath1 are binary variables ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) characterizing the states of nodes @xmath20 and @xmath2 , respectively , and @xmath21 is a weighted matrix with its off diagonal elements @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) specifying the weight associated with the link between nodes @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",

    "@xcite at time @xmath47 , identical configurations at other time steps imply identical conditional probabilities .",
    "thus , given time series data of the dynamical process , the conditional probability can be estimated according to the law of large numbers by averaging over the states of @xmath20 at all the time steps prior to the neighboring state configurations becoming identical .",
    "note , however , that this probability needs to be conditioned on the state configuration of the entire system except node @xmath20 , i.e. , on @xmath48 , and the average of @xmath17 is calculated over all the time steps @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 .",
    "this means that there can be a dramatic increase in the configuration size , i.e. , from @xmath51 ( the degree of node @xmath20 ) to @xmath52 ( the size of the vector @xmath29 ) , which can make the number of exactly identical configurations too small to give any meaningful statistics . to overcome this difficulty , we allow a small amount of dissimilarity between @xmath53 and @xmath54 by introducing a tolerance parameter , @xmath55 , to confine the corresponding hamming distances normalized by @xmath0 . in particular , we assume @xmath56 if the relative difference between them is not larger than @xmath57 .",

    "universality is fundamentally possible due to the fact that many dynamical processes on complex networks are of the markov type and the interactions among the nodes are local . as a result , utilizing basic tools from machine learning and statistical physics , one can build up an energy based markov network model ( e.g. , a sparse dynamical boltzmann machine ) to construct a universal estimator and approximator for different types of complex network structures and dynamics . for a large number of representative dynamical processes studied in this paper ,",
    "we demonstrate that such a universal sdbm can be reconstructed based on compressive sensing and the scheme of k - means using data only , without requiring any extra information about the network structure or the dynamical process .",
    "the working of the sdbm is demonstrated using a large number of combinations of the network structure and dynamics , including many real world networks and classic evolutionary game dynamics .",
    "an sdbm with its parameters given by the equations constructed from the times series along with the estimated network structure is able to reproduce the conditional probabilities quantitatively and , accordingly , it is capable of predicting the state configuration at least in a short term .",
    "we demonstrate that , for certain types of dynamics , the approximator can reproduce the dynamical process statistically , indicating the potential of its serving as a generative model for long term prediction in such cases ( supplementary note 5 ) .    while we assume binary dynamics , in principle the methodology",
    "can be applied to other types of dynamical processes . in particular , eq .",
    "can be readily extended to the conditional probability of each possible state value @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath130 .",
    "a potential difficulty is that the configuration space of the system states grows exponentially with the number of choices of @xmath129 so that , given a finite amount of data , the number of time instances corresponding to each particular configuration decreases exponentially , leading to a significant reduction in the estimation precision of the conditional probability .",
    "our effort represents an initial attempt to realize a universal estimator and approximator , and the performance of our method is quite competitive in comparison with the existing reconstruction schemes designed for specific types of dynamics , such as the compressive sensing technique for evolutionary game and epidemic spreading dynamics  @xcite , as well as methods adopting the bethe approximation , pseudo - likelihood , mean - field theory , and decimation operation for static and kinetic inverse ising problems  @xcite . in realistic applications",
    ", the data obtained may be discontinuous or incomplete .",
    "in such cases , the short - term predictive power possessed by the universal estimator and approximator can be exploited to overcome the difficulty of missing data , as the markov network nature of the sdbm makes backward inference possible so that the system configurations during the time periods of missing data may be inferred . when long term prediction is possible , the universal approximator has the critical capability of simulating the system behavior and predicting the chance that the system state enters into a global absorption phase , which may find significant applications such as disaster early warning .",
    "another interesting reverse - engineering problem lies in the mapping between the original dynamics and the corresponding parameter value distribution of the reconstructed sdbm .",
    "that is , a certain parameter distribution of the sdbm may indicate a specific type of the original dynamics . as such , the correspondence can be used for precisely identifying nonlinear and complex networked dynamical systems .",
    "it is also possible to assess the relative importance of the nodes and links in a complex network based on their corresponding biases and weights in the reconstructed sdbm for controlling the network dynamics .",
