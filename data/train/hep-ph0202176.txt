    "we use the approximation of massless leptons , so that our results are also valid for the decays @xmath11 in this approach .",
    "because of their phenomenological importance , processes involving the production of vector bosons and jets have been considered by many authors .",

    "this is the first paper to calculate vector boson processes with two jets at next - to - leading order .",
    "in performing these calculations we have used the results of other authors for the crossed reactions @xmath15  @xcite and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "even with the amplitudes in hand , the implementation in a monte carlo program requires considerable effort .    in order to highlight the similarities between the effects of radiative corrections on the @xmath17 rate and the @xmath18 rate",
    ", we will also present some results for the latter process .",
    "such corrections have been known for some time  @xcite and have provided an invaluable tool for studies at the tevatron .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath18 processes in mcfm was useful to understand the issues to be faced in implementing the more complicated @xmath17 processes .",
    "we will also tie together our results with previous predictions made using mcfm  @xcite to provide a consistent next - to - leading order prediction for the heavy flavor content of jets produced in association with a @xmath19 .",

    "these amplitudes have been calculated in the four dimensional helicity scheme , which we consistently use throughout this program .",
    "the real corrections to the basic born processes ,  the processes , @xmath30 have been published in @xcite and a representative sample of the contributing diagrams is shown in fig .",

    "these matrix elements are incorporated in mcfm using the subtraction method of ellis , ross and terrano  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one constructs counterterms having the same singularity structure as the real emission matrix elements , starting from the eikonal formula for soft emission .",
    "the basic operating procedure is to create subtraction terms which contain the same singularity structure as the lowest order diagrams , but are simple enough that they are can be integrated over the phase space of the unobserved parton . in order to improve the cancellation ,",
    "the kinematics of the counterterms are included using the prescription of catani and seymour  @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath32  jets there are 24 different counterterms , each with its own kinematic structure , ( a _ counterevent _ ) .",
    "the kinematics of the final state partons in the counterevents coincide with the kinematics of the event in the appropriate soft and collinear limits .",
    "the matrix elements for hadroproduction of @xmath19 + 3 partons contain many singularities which are subtracted by ( dipole ) counterterms .",
    "although the enumeration of these counterterms is in principle straightforward , the success of the whole program depends on it being implemented correctly .",
    "we shall therefore present a few details of the checks which we performed .",
    "the real matrix elements were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite supplemented in certain cases by our own calculations .",
    "the coding of these matrix elements was checked by comparison with routines generated by the program madgraph  @xcite powered by helas  @xcite .",
    "we can not use the routines generated by madgraph directly because the resulting code is too slow to implement in a monte carlo program which requires many calls to the matrix element routine .",
    "the next step is to verify that the numerical value of the counterterms is in fact equal in magnitude to the real matrix element in the singular limit .",
    "this is done by generating sets of points which lie in all of the potentially singular regions and then checking the cancellation of the event and the appropriate counterevent in each limit .",
    "finally , we must add back the counterterms , suitably integrated over the phase space of the emitted parton .",
    "here it is clearly important to add back exactly what has been subtracted in the previous step .",
    "we have tried to structure the code so that the comparison between the two steps is transparent .",
    "the integral of the counterterms over the emitted parton sub - space contains singularities , which are regulated using dimensional regularization , in addition to finite contributions .",
    "the code is structured so that the finite parts are closely associated with the singular parts .",
    "thus the cancellation of the singular parts , ( with the sum of the singular parts of the virtual matrix elements and the altarelli - parisi factorization counterterms for the parton distributions ) , provides some assurance that the finite terms are included correctly .",
    "mcfm has a number of default electroweak parameters which we use throughout this paper .",

    "there are , for example , no @xmath45 initial states for this case .",
    "this approximation is not expected to influence any anticipated analyses . for the other processes",
    "we retain only the cabibbo sector of the ckm matrix , @xmath46    the value of @xmath47 is not adjustable ; it is determined by the chosen parton distribution . a collection of modern parton distribution functions is included with mcfm ,",
    "but here we concentrate only on one of the mrst2001  @xcite sets with @xmath48 .",
    "we refer to this set as mrs0119 , which is the label used in our program .",
    "for all the results presented here , we consider only a positively charged @xmath12 and choose the leptonic decays , @xmath49 in this paper we shall present results for the tevatron collider only and we pick a simple set of cuts accordingly .",
    "all leptons satisfy , @xmath50 and for the @xmath12 case there is also a cut on the missing transverse momentum , @xmath51 .",
    "our final requirement is that the dilepton mass be greater than @xmath52 .",
    "although this has no effect in the @xmath12 case , it prevents the production of soft @xmath53 pairs which would otherwise be copiously produced by the virtual photon in the @xmath7 process .",
    "jets are found using the run ii @xmath54 clustering algorithm  @xcite with a pseudo - cone of size @xmath55 , and are also subject to , @xmath56 for the new results on @xmath57 production , in this paper we will mostly consider events where exactly 2 jets are found by the algorithm , i.e. exclusive 2 jet production .",
    "the inclusive production of jets - which would include events with 3 jets at next - to - leading order - is a further option in mcfm that will only be touched on briefly here .",
    "the principle motivation for performing a next - to - leading order calculation is to reduce the uncertainties in leading order predictions . in particular",
    ", any perturbative prediction contains an unphysical dependence on renormalization and factorization scales ( often chosen to be equal , as we shall do here ) .",
    "the magnitude of cross - sections and the shape of differential distributions can vary greatly between two different choices of scale , which is often interpreted as an inherent `` theoretical uncertainty '' which is then ascribed to the predictions .",
    "another strategy is to argue for a particular choice of scale , based on the physics of the process under consideration .",
    "a next - to - leading order calculation is an invaluable tool for investigating the issue of scale dependence .",
    "the logarithms that are responsible for the large variations under changes of scale at leading order are exactly canceled through to next - to - leading order . as a result",
    ", one expects that next - to - leading order predictions are more stable under such variations .",
    "in addition , the next - to - leading order result may provide further evidence to support a particular scale choice that may have been deemed appropriate at leading order .    as an example of expected results , in figure  [ scaledep_wz1jet ] we show the scale dependence of the exclusive @xmath12 and @xmath58 + 1 jet differential cross - sections @xmath59 , integrated over the range @xmath60 .",
    "the next - to - leading order predictions have been known for some time  @xcite , but here are calculated within our program , mcfm . for both processes ,",
    "the leading order prediction rises sharply as the scale is decreased , while the corrections produce a far flatter curve that exhibits a much less pronounced dependence on the scale choice .",
    "the corresponding new results for the @xmath29-jet processes are shown in figure  [ scaledep_wz2jet ] . as in the @xmath61-jet case ,",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are set equal and the basic cuts mentioned in the previous section are applied .",
    "in addition , we now use the dijet mass differential distribution , @xmath62 integrated over @xmath63 gev . as anticipated",
    ", both processes show a considerable reduction in scale dependence .",
    "for example , the ratio of the leading order prediction for the @xmath12 process using a hard scale @xmath64 to the result for a far softer scale @xmath65 is , @xmath66 while the same ratio at next - to - leading order is only , @xmath67      once again , we repeat some @xmath69  jet results , in order to highlight both the similarities and the differences with the corresponding @xmath29-jet distributions .        in figure  [ ptdep_wz1jet ]",
    "we show the jet @xmath68 distribution for both of the @xmath61-jet cases , using a relatively hard choice of scale , @xmath70  gev .",
    "we first note that since we are considering the exclusive jet cross - section , the rise of the distributions at low @xmath68 is limited only by the jet cut , @xmath71  gev . at next - to - leading order the distributions change significantly to become much softer . at high @xmath68",
    "a single jet is much more likely to radiate a soft parton ( that passes the fixed @xmath68 cut and is counted as an extra jet ) , thus removing it from the sample  @xcite .",
    "the situation for the @xmath29-jet processes is shown in figure  [ ptdep_wz2jet ] , where we plot the @xmath68 distribution of the hardest jet , again using @xmath70  gev .",
    "in contrast with the previous figure , the distributions turn over at small @xmath68 . if the highest @xmath68 jet has a @xmath72  gev , there is little phase space for the emission of a second softer jet with @xmath73  gev .",
    "we also see that including the radiative corrections softens the distribution considerably , for the same reason as before . for the @xmath12 case",
    ", we also show the _ inclusive _ distribution ,  the cross section for the production of two or more jets .",
    "this ` fills in ' the high-@xmath74 tail of the distribution .",
    "we would like to estimate the fraction of @xmath76  jet events that contain two heavy quark jets .",
    "we will limit our discussion to @xmath20 quarks , because they can be tagged with high efficiency . in order to do so , we recall the next - to - leading order results for the production of a @xmath77 in association with a @xmath12 , reported in  @xcite . as a reminder to the reader",
    ", we work in the approximation in which the @xmath20 quarks are taken to be massless and we have ignored contributions from processes in which there are two @xmath20 quarks already present in the initial state .",
    "the basic lowest order diagrams for this process are shown in fig .",

    "the same approximations apply as discussed above for the @xmath12 case .",
    "the notable difference now is that there are more lowest order diagrams , as shown in fig .",
    "[ zbb_born ] , including an initial state composed only of gluons .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , these latter diagrams with initial gluons are believed to be responsible for the sizeable corrections to the basic process at large @xmath80 .",
    "sample diagrams for the process @xmath81.,width=325 ]    an immediate concern is that neglecting the @xmath20-quark mass may be unjustified  @xcite . at low values of @xmath82 ,",
    "quark mass effects may be important . to address these concerns , in figure  [ comp_wbbbar_mass ] we compare the lowest order @xmath82 distribution calculated using the full mass dependence with the result obtained by setting @xmath83 .",
    "there are two effects of introducing a mass for the @xmath20-quark .",
    "firstly , the phase - space becomes smaller , leading to a reduction of the cross - section .",
    "on the other hand , the matrix elements receive extra contributions proportional to powers of @xmath84 which may increase the result .",
    "as shown in figure  [ comp_wbbbar_mass ] , the matrix element effects dominate around the peak of the distribution where they are as large as 5% .",
    "closer to threshold the phase space effects are dominant . at large @xmath82 the quark mass effects are quite small as expected .          in order to compare the results for @xmath20-quark jets with those for the whole @xmath29-jet sample",
    ", we will show the differential cross - section as a function of the dijet mass .",
    "we use two choices of scale in these analyses , a hard scale @xmath85  gev and a softer scale @xmath86  gev .",
    "these are the scales used for the plots shown in figures  [ comp_wbbbar_w_2jet ]  and  [ comp_zbbbar_z_2jet ] , where both the leading order and the radiative corrections are shown for comparison .                as with the @xmath68 distributions of the previous section , the shapes of the distributions change",
    "when the qcd corrections are included .",
    "for both the @xmath87 and general @xmath29  jet distributions , the hard scale causes the dijet cross - section to increase at next - to - leading order for small values of @xmath24 .",
    "the radiative corrections using the soft scale cause a considerable depletion in the cross - section at high @xmath24 . however , the shapes of the @xmath87 and @xmath29  jet distributions appear very similar when compared at the same order of perturbation theory and using the same scale .    in fig .",
    "[ bb_ratio ] we show the cross section for events that contain @xmath29 @xmath20-tags divided by the cross section for all two jet events , as a function of the dijet mass .",
    "as can be seen , for the @xmath12 this ratio does not depend very strongly on either the choice of scale or the order in perturbation theory .",
    "the percentage falls at low values of @xmath24 until @xmath88  gev , where it becomes approximately constant at @xmath89 . for the @xmath58 ,",
    "the proportion is fairly constant at approximately @xmath90 for all the curves except for the case of next - to - leading order at @xmath91  gev . in this case",
    "the percentage rises at high @xmath24 .",
    "the origin of this effect may be associated with the extra diagrams present in the @xmath58 case and requires further study .",
    "we have presented the first results for the implementation of @xmath92 jet production at next - to - leading order in a general purpose monte carlo . an analysis based on exclusive jet production for run",
    "ii of the tevatron shows that the usual benefits of next - to - leading order are realized , among them being a reduced scale dependence and hence an improved normalization for distributions .",
    "we also find changes in the shapes of distributions similar to those found in the @xmath61-jet case .",
    "these modifications are reduced if we consider the inclusive cross - section .",
    "we performed an analysis of the heavy flavor content of jets produced in association with a vector boson .",
    "for production in association with a @xmath12 , the ratio of @xmath20-tagged to untagged jets changes very little upon the inclusion of radiative corrections and appears to be predicted very well by perturbation theory .",
