    "two major candidates are the class of weakly interacting massive particles , and the qcd axion .",

    "a relic ulalp population can be produced thermally ( generated from the radiation bath ) or nonthermally by the vacuum realignment mechanism .",
    "the former class of ulalps behaves like dark radiation . in this paper , we are solely interested in ulalps generated by the vacuum realignment mechanism , which behave like cold dark matter .    in sec .",
    "ii , we show that ulalps thermalize via gravitational self - interactions and hence form a bose - einstein condensate , in a manner analogous to qcd axions .",
    "this is something that the previous works have not taken into account . in sec.iii",
    ", we estimate a lower mass bound on ulalps by requiring that the infalling ulalps do not excessively heat the galactic disk stars . in sec .",
    "iv , we obtain a stronger bound from the sharpness of the fifth caustic ring of the milky way galaxy which appears as a triangular feature in infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) and planck maps .",
    "v provides a summary .",
    "bose - einstein condensation occurs if the following conditions are satisfied : i ) the system is composed of a huge number of identical bosons , ii ) these particles are highly degenerate , iii ) their number is conserved , and iv ) they thermalize .",
    "bose - einstein condensation means that most of the particles go to the lowest energy state available through the thermalizing interactions .",
    "we show below that the cold ulalp fluid produced by the vacuum realignment mechanism satisfies all four conditions .",
    "the ulalp is described by two parameters : its mass @xmath12 , which sets the time when the ulalp field begins to oscillate in the early universe and its decay constant @xmath13 , with dimensions of energy , which sets the magnitude of its initial misalignment and the strength of its interactions .",
    "unlike the case of qcd axions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are independent parameters . also , unlike the case of qcd axions",
    ", the ulalp mass is taken to be temperature independent .",
    "the time when the ulalp field starts to oscillate is of order @xmath14 .",
    "the ulalps produced by the vacuum realignment mechanism @xcite have at that time number density @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the value of the field then .",
    "@xmath16 is of order the decay constant @xmath13 .",
    "after @xmath17 , the number of ulalps is conserved .",
    "so their number density at later times is n(t)~m _",
    "1 ^ 2 ( ) ^3 , [ eq : density ] where @xmath18 is the cosmic scale factor . by demanding that the ulalps make up the majority of cdm",
    ", we relate their initial number density to their mass , n(t_1)~()^2 ( ) ^3/2 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the age of the universe and cold dark matter density today , respectively .",
    "we assumed that @xmath21 is in the radiation - dominated era , which requires @xmath22 ev .",
    "we have therefore _ 1 ~ ~3 10 ^ 17  gev ( 10 ^ -22  ev m)^1 4 .",
    "if inflation does not homogenize the ulalp field , the cold ulalps produced by vacuum realignment have momentum dispersion of order p(t)~ ( ) , [ momdis ] and hence their average state occupation number is ~ ~5 10 ^ 98 ( 10 ^ -22  ev m)^5 2 . [ eq : occ_n ] if inflation does homogenize the ulalp field , the momentum dispersion is smaller yet , and the average quantum state occupation number is higher .",
    "therefore , the ulalps certainly form a highly degenerate bose gas .",
    "the decay rate of ulalps into two photons , in analogy with the qcd axion , is of order _",
    "a~()^2 = 1 2.5 10 ^ 110  sec ( m 10 ^ -22  ev)^3 ( 10 ^ 17  gev f)^2 where @xmath23 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the ulalp is thus stable on the time scale of the age of the universe .",
    "more generally , because all ulalp number changing interactions are suppressed by one or more powers of @xmath24 , the number of ulalps is conserved on time scales of order the age of the universe .",
    "so , the third condition for ulalp bose - einstein condensation is satisfied as well .",
    "the fourth condition is that ulalps thermalize on a time scale shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "we call the time scale over which the momentum distribution of the ulalps changes completely as a result of their self - interactions the relaxation time @xmath25 .",
    "the relaxation rate is @xmath26 .",
    "ulalps certainly have gravitational self - interactions but perhaps also @xmath27 self - interactions .",
    "if thermalization occurs , it occurs in a regime where the energy dispersion @xmath28 is smaller than the relaxation rate @xmath29 . indeed , since eq .",
    "( [ momdis ] ) gives an upper limit on the momentum dispersion , we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 is necessary for thermalization to occur .",

    "the relaxation rate due to @xmath27 self - interactions is of order @xcite @xmath33 for qcd axions , @xmath34 .",
    "if we assume the same holds true for ulalps and furthermore that @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 thus we find that , like qcd axions , the ulalps may briefly thermalize through their @xmath27 self - interactions when they are first produced by vacuum realignment in the early universe but that they will at any rate stop doing so shortly thereafter .    in the condensed regime ,",
    "the relaxation rate due to gravitational self - interactions is of order @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the correlation length . since eq .",
    "( [ momdis ] ) gives an upper limit on the momentum dispersion , and we assume that ulalps constitute most of the dark matter , we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "we used the friedmann equation to relate the total density @xmath41 to the hubble constant .",
    "equation ( [ ggoh ] ) shows that , independently of the ulalp mass , the ulalp fluid thermalizes by gravitational self - interactions at the time of equality , or earlier if the ulalp field was homogenized by inflation .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that qcd axions that are about to fall into a galactic halo thermalize sufficiently fast by gravitational self - interactions that they almost all go the lowest energy state available to them consistent with the total angular momentum they acquired from tidal torquing by galactic neighbors .",
    "that lowest energy state is one of rigid rotation on the turnaround sphere .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this redistribution of angular momentum among infalling dark matter axions explains precisely and in all respects the properties of caustic rings of dark matter for which observational evidence had been found earlier .",
    "the observational evidence for caustic rings of dark matter in the milky way and other isolated disk galaxies is summarized in ref .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this redistribution of angular momentum solves the galactic angular momentum problem , which is the tendency of cold dark matter , in numerical simulations of structure formation , to be too concentrated at galactic centers .",
    "the fact that bose - einstein condensation of the dark matter particles explains the observational evidence for caustic rings and solves the galactic angular momentum problem and the fact that bose - einstein condensation is a property of dark matter axions but not of the other dark matter candidates , constitute an argument that the dark matter is axions , at least in part @xcite .",
    "although these studies @xcite were motivated primarily by qcd axions , they do not depend in an essential way on the axion mass and apply equally well to any axionlike dark matter candidate produced by the vacuum realignment mechanism , including ulalps . to summarize ,",
    "if ulalps are the dark matter , they thermalize by gravitational interactions and form a bose - einstein condensate at or before the time of equality between matter and radiation .",
    "they thermalize sufficiently fast before falling onto galactic halos to acquire quasirigid rotation on the turnaround sphere .",
    "they then form caustic rings with properties that are in accord with observations .",
    "the observational evidence for caustic rings therefore supports the hypothesis that the dark matter is ulalps but also , as we will see , constrains that hypothesis .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite on ulalp relaxation in gravitationally bound objects .",
    "we will show that the relaxation rate obtained there is consistent with the earlier results on axion relaxation in refs . @xcite .",
    "the relaxation rate in the particle kinetic regime is @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the particle density , @xmath44 is the scattering cross section , @xmath45 is the velocity dispersion , and @xmath46 is the degeneracy ( i.e.,the average occupation number of those particle states that are occupied ) .",
    "the relevant cross - section for relaxation by gravitational interactions in the particle kinetic regime is @xcite @xmath47 the average quantum degeneracy is @xmath48 combining eqs .",
    "( [ pkrr ] - [ aqd ] ) gives the relaxation rate by gravitational interactions in the particle kinetic regime @xmath49 for the special case of a gravitationally bound object , the crossing time is of order @xmath50 and the size of the object is of order @xmath51 .",
    "the relaxation time is then of order @xmath52 ignoring the numerical prefactor , which is at any rate poorly known , this is the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite for gravitationally bound systems .",
    "_ consider several systems that may relax in the particle kinetic regime and find either that they do not relax or that relaxation has no observable consequences . whether the ulalp fluid relaxes or not is of paramount importance in determining its behavior because it does not obey classical field equations when it relaxes .",
    "we found earlier in this section , following the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the ulalp fluid does relax before it falls into galactic halos .",
    "it was our purpose in this paragraph to show that the general discussion of cosmic axion relaxation in ref .",
    "@xcite is consistent with both the relaxation rate for gravitationally bound objects given in ref . @xcite and our claim that the ulalp fluid relaxes before falling into galactic halos .",
    "provided no thermalization is occurring @xcite , ulalp dark matter is represented by a wave function solving the schrdinger - poisson equations .",
    "the wave function may be written in terms of a real amplitude @xmath53 and a phase @xmath54 : @xmath55 in the linear regime of the growth of density perturbations , before multistreaming occurs , eq .",

    "an attractive feature of the wave function description is that it readily accommodates multistreaming @xcite . in a region with two homogeneous cold",
    "dark matter flows , with densities @xmath62 and velocities @xmath63 , the wave function is @xmath64 the associated density is @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the interference term is important for ulalp dark matter because the correlation length @xmath68 is large ( since @xmath12 is small and @xmath69 is generally fixed by observation ) and gravity is long range . the gravitational field sourced by the interference term in eq .  ( [ 2flden ] ) is @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "it is the gravitational fields associated with the interference terms in the ulalp fluid density that cause the ulalp dark matter thermalization discussed in the previous section @xcite .",
    "an isolated galaxy such as our own milky way continually accretes surrounding dark matter .",
    "there are on earth two flows of dark matter falling in and out of the galaxy for the first time ( @xmath43 = 1 ) , two flows falling in and out for the second time ( @xmath43 = 2 ) , two flows falling in and out for the third time ( @xmath43 = 3 ) , and so forth .",
    "the total number of flows on earth is of order the age of the universe divided by the time it takes a particle initially at rest at our galactocentric distance to fall through the galaxy and reach the opposite side , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "the flows of particles that fell into the halo relatively recently ( @xmath73 ) have not been thermalized as a result of gravitational scattering off inhomogeneities in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "those flows and their associated caustics are a robust prediction @xcite of galactic halo formation with cold dark matter .    for @xmath73 ,",
    "the density of each flow is of order 2% or 3% @xcite of the total average dark matter density at our distance from the galactic center ; i.e. , each flow has density of order @xmath74 gr/@xmath75 .",
    "since the typical difference in velocities between pairs of flows is of order @xmath76 , the coherence lengths associated with the interference terms are of order @xmath77 and their correlation times are of order @xmath78 the gravitational fields sourced by the interference terms are of order @xmath79 a star in the galactic disk acquires from each pair of flows a velocity increment of order @xmath80 after a coherence time @xmath81 .",
    "the total velocity acquired by a star is the result of a random walk in its velocity space , and of order @xmath82 where @xmath83 yr is the age of the universe and @xmath84 is the number of flows with density @xmath85 .",
    "note that @xmath86 is not sharply sensitive to our assumption on the number of flows since @xmath85 and @xmath87 are inversely proportional to @xmath88 , whereas the number of flow pairs is proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "the thin disk of the milky way is made of stars with vertical velocity dispersion @xmath90 km / s@xmath91 .",
    "we obtain a lower bound on the ulalp mass @xmath92 by requiring @xmath93 . the result obtained here",
    "is broadly consistent with the discussion of the thickening of the galactic disk by ulalp dark matter in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that ulalp dark matter has an oscillating pressure / tension with angular frequency equal to twice the ulalp mass and that this oscillating pressure / tension , being a source of gravity in general relativity , has measurable effects .",
    "the idea presented here is similar but makes use of newtonian gravity and multistreaming instead .",
    "cold , collisionless dark matter lies in six - dimensional phase space on a thin three - dimensional hypersurface , the thickness of which is the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles .",
    "we refer to this hypersurface as the  phase space sheet \" . as dark matter particles fall in and out of a galactic gravitational potential well , their phase space sheet wraps up .",
    "locations where the phase space sheet folds back onto itself have large particle density in physical space @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . indeed , the phase space sheet is tangent to velocity space at the location of such folds , and therefore the physical space density diverges there in the limit of vanishing sheet thickness . for small velocity dispersion ,",
    "the physical density at the location of a fold is finite but very large .",
    "these locations of high density are called caustics .",
    "they are generically two - dimensional surfaces in physical space .",
    "the kinds of caustics that appear are classified by catastrophe theory .",
    "it was shown @xcite that galactic halos built up by the infall of cold collisionless dark matter have two sets of caustics , inner and outer .",
    "there is one inner and one outer caustic for each value of the integer @xmath43 introduced in the previous section .",
    "the catastrophe structure of the inner caustics depends on the angular momentum distribution of the infalling particles .",
    "if the velocity field of the infalling particles is dominated by net overall rotation ( @xmath94 ) , the inner caustics are closed tubes of which the cross section is a section of the elliptic umbilic ( @xmath95 ) catastrophe @xcite , called caustic rings for short .",
    "evidence for caustic rings of dark matter was derived from a variety of observations .",
    "the evidence is summarized in ref .",
    "the evidence is explained in all its aspects if the dark matter is axions or axionlike particles such as ulalps @xcite .",
    "the caustic ring model of the milky way halo was independently tested against observations in ref .",
    "recently , y. huang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found evidence for the second and third ( @xmath43 = 2,3 ) caustic rings in our galaxy from their measurement of the milky way rotation curve out to very large ( 100 kpc ) radii .",
    "caustic rings of dark matter produce sharp rises in galactic rotation curves @xcite .",
    "part of the observational evidence for caustic rings is that sharp rises appear in the milky way rotation curve @xcite at radii consistent with the predictions for caustic ring radii by the self - similar infall model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is a triangular feature in the iras map @xcite of the galactic plane of which position on the sky matches the position of the sharp rise in the milky way rotation attributed to the caustic ring ( @xmath96 ) nearest to us .",
    "the triangular feature appears in the direction of galactic coordinates @xmath97 = ( 80,0 ) .",
    "it is seen also in the recent planck observations @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : tri ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pana ] we show the panoramic view of the milky way provided by the iras @xmath98 observations .",
    "the triangular feature is clearly visible on the left - hand side of the image .",
    "it can be understood as the imprint of the nearby caustic ring of dark matter upon the gas and dust in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the sharpness of the triangular feature implies that its edges are not smoothed on distances larger than approximately 10 pc . because velocity dispersion smooths caustics , the sharpness of the triangular feature implies an upper limit of order 50 m / s @xcite on the velocity dispersion of the flow ( @xmath96 ) that produces the nearby caustic ring .",
    "as we show now , it also implies a lower limit on the mass of ulalp dark matter , because the wave description smooths caustics as well .",
    "consider the simple fold caustic that occurs at a caustic ring radius , where the particles that fall in along the galactic plane reach their distance of closest approach to the galactic center before falling back out . in the particle description ,",
    "the particles satisfy the equation of motion @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the distance to the galactic center and @xmath101 is the effective potential for radial motion , including the repulsive angular momentum barrier . in the neighborhood of the caustic ,",
    "the radial velocity of the particles is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the caustic ring radius .",
    "conservation of the number of particles implies that the density near the caustic is proportional to @xmath104 the density diverges therefore at @xmath105 as @xmath106 , which is the characteristic behavior of a simple fold caustic .",
