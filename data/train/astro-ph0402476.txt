    "in the hot interiors of massive stars , the equilibrium cno cycle converts most of the carbon and oxygen into nitrogen . through turbulent and rotational mixing ( maeder 1982 ) , or perhaps by stripping of the outer hydrogen - rich envelope by a stellar - wind , these nitrogen - rich ashes from the core",

    "@xmath0 carinae is surrounded by a complex aggregate of ionized gas condensations known collectively as the ` outer ejecta ' , the ` outer shell ' , or the ` outer condensations ' ( e.g. , walborn 1976 ; thackeray 1950 ; meaburn et al.1996 ) .",
    "since these ejecta are ionized , as opposed to mostly neutral and dusty like the homunculus , they provide a practical way to estimate the chemical abundances of some material recently ejected by @xmath0 carinae .",

    "thus , young fast ejecta may be plowing into older material .",
    "davidson et al .",
    "( 1982 , 1986 ) examined the uv and optical spectrum of the brightest condensation and the brightest x - ray source in the outer ejecta ( the ` s condensation ' ) and found it to be extremely nitrogen rich , being almost completely devoid of any oxygen or carbon lines .",

    "the 7@xmath3 long and 1@xmath45 wide slit aperture was oriented at position angle 310@xmath5 , and pointed at two different positions in the nebula around @xmath0 car as shown in figure 1 .",

    "sky conditions were photometric ; flux - calibration and telluric absorption correction ( at far - red wavelengths ) were accomplished using similar observations of the standard stars ltt-3218 and ltt-2415 , with airmass correction performed using the ctio extinction coefficients in iraf .",
    "we estimate that the absolute photometric accuracy of our spectroscopic data is roughly @xmath65 to 10% over most of the observed wavelength range , increasing to between 10 and 20% toward the blue end of the spectrum .",

    "various bright condensations corresponding to ejecta seen in figure 1  some with very high doppler shifts  could be seen superimposed on narrow emission lines from the carina nebula h  ii region ( and some faint narrow sky lines ) with constant velocity along the entire length of the slit .",
    "we subtracted this relatively smooth background emission by carefully fitting the spectrum on each side of each condensation and interpolating with a second - order polynomial , excluding the bright ejecta from the fit .",
    "a careful subtraction like this is critical for interpreting the extracted spectra , and our subtraction method is reliable excluding unresolved variations in the flux from the h  ii region on size scales of a few arcseconds .",

    "therefore , the [ o  iii ] upper limits listed in the tables are based upon a measured upper limit for [ o  iii ] @xmath84949 and a limit for [ o  iii ] @xmath85007 that is 3 times stronger .",
    "an upper limit for [ o  iii ] @xmath84363 is not given because the strong line near the expected wavelength is probably [ fe  ii ] @xmath84358 .",
    "the [ o  i ] lines at 6300 and 6364   are uncertain because they are blended with nearby lines like [ s  iii ] and si  ii , but the intensities of these lines are probably valid to within about 30% .",
    "we chose to identify the emission feature at 7325   as [ ca  ii ] instead of [ o  ii ] , due to the strength of [ ca  ii ] @xmath87291 .",

    "@xmath88617 is particularly strong , and is characteristic of dense shocks .    _",
    "s ridge_. material in the s ridge was probably ejected by the star at least several decades before the great eruption ( walborn et al .  1978 ; morse et al .",
    "comments made above regarding [ o  iii ] and [ o  i ] lines in the s condensation apply here as well . in addition , [ o  ii ] @xmath113727,3729 is somewhat uncertain because it is partially blended with the nearby hydrogen lines h13 and h14 , and again , the line at 7325   is probably [ ca  ii ] instead of [ o  ii ] . in general , the spectrum of the s ridge is similar to that of the s and es condensations ( dufour et al .",
    "1997 ) , except that hydrogen lines are relatively stronger here .",
    "it is perhaps interesting to note that for the s condensation , hydrogen lines were also relatively stronger than forbidden lines in the spectrum published by davidson et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , which was obtained with a larger aperture than we used for the s condensation .    _",
    "nn jet_. like the s condensation , the nn jet appears to be younger than the rest of the outer ejecta ; it probably originated in the great eruption ( morse et al .",
    "the spectrum of the nn jet is dominated by reflected light from @xmath0 carinae itself ( notice the continuum level in the nn jet spectrum in figures 2@xmath12 and 4 ) , indicating a high dust content in the nn jet , with a clear line - of - sight to the star .",
    "interestingly , there is little or no soft x - ray emission from the position of the nn jet in recent _ chandra _ images ( seward et al .",
    "2001 ; we return to this mysterious absence of x - ray emission later ) .",
    "some relatively weak and blueshifted intrinsic emission from ionized gas can be seen in the 2-d spectra ( figure 4 ) , apparently from the outer bow shock around the `` jet '' .",
    "this emission has strong nitrogen lines and a spectrum qualitatively similar to the s ridge , with little or no [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "however , the kinematics of the ionized gas are complicated , precluding the measurement of accurate line intensities in the low - resolution spectra presented here ( for instance , reflected h@xmath7 is blended with [ n  ii ] @xmath86583 ) .",
    "thus , the spectrum of the nn jet is not included in the discussion below . however , meaburn et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have already discussed the kinematics and emission properties of the nn jet in considerable detail ; their high - resolution spectra show that the nn jet is nitrogen rich , with [ n  ii ] @xmath86583 roughly 6 times stronger than h@xmath7 ( see also dufour et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "_ w condensation ( w2)_. the w condensation identified by walborn ( 1976 ) was not included in either slit position , but a nearby feature that we call `` w2 '' was included in the northeast slit position ( see figure 1 ) . the blob is faint and the observed spectrum is noisy , but it is useful because it shows the relative strengths of [ o  iii ] @xmath114949,5007 , [ n  ii ] @xmath116548,6583 , and hydrogen lines at this position .",
    "[ o  iii ] @xmath84363 and [ s  iii ] @xmath86312 were too faint to measure , so only the [ n  ii ] electron temperature can be deduced here .",
    "this spectrum is complicated by multiple velocity components  the [ n  ii ] lines are clearly redshifted by @xmath13100 km s@xmath1 with respect to strong hydrogen and oxygen lines ( see the inset in figure 2@xmath14 , for example , and figure 4 ) .",
    "these two components may trace different parts of a shock ( see  4.2 ) , or perhaps a mixture of ejections .",
    "the redshifted emission is qualitatively similar to that of the e condensation .",
    "_ e condensation ( e5)_. one of our two slit positions passed through a few of the e condensations identified by walborn ( 1976 ) , of which e5 is the brightest ( see figure 1 ) . like the w condensation",
    ", the e condensation has several velocity components .",
    "the spectrum here is dominated by blueshifted gas at a few hundred km s@xmath1 , but there is both slower ( nearly rest wavelength ) and much faster material as well  see the discussions about kinematics in  4.2 and  4.3 .",
    "as in the w condensation , o lines arise in the slowest component .",
    "[ o  i ] @xmath86300 and [ s  iii ] @xmath86312 were blended , but appeared to have comparable intensities .",
    "the e condensation is part of the soft x - ray shell seen in chandra images ( see figure 3 ) .    _",
    "w edge_. the southwest slit passed through a thin filament at the western edge of @xmath0 car s outer ejecta , which has not been discussed before .",
    "this feature was visible in some emission lines in the raw 2-d spectra , and the background spectrum extrapolated from either side of the aperture marked in figure 1 was subtracted .",
    "the resulting spectrum is similar to the background h  ii region , except for stronger [ o  ii ] @xmath113727,3729 , an indication of a slow to moderate velocity shock in an ionized medium ( e.g. , see the discussion of hh  47d by morse et al .",
    "the radial velocity of the w edge is similar to the h  ii region to within @xmath650 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we identify the 7325   feature as the [ o  ii ] doublet instead of [ ca  ii ] , because [ ca  ii ] @xmath87291 is not detected .",
    "_ carina nebula_. the average spectrum of the background carina nebula was measured in 30@xmath15-wide extractions of bright areas on either side of @xmath0 car s outer ejecta ( the full slit aperture was roughly 7@xmath3 long ; much longer than shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "sky subtraction for these areas was performed by subtracting the spectrum in relatively dark areas of the nebula , like the dark patches of extinction in the keyhole nebula ( smith 2002 ; brooks et al .",
    "relative line intensities from the background nebula varied along the slit , but the spectrum in figure 2@xmath16 is a suitable average representing the h  ii region in @xmath0 car s vicinity .",
    "we used the observed balmer decrement in the adjacent carina nebula to determine the line - of - sight reddening toward @xmath0 carinae . using the extinction law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) and case b values for hydrogen line intensities computed by hummer & storey ( 1987 ) , the h@xmath9 and h@xmath17 lines in the carina nebula suggested @xmath180.2@xmath60.5 .",
    "this is lower than the average value of @xmath19=0.47 for o stars in the tr16 cluster , but it is reasonable given the observed range of 0.25 to 0.64 for those same stars ( walborn 1995 ) .",
    "this value is low compared to values adopted in previous studies of the s condensation ( 0.4 to 0.6 ; davidson et al.1986 ; dufour et al .",
    "1997 ) ; for this reason , we do not include the [ s  iii ] electron temperature in the analysis below , since it covers a fairly wide wavelength range and is more susceptible to errors from an uncertain reddening correction than the other @xmath20 diagnostics .",
    "( the [ s  iii ] lines yielded temperatures of 8,000 to 12,000 k. ) note that @xmath21 is not the usual value of @xmath223.1 ; dust clouds around the keyhole nebula near @xmath0 car suggest values closer to @xmath23 ( smith 2002 ; smith 1987 ) .",
    "although there may be variable extinction across @xmath0 car s environment , it is hard to characterize accurately with available data , so we used the same value of @xmath19 = 0.2 to correct line intensities for all the condensations ; dereddened intensities are listed in table 2 .",
    "although the h@xmath7/h@xmath9 ratio varies considerably ( as expected when collisions in shock waves enhance the h@xmath7/h@xmath9 ratio ; e.g. , chevalier & raymond 1978 ) , the resulting dereddened h@xmath17/h@xmath9 ratios are within 5 - 10% of the case b value , indicating that variable extinction is probably not severe . in any case",
    ", an incorrect @xmath19 would not undermine the main result of this study : the systematic change in o and n line strengths at various positions .      given the complex kinematics and the non - equilibrium shock physics that may dominate emission from @xmath0 car s outer ejecta , it is dangerous to place too much weight on a standard deductive nebular analysis .",
    "nevertheless , it is a place to start ; the results can guide inputs for future shock models and may be instructive and useful if we keep in mind that they apply to the average properties of the observed condensations .",
    "table 2 lists electron densities for various condensations derived from the [ s  ii ] @xmath86717/@xmath86731 ratio , and characteristic electron temperatures derived from the usual [ n  ii ] and [ o  iii ] line ratios .",
    "these were calculated using the temden task in iraf s nebular package ( see shaw & dufour 1994 ) . for the s condensation , which has already been studied extensively , our value of @xmath24 is somewhat lower than previous estimates , but @xmath25 is reasonably consistent with davidson et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and dufour et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , especially considering the variations in these quantities on small spatial scales within the s condensation itself ( dufour et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a clear trend is seen in figure 2 ; namely , from top to bottom , nitrogen lines weaken systematically as oxygen lines get stronger , and the characteristics of the spectra change from a rich shock spectrum to a photoionized h  ii region . since we do not have corresponding uv spectra for all observed features , and consequently",
    ", we lack information on critical ionization stages like n@xmath26 and higher , it is not immediately clear whether this trend is due to ionization or an abundance gradient .",
    "using the temperatures and densities in table 2 , some crude estimates of the n and o abundances are possible , however .",
    "ionic abundances for a few stages of n and o are given in table 2 , computed using the nebular package in iraf , as well as the relative nitrogen to oxygen ratio given by [ n@xmath27+n@xmath28/[o@xmath27+o@xmath29+o@xmath26 ] ( this is not the total n / o ratio , just a few observed ionization stages ) .",
    "we see that n / o changes from @xmath2220 in the s condensation to much lower values @xmath311 in the condensations farther from the star .    still , how can we be certain that we are not being misled by changes in ionization rather than chemical abundances ? indeed , there appears to be a pronounced ionization gradient in the outer ejecta : the ratio [ s  iii ] @xmath89069+@xmath89532 @xmath32 [ s  ii ] @xmath86717+@xmath86731 is a rough gauge of the ionization conditions in the gas which is emitting [ o  iii ] , [ o  ii ] , and [ n  ii ] , provided that the electron densities do not approach the [ s  ii ] critical density .",
    "( in table 2 , @xmath33 values for various regions are all @xmath3110@xmath34 @xmath35 , so it is unlikely that [ s  ii ] or [ o  ii ] @xmath113726,3729 are severely quenched . ) in the s condensation we measure [ s  iii]/[s  ii ] = 0.67 , and the ratio increases outward with values of 3.5 ( s ridge ) , 7.6 ( w cond .",
    "2 ) , 7.3 ( e cond .  5 ) , and 12 ( w edge ) .",
    "thus , there is an ionization gradient toward higher average ionization with distance from the star , regardless of whether the ionization is from shocks or photoionization . from spectroscopy of shocks in hh objects ( e.g. , hh  47d ; morse et al .",
    "1994 ) , the relative strength of [ o  i ] and [ o  iii ] lines are anticorrelated as a function of ionization , while [ o  ii ] remains fairly constant .",
    "thus , the oxygen depletion in the s condensation may be best noted by the lack of [ o  i ] @xmath86300 emission and very weak [ o  ii ] @xmath113726,3729 , in addition to the absence of [ o  iii ] @xmath85007 .",
    "previous study of the s condensation , including uv wavelengths that are not included here , showed strong lines of n@xmath36 , n@xmath37 , and n@xmath38 , but no strong oxygen lines of higher excitation ( davidson et al .",
    "1982 , 1986 ; dufour et al .",
    "1997 ) , and firmly established that the s condensation is indeed n - rich and severely depleted of o and c. by comparing our results for the s condensation , we can check the validity of our abundance analysis . in general , our n and o abundances are consistent with these earlier studies of the s condensation .",
    "for example , for the n abundance on a logarithmic scale with h=12 , we find [ ( n@xmath27+n@xmath29)/h]=8.6 , whereas dufour et al.(1997 ) find [ ( n@xmath29+n@xmath39+n@xmath40+n@xmath41)/h]=8.78 . similarly , we find [ ( o@xmath27+o@xmath29+o@xmath39)/h]=7.3 , and dufour et al .",
    "find [ ( o@xmath29+o@xmath39)/h]=7.06 . the agreement is good , considering the different ionization levels included and the difference in aperture sizes ( dufour et al .",
    "1997 used _",
    "data ) . in any case , despite potential uncertainties from calibration , reddening correction , or other systematic effects , it is clear from figure 2 that the w condensation , the e condensation , and the w edge are not severely depleted of oxygen , and it is likely that the observed variation in the n / o ratio from one condensation to another is a real effect of chemical abundances .",
    "our observations suggest inhomogeneous abundances in the outer ejecta of @xmath0 carinae . specifically , there is a strong change in the apparent n / o ratio : while ejecta immediately outside the homunculus are nitrogen rich and severely oxygen depleted , more distant material appears to have normal abundances .",
    "if it is indeed true , how shall we interpret this apparent chemical abundance gradient ?",
    "two different scenarios seem like obvious possibilities :    \\1 .",
    "dense condensations ejected by @xmath0 carinae over the past few thousand years may have become progressively more enriched with nitrogen and depleted of oxygen as ashes from the cno cycle appeared at the surface of the star , or as mass loss ate deeper into the processed material inside the star .",
    "all of the dense condensations that make up the outer ejecta may indeed be nitrogen rich ( perhaps in varying degrees ) , but the older material farther from the star may be interacting with the normal composition material deposited by previous stellar - wind mass loss .",
    "this would imply that @xmath0 car s outer ejecta are expanding into a cocoon or halo created by the loss of the star s original hydrogen - rich stellar envelope , as depicted in figure 5 .    observed kinematics may help distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "for example , proper motion measurements may be able to determine if the ejecta are expanding freely or are being decelerated , and ejecta with different chemical abundances may show discrepant doppler velocities .",
    "higher - quality data are needed for conclusive answers ( high - dispersion spectroscopy of oxygen lines might be particularly useful ) , but some more immediate clues are discussed below .",
    "proper - motion measurements in the s ridge ( walborn & blanco 1988 ; morse et al .",
    "2001 ) show a very large scatter in the projected velocities ( about 5 times larger than the homunculus ) , suggesting interactions between slower condensations and faster ejecta or a wind .      of the two possibilities listed above",
    ", the second appears to be supported more closely by the observations .",
    "a prominent soft x - ray shell surrounds @xmath0 car , and the shock heating of this shell arises as fast ejecta overtake slower material .",
    "figure 3 shows contours of the soft x - ray emission observed by _",
    "acis - i ( see seward et al .",
    "2001 ) , superposed on an optical [ n  ii ] image of the outer ejecta taken in june 1999 with _ hst_/wfpc2 .",
    "condensations that show relatively bright oxygen lines in their spectra in figure 2 ( e5 , w2 , w edge ) coincide with or lie outside the soft x - ray shell , whereas oxygen - poor ejecta ( s ridge , nn jet ) are inside it .",
    "the s condensation , s ridge , and nn jet may comprise an ` inner shell ' ( meaburn et al .",
    "1996 ) that may be distinct from more distant ejecta ( note , however , that the s condensation and nn jet appear to have been ejected in the great eruption , while the s ridge originated somewhat earlier ; morse et al .",
    "thus , if one wishes to estimate chemical abundances of @xmath0 car pertaining to its current evolutionary state , one must study the ionized ejecta of this ` inner shell ' which is not yet contaminated by swept - up material .",
    "examining long - slit spectra like the detail of [ n  ii ] and h@xmath7 lines shown in figure 4 provides some additional clues .",
    "while the background h  ii region emission has been subtracted carefully , figure 4 shows some faint h@xmath7 emission near the systemic velocity within @xmath2230@xmath15 of @xmath0 car .",
    "this implies that the outer ejecta are embedded in a cocoon or halo of h - rich material .",
    "even with a careful subtraction of the spectrum on either side of a given condensation like e5 , there is still some enhanced low - velocity h@xmath7 emission at the position of the condensation that contaminates the spectrum in figure 2 .",
    "this may indicate some low - velocity h - rich gas associated with the e5 condensation itself ; the oxygen lines in the e5 condensation also appear to have lower velocities than the nitrogen lines .",
    "obviously our analysis is hampered by low spectral resolution , so it is difficult to confirm any direct relation between kinematics and chemical abundances .",
    "however , meaburn et al . ( 1996 ) presented echelle spectra of h@xmath7 and the [ n  ii ] lines for several condensations and showed a clear trend : the [ n  ii]/h@xmath7 ratio was stronger in fast ejecta just outside the homunculus , and dropped by a factor of @xmath222 in the slower ejecta farther from the star .",
    "thus , even at high dispersion where line profiles are resolved , line intensities may be qualitatively consistent with an abundance gradient .",
    "figure 4@xmath42 also reveals some extremely fast nitrogen - rich ejecta not previously reported .",
    "at one slit position northeast of the star , we see blueshifted emission up to about @xmath433200 km s@xmath1 and redshifted emission as fast as @xmath442000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the extremely fast blueshifted material is faint , and was not seen in previous investigations ( meaburn et al .  1987 , 1993 , 1996 ;",
    "dufour 1989 ; weis et al .",
    "dufour ( 1989 ) detected a redshifted emission feature at @xmath442150 km s@xmath1 , but no blueshifted features faster than @xmath431000 km s@xmath1 were reported .",
    "the fastest blueshifted emission in figure 4@xmath42 is particularly interesting .",
    "first , this material is nitrogen - rich and the doppler shifts up to @xmath433200 km s@xmath1 are probably correct , since the two nitrogen lines and perhaps even h@xmath7 can be seen offset from one another by the expected amount ( these features are identified as `` efe '' for `` extremely fast ejecta '' in figure 4 ) . coincidentally ,",
    "this fast blueshifted emission extends spatially away from the homunculus as far as the position of the e condensation 5 ( roughly @xmath4325@xmath15 along the slit in figure 4 ) , where it seems to end abruptly .",
    "_ is this fast material colliding with the e condensation ?",
    "_ if so , there are interesting implications for the geometry .",
    "the e condensation 5 has a trajectory tilted out of the plane of the sky by @xmath45 , since it has a doppler shift of @xmath43140 km s@xmath1 ( meaburn et al .",
    "1996 ) and a tangential speed from proper motions of @xmath22600 km s@xmath1 ( walborn et al.1978 ) .",
    "if the same value of @xmath7 applies to the efe , the true space velocity away from @xmath0 car would be well above 10@xmath34 km s@xmath1 .",
    "such astonishingly high speeds would be unusual even for young supernova remnants ( e.g. , fesen et al .  1988 ) . though @xmath7 is uncertain , the true space velocity is likely to be well above 3200 km s@xmath1 , since the material is certainly not coming directly toward us  the fastest material",
    "is seen @xmath2225@xmath15 away from the star . _ with speeds well above 3200 km s@xmath1 , this is the fastest nebular material yet detected that is associated with @xmath0 car .",
    "_    could this ` efe ' signify a shock from the great eruption that is now causing the x - ray shell around @xmath0 car ? obviously , better spectroscopic data are desirable to constrain the age of this interesting fast ejecta .",
    "unfortunately , the proper motion of this emission can not be measured with existing _ hst _ data because it is doppler shifted out of narrow imaging filters centered on h@xmath7 or [ n  ii ] . regardless of the age",
    ", it is likely that this fast material was ejected by @xmath0 car itself ( i.e. the evolved primary in the putative binary system that was responsible for the great eruption ) , because it is nitrogen rich , with [ n  ii ] @xmath86548 @xmath32 h@xmath7 more than 6 .",
    "this indicates that under some circumstances , the primary star is indeed capable of ejecting material at speeds sufficient to account for the hard x - ray emission that varies with @xmath0 car s 5.5 year cycle ( pittard & corcoran 2002 ) .",
    "such high speeds are not seen in spectroscopy of the primary star s stellar wind , even at the poles where the outflow speed is highest ( smith et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "if this fast material is sweeping - out a cavity and causing the soft x - ray emission shell in figure 3 , it may help to explain why there is no significant x - ray emission coming from the nn jet and some other outer ejecta to the north and east of the homunculus ",
    "i.e. even though the nn jet is moving very fast , it is plowing through material that is already moving outward at high speed , so the relative shock velocity is insufficient for x - ray production , and instead shows a relatively low - ionization optical spectrum .",
    "this is analogous to the shock excitation in herbig - haro jets ( hartigan et al .",
    "1990 ; morse et al .",
    "1994 ) and may explain why we see [ n  ii ] emission even though the observed speeds imply that the shocked material should be non - radiative .",
    "we did not detect efe south of the star in the rc spec slit aperture offset to the southwest of @xmath0 car .",
    "this absence is particularly interesting , since that position coincides with a distinct gap in the soft x - ray shell around @xmath0 car ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "finally , the ` efe ' in figure 4 may help explain the peculiar morphology of the e condensations ( see figs .  1 and 3 ) , which show teardrop - like shapes that sweep away from the central star .",
    "if the e condensations are dense knots that are being overtaken by a much faster and more tenuous outflowing wind or blast wave , their structure may arise from rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "the detailed structure in the e condensations resembles some rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the supernova remnant cas a , for example ( fesen et al .",
    "2001 ) , or simulations of wind - cloud interactions ( e.g. , klein et al .  1994 ) .",
    "note that the e condensations do coincide with a prominent feature in the soft x - ray shell ( figure 3 ) .      of the two possible scenarios to explain the observed n and o line intensities  chemical abundance gradients in the dense knots vs.modified abundances through swept - up material ",
    "the second seems more likely for reasons described above . in either case , however , the observed abundance gradient is significant , because it indicates that @xmath0 car s ejection of nitrogen - rich ashes of the cno cycle is a _ recent _ phenomenon , occurring in just the past few thousand years .",
    "( the oldest of the outer condensations measured by walborn et al .",
    "( 1978 ) have proper motions indicating ages of @xmath2210@xmath46 years . )",
    "we have discussed several interesting aspects of the observed kinematics , but the main conclusion of this paper is as follows :    _ our observations suggest that diffuse gas immediately outside the nitrogen - rich condensations seen in images of @xmath0 car  the material they are running into  has not been significantly processed through the cno burning cycle . _",
    "the surrounding cocoon of normal composition material that the outer ejecta are now plowing through ( see figure 5 ) probably corresponds to part of the star s original h - rich stellar envelope .",
    "lamers et al.(2001 ) have inferred a similar type of abundance gradient or rapid enrichment deduced from n / o ratios in a sample of other lbv nebulae . since the outer ejecta are so young ( @xmath3110@xmath46 years ) , this conjecture has interesting implications for stellar evolution theories for the most massive stars .",
    "for example , stellar evolution models for stars above 50 to 60 m@xmath47 predict that internal turbulent mixing timescales are shorter than mass - loss timescales on the main sequence ; a star with an initial mass of 120 m@xmath47 has a mixing timescale of only 1.6 myr compared to a mass - loss timescale of 2.4 myr , both of which are shorter than the time spent on the main sequence ( maeder 1982 ) .",
    "rotation tends to enhance the mixing ( maeder & meynet 2002 ; maeder 2002 ) , and there are indications that @xmath0 car has significant rotation ( smith et al .",
    "thus , we should expect the cores and envelopes of very massive stars to be well - mixed and to evolve quasi - homogeneously .    instead",
    ", our observations suggest that @xmath0 car s outer layers were blown off the star before turbulent mixing was able to transport nitrogen - rich cno products to the star s surface .",
    "this might imply that in very massive stars with initial masses above 100 m@xmath47 , the mass - loss timescale on the main sequence is shorter than the mixing timescale between the core and outer layers , shorter than the nuclear - burning timescale for the cno cycle ( e.g. , appenzeller 1970 ) , or that violent sporadic mass - loss events like @xmath0 car s great eruption play a central role in a very massive star s evolution off the main sequence .",
    "the cocoon around @xmath0 car may have been created during post - main sequence evolution immediately before its current tenure as an extreme luminous blue variable , consistent with the idea that @xmath0 car may be a rare example of a post - wnl type star ( walborn 1989 ; see also langer et al .  1994 ;",
    "crowther et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the apparent abundance variations we observe in @xmath0 car s outer ejecta provide grounds for interesting though inconclusive speculation regarding its current evolutionary state : is there a link between @xmath0 car s fundamental instability and the critical point in the star s evolution when cno products are first exposed at the surface ?",
    "are catastrophic mass - loss events like the great eruption responsible for removing the outer h - rich envelope to expose the cno ashes , or do they occur as a result of it ( i.e. from a change in opacity ) ? the great eruption ejected several solar masses of material from the star ( mitchell & robinson 1978 ; hackwell et al .",
    "1986 ; cox et al .  1995 ; smith et al .",
    "1998 , 2003b ) , and therefore removed a large fraction of the star s outer radius .",
    "for example , models by guzik et al .",
    "( 1999 ) predict extremely tenuous outer layers for a star like @xmath0 car , with 95% of the radius containing less than 1% of the total mass .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that the great eruption itself , or perhaps a previous similar event , may have been the trigger that first released the cno ashes from the star .",
    "walborn ( 1976 ) has already compared @xmath0 car s outer ejecta to the nitrogen - rich `` quasi stationary flocculi '' in the supernova remnant cas a ( baade & minkowski 1954 ; van den bergh 1971 ; chevalier & kirshner 1978 ; fesen et al .",
    "1987 , 2001 ) ; these existed in the presupernova circumstellar environment and were probably ejected shortly before the progenitor star finally exploded .",
    "the corresponding implications of the nitrogen - rich outer ejecta for @xmath0 car s evolutionary state and its near future are provocative .",
