    "topological excitations play an important role in modern physics .",
    "@xcite they come in various forms , such as cosmic strings , vortices in superfluids and superconductors , and domain walls in ferromagnets .",
    "the topological excitations on which we focus here are magnetic skyrmions .",
    "skyrmion - like configurations of the magnetization direction in ferromagnets have been considered in quantum hall ferromagnets @xcite and spinor bose - einstein condensates .",
    "@xcite more recently , there has been a surge of interest in ferromagnets with lack of inversion symmetry .",
    "the absence of such a symmetry leads , in combination with spin - orbit coupling , to the so - called dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteractions that favor skyrmion magnetic textures .",
    "@xcite this enhanced interest is in large part due to the discovery of skyrmion lattices in mnsi @xcite and other ferromagnets @xcite with bulk inversion asymmetry .",
    "moreover , it was subsequently shown that these magnetic textures can be manipulated with charge currents of extremely low densities , @xcite which leads to attractive possibilities for magnetic - memory applications .",
    "@xcite    in these latter experiments , the coupling between skyrmions and electric charge current is largely understood in terms of adiabatic effects in which the spin of the conduction electron adiabatically follows the magnetization texture . within this picture , the effect of charge current on the magnetization results from the so - called spin - transfer torques exerted by carrier spins on the magnetization .",
    "conversely , the magnetization influences the conduction electrons which leads to effective magnetic fields and the topological hall effect for static skyrmion textures , @xcite and effective electric fields for dynamic magnetic textures .",
    "@xcite however , this physical picture neglects intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , in that it assumes that spin - orbit coupling does not affect the dynamical interaction between magnetization and transport current . @xcite",
    "( spin - orbit coupling is , however , taken into account via the dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteractions that determine the equilibrium magnetic texture . )    in the systems on which we focus in this article , the inversion symmetry is broken by interfaces rather than in the bulk and intrinsic spin - orbit coupling is typically important .",
    "in particular , we have in mind layered magnetic systems with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) , @xcite such as , for example , pt / cofe / mgo and ta / cofe / mgo multilayers , that have taken the center stage in experiments on current - driven domain wall motion .",
    "@xcite the motivation for this work is twofold .",
    "first , recent experiments have shown evidence for dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteractions in experiments on domain - wall motion in these systems , @xcite opening up the possibility for studying skyrmions as well .",
    "furthermore , we argue that our theory for current - skyrmion coupling is controlled by powers of spin - orbit coupling ( via the expansion in magnetization gradients ) .",
    "this enables us to construct a phenomenological model for current - skyrmion interactions that takes into account spin - orbit coupling to lowest order and applies to generic quasi - two dimensional conducting ferromagnets with broken inversion symmetry perpendicular to the plane .",
    "this should be contrasted with understanding the coupling between domain walls and current in these systems , which is complicated because of the multitude of torques that can in principle exist , @xcite some with different possible microscopic origins .",
    "@xcite the theory for coupling of domain walls to current is , however , not straightforwardly controlled by integer powers of spin - orbit coupling . moreover , detailed microscopic evaluation of the current - induced torques , including all possible effects realistically , is very hard due to the complex nature of the materials involved and the interfaces between them .",
    "@xcite    the second motivation for studying current - skyrmion coupling is that skyrmions represent a model system for understanding the coupling of current to magnetization .",
    "in addition to current - skyrmion coupling , we study the dependence of skyrmion profile on relative strength of spin - orbit coupling ( via the dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteractions ) and magnetostatic energy .",
    "although the systems we have in mind are the pma materials discussed above , we note that our theory applies to current - driven skyrmion motion in any conducting ferromagnetic system with the above - mentioned inversion asymmetry such as ferromagnets on topological - insulator surfaces , that have attracted attention recently .",
    "@xcite    using our theory , we estimate typical skyrmion velocities and find that their order of magnitude is around @xmath0 m / s for a current density of @xmath1 a / m@xmath2 ( which is a typical current density for experiments on domain wall motion ) .",
    "below , we first discuss equilibrium skyrmion profiles .",
    "subsequently we study the influence of current on skyrmion motion , and the generation of current by moving skyrmions .",
    "we also discuss contributions to the resistivity that arise from current - skyrmion coupling , and , in particular , contributions to the hall resistivity on top of the contribution due to the topological hall effect .",
    "these extra contributions to the resistivity arise due to the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , and may be more important than the topological - hall contribution in the systems that are currently investigated experimentally .",
    "we start out by determining the magnetization texture of a single skyrmion . to second order in the magnetization direction , denoted by the unit vector @xmath3 ( which is a function of position @xmath4 in the plane ) , and gradients thereof",
    ", we have for the energy of the system that @xmath5=t_{\\rm fm } \\int d\\mathbf{x } \\left\\{-\\frac{j_s}{2 } { \\mathbf{\\omega}}\\cdot\\nabla^{2}{\\mathbf{\\omega}}+k(1-\\omega_z^2)\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left.\\frac{c}{2}\\left(\\hat{y}\\cdot\\left({\\mathbf{\\omega}}\\times\\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{\\omega}}}{\\partial x}\\right)-\\hat{x}\\cdot\\left({\\mathbf{\\omega}}\\times\\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{\\omega}}}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right ) \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.+\\mu_0 hm(1-\\omega_z)-\\mu_0 m{\\mathbf{\\omega}}\\cdot\\mathbf{h}_d \\rule{0mm}{5mm}\\right\\}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression , the thickness of the system in the direction perpendicular to the plane ( the @xmath6-direction ) is denoted by @xmath7 and the magnetization direction is assumed not to depend on @xmath6 ( note that @xmath8 is , however , a three - dimensional vector ) .",
    "furthermore , the first term corresponds to the exchange energy with spin stiffness @xmath9 and the second term to anisotropy , proportional to the constant @xmath10 .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteraction is determined by the constant @xmath11 . that it is indeed related to inversion asymetry in the @xmath6-direction is made more explicit by noting that the dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteractions can also be written as @xmath12 .",
    "the last two terms in the expression for the energy correspond to external field @xmath13 ( in the @xmath6-direction ) and dipolar field @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the permeability of vacuum and @xmath16 the saturation magnetization .",
    "the dipolar field obeys maxwell s equations , given by    @xmath17    to obtain skyrmion profiles we consider solutions with rotational symmetry around the @xmath6-axis .",
    "we write the position vector in cylindrical coordinates , such that @xmath18 , and we consider magnetic textures that are parametrized as follows : @xmath19 . here",
    ", the angle @xmath20 determines whether the skyrmion is  hedgehog \"- like ( @xmath21 ) , or vortex - like ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "a detailed treatment of the influence of the finite thickness of the film on the dipolar field and skyrmion size is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "see ref .",
    "for such a study . minimizing the energy yields the equation @xmath28 the energy contains two contributions related to the angle @xmath20 .",
    "the first is due to the dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteraction and favors @xmath21 .",
    "the second is due to the dipolar field and favors @xmath22 .",
    "we have numerically solved eq .",
    "for various values of @xmath20 and @xmath29 and evaluated the energy in eq .",
    "( which is rather insensitive to the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) for these solutions .",
    "we have found that for values of @xmath29 from zero up to @xmath32 , the value of @xmath20 that minimizes the energy is @xmath33 , whereas for larger @xmath29 the angle saturates to @xmath34 .",
    "we take the experimental values quoted by emori _",
    "@xcite for which @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . for these parameters we therefore have that @xmath21 . restricting ourselves to this experimental relevant case we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] various skyrmion profiles obtained by numerically solving eq .  ( [ difeq ] ) .",
    "we take the external field to point in the @xmath6-direction ( @xmath38 ) so that the magnetization at the skyrmion core points in the @xmath39-direction , i.e. , @xmath40 , whereas the magnetization points in the @xmath41-direction sufficiently far from the core .",
    "since the skyrmions are stabilized by the competition between dzyaloshinskii - moriyaand exchange interactions , the typical skyrmion size is on the order of @xmath42 .",
    "this is roughly @xmath0 nm for the experimental values quoted in ref .  .",
    "the fact that the scale of the skyrmion is set by the dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteractions allows for classification of torques that describe coupling between current and skyrmion by their order in spin - orbit interaction , provided this interaction is weak . introducing @xmath43 as the parameter that characterizes the strength of intrinsic spin - orbit coupling",
    ", we have that @xmath44 , so that for skyrmion profiles each magnetization gradient carries one power of @xmath43 . in hindsight",
    ", this implies that the first and third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energyfirst ] ) are both @xmath45 .",
    "since these determine the skyrmion texture , the energy thus takes into account all possible terms that determine the skyrmion profile to second order in spin - orbit coupling , and including magnetization - direction - dependent exchange interaction is not necessary .",
    "we now proceed by writing down symmetry - allowed current - induced torques and classify them according to their power in spin - orbit coupling .",
    "there exist two torques that are also allowed in fully rotation - invariant systems ( i.e. , system without inversion asymmetry in the @xmath6-direction ) , given by @xmath46 where the current density in the @xmath47-plane is denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "these are the conventional spin - transfer torques that are commonly used to describe current - driven magnetization dynamics without taking into account intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in current - magnetization interactions .",
    "@xcite for skyrmions these are @xmath49 because they are first order in magnetization gradients .",
    "the phenomenological parameter @xmath50 determines the relative strength of the reactive and dissipative contribution above that correspond to the first and second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sttconventional ] ) .",

    "hence , the term proportional to @xmath50 should be kept within our approximation .    there exist two symmetry - allowed torques that are not expressed in gradients of the magnetization but require intrinsic spin - orbit coupling to occur , @xcite and are thus @xmath49 .",
    "these are given by @xmath51~.\\ ] ] one possible interpretation of these torques is that the field - like term ( the first term on the right - hand side ) is due to a current - induced polarization that exerts a torque on the local moments , with the term proportional to @xmath52 the associated damping .",
    "@xcite alternatively , the second term on the right - hand side can be interpreted as a sloncewski - like torque @xcite due to absorption ( by the ferromagnet ) of a spin - hall - like spin current flowing in the @xmath6-direction in the normal - metal part of the multilayer with spin polarization in the direction @xmath53 , or as an intrinsic anti - damping torque .",
    "@xcite the first term is then the associated field - like component .",

    "( [ eq : sttskyrmions ] ) that @xmath89_\\alpha.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the above expression corresponds to the topological hall resistivity .",
    "this hall contribution is topological as its contribution per skyrmion is determined by the winding number defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : winding ] ) .",
    "the third term is an extra magnetic - texture - related contribution to the hall resistivity that arises due to spin - orbit coupling .",

    ", we note that  apart from the topological hall contribution  the above corrections to the resistivity are nonzero also for textures other than skyrmions , such as domain walls .",
    "also note that there are other contributions to the resistivity resulting from the magnetization , such as the anomalous hall resistivity , that are not included in @xmath90 .",

    "the terms proportional to @xmath95 and @xmath96 give , for zero skyrmion velocity @xmath88 a hall contribution to the current ( the contribution @xmath97 being the topological hall contribution , the other being the correction due to spin - orbit couping ) .",
    "once the skyrmion lattice depins , the hall current drops because the difference between longitudinal electron drift velocity and skyrmion velocity goes down . as a final remark",
    ", we note that the joule heating associated with the current excited by the dynamic skyrmion texture [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : currentduetotexture ] ) ] gives an additional channel for magnetization relaxation that can be quite large in the clean limit , as was pointed out in ref .  .",
    "this latter work did however not take into account intrinsic spin - orbit coupling effects on current - magnetization interactions .",
    "we have developed a phenomenological model for current - skyrmion interactions to first order in spin - orbit coupling , applicable to metallic ferromagnets with inversion asymmetry in one direction .",
    "in addition to adiabatic and non - adiabatic spin - transfer torques , this model takes into account field - like and slonczewski - like torques that result from the inversion - symmetry breaking in combination with intrinsic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the effects of these torques on skyrmion motion depend on the internal structure of the skyrmions that is determined by the angle @xmath20 ( this angle is zero for hedgehog - like skyrmions , and @xmath98 for vortex - like skyrmions ) .",
    "in particular , the direction of the current - induced forces on the skyrmions , with respect to the current direction , depend on this angle .",
    "this dependence could in principle be probed by studying systems with different strengths of dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteractions .",
    "we point out that the classification of current - induced torques by their order in intrinsic spin - orbit coupling is possible for skyrmions because their size is set by the spin - orbit interaction itself .",
    "( in principle , the spin - orbit coupling should be weak ; the strength of spin - orbit coupling can , to some extent , be tuned by doping with light elements or varying the composition of the non - magnetic alloy in the multilayer systems . )",
    "this implies that all factors involving magnetization gradients give rise to one power of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in addition to being intrinsically interesting , skyrmion textures in pma materials therefore also provide an important model system for comparing microscopic theories for current - induced torques in these systems with experiment .    to estimate a typical skyrmion velocity , we take parameters from emori _ et al .",

    "@xcite for typical values of the gilbert damping parameter @xmath114 this velocity is of the same order as domain - wall velocities reported for these systems .",
    "for the same parameters , we have that voltage drop @xmath115 per skyrmion is @xmath116 nv @xmath117 [ m / s ] .",
    "depending on the internal structure of the skyrmion , this voltage drop could be longitudinal to the direction of skyrmion motion ( @xmath21 ) , or transverse ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "as a side remark , we note that for moving domain walls in systems with @xmath118 a similar voltage drop ( longitudinal for nl walls , tranverse for bloch walls ) is expected .",
    "hence , this voltage could potentially be used to electrically detect the position and motion of skyrmions and domain walls .",
    "finally , we note that the experimental finding that the adiabatic spin - transfer torque is small ( @xmath119 @xcite ) implies that the topological hall effect signal is probably small in the materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy that are currently under investigation .",
    "the skyrmions we have considered in this paper could be metastable single skyrmions , nucleated , for example , by inhomogeneous spin current distributions or by current in the presence of inhomogeneities induced by intended edge defects .",
    "@xcite alternatively , they could be thermodynamically stable skyrmion lattices .",
    "the latter occur once the energy gain due to dzyaloshinskii - moriyainteractions is comparable to the energies associated with fields and anisotropy , @xcite i.e. , when @xmath120 .",
    "for the parameters reported in ref .",
    "we have that @xmath121 is of order one , so that the prospects of observing skyrmion lattices in these systems appear to be good .",
    "finally , we mention that intrinsic spin - orbit coupling also results in phase - space berry phases that affect semi - classical electron dynamics , as discussed for mnsi in ref .  .",
