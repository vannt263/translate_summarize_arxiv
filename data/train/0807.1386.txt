    "in principle , a crystal with perfect translational invariance is a macroscopic quantum systems with discrete phonon states at any temperature below melting or decomposition .",
    "however , for crystals containing o  h@xmath8o hydrogen bonds , there is a widely - spread dichotomy of interpretation for the so - called `` proton disorder '' , usually observed as a dynamical equilibrium between two sites , say @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for such systems ,",
    "semiclassical approaches are commonly used to rationalize proton correlation times measured with solid - state nmr and quasi - elastic neutron scattering ( qens ) @xcite .",
    "semiclassical protons are dimensionless particles , with definite positions and momentums , moving in a double - well coupled to an incoherent thermal bath .",
    "dynamics are rationalized with uncorrelated jumps over the barrier and `` incoherent tunneling '' through the barrier .",
    "in fact , these models describe a liquid - like surroundings and strong interaction with the thermal bath is supposed to lead to fast decoherence . by contrast ,",
    "diffraction and vibrational spectra provide unquestionable evidences that the translational invariance and the quantum nature of lattice dynamics are not destroyed by proton transfer .",
    "the crystal of potassium hydrogen carbonate , khco@xmath1 , is at variance with this dichotomy of interpretation @xcite .",
    "this crystal is composed of centrosymmetric hydrogen bonded dimers ( hco@xmath11 , separated by potassium ions . below @xmath12",
    "k , protons occupy sites corresponding to a unique configuration for dimers , say @xmath13 .",
    "between 150 and 300 k , protons are progressively transferred to the other centrosymmetric configuration @xmath14 , up to a population ratio @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast to semiclassical models , it has been observed that the sublattice of protons is a macroscopically entangled quantum object over the whole temperature range .",
    "quantum correlations outside any description offered by classical physics are evidenced with neutrons because the intensity diffracted by the sublattice is proportional to the total nuclear cross - section @xmath16 bn , instead of @xmath17 bn for uncorrelated protons .",
    "enhanced diffraction observed from cryogenic to room temperatures is consistent with a superposition of decoherence - free macroscopic states at thermal equilibrium and the correlation time measured with qens @xcite can be rationalized with quantum interferences @xcite .",
    "there are therefore consistent evidences that protons in the crystal field are not semiclassical particles possessing properties on their own right @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we examine whether the macroscopic entanglement is destroyed by the reversible structural phase transition at @xmath2 k @xcite .",
    "the population ratio @xmath18 increases discontinuously to @xmath19 and then remains a constant above @xmath3 .",
    "this transition , supposed to be of the order - disorder type @xcite , could be of great significance to experimental studies of the quantum - to - classical interface in the crystalline state .",
    "however , structural and dynamical models are still in debate and require further studies .",
    "we have therefore conducted extensive single - crystal neutron diffraction measurements in order to ( i ) determine the best structural model ; ( ii ) observe whether enhanced features due to quantum correlations survive or not above @xmath3 .",
    "the experiments presented below show that the structural transition does not destroy the macroscopic quantum behaviour of protons .",
    "it transpires that the transition occurs from one ordered structure to another ordered structure through a coherent quantum process preserving the translational invariance of the crystal .",

    "[ sec:2 ] , we determine the structure at 340 k , for the sake of comparison with previous models . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we examine the total differential cross - section measured over a large @xmath20-range , at the same temperature , which evidence the enhanced features of quantum correlations . the theoretical framework is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] and we calculate the differential cross - section of correlated protons in sec . [ sec:5 ] for comparison with observations . in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , macroscopic states are opposed to statistical disorder and we utilize raman spectroscopy to probe proton dynamics .",
    "we suggest that the crystal is in a pure state that can be represented by state vectors .",
    "the reversible structural transition has a very small enthalpy and the crystal retains its optical transparency @xcite . below @xmath3 , the crystal symmetry is @xmath4 with four indistinguishable khco@xmath1 entities in the unit cell @xcite .",
    "planar centrosymmetric dimers ( hco@xmath21)@xmath22 , with o@xmath8o distances of @xmath23  , are practically parallel to @xmath24 planes .",
    "they are alternately slightly tilted with respect to @xmath7 glide planes .",
    "kashida and yamamoto ( ky ) @xcite have measured x - ray diffraction across the transition .",
    "the unit cell parameters are very little affected , the symmetry above @xmath3 is @xmath0 and @xmath7 glide planes become mirror planes .",
    "these authors envisaged two structural models : ( i ) the `` displacive '' model based on reorientation of dimers whose symmetry changes from @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) to @xmath27 above @xmath3 ; ( ii ) the `` disorder '' model composed of split @xmath25 dimers , symmetric with respect to the mirror plane .",
    "this latter model was preferred by ky , but machida et al .",
    "@xcite preferred @xmath27 dimers to fit their neutron diffraction data .",
    "we have collected single - crystal neutron diffraction data with the four - circle diffractometer 5c2 at the orphe reactor ( laboratoire lon - brillouin ) @xcite . the twining - free crystal ( @xmath28 mm@xmath29 ) , previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite was loaded into an aluminum container heated at @xmath30 k. this temperature is sufficiently below decomposition ( @xmath31 k ) to avoid damage , and it is sufficiently high to marginalize critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with crystals @xcite .",
    "we confirm the monoclinic @xmath0 ( @xmath32 ) symmetry and previous unit cell parameters ( table [ tab:1 ] ) @xcite . both structural models , referred to as `` @xmath27 '' and",
    "`` @xmath25 '' in table [ tab:1 ] , were refined .",
    "@xmath27 dimers are composed of four o@xmath33c@xmath33oh@xmath33 entities per unit cell , while @xmath25 dimers are obtained with four ( hco@xmath1)@xmath33 units .",
    "this latter model was refined in two steps .",

    "then , constraints were removed in order to check the stability .",
    "after further refinement , deviations were insignificant .",

    "[ fig:1 ] and table [ tab:1 ] ) , in accordance with ky , but at variance with machida et al .",
    "the @xmath14-factor is slightly improved by further splitting protons in two sub - sites on either sides of dimer planes , separated by @xmath34  .",
    "however , the large overlap of the thermal ellipsoids casts doubt on this splitting , so it is ignored in the remainder of this paper .",
    "positional and thermal parameters for heavy atoms in tables [ tab:2 ] and [ tab:3 ] are quite consistent , within estimated errors , with those of ky , but more accurate . by contrast , the proton positions of ky , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are at variance with those in table [ tab:2 ] and the x - ray based o  h bond length of 0.762(52 )",
    "  is too short .",
    "these discrepancies could arise from the difference between the maximum of the electronic and nucleus density . on the other hand , o  h bond lengths in table [ tab:4 ] are virtually identical to those of machida et al . for the @xmath27 model , and we have checked that the @xmath27 and @xmath25 models refined with our data lead to identical proton positions . furthermore , proton positions are identical to those previously reported at 14 k and 300 k @xcite , although with different occupancies .",
    "the phase transition can be featured as follows : ( i ) the discontinuous change of the occupancy of proton sites , with no significant change in positions ; ( ii ) small changes of k and o atom positions by @xmath37   parallel to @xmath38 ; ( iii ) the splitting of carbonate groups .",
    "the split carbon atoms separated by @xmath39   along ( @xmath40 ) can be distinguished , while the split oxygen atoms are practically indiscernible .",
    "the co single and double bond lengths ( 1.395 and 1.210  , respectively in table [ tab:4 ] ) are markedly different from one another and from those at 300 k ( 1.333 and 1.273  , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "in order to observe whether the enhanced features previously attributed to macroscopic entanglement survive above @xmath3 , we have conducted diffraction experiments with the sxd instrument at the isis pulsed neutron source @xcite .",
    "the twinning - free crystal previously measured at 300 k ( @xmath41 mm@xmath29 ) was loaded in a vacuum tank at @xmath30 k. it was shown that multiple scattering effects are negligible @xcite .    compared to the four - circle diffractometer , the advantage of sxd is twofold .",
    "firstly , with the high flux of epithermal neutrons at the spallation source , one can measure a more extended domain of reciprocal space than at a reactor source . secondly , with the time - of - flight technique , the total scattering function is measured at once and signals in addition to bragg peaks are effectively collected .    by definition ,",

    "these ridges are basically identical to those previously reported at 300 k or below for the ordered @xmath4 crystal @xcite .",
    "consequently , they are not due to transition induced phenomena , such as disorder , or domains , or planar faults , or critical behaviour , for which coherent diffuse scattering should vanish below @xmath3 @xcite . below it is shown that these features can be attributed to diffraction by the sublattice of entangled protons .",
    "within the framework of the born - oppenheimer approximation , the vibrational hamiltonian can be partitioned as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent the sublattices of protons ( h@xmath69 ) and heavy atoms , respectively , while @xmath70 couples the subsystems . for oh@xmath8o hydrogen bonds , coupling terms between oh and o@xmath8o degrees of freedom are rather large @xcite , and beyond the framework of the perturbation theory .",
    "two approaches , either semiclassical or quantum , are commonly envisaged .",
    "semiclassical protons are dimensionless particles , with definite positions and momentums , moving across a potential hypersurface @xcite . complex trajectories involving heavy atoms lead to mass renormalization , and to incoherent phonon - assisted tunnelling @xcite .",
    "this approach is quite natural when the born - oppenheimer surface is calculated from first principles , but quantum effects are severely underestimated .    alternatively ,",
    "if the classical concept of `` trajectory '' is abandoned , adiabatic separation of @xmath67 and @xmath68 may lead to tractable models @xcite .",
    "then , protons in a definite eigen state should remain in the same state in the course of time , while heavy atoms oscillate slowly , in an adiabatic hyperpotential depending on the proton state , through the coupling term .",
    "this separation is relevant for khco@xmath1 because adiabatic potentials for different protons states do not intersect each other .",
    "in fact , the separation is rigorously exact in the ground state , since protons should remain in this state for ever , if there is no external perturbation .",

    "irradiation by plane waves ( photons or neutrons ) may single out some excited states .",
    "entanglement in position and momentum is preserved , while the spin - symmetry and super - rigidity are destroyed .",
    "however , these features are reset automatically after decay to the ground state , presumably on the time - scale of proton dynamics .",
