    "the relativistic non - interacting fermi gas ( rfg ) is a rare example of a three - dimensional many - body system that can be solved while fully respecting lorentz covariance . when used in interpreting inclusive electron scattering at energies and momentum transfers that are not too small ( _ i.e. , _ at the scales set by the fermi momentum ) it leads to results that qualitatively account for the existing data . it thus seems natural to ask the question : for exclusive processes , _",
    "e.g. _ for the coincidence experiment ( @xmath3 ) , is the rfg able to account for experiment as well ?",
    "the answer to this question is clearly negative .",
    "one might then argue that the spectral function of the rfg , the key ingredient in obtaining the exclusive cross section in the framework of the plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , is severely out of touch with the physical world . yet when integrated over the energies and directions of the outgoing nucleons it leads to sensible results .",
    "in other words the rfg provides an acceptable first approximation to the particle - hole green s function , which is closely related to the inclusive cross section , but not to the single - particle propagator , which is closely related to the spectral function .",
    "of course , some of the failure of the rfg to explain such exclusive processes also , but clearly not only , arises from shortcomings shared with the pwia in dealing with the @xmath4 reaction through neglect of final - state interactions .",
    "in this work we limit our focus to kinematics where such effects are believed to be small and accordingly where the pwia should provide a good starting point .    with this as background ,",
    "let us now state the motivations for the present work : we explore within the framework of the pwia the connection between exclusive and inclusive em processes with the aim of    1 .",
    "deepening the understanding of the rfg model ; 2 .   assessing the impact of confinement effects for struck nucleons in a finite nucleus on the inclusive charge response function by exploring a specific hybrid model ( to be defined in detail later ) whose simple",
    ", tractable form facilitates taking the limit @xmath5 ; 3 .   providing a link between finite and infinite fermi systems in searching for a common _ model - independent _ factor to be used in defining a reduced charge response such as to have the coulomb sum rule fulfilled and 4 .",
    "exploring whether a modified rfg charge response can be worked out in such a way that , on the average , incorporates some of the properties of a confined system described in a mean - field framework .    to start with in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] and [ sect3 ] the kinematics of exclusive processes and the pwia are shortly revisited together with the definitions and basic properties of the scaling variable and spectral function . in sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] the inclusive cross sections and associated nuclear responses are obtained by suitably integrating over the exclusive processes .",
    "in particular we pay attention to the problem of fixing a dividing factor to yield a reduced longitudinal response for a finite system such that it obeys the coulomb sum rule .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sect5 ] , we examine in some depth the rfg , including the associated spectral function and its support in the plane of the momentum and excitation energy of the daughter nucleus ( often referred to as `` missing momentum '' and `` missing energy '' , respectively ) . in particular , by integrating the exclusive process over the variables of the outgoing nucleon , we recover the well - known expression for the inclusive cross section of the rfg .",
    "this we achieve for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the three - momentum transfer and @xmath8 the fermi momentum ) , but not for @xmath9 where pauli correlations play a role .",
    "indeed the pwia ignores all correlations between the outgoing nucleon and the daughter nucleus , including those stemming from the fermion statistics .    in sec .",
    "[ sect6 ] we improve upon the spectral function of the rfg allowing the hole states to be bound by a harmonic oscillator potential , the particle states still being plane waves .",
    "thus we set up a simple , tractable hybrid model ( hm ) to guide us in exploring the connections between finite and infinite fermi systems .",
    "our goal here is not to undertake computations with the best mean - field wave functions ( which of course could be done using the ideas presented in this work ) , but to develop a model for the initial nuclear state where the nucleons are confined , on the one hand , and yet simply described , on the other .",
    "for such a model much of the analysis can be done analytically and it is feasible to consider very heavy nuclei : in sec .  [ sect6 ] we present results for closed major shell @xmath10 nuclei up to the ( hypothetical ) case @xmath11 .",
    "the harmonic oscillator hm represents an extreme when compared with the rfg in that the former has very strongly confined bound - state wave functions ( with gaussian tails rather than exponentials as would be the case when finite potentials are used ) , whereas the latter only involves plane waves .    in",
    "inter - comparing the two models we find that the fermi momentum @xmath8 of the rfg can not be adjusted to yield the correct root - mean - square momentum for each shell of a harmonic oscillator well of a given frequency @xmath12 . to achieve this a set of rfg ,",
    "each with its own @xmath8 , is needed .",
    "when dealing with inclusive processes , however , one global @xmath13 is usually selected to get the same response width as that produced in some other model such as the hm .",
    "these alternatives are also discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect6 ] .    in the same section",
    "we continue with an assessment of the impact on the longitudinal response of the finite size of the bound nuclear system in a mean field ",
    "pwia framework .",
    "we find that the positive separation energy ( but not the confinement ) of the nucleus induces a hardening of the longitudinal response with respect to the rfg result . on the basis of scaling arguments",
    "we quantify this energy shift through a simple , but useful expression for the difference between the hm and rfg energy - weighted sum rules .",
    "we search for a fermi momentum @xmath8 and for a shift of the excitation energy such as to account for the confinement and separation energy of the nucleons in the initial state when calculating the longitudinal response within the framework of the rfg model .",
    "we accomplish this by comparing the inclusive charge response of the hm and of the rfg together with their various moments ( the sum rule , mean excitation energy and variance ) .",
    "we succeed as well in solving the problem of finding a reduction factor for the charge response in a way that permits the single - nucleon physics to be factored out and the coulomb sum rule to be satisfied asymptotically . in this connection",
    "we extend a result found previously for the rfg .",
    "namely , the reduction factor devised for the rfg is valid as well for the hm with harmonic oscillator wave functions and , by extension , suggests that such a definition should prove to be useful for wide classes of mean - field potentials .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sect7 ] .",
    "in this section we consider exclusive ( semi - inclusive ) nuclear electron scattering where the final electron is detected in coincidence with an outgoing nucleon , as described by the diagram of fig .",

    "however , when @xmath7 is sufficiently large , the integration domain actually encompasses the whole region of the @xmath120 plane where the nuclear spectral function is appreciably different from zero .    to illustrate this point we define the quantities @xmath151    15.5 cm    0.5 cm    which are nothing but the boundaries @xmath152 evaluated for the minimum allowed value of @xmath60 , namely @xmath150 , and for @xmath60 on the light cone , respectively .",

    "the second general goal of the present work was to develop a simple , tractable model for the nuclear spectral function that incorporates the confinement of nucleons in the initial state .",

    "typically the value obtained falls below that extracted from experimental determinations using qe scattering by roughly 20% , and only for the innermost shells of very heavy nuclei is the standardly accepted nuclear matter fermi momentum reached .",
    "further comparisons of hm and rfg through reduced response functions and the resulting energy - weighted sum rules tell us that the global nature of the spectral functions is quite similar for the two models , although the detailed distribution in missing energy and missing momentum is not . as a consequence , while inclusive lepton scattering responses turn out to be similar , for exclusive scattering the models would yield radically different results , as expected . in particular",

    "the former proceeds from the on - shell single - nucleon current whereas the latter starts from off - shell prescriptions for the single - nucleon current , and yet , when the differing kinematics in the two models are correctly incorporated , the final results are almost indistinguishable .",
    "this bodes well for studies of scaling and energy - weighted moments for then the ( uncontrollable ) model dependence will be weak and it should suffice for models that are not too dissimilar from the hm to use @xmath339 .",
    "such a procedure has , for example , been followed in recent experimental re - analyses of the coulomb sum rule .",
    "the further understanding of the ewsr coming from the model - to - model comparisons made in the present work also suggest refinements . specifically , when examining the first moments of the hm and rfg we find that the responses are offset by @xmath330 . shifting the energy transfer by this amount yields the same first moment in the two models .",
    "furthermore , comparing the variances in the two models we find the need for a larger effective fermi momentum in the rfg to yield agreement with the hm result , which also produces a tendency in the right direction for agreement with experiment .",
    "we conclude from these model - to - model comparisons that , with an energy - shift and rescaled fermi momentum whose origins are now better understood than previously , an effective rfg response can be obtained whose first three energy - weighted moments agree quite well with the hm developed in this work .",
    "in the course of reaching this deeper understanding of the two models we have also sharpened our knowledge about the @xmath69-scaling , @xmath198-scaling , @xmath224-scaling and coulomb sum rule properties of quasielastic responses .",

    "<S> while incorporating specific classes of off - shellness for the struck nucleons , it is found that the reducing factor required is largely model - independent and , as such , yields a reduced response that is useful for extracting the coulomb sum rule from experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> finally , guided by the difference between the energy - weighted sum rules of the two models , a version of the relativistic fermi gas is devised which has the 0@xmath0 , 1@xmath1 and 2@xmath2 moments of the charge response which agree rather well with those of the hybrid model : this version thus incorporates _ a priori _ the binding and confinement effects of the stuck nucleons while retaining the simplicity of the original fermi gas .    # 1 # 1 # 1    = 1.4 </S>"
