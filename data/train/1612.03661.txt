    "in recent years , the spectroscopy of hadrons is living its renaissance period due to the discovery of many new particles .",
    "the study of the spectroscopy and internal structure of hadrons is one of the main problems in hadron physics .",
    "investigation of the properties of hadrons will give clear picture for understanding the dynamics of their excited states .",
    "the experimental study of the spectrum of excited baryons is one of the central elements of the physics programs of many accelerators . during last years",
    ", there have been made a remarkable progress to collect data on excited state hadrons at jlab , mit - bates , legs , mami , elsa , etc . in experiments , radial excitations of hadrons having the same quantum numbers as the ground states",
    "are discovered @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the properties of excited hadrons represent a formidable task due to the fact that they can interact with many hadrons and it leads to the difficulty in their identification . for studying the properties of ground state hadrons the qcd sum rule approach",
    "@xcite has occupied a special place and has been very successfull .",
    "it is based the on fundamental qcd lagrangian and all non - perturbative effects are parametrized in terms of quark and gluon condenstates . in this sense",
    ", there appears the following question .",
    "how successfull this method is for the study of the radially excited baryons which carries the same quantum numbers as the ground states ?",
    "in present letter we apply this method to study the excitations of decuplet baryons .",
    "it should be noted that the radial excitations of light - heavy mesons , the mass of first radial excitation of mesons and nucleon by using the least square method within the qcd sum rules method are analysed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , this method has been applied for estimation of the mass and residue of the first radial excitations of octet baryons in @xcite and it has been found that the method is very predictive for radial excitation of baryons as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : qcdsumrule ] , the mass sum rules for decuplet baryons including their first radial excitations are calculated . in section [ sec",
    ": num ] , the numerical analysis of the obtained sum rules are presented .",
    "last section is devoted to our summary and conclusions .",
    "in order to derive the two - point qcd sum rules required for obtaining the masses and residues of the radially excited decuplet baryons , we consider the following correlation function : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the interpolating current of the decuplet baryon and @xmath8 is its four momentum . the interpolating current of the decuplet baryons coupled to the ground and excited states with the same quantum number can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are color indices , @xmath11 is the charge conjugation operator and @xmath12 is the normalization constant .",
    "the light quark fields @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the normalization constant for different members of decuplet baryons are collected in table [ tab : quarkfield ] ( for details see for instance @xcite ] .",
    ".the value of the normalization constant @xmath12 and the quark fields @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 for the decuplet baryons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a quick glance at table [ tab : rdnumvalues ] leads to the following results :    * the values of the masses obtained for the radially excited @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons are in a good consistency with the experimentally well known @xmath16 and @xmath17 baryons masses .",
    "* our result on the mass of the radially excited @xmath2 baryon is in nice consistency with the experimentally observed @xmath4 state presented in pdg @xcite .",
    "the quantum numbers of this state is not established yet from the experiment .",
    "this consistency suggests that the @xmath4 state can be assigned as the first excited state of the ground state @xmath18 . * in @xmath3 ,",
    "our prediction for the excited state is also consistent with the mass of the experimentally observed ( but unkwown quantum numbers ) @xmath19 state within the errors .",
    "therefore our analyses show that the @xmath19 listed in the pdg @xcite at @xmath3 channel can be assigned as the first excited state of the ground state @xmath3 with quantum numbers @xmath20 .",
    "we have studied the radially excited baryons in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 channells and found the mass and residues of the corresponding first excited states in the framework of two - point qcd sum rules .",
    "first , we extracted the mass and residue of the ground state baryons by choosing an appropraite threshold from the obtained sum rules .",
    "we , then , used those values as inputs to obtain the mass and residue of the first excited state in each channels . our results for the ground states are in nice agreements with the experimental data and the existing theoretical predictions .",
    "in the case of excited states , our predictions for the mass of the excited @xmath0 and @xmath1 states are in good consistency with the experimentally known @xmath16 and @xmath17 states masses . in the case of excited @xmath2 and @xmath3 baryons ,",
    "our results lead that the experimentally poorely known @xmath4 and @xmath19 states can be assigned as the first excited states in @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels with @xmath20 .",
    "our results for the residues can be verified via different theoretical approaches .",
