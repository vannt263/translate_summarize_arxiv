    "optical lattices are tailored made to study strongly - correlated fermi systems , the stability of different phases and the effects of dimensionality in population - imbalan ced mixtures of different species of ultra cold gases under attractive interactions @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the fermi surfaces of each species are no longer aligned and cooper pairs have non - zero total momenta @xmath1 .",
    "such phases were first studied by fulde and ferrell ( ff ) @xcite , who used an order parameter that varies as a single plane wave , and by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite , who suggested that the order parameter is a superposition of two plane waves .",
    "the mean - field treatment of the fflo phase in a variety of systems , such as atomic fermi gases with population imbalance loaded in optical lattices kop1,kop , fg , machida , capone , kmf , kmf2 , shows that the fflo phase competes with a number of other phases , such as the sarma ( @xmath2 ) states @xcite , but in some regions of momentum space the fflo phase is more stable as it provides the minimum of the mean - field expression of the helmholtz free energy .",
    "in addition , recent calculations on the fflo phase of the same system in two- and three - dimensional@xcite optical lattices suggest that the region of stability of this phase as a function of polarization increases when the dimensionality of the periodic lattice is lowered .    in this work",
    ", we use a bethe - salpeter approach to obtain the collective excitations of the two - particle propagator of a polarized mixture of two hyperfine states @xmath3 and @xmath4 of a @xmath0 li atomic fermi gas with attractive interactions loaded in a quasi one - dimensional optical lattice described by a single - band hubbard hamiltonian .",

    "in addition , the mixed phase or phase separation regime in which an unpolarized bcs core and a polarized normal fluid ( in momentum space ) coexist at very low temperatures and moderate polarizations @xcite is no longer present in this system in contrast to the 3d system ( and to a lesser extent in the 2d optical lattice ) .",

    ", we replace the single - particle excitations with those obtained by diagonalizing the hartree - fock ( hf ) hamiltonian while the collective modes are obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation in which the single - particle green s functions are calculated in the hf approximation , and the bs kernel is obtained by summing ladder and bubble diagrams@xcite .",
