    "like the sun , low - mass stars experience mass loss through winds during their entire lives .",
    "although the solar wind can be probed in situ , the existence of winds on low - mass stars is known indirectly , e.g. , from the observed rotational evolution of stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "measuring the wind rates @xmath5 of cool , low - mass stars is not usually an easy task though .",
    "although in their youth , when the stars are still surrounded by accretion discs , their winds have been detected @xcite , this is no longer the case after their accretion discs dissipate .",
    "the belief is that , from the dissipation of the disc onwards , winds of low - mass stars are no longer as dense , making it more difficult to detect them directly .",
    "there have been several attempts to detect radio free - free thermal emission from the winds of low - mass stars .",
    "the lack of detection means that only upper limits in @xmath5 can be derived . detecting x - ray emission generated when ionised",
    "wind particles exchange charges with neutral atoms of the interstellar medium has also been considered , but again only upper limits on @xmath5 could be derived @xcite .",
    "other methods , involving the detection of coronal radio flares @xcite or the accretion of wind material from a cool , main - sequence component to a white dwarf component @xcite , have also been suggested .",
    "however , the indirect method of @xcite has been the most successful one , enabling estimates of @xmath5 for about a dozen dwarf stars .",
    "this method assumes that the observed excess absorption in the blue wing of the hi lyman-@xmath8 line is caused by the hydrogen wall that forms when the stellar wind interacts with the interstellar medium .",
    "unfortunately , this method requires high - resolution uv spectroscopy , low hi - column density along the line - of - sight and a suitable viewing angle of the system @xcite , making it difficult to estimate @xmath5 for a large number of stars .",
    "@xcite showed that , for dwarf stars , there seems to be a relationship between the mass - loss rate per unit surface area @xmath9 and the x - ray flux @xmath6 , for stars with @xmath10  erg  @xmath2s@xmath3 @xmath11 because stars , as they age , rotate more slowly and because their activity decreases with rotation , x - ray fluxes also decay with age .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath6 relation implies that stars that are younger and have larger @xmath6 , should also have higher @xmath5 .",
    "this , consequently , can have important effects on the early evolution of planetary systems .",
    "for example , extrapolations using eq .",
    "( [ eq.wood ] ) suggest that the 700  myr - sun would have had @xmath5 that is @xmath12 times larger than the current solar mass - loss rate @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , this can explain the loss of the martian atmosphere as due to erosion caused by the stronger wind of the young sun @xcite .",
    "however , more active stars with @xmath14  erg  @xmath2s@xmath3 do not obey eq .",
    "( [ eq.wood ] )  their derived @xmath5 are several orders of magnitude smaller than what eq .",
    "( [ eq.wood ] ) predicts @xcite .",
    "what could cause the change in wind characteristics at @xmath15  erg  @xmath2s@xmath3 ?",
    "@xcite hypothesised that the stars to the right of the `` wind dividing line '' ( wdl ; i.e. , with @xmath14  erg  @xmath2s@xmath3 ) have a concentration of spots at high latitudes , as recognised in doppler imaging studies , which could influence the magnetic field geometry of the star .",
    "they argue that these objects might possess a strong dipole component ( or strong toroidal fields , @xcite ) `` that could envelope the entire star and inhibit stellar outflows '' .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the hypothesis that solar - type stars to the right of the wdl should have a distinct magnetic field topology compared to the stars to the left of the wdl .",
    "for that , we select stars in wood et al s sample that have large - scale surface magnetic fields previously reconstructed through zeeman - doppler imaging ( zdi ) . in our analysis , only the large - scale surface fields are considered and we can not assess if something happening at a smaller magnetic scale can affect the @xmath5  @xmath6 relation .",
    "our sample consists of 7 objects ( table  [ table1 ] ) out of 12 dwarf stars ( not considering the sun ) in wood et al s sample .",
    ".properties of the stars considered in this work .",
    "rotation periods @xmath16 were derived in the associated zdi work ( references in table  [ table2 ] ) , while the remaining values are from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath6 , @xmath5 and the magnetic maps are not necessarily derived at the same observational epoch . [",
