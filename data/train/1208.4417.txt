    "the opacity observed blueward of rest frame in the spectra of distant quasars rises toward higher redshifts ( @xcite ) , indicating the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is small but increasing with lookback time .",
    "this observation , coupled with the thomson optical depth measured from cosmic microwave background data ( @xcite ) , suggests that an extended epoch of hydrogen reionisation was ending by @xmath8 .",
    "reaching further into the epoch of reionisation  when intergalactic hydrogen is still substantially neutral  is difficult , but selected galaxies may offer one promising route to probing somewhat deeper into this distant era ( @xcite ) .",
    "the increasing content in the igm at @xmath9 produces a damping wing which can extend redward of a galaxy s emission line .",
    "the damping wing reduces the visibility of the emission ( @xcite ) , and the number of emitting galaxies ( laes ) observed in flux - limited surveys will thus decrease as the ambient fraction rises with increasing redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resonant nature of the transmission unfortunately complicates this simple picture .",
    "source clustering ( @xcite ) , dust ( @xcite ) , and resonant scattering within the sources themselves  which is sensitive to both the content and gas velocities ( @xcite )  all impact on the visibility of emission . the complex resonant radiative transfer within the galaxies often leads to substantial line redshifts of several hundred @xmath10 which can significantly enhance the visibility of laes when the surrounding igm is still substantially neutral ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , however , a significant decrease in the transmission of photons from high redshift galaxies has been found between @xmath0@xmath1 , ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result is based on the rapid decline in the fraction of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) which exhibit emission  a quantity which is ( in principle ) less susceptible than the lae luminosity function ( e.g. @xcite ) to observational selection effects and intrinsic evolution in the lae population . based on comparisons to existing numerical simulations and semi - numerical models of reionisation , the reported rapid decrease in the transmission of emission at @xmath11",
    "may be interpreted as a rapid change in the volume - averaged neutral fraction ( by several tens of percent ) over a rather short redshift interval ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a rapid change in the neutral fraction is , however , at odds with the rather low ionising emissivity suggested by the forest data at @xmath12@xmath13 ( @xcite ) which appears to imply a much slower evolution of the neutral fraction .",
    "theoretical reionisation models matching the forest data ( e.g. @xcite ) therefore have considerable difficulty in explaining the rather large neutral fractions ( @xmath14@xmath6 per cent ) that have been inferred from the recent lae / lbg observations at @xmath4 .",
    "alternative explanations which  either individually or in combination  might allow for a more modest change in the igm neutral fraction include an increase in the escape fraction of ionising photons , or an increase in the interstellar dust content of the galaxies toward higher redshift ( see @xcite for further discussion of these points ) .    in this paper",
    ", we shall argue that one other clue to this puzzle is provided by the quasar ulas j1120@xmath30641 at @xmath2 , recently discovered by the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of ulas j1120@xmath30641 exhibits a strong damping wing extending redward of the quasar emission line ( @xcite )  exactly what is needed to suppress the generally redshifted ( relative to the systemic redshift of the galaxy ) emission of laes .",
    "theoretical models predict that the regions surrounding rare , bright quasars are amongst the first to reionise ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the environment around ulas j1120@xmath30641 is typical of quasar host galaxies at @xmath15 , the significantly weaker ionising radiation field expected around even the brightest laes implies the impact of the red damping wing on lae visibility should be even stronger .",
    "@xcite used high resolution simulations of absorption to demonstrate that unless a proximate damped absorber lies within @xmath16 of the quasar , a volume averaged fraction of at least @xmath17 is required to reproduce the damping wing observed around ulas j1120@xmath30641 . in this work",
    "we show that an fraction of around 10 per cent could also explain the rapid evolution of the laes  obviating the need for fractions as large as @xmath5@xmath6 per cent .",
    "the difference in the inferred neutral fraction is due to the inclusion of small - scale ( @xmath18 ) , optically thick absorptions systems which remain unresolved in large - scale ( @xmath19 ) reionisation simulations . on including these systems the opacity up to a few hundred @xmath10 redward of rest frame rises more rapidly with fraction than usually predicted .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , this is because the intervening opacity of the igm at the end of hydrogen reionisation is strongly affected by the increasing size of these systems , which naturally occurs as the metagalactic photo - ionisation rate decreases .",
    "a more modest neutral fraction of @xmath20 per cent is much easier to reconcile with the fact that quasar absorption spectra at @xmath21 appear to indicate that the igm is highly ionised only @xmath22 later ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "we begin our analysis in section 2 , where we describe our modelling of the igm opacity and the procedure we adopt for incorporating self - shielded gas into a hydrodynamical simulation . in section 3 the properties of the optically thick absorbers in the simulations are discussed in more detail .",
    "we explore the implications of these absorption systems for the visibility of emission from galaxies in section 4 , and in section 5 we conclude .",
    "we assume the cosmological parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and a helium mass fraction of @xmath27 throughout . comoving and proper distances",
    "are denoted by using the prefixes `` c '' and `` p '' , respectively .",
    "we model the igm using a high - resolution hydrodynamical simulation performed with the parallel tree - sph code gadget-3 , last described in @xcite .",
    "the simulation employs a box size of @xmath28 cmpc , a gas particle mass of @xmath29 and a gravitational softening length of @xmath30 .",
    "the gas is reionised instantaneously by a uniform , optically thin ionising background at @xmath31 based on the @xcite galaxies and quasars emission model .",
    "although we subsequently recompute the ionisation state of the gas , this means the igm density field at @xmath32 is already jeans smoothed by the increased gas pressure following photo - heating ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this simulation was previously used to model the opacity in the near - zone of the high - redshift quasar ulas j1120@xmath30641 at @xmath2 ( @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we use an output at @xmath33 .",
    "the initial equilibrium ionisation state of the gas is set by a spatially uniform ionising background .",
    "we do not model the patchy ionisation state of the igm by following the radiative transfer of ionising photons emitted by individual sources .",
    "we will , however , estimate the effect of a central source on the ionisation state of the igm later in our analysis . a box size of @xmath28 cmpc is in any case too small to correctly capture the large scale topology of the reionisation process",
    ". instead , the high mass resolution of the simulation allows us to incorporate the small - scale structures responsible for optically thick absorption systems .",
    "these absorption systems are expected to define the edge of ionised bubbles ( @xcite ) , regulate the mean free path at overlap ( @xcite ) and delay the latter stages of reionisation ( @xcite ) .",
    "these systems remain unresolved in most large - scale reionisation simulations ( but see @xcite for recent `` semi - numerical '' approaches , and @xcite for smaller simulations which resolve self - shielded systems ) and are therefore often not considered when estimating the impact of intergalactic absorption on the visibility of laes .      in order to include optically thick absorbers in our model , following @xcite we use a simple , physically motivated prescription to assign a density threshold above which gas remains self - shielded , which we briefly summarise here ( see also @xcite ) . assuming that the typical size of an absorber is the jeans scale and adopting the case - a recombination coefficient for ionised hydrogen ( @xcite ) , the overdensity at which an absorber begins to self - shield may be approximated as :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the background photo - ionisation rate , @xmath36 is the gas temperature , @xmath37 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath38 is the free electron fraction with respect to hydrogen .",
    "absorbers at this density threshold have a characteristic size    @xmath39    the fiducial values adopted for @xmath40 and @xmath37 correspond to a plasma of ionised hydrogen and singly ionised helium .",
    "note that helium is not expected to be doubly ionised until @xmath41 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "comparison to radiative transfer calculations indicate this simple prescription recovers the density at which intergalactic gas self - shields to within a factor of two at @xmath0 ( @xcite ) .    we shall consider four different values for the background photo - ionisation rate in this work : @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "these are summarised in table  [ tab : uvb ] along with the corresponding volume weighted fractions .",
    "this range is chosen so that the largest value is comparable to recent photo - ionisation rate measurements from the forest at @xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lowest value produces a volume averaged fraction of around ten per cent ( with @xmath44 ) , and thus approaches the regime where this self - shielding prescription ceases to provide an adequate description of the spatial distribution of in the igm .",

    "neutral hydrogen ( shaded white ) traces the densest parts of the cosmic - web , and fills a progressively larger fraction of the simulation volume as the amplitude of the ionising background is lowered .",
    "we use these neutral hydrogen distributions as the starting point for constructing mock absorption spectra .",
    "sight - lines are extracted parallel to the box boundaries in three directions around the 100 most massive dark matter haloes in the simulation at @xmath33 .",
    "these halo sight - lines are spliced together with sight - lines drawn randomly from the periodic volume to form a total of 300 continuous skewers through the density , peculiar velocity and temperature field of the hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "the skewers have a total length of @xmath45 , ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath47 around the halo position .",
    "the optical depth along each of the sight - lines is then computed following a standard procedure , see e.g. eq . ( 15 ) in @xcite . in the rest of our analysis",

    "for comparison , the red triangles display the results obtained for @xmath76 when ignoring self - shielding .",
    "absorbers with the same @xmath77 have larger fractions when self - shielding is included , implying these must correspond to regions of lower gas density relative to the optically thin case . as we shall now demonstrate",
    ", it is this rapid increase in the incidence of optically thick absorption systems with increasing neutral fraction at the tail - end of reionisation which is primarily responsible for strengthening the red damping wing in our simulations .",
    "we now turn to the main result in this paper ; estimating the impact of the increasing incidence of optically thick absorbers on the visibility of laes . before proceeding further , however , we also allow for the possible effect of ionising radiation from a central source in our models ( i.e. the emitter under observation ) . ionising radiation from the lae itself can reduce the incidence of proximate self - shielded gas and",
    "therefore weaken the damping wing .",
    "we model the possible effect of the lae as follows .",
    "firstly , we compute the emission rate of ionising photons into the igm , @xmath78 $ ] , by an lae with observed luminosity @xmath79 assuming case - b recombination :    @xmath80    here the energy of a photon is @xmath81 , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the escape fractions of lyman continuum and photons into the igm . in this work",
    "we follow @xcite and assume @xmath84 , such that @xmath85 yields the luminosity uncorrected for dust .",
    "we adopt @xmath86 based on the typical luminosities measured in recent observations of @xmath4 laes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we assume a lyman continuum escape fraction of @xmath87 , which yields @xmath88 .",
    "the lyman continuum escape fraction is highly uncertain .",
    "a value @xmath89 per cent is required at @xmath90 if the observed lyman break galaxy population is to reproduce ionising background constraints from the forest ( @xcite ) , but as we will discuss in more detail in section  [ sec : cav ] the relation between emission and the escape of ionising radiation may not be straightforward .    in the models with a central ionising source",
    "we then assume the total photo - ionisation rate to be the sum of the lae contribution and the metagalactic background rate :    @xmath91    where we have assumed a power law spectral energy distribution for the ionising radiation from the lae , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that we have ignored ( i ) the finite lifetime of the lae , effectively assuming the ionising radiation propagates instantaneously along the line - of - sight ( ii ) the intervening opacity between self - shielded systems and ( iii ) assumed the lae luminosity is constant .",
    "all three assumptions will maximise the impact of ionising radiation from the lae on the surrounding neutral hydrogen . in what follows",
    "we therefore consider this as a limiting case and bracket other possibilities by additionally computing the damping wing when the lae is ignored .",
    "we do not explicitly account for the possible clustering of ionising sources around the lae in addition to the range of background photo - ionisation rates we already consider . as we shall demonstrate in the next section ,",
    "larger background photo - ionisation rates weaken the red damping wing by raising the density threshold at which gas self - shields .",
    "figure  [ fig : wings ] displays the median igm transmission profile obtained from the 300 simulated sight - lines ",
    "each panel corresponds to a different igm absorption model . note that when computing the transmission profiles we have ignored the contribution of all gas within @xmath94 pkpc of the centre of the lae host halo to both the lyman continuum and opacity .",
    "we do not model the complex radiative transfer within the host galaxy s interstellar medium , and account for the absorption by this material with the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 instead .",
    "the left panel shows the transmission profile predicted by our simulations without photo - ionisation by the lae .",
    "a strong damping wing profile is produced , even for photo - ionisation rates that correspond to fractions as low as @xmath95 per cent ( blue dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "this is due to the presence of high column density lls or damped absorption systems within @xmath96 pmpc of the lae host halo ( at @xmath97 ) . for comparison",
    ", the grey binned line in all panels displays the transmission profile of the @xmath2 quasar ulas j1120@xmath30641 ( @xcite ) ; a strong damping wing extends redwards of systemic despite the expected quasar proximity effect and the fact that the biased regions where bright quasars form should reionise earlier than on average .",
    "this implies that if similar ionisation conditions hold around bright laes at @xmath33 , an even stronger red damping wing may result .",
    "the central panel instead shows the damping wings for our models including ionising emission from an lae . the source dominates the total photo - ionisation rate ( i.e. produces more than 50 per cent of the total ) within @xmath98 .",
    "the incidence of proximate , self - shielded systems within this radius is therefore significantly reduced , and the damping wing is consequently weakened .",
    "on the other hand , recall that the typical halo mass in our simulations is rather small ( see section  [ sec : los ] ) .",
    "we therefore likely underestimate the abundance of proximate optically thick systems and this effect may be somewhat less important .",
    "the convergence of the transmission profiles at @xmath99 ( close to @xmath100 ) is due to peculiar velocities arising from gravitational infall around the haloes .",
    "we have verified that ignoring peculiar motions produces profiles which converge at @xmath101 instead .",
    "note that in the left panel of figure  [ fig : wings ] , where emission from a central lae is excluded , this convergence is less prominent .",
    "this is because absorption line cores from proximate absorbers in addition to the damping wing can extend redward of systemic ly@xmath102 ; this occurs more frequently as the photo - ionisation rate is lowered and the size of the absorbers increases .    at this point , it is important to emphasise that the transmission profiles also vary significantly between individual sight - lines ; a strong damping wing will occur whenever there are super - lls or damped absorbers lying close to the host halo .",
    "this can occur even when the igm is highly ionised ( i.e. for @xmath103 ) assuming a sufficiently overdense region lies in close proximity to the lae .",
    "this variation can be seen clearly in figure  [ fig : scatter ] , which shows the 68 and 95 per cent bounds for the scatter around the median absorption profile for @xmath104 ( upper panel ) and @xmath43 ( lower panel ) .",
    "some emitters will therefore be completely obscured by the damping wing while others will remain fully visible .",
    "the stochastic nature of the damping wing absorption from these high column density systems should therefore also impact on the clustering of laes ( e.g. @xcite ) for even relatively low fractions of @xmath105@xmath106 per cent , modifying the enhanced clustering signal expected as the igm fraction rises .",
    "this will be an interesting possibility to explore in future work .    .",
    "the short - dashed ( red ) and long - dashed ( blue ) curves bound 68 and 95 per cent of the transmission around the median ( black curves ) .",
    "note the median profiles are identical to those displayed in the central panel of figure  [ fig : wings].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in summary , it is clear optically thick absorbers can produce a rapid decline in the transmission of emission from high - redshift galaxies at the tail - end of reionisation .",
    "this is quite different to existing predictions using large - scale numerical and semi - analytical simulations of reionisation . in the late stages of reionisation",
    "the presence of self - shielded regions where hydrogen can recombine and stay neutral is very important ( @xcite ) .",
    "large - scale reionisation simulations do not yet have the dynamic range to resolve these systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "any neutral gas is thus typically far away from the central regions of regions , and the impact of nearby optically thick absorbers on the damping wing is ignored .",
    "we illustrate this in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : wings ] , where we have simulated the damping wing expected around a lae embedded in an bubble with radius @xmath107 . inside the bubble ( @xmath108 ) ,",
    "the igm is highly ionised with a uniform fraction of @xmath109 , while outside the igm is fully neutral .",
    "this simple model serves to illustrate the importance of optically thick absorbers for the red damping wing .",
    "bubble sizes of @xmath110 cmpc are required to produce a damping wing similar in strength to the absorption seen when the igm is only @xmath95 per cent neutral by volume ( blue dot - dashed curve in the central panel of figure  [ fig : wings ] ) when including optically thick absorbers . in comparison ,",
    "large scale reionisation simulations typically predict bubble sizes of @xmath111@xmath5 cmpc for fractions as large as 30 per cent ( e.g. figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this elucidates why existing models indicate the lae / lbg fraction at @xmath4 may imply large fractions of 40 - 90 per cent . at fixed neutral fraction ,",
    "large - scale reionisation simulations predict a damping wing which is significantly weaker compared to the case where absorption by optically thick absorbers is included . the damping wing will therefore only reduce lae visibility at times when individual bubbles have not yet grown to the typical size of @xmath112 cmpc reached at overlap in these simulations .",
    "we now compare our models directly to recent measurements of the lbg / lae fraction ( @xcite ) following the approach of @xcite , which we recapitulate here .",
    "our first requirement is to compute the fraction of the emission line which is transmitted , @xmath113 , where    @xmath114    here @xmath115 gives the shape of the line profile , @xmath116 is the igm transmission ( e.g. figure  [ fig : wings ] ) and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are chosen to correspond to the full extent of our simulated sight - lines . to compute @xmath113 for each of our simulated sight - lines we must assume an intrinsic profile .",
    "we adopt a gaussian line profile with a standard deviation of @xmath119 , corresponding to the circular velocity of a dark matter halo of mass @xmath120 at @xmath33 ( eq . 25 in @xcite ) .",
    "we further assume that the line centre is shifted redward of by @xmath121 ; this offset is typical of emission lines associated with lbgs at @xmath122 ( @xcite ) , and is chosen to mimic the effect of resonant scattering by the ( outflowing ) gas on the line visibility ( but see our discussion in the next section ) .",
    "we next construct a probability distribution @xmath123 for each igm absorption model using our simulations .",
    "for redshifted relative to systemic we assume the observed rest frame equivalent width ( rew ) at @xmath0 , when the hydrogen in universe is already highly ionised , to be equal to the emitted rew ( i.e. @xmath124 ) .",
    "if we further assume that there is no intrinsic evolution in the lae population from @xmath0 to @xmath33 , the cumulative probability distribution ( cpdf ) that a galaxy has an observed rew and an igm transmission @xmath125 at @xmath33 is    @xmath126    here @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rew ] displays the resulting cpdfs for the igm models with self - shielding only ( left panel ) and including ionisation by a central lae ( central panel ) .",
    "note again these two cases have been chosen to bracket the uncertain impact of lyman continuum emission from the central lae on the surrounding igm ( see also the discussion in section  [ sec : cav ] ) .",
    "the cpdfs are compared to a recent data compilation presented by @xcite , as well as an upper limit at @xmath130 from @xcite .",
    "all curves in the central panel lie above the quoted observational uncertainties , implying a lower line - of - sight escape fraction ( @xmath131 ) is required to match the data if the fraction remains fixed . as expected , however , our simulations do predict a rapid evolution in the rew distribution from @xmath0 , even for modest neutral fractions of @xmath105 per cent ( blue dot - dashed curve ) . in the right panel ,",
    "the cpdf for the @xmath132 model in the central panel ( orange long - dashed curve with @xmath133 ) is shown assuming four different offsets for the emission line relative to systemic .",
    "shifting the line blueward ( redward ) of the fiducial @xmath134 decreases ( increases ) @xmath135 , producing a stronger ( weaker ) evolution in the rew distribution .      from our discussion",
    "thus far , it should be clear that modelling the igm transmission for laes at the tail - end of reionisation is uncertain mainly because of the difficulties with self - consistently modelling self - shielded regions . however",
    ", uncertainties associated with the escape of ionising radiation from the ( possibly clustered ) emitters and the redshift relative to systemic of the emission also play a role .    when including an lae in our models we have assumed @xmath87 .",
    "it is , however , not obvious that high redshift galaxies emit ionising and radiation at the same time and/or in the same direction .",
    "it is certainly plausible that no ionising radiation escapes in the direction of the observer ( e.g. @xcite ) , in which case even our igm model excluding a central source ( i.e. the left panel in figure  [ fig : rew ] ) may actually be an overestimate of the igm transmission @xmath113 ; recall we have ignored all neutral gas within @xmath136 of the halo centre and instead assumed the appropriate escape fractions for ionising and photons .",
    "note further that the escape of ionising radiation and the emission redshift relative to systemic may also be unfavourably coupled .",
    "a large redshift for the emission line may need a large column density of neutral gas within the host halo of the lae .",
    "this is required in order to resonantly scatter the photons locally far into the red wing of the line ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the redshifts of @xmath137 or more for the observed emission in @xmath138 lbgs ( @xcite ) may therefore be incompatible with a simultaneous escape of ionising radiation along the line - of - sight to the observer .",
    "the detailed intrinsic line shape is also rather uncertain  in this work we have assumed a simple gaussian line profile with standard deviation @xmath119 . in practice , however , radiative transfer models predict a characteristic double peaked emission line ( e.g. @xcite ) with intergalactic absorption removing the blue peak at high redshift . in their recent analysis of the rew distribution predicted by large - scale reionisation simulations , @xcite",
    "adopt a doubled peaked gaussian minus a gaussian line based on the radiative transfer simulations presented by @xcite .",
    "they note that using this line profile weakens the impact of the fraction on the rew distribution compared to a simple gaussian centred at the systemic redshift .",
    "note , however , since we adopt a profile which is shifted redward of systemic , our assumption that the entire line is visible in the absence of a red damping wing is reasonable .",
    "unless the line width becomes comparable to the line offset relative to systemic , this will not have a significant effect on the resulting rew distribution .",
    "lastly , the small simulation box size of @xmath139 and the omission of self - consistent modelling for the ionising sources remains the most significant concern in this analysis .",
    "we do not correctly model large - scale variations in the igm ionisation state prior to overlap . on the other hand , we argue that the proper modelling of dense , self - shielded regions are an equally important part of this problem",
    ". a fully self - consistent model will require combining both of these aspects , either by resolving all relevant physical scales or adopting sub - grid models which are informed by high resolution simulations of the igm density field .",
    "furthermore , any modelling should be calibrated to reproduce the observed transmission redwards of in bright high - redshift quasars which appears to evolve rapidly between @xmath0@xmath1 ; the simulations presented here have been used to estimate a neutral fraction of @xmath140 per cent around the @xmath2 quasar ulas j1120@xmath30641 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , this is based on a small number of bright quasars at @xmath141 and only one at @xmath15 .",
    "future observations will help determine whether ulas j1120@xmath30641 is typical .",
    "we have used a hydrodynamical simulation to model the opacity of the intervening igm during the final stages of reionisation . as the photo - ionisation rate drops the opacity redward of rest - frame",
    "is expected to rise rapidly due to the increasing incidence of optically thick absorption systems .",
    "our results indicate that the bulk of the opacity will arise from optically thick systems with column densities @xmath142@xmath71 .",
    "when including these absorption systems in the simulations , only a moderate rise in the volume averaged neutral fraction is required to significantly reduce the transmission redward of rest - frame ly@xmath102 .",
    "this result has an important implication for the interpretation of the recently observed decline in the emission from high - redshift galaxies at @xmath143@xmath1 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we find that these observations do not require a large neutral fraction ( @xmath14@xmath6 per cent ) in the intervening igm at @xmath33 as previously suggested . instead ,",
    "if the rapid decline in the lae / lbg fraction is further corroborated , it may instead be indicative of the rapid decrease of the mean free path of ionising photons expected at the tail - end of reionisation .",
    "furthermore , as we find the emission from high - redshift galaxies will be suppressed for volume - averaged neutral fractions of only @xmath105@xmath106 per cent , the patchiness of reionisation may produce a more modest impact on the clustering properties of observable high - redshift laes than previously predicted .",
    "our findings may be particularly relevant for future surveys which plan to use the transmission of emission and the clustering properties of laes to probe deep into the epoch of reionisation .",
    "detecting these laes at @xmath15 may well become difficult , even when the igm is only ten per cent neutral .",
    "it may also mean that spectroscopic confirmation of high - redshift candidate galaxies identified with the drop - out technique at @xmath15 may become problematic , at least until emission lines other than can be observed with the james webb space telescope .",
    "finally , extending theoretical predictions beyond the approximate approach adopted in this work is vital .",
    "this will ultimately require incorporating small - scale absorption systems into simulations which also model the patchy nature of reionisation on large scales .",
    "this remains a considerable but fundamental computational challenge for the current generation of reionisation simulations .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulation used in this work was performed using the darwin supercomputer of the university of cambridge high performance computing service ( http://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/ ) , provided by dell inc . using strategic research infrastructure funding from the higher education funding council for england .",
