    "the experimental achievement that led to the bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , using dilute alkali gases at ultracold temperatures @xcite , induced a substantial effort dedicated to the understanding of new properties of becs .",
    "in particular , the development of the techniques used in the production and manipulation of ultracold atoms and molecules @xcite has opened the way to a new field , the `` chemistry '' of ultracold systems , i.e where the atomic constituents of the dilute gas may recombine forming molecules .",
    "such molecular bec compounds have been obtained by different techniques @xcite , for instance , by feshbach resonances @xcite or photoassociation @xcite .",
    "there can also occur atom - molecule interactions that must be at least three - body in nature @xcite , bringing up new stimulus and challenges to our physical understanding .",
    "experimental evidences for three - body recombinations @xcite as well as for efimov states @xcite provide a physical ground and stimulus for the search of triatomic molecular becs and for the investigation of their theoretical aspects , which is our main interest .",
    "> from the theoretical point of view , ultracold atomic and molecular systems are characterized by their large quantum fluctuations . in this sense , it becomes relevant the search for exactly solvable models describing atomic and molecular bec .",
    "indeed this has become a very active field of research @xcite , and the experimental relevance of these models is currently a very active research subject @xcite .",
    "those solvable models are expected to provide a significant impact in this area , a view that has been promoted in @xcite . increasing evidence and recent results",
    "show that multi - atomic systems may be interesting and relevant for ultracold atomic - molecular in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "a significant question in this context is whether more complex ultracold molecules could be created than simple dimers @xcite .",
    "also , due to the more sophisticated nature of the control of the interatomic interactions , in the case of triatomic molecules , one expects a rich quantum phase structure .",
    "indeed , very recent experimental results confirm the existence of heteroatomic bosonic trimers in ultracold mixtures @xcite which provide us with additional motivation to pursue the present investigation .    in this paper",
    "we analyze an integrable model describing a hetero - triatomic molecular bose - einstein condensate where atomic becs can combine ( in different proportions ) to produce a compound with two atoms of the same kind and a third one of a different species .",
    "our model , that has been shown to be solvable in @xcite , includes besides the interconversion of atoms to molecules and vice - versa , a linear interaction corresponding as the external potential and a bilinear interaction corresponding the scattering between atoms - atoms , atoms - molecules and molecules - molecules .",
    "we start our analysis of this model by a classical treatment where we obtain its phase space determining in particular the fixed points .",
    "we find that for certain coupling parameters bifurcation of the fixed points occurs , and we can determine a parameter space diagram which classifies the found fixed points .",
    "this diagram is determined for the imbalance of the number of atoms which allows us to classify it in three distinct cases .",
    "specifically , when the imbalance is equal zero or negative there is a spontaneous appearance of additional boundaries in the parameter space ( three for the zero case and two for the negative case ) , some of which can be identified with bifurcations of the minimum of the classical hamiltonian .",
    "we also perform a quantum analysis , where we study the quantum dynamics and compare with the classical results . here",
    "we are interested in studying the ground state of the model , because as actual systems are in ultracold temperature some insight can be obtained from the ground state .",
    "furthermore as pointed out before the presence of large quantum fluctuations make it interesting to look for the phase structure at zero temperature , the quantum phase transitions .",
    "in our case we are able to look for signatures of quantum phase transition . here",
    "we use two definitions , energy gap and ground state fidelity in order to find a quantum phase pre - transition , a term that will be explained later .",
    "we observe that the critical points are pinning down in completely agreement with the classical analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our integrable model .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the classical analysis where the parameter diagram are obtained .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the quantum analysis where we show the quantum dynamics and a study about quantum phase pre - transition .",
    "section 5 is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "let us consider the following hamiltonian describing a hetero - triatomic - molecular bose - einstein condensate with two identical species of atoms , denoted by @xmath0 which can be combined to a different type of atom , denoted by @xmath1 , to produce a molecule labelled by @xmath2 . in terms of canonical creation and annihilation operators",

    "the hamiltonian acts on the fock space spanned by the ( unnormalized ) vectors @xmath14    where @xmath15 is fock vacuum .",
    "the hamiltonian above has two independent conserved quantities @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total number of atoms and @xmath18 is the atomic imbalance .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath19 , as the fractional atomic imbalance .",
    "since there are three degrees of freedom and three conserved quantities , the model is integrable .",
    "more details about the integrability of this model , using the bethe ansatz method , can be found in @xcite . in what follows",

    "( [ fixed ] ) in a parameter diagram , dividing the parameter space into different regions , for each case of @xmath43 discussed above .",

    "this requirement determines the boundaries in the parameter space , which are depicted in fig . [",
    "fig:2](c ) for @xmath79 .",
    "as in the case of @xmath43 positive , we can determine the region boundaries in the parameter space for the other two cases .",
    "however , because of the existence of solutions of the form given by ( [ boundary1 ] ) , which do not have an analogue for positive @xmath43 , we see the appearance of new boundaries given by the conditions @xmath80 for negative @xmath43 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",

    "therefore , we have a different scenario for the parameter space diagram , depending if the fractional atomic imbalance @xmath43 is negative , zero or positive , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . basically , we can summarize the typical behaviour of the parameter space diagram as follows : when @xmath43 is negative , the parameter diagram is divided in five regions : in region a there is no solution for @xmath26 when @xmath54 and one solution for z when @xmath56 . in region",
    "b there are two solutions for @xmath26 when @xmath54 and one solution for @xmath26 when @xmath56 . in region",

    "e there is one solution for @xmath26 when @xmath54 and no solution for @xmath26 when @xmath56 . for the case @xmath88 ,",
    "region c disappears and the phase diagram is left with the four regions a , b , d , e discussed before .",
    "when @xmath43 is positive the diagram is divided in three regions : in region i there is one solution for @xmath26 when @xmath54 and one solution for @xmath26 when @xmath56 . in region",

    "iii there is one solution for @xmath26 when @xmath54 and three solutions for @xmath26 when @xmath56 .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the fractional atomic imbalance also plays an important role in hetero - diatomic molecular bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    to help visualize the classical dynamics , it is useful to plot the level curves of the hamiltonian ( [ hamc ] ) .",
    "since the fixed points change the topology of the level curves , qualitative differences can be observed between the different regions .",

    "[ lc1](c ) we present the level curves of the hamiltonian ( [ hamc ] ) for @xmath79 , illustrating the behaviour of regions i , ii , iii and i ( from the top to the bottom ) . in region",
    "i there is a maximal point at @xmath54 and a minima at @xmath92 .",
    "two additional fixed points , a saddle and a maximum occur , in region ii at @xmath54 , while two additional fixed points , a saddle and a minimum , occur in region iii at @xmath92 compared to region i.    we observe that the pattern of the level curves is distinct for the cases of @xmath43 negative and zero compared to the positive case .    in the following sections we will conduct an analysis of the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "we will focus our attention on the case @xmath93 , in this way the model has one effective parameter , @xmath76 .",
    "in particular we will establish that the bifurcation occurring at @xmath94 for the negative case and @xmath95 for @xmath50 can be seen to influence the ground state properties of the quantum system .",
    "we now turn our attention to a quantum treatment of the model , to investigate the nature of the additional threshold couplings for the cases where the fractional atomic imbalance @xmath43 is negative and zero . in particular",
    "we analyze the hamiltonian in the _ no scattering limit _ where @xmath96 for all @xmath97    @xmath98    this simplifies substantially the hamiltonian , however it remains sufficiently non trivial to enable us to gain an understanding of the quantum behaviour through the quantum dynamics , ground - state expectation value , gap and fidelity .",
    "the _ no scattering limit _ corresponds to the coupling @xmath93 in the classical analysis of section @xmath99 . with reference to fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] there are two threshold couplings when @xmath43 is negative and three threshold couplings for @xmath50 . for the case of @xmath43 negative",
    ", one occurs at @xmath94 , signifying the bifurcation of the global minimum of the hamiltonian , while the other occurs at @xmath100 , signifying the bifurcation of the global maximum . for the specific example of @xmath89 , these thresholds are @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . for the case",
    "@xmath50 , there are three bifurcations at @xmath103 . the case @xmath104 signifying the bifurcation of the global maximum , @xmath95 signifying the bifurcation of the global minimum while @xmath105 signifying the bifurcation of the saddle point .",
    "in contrast , there are no bifurcations along the line @xmath93 for the positive case .",
    "we focus our attention to the coupling @xmath106 for @xmath89 and @xmath95 for @xmath50 , as in these cases the bifurcation of the fixed point in phase space is associated with the ground state of the quantum system .      in general the time evolution of any state is given by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the temporal operator @xmath109 , @xmath110 is an eigenstate with energy @xmath111 and @xmath112 represents the initial state with @xmath113 .",
    "we adopt the method of directly diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ hamreduzido ] ) as done in @xcite and compute the expectation value of @xmath114 through .",

    "we therefore compare the three cases of the quantum dynamics , with fractional atomic imbalance negative , zero and positive .",
    "results of the expectation value for @xmath26 are shown in fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] for the cases of @xmath89 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we are using @xmath120 and @xmath121 for @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "we fix the parameter @xmath123 and use @xmath124 as the variable coupling parameter . in terms of the classical variables ,",
    "this corresponds to vary the parameter @xmath76 .",
    "the qualitative differences are quite apparent . in the case of @xmath89 ,",
    "[ dynamics](a ) , we find that for @xmath125 there are irregular oscillations in @xmath26 .",
    "similar behaviour occurs for @xmath126 for @xmath50 , fig .",
    "[ dynamics](b ) .",
    "as the coupling parameter @xmath76 is increased across the threshold value at @xmath127 , for @xmath89 and @xmath128 for @xmath50 , the transition to localized oscillations is significant in cases ( a ) and ( b ) . by comparison the dynamics in fig .",

    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figexpectation ] .    in general , agreement with the classical result is found : as the threshold coupling @xmath127 ( for @xmath89 ) and @xmath128 ( for @xmath50 ) is crossed , the maximal possible number of molecules that can be formed for each case ( @xmath130 for @xmath89 and @xmath131 for @xmath50 ) is reached . in both cases",
    ", there is an abrupt change in the expectation value @xmath132 at the threshold point .",
    "however , for @xmath50 , the expectation value @xmath132 does not exhibit any sudden change , indicative of the fact that there is no boundary in fig . [ fig:2](c ) .",
    "therefore , qualitative changes are observed between the cases of @xmath43 negative and zero and the case of @xmath43 positive .      in order to gain a better insight into the effect of the threshold couplings for the quantum system , in our final analysis we investigate the existence of quantum phase transitions in our model ( [ hamreduzido ] ) .    a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) is usually defined as a phase transition in the ground - state of the system under the variation of some parameter .",
    "basically , there is a sudden change in the structure of the ground state at the qpt , and the properties such as entanglement , correlations , etc reflect this sudden change @xcite .",
    "there are different methods to determine a qpt .",
    "in particular , we will study the behaviour of the energy gap and fidelity of the system to identify a qpt . here",
    "we mention that a qpt is rigorously defined in the thermodynamical limit @xmath133 . for large but finite @xmath17",
    "the system does display an increasing sharp distinction between ground state regions , called quantum pre - phase transitions ( qppt ) .",
    "the occurrence of a qppt in a finite system is a precursor for a qpt in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us now study the qppt of the hamiltonian ( [ hamreduzido ] ) .",
    "one possibility to identify a qppt is through the energy gap , which is defined as the difference between the first excited state and the ground - state of the system .",
    "@xmath134    in fig .",
    "[ gap ] we plot the gap against the coupling parameter @xmath76 for the cases of @xmath135 and @xmath119 using @xmath123 and different values of @xmath17 . in all cases",
    "the energy gap exhibits a minimum , which is much more pronounced in the cases of @xmath43 negative and zero compared to the case where @xmath43 is positive .",
    "we observe that as long as @xmath17 increases , the point where the gap tends to vanish corresponds to @xmath127 for @xmath89 ( fig .",
    "[ gap](a ) ) and @xmath128 for @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ gap](b ) ) , in agreement with the classical analysis .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath43 is positive there is no abrupt variation of the energy gap as shown in fig .",
    "[ gap](c ) and qppt are not expected .",
    "another possibility to investigate the qppt is through the behaviour of the fidelity , which is a concept widely used in the quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "the fidelity is basically defined as the modulus of the wavefunction overlap between two quantum states . assuming the ground state of the system is non - degenerate , let @xmath136 denote the unique normalized ground state . for fixed small @xmath137",
    "we define the function fidelity or ground - state wavefunction overlap @xmath138 by @xmath139 which is symmetric in @xmath137 , bounded between @xmath118 and @xmath140 and satisfies @xmath141 . for systems which exhibit a quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the wavefunction overlaps between states in different phases go to zero in this limit .",
    "the occurrence of a minimum in the ground - state wavefunction overlap in a finite system is then a precursor for a quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus for finite systems we identify quantum phase _ pre - transitions _ at a coupling @xmath76 for which the fidelity is ( locally ) minimal .",
    "fig [ fid ] shows the behaviour of the fidelity for ( a ) @xmath89 ; ( b ) @xmath50 ; ( c ) @xmath79 for fixed @xmath142 and different values of @xmath143 on the top ( bottom ) .",
    "it is clear that the minimum value of @xmath138 , which determines the quantum phase pre - transition , tends to occur at @xmath144 for @xmath89 and @xmath145 for @xmath50 .",
    "the distinction between the predicted threshold coupling and the observed pre - transition coupling is that the pre - transition coupling also occurs for @xmath43 positive , although for fixed @xmath17 the minimum of @xmath138 is substantially more pronounced for @xmath43 negative and zero compared to @xmath43 positive . in all instances the value of minimum decreases with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that the value of @xmath76 at which the minimum occurs is independent of @xmath137 , as shown in fig.[fid ] ( on the top ) . in our previous classical analysis",
    "qualitative differences are only found precisely when @xmath43 is negative or zero .",
    "here it is clear that the distinguishability of two phases is more reliable also for @xmath43 negative or zero .",
    "we then interpret these results as the emergence of quantum phase boundaries for @xmath43 negative or zero .",
    "we have considered a model describing a mixture of two species of atoms in different proportions which can combine to form a bound molecular state at zero temperature .",
    "this hetero - triatomic molecular bose - einstein condensate model has been investigated in detail through a classical and a quantum analysis .",
    "we have found that the fractional atomic population imbalance @xmath43 , an extra control `` knob '' characteristic to heteronuclear models , plays an important role in the determination of the phase boundaries in the diagram of parameters in the classical analysis .",
    "this property also holds at a quantum level by inspecting the ground - state expectation values and the character of the quantum dynamics of the model .",
    "we have also looked for the quantum phase pre - transitions in our system and shown that the quantities energy gap and ground state fidelity are suited for revealing qppt and pinning down the critical(bifurcation ) points .",
