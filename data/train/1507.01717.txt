    "<S> unfortunately , a complete theoretical understanding of this phenomenon is still lacking and there is no theory that can simultaneously describe all stages of the experiment . while the so - called s - theory @xcite is able to describe the parametric resonance used to populate certain magnon states , it does not properly take magnon - magnon scattering into account and therefore can not describe the cascade of relaxation processes leading to the formation of a magnon condensate . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , theories that focus on the condensate usually do not take the pumping dynamics into account and start with some given quasiequilibrium state which can be identified with the ground state of some effective quantum mechanical hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological approaches of the ginzburg - landau type also have been used to study the condensation dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , theories dealing with the relaxation processes and kinetics of excited magnons did not include the possibility of magnon condensation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since bec is a manifestation of quantum mechanics , it seems at the first sight reasonable that quantized magnons obeying bose statistics are essential to obtain a satisfactory theoretical description of magnon condensation in yig . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the experiments are performed at room temperature , which is large compared with the relevant magnon energies , the equilibrium distribution of the magnons is the rayleigh - jeans rather than the bose - einstein distribution . </S>",
