    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) of iii - v or ii - vi types have been obtained by doping semiconductors with magnetic impurities ( mn for example)@xcite .",
    "these materials are very interesting due to their potential applications for spintronics@xcite .",
    "however , the low curie temperature ( @xmath5 ) has limited their interest@xcite ( for example ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as , with @xmath6 has a @xmath7@xcite ) .",
    "based on the theoretical works of dietl _",
    "et al._@xcite , several groups @xcite have studied the growth of co - doped zno films@xcite which is a good candidate having a high @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "using pulsed laser depositions ( pld ) , ueda _ et al .",
    "_ reported ferromagnetism ( fm ) above room temperature@xcite , while jin _",
    "et al . _ found no indication of fm by utilizing laser molecular beam epitaxy@xcite .",
    "this controversy between research teams may result from the growth method used and/or from the growth conditions ( oxygen pressure , deposition temperature , etc ... ) . in the particular case of the pld technique",
    ", it may also arise from the targets preparation and this parameter has never been considered up to now .",
    "one of the reason is that the control of the dopant incorporation would be quite difficult to obtain using a pre - doped ceramic oxide target@xcite .",
    "this is a crucial point since the properties of the dms are very sensitive to the percentage of dopant@xcite .",
    "the homogeneity of dopant incorporation as well as the precise control of the growth might be responsible for the changes in the physical properties of the films obtained by the different groups .",
    "thus , we have recently developed an accurate method to grow the zn@xmath0co@xmath1o films with a precise doping by using an alternate deposition starting from zn and co targets . using this procedure@xcite ,",
    "we have been able to observe ferromagnetism at room temperature in one sample having the composition zn@xmath9co@xmath10o confirming previous results@xcite but in contrast to others@xcite . in this paper , we have grown a series of zn@xmath0co@xmath1o films with very low doping of co. we have studied the structural and magnetic properties of the films and our results are reported in this communication .",
    "the zn@xmath0co@xmath1o films were grown using the pulsed laser deposition technique .",
    "metal zinc ( @xmath11 ) and cobalt ( @xmath11 ) targets were used as purchased ( neyco , france ) without further preparations .",
    "the films are deposited using a krf laser ( @xmath12)@xcite on ( 0001 ) al@xmath3o@xmath13 substrates ( in this paper , we used the three - index notation instead of the four - index one@xcite ) .",
    "the substrates were kept at a constant temperature in the range 500@xmath14c-750@xmath14c during the deposition which was carried out a pressure around @xmath15 of pure oxygen . after deposition , the samples",
    "were slowly cooled to room temperature at a pressure of @xmath16 of o@xmath3 .",
    "the deposition rate is @xmath17 and the energy density is close to @xmath18 .",
    "the composition of the film was checked by energy dispersive scattering and rutherford backscattering spectometry ( rbs ) .",
    "the structural study was done by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a seifert xrd 3000p for the @xmath19 scans and the @xmath20scan to evaluate the full - width - at - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "an xpert phillips was utilized for the _ in - plane _ measurements obtained from the ( @xmath21 ) reflection .",
    "ion channeling technique ( with 2 mev he@xmath22 ions ) was used to study the epitaxial nature of the films .",
    "magnetization ( @xmath23 ) was recorded as a function of the temperature ( @xmath24 ) and the magnetic field ( @xmath25 ) in a squid  magnetometer .",
    "zno thin film was deposited using the optimal conditions found previously@xcite .",
    "the films are highly crystallized as seen from the sharp diffraction peaks ( fig.1 ) and the fwhm of the rocking curve close to 0.25@xmath26 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the two diffractions peaks observed around @xmath27 and @xmath28 are characteristic of the hexagonal zno wurtzite , the @xmath29-axis being perpendicular to the substrate plane .",
    "the out - of - plane lattice parameter is calculated to be @xmath30 which corresponds to the theoretical bulk one@xcite .",
    "the epitaxial relationships between zno films and al@xmath3o@xmath4 substrates are determined using asymmetrical xrd .",
    "the inset of fig.1 displays the @xmath31scan both of the zno films obtained from the ( @xmath21 ) planes and the al@xmath3o@xmath4 substrate obtained from the ( @xmath32 ) planes .",
    "the peaks belonging to the film are separated by 60@xmath14 , indicating a six - fold symmetry in agreement with the hexagonal structure of zno whereas the peaks of the sapphire substrate are separated of 120@xmath14 indicating a three - fold symmetry in agreement with the rhombohedral symmetry of al@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "note that 30@xmath14 spacing between the diffraction peaks of the film and those of the substrate indicate a rotation of 30@xmath14 between the in - plane axes . in order to obtain additional information , on the structural properties of the zno films , we have determined the strains of the optimized film .",
    "this technique used the distance between atomic plane of a crystalline specimen as an internal strain gage@xcite . using this model , we minimized the strains of the zno film by changing the growth conditions @xcite . at a temperature of 600@xmath33 under @xmath15 of o@xmath3",
    ", we found@xcite that the value of residual stress ( @xmath34 ) along the in_-plane _ direction ( @xmath35 ) is about the same value along the _ out  of - plane _ direction ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "such values are in agreement with previous report @xcite .",
    "the study of the ( @xmath37 ) planes indicates a concentration gradient along the _ out - of - plane _ direction .  in other words , the strains is larger near the interface and decreases along the _ out - of - plane _ direction as the thickness increases .",
    "indeed , when the thickness of the film , the substrate - induced strain becomes lower and the lattice parameters of films become closer to the value of the bulk . moreover",
    ", the positive slope@xcite indicates an extensive stress _ in - the - plane _ of the substrate which is in agreement@xcite with the decrease of the _ out - of - plane _ lattice parameter as compared to the bulk value@xcite .",
    "these conditions have been used to grow the zn@xmath0co@xmath1o films with various doping x.  an example of the ion backscattering channeling data for zn@xmath0co@xmath1o ( x=4% ) is given in fig.2 .",
    "the observed minimum yield @xmath38 of @xmath395% for channeling reflects good quality of the film , thereby indicating optimum growth of zn@xmath0co@xmath1o films .",
    "note also that a surface peak of co is seen which reveals that the top layer ( about 400@xmath40 ) has large amount of co ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the channeling spectrum also shows the co signal .",
    "this indicates that the co in this layer has not gone substitutional .",
    "fig.3 shows the @xmath19 scans recorded around the @xmath42 reflection in the the range @xmath43 .",
    "as the co content is increasing there is a shift toward the high angle , indicating a decrease of the _ out - of - plane _ lattice parameter up to @xmath44 .  above this value ,",
    "the position of the diffraction peak is moving toward the low values of 2@xmath45 , leading to an increase of the lattice parameter up to @xmath46 .",
    "then , the _ out - of - plane _ lattice parameter becomes constant@xcite ( not show in this graph ) .",
    "to explain this results , we consider the zno bulk wurtzite structure , where zinc ( zn@xmath47 ) is in tetrahedral site with a ionic radius of @xmath48@xcite .",
    "the substitution of the zn@xmath47 with co@xmath47 ( ionic radius : @xmath49@xcite ) leads to a compression of the bulk structure and a decrease of the lattice parameters.on the contrary , a higher coordination number of co@xmath47 leads to an ionic radius of co@xmath47 larger than the ionic radius of zn@xmath47 . in this configuration",
    ", co@xmath47 would be in an interstitial site inducing an expansion of the structure ( and an increase of the lattice parameters ) and thus , an increase of defects . in the thin film , due to the substrate - induced strains , this will lead to a decrease of the _ out - of - plane _ lattice parameter ( up to @xmath44 of co ) and then to an increase of this parameter ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this explanation ( substitution and then interstitial co ) is also confirmed by looking at the evolution of the fwhm of the rocking curve as a function of the co content ( see fig.4 ) where the same tendancy is observed .",
    "for very low doping of co ( @xmath51 ) , the fwhm is slightly decreasing up to @xmath52 of co. above this value ( @xmath53 ) , the fwhm increases when the co content is also increasing indicating that for these values of doping , the films are less oriented and/or contained more defects .",
    "we investigated the magnetic properties of these thin film samples .",
    "fig.5 shows the @xmath54 recorded for various zn@xmath0co@xmath1o film .",
    "the films at low doping of co ( @xmath44 and @xmath55 ) clearly evidence a ferromagnetic state with a curie temperature respectively around @xmath56  and @xmath57 . for the other concentration of co ,",
    "the situation is more confusing .",
    "we have performed @xmath58 at different temperatures but we did not observed any hysteresis .",
    "we also measure the magnetization in very low doping ( @xmath59 ) but the signal of the substrate is too high .",
    "we discuss now the possibility of the co clusters in our films .",
    "the transition from the ferromagnetic state to the paramagnetic state is clearly seen , suggesting that the metallic co clusters ( the @xmath8  of the metal co clusters is above 1000k ) are not responsible for the effect observed at 300k @xcite .  moreover , the saturation moment ( 0.7 @xmath60/mole co ) is very weak compared to @xmath61 of metallic co@xmath62}$ ] , suggesting that the co state should be close to co@xmath47 . we believe that this is due to the technique used in the study where not only the conditions of the deposition minimize the strains but also the alternate deposition from the two targets favors the homogeneity of the doped films .",
    "moreover , it has been seen that the low temperature ( 600@xmath33 is our case ) of deposition leads to homogenous films@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed an alternative method for the growth of pulsed laser deposited oxide thin films .",
    "this method permits an accurate control of the dopant in the matrix .",
    "firstly using this procedure , we have deposited high quality zn@xmath0co@xmath1o thin films on al@xmath3o@xmath4 ( 0001 ) substrates with a low doping of co.  secondly , we have also studied the evolution of the structure and the magnetic properties of the films for various co concentration .",
    "we suggest that the incorporation of co inside the wurtzite structure leads to an increase of interstitial defects while the epitaxial defects decrease .",
    "finally , the growth of these ferromagnetic films opens the route for the fabrication of spin - based electronics since this original method can be used to grow various oxide thin films .",
    "we acknowledge the centre franco - indien pour la promotion de la recherche avancee / indo - french centre for the promotion of advance research ( cefipra / ifcpar ) for financial support ( project n@xmath142808 - 1 ) .",
