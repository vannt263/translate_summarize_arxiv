    "most of the work on the electroweak symmetry breaking sector can be grouped into the following three categories : 1 ) precision calculations for the higgs mass within the sm and in bsm models , 2 ) precision calculations for electroweak ( ew ) processes relevant to the ew sector , and 3 ) higgs production processes .",
    "each of the categories comprises studies and calculations within the sm as well as in bsm models .",
    "the first category on precision calculations for the higgs mass is still one of the most important issues for the reduction of the theory error on the higgs mass prediction which is highly relevant for the higgs searches and potential measurements at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this part and also the third part , the precision calculations for specific higgs production ( and decay ) channels are not covered , mainly because there has not been done much on these subjects in the past three years , or the results are covered elsewhere .",
    "several topics that fit in the context of this document have also been covered by other people during the lcws conference in granada like higgs production in susy decays  @xcite , composite higgs physics  @xcite , the non - minimal flavor - violating ( nmfv ) mssm  @xcite , precision studies of the 2hdm  @xcite , or also the higgs sector of a pure @xmath0 model  @xcite .",
    "two of the most important processes to check and overconstrain the sector of electroweak symmetry breaking both at lhc as well as a future linear collider are triboson production and vector boson scattering .",
    "the processes @xmath1 are commonly viewed as a logical continuation of the physics from @xmath2 production at     and @xmath3 distributions for @xmath4 .",

    "@xcite it was shown that both processes at a 1 tev ilc allow for a precision measurement of the quartic gauge couplings ( qgc ) and a possible determination anomalous qgcs or constraining them much better than the projected measurement capabilities at the lhc .",
    "the @xmath5 channel alone enables one to constrain the parameter space in the @xmath6 anomalous qgc parameters , while combining this with the @xmath7 measurement shrinks the confidence level ellipses besides its much lower statistics by a factor three to four . to determine deviations from the sm qgc with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath8 a theoretical precision of at the per - mil level .",
    "there have been three different groups calculating the nlo corrections to the two triboson production processes @xmath9 ,  @xcite . in the t hooft - feynman gauge used in ref .",
    "@xcite the nlo corrections comprise 2700 diagrams for the @xmath5 channel including 109 pentagon diagrams , while the corresponding @xmath7 process has roughly 1800 diagrams containing 64 pentagons .",
    "they used two different independent codes , both based on the ` feynarts / formcalc ` package  @xcite .",
    "the calculation has been performed in the kinematic regime where @xmath10 is below the higgs threshold , using the on - shell renormalization scheme , the passarino - veltman tensor reduction  @xcite , and the method proposed in  @xcite to avoid numerical instabilities from vanishing inverse gram determinants .",
    "they compared the catani - seymour dipole subtraction method  @xcite as well as a phase - space slicing method to treat the soft - collinear divergencies , which agree until the soft - collinear approximation breaks down .",
    "both groups  @xcite compared their results with each other and found agreement .",
    "the dominant electroweak corrections come from qed initial state radiation ( isr ) , which can be subtracted to obtain the genuine weak corrections based either on the catani - seymour method or on an experimental extraction from @xmath7 .",
    "the peak cross section @xmath11 fb is much larger than the corresponding @xmath12 fb .",
    "the full ew corrections including qed isr are negative and amount to -30 % of the cross section , while the genuine ew corrections are of the order of -7 to -18 % , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : wwz_nlo ] this calculation is consistent with estimates from ew double - logarithmic sudakov corrections  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite have studied the influence of finite - width effects in the near - threshold production at the ilc .",
    "they find that using finite widths for ew gauge bosons as well as the higgs could alter the lineshape of the process cross sections at the level of 20 - 30 per cent .",
    "however , a proper treatment using resummation would be highly desirable here .",
    "as has been also shown in  @xcite , vector boson scattering is an even more powerful tool to examine and ( over)constrain the ewsb sector ( for an overview how to describe resonances in the ew sector for center - of - mass energies of 1 tev and larger see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the top yukawa coupling might play a special role in the sm as the only coupling of order one , hence , it is an interesting topic to study vector boson scattering to a top quark pair . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors have calculated the qcd and ew nlo corrections to this scattering process @xmath13 in the on - shell scheme .",
    "they find that the corrections grow with rising higgs mass and that the ew corrections mostly cancel the qcd corrections such that the total corrections over most of the mass range are only of the order of @xmath14 % , cf . the left plot in fig .  [ vbs_nlo ] .",
    "the calculations are for the @xmath15 scattering process , and the final results have been obtained in the effective w approximation ( ewa ) , i.e. using structure functions for the @xmath16 as a parton in the electron . such a description is known to give rise to deviations of differential cross sections from irreducible background from @xmath16 bremsstrahlung .",

    "it is nevertheless worthwhile to study the production where only one of the two is on - shell and then goes into a top - bottom pair , hence the process : @xmath24 .",
    "this is specifically important in the high higgs mass region and in the decoupling limit .",
    "the sm qcd nlo corrections for that process have been calculated in  @xcite .",

    "they found that the corrections are enhanced in the parameter region of large @xmath25 which can as usual be accounted for by a resummed bottom yukawa coupling .",
    "the residual susy qcd corrections are of the order of @xmath26 to @xmath27 % .",

    "such operators like @xmath39 could even dominate the chiral sm interactions , and are hence easy , but also worthwile to study .",

    "the indirect bounds together with the searches from tevatron ( which had almost never been able to see these states ) yield a lower bound like @xmath48 gev .",

    "these models have as generic properties an extended global symmetry together with an extended scalar sector compared to the sm , an extended gauge symmetry and hence new heavy vectors ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , as well as new heavy fermions , especially a heavy top quark @xmath65 .",
    "some of these models have a discrete symmetry , called @xmath65-parity in order to further ameliorate ew precision observables .",
    "this allows then for dark matter .",
    "generically , there are two types of models , the product group model , where the scalars are in an irreducible representation ( irrep ) , while the weak gauge group is a product group , and the simple group models , where the weak gauge group is simple and the scalar modes are in a product group representation .",
    "the most important model of the first class is the littlest higgs  @xcite , and the simplest little higgs  @xcite of the second class , respectively . in the littlest higgs ,",
    "the essential parameters of these models are the intermediate scale which sets the mass for the additional weakly interacting states as well as the higgs triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "constraints from ew precision observables demand @xmath66 tev , and @xmath67 gev  @xcite . as the goldstone bosons from the complex higgs triplet of that model are difficult to see at the lhc , ref .",

    "recently , the top quark - associated production of such a pseudo - axion has been revisited for the simplest little higgs with @xmath65-parity  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections are compatible with the corresponding @xmath69 cross sections from the sm or the mssm , namely roughly 1 fb . the authors also added the @xmath70 production from @xmath71-induced interactions . generically , all these cross sections are not too promising but they add an additional source for measurements within the simplest little higgs .",
    "twin - higgs models are extensions of the sm by a discrete ( parity ) symmetry .",
    "this could be either a mirror symmetry  @xcite , or a discrete left - right exchange symmetry  @xcite .",
    "these models are similar to little higgs as there are goldstone bosons arising from the breaking of a large(r ) global symmetry .",
    "the parity doubling is responsible for the cancellation of the quadratic divergencies .",
    "the special thing about these models is that they have no new colored states , hence they are notoriously difficult to discover at the lhc .",
    "it is only the higgs which communicates to the mirror sector .",
    "drell - yan production is possible but suffers from large backgrounds .",
    "in the left - right symmetric twin - higgs model ( lrth )  @xcite there is a @xmath72 global symmetry , and a gauge left - right symmetry , @xmath73 .",

    "@xcite the pair production of @xmath77 has been calculated in the lrth .",
    "the cross sections are marginal and even close to threshold not larger than one fb , but can give rise to @xmath63 resonances at clic in the range above 1 tev . as the predominant decay is @xmath78 , these states are only limited by the detector resolution .",
    "another publication estimated the corrections to ( multiple ) higgsstrahlung @xmath79 in the lr twin - higgs model ,  @xcite .",
    "as has been studied in the context of little higgs models , extensions of the ew higgs sector can drastically enhance these processes  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement auf these cross sections makes the processes available as discovery modes at an ilc or clic .",
    "screening the literature and work on electroweak and higgs physics ( precision ) calculations of the last couple of years with emphasis on a future linear collider shows that we are well prepared for the physics at such a machine . basically all signal and",
    "most background processes are known at next - to - leading order , while some of the open processes like vector boson scattering and triboson production have been calculated at nlo recently .",
    "these processes are the cornerstone of the high - luminosity and/or high - energy physics program , and they are at the heart of ew symmetry breaking .",
    "one of the final open tasks after a possible discovery of a sm - like higgs boson and its precision taxonomy at lhc and ilc / clic will be the mapping out of the higgs potential to find out whether this is indeed as given in the sm or has some deeper mechanism leading to its generation .",
    "concerning beyond the standard model ( bsm ) physics , the focus in the recent years was on ew symmetry breaking - related processes in mostly strongly interacting models like little higgs , technicolor , topcolor and twin - higgs models .",
    "specifically multiple production of scalar particles as well as production in association with top quarks or the ew gauge bosons have been the driving forces of the investigations .",
    "generically , one can say that guidance is needed from the higgs - sector measurements and the high - energy phase of lhc to know in which direction to turn for a future ilc / clic .",
