    "the cobaltites rebaco@xmath12o@xmath13 have displayed a structural phase transition manifestative through stepwise changes of physical properties .",
    "peak - like anomalies of specific heat were observed for re = lu , yb , tm , er in the range of transition temperatures @xmath14 between 160 k ( lu ) and 280 k ( er)@xcite .",
    "magnetization @xcite , seebek coefficient@xcite and resistivity@xcite drop abruptly as temperature increases through the re - specific value of @xmath14 . because of the mixed valence of co ( averaged valence `` + 2.25 '' ) there may occur different distributions of charges in the low- and high - temperature phases .",
    "therefore , the transition was conjectured to be driven by the charge ordering in the co subsystem@xcite .",
    "rebaco@xmath12o@xmath13 belongs to the family of swedenborgite , whose structure was solved by pauling et al@xcite in 1935 .",
    "the swedenborgite sbnabe@xmath15o@xmath13 was described as a net built up of starlike be@xmath12o@xmath16 clusters@xcite , and similar co@xmath12o@xmath16 stars can be found in rebaco@xmath12o@xmath13 .",
    "two nonequivalent sites of co exist in high - temperature hexagonal phase @xcite , but four co sites in low - temperature orthorhombic phase@xcite .",
    "clearly , some redistribution of charge should be associated with changing the symmetry .",
    "it remains under debate , however , whether or not the transition itself is driven by the charge redistribution .",
    "both phases consist of regular 1:1 stacking of kagom and triangular layers of coo@xmath12 tetrahedra ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in each of the phases",
    ", there are 75% of co sites in kagom layers and 25% of co sites in triangular layers .",
    "each co@xmath12o@xmath16 star thus involves three tetrahedra in k - layer and one in t - layer .",
    "we found relative arrangement of these stars unchanged , however their exact geometry somewhat changes through @xmath14 .    from analyzing the bond valence sums in both the low- and high - temperature phases",
    "huq et al@xcite derived the preference of the co site in the triangular layers for the co@xmath17 ion at @xmath18 , but , contrarily , for the co@xmath19 ion at @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "it was argued recently @xcite that the co sites in triangular layers are generally exhibiting shorter co - o distances than the sites in kagom layers , irrespectively of the transition at @xmath14 ; the co@xmath17 ions should always prefer the site in triangular layers .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig_1.eps    in this work , we investigate the phase transition in hobaco@xmath12o@xmath13 using the synchrotron diffractometry , mssbauer spectroscopy , and xafs .",
    "it was verified that the substitution of 2.5% of co with fe did not introduce a significant change of @xmath21 k. we observed only very small changes in mssbauer spectra through @xmath14 and we argue that no charge ordering takes place at the phase transition .",
    "different symmetry groups were tested to fit the phases below @xmath14 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and above @xmath14 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . from the results of our structural study",
    "the origin of the phase transition is understood to be unrelated to charge redistribution .",
    "we consider instead the double - well potential models@xcite , in which the transition can be explained as the condensation of a libration phonon mode associated with the rigid - body motion of the tetrahedra in kagom layers around the center of the abovementioned co@xmath12o@xmath16 stars .",

    "makes a number of ba bondlengths increasing , and the same number of ba bondlengths decreasing .",
    "the average ba - o distance remains unchanged .",
    "namely , within the @xmath24 model , 6 oxygens of 12 remains at the ideal distances , 3 of them are allowed to move inwards and 3 other outwards of the ideal anticubooctahedron . for the @xmath22 model ,",
    "such a ratio changes from 3:6:3 to 5:2:5 .",
    "the lower symmetries @xmath25 and @xmath23 allow the distortion ratio 6:0:6 , however , in ybbaco@xmath12o@xmath13 huq et al.@xcite obtained within the @xmath25 model the anticubooctahedron distortion scheme 3:6:3 similar to that of @xmath24 model .",
    "this means the very small changes of bondlengths of 6 oxygens compared to the ideal anticubooctahedron .",
    "therefore , the authors argued that the change of the distortion scheme of the anticubooctahedron from `` 3:6:3''-like above @xmath14 to 6:0:6 below @xmath14 is at the origin of the phase transition .",
    "this conclusion is not contradictive to our viewpoint , the more especially as we fitted successively the high - temperature phase only with the @xmath24 model , which is intrinsically distorted according to the same 3:6:3 scheme .",
    "although both the @xmath24 and @xmath25 models result in similar r - factors for the high - temperature phase , only the @xmath24 model gave us plausible interatomic distances .",
    "indeed , when trying to fit the high - temperature phase with the @xmath25 model , we obtained the distortion of the anticubooctahedron much larger than that reported by huq et al.@xcite .",
    "in addition , the unrealistic co - o distances of the order of 1.7   resulted , which obliged us to reject the @xmath25 model .",
    "thus the driving force of the transition to lower symmetry is likely to arise from too loose bonding of ba@xmath19 in the symmetric anticubooctahedron .",
    "while the ba@xmath19 coordination polyhedron tends to collapse with lowering temperature , we do not observe that the coordination polyhedra of the co ions change so dramatically .",
    "displacive phase transitions in the tetrahedral networks are frequently driven by a soft optic phonon , which can propagate without distortions of tetrahedra .",
    "such modes were called rigid - unit modes ( rums)@xcite .",
    "the coordination polyhedron of ba@xmath19 is formed by o2 and o3 atoms .",
    "each of these oxygens enters the first coordination sphere of two co , two ba@xmath175 and one ho@xmath17 . on the other hand",
    ", the o1 atom enters to the first coordination sphere of four co ions .",
    "therefore , the deformation of the ba@xmath19 coordination correspond to the motion of o2 and o3 atoms , which would be also represented in terms of kagom network as the motion of the of the o2 and o3 tetrahedral vertices around the o1 vertex .",
    "this is because each co in the kagom layer ( co2 site ) is coordinated by one o1 , one o3 and two o2 atoms .",
    "since the more covalent bonding is stronger within the framework of the coo@xmath12 tetrahedra compared to the ionic bonding on the exterior of the framework , the distortion of the tetrahedra will cost more energy .",
    "the associated with such a distortion phonon modes would lie rather high on the frequency scale . on the opposite , the rums that do not involve any significant stretching of the co",
    "- o bonds will have low frequencies .",
    "one of the low - energy rums appears to be strongly temperature - dependent to become a soft mode driving the phase transition .",
    "this mode permits the intertetrahedral motions associated with bending the co - o - co links , where the central o atom can be viewed as a `` hinge '' .",
    "the rotations of tetrahedra around the `` hinges '' are hindered either by the size of collapsed cavity around ba@xmath19 or by repulsion between oxygens getting too close to each other .",
    "such hindered rotations named librations are commonly observed in tetrahedral networks @xcite . in fig.11 , the o-``hinge ''",
    "can be identified at the o1 atom ( exactly at the center of the top panel in fig .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig11.eps    from fig",
    ". 7 it is evident that our low - temperature phase is quite similar to that reported for ybbaco@xmath12o@xmath13@xcite .",
    "it is also clear that the low - temperature phase can be obtained from the high - temperature one via quenching the positions of the o3 atoms at the endpoints of a counterclockwise rotation .",
    "since the o3 site splits into three below @xmath14 the rotation angles are different ( in the range between 5 and 10 deg . ) for o31 , o32 and o33 .",
    "the rotation axis [ 001 ] is the same for o31 , o32 and o33 , therefore , these oxygens keep their planar arrangement as in high - temperature phase ( see the central plane at the bottom of t - layer in fig.1 ) .",
    "according to the rums concept , the axial rotation of the tetrahedral vertices located on top ( in terms of fig.1 ) of the kagom layers can not occur without @xmath108-displacements of the o2 atoms at the bottom of these kagom layers .",
    "this is because only 25% of the oxygens at the bottom of kagom layers are located on the rotation axes .",
    "these o1 atoms constitute the rotation `` hinges '' .",
    "other 75% oxygen sites in this plane are the o2 sites , which split into o21 , o22 and o23 in the low - temperature phase .",
    "due to the rotation of the tetrahedral `` rigid units '' the o21 and o22 atoms get out of the plane , in which they were in the high - temperature phase .",
    "the shift of the o21 site along @xmath108-axis is as large as 0.52  .",
    "this is consistent with the largest rotation angle @xmath176 for the o31 atom , which belongs to the tetrahedra of co21 ( in fig.7 two of these tetrahedra form a vertical `` sandglass '' figure extended along @xmath177-axis around the central o1 atom ) .",
    "smaller rotation angles are shown in fig.7 for the o32 and o33 atoms , which belong to the tetrahedra of co22 and co23 , respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with smaller out - of - plane @xmath108-shift of the o22 atoms ( 0.14  ) , which belong to both co22 and co23 tetrahedra .",
    "the third site o23 remains at the same @xmath108-level as in high - temperature phase .",
    "this site belongs to co21 and co23 tetrahedra .",
    "thus , the tetrahedra faces , which were parallel in high - temperature phase , become slightly tilted relative to horizontal plane . the measure of tilts for the bottom faces of co21 and co23 tetrahedra",
    "are the @xmath108-shifts of corresponding vertices , i.e. , 0.52   and 0.14  , for co21 and co23 tetrahedra , respectively .",
    "the degree of tilt for the co22 tetrahedra , which is formed by the o21 and o22 vertices is measured by the difference of their @xmath108-shifts , is @xmath178  .",
    "this relationship directly follows from the symmetry pbn2@xmath43 .",
    "because of such a relationship between the values of @xmath108-shifts for o21 , o22 and o23 atoms the spread between the tilts of three tetrahedra surrounding the o1-hinge becomes unavoidable .",
    "quite similar spread was obtained by huq et al.@xcite .",
    "if the tetrahedra are indeed behaving as rigid - units , the related spread would in turn appear in the angles of rotation of the three o3 atoms around the o1@xmath108 axis . comparing the results of our refinement with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite , we show in fig.10 that the spread is quite similar for hobaco@xmath12o@xmath13 and ybbaco@xmath12o@xmath13 .    in high - temperature phase , where all three o3 atoms around the o1@xmath108 axis are equivalent , they librate with equally large amplitudes as shown at the upper panel of fig.7 .",
    "the thermal displacements of o3 atoms have no component along @xmath108 , however , the @xmath179component is the main component for o2 atoms ( see the footnote of table 3 ) .",
    "however , because the rigidity of tetrahedra put the constraint on the @xmath179shifts of three o2 atoms , the rotations can not be condensed below @xmath14 within the high - symmetry model @xmath24 , in which all of the o2 sites are equivalent .",
    "therefore , the rigid - body libration of tetrahedra lowers the symmetry , so that the orthorhombicity directly follows from combining the rum condensation with translation symmetry .    in tetrahedral networks ,",
    "various constraints on possible models of deformation of these networks were described previously by dove et al@xcite . in the anion - close - packed systems ,",
    "the structure becomes highly susceptible to the libration - like motions when the proportion of `` bridgelike '' two - coordinated anions is large .",
    "for example , in the red mercury hgi@xmath28 , where all the anions are bridgelike , the coupled librations of hgi@xmath12 tetrahedra are unconstrainted and the thermal displacements of anions are strongly anisotropic@xcite .",
    "this is not the case for the built of tetrahedra and octahedra structure of spinel m@xmath29o@xmath12 , in which all the oxygens are four - coordinated .",
    "a detailed comparizon of the structure of rebaco@xmath12o@xmath13 with spinels , hexaferrites , perovskites and with ybafe@xmath12o@xmath13 ferrite was recently made by caignaert et al@xcite . in these structures , the fraction of bridgelike oxygen increases with increasing the fraction of large - size cations .",
    "like in the red mercury , in the perovskites , all the oxygens are bridgelike and the perovskites are reach by their famous soft modes .",
    "phase transitions known for the tetrahedral and octahedral networks are classified into displacive transitions and the transitions of the order - disorder type . in a simple model of double - well potential@xcite , the type of transition is determined by the relationship between energy of harmonic forces between neighboring atoms @xmath180 and the height of the barrier @xmath181 between two minima of the potential well .",
    "the degree of displaciveness for a transition is given by the parameter @xmath182 @xmath183 .",
    "we are in the displacive limit when @xmath184 and in the order - disorder limit when @xmath185 .",

    "there exist a well established relationship between the transition temperature and the angle of rotation of tetrahedra at 0 k : @xmath188 markina et al.@xcite and juarez - arellano et al.@xcite have reported nearly linear relationship between the value of @xmath14 in rebaco@xmath12o@xmath13 and the size of ionic radii of re .",

    "the inductive effect@xcite related to decreased covalence of re - o bonding with increasing the size of re would concern these o2 and o3 sites .    only remaining 14.3% oxygen sites ( o1-sites ) are not bound to re , as they are coordinated by four co. with respect to the covalent co - o bonding , a bridge - like ( o2 and o3 ) and tetrahedral ( o1 ) oxygen can be distinguished .",
    "the latter shows more ionic bonding and longer co - o bonds .",
    "all co ions are , in their turn , containing in their first coordination sphere three bridgelike oxygens and one tetrahedral oxygen .",
    "two types of ligands for each co presents the plausible argument to explain rather narrow lines of the symmetric doublet observed in the mssbauer spectra . in spite of the occurrence of four different sites for co in the low - temperature phase , the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "9 evidences the narrow distribution of efg over these sites .",
    "if we attribute the origin of efg to strong difference between the bridgelike and tetrahedral oxygen ligation , then the efg can be explained in terms of point charge model for the first coordination sphere .",
    "then due to the symmetry in high - temperature phase the efg on each of the co sites should be oriented along the longest co - o1 bonds for both co1 and co2 sites .",
    "the tetrahedra are non - ideal rigid bodies , therefore , in low - temperature phase each of three tetrahedra in kagom layer is distorted in its own manner .",
    "however , we observe only the change of @xmath8 within 3% .",
    "this is an important observation , which would let us to estimate whether or not the partial contribution of each ligand to efg depend on the bond angles . generally , upon variation of bond angles the partial contribution to efg  may change because fractional @xmath191character of the bonds changes@xcite .",
    "however , the families of compounds exist , in which the assumption of angle - independent partial contributions is a good approximation . one of such families includes , for example , brownmillerites and high-@xmath192 superconductors with `` 1212 '' structure@xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath192 cuprates , so different at first sight from brownmillerites , show very similar ligation for iron located at the midway between the cuprate planes@xcite .",
    "the quadrupole splitting is related to the  efg tensor main component @xmath193 and efg asymmetry @xmath194 via@xcite : @xmath195 here @xmath196 kev is the transition energy , and @xmath197 is the quadrupole moment of the excited state of the @xmath30fe nuclei . from the electric field gradient v@xmath198 in units of v",

    "the eq.(5 ) shows that the changes in @xmath8 signifies either variation of @xmath200 or variation of @xmath152 or both .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig_12.eps    the behavior of @xmath152 is well predictable in a vicinity of a second - order phase transition .",
    "displacive phase transitions are usually close to the continuous phase transitions , which are described though rigorously with renormalization group theory as first - order - like , in practice exhibit the size of first - order discontinuities so small as to be virtually unobservable@xcite . through the continuous phase transitions an empiric rule was established@xcite , which states that all three components of efg tensor depends linearly on a single control parameter . in other words ,",
    "the changes of principal component and asymmetry of efg tensor are correlated and both @xmath200 and @xmath152 vary continuously through such a transition .",
    "symmetry breaking obviously underlies this rule in a vicinity of axiality ( @xmath201 ) or antiaxiality ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig_13.eps    the non - trivial correlation between @xmath200 and @xmath152 is illustrated by the linear trajectories of the system in the so - called czjzek - plot , in which @xmath203 is plotted versus @xmath204@xcite .",
    "these axes are chosen to make use the intrinsic properties of the efg tensor , which is symmetric and traceless .",
    "therefore at the condition of antiaxiality ( at horizontal axis in czjzek plot , fig.12a ) , where @xmath200 changes its sign by definition , the system pass the line @xmath202 without refraction . on the other hand , at @xmath201",

    "the path tilted to the midway angle with the directions towards ( -@xmath213 and ( 7@xmath214 ) produces two @xmath209 curves with no extremum , but with sigmoidal shape having the inflexion again at @xmath210c .",
    "these two curves correspond to two opposite directions of increasing temperature along the same line indicated by arrows on czjzek - plot ( fig.12,a ) .",
    "next , we investigate the trajectory tilted to the angles intermediate between @xmath215 and 2@xmath216 as in the case of 2@xmath217 such a trajectory is reflected from the border of czjzek - plot , but now not at the right angle .",
