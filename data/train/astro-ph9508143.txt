    "the cobe experiment ( bennet et al . 1992 , 1994 ; smoot et al . 1992 ) has stimulated a considerable amount of work on cosmic structure .",
    "current tests usually exploit the angular correlation function and several harmonic amplitudes of the sky temperature field ( see e.g , adams et al .",
    "1992 ; kashlinsky 1992 ; efstathiou et al . 1992 ; kofmann et al . 1993 ; gorski et al . 1994 ) .",
    "however , several more tests have been suggested over the years for a thorough investigation of the properties of the anisotropy field of the cosmic background radiation .",
    "these often involve the distribution and features of hot and cold spots , which can provide useful checks of the gaussian nature of the fluctuations ( sazhin 1985 ; bond & efstathiou 1987 ; coles & barrow 1987 ; coles 1988 ; martnez - gonzlez & sanz 1989 ; gott et al .",
    "measurable quantities include the number of spots @xmath3 defined by isotemperature contours , the spot boundary curvature or genus @xmath4 , the spot excursion area , and so on .",
    "a first analysis of cobe - dmr maps along these lines has been performed by torres ( 1994 ) .",
    "a definition of spots independent of isotemperature contours considers local maxima and minima of temperature ( bond & efstathiou 1987 , vittorio & juszkiewicz 1987 ) , and is thereby not connected to the topological features of spots .",
    "differing from @xmath5 the dependence of the number of ( positive and/or negative ) peaks @xmath6 on threshold is not universal for gaussian fields .",
    "this latter approach was adopted by fabbri & natale ( 1993 , 1995 ) in studies of the 2-dimensional distribution of extragalactic iras sources , but has not yet been applied to the cosmic background radiation .    in this work",
    "we analyze the statistics of local maxima and minima in cobe - dmr 2-year maps .",
    "we found that in this kind of analysis the detector noise must be taken into account very carefully since @xmath6 is sensitive also to high order harmonics where noise dominates ( cf .",
    "fabbri 1992 ) .",
    "however , due to a highly nonlinear dependence of @xmath6 on the harmonic strengths , the presence of structured signals in cobe maps reduces its value below the level measured in pure noise maps . ( the identification of genuine peaks in the radiation temperature is not required at all in our analysis . )",
    "we find that the distributions of positive and negative peaks are mutually consistent , and the results from this statistics agree with those of earlier tests .",
    "therefore , we find no evidence for non - gaussian features in the fluctuations .",
    "more precisely , fitting gaussian power - law models of cosmic structure to the peak distribution we recover a clear anticorrelation between the spectral index @xmath7 and the predicted rms quadrupole @xmath8 ( seljak & bertschinger 1993 ; smoot et al .",
    "1994 ) : we get @xmath9 @xmath10k for @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13k for @xmath14 , where the error bars include uncertainties deriving from the treament of noise as well as cosmic variance . these numbers , altough they agree with previous evaluations of the quadrupole from higher order harmonics , are not consistent with its direct determination providing @xmath15 @xmath10k ( bennet et al .",
    "so the recently discovered discrepancy is confirmed by the properties of the peak distribution , which depend on the harmonic content of the angular distribution up to @xmath16",
    "we analyzed the 2-year 53(a+b ) dmr maps processed with a 2.9@xmath17 smoothing ( wright et al .",
    "1993 ) and dipole subtraction . considering the northern and southern hemispheres separately",
    ", we constructed two pole - centered maps , each containing 12892 pixels , using the coordinate transformation @xmath18 , $ ] @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the galactic coordinates . after masking low galactic latitudes , @xmath22 we were left with 8412 pixels per map .",
    "we then looked for temperature peaks using the algorithms of fabbri & natale ( 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "table 1 gives the no - threshold numbers of peaks , both actually detected and extrapolated to the entire sky and to the north and south hemispheres ( 2nd and 3rd column , respectively ) .",
    "figure 1 reports the extrapolated numbers vs. a threshold factor @xmath23 .",
    "this is the peak height normalized to the sky rms fluctuation @xmath24 ; for cold spots , @xmath6 gives the number of minima below @xmath25 . for distributions of only positive _ or",
    "_ negative peaks the statistical errors at 1-sigma confidence levels are evaluated as @xmath26 with @xmath27 the unmasked fraction of the sky . within such error limits",
    ", we find no significant difference between the distributions of positive and negative peaks ; this result provides support for the gaussian nature of cosmic perturbations . in the figure we also report the full - sky average number of positive and negative peaks",
    "this average will be compared with theoretical models below , because of the smaller ( by a factor @xmath28 relative error .",
    "llll peak set & @xmath29 maps & @xmath29 maps & @xmath30 maps + & @xmath31 & extrapolated@xmath32 & no mask + hot , north & 50 & @xmath33 & 95 + cold , north & 47 & @xmath34 & 99 + hot , south & 48 & @xmath35 & 105 + cold , south & 53 & @xmath36 & 97 + hot , total & 98 & @xmath37 & 200 + cold , total & 100 & @xmath38 & 196 + hot / cold average & 99 & @xmath39 & 198 +      for the interpretation of the above data , we must consider that both cosmic signal and noise contribute to the temperature field @xmath40 .",

    "assuming that signal and noise are uncorrelated , their contributions to @xmath49 add up in quadrature in the ( a+b ) maps , @xmath50 , and we need to determine @xmath51 in an independent way .",
    "this can be achieved by means of the ( a@xmath52b ) maps , which can however be used to directly derive the coefficients @xmath53 rather than the @xmath51 .",
    "figure 2 reports the results of a harmonic best fit up to @xmath54 executed on the entire celestial sphere@xmath55 increasing the number of harmonics , best fits ( as well as direct integration by means of @xmath56 ) tend to overrate large-@xmath57 amplitudes .",
    "we checked for this effect by considering the peak statistics for noise maps .",
    "figure 3 gives the numbers of maxima and minima detected in the full - sky noise maps vs. threshold @xmath58 if using eq.s ( [ npeak]-[gammastar ] ) we generate the peak statistics from a set of 50 harmonics with best - fitted amplitudes , we get a low - threshold excess of about 30 peaks with respect to the data in fig .",
    "2 ; the discrepancy increases with the number of harmonics .",
    "since accurate theoretical calculations of peak statistics require at least @xmath5950 harmonics , we tried to fit an analytic form to a more limited set of @xmath60 .",
    "a satisfactory choice is @xmath61 .\\ ] ] however the large error bars on individual @xmath60 make a 2-parameter fit for the function ( [ anoise ] ) not very useful .",
    "a more convenient solution to this problem is to fit the parameter @xmath62 directly on the noise - generated peak distribution ; using the average distribution of maxima and minima ( represented by the filled circles in figure 3 ) and 99 harmonics the result is @xmath63 ( we checked however that a set of @xmath64 harmonics would provide a sufficient accuracy . )",
    "the fit turns out to be even `` too '' good , providing @xmath65 against 9 degrees of freedom : this means that data points at different thresholds are not uncorrelated .",
    "the value found for @xmath66 is quite independent of @xmath67 , since peak statistics does not depend on the overall amplitude of anisotropies as shown by eq.s ( [ tetastar ] , [ gammastar]).we then fitted the amplitude parameter of eq .",

    "the peak distributions calculated from eq.s ( [ npeak]-[gammastar ] ) are tested against the averaged distribution of positive and negative peaks .",
    "we should notice that such theoretical distribution are affected by several sources of uncertainty .",
    "cosmic variance ( white et al . 1993 ) affects the cosmic - structure contribution to the harmonic coefficients @xmath82 , and a quite similar variance pertains to noise ; in fact , these two effects are described by identical equations assuming that both are gaussian processes . performing a limited number of simulations for superpositions of gaussian signal and noise ( with fixed @xmath83 , the _ expectation _ values of harmonic strengths )",

    "contours calculated for @xmath94 ( case s29 , not reported in the figure ) would be hardly distinguishable from them . using the analytic form ( [ anoise ] ) in the entire range @xmath95 ( case f31 ) the contours",
