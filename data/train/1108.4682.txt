    "even though stellar intensity interferometry ( sii ) was abandoned in the 1970 s , there has been a recent interest in reviving this technique , mainly due to the unprecedented @xmath1 plane coverage that future imaging air cherenkov telescope ( iact ) arrays will provide @xcite .",
    "the possibility of probing stars at the sub - milliarcsecond scale and visible wavelengths has motivated new developments in instrumentation and simulations , the latter being the focus of this paper . +",
    "recent results obtained with amplitude ( michelson ) interferometry have started to reveal stars as extended objects ( e.g. @xcite ) , and with non - uniform light intensity distributions in the milliarcsecond scale .",
    "such interesting results can be further investigated with sii taking advantage of the longer ( km ) baselines and relative ease of observing at shorter ( blue ) wavelengths .",
    "for example , measuring stellar diameters at different wavelengths , will make it possible to further investigate the wavelength dependence of limb darkening , @xcite and thus constrain stellar atmosphere models .",
    "radii measurements with uncertainties of a few percent , along with spectroscopic measurements are necessary to constrain the position of stars in the hr diagram ( e.g. @xcite ) . with the methods described in this paper ,",
    "we show that diameters can in principle be measured with accuracies better than @xmath2 when using realistic array configurations for future experiments such as cta ( cherenkov telescope array ) . as another example we can consider fast rotating",
    "b stars , which are ideal candidates for imaging oblateness , pole brightening @xcite , radiatively driven mass loss @xcite , and perhaps even pulsation modes @xcite .",
    "the impact of rotation on stellar evolution is non - trivial , and several studies have been made in the subject ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "images of rotating stars have become available in the past few years ( e.g. @xcite ) , and measurements of oblateness with accuracies of a few percent have been made .",
    "we will show that this is comparable to what can be achieved with sii using large arrays of cherenkov telescopes .",
    "there is also the case of interacting binaries , for which we can measure angular separation , diameters , and relative brightness . it may even be possible to measure mass transfer @xcite",
    ". measurements of the angular separation in binaries is crucial for determining the masses of stars .",
    "these masses must be found to within @xmath3 @xcite in order to test main sequence models . with the methods described in this paper , we show that angular separations can be found to within a few percent from reconstructed images",
    ". a more convenient and accurate analysis ( beyond the scope of this paper ) does not require imaging , and should yield sub - percent uncertainties , so that testing main sequence models will become possible with sii .",
    "+ in preparation for a large - scale sii observatory deployment , several laboratory experiments are in progress @xcite .",
    "their main goal is to measure light intensity correlation between two receivers .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the _ star base _",
    "observatory ( located in grantsville , utah ) which consists of two @xmath4 light receivers separated by @xmath5 and which will be used to test high time resolution digital correlators , and to measure the second order degree of coherence for a few stars .",
    "various analog and digital correlator technologies @xcite are being implemented , and cross correlation of streams of photons with nanosecond - scale resolution has already been achieved .",
    "+ intensity interferometry , unlike amplitude interferometry , relies on the correlation between intensity fluctuations averaged over the spectral band at electronic ( nanosecond ) time resolution .",
    "these averaged fluctuations are much slower than the ( femtosecond ) light wave period .",
    "this correlation is directly related to the complex degree of coherence @xmath6 as @xcite    @xmath7    here , @xmath8 is the time average of the intensity received at a particular telescope @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the intensity fluctuation . measuring a second - order effect results in lower signal - to - noise ratio when compared to amplitude interferometry @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity issue can be dealt with by using large light collection areas ( such as those available with air cherenkov telescopes ) , longer exposure times and baseline redundancy .",
    "the low frequency fluctuation can be interpreted classically as the beat formed by neighboring fourier components .",
    "since sii relies on low frequency fluctuations , which are typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the frequency of optical light , it does not rely on the phase difference between light waves , but rather in the difference between the relative phases of the two components at the detectors @xcite .",
    "the main advantage is the relative insensitivity to atmospheric turbulence and the absence of a requirement for sub - wavelength precision in the optics and delay lines @xcite .",
    "the complex mutual degree of coherence @xmath11 is proportional to the fourier transform of the radiance distribution of the object in the sky ( van cittert - zernike theorem ) .",
    "however , since with sii , the squared - modulus of @xmath11 is the measurable quantity , the main disadvantage is that the phase of the fourier transform is lost in the measurement process .",
    "the loss of phase information poses a severe difficulty , and images have in the past been reconstructed from the bispectrum technique , using monolithic apertures ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the imaging limitations can be overcome using a model - independent phase recovery technique .",
    "even though several phase reconstruction techniques exist @xcite , we concentrate on a two dimensional version of the one dimensional analysis introduced by @xcite , which is based on the theory of analytic functions , and in particular the cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "+ following recent successes in gamma ray astronomy , a next generation cherenkov telescope array is in a preparatory stage .",
    "this project is currently known as cta ( cherenkov telescope array ) @xcite , and will contain between 50 and 100 telescopes with apertures ranging between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the sensitivity and imaging capabilities of sii implemented on such an atmospheric cherenkov telescope array .",
    "we start with a discussion of sensitivity ( section [ sensitivity ] ) , followed by a discussion of simulating noisy data as would be realistically obtained with such an array ( section [ simulation ] ) .",
    "since data have a finite sampling in the @xmath1 plane , we discuss our method of fitting an analytic function to the data in order to estimate derivatives which are needed for phase reconstruction ( section [ fit ] ) .",
    "we then briefly discuss phase recovery ( section [ phase_rec_sec ] ) and proceed to quantify the reconstruction quality using several criteria .",
    "we start with the simple case of uniform disks ( section [ disks ] ) and progressively increase the degree of image complexity by including oblateness ( section [ oblate_sec ] ) , binary stars ( section [ binary_sec ] ) , and obscuring disks and spots ( section [ complex ] ) .",
    "the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) for an intensity correlation measurement depends on the degree of correlation @xmath11 , the area @xmath14 of each of the light receivers , the spectral density @xmath15 ( number of photons per unit area per unit time , per frequency ) , the quantum efficiency @xmath16 , the electronic bandwidth @xmath17 , and the observation time @xmath18 .",
    "the snr can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath19    the spectral density @xmath15 is related to the visual magnitude @xmath20 of the star as well as its temperature @xmath21 and observing wavelength @xmath22 .",
    "the spectral density @xmath23 is the number of black body photons per unit area , per unit frequency and per unit time .",
    "the dependence of the visual magnitude @xmath20 is found by recalling that the flux for a @xmath24 magnitude star with a temperature of @xmath25 observed at @xmath26 is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this in turn corresponds to a spectral density of @xmath28 .",
    "the spectral density as a function of temperature ( for different visual magnitudes and observing wavelengths ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ n_vs_t ] , and we see that at constant visual magnitude and observing wavelength , higher temperatures correspond to higher spectral densities .",
    "we find that the increase in temperature @xmath29 is approximately @xmath30 for the range of temperatures and wavelengths considered in fig .",
    "[ n_vs_t ] .",
    "for example , at @xmath31 , a decrease of 1 visual magnitude is equivalent to increasing the temperature of the star from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "for this reason high temperature objects are easier targets for sii .",
    "+    we use a preliminary design of the cta project as an array configuration @xcite , which is shown in fig .",

    "this array contains @xmath34 telescopes and @xmath35 baselines ( many of which are redundant ) which are shown in fig .",

    "the smallest @xmath41 baselines of @xmath42 resolve angular scales of @xmath43 .",
    "however , we show in section [ disks ] , that the largest angular scales that can be realistically _ imaged _ with our analysis , in a model independent way , are more determined by baselines of @xmath44 .",
    "this is because the estimation of derivatives of the phase ( needed for phase recovery ) degrades as the number of baselines is reduced .",
    "baselines of @xmath45 resolve angular scales of @xmath46 at @xmath31 .",
    "+    these order - of - magnitude considerations are taken into account when performing simulations and image reconstructions , i.e. the minimum and maximum size of pristine images that can be reconstructed by data analysis , do not go far beyond these limits .",
    "more precise array resolution limits are presented in section [ disks ] ( diameters ranging between @xmath47 ) . by combining these angular scales with the snr ( eq . [ snr ] ) ,",

    "the original `` pristine '' image consists of @xmath66 pixels corresponding to @xmath67 of angular extension and a wavelength of @xmath68 .",
    "the fourier transform of the image is then performed via an fft algorithm and normalized so that its value is one at zero baseline .",

    "there are situations where data are more easily fit with a different set of basis functions , e.g. a binary with unresolved members . in such a situation , data do not rapidly tend to zero at large baselines , so the hermite function fit may contain a large number of elements and result in high frequency noise where data are scarce .",
    "the best choice of basis functions may therefore depend on the structure of the object .",
    "however , for consistency , we use the hermite fit for all the objects that we analyze , and find that it gives reasonably good results .",
    "+ the @xmath78 minimization problem can be turned into a linear system by setting the set of partial derivatives @xmath83 to zero .",

    "since the image is real , the fourier magnitude is symmetric with respect to the origin in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "lack of phase information results in the reconstructed image being arbitrary up to a translation and reflection .",
    "we discuss the one - dimensional phase reconstruction prior to developing the two - dimensional analysis .",

    "then it becomes convenient to express the discrete fourier transform in phasor representation , i.e. @xmath88 where @xmath89 is complex . since the discrete fourier transform is a polynomial in @xmath90 ,",

    "since the phase differences are known along the radial direction in the complex plane we can take radial differences of the general solution and then fit the log - magnitude differences ( available from the data ) to the radial differences of the general solution .",
    "+ we can think of this one - dimensional reconstruction as a phase estimation along a single slice in the fourier plane .",
    "a generalization to two dimensions can be made by doing the same procedure for several slices as described in fig .",

    "+ one can also require that the phase at a particular point in the complex plane be exactly equal when reconstructed along @xmath97 or @xmath98 since each reconstruction is arbitrary up to a constant ( piston ) and a linear term ( tip / tilt ) .",

    "for example : a non - resolved binary star with one component 20 times brighter that the other , has relative variations of @xmath137 .",
    "with all the redundant baselines , a few percent uncertainty in the measured degree of correlation is sufficient to accurately measure these variations .",
    "however , when the binary components are resolved , the relative variations decrease with increasing baseline and baseline redundancy is not sufficient to reduce the uncertainty in the measurement of the fourier magnitude . this signal to noise issue can of course be improved by increasing exposure time .",
    "+ there are also issues related to algorithm performance .",
    "one such problem has to do with the fit of the data to an analytic function ( see section [ fit ] ) .",
    "when the scale of the fit ( found by an initial gauss fit ) is found to be too small , too many basis elements are used to reconstruct the data , and high frequency artifacts appear in reconstructions .",
    "small initial scales are typically related to the binary separation as opposed to the size of individual components , and it is the latter which correctly sets the scale of the fit .",
    "artifacts may be then mistaken for binary components , and incorrect reconstructed parameters may be found .",
    "results improve significantly when either the correct scale is set or ( model - independent ) image post - processing is performed ( see section [ mira ] ) .",
    "we now present two examples of more complex images , and show that the capabilities can , to a large extent , be understood from results of less complex images , such as uniform disks and binaries . in fig .",
    "[ horizontal_disk ] we show the reconstruction of a star with a dark band ( obscuring disk ) , corresponding to a @xmath140 magnitude star and 10 hrs of observation time .",
    "the metric used to quantify the agreement with the pristine image ( bottom left corner of fig .",
    "[ horizontal_disk ] ) is a normalized correlation and @xmath141 , the normalized correlation @xmath142 is @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the standard deviations of images @xmath14 and @xmath146 .",
    "] whose absolute value ranges between 0 ( no correlation ) and 1 ( perfect correlation / anti - correlation ) . to quantify the uncertainty in the correlation",
    ", we perform the noisy simulation and reconstruction several times , and find the standard deviation of the degree of correlation . in the case of fig .",
    "[ horizontal_disk ] , the correlation @xmath147 is @xmath148 .",
    "note that the uncertainty in the correlation is apparently small , and the image reconstruction is not perfect , which implies that the reconstruction is not only affected by the snr level , but also by the reconstruction algorithm performance .",
    "+ in order to determine the confidence with which we can detect the feature ( dark region within the disk ) , this correlation is compared to the correlation of the reconstruction , and a featureless image , i.e. a uniform disk whose radius matches the radius of the pristine image .",
    "this comparison allows us to quantify the confidence with which we actually detect the feature ( dark spot ) .",
    "consequently , the correlation of the reconstructed image with a uniform disk is @xmath149 , which is lower by 61 standard deviations .",
    "+ another example of a complex image reconstruction can be seen in fig .",
    "[ dark_spot ] . here",
    "we show the reconstruction of a star with a dark spot , whose correlation with the pristine image is @xmath150 .",
    "we can compare this correlation with the correlation of the reconstructed image and a uniform disk , which is @xmath151 ( lower by 30 standard deviations ) .",
    "+    for both examples , we also calculate the correlation with the pristine image as a function of the angular scale ( in @xmath152 ) of the pristine image .",
    "we then find the degree of correlation of each reconstruction and its pristine image , and also the degree of correlation of the reconstruction with a uniform disk . by comparing these two correlation values , we can find the smallest feature that can be reconstructed .",
    "below some point we no longer distinguish between the reconstruction of the featured image and that of a uniform disk .",
    "we find that the smallest feature that can be reconstructed is close to @xmath153 .",
    "this can already be seen from the order of magnitude estimate made in section [ sensitivity ] and a comparable value of @xmath49 is found in section [ disks ] .",
    "when pristine images have angular sizes greater than @xmath154 , the degree of correlation drops significantly due to lack of short baselines .",
    "note that this value is higher than what is found in section [ disks ] .",
    "this is due to higher signal to noise ratio in the simulated data corresponding to figures [ horizontal_disk ] and [ dark_spot ] .",
    "the resolution limits discussed in turn correspond to @xmath155 effective resolution elements ( pixels ) .",
    "+      image post - processing is performed in order to improve the raw images presented above .",
    "the type of post - processing that is currently being investigated is analogous to the data analysis performed in conventional amplitude interferometry . in this analysis , the image",
    "is slightly modified so as to maximize the agreement between the data and the magnitude of the fourier transform of the reconstructed image .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "also , one can introduce additional and very general constraints to this maximization procedure , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "such an analysis depends strongly on the starting image , which can be provided by the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "an example of image post - processing performed on the oblate star of fig .",
    "[ oblate_example_c ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ improved_oblate ] .",
    "+    we have performed this type of post - processing on the images in figures [ horizontal_disk ] and [ dark_spot ] using the mira software @xcite , and we obtain the ones shown in figures [ mira_image_a ] and [ mira_image_b ] . aside from optimizing agreement with the data , no additional constraints are imposed .",
    "these preliminary results show the overall reduction in noise and improvement in the sharpness of the reconstructed images .",
    "a systematic study of the improvements with image post - processing is currently being investigated @xcite .",
    "we perform a simulation study of the imaging capabilities at @xmath31 of an iact array consisting of 97 telescopes separated up to a @xmath156 .",
    "this is a preliminary design for the cta project , expected to be operational in 2018 .",
    "our method uses a model - independent algorithm to recover the phase from intensity interferometric data .",
    "we test the method on images of increasing degrees of complexity , parameterizing the pristine image , and comparing the reconstructed parameter with the pristine parameter .",
    "we now summarize our results and briefly discuss how fundamental stellar parameters can be constrained with the methods described above .",
    "+ we first find that for bright disk - like stars ( @xmath157 ) , radii are well reconstructed from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . even though using a cauchy - riemann based approach to recover images might not be the most efficient way to measure stellar radii , such a study starts to quantify the abilities of measuring other scale parameters in more complicated images ( oblateness , distance between binary components , etc . ) .",
    "the range of angular radii that can be measured with a cta - like array ( @xmath158 ) will complement existing measurements ( @xmath159 ) @xcite . with the aid of photometry , the effective temperature , where @xmath82 is the radius , @xmath160 is the luminosity , and @xmath161 is the stephan - boltzmann constant . ]",
    "scale of stars within @xmath162 can be extended .",
    "multi - wavelength angular diameter measurements will also reveal the wavelength dependence of limb - darkening @xcite , and such measurements can be used to constrain energy transport models as is done in amplitude interferometry @xcite . + for oblate stars , similar results for extracting geometrical parameters are found . due to the relative ease of sii to observe at short ( @xmath163 ) wavelengths , measuring fundamental parameters of hot b type stars is possible .",
    "b stars are particularly interesting since rapid rotation , oblateness , and mass loss are a common feature .",
    "we show that oblateness can be accurately measured , and a next step will be to quantify the capabilities of imaging realistic surface brightness distributions in hot stars . by imaging brightness ( temperature ) distributions , we will be able to study effects such as limb darkening and mass loss in hot massive stars @xcite , as well as gravity darkening @xcite . +",
    "binary stars are well reconstructed when one of the members is not much brighter ( three times as bright ) than the other , and when they are not too far apart ( @xmath164 ) . as with amplitude interferometry , sii ,",
    "along with spectroscopy , will allow the determination masses and orbital parameters in binary stars .",
    "if measured with enough precision ( @xmath165 ) @xcite , the determination of the mass can be used to test main sequence stellar models .",
    "an advantage of using an array such as the one used in this study , is that individual radii can be resolved .",
    "an interesting phenomena to be studied with interacting binary stars is mass transfer ( e.g. @xcite ) , and capabilities for imaging this phenomena can be further investigated .",
    "+ two examples of reconstructions of more complex images are presented , and demonstrate the capability to resolve features in the sub - milliarcsecond scale .",
    "results show improvement when post - processing is performed .",
    "an optimization procedure improves the image reconstructions found by the methods presented above by maximizing their agreement with the data .",
    "a more comprehensive study of reconstructions of complex images is currently being performed .",
    "recall that since sii can only allow to measure @xmath166 , the phase information is lost , and we would like to recover it for imaging purposes , with only the magnitude information .",
    "if we denote @xmath88 , where @xmath167 , we obtain the following relations from the cauchy - riemann equations :      where we have defined @xmath169 as the log - magnitude .",
    "notice the relation between the magnitude and the phase .",
    "by using the cauchy - riemann equations we can write the log - magnitude differences along the real and imaginary axes as :      if the log - magnitude were available along purely the @xmath171 or the @xmath91 axes , we could solve the previous two equations for the phase .",
    "+ however , notice that because @xmath172 , we can only measure the log - magnitude on the unit circle in the complex space ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "+ in general , we can write the log - magnitude differences along the unit circle as      here @xmath175 corresponds to phase differences along a direction perpendicular to @xmath176 , that is , perpendicular to the unit circle in the @xmath177 plane .",
    "we are however interested in obtaining @xmath178 , so that we can integrate along the unit circle .",
    "+ the general form of @xmath179 can be found by taking second derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ cauchy ] ) and thus noting that @xmath179 is a solution of the laplace equation in the complex plane .          where terms singular at the origin ( @xmath184 ) have been omitted .",
    "these singular terms lead to ambiguous reconstructions including flipped images and have not been found to be essential for most reconstructions . + now taking the difference of @xmath179 along the radial direction we obtain      note from eq .",
    "( [ path ] ) that the length in the complex plane associated with @xmath176 is @xmath186 , and that the length associated with @xmath187 is @xmath188 . now setting @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and for simplicity of presentation , expanding for small @xmath191",
    ", we obtain      so now the coefficients @xmath193 and @xmath194 can be found using equations ( [ path0]-[path ] ) from the measured @xmath176 , and thus @xmath179 can be found in the complex plane , with an uncertainty in @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath193 and @xmath194 can be calculated by performing the following integrals :        note however that the previous expressions must exist , which is not the general case .",
    "more explicitly , if the magnitude is zero , the log - magnitude is singular . when imaging finite objects in image space , there will always be zeros in the magnitude of the fourier transform . in practice",
    "we are always sample limited and nothing prevents us from calculating @xmath193 and @xmath194 approximately .",
