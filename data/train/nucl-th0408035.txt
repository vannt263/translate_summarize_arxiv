    "the development of the nuclear shell model has been one of the keys for a microscopic understanding of nuclear structure .",
    "therefore a lot of effort has been made to deduce the properties of the mean field of nucleons in nuclei from realistic models of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction .",
    "the simple hartree - fock approach fails badly if one employs realistic nn interactions , i.e. interactions which are adjusted to describe the nn scattering data : such hartree fock calculations typically yield unbound nuclei and no binding energy for nuclear matter at saturation density .",
    "this demonstrates the necessity to account for the effects of correlations , which are induced from the strong short - range components and the tensor components of realistic nn forces .",
    "therefore various methods for treating strongly interacting many fermion systems have been developed and applied to account for these correlation effects ( see e.g.@xcite and @xcite for a review on this topic ) .",
    "one of the most popular approaches in nuclear physics has been the hole - line expansion and in particular the lowest order approach in this expansion , the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approximation .",
    "like the ordinary hartree - fock approach also the bhf approximation assumes a slater - determinant for the nuclear wave function and the effects of correlations are taken into account by means of an effective interaction , the so - called @xmath0 matrix .",
    "this @xmath0 matrix is obtained from solving the bethe - goldstone equation , which in some sense corresponds to the nn scattering @xmath1 matrix .",
    "in contrast to the lippmann - schwinger equation , leading to @xmath1 , the bethe - goldstone equation accounts for effects of the nuclear medium : the propagator for the intermediate two - particle states is restricted to particle states , i.e. to single - particle states with energies above the fermi energy @xmath2 , and is defined in terms of the single - particle energies for the nucleons in the medium .",
    "therefore the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation , the @xmath0 matrix accounts for particle - particle ladders .",
    "the single - particle energies are determined from the hartree - fock approximation for the nucleon self - energy or single - particle potential , however , replacing the bare nn interaction by the effective interaction , the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "this @xmath0 matrix is also used to determine the total energy of the system .",
    "the bhf approximation may also be considered as a first step towards a many - body approach , which is based on a a self - consistent evaluation of green s function@xcite . within the scheme of self - consistent green s function ,",
    "however , the evaluation of the self - energy is done employing a scattering matrix for two nucleons in the medium , which accounts for particle - particle as well as hole - hole ladders . in nuclear physics",
    "typical values for the fermi momentum are small compared to the single - particle momenta which can be reached by nn scattering processes employing realistic nn forces . therefore the contributions of the particle - particle ladder terms are more important than those of the hole - hole terms , which provides a justification for the approximation used in the hole line expansion .",
    "therefore the main advantage of the self - consistent green s function approach is not the inclusion of hole - hole terms in the effective nn scattering matrix but that it yields a consistent result for the single - particle green function , which can be analyzed to determine the spectral functions of nucleons in the nuclear medium .",
    "these spectral functions directly reflect the effects of the nn correlations and can be explored by the analysis of nucleon knock - out experiments like @xmath3 .",
    "various attempts have been made to perform self - consistent calculations of the green s function for nucleons in nuclear matter using realistic nn forces .",
    "a serious problem of those investigations is the appearance of the so - called pairing instability@xcite .",
    "such pairing effects can be taken into account by means of the bcs approach@xcite . at the empirical saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter",
    "the solution of the gap equation in the @xmath4 partial wave leads to an energy gap of around 10 mev .",
    "another approach is to consider an evaluation of the generalized ladder diagrams with `` dressed '' single - particle propagators .",
    "this means that the single - particle green s functions are not approximated by a mean - field approach but consider single - particle strength distributed over all energies .",
    "various attempts have been made in this direction , considering a parameterization of the single - particle green s function in terms of various poles@xcite , employing simplified ( separable ) interaction models@xcite or considering the case of finite temperature@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the same instabilities have also been observed in studies of finite nuclei@xcite , leading to divergent contributions to the binding energy from the generalized ring diagrams .",
    "these contributions remain finite if the single - particle propagator are dressed in a self - consistent way .",
    "an approximative scheme for the self - consistent evaluation of the single - particle green s function has been developed and applied to symmetric nuclear matter in @xcite . in this approach",
    "the @xmath0 matrix is evaluated avoiding the angle - average approximation for two - nucleon propagator which is usually considered .",
    "the effects of the hole - hole scattering terms are taken into account by means of a perturbative approach and the single - particle propagator are approximated by a single - pole approach , deriving the energy of the pole from the energy weighted spectral distribution .",
    "it has been shown that this approach yields results for the spectral function , which are in good agreement with a determination in a complete self - consistent green s function approach . however , it underestimates the hole strength at very high momenta and missing energies@xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we present an approximation scheme close to the one developed in @xcite and apply it to asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the main aim of this study is to explore the dependence of the spectral functions for protons and neutrons on the nuclear asymmetry and relate this to the correlations induced by the proton - proton ( neutron - neutron ) and proton - neutron interaction .",
    "since the tensor components of the nn interaction are suppressed in the proton - proton and neutron - neutron interaction , this analysis shall also allow us to distinguish the correlation effects originating from the tensor components from those induced by the central short - range components of the nn interaction .",
    "the dependence of these results on the model for the nn interaction is explored by comparing the results derived from two modern nn interactions , which fit nn phase shifts with high accuracy .",
    "one of them , the so - called nijm2 interaction , is a localized version of the nijmegen interaction@xcite .",
    "the other one , the cd - bonn potential , is defined in momentum space and no attempt is made to localize it@xcite .    after this introduction",
    "we will shortly review the scheme to evaluate the spectral function within the green s function approach .",
    "results will be presented in section 3 including a discussion of the usual angle - average approximations for the nn propagator in the scattering equation .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",

    "this pauli operator as well as the single - particle energies for the intermediate states are defined in terms of the single - particle momenta @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "often , however , one uses a parameterization of the single - particle spectra in terms of an effective mass in the form @xmath28 this parameterization allows the definition of a so - called angle - averaged propagator , which reduces the bethe - goldstone equation to an integral equation in one dimension , to be solved for various partial waves . in our calculations",
    "we avoid this angle average procedure and solve the bethe goldstone equation with the exact propagator using the techniques discussed in @xcite .    in a next step",

    "this means that in the calculation of the self - energy we account for the fact that the spectral strength is distributed over a wide range of energies and consider the mean value of the distribution .",
    "this leads to an energy spectrum exhibiting a small gap at @xmath48 .",
    "this gap is of similar size as the pairing gap obtained in bcs calculations . with this choice",
    "we circumvent the problems of the pairing instabilities .",
    "however , in calculating the terms of the self - energy we do not consider a depletion of the occupation for momenta @xmath39 below the fermi momentum and partial occupation of states with momenta @xmath39 larger than @xmath49 .",

    "as a first step we would like to discuss the self - energies or single - particle potentials as a function of the asymmetry of nuclear matter . for that purpose",
    "we consider nuclear matter at the empirical value for the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath12 = 0.17 @xmath51 ) and consider the self - energies for various values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath13 .",

    "this reflects the fact that the effective interaction is more attractive between protons and neutrons than between nucleons of the same isospin . for the cd - bonn interaction",
    "this feature can be observed to some extent already on the level of the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",

    "[ fig : epsi1 ] . using the hf approximation , however , the nijm2 interaction yields much less attractive self energies , ranging from 52 mev to -8 mev and in this case the self - energy is more attractive for the neutrons than for the protons .",
    "this is already a first indication for the differences between the two interactions considered : the local interaction nijm2 is stiffer than the non - local cd - bonn potential .",
    "therefore a larger part of the attraction in the effective interaction originates from the particle - particle ladder contributions to the @xmath0-matrix .",

    "<S> the self - energy of nucleons in asymmetric nuclear matter is evaluated employing different realistic models for the nucleon - nucleon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the brueckner hartree fock approximation without the usual angle - average in the two - nucleon propagator the effects of the hole - hole contributions are investigated within the self - consistent green s function approach . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to the isospin - dependence of correlations , which can be deduced from the spectral functions of nucleons in asymmetric matter . </S>",
    "<S> the strong components of the proton - neutron interaction lead in neutron - rich matter to a larger depletion for the occupation probability of proton states below the fermi momentum . </S>"
