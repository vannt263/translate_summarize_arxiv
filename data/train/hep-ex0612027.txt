    "high energy experiments have provided clear evidence for significant contributions of gluons to hadronic structure .",
    "evidence for gluons has been found in jet measurements and deep inelastic scattering .",
    "however , descriptions of gluonic degrees of freedom in the low energy regime of soft gluons are still unavailable .",
    "this description is necessary to better understand the detailed nature of confinement .",
    "the nature of this mechanism is one of the great mysteries of modern physics , and in order to shed light on this phenomenon , we must better understand the nature of the gluon and its role in the hadronic spectrum .",
    "confinement within the theory of strongly interacting matter , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , arises from the postulate that gluons can interact among themselves and give rise to detectable signatures within the hadronic spectrum .",
    "these signatures are expected within hadrons known as hybrids , where the gluonic degree of freedom is excited and can provide for a more detailed understanding of the confinement mechanism in qcd .",
    "gluonic mesons represent a @xmath0 system in which the gluonic flux - tube contributes directly to the quantum numbers of the state . in terms of the constituent quark model ,",
    "the quantum numbers of the meson are determined solely from the quark and antiquark .",
    "however , qcd indicates that this simple picture is incomplete .",
    "lattice qcd calculations predict that hybrid states with the flux - tube carrying angular momentum should exist , as well as purely gluonic states ( called glueballs ) .",
    "modern lattice calculations for mesons show that indeed a string - like chromoelectric flux - tube forms between distant static quark charges as shown in fig .",
    "the non - perturbative nature of the flux - tube leads to the confinement of the quarks and to the well - known linear inter - quark potential from heavy - quark confinement with @xmath1  gev / fm ( see fig .  [",
    "these calculations predict that the lowest lying hybrid meson states are roughly 1  gev more massive than the conventional meson states .",
    "this provides a reference point for the mass range to which experiments must be sensitive .",
    "within the standard non - relativistic constituent quark model , conventional mesons are made up from @xmath0 pairs with the spin 1/2 quarks coupled to a total spin @xmath2=0 or 1 .",
    "these pairs are then coupled with units of orbital angular momentum @xmath3 , and a possible radial excitation .",
    "the relevant quantum numbers to describe these states for a given principal quantum number @xmath4 are @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents the total angular momentum , @xmath7 represents the intrinsic parity , and @xmath8 represents the @xmath9-parity of the state .",
    "the light - quark mesons are built up from @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 quarks and their antiquarks .",
    "for each value of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , a nonet of mesons is expected for each value of @xmath5 .",
    "the lowest possible mass states for these conventional mesons ( i.e. for @xmath3=0 , @xmath4=1 ) are then @xmath13 for @xmath2=0 ( corresponding to the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 mesons ) and @xmath18 for @xmath2=1 ( corresponding to the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 mesons ) .",
    "the lowest lying @xmath2=0 mesons have masses of about 500  mev and the lowest lying @xmath2=1 mesons have masses of about 800  mev .",
    "nonets of higher mass mesons for a given principal quantum number are then built up by adding in units of @xmath3 .",
    "conventional mesons correspond to states with the flux - tube in its ground state , and as such , the gluonic degree of freedom does not contribute .    the hybrid meson quantum numbers can be predicted within the flux - tube model  @xcite . in its ground state , the flux - tube carries no angular momentum .",
    "the lowest excitation is an @xmath3=1 rotation which contains two degenerate states ( corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise rotations ) .",
    "linear combinations of these states give rise to quantum numbers of @xmath23 or @xmath24 for the flux - tube .",
    "adding these quantum numbers to those for the @xmath0 pair gives the possible @xmath5 for the hybrid mesons , which also are expected to have a nonet of states for each @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath25 , the possible quantum numbers are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that exotic hybrid mesons are _ not _ generated when @xmath2=0 , as these quantum numbers are possible for conventional @xmath0 states such as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "an important consideration in the study of these states is that non - exotic hybrids may mix with conventional @xmath0 states making clear experimental identification difficult .",
    "establishing the hybrid nonets will depend on starting with nonets whose quantum numbers are exotic to which ordinary @xmath0 states can not couple .    for @xmath2=1 , @xmath3=0 states the possible quantum numbers are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath24 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . of these states , those with @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31",
    "are manifestly exotic , i.e. they are not allowed for ordinary @xmath0 states .",
    "the existence of exotic hybrid mesons has been predicted for more than 3-decades .",
    "almost all qcd models predict a @xmath33 hybrid with a mass at or below 2  gev  @xcite , with favored widths in the range @xmath34  mev  @xcite . however , the decay modes are uncertain . in the flux - tube model ,",
    "the gluonic excitation does not transfer its spin to the relative orbital angular momentum of the final state mesons , and hybrid decay to two mesons with quarks in @xmath2-waves does not occur  @xcite .",
    "however , other models predict such a decay , through effects such as spurious bag cm motion  @xcite , or through the sequential decay of the exotic hybrid into a non - exotic hybrid and then into a conventional meson via mixing  @xcite .",
    "the non - exotic hybrid is mixed with a conventional meson which appears in the final state .",
    "a summary of current lqcd calculations for the lowest lying non - strange @xmath33 exotic meson is provided in fig .",
    "[ lqcd_proc ] @xcite .",
    "these quantum numbers should correspond to the lightest nonet .",
    "these calculations are quenched or partially quenched at the current time with some employing improved lattice actions , and they indicate that the rough mass scale to search in is about 1.5 - 2.0  gev .",
    "while the current results from lattice qcd indicate that the lightest exotic meson nonet has quantum numbers @xmath5=1@xmath35 and its lightest member , the @xmath36 , has a mass in the range from 1.5 to 2.0  gev , the current experimental evidence is much less clear . during the past two decades , a number of different experiments have provided tantalizing evidence for the @xmath37 exotics @xmath36(1400 ) , @xmath36(1600 ) , and @xmath36(2000 ) .",
    "if each of these states was verified , this would result in an overpopulation of the @xmath37 hybrid nonet where there should be only one @xmath36 state . in this section",
    "i provide a brief overview on each of the reported @xmath37 exotic candidates .    beyond issues associated with the statistics in each of these analyses ,",
    "the different experiments are hampered by a number of analysis issues .",
    "perhaps the most important arises due to leakage effects in the amplitude analysis . while the implementation of a partial wave analysis is in principle straightforward , there are difficulties that arise due to the detector system employed , as well as ambiguities within the partial wave analysis ( pwa ) framework itself .",
    "effects such as detector acceptance and resolution can conspire to allow strength from a dominant partial wave to appear as strength in a weaker wave .",
    "another important issue involves the model - dependent assumptions made within the pwa framework itself . in pwa , simplifying assumptions are used in order to make the fitting model more tractable , such as in calculating decay amplitudes via an isobar model , and the absolute effects of these assumptions are not fully known .",
    "the @xmath36(1400 ) was first reported by the gams group at cern  @xcite .",
    "it was seen in the @xmath38 channel at @xmath39=100  gev .",
    "a partial wave analysis of these data showed a clear @xmath40(1320 ) @xmath41-wave , and a narrow enhancement in the unnatural parity exchange @xmath42-wave at a mass of @xmath431.4  gev .",
    "the natural parity exchange @xmath44-wave was observed structureless .",
    "however , these conclusions were refuted by some of the original authors who pointed out that the @xmath45 pwa suffered from an eight - fold ambiguity which was not properly accounted for in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "the ves collaboration at ihep  @xcite , which studied the reaction @xmath46 with @xmath39=37  gev , reported a small but statistically significant broad enhancement in the natural parity exchange @xmath44-wave at about 1.4  gev .",
    "the authors did not identify the @xmath44 enhancement as a resonance .",
    "experiment e179 at kek studied the decay angular distributions in the @xmath47 reaction at @xmath39=6.3  gev .",
    "they observed an enhancement around 1.3  gev in the @xmath44-wave but were unable to establish a resonant nature .",
    "they noted the phase of the @xmath44-wave relative to the @xmath48 @xmath49 wave showed no distinct variation with mass  @xcite .",
    "the first resonant claim of the @xmath36(1400 ) was provided by the e852 collaboration at bnl in the reactions @xmath38 and @xmath47 at @xmath39=18  gev  @xcite . in this analysis the resonant nature of the @xmath44-wave arises from a strong interference with the @xmath48 @xmath49 wave .",
    "the phase difference between these waves exhibited a phase motion not attributable solely to the @xmath49 .",
    "results from the crystal barrel experiment at cern for the reactions @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath52=200  mev  @xcite , needed to include a @xmath36(1400 ) state in addition to conventional mesons to fit their data .    in the pdg listings",
    "@xcite , the mass of the @xmath36(1400 ) is @xmath53=1376@xmath5417  mev and its width @xmath55=300@xmath5440  mev with observed decays to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "however the current experimental evidence gives rise to a number of controversial issues .",
    "the @xmath36(1400 ) is significantly lighter than theoretical expectations , and its only observed decay mode into @xmath58 is not expected ( or strongly disfavored ) for a gluonic hybrid .",
    "it has been suggested that the @xmath36(1400 ) could represent a meson - meson molecule .",
    "an alternative suggestion is that the @xmath36(1400 ) could actually be a threshold effect of a higher mass @xmath36 resonance due to the opening of more favorable decay channels .",
    "work suggests that the exotic @xmath59-wave signature for the @xmath36(1400 ) may actually arise from dynamical non - resonant scattering , similar to @xmath2-wave @xmath60 scattering at low energy  @xcite .    a recent analysis of e852 data by dzierba _",
    "et al . _ focussed on an amplitude analysis of the @xmath56 mode in three different @xmath61 bins ( see fig .",
    "[ pi1400_c ] )  @xcite .",
    "this analysis concluded that no consistent @xmath59-wave resonant parameters can describe the data for the @xmath36(1400 ) , while the resonant parameters obtained for the @xmath40(1320 ) phase reference state are consistent for the different @xmath61 bins with the pdg values .",
    "however the question remains as to what causes the peaking in the @xmath59-wave intensity distributions , and if it is due to a non - resonant source , what explains the phase motion with respect to the @xmath40(1320 ) ?    another",
    "interesting fact is that while the exotic wave is a few percent of the dominant @xmath40 wave in the e852 data , it is of comparable strength to the @xmath40 in the crystal barrel results .",
    "however , each of the existing data sets in these hadroproduction experiments is hampered by relatively low statistics .",
    "a second @xmath5 = 1@xmath35 exotic meson at 1.6  gev has been claimed by the bnl e852 collaboration in the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 final states in @xmath66 reactions at @xmath39=18  gev @xcite .",
    "this signal first appeared as an enhancement in the @xmath44-wave in an early @xmath62 measurement by the ves collaboration  @xcite .",
    "additional ves measurements followed with confirmation of the @xmath36(1600 ) decaying into @xmath64 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "this work provided measurements of the relative branching ratios into @xmath64 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 of 1.0:1.0:1.6 .",
    "these predictions are highly at odds with predictions of the flux - tube model . thus either these three modes are not all due to a hybrid meson or there is a problem with the amplitude analysis or the flux - tube model .",
    "the evidence for the @xmath36(1600 ) from its decay into @xmath63 is particularly controversial .",

    "this later data run had roughly four times the statistics compared to the earlier run , and highlighted a strong pwa model dependence of the shape and magnitude of the @xmath37 signal .",
    "the @xmath37 intensity distribution exhibits a strong resonance - like distribution using a pwa model with a minimum number of partial waves ( 21 waves ) .",
    "however , when a larger wave set is used ( denoted as the high wave set in fig .",
    "[ pi1600_1_ss ]  includes 35 waves ) , the evidence for the @xmath36(1600 ) in the intensity distributions is washed out . nonetheless , it is curious that the phase motion plots are essentially unchanged between the two choices of wave sets .",
    "the comparison of the two @xmath69 modes provides powerful cross checks on the analysis results .",
    "any resonance decaying to @xmath70 should decay equally to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and thus appear with equal probabilities in the two modes .    in the e852 analysis of @xmath73 , evidence for an exotic @xmath37 state with a mass @xmath53=1597@xmath5410  mev and width @xmath55=340@xmath5440  mev",
    "is shown  @xcite ( see fig .",

    "it is interesting that the @xmath59-wave strength is the dominant signal in @xmath62 compared to @xmath63 .",
    "however , the strength in the @xmath41-wave used as the phase reference in the @xmath62 analysis is not well understood .",
    "so while there are some noted controversies associated with the @xmath36(1600 ) , there clearly are some tantalizing hints and effects from a number of experiments that need to be further investigated .      a final candidate @xmath5=1@xmath35 meson in the literature is the @xmath36(2000 ) which has been claimed by the e852 collaboration through its decays into @xmath65  @xcite and @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "while this is encouraging , as this state is more line with what is expected from flux - tube models and the lattice in terms of mass and decay modes , the data are of relatively limited statistical accuracy .",
    "in fact the quality of the data is such that strong conclusions regarding the evidence for this state can not be made .    the reported @xmath36(2000 ) from @xmath65",

    "the specifications for the next generation experiment in meson spectroscopy are already quite clear .",
    "the essential ingredients are that the detector should be hermetic for both charged and neutral particle final states , with excellent resolution and particle identification capability .",
    "this is essential for successful and unambiguous partial wave analysis .",
    "the beam energy must be high enough to allow for sufficient phase space for the production of the exotic states , however it should not be too high , otherwise the cross section for background processes will increase and overwhelm the signals that are being sought .",
    "the partial wave analysis requires high statistics experiments with sensitivity to production cross sections at the sub - nanobarn level .    in terms of beam properties ,",
    "the next generation experiment should be carried out with linearly polarized photons .",
    "photon beams are expected to be particularly favorable for the production of exotic hybrids , as the photon sometimes behaves as a virtual vector meson .",
    "when the flux tube in this @xmath2=1 system is excited , both ordinary and exotic @xmath5 are possible .",
    "in contrast , for an @xmath2=0 probe ( e.g. pions or kaons ) , the exotic combinations are not generated . to date",
    ", almost all meson spectroscopy experiments in the light - quark sector have been done with incident pion , kaon , or proton probes .",
    "high flux photon beams of sufficient quality and energy have not been available , so there are virtually no data on the photoproduction of mesons with masses below 3  gev .",
    "thus up to now , experimenters have not been able to search for exotic hybrid mesons precisely where they are expected .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that the photoproduction cross sections of light - quark exotic mesons should be comparable to those for conventional meson states in this energy range  @xcite .    as mentioned above , the next generation experiment should employ a linearly polarized photon beam .",
    "the diffractive production of a conventional meson takes place via natural parity exchange ( @xmath76 ) in the intermediate state , whereas exotic meson production takes place via unnatural parity exchange ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "experiments that take place with an unpolarized or a circularly polarized photon beam can not distinguish between the naturality of the exchanged meson .",
    "however with a longitudinally polarized beam , one can distinguish the naturality of the intermediate state by selection based on the angle the polarization vector makes with the hadronic production plane .",
    "this capability will be essential in helping to isolate the exotic waves in the data analysis .",
    "the current jefferson laboratory accelerator can deliver electron beams of up to nearly 6  gev at currents of @xmath43200  @xmath78a and polarization up to @xmath4380% .",
    "the planned upgrade of this facility is designed to increase the maximum electron beam energy to 12  gev , to construct a new experimental hall , called hall d , for the gluex experiment , and to lead to equipment enhancements in the three existing halls a , b , and c. the current schedule has the 12-gev facility on track to begin its physics program in 2011 - 2012 .",
    "the gluex experiment in hall d has been designed to perform meson spectroscopy over a range of masses up to roughly 3  gev  @xcite .",
    "although gluex aims to investigate the full spectrum of light conventional mesonic states , hybrid and exotic hybrid mesons , glueballs , multi - quark states , and molecular states , the exotic states will be the main initial thrust of the experimental program .",
    "[ gluex_det ] shows a schematic layout of the planned hermetic detector .",
    "the photon beam is incident on a liquid - hydrogen target that is located within a large 2  t superconducting solenoidal magnet .",
    "the target is surrounded by drift chambers for charged particle tracking .",
    "the tracking system includes a straw tube chamber for tracking at central and backward angles and a series of cathode strip chambers for tracking at forward angles .",

    "the solenoidal geometry is ideally suited for a high - flux photon beam . the electromagnetic charged particle background ( electron - positron pairs ) from interactions in the target is contained along the beam line by the axial field of the magnet .",
    "the gluex spectrometer has been designed for large and uniform acceptance for both charged and neutral particle final states , while providing the requisite resolution and particle identification capabilities for spectroscopy .",
    "the gluex photon beam will be produced using the coherent bremsstrahlung technique . here",
    "the 12  gev electron beam will impinge on a thin diamond crystal and will produce a linearly polarized beam of 9  gev photons after collimation . at the target",
    "the photon will achieve an average degree of linear polarization in the coherent peak of roughly 40% .",
    "this detector system , along with the high duty factor of the electron beam from the accelerator make the search for hybrid mesons quite feasible .",
    "gluex will collect enough data in its first year of operation with photon fluxes of 10@xmath80 to 10@xmath81 s@xmath82 to exceed existing photoproduction data by several orders of magnitude .",
    "hand in hand with the design of the experimental equipment , the gluex collaboration is performing detailed monte carlo studies of the physics , not only to test and improve the design of the spectrometer , but also to develop the software tools essential for the success of the data analysis .",
    "the performance of the detector , the beam flux , and the linear polarization of the photon beam determine the level of sensitivity for mapping the hybrid spectrum .",

    "a program of double - blind monte carlo studies have been carried out using the gluex partial wave analysis software .",
    "these studies have shown that low - level exotic signals ( at the few percent level ) can be successfully pulled out from the data , even with relatively low statistics .",
    "even with extreme distortions in these simulations , leakage effects due to the spectrometer are no more than 1% .",
    "to further certify the pwa codes , consistency checks with monte carlo and real data will be made among different final states for the same decay mode .",
    "understanding confinement requires an understanding of the glue that binds quarks into hadrons .",
    "hybrid mesons are perhaps the most promising laboratory to study the nature of the glue . however , since their first observation , their existence has been controversial , but a number of experimental results have provided tantalizing hints for the existence of these mesons .",
    "future studies , such as will be performed with the gluex experiment at jlab , provide the hope for improved experimental results and interpretations . here",
    "photoproduction promises to be rich in hybrids , starting with those having exotic quantum numbers where little or no data exist .",
    "the gluex experiment that will take place at the energy - upgraded jefferson laboratory , will employ photon beams of the necessary flux , duty factor , and polarization , along with an optimized state - of - the - art detector .",
    "this experiment will provide for the detailed spectroscopy necessary to map out the hybrid meson spectrum , which is essential for an understanding of the confinement mechanism and the nature of the gluon in qcd .",
