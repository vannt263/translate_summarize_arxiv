    "dynamics of highly excited ( rydberg ) atoms in microwave fields has been a subject of extensive research during the last thirty years . after experiments of bayfield and koch @xcite and theoretical work of leopold and percival @xcite ,",
    "it was realised that certain essential properties of the dynamics of rydberg hydrogen atoms can be described in the frames of classical approach .",
    "one of the classical ideas in this area is to control the keplerian motion of the electron using its resonant interaction with a wave of slowly changing frequency .",
    "dynamical problems of this kind were studied in @xcite for a 1-d model and @xcite for a 3-d model . in particular , in the latter work an hydrogen atom in a linearly polarized electric field of slowly decreasing frequency was considered .",
    "it was shown that at a passage through 2:1 resonance ( i.e. , when the driving frequency is twice as large as the keplerian frequency ) the system with initially zero eccentricity of the electron s orbit is captured into the resonance . in the captured state ,",
    "the electron s keplerian frequency varies in such a way that the resonant condition is approximately satisfied . in this motion",
    "the orbit s eccentricity grows , which may result in ionization of the atom .    in the present work we also consider a 3-d hydrogen atom in a linearly polarized electrostatic field of slowly changing frequency .",
    "we study behaviour of the system near 2:1 resonance using methods of the theory of resonant phenomena , developed in @xcite - @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these methods were previously used in studies of various physical problems including surfatron acceleration of charged particles in magnetic field and electromagnetic wave @xcite , slowly perturbed billiards @xcite , @xcite , and classical dynamics in a molecular hydrogen ion @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we show that capture into the resonance necessarily occurs not only in the case of zero initial eccentricity but also if the initial eccentricity is not zero but small enough .",
    "moreover , at larger values of the initial eccentricity the capture is also possible . following the general approach ,",
    "capture into the resonance in this case can be considered as a probabilistic phenomenon .",
    "we define and evaluate its probability .",
    "the obtained results can be used to broaden the applicability of the resonant control methods for rydberg atoms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we use standard techniques of classical celestial mechanics and the theory of resonant phenomena to reduce the equations of motion near the resonance to the standard form .",
    "we consider two different cases : one of small eccentricity and the other of eccentricity of order 1 . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the case of small eccentricity .",
    "we apply relevant results of @xcite and find the region of so called `` automatic capture '' into the resonance at small eccentricities and calculate probability of capture at larger values of initial eccentricity .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the capture phenomenon at values of eccentricity of order 1 .",
    "we calculate the capture probability in this case too . in the both cases ,",
    "the capture significantly changes the eccentricity of the electron s orbit and may lead to ionization . in conclusions , we summarize the results .",
    "we study dynamics of a classical electron in a hydrogen atom perturbed by a harmonically oscillating electric field of small amplitude @xmath0 , linearly polarized along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "this system is described with hamiltonian = _ 0 + z. [ 2.1 ] here @xmath2 is the unperturbed hamiltonian of motion in the coulomb field and @xmath3 is the perturbation phase . introduce the perturbation frequency @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 , i.e. that this frequency slowly changes with time . for brevity",
    ", we put the electron mass and charge to 1 , and use dimensionless variables .",
    "the unperturbed trajectory of the electron is an ellipse with eccentricity @xmath6 , semimajor axis @xmath7 , and inclination @xmath8 .",
    "it is a well - known fact from celestial mechanics that the so - called delaunay elements @xmath9 provide a set of canonical variables for the system under consideration ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the delaunay elements can be defined as    l = ,",
    "g = , h = i ; [ 2.2 ] @xmath10 is the mean anomaly , @xmath11 is the argument of the periapsis , and @xmath12 is the longitude of the ascending node ( see figure [ orbit ] ) .    in these variables ,",
    "hamiltonian ( [ 2.1 ] ) takes the form ( see @xcite ) : & = & _ 0 + _ 1 , _ 0 = - , + _ 1 & = & i ^_k=1 , where a_k = _k ( k e ) , b_k = _ k(k e ) .",
    "[ 2.3a ] here @xmath13 is the bessel function of integer order @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is its derivative .    in order to avoid possible singularities at @xmath16 , we make a canonical transformation of variables @xmath17 defined with generating function @xmath18 .",
    "the new canonical variables [ called poincar elements of the first kind ] are expressed in terms of the old ones as follows :    cc p_3 = l , & q_3 = l+g+h , + p_2 = g - l , & q_2 = g+h , + p_1 = h - g , & q_1 = h.    [ 2.4 ]    as the perturbation frequency slowly varies with time , the system passes through resonances with the unperturbed keplerian frequency @xmath19 .",
    "near a resonance , certain terms in expression ( [ 2.3 ] ) for @xmath20 are changing very slowly .",
    "consider a passage through the 2:1 resonance . in this case , after averaging over fast oscillating terms , we obtain the hamiltonian describing the dynamics near the resonance : = - + ( p_2,p_3 ) i ( 2q_3 - q_2 - q_1 - ) , [ 2.5 ] where we introduced the notation @xmath21 .",
    "the resonance is defined by @xmath22 .",
    "it follows from the unperturbed hamiltonian ( [ 2.3 ] ) that @xmath23 .",
    "hence , denoting the value of @xmath24 at the resonance as @xmath25 , we find : p_r = ( ) ^1/3 .",
    "[ 2.6 ]    our next step is to introduce the resonant phase .",
    "we do this with the canonical transformation @xmath26 defined with the generating function w = j_3(2q_3 - q_2 - q_1 - ) + j_2 q_2 + j_1 q_1 . [ 2.7 ] for the new canonical variables we have    cc j_3 = p_3/2 , & _ 3 = 2q_3 - q_2 - q_1 - , + j_2 = p_2 + p_3/2 , & _ 2 = q_2 , + j_1 = p_1 + p_3/2 , & _ 1 = q_1 .",
    "[ 2.8 ] the hamiltonian function takes the form : = - + ( j_2,j_3 ) i _ 3 - ( ) j_3 . [ 2.9 ] near the resonant value @xmath27 we can expand this expression into series . with the accuracy of order @xmath28 we obtain the following hamiltonian : = -32 + ( j_2,p_3)i _ 3 , [ 2.10 ] where canonically conjugated variables are @xmath29 and @xmath30 . introduce notations @xmath31 . the hamiltonian ( [ 2.10 ] ) does not contain @xmath32 , hence @xmath33 is an integral of the problem .",
    "another integral is @xmath34 , corresponding to the fact that delaunay element @xmath35 is an integral of the original system ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "coefficient @xmath36 in ( [ 2.10 ] ) should be taken at @xmath37 .",
    "we have .i |_p = p_r = . [ 2.10a ]",
    "from now on , we consider separately two different cases : the case of small initial eccentricity and the case when initial eccentricity is a value of order one .",
    "let us start with the first case",
    ".    assume the initial value of eccentricity is small , though not necessary zero . from ( [ 2.3a ] )",
    ", we have ( j , p ) = 14 p. [ 2.11 ] small eccentricity implies that @xmath38 .",
    "as the system evolves near the resonance , small variations of @xmath39 are essential when calculating the term @xmath40 in ( [ 2.11 ] ) and less important in the other terms .",
    "hence , in these latter terms , we can put @xmath37 .",
    "we write @xmath41 where we have used that @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we obtain ( j , p ) p_r^3/2 [ 2.12 ] and the following expression for the hamiltonian : _ 1 = -32 + p_r^3/2 .",
    "[ 2.13 ] introduce so - called poincar elements of the second kind : x = , y = .",
    "[ 2.14 ] the transformation @xmath43 is canonical with generating function @xmath44 . change the sign of @xmath45 and , to preserve the canonical form , the sign of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we obtain the hamiltonian in the form : _ 1 = 32 - 3(p_r - 2j )",
    "+ a(h , j , p_r)x , [ 2.15 ] where @xmath47 note , that if the eccentricity is small , then @xmath48 , and hence the slow variation of @xmath25 is essential only in the second term in ( [ 2.15 ] ) . in the other terms",
    ", @xmath25 can be assumed to be constant , say , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the value of @xmath25 at @xmath51 .",
    "now , we renormalise the hamiltonian @xmath52 to transform it to the following standard form studied in @xcite : _ 1 = ( x^2 + y^2)^2 - ( x^2 + y^2 ) + x [ 2.16 ] with @xmath53 and @xmath54 . we describe the dynamics defined by hamiltonian ( [ 2.16 ] ) in section 3 .",
    "return now to equation ( [ 2.10 ] ) and consider the case when the eccentricity is not small : @xmath55 . in this case",
    "we can put @xmath56 when calculating @xmath57 .",
    "thus we obtain _ 2 = -32 + b(h , j , p_r ) , [ 2.17 ] where b(h , j , p_r ) = i ( j , p_r ) = 14 , [ 2.17a ] and values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 are calculated at @xmath37 : a = p_r^2 , e = . [ 2.18 ] the system with hamiltonian function ( [ 2.17 ] ) is a pendulum with slowly changing parameters .",
    "we study the dynamics in this system in section 4 .",
    "dynamics in the system with hamiltonian function ( [ 2.16 ] ) was studied in details in @xcite . in this section",
    "we put forward the results of @xcite relevant to our study .    in (",

    "on the phase plane @xmath62 , the values @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see ( [ 2.14 ] ) ) are polar coordinates .",

    "parameter @xmath59 is changing slowly , and as the first step we consider the problem at fixed values of @xmath59 .",
    "phase portraits at different values of @xmath59 are presented in figures [ portrait12 ] , [ portrait3 ] . at @xmath65 ( figure [ portrait12]a )",
    "there is one elliptic stable point a on the portrait . at @xmath66 ( figure [ portrait3 ] )",
    "there are two elliptic stable points a and b , and one saddle point c. separatrices @xmath67 divide the phase plane into three regions @xmath68 . in figure",
    "[ portrait12]b , the portrait at @xmath69 is shown .",
    "the coordinates of point c are @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the largest root of equation = 4x^3 - 2x + = 0 .",
    "[ 3.1 ] at @xmath72 , introduce @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in @xmath75",
    "we have @xmath76 , in @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath79 , on the separatrices @xmath80 .",
    "as parameter @xmath59 slowly grows with time , @xmath81 , curves @xmath67 defined with @xmath80 slowly move on the phase plane . on time intervals of order @xmath82 their position on",
    "the phase plane essentially changes , together with the areas of @xmath83 . on the other hand ,",
    "area surrounded by a closed phase trajectory at a frozen value of @xmath59 is an approximate integral [ adiabatic invariant ] of the system with slowly varying parameter @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , a phase point can cross @xmath67 leaving one of the regions @xmath84 and entering another region .",
    "denote with @xmath85 a phase point moving according to ( [ 2.16 ] ) . without loss of generality",
    "assume that @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "the initial point @xmath88 can be either inside @xmath89 [ @xmath90 or out of @xmath89 [ @xmath91 .",
    "the following assertion is valid .",
    "all points lying inside @xmath89 at @xmath86 except , maybe , of those belonging to a narrow strip @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a positive constant , stay in @xmath75 at least during time intervals of order @xmath82 .",
    "this result is due to the fact that the area of @xmath75 monotonously grows with time , and conservation of the adiabatic invariant makes a phase point go deeper and deeper into this region .",
    "a point captured in @xmath75 rotates around point a@xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the smallest root of equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "as time grows , @xmath96 also grows and point a on the portrait slowly moves along @xmath46-axis in the negative direction .",
    "therefore , the motion is a composition of two components : fast rotation along a banana - shaped curve surrounding a and slow drift along @xmath46-axis .",
    "the area surrounded by each banana - shaped turn is approximately the same and equals the area @xmath97 surrounded by the trajectory passing through @xmath88 at @xmath98 .",
    "hence , the average distance between the phase point and the origin slowly grows , corresponding to the eccentricity growth in the original problem .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a point having zero initial eccentricity necessarily undergoes the eccentricity growth .",
    "the formulated result implies that this is also valid for all the points initially [ i.e. , at @xmath98 ] inside @xmath89 , except , maybe for a narrow strip close to @xmath89 .",
    "a typical linear size of this domain is of order @xmath100 . in @xcite",
    "this phenomenon was described and called `` automatic entry into libration '' .",
    "consider now the case when the point @xmath88 is outside @xmath89 : @xmath101 .",
    "with time the area inside @xmath89 grows , and at a certain moment the phase trajectory crosses @xmath89 . in the adiabatic approximation",
    "the area surrounded by the phase trajectory is constant : @xmath102 .",
    "hence , in this approximation the time moment of crossing @xmath89 can be found from equation @xmath103 .",
    "here @xmath104 is the area inside @xmath89 as a function of @xmath59 and @xmath105 is a value of the parameter at this moment . after crossing , there are two possibilities : ( i ) the phase point can continue its motion in @xmath75 during a time interval of order at least @xmath82 [ this corresponds to capture into the resonance and growth of the eccentricity ] ; ( ii ) without making a full turn inside @xmath75 the phase point can cross @xmath106 and continue its motion in @xmath78 [ this corresponds to passage through the resonance without capture ] .",
    "the area of @xmath78 also monotonously grows with time , hence such a point can not cross @xmath106 once more and return to @xmath75    it is shown in @xcite that the scenario of motion after crossing @xmath89 strongly depends on initial conditions @xmath88 : a small , of order @xmath107 , variation of initial conditions can result in qualitatively different evolution .",
    "if the initial conditions are defined with a final accuracy @xmath108 , @xmath109 , it is impossible to predict _ a priori _ the scenario of evolution .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider capture into @xmath75 or @xmath78 as random events and introduce their probabilities .",
    "following @xcite , consider a circle of small radius @xmath108 with the centre at the initial point m@xmath110 .",
    "then the probability of capture into @xmath75 is defined as = _ 0 _ 0 , [ 3.2 ] where @xmath111 is the measure of the circle of radius @xmath108 and @xmath112 is the measure of the points inside this circle that are captured finally into @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath113 be the parameter value at the moment of crossing @xmath89 in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the following formula for probability @xmath39 is valid : = , i_1 ( ) = -_l_1 t , i_2 ( ) = -_l_2 t , [ 3.3 ] and the integrals @xmath114 are calculated at @xmath113 . calculating the integrals",

    "as parameter @xmath59 changes by @xmath117 , a phase volume @xmath118 enters the region @xmath75 . at the same time , a volume @xmath119 leaves this region and enters @xmath78 .",
    "the relative measure of points captured in @xmath75 is @xmath120 .",
    "the integral @xmath121 in ( [ 3.3 ] ) is the flow of the phase volume across @xmath89 , and @xmath122 is the flow across @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , @xmath123 gives the relative measure of points captured into @xmath75 .",
    "note that , rigorously speaking , there also exists a set of initial conditions that should be excluded from consideration .",
    "phase trajectories with initial conditions in this set pass very close to saddle point c , and the asymptotic results of @xcite can not be applied to them .",
    "however , this exclusive set is small : it is shown in @xcite that its relative measure is a value of order @xmath124 .    in figure",
    "[ smallecc]a , capture into the resonance is shown .",
    "first , the phase point rotates around the origin in region @xmath77 , then it crosses @xmath89 , enters region @xmath75 and continues its motion in this region .",
    "in the course of this motion , the average distance from the origin grows , corresponding to the growth of the eccentricity . in figure [ smallecc]b ,",
    "all the parameter values are the same as in figure 4a , but initial conditions are slightly different . in this case , after crossing @xmath89 , the phase point crosses @xmath106 and gets into region @xmath78 .",
    "this is a passage through the resonance without capture .        summarizing the results of this section",
    ", we can say the following .",
    "( i ) capture into the resonance in the considered case results in growth of the eccentricity of the electron s orbit .",
    "( ii ) on the phase plane around the origin [ @xmath16 ] , there exists a region of size of order @xmath126 such that all phase trajectories with initial conditions [ i.e. at @xmath98 ] in this region undergo a capture into the resonance with necessity [ `` automatic capture '' ] .",
    "( iii ) if initial eccentricity is larger , and the initial point on the phase plane is out of the region mentioned above , there is a finite probability that the phase trajectory will be captured into the resonance .",
    "this probability is given by ( [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "if initial eccentricity is a value of order one , dynamics in a @xmath127-neighbourhood of the resonance is described by hamiltonian ( [ 2.17 ] ) . in this hamiltonian , @xmath128 is a monotonously increasing function of the slow time @xmath129 . at a frozen value of @xmath25 ,",
    "this is a hamiltonian of a pendulum , with elliptic points at @xmath130 and hyperbolic points at @xmath131 .",
    "denote the value of the hamiltonian at hyperbolic points with @xmath132 .",
    "the separatrices connecting the hyperbolic points with @xmath133 and @xmath134 are defined by equation @xmath135 or : p - p_r = p_r^2 . [ 4.1 ] the separatrices divide the phase cylinder @xmath136 into domains of direct rotation , oscillation , and reverse rotation .",
    "the area @xmath137 of the oscillatory domain is proportional to @xmath138 ; it can be shown that it is a monotonically growing function of @xmath25 .",
    "now take into consideration the slow growth of @xmath25 with time .",
    "this growth produces slow motion of the phase portrait upwards on the phase cylinder . at the same time the area between the separatrices slowly grows . as a result ,",
    "phase point initially above the upper separatrix , i.e. in the domain of direct rotation , can cross the separatrix and be either captured into the oscillatory domain ( this is a capture into the resonance ) , or pass through to the domain of reverse rotation .",
    "the final mode of motion strongly depends on initial conditions : a small , of order @xmath107 , variation in them can result in qualitatively different final mode of motion .",
    "thus , like in the situation described in section 3 , capture into the oscillatory domain in this problem can be considered as a probabilistic phenomenon .",
    "the probability of capture can be found as follows . as parameter @xmath25 changes by a small value @xmath139 , phase volume @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the length of the separatrix , crosses the upper separatrix . in the latter expression ,",
    "the first term is due to the growth of the area of the oscillatory domain , and the second term is due to the slow motion of the upper separatrix on the phase portrait . at the same time , phase volume @xmath142 enters the oscillatory domain and stays inside of it .",
    "hence , the probability of capture can be evaluated as = . [",
    "4.2 ] straightforward calculations give : = , [ 4.3 ] where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are bounded functions of @xmath25 ( we do not write the full expressions here explicitly for brevity ) .",
    "it can be shown ( see @xcite ) that asymptotically as @xmath145 ( [ 4.2 ] ) gives the correct value of @xmath123 defined as in ( [ 3.2 ] ) with @xmath112 denoting the measure of captured points inside a small circle of initial conditions . at @xmath146 , we find from ( [ 4.3 ] ) that @xmath147 .",
    "for a captured phase point value of @xmath39 remains at a distance of order @xmath127 from @xmath25 on time intervals of order @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , as it follows from expressions ( [ 2.18 ] ) , as @xmath25 grows , the eccentricity along the captured phase trajectory tends to @xmath148 , and the semimajor axis of the electron s orbit tends to infinity . at @xmath149 ,",
    "the eccentricity is always smaller than @xmath148 , and at @xmath150 it is always larger than @xmath148 .",
    "note , however , that in the original system , as it follows from ( [ 2.6 ] ) , the rate of variation of @xmath25 is large at large values of @xmath25 . therefore , strictly speaking , the asymptotic methods used in this section are not applicable in the limit @xmath151 .    in figure [ pendlike]a ,",
    "capture into the resonance is shown . in the beginning , the phase trajectory encircles the phase cylinder at approximately constant initial value of @xmath39",
