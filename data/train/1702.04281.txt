    "simple birth - and - death processes do not offer enough flexibility to model real biological populations in which the age of individuals impacts on their fertility and mortality rates .",
    "the memoryless property inherent to these models implies that individuals do not age .",
    "however , they are tractable and amenable to efficient parameter estimation . in this paper",
    ", we model the lifetime and reproduction epochs of individuals in a population using a _ transient markovian arrival process _ ( tmap ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "a tmap is a point process in which the event rate depends on the state of an underlying transient markov chain with @xmath0 transient states ( also called _ phases _ ) , and one absorbing phase . each event in the tmap corresponds to the birth of a child , and the absorption in phase 0 corresponds to the individual s death .",
    "the resulting continuous - time branching process , called _ markovian binary tree _ ( mbt ) , is the matrix generalisation of the birth - and - death process .",
    "it allows for much more flexibility than the latter , while keeping an excellent computational tractability .",
    "performance measures of mbts include the extinction probability of the population , the distributions of the time until extinction , the population size at any given time , and the total progeny size until any given time .",
    "the mbt model has already been used to efficiently compare demographic properties of female families in different countries , see @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind the present paper is to develop the statistical tools necessary to fit an mbt to populations of species for which detailed information about age - specific survival and reproductive rates of individuals is available .",
    "the model can then be used to calculate age - dependent demographic properties . by knowing the exact age of individuals of a population , its future survival probability can be assessed , which aids conservation management of endangered species .",
    "we fit a tmap to different types of datasets which may be available from demographic databases or from studying an animal population in the field .",
    "these datasets can have different degrees of detail .",
    "we distinguish between :    * _ global population data _ , consisting of the _ average _ age - specific fertility and mortality _ rates _ over an entire population .",
    "this sort of data is usually provided in databases on human fertility and mortality . *",
    "_ individual demographic data _ , consisting of data on age - specific fertility and mortality _ counts",
    "_ for each individual in a population .",
    "this sort of data often exists for closely monitored animal species . here",
    "we will use data from a highly threatened bird species , the chatham island black robin ( _ petroica traversi _ ) @xcite .",
    "the parameter estimation method depends on the type of data which are available : in the global population case , we use a weighted non - linear regression method to fit the parameters , and in the individual demographic data case , we use a maximum likelihood method .",
    "we consider different validation methods to determine the optimal number of phases @xmath0 in the tmap .",
    "once a value of @xmath0 is determined and an estimator is found for the model parameters , we derive confidence intervals for the model outputs .",
    "we apply our results to two real - world examples .",
    "the weighted non - linear regression method is applied in human demography leading to an improvement of the markovian model considered in @xcite .",
    "the maximum likelihood method is applied to the black robin population providing important insights about the species demography to be further discussed from a conservation biology point of view in a subsequent paper .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ tmmpp ] , we introduce tmaps and describe the special case that we shall focus on . in section  [ average ]",
    "we perform model parameter estimation based on the average age - specific fertility and mortality rates , and in section  [ ind ] , we estimate the parameters based on individual age - specific fertility and mortality counts . in section  [ num ]",
    "we apply each method on a real - world example .",
    "transient markovian arrival processes ( tmaps ) are two - dimensional markovian processes @xmath1 on the state space @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is finite , combining the _ level _ process @xmath3 , which counts the number of arrivals in @xmath4 $ ] , with the _ phase _ process , \\{@xmath5 , which is a continuous - time markov chain . the states @xmath6 are absorbing for all @xmath7 ; the other states are transient .",
    "a tmap is characterized by two @xmath8 rate matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 and a non - negative @xmath11 rate vector @xmath12 .",
    "feasible transitions are from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , for @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the rate @xmath17 , or from @xmath13 to @xmath18 for @xmath19 at the rate @xmath20 , or from @xmath13 to @xmath6 at rate @xmath21 .",
    "the first transitions ( at rate @xmath17 ) are _ hidden _ : the phase of the individual changes but the level is not incremented . the second transitions ( at rate @xmath20 ) are _ observable _ : a birth ( arrival ) is recorded , and the state of the individual may or may not change .",
    "the third transitions ( at rate @xmath21 ) indicate the termination of the individual s life .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 and the vector @xmath12 are nonnegative , @xmath9 has nonnegative off - diagonal elements and strictly negative elements on the diagonal such that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an @xmath11 vector of ones .",

    "a special case of tmap , called the _ acyclic transient markov modulated poisson process _ ( atmmpp ) , assumes    * individuals start their lifetime in phase 1 with probability one , * they can only move from phase @xmath29 to phase @xmath30 or to phase 0 , with respective rates @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath21 for @xmath33 , * while in phase @xmath29 , they reproduce at rate @xmath34 and do not make any simultaneous phase transition at reproduction time .    with these assumptions we have",

    "the lifetime distribution of a tmap is phase - type ph@xmath42 see @xcite . due to the structure of @xmath38 and @xmath43 in the atmmpp case",
    ", this corresponds to a coxian distribution .",
    "such distributions are important as any acyclic phase - type distribution has an equivalent coxian representation .",
    "therefore , in terms of the lifetime distribution , the atmmpp does not impose much restriction compared to the general tmap .",
    "[ av][average ]      for this section , we assume the available data are estimates of the expected age - specific fertility rates , @xmath44 , and estimates of the expected age - specific mortality rates , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the age , that is , the period of time @xmath47 during the lifetime , and @xmath48 is the maximal age for which data are available .",
    "the method developed in this section can be generalised to @xmath49-year age classes , details are provided in section [ ext ] of the supplementary material .",
    "the rates @xmath44 and @xmath45 are interpreted respectively as the expected number of offspring per year from a parent at age @xmath50 and the probability that an individual who reached age @xmath50 dies within the year .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 and @xmath52 the equivalent quantities computed from the tmap model .",
    "these functions have the following analytic expression , the proof of which is provided in section [ proof_quant ] of the supplementary material .",
    "[ quant ] the age - specific mortality and fertility rates in a tmap with phase transition rate matrix @xmath53 are respectively given by @xmath54      in @xcite only death rates were used to fit phase - type lifetime distributions .",
    "we extend this approach , estimating the model parameters by minimizing the sum of weighted squared errors @xmath55 \\hat{s}_x,\\ ] ] where the weights @xmath56 are the observed probabilities of survival until age @xmath50 , @xmath57 as age increases there may be less available data leading to higher variance .",
    "these weights balance the potential resulting heteroscedasticity .",
    "if the estimated age - specific rates @xmath45 and @xmath44 are computed as averages of @xmath58 uncorrelated raw observations , another simple choice of weights would be @xmath59 .",
    "since the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are non - linear in both the input variable @xmath50 and in the parameters of the tmap , we are dealing with a weighted non - linear regression .",
    "if there is missing information in the data and no estimate exists for @xmath45 or @xmath44 for some age @xmath50 , then we set the corresponding term @xmath60 or @xmath61 to zero in the sum .    _",
    "the function @xmath51 corresponds to the hazard rate at age @xmath50 in survival analysis .",
    "several hazard models have been considered to fit mortality data , such as the gompertz - makeham , the siler , and the heligman - pollard models @xcite .",
    "similarly , several age - specific fertility models have been studied , including the hadwiger , the beta , and the gamma models @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are not claimed to provide better fits than these models , however , as opposed to the known mortality and fertility models which are generally studied separately , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are performance measures coming from _ the same markovian model _ , and are thus optimised together .",
    "the estimated markovian model then corresponds to the best model fitting both the mortality and fertility data , and can be used to make a complete demographic study of the population , as shown in @xcite . _      in the global population data case we estimate the model parameters by minimizing the objective function .",
