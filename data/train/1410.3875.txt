    "first - order phase transitions of the universe generically lead to interesting phenomena and may have several observable consequences , such as topological defects @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , inhomogeneities @xcite , or gravitational waves ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of these cosmological remnants depend on the disturbance produced in the plasma by the nucleation and expansion of bubbles .",
    "this fact has led to extensive studies of the hydrodynamics associated with the motion of bubble walls ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as investigations of the microphysics responsible for the friction of these walls with the plasma @xcite",
    ".    studying the hydrodynamics of these phase transition fronts is a difficult task , and several approximations are generally needed in order to simplify the analysis .",
    "thus , it is usual to study the propagation of a single phase transition front , disregarding some global aspects of the dynamics of the phase transition ( e.g. , the presence of other bubbles or the cooling of the universe ) .",
    "in addition , the wall is assumed to move at a constant velocity .",
    "this is in general a good approximation since a terminal velocity is reached in a very short time after nucleation .",
    "other simplifications include considering symmetric bubble walls , e.g. , spherical or planar walls .",
    "the hydrodynamics of planar walls is easier to treat than that of spherical walls .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different @xcite . in the first stages of their expansion , the bubbles are certainly spherical .",
    "however , once bubbles collide this symmetry is lost . to treat the case of colliding bubbles , the envelop approximation @xcite is often used in the calculation of gravitational waves .",
    "this approximation assumes spherical ( overlapping ) bubbles , neglects the regions in which two or more bubbles overlap , and follows only the parts of walls which have not collided yet .",
    "however , when bubbles meet and coalesce , their walls straighten due to surface tension @xcite .",
    "thus , for a wall which envelops a system of several bubbles , the planar wall approximation may be as good as the spherical approximation .",
    "assuming an infinitely thin wall is also a good approximation for the treatment of hydrodynamics .",
    "the phase on each side of this interface can be described using a phenomenological equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "a frequently used approximation for the equation of state is given by the bag eos , which simplifies considerably the calculations and sometimes ( e.g. , in the case of a planar wall ) even leads to analytical results .",
    "the bag eos corresponds to having only radiation and vacuum energy in both the high- and low - temperature phases , which we shall denote with a @xmath0 and a @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "therefore , this eos depends on a few free parameters , namely , the vacuum energy densities @xmath2 ( in general , @xmath3 is assumed ) and the radiation constants @xmath4 , which are proportional to the stefan - boltzmann constant and the number of degrees of freedom in each phase . besides being useful for analyzing general properties of the phase transition ,",
    "the results obtained using the bag eos can be applied to realistic models by calculating the values of the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 for such models . to do that , one has to identify , for a given model , the vacuum energy density and the radiation constant in each phase . since in general the model will not consist of just vacuum energy and radiation , it will be necessary to define effective constants @xmath7 which will in fact depend on the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "needless to say , the definitions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are ambiguous for a general system .",
    "nevertheless , in general one may set the values of the bag parameters so as to give the desired values of some relevant quantities ( e.g. , the latent heat , the critical temperature , etc . ) .",
    "however , the few free parameters of the bag eos may fall short of describing all the desired features of the model under study . in particular ,",
    "the hydrodynamics associated to the motion of bubble walls depends on the speed of sound in the plasma , which is given by @xmath11 ( we use natural units with @xmath12 ) . for the bag model",
    ", the speed of sound is that of radiation in both phases , @xmath13 . for a realistic model ,",
    "however , @xmath14 will be different in each phase .",
    "moreover , in general we will have a temperature - dependent functions @xmath15 . as a consequence ,",
    "the sound velocity will vary in space and time during the phase transition .    in this paper , we shall discuss to what extent the speed of sound may depart from the radiation value @xmath16 in a realistic model .",
    "as we shall see , in the low - temperature phase the speed of sound @xmath17 may be significantly smaller than that value .",
    "we shall also investigate the implications of having a different speed of sound in each phase .",
    "for that aim , we shall consider a family of models which can be regarded as the simplest generalization of the bag eos .",
    "we obtain this phenomenological eos by requiring it to give a constant speed of sound .",
    "the model is still simple enough to obtain analytical results for planar walls .",
    "we shall calculate , in particular , the kinetic energy in bulk motions of the fluid , after finding the different kinds of hydrodynamic solutions for the propagation of a phase transition front .",
    "the plan is the following . in the next section we study the possible values of the speed of sound in a physical model and we discuss the shortcomings of using phenomenological equations of state as an approximation . in sec .",
    "[ hidrogral ] we review the hydrodynamics involved in the propagation of phase transition fronts and we discuss on some ambiguities and some misleading definitions in the literature . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce our model family .",
    "we analyze the different kinds of phase transitions described by this model , and we study the hydrodynamics for each case . for the case @xmath18 , we find a solution which does not arise for the bag eos , namely , a jouguet detonation which is subsonic with respect to the fluid in front of it , and as a consequence is preceded by a shock wave .",
    "we also calculate the fraction of the energy released at the phase transition which goes into bulk motions of the fluid . in sec .",
    "[ effic ] we study the dependence of this quantity on the speed of sound .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",

    "the free energy density @xmath19 of a system may depend on an order parameter @xmath20 .",
    "this generally happens in models with scalar fields , where @xmath19 is given by the finite - temperature effective potential , and @xmath20 is given by the expectation value of one or more of the scalar fields .",
    "the equilibrium state of the system corresponds to a minimum of the free energy . as a consequence ,",
    "if the function @xmath21 has more than one minimum a cosmological phase transition may occur .",
    "a first - order phase transition occurs when two such minima coexist , separated by a free energy barrier , in a certain range of temperatures .",
    "one of these minima is the absolute minimum at higher temperatures , while the other one becomes the absolute minimum at lower temperatures .",
    "let us denote these minima @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ( we shall use in general a `` @xmath0 '' index for the high - temperature phase and a `` @xmath1 '' index for the low - temperature phase ) .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath24 is defined as that at which the two minima have exactly the same free energy density .",
    "therefore , for @xmath25 the system is in the stable phase given by the minimum @xmath26 , while for @xmath27 this phase becomes metastable .",
    "the phase transition typically develops via the nucleation and expansion of bubbles at a given temperature @xmath28 which is lower than @xmath24 , i.e. , a certain amount of supercooling occurs before the phase transition begins ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the equation of state can be derived from the equilibrium free energy densities in each phase , given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the pressure is given by @xmath31 , the entropy density by @xmath32 , the energy density by @xmath33 , and the enthalpy by @xmath34 .",
    "at the critical temperature the two phases have the same pressure , @xmath35 .",
    "on the other hand , the energy , entropy and enthalpy are different in each phase , and we will have discontinuities at the phase transition .",
    "the latent heat is defined as the energy density discontinuity at the critical temperature , @xmath36 . for a bubble expanding at @xmath37 , an energy density @xmath38",
    "is released at the phase transition fronts ( bubble walls ) .",
    "a simple approximation for the equation of state in each phase is given by the bag eos , @xmath39 which can be derived from the free energy density @xmath40 this equation of state is based on the bag model for hadrons @xcite . in that case ,",
    "( [ eosbag ] ) describes a first - order qcd phase transition .",
    "physically , the approximation represented by eq .",
    "( [ eosbag ] ) corresponds to assuming that the two phases consist of a gas of massless particles , each one with different numbers ( and kinds ) of particle species ( namely , quarks and gluons in the @xmath0 phase , and pions in the @xmath1 phase ) .",
    "these numbers of degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) are proportional to the constants @xmath4 . in this context , the constant @xmath41 is given by the bag constant @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is assumed to vanish .    with the aim of simplifying the treatment of hydrodynamics ,",
    "the bag eos is often considered as an approximation to describe general phase transitions , including the electroweak phase transition ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in the context of a higgs mechanism",
    ", this eos can be interpreted as follows . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the system is in a false vacuum and we have a certain number of massless d.o.f .",
    "therefore , we have a vacuum energy density @xmath41 and a radiation energy density @xmath45 . at @xmath46 ,",
    "a number of degrees of freedom ( proportional to @xmath47 ) suddenly become very massive and disappear from the plasma . at the same time , a false vacuum energy density @xmath48 is liberated . in order to compare this approximation with a realistic case ,",
    "let us consider a simple system in which some of the particles masses depend on a higgs field @xmath49 , and the free energy density is given by the one - loop finite - temperature effective potential @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the renormalized zero - temperature effective potential and @xmath52 is the finite - temperature correction @xcite @xmath53 .",

    "( [ f1loop2 ] ) is exponentially suppressed , and the species gives a vanishing contribution .",
    "thus , the bag eos is obtained in the limit in which all the particles are very light in the high - temperature phase , i.e. , @xmath62 , while some of the species acquire very large masses in the low - temperature phase , i.e. , @xmath63 , the rest of them remaining relativistic .",
    "indeed , in such a case we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 , with @xmath55 running over all particle species , while @xmath66 , where @xmath67 runs only over the particles which remain light in the @xmath1 phase . in most cases of interest",
    "we have @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is a constant . in some cases",
    ", @xmath70 is close to its zero - temperature value , and is also approximately constant .",
    "hence , we obtain eq .",
    "( [ fbag ] ) , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "if any of the above conditions is not fulfilled , we expect some deviation from the bag eos",
    ".    since in general we have @xmath73 , the masses @xmath74 are constant in the @xmath0 phase .",
    "thus , one expects a deviation from eqs .",
    "( [ eosbag]-[fbag ] ) only for those particles with @xmath75 ( otherwise the particles either behave like radiation or disappear from the plasma ) .",
    "a measure of such a deviation is provided by the dimensionless quantity @xmath76 , where a prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "assume , for instance , that we have a number @xmath77 of degrees of freedom , and only @xmath78 of them have a ( constant ) mass @xmath79 in the @xmath0 phase , the rest of them being massless .",
    "we obtain the sound velocity @xmath80 by integrating numerically eq .",

    "we see that , as expected , for very small or very large values of @xmath81 we obtain the radiation result @xmath82 .",
    "notice also that the departure from this value is never too large , even if a sizeable fraction of the degrees of freedom have a mass @xmath83 .    on the other hand , in the low - temperature phase we have @xmath84 ( unless the phase transition is very weakly first - order ) , and some of the masses will fulfill the relation @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , in the general case the value of the minimum @xmath70 depends on the temperature .",
    "this will cause a model - dependent function @xmath86 . in the case",
    "@xmath87 , we can expand eq .",

    "notice that the radiation component is the same in both phases , i.e. , the term @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath97 even in the @xmath1 phase .",
    "this is because the massive d.o.f .",
    "have not disappeared completely . on the other hand",
    ", we have a correction @xmath98 to the radiation eos .",
    "if we neglect the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath8 , we have @xmath99 , while in the @xmath0 phase we may assume @xmath100 . in terms of the thermodynamical parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 defined above , we have in this case @xmath103 this approximation provides a simple eos with some interesting differences with respect to the bag eos .",
    "one of them is a sound velocity @xmath104",
    ".    the model ( [ hkllm ] ) can be useful to study the effects of a temperature - dependent speed of sound on the hydrodynamics of phase transition fronts .",
    "however , despite the simplicity of the eos , the space variation of temperature implies a space - dependent speed of sound which will make it difficult to avoid a numerical treatment .",
    "we shall address this issue elsewhere . in the present work",
    "we shall neglect the dependence of @xmath105 on @xmath8 .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation if the temperature only varies in a small range about @xmath24 , which is true for most phase transitions from @xmath24 ( e.g. , the bubble nucleation rate or the bubble wall velocity ) , this is not the case of the speed of sound . ] .",
    "in contrast , since the equation of state may depart significantly form the bag eos ( particularly in the @xmath1 phase ) , the values of @xmath106 may depart from the bag value @xmath16 .",
    "for the model ( [ hkllm ] ) we have @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",

    "the fact that the equation of state ( [ hkllm ] ) can be obtained from the one - loop free energy through an expansion in powers of @xmath81 rather than in the limit @xmath114 , indicates that this model may be more realistic than the bag in many physical situations . on the other hand",

    ", the temperature dependence of the minimum @xmath115 can make the value of @xmath17 depart significantly form that of @xmath80 , depending on details of the model . in order to explore the possible values of the speed of sound in a realistic case",
    ", we have considered the case of the electroweak phase transition , for a few extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the electroweak phase transition occurs at @xmath116 .",
    "the number of sm degrees of freedom is @xmath117 .",
    "the higgs - dependent masses are of the form @xmath118 and we have @xmath73 .",
    "thus , in the high - temperature phase the particles are massless . in the low - temperature phase",
    "most of the particles remain effectively massless , since the couplings to the higgs are @xmath119 except for the top quark and the @xmath120 and @xmath121 bosons . in the sm",
    "the phase transition is weakly first - order , which means that @xmath122 , but in extensions of the sm we may have strongly first - order phase transitions .",
    "we have considered models with extra bosons and fermions with masses of the form @xmath123 ( for details on these models see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figcpt ] we show the value of @xmath124 as a function of the coupling @xmath125 .",
    "the solid line which is closer to the value @xmath126 corresponds to adding to the sm a scalar field with @xmath127 d.o.f .",
    "the other solid line corresponds to a scalar field with @xmath128 d.o.f .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines correspond to extra fermions strongly coupled to the higgs - independent terms .",
    "hence , these bosons are decoupled from the physics at @xmath129 @xcite . ] . again , we have considered @xmath127 and @xmath128 extra d.o.f . ,",
    "and the case @xmath127 is that with the smaller departure from the radiation case . we have also considered a case of extra bosons and fermions ( dashed line ) with the same coupling @xmath125 and the same number of d.o.f . , @xmath128 .",
    "it is interesting to check that the speed of sound approaches the relativistic value in the two expected limits ; namely , for small @xmath125 and large @xmath125 . indeed , as @xmath130 the mass of the extra particle vanishes and the species behaves as radiation .",
    "the exact value @xmath126 is not reached in this limit since we still have the massive sm particles . for large @xmath125 ,",
    "the extra particles become very massive and decouple from the plasma .",
    "besides , in some cases the phase transition becomes very strong , with large values of @xmath131 , and even the sm particles acquire large values of @xmath81 ( essentially , because @xmath101 becomes small ) .",
    "this is why the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figcpt ] quickly approach the value @xmath126 as @xmath125 is increased .",
    "indeed , for larger values of @xmath125 than those considered in the figure , the phase transition becomes too strong and these models become unphysical .",
    "we observe that the departure from the radiation eos is more significant for the case of strongly coupled fermions .",
    "nevertheless , notice that even with only two extra bosonic d.o.f .",
    "we may have a departure from the radiation value which is comparable to the strongest of the cases considered in fig .",
    "[ figcmass ] for a constant mass .",
    "such a difference between the possible values of @xmath17 and @xmath80 is due to the temperature dependence of the minimum @xmath115 .",
    "this induces a temperature dependent mass @xmath132 as well as a temperature dependent `` vacuum '' energy density @xmath133 .",
    "both affect the value of @xmath134 .",
    "notice that the light sm d.o.f .",
    "behave like radiation , and their contribution to the free energy density is of the order of @xmath135 . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of the particles with temperature - dependent masses is smaller since it is proportional to their number of d.o.f .",
    ", @xmath78 . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "this contribution is of order @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , the `` vacuum '' part is of order @xmath137 .",
    "since we have considered values of @xmath138 , the radiation part of the free energy density should be a factor of @xmath139 higher than the non - radiation parts , and one may wonder why the deviations from @xmath140 are so large in some cases .",
    "in fact , the speed of sound involves derivatives of these contributions .",
    "thus , the light particles contribute terms of order @xmath141 while the particles which become heavy contribute terms @xmath142 .",
    "the latter derivative is in many cases large at @xmath129 , and in some cases we even have @xmath143 . as a consequence",

    "[ figpots ] the plot of the difference @xmath158 ( normalized to @xmath159 ) , i.e. , we subtracted the radiation contribution from the free energy density .",
    "the left panel corresponds to the case of 12 strongly coupled extra fermions with @xmath160 ( which , according to fig .",
    "[ figcpt ] , has a large departure from the radiation case ) .",
    "we see that , indeed , the low - temperature minimum has a variation @xmath161 in a temperature range @xmath162 ( hence , @xmath143 ) . for comparison",
    "we also show the case of @xmath163 ( right panel ) , corresponding to a stronger phase transition . in this case",
    "the minimum @xmath151 is closer to its zero - temperature value and varies very little in a larger temperature range .",
    "in such a case we have a smaller deviation from @xmath140 .",
    "we thus conclude that in a realistic case we will most likely have @xmath164 .",
    "in particular , the one - loop effective potential gives the sound velocity bound @xmath165 .",
    "this seems to be a general bound for the speed of sound in any medium , including strongly coupled field theories like qcd @xcite , although there is no fundamental reason for this bound @xcite .",
    "regarding the relation @xmath18 , although it is the most probable case , we may also have @xmath166 or even @xmath167 .",

    "for @xmath169 and @xmath125 large enough we may have @xmath170 , @xmath171 . the contribution of this species alone to the effective potential can make the phase transition strongly first - order . on the other hand , in the @xmath0 phase this contribution will tend to lower the speed of sound from its radiation value , while in the @xmath1",
    "phase the particle will disappear from the plasma , which may thus behave as radiation .",
    "in such a case we will have @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",

    "in particular , as already discussed , the quantity @xmath176 does not generally behave like vacuum energy density . with no loss of generality ,",
