    "the origin of dark energy , responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe first observed by @xcite and @xcite , is one of the most important unsolved problems in cosmology today , and significant effort is being devoted to constrain its properties .",
    "dark energy affects both the expansion history of the universe as well as the growth of structures .",
    "both effects can be observationally constrained through large galaxy redshift surveys , which enable the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ; thus , constraining the cosmic expansion history ) and large scale redshift - space distortions ( thus , constraining the growth history of the large scale structure ) .",
    "the combination of these two measurements allows the differentiation between an unknown energy component and modification of general relativity as the cause of observed cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "upcoming space - based missions , esa s _ euclid _ @xcite and nasa s _ wfirst - afta _ @xcite , will perform complementary galaxy redshift surveys to map the large - scale structure and its evolution over a cosmic time covering the last 10 billion years . both _",
    "euclid _ and _ wfirst - afta _ will use the h@xmath0  @xmath136563 line and [ oiii ]  @xmath144959 + 5007 doublet to select emission line galaxies as tracers of the large scale structure at 0.7@xmath152 ( in h@xmath0 ) and 2@xmath152.7 ( in [ oiii ] ) .",
    "the performance of the planned missions can be quantified by a figure - of - merit , which describes their ability to measure the present value and time evolution of the dark energy equation of state .",
    "the figure - of - merit for a dark energy survey depends on the number density of tracer galaxies available at each redshift .",
    "it is therefore critical to have a reliable and sufficiently precise knowledge of the expected number of h@xmath0  and [ oiii ]  galaxies in the survey volumes .",
    "_ euclid _ and _ wfirst - afta _ will both perform ir slitless spectroscopy of emission line galaxies , in a way similar ( scaled by many orders of magnitude in area ) to the ir spectroscopic surveys that are being conducted with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on - board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) . the wfc3 infrared spectroscopic parallel survey ( wisp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an on - going pure - parallel near - infrared grism spectroscopic survey using the wfc3 camera . while covering a substantially smaller area",

    "we extend the work by @xcite and estimate h@xmath0  number counts out to @xmath5 .    ground - based wide - field narrow - band surveys like hizels @xcite and newfirm h@xmath0  survey @xcite have been able to measure the h@xmath0  luminosity function in the redshift range of interest ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , while having the advantage of high sensitivity to emission lines and covering significant areas in the sky , these surveys can only map very narrow redshift ranges .",
    "volume densities of galaxies can thus be strongly affected by the presence of large scale structures in the field .",
    "moreover , samples selected with narrow band surveys , without an extensive spectroscopic followup , can suffer from contamination by emission lines at different redshifts ( e.g. , [ oiii ]  and [ oii ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , even narrow - band surveys with multiple filters tuned to identify multiple emission lines at the same redshifts still rely on continuum detections and miss the lowest mass galaxies , to which wisp is very sensitive .",
    "wisp s grism coverage includes h@xmath0  for the redshift range @xmath16 and [ oiii ]  for @xmath18 .",
    "since h@xmath0  is not directly covered by wisp at @xmath19 , we can not measure the h@xmath0  luminosity function up to z@xmath72 explicitly .",
    "however , we can use the [ oiii ]  coverage to estimate the h@xmath0  luminosity function and number counts . in order to do this",
    ", we compute the bivariate h@xmath0[oiii ]  line luminosity function in the redshift where both lines are visible , and use the resulting fit at higher redshifts , where only [ oiii]-emitters are observable in the wisp data . we also introduce a modified maximum likelihood estimator to obtain the best - fit model parameters , which accounts for measurement uncertainties in the line luminosity ( which can substantially affect the shape of the bright end of the luminosity function ) .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : data ] , we summarize the new wisp data that we use in this work ; section  [ sec : ha_oiii_trend ] discusses the observed h@xmath0[oiii ]  relation ; and section  [ sec : blf_def ] describes the parametrization for the bivariate luminosity function . in section  [ sec : mle ] , we discuss the maximum likelihood estimator modified to account for uncertainties in the line flux , and the fitting procedure , which we use to derive the h@xmath0[oiii ]  bivariate luminosity function at redshift @xmath4 and the result is discussed in section  [ sec : blf ] .",
    "further , in section  [ sec : z1 ] , we demonstrate the ability to recover the h@xmath0  luminosity function as well as number counts from fitting only the [ oiii ]  data at redshift @xmath4 .",
    "lastly , we fit the [ oiii ]  luminosity function and use it to derive the h@xmath0  luminosity function and number counts at redshift @xmath5 in section  [ sec : z2 ] , along with the final number count estimates for the upcoming dark - energy surveys .    throughout this paper ,",

    "( 2015 , in prep ) . in order to remove the high contamination rate from false and/or spurious sources due to the parallel , slitless nature of the wisp survey , every candidate emission line undergoes independent visual inspection by two team members .",
    "this process of visually confirming the emission lines is described in further detail in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the h@xmath0  @xmath136563 line and [ oiii ]  @xmath144959 + 5007 doublet , which are covered by wisp survey over the redshift ranges : @xmath27 ( only h@xmath0 ) , @xmath28 ( both h@xmath0+[oiii ] ) , @xmath29 ( only [ oiii ] ) .",
    "we exclude all sources with any ambiguity in their redshift determination among multiple reviewers .",
    "specifically , we only retain sources with a quality flag @xmath30 , which implies consensus among the independent reviewers ( ross et al .",

    "although @xcite and @xcite report decreasing [ nii]/h@xmath0  ratio with increasing h@xmath0  equivalent width , this ratio is nearly constant up to h@xmath0  ew @xmath7200 , above which the correlation steepens .",
    "the fraction of galaxies in our sample for which we may overestimate the [ nii ]  contribution due to the assumed constant correction is only 10% .    in what follows ,",
    "we use the completeness analysis from @xcite , who performed extensive simulations to quantify the survey incompleteness as a function of line signal  to  noise ratio , equivalent width ( ew ) , as well as galaxy size .",
    "the completeness simulations followed the full line extraction process after adding artificial sources to the real data , spanning a range in redshifts , radii , brightnesses , equivalent widths ( ews ) , as well as using different empirical spectral templates from the kinney - calzetti altas .",
    "these simulations show that slitless spectroscopic surveys display some level of incompleteness even at large ews and line fluxes , primarily because of spectral overlap and line mis - identification .",

    "the _ red _ points in figure  [ fig : sample_blf ] show line luminosities for a sample of 2141 star - forming galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , limited to the redshift range @xmath32 , in order to ensure that @xmath33 spectroscopic aperture contains most of the galaxy flux ( rather than just the central nucleus ) , and to avoid evolutionary effects .    despite the large scatter ( on the order of 0.5 dex )",
    ", the two line luminosities are broadly correlated , both in the sdss as well as wisp samples .",
    "this is not surprising : both h@xmath0  and [ oiii ]  are observed in the ionized gas in star - forming galaxies , although , while the h@xmath0  luminosity scales directly with the ionizing fluxes of embedded young , hot stars , the [ oiii ]  luminosity is more strongly dependent on variations in the oxygen excitation state , overall gas oxygen abundance , gas density , as well as dust reddening ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : sample_blf ] also shows that the h@xmath0[oiii ]  relation does not evolve significantly in the @xmath74.5 billion years elapsed between @xmath34 ( sdss galaxies ) and @xmath4 ( wisp galaxies ) .",
    "although the gas oxygen abundance is observed to evolve with cosmic time , the similarity between the observed trends suggests that any evolution is masked by the large scatter introduced by the range of physical conditions present in galaxies .    as we will show in section  [ sec : z1 ] , the observed broad correlation between h@xmath0  and [ oiii ]  luminosity is sufficient for the goal of estimating the number of h@xmath0  emitters from the numbers of [ oiii ]  emitters , as long as the scatter is appropriately taken into account . in computing the number of h@xmath0  emitters from [ oiii ]  emitters at higher redshifts , we will assume that the trend between h@xmath0  and [ oiii ]  does not change in the @xmath72.2 billion years between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    and [ oiii ]  luminosity in the sdss star - forming galaxies in @xmath32 ( _ red points _ ) as well as our wisp sample in redshift range @xmath31 ( _ black points _ ) .",

    "hence , we estimate the h@xmath0  number counts from the available [ oiii ]  number counts . in order to do this , we start by computing the h@xmath0[oiii ]  bivariate line luminosity function ( llf ) , which describes the volume density of sources as a function of both the h@xmath0  and [ oiii ]  luminosities .",
    "the most widely used parametric form for galaxy luminosity functions is the schechter function @xcite , which is fully described by the parameters @xmath39 ( characteristic luminosity ) , @xmath40 ( number of galaxies per unit volume at @xmath39 ) , and @xmath0 ( faint end slope ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : sim_1d ] shows the results for the single line lf simulations , for the two different sample sizes for both the original and modified mle .",
    "the modified mle recovers the true parameters with greater overall accuracy in both large and small sample size cases , even though the scatter is similar .",
    "since measurement uncertainties are not properly treated by the original mle , a few bright sources with large uncertainties can skew the results significantly .",
    "the modified mle is much less prone to this effect since it marginalizes over the uncertainty .",
    "the efficiency of the two estimators depends on what factor is dominating : the statistical randomness of the sample or the measurement uncertainties of the sample .",
    "since wisp is a slitless grism spectroscopy survey , even the bright sources can have significant uncertainties due to crowding , contamination or other issues .",
    "for our sample , the modified mle is expected to provide an improvement over the original mle ."
