    "galactic scaling relations such as the ` main sequence of star formation ' ( the relation between star - formation rate and stellar mass , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide important constraints on galaxy evolution models and the physical processes involved .",
    "one such relation reflects that massive star - forming galaxies contain large amounts of dust while old elliptical ( red and dead ) galaxies do not .",
    "this qualitative notion was quantified by @xcite who showed that for sdss galaxies there is a tight @xmath0sfr relation , @xmath0  @xmath4 sfr@xmath5 . the @xmath0sfr relation presented by @xcite consists of 3258 low - redshift sdss galaxies with complementary data from galex , 2mass and iras .",
    "the 1653 data points with the highest signal - to - noise ratio are reproduced in figure  [ f : dacunha ] ( blue data points ) .",
    "naively , one might interpret this to be a causal relation , either due to star formation induced by the prior presence of dust as seeds for star formation ( although this poses the question of where the initial amounts of dust come from in the first place ) or as a direct consequence of dust produced following massive star formation ( or , rather , death ) .",
    "however , @xcite advocated a different scenario in which the relation emerges as a consequence of the parallel decline of dust and sfr due to the decreasing gas mass available for star formation as time goes on and a simultaneous decline in total dust mass due to dust destruction .    to shed further light on the @xmath0sfr relation we here populate the @xcite observational diagram with additional classes of galaxies .",
    "in particular , in section  2 we extend it to higher sfr and @xmath0   by including sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "these galaxies bring important new insight into the physical origin of the relation . in section  3 we model the extended relation using simple chemical evolution models for massive galaxies , both from a simple analytical perspective and using full numerical models . in particular , we show that the slope of the relation can be related to the exponent of the schmidt  kennicutt star - formation law , relating the sfr to the available gas reservoir . finally , in section  4 , we discuss how starbursts , quiescent star formation and quenching of the star formation cause galaxies to move around in the diagram and contribute to the significant scatter revealed here .",
    "we supplement the original @xcite @xmath0sfr relation with the _ herschel _ early - type galaxies ( etgs ) and passive spirals studied by @xcite .",
    "these are plotted in figure  [ f : dacunha ] as red filled ( etgs ) and open ( spirals ) circles .",
    "the milky way data point is taken from @xcite .",
    "for smgs we use recent alma based data points from @xcite .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite data points are for a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and a dust mass absorption coefficient of @xmath6 @xmath7 g@xmath8 at 850 @xmath9 , as implemented in magphys @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sfr was obtained by multiplying the far - infrared luminosity by @xmath10 m@xmath11  l@xmath11@xmath8 yr@xmath8 ( appropriate for a chabrier imf ; the uv contribution to the total sfr in smgs is negligible ) .",
    "the quoted dust masses were multiplied by 1.5/0.77 to rescale to the same dust mass absorption coefficient .",
    "we note that while the literature data have been scaled to the same imf and dust mass absorption coefficient , systematic offsets in the different subsamples may remain , due to different wavelength coverage , redshift , and methods of analysis used .",
    "for example , the lack of long - wavelength ( @xmath12 @xmath13 m ) data in @xcite may bias dust temperatures high and hence dust masses low @xcite .",
    "the @xcite relation ( shown as a thick pale - blue dashed line ) does not extend to very high sfrs and dust masses . extrapolating the relation to high sfrs shows that observed dust masses are about an order of magnitude smaller than predicted ( this effect would be even stronger if the @xcite dust masses are underestimated ) .",
    "it is also evident that the relation is not as sharply defined as suggested by the sdss galaxies alone .",
    "we discuss these effects below .",
    "chemical evolution models can be used to study the temporal evolution of dust , gas , abundance distribution of elements , stellar mass and metallicity in a galaxy .",
    "the models are governed by processes regulating the evolution of a galaxy and , thus , are useful to study not only the chemical history but also to trace the sfr and the effects of the imf , gas flows , and dust destruction and growth processes .",
    "chemical evolution models have been applied to diverse types of galaxies , such as the milky way , high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or high-@xmath14 quasars .      in this letter",
    "we model a galaxy as a homogeneous entity ( no spatial dependence of its properties ) and with no infalling or outflowing material ( closed box approximation ) .",
    "efficient supernova ( sn ) dust production is assumed , while dust grain growth in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is not explicitly considered .",
    "relevant rates are assumed to be independent of metallicity .",
    "the model is described in detail in , whose notation we adopt .",
    "the rate of change of the total dust mass is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the dust injection rates of sne and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , respectively .",
    "the sn dust production rate is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the lower and upper mass limits for stars exploding as sne , @xmath21 is the mass of ejected metal yields per sn , @xmath22 is the sn dust production efficiency as defined in , @xmath23 is the sfr , @xmath24 is the main sequence lifetime of a star with mass @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the imf , normalized in the interval @xmath27 $ ] as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the low and high mass cutoffs for the adopted imf , respectively .",
    "the rate of dust destruction due to astration and shocks in the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively , is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass of interstellar material swept up and cleared of dust by a single sn , and @xmath33 is the sn rate .",
    "the dust - to - ism ratio is @xmath34 where @xmath35    the equation for the evolution of the gas mass is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rate of gaseous material returned to the ism .    finally , we assume a global star - formation law , inspired by the schmidt  kennicutt law @xcite , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the initial sfr and gas mass , and @xmath41 is the global schmidt  kennicutt exponent , usually taken to be 1.0 or 1.5 .",
    "we next introduce several simplifications which will allow us to capture the essentials ( but not the details ) of the chemical evolution equations :    we assume that sn yields are released into the ism instantly after the progenitor star is born , i.e. , @xmath42 , in which case @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the sn rate to sfr ratio .",
    "we ignore the contribution from agb stars or other sources to the evolution of the dust mass , so @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dust productivity , and @xmath49 the resulting equation for the evolution of the dust mass is @xmath50    we also assume that @xmath51 and that @xmath52 , so the evolution of gas mass is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant of proportionality close to unity , and @xmath55    we study imfs with @xmath56 with @xmath57 m@xmath11  and @xmath58 m@xmath11 , @xmath59 m@xmath11  and @xmath60 m@xmath11 , and maximum sn dust production efficiency , corresponding to an average dust yield per sn of @xmath610.4 m@xmath11@xcite .",
    "in particular , we study salpeter ( @xmath62 ) and bottom - light ( @xmath63 m@xmath11 ) imfs for which the conversions to chabrier imf sfrs are 1/1.8 and 3.0 ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ) . for a bottom - light ( salpeter ) imf , the approximate values of the parameters entering are @xmath64 ( 0.007 ) m@xmath11@xmath8 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( 0.003 ) , @xmath671500 m@xmath11 , and @xmath6830 .",
    "we next investigate simple analytical limiting cases at early and late times resulting from the above set of equations .      at early times",
    ", not much gas has been consumed , so @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus @xmath71 and so @xmath72 in other words the maximum attainable dust mass is @xmath73 and for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath76 . for a bottom - light imf ( @xmath77 ) , sne will turn of order 1% of the initial total mass into dust in the absence of dust destruction ( @xmath68 ) , independent of the initial sfr .    during this early phase ,",
    "the dust mass is proportional to the sfr and the duration of the starburst .",
    "however , this is not the @xmath0sfr relation we are seeking . to reach",
    "the dust levels observed , the galaxies would have been forming dust at a steady level for @xmath78 4 gyr ( for a salpeter imf ) .",
    "while in some cases such an interpretation may be viable ( e.g. , for the milky way , see hjorth et al .",
    "2014 ) , in general this time scale is uncomfortably long and the scenario is not expected to give rise to such a well - defined relation .      at late times , star formation will decrease because of the reduced availability of gas . as a consequence of the lower sn rate , there is less dust production .",
    "the dust destruction term is a combination of consumption through astration and grain destruction due to sn shocks .",
    "we seek a relation consistent with the @xmath0sfr relation and therefore make the _ ansatz _ @xmath79 from this follows that @xmath80 requiring the exponent of @xmath81 in equations ( 15 ) and ( 21 ) to be equal , i.e. , @xmath82 , yields @xmath83 .",
    "in other words , @xmath84 and hence @xmath85 , i.e. , a constant dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath86 , during the late , non - starbursting phase . indeed , requiring the prefactors of equations ( 15 ) and ( 21 ) to be equal , @xmath87 , shows that @xmath88 must be time independent .",
    "the net dust evolution term is negative and equals @xmath89 .",
    "note that for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , while for @xmath92 one retrieves the @xcite @xmath0sfr relation , @xmath93 .      for illustration",
    "we compute full chemical evolution models with an initial mass of @xmath94 m@xmath11 , initial sfrs corresponding to a chabrier sfr of @xmath95 m@xmath11 yr@xmath8 , a range of sn dust destruction clearing masses ( @xmath96=01500 m@xmath11 ) , and for salpeter or bottom - light imfs .    regarding the schmidt",
    " kennicutt slope ( exponent denoted by @xmath97 for surface densities , @xmath98 ) , @xcite found a slope of @xmath99 .",
    "@xcite argue on theoretical grounds that the local volumetric relation between sfr and gas should be @xmath100 .",
    "the models of @xcite however suggest the slope is closer to unity at high densities or sfrs , due to stellar feedback . indeed , find @xmath101 in resolved galaxies at @xmath102 while @xcite find @xmath103 for the relation between molecular mass and sfr in nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite find a non - universal slope whose average is @xmath104 ) .",
    "use @xmath105 in their models of proto e galaxies .",
    "we here compute models with @xmath41 ranging from 0.9 to 1.2 and evolve them over 10 gyr .",
    "we plot the models in figure  [ f : dacunha ] . as a benchmark model ( thick solid curve )",
    "we choose a bottom - light imf , no sn dust destruction , and @xmath92 to match the observed @xmath0sfr relation .",
    "the dashed curve shows the corresponding salpeter imf model , while the dotted curves show the effect of varying the sn dust destruction clearing mass , @xmath96 , for a bottom - light imf .",
    "these models confirm that the power - law slope of the @xmath0sfr relation at late times is consistent with @xmath106 .",
    "the differing imfs or clearing masses primarily affect the normalization of the curves .",
    "the imf has a strong effect on the total amount of dust produced , with bottom - light imfs leading to significantly ( up to an order of magnitude ) higher dust masses , for a fixed ( chabrier imf equivalent ) sfr , confirming previous findings .",
    "more massive systems ( not shown ) also lead to higher dust masses .",
    "thin solid lines show the effect of varying @xmath41 and confirms the expected @xmath106 behavior .",
    "we verified that incorporation of agb stars does not change the overall qualitative behaviour of the models presented here .",
    "as shown by @xcite , using chemical evolution models , the @xmath0sfr relation can be interpreted as an evolutionary sequence .",
    "this is partly confirmed by our analysis . in this picture , the initial phase is due to a starburst in which dust is built up at essentially constant star formation rate . due to the maximum attainable dust mass derived in section  [ early ] ,",
    "the smg data points are located , on average , below the extrapolation of the linear fit to the sdss data points @xcite .",
    "we note that to reproduce the highest dust masses , very efficient formation of dust from the metals produced by sne is required .",
    "the models do not reproduce such high dust masses .",
    "the high end of the @xmath0sfr relation is therefore further evidence for a surprisingly efficient and rapid dust formation process at work , such as that inferred from sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "presumably the dust is either formed directly in sne or through rapid subsequent grain growth in the ejecta / remnant or the ism , such that the majority of the refractory elements available are turned into dust .",
    "we note that , for the highest dust masses , significant sn dust destruction is not allowed by the models .",
    "the numerical models also confirm that the late evolution is characterized by a joint decay in dust mass and sfr rate which leads to a power - law relation between them , with a slope of @xmath106 .",
    "hence , the slope of the @xmath0sfr relation can be directly related to the global incarnation ( equation  [ schmidt ] ) of the schmidt ",
    "kennicutt star - formation law @xcite .",
    "we note that the commonly adopted value of @xmath90 is not favored by the models which seem to prefer values around @xmath107 .",
    "the joint decay in these quantities is due to a delicate balance between continued star and dust formation and the parallel consumption of the available gas ( and dust ) reservoir and through dust destruction by sn shocks .",
    "the balance is characterized by a roughly constant dust - to - gas ratio along the @xmath0sfr relation .",
    "we may consider the early and late phases to be two stages of star formation ; the first being the rapid starburst when all the dust is formed , the second being quiescently star - forming galaxies .",
    "of course , the `` initial '' starburst in the chemical evolution model need not necessarily refer to the very beginning of the evolution of a galaxy  it may for example relate to the time when a lot of gas ( @xmath108 ) is supplied to the galaxy ( e.g. , through a merger ) .",
    "it is also possible that some galaxies undergo several starbursts .",
    "other processes may be at work in shaping the @xmath0sfr diagram .",
    "quenching of star formation will lead to a rapid decline in the sfr . if this is due to removal of cold gas and dust from the galaxy ( e.g. , due to heating or expulsion , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a parallel decline in the dust mass will lead to a transition more or less parallel to the @xmath0sfr relation .",
    "however , if the star formation is quenched but the dust retained ( e.g. , when the cold gas reservoir , such as a gaseous galactic disk , becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps , so - called morphological quenching , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then a horizontal transition is expected .",
    "conversely , merging will produce a parallel upwards evolution along the @xmath0sfr relation , perhaps leading to a subsequent starburst .",
    "we stress that the evolutionary models plotted in figure  1 are for illustration and are not intended to account for all the data points being part of a single evolutionary sequence .",
    "notably , the _ herschel _ etgs and passive spirals ( red symbols ) appear , on average , to be offset from the relation ( blue points ) , with higher dust masses at a given sfr , or , equivalently , lower sfr at a given dust mass .",
    "part of the effect may be due to their average higher masses , a selection effect in that they are _ herschel _ detected , or morphological quenching as discussed above .",
    "long - time sustained low star formation from a large gas reservoir appears unlikely to account for the full effect given they are early - type galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the offsets of the _ herschel _ etgs and the smgs from the main relation are reminiscent of the similar offsets of such galaxies from the main sequence of star formation , i.e. , the @xmath109sfr relation .",
    "possibly , the smgs and the _ herschel _ etgs form a separate evolutionary sequence , characterized by a higher @xmath41 .    as suggested by the models , we expect a population of star - bursting galaxies significantly below the relation . because of the logarithmic scale and the short amount of time spent in this early phase , such galaxies may be rare .",
    "examples include the low - metallicity low - redshift dwarf galaxy starbursts i  zw  18 @xcite and sbs  0035@xmath110052 . at higher redshifts , entering the era of reionization",
    ", we expect most galaxies to have low dust content because of the limited time available since big bang and the onset of star formation",
    ". alma should uncover a significant population of very high redshift galaxies below the local relation . the @xmath111 galaxy ` himiko ' may be one such candidate @xcite .    given the heterogeneous data sets used , as well as the possible range of model parameters ( initial mass , sfr , and imf in particular ) and evolutionary processes entering",
    ", one expects quite some scatter in the relation , as revealed here .",
    "more homogeneous samples would be needed to model evolutionary sequences in more detail .",
    "we thank haley gomez , julie wardlow , sune toft , stefano zibetti , anna gallazzi , and darach watson for discussions , and elisabete da cunha and mark swinbank for making their data points available in electronic form .",
