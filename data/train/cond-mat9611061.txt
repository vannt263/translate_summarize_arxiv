    "the observation of bose einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold alkali gases has led to intensive experimental and theoretical investigations of the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "since the atomic gases of the experiments are dilute , and hence weakly interacting , their physical properties may be explored theoretically in terms of basic interatomic interactions and as a first approximation the interactions may be neglected  @xcite . this is strongly opposed to the physical properties of related phenomena such as superconductivity in metals and superfluidity in liquid he , which are fundamentally modified by strong interparticle interactions .    in the remarkable pioneering experiment @xcite @xmath0rb vapour",
    "was magnetically trapped and evaporatively cooled to approximately @xmath1 nk , where a finite fraction of the particles was observed to occupy the ground state .",
    "when further lowering the temperature this fraction increased abruptly , signalling a bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the confining magnetic field was a time - averaged , orbiting potential @xcite whose effective potential to first order is a three - dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator .",
    "the potential was not anisotropic in all three directions , but was cylindrically symmetric .",
    "shortly after , a similar experiment was performed with @xmath2na gas @xcite ; in this case the potential was completely anisotropic .    with these experiments in mind ,",
    "we will in the present paper extend our previous work on the thermodynamics of an ideal isotropic gas @xcite to the anisotropic case .",
    "although the interactions among the atoms are weak , they are quite important in the condensate . both experiments and theory show that due to the interaction the actual ground state is considerably larger than the single particle ground state .",
    "however , close to the transition temperature just a few particles occupy the ground state and the gas is much more dilute . at these temperatures",
    "one would believe that the ideal gas is a good approximation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been proposed that highly anisotropic traps may freeze out one or two dimensions , so that the system to a good approximation is lower dimensional .",
    "this implies that it is of interest to study these systems also , and we present a preliminary analysis of them in this work .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in the next section we study noninteracting bosons in a confining anisotropic harmonic potential in three dimensions ( 3@xmath3 ) . in the framework of the grand canonical ensemble we calculate the condensate fraction ,",
    "the internal energy and the heat capacity analytically using euler - maclaurin summation and compare with exact numerical summation . in section three",
    "we discuss the same system in one and two spatial dimensions . in particular , we study the effect of using different ensembles in one - dimensional systems . in section four",
    "we summarize and conclude .",
    "in this section we will discuss bose - einstein condensation in three - dimensional harmonic traps .",
    "firstly , we consider the isotropic potential and then we move on to the anisotropic trap .",
    "however , we would first like to discuss bose - einstein condensation and phase transitions in a more general setting , and comment upon earlier work .",
    "let us begin our discussion by considering free bosons in 3@xmath4 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 finite )",
    ". in this case one may show ( see any standard textbook in statistical mechanics ) that the fraction of particles in the ground state is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is defined through @xmath9 as can be seen from the above equation , @xmath8 defines the onset of the condensation of particles into the ground state .",
    "moreover , it can be demonstrated that the chemical potential vanishes for @xmath10 and that @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "thus , one can _ define _ the critical temperature to be the highest temperature for which @xmath13 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath14 with respect to temperature is discontinuous at @xmath15 , and so there is a first order phase transition .",
    "+   + generally , the chemical potential must satisfy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ground state energy of the system , in order to have positive occupation numbers . in  @xcite",
    ", kirsten and toms propose that a necessary criterion for bose - einstein condensation is that @xmath14 must reach the ground state energy @xmath17 at finite temperature . from this , they show that bec only occurs for free bosons when @xmath18 , when @xmath19 . ] and not for free bosons in a finite volume in three dimensions . in a system with a constant magnetic field",
    "it only happens in five or more dimensions .",
    "this latter result has also been verified independently by elmfors _",
    "+   + from theoretical work as well as from an experimental point of view we will argue that this criterion is somewhat too strict . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been demonstrated numerically that the chemical potential never reaches its critical value in the case of bosons in a confining harmonic potential . according to the criterion mentioned above , this system does not exhibit bec .",
    "however , the occupation number of the ground state changes considerably in a narrow temperature range , and attains a macroscopic value .",
    "more specifically , it has been shown ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that the condensate near @xmath20 varies as @xmath21 this abrupt change in number of particles in the ground state takes place near the temperature at which the heat capacity has a pronounced maximum ( which is @xmath22 ) .",
    "we would not hesitate to call this a condensation , although there is no critical behaviour and so it is not obvious how to define a critical temperature .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been proposed that the critical temperature is defined by the maximum of the specific heat . according to this criterion",
    "there is a phase transition in two and three dimensions , but not in one ( see also section three ) .",
    "we think is it natural to call the temperature @xmath22 the _ condensation temperature _ , since this temperature determines the onset of condensation of particles into the ground state .",
    "this view is supported by experiment , namely the fact that one has measured a large increase in the number of particles in the ground state over a narrow temperature region .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator hamiltonian can always be written as products of three eigenfunctions of the one - dimensional oscillator , which are hermite polynomials .",
    "hence , the eigenfunctions can be labeled by three integers @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the energy is @xmath26 in the isotropic case ( we have set the ground state energy to zero ) . each energy level can thus be characterized by a single quantum number @xmath27 and the corresponding degeneracy is @xmath28 , which simply is the number of ways of writing @xmath27 as the sum of the three positive integers @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath27 then takes the values @xmath29 . due to the high degree of symmetry of the isotropic harmonic",
    "well , there is another convenient basis set .",
    "the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath30 and @xmath31 and hence the eigenfunctions can be labeled by @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the energy .",
    "the eigenfunctions are laguerre polynomials times a spherical harmonic .",
    "+   + at temperature @xmath34 and chemical potential @xmath14 the particle number @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the usual bose - einstein distribution function . introducing the fugacity @xmath39",
    ", the ground state particle number may be written as @xmath40 the number of particles in excited states is then @xmath41 which is a function of the _ effective fugacity _",

    "now let us move on to actual calculations and consider different ways of handling eq .",
    "( [ free:1 ] ) . at high temperature @xmath44 , the difference between the terms in the sum is small , and one can approximate the sum by an integral .",
    "the dominating contribution at high @xmath34 is found by setting @xmath45 , leading to the semiclassical limit @xcite .",
    "the transition temperature , as defined by the temperature at which @xmath46 , is in this approximation , found to be @xcite @xmath47 in the same approximation the specific heat @xmath48 exhibits a discontinuity at this temperature with the shape of a @xmath49 .",
    "the discontinuity is however an artifact of the approximation .",
    "an exact numerical calculation @xcite reveals that @xmath48 is a continuous function of @xmath34 .",
    "this is a consequence of the finiteness of the particle number .    as discussed in @xcite , an efficient way of performing summations",
    "is given by the euler - maclaurin summation method @xcite .",
    "the sum is then written as an integral plus an infinite series of correction terms @xmath50   + \\frac{1}{12}[f'(b ) - f'(a ) ] + \\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] applying this formula to the sum over excited states , the contributions from the upper limit vanish ( it is natural to single out the ground state from the sum and use euler - maclaurin on the rest . moreover",
    ", the series converges much faster doing so ) .",
    "higher order derivatives mainly bring down higher powers of @xmath51 , although differentiation of the degeneracy factor yields small corrections to lower order . at high temperature",
    "we may therefore safely truncate the series . including only the first derivative",
    ", the number of excited particles becomes @xmath52 we have here introduced the functions @xmath53 these functions satisfy a simple recursion relation @xmath54 they can be expressed in terms of the more familiar polylogarithmic functions @xmath55 which are generalizations of the riemann @xmath56-function . for @xmath57 and @xmath58",

    "@xcite .",
    "the potentials used in the experiments  @xcite are either partially or completely asymmetric .",
    "we therefore need expressions for the cases where the frequencies are different .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath65 . as for the isotropic potential we use the euler - maclaurin formula for each of the sums .",
    "the calculations are similar and we skip the details .",

    "it has a maximum value of @xmath88 , quite close to the semiclassical value @xmath89 .",
    "all bec - experiments on trapped bose gases reported so far are performed on three - dimensional systems .",

    "this could either be based on perturbation theory or some nonperturbative method .",
    "there are already a few articles on the subject  @xcite , but more work needs to be done .",
