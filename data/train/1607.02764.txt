    "the spin can diffuse to lower density while keeping its magnetization direction unchanged , or diffuse to a different magnetization direction , corresponding to longitudinal and transverse spin diffusion . for the latter case",

    "this spin dynamics has been extensively studied in liquid helium @xcite and solid state systems @xcite .",
    "recently this diffusion physics attracts much attention in cold atoms @xcite .",
    "compared to conventional system , cold atomic systems can realize a new regime , i.e. , a strongly interacting unitary regime , where the @xmath0-wave scattering length diverges and the system shows universal behaviors @xcite . for fermi gases , the diffusion constant @xmath1 should be greater than @xmath2 in the unitary regime , where @xmath3 is the fermi velocity and @xmath4 is the scattering lifetime with mean - free path @xmath5 lager than the interparticle spacing @xmath6 .",
    "this lowest bound has been observed in various cold atoms measurement @xcite , except for a two - dimensional experiment @xcite .",
    "experimentally this diffusion constant is get by fitting the demagnetization data to the solution of a homogeneous diffusion equation , whereas the system is placed in a harmonic trap . in the limit of zero scattering lifetime , the mean - free path will go to zero , which means the scattering atoms can not move and feel the potential of other places . in this case",
    ", the inhomogeneity of the system can be somehow ignored and one can use a uniform diffusion equation to describe the system .",
    "however the experimental lowest bound for diffusion constant @xmath7 indicates a finite scattering lifetime .",
    "recent experiment also shows large deviation from homogeneous diffusion equation , especially at weak interaction where the scattering lifetime increases @xcite .",
    "enss has studied the potential effect and show that it can sufficiently revise the diffusive process @xcite .",
    "so it is necessary to consider the position dependent to the spin diffusion and understand how the scattering lifetime will change this process . in the following , we will give an exact solution to the diffusion equation in a harmonic trap , and show how the scattering lifetime will slow down the demagnetization process .",
    "we will study high temperature limit , when the leggett - rice effect could be ignored and one could focus on how the diffusive dynamics is corrected in a trap system .    in this paper , we will study the transverse spin diffusion in ultracold fermions .",
    "we consider a two - component fermi gas placed in a cigar shape trap . like the experiment in @xcite",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we give our model and provide the solution to non - interaction boltzmann equation . by solving the fokker - planck - like diffusion equation , we give an analytical result of the demagnetization process . then to check the validity of our result",

    "the distribution function evolves according to the equation of motion ( em ) : @xmath31\\right>$ ] , which will give us the boltzmann equation for @xmath32 .    before going further ,",
    "let s first see what the trap potential do in the non - interaction case .",
    "since we are interested in the transverse dynamics here , from the em the non - interaction boltzmann equation for the transverse distribution function @xmath33 gives @xmath34 where the second term on the left describes the drift of particles due to the real space gradient and is the origin of spin diffusion .",
    "the third and forth terms on the left account for the change of phase space densities by the inhomogeneous trap and the magnetic field . without the magnetic field gradient ,",
    "the system is in a equilibrium state where all the spins are polarized in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "let s consider a high temperature case with @xmath35 , where we have set @xmath36 .",
