    "identification of possible mechanisms of heating of solar coronal plasma and acceleration of solar wind is among the unsolved problems of solar physics . in the last two decades",
    "there has been intensive theoretical work undertaken to advocate the idea of coronal plasma heating by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves . in particular",
    ", it has been suggested that coronal loops could be heated by dissipation of high frequency slow magnetoacoustic waves ( porter , klimchuk & sturrock 1994a , b ; laing & edwin 1995 ) .",
    "however , up until recent observational advances , these studies have been poorly motivated because of the absence of observational evidence of the mhd wave activity in the solar corona .",
    "recent observations performed with soho / eit and trace imaging telescopes have established :    \\1 .",
    "existence of upward propagating perturbations of euv brightness in long coronal loops at the bandpasses eit 195  ( berghmans & clette 1999 ) and trace 171",
    "( berghmans et al .",
    "1999 , de moortel , ireland & walsh 2000 ) , and eit 195  and trace 171simultaneously ( robbrecht et al .",
    "probably , the same phenomenon was observed by nightingale , aschwanden & hurlburt ( 1999 ) in trace 171  .",
    "the projected velocities of these plasma density perturbations are about 65 - 165 km / s , which is below the sound speed corresponding to the temperature of the loop .",
    "the amplitude is usually 1 - 3% of the background density , reaching 5 - 6% in some observations .",
    "the propagating disturbances are quasi - periodic with the periods of 3 - 20 min .",
    "there is no a well - defined correlation between the periods and physical parameters of the loops detected .",
    "the disturbances are detected in the loop legs near footpoints and always propagate upwards .",
    "there are no observations of waves propagating downwards .",
    "two rival interpretations of the propagating disturbances have been suggested . in the first ( reale , peres & serio 2000 ) , the disturbances are considered as field - aligned flows of matter , generated by the siphon effect . in the second",
    "( nakariakov et al .",
    "2000 ) , the propagating disturbances are associated with slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "the wave - based theory is similar to the model developed for the interpretation of compressive perturbations observed in polar plumes ( ofman , nakariakov & deforest 1999 , ofman , nakariakov & sehgal 2000 ) in terms of slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "both theories are consistent with the observations and with the mhd theory , but the flow - based model has difficulties with explanation of the periodicity and the symmetry of the front and back edges of the disturbance .",
    "also , the observations do not show a change ( acceleration ) in the propagating disturbance speed , predicted by the flow - based theory .",
    "in contrast , the wave - based theory explains all the observational findings and , in particular , justifies the absence of downward propagating disturbances .    in the wave - based theory ( nakariakov at al .",
    "2000 ) , it has been established that the main physical factors , which are important in the slow magnetoacoustic wave dynamics in long coronal loops , include : ( i ) gravitational stratification , which is responsible for wave amplitude amplification ; ( ii ) dissipation , which leads to the conversion of wave kinetic energy into heat in the large wave numbers part of the spectrum , and ( iii ) nonlinearity , which generally yields wave front steepening by generation of higher harmonics , leading to enhanced dissipation . an evolutionary equation for the slow magnetoacoustic wave amplitude has been derived , which includes these three effects . however , in order to catch the physical essence of the problem without further complications , simple geometry of the loop , namely , zero inclination angle and zero offset of the centre from the solar surface has been assumed .",
    "in contrast , observations show that the plane of a loop is not necessary perpendicular to the sun s surface ( a non - zero inclination ) and the centre of the loop circle is usually situated below the surface ( a non - zero offset ) ( e.g. aschwanden et al .",
    "consequently , a more elaborate theory of the slow magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops , which includes the effects of the non - zero inclination and the non - zero offset , is required .",
    "soft x - ray and euv coronal telescopes provide the possibility to determine the distribution of density , temperature and heat deposition along a loop .",
    "priest et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , using yohkoh / sxt observations concluded that hot , soft x - ray loops were heated uniformly .",
    "aschwanden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , aschwanden , nightingale & alexander ( 2000 ) and aschwanden , schrijver & alexander ( 2001 ) analyzing soho / eit and trace euv observations argued that cooler loops were heated non - uniformly , near the loop footpoints .",
    "the specific mechanism for the energy deposition remains unknown and could , in principle , be associated with dissipation of slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "de moortel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have estimated the energy of slow waves observed to be insufficient to heat a loop .",
    "this result was based upon the assumption of the wave to be a single harmonic with the period of several minutes .",
    "but , currently available resolution of the telescopes does not allow us to detect periodic motions with the periods shorter than a few minutes , even if they are presented in the spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , the absence of well - defined period in the loop waves suggests that their spectrum is probably continuous and not a single harmonic .",
    "we would like to point out that the main difficulty with the theory of coronal loop heating by dissipation of slow magnetoacoustic waves has been connected with the absence of the observational evidence of these waves in the corona .",
    "it has been believed that the waves somehow generated below the temperature minimum , are not able to penetrate through this layer .",
    "now , the observational evidence of the long period longitudinal waves has been provided .",
    "the long period waves can have unresolved shorter period components in their spectrum . according to the theory , these short period spectral components",
    "dissipate very quickly , and deposit the energy in the near footpoint part of the loop legs .    in this paper",
    "we develop further the model of nakariakov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for one - dimensional slow magnetoacoustic waves in stratified coronal loops , taking into account the effects of the non - zero loop plane inclination angle and the semi - circular loop offset , and derive a generalized evolutionary equation for slow magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops .",
    "it is shown that a coronal loop acts as a dissipative filter on the slow magnetoacoustic waves and that the short wavelength part of the wave spectrum dissipates in the nearest vicinity of the loop footpoints . by calculating the heat deposition rate , provided by the dissipation of the slow waves and comparing it with",
    "the observationally determined heat deposition rate in euv loops , we show that sufficiently wide spectrum slow waves can deposit the required amount of energy in the lower parts of the loops , which is consistent with observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we formulated our generalized model in section  2 ; section  3 deals with the comparison of our model s predictions with the observations ; and , finally , in section 4 we close with a discussion of our main results .",
    "we consider a semi - circular loop of the curvature radius @xmath0 . the loop cross - section is taken to be constant .",
    "validity of the latter assumption has been corroborated by klimchuk et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and by aschwanden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for soft x - ray and euv loops , respectively .",
    "the loop is filled with a gravitationally stratified magnetized plasma of constant temperature . here , we generalize nakariakov et al.s ( 2000 ) work by incorporating effects of loop plane inclination and offset of circular loop centre from the baseline .",
    "this is necessary since actually observed loops have the non - zero ( measured from the normal to the solar surface ) inclination angle @xmath1 and non - zero offset of circular loop centre from baseline , @xmath2 , i.e. distance from the circle s centre to the solar surface .",
    "the sketch of the model geometry is shown in figure  1 .    the gravitational acceleration projected on the loop tangential at any point which is located at a distance",

    "2 demonstrates the behaviour of a harmonic wave in identical loops with different values of the inclination angle @xmath1 .",
    "naturally , the increase of the inclination angle decreases the value of the maximum amplitude the wave can reach .",
    "indeed , larger inclination angle means less stratification of the plasma density in the loop , therefore lower maximal values .",
    "3 shows the evolution of the wave amplitude along the loop for different offsets of a circular loop centre from the baseline , @xmath2 .",
    "the increase in the loop centre offset leads to the decrease of the loop length and also decreases the angle between the loop leg and the surface of the sun at the footpoint .",
    "the length of the loop is @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , the increase in @xmath2 reduces the effective stratification of the loop density and this results in lower maximal amplitudes reached by the waves .",
    "( [ eveqs ] ) describes evolution of the spectral component @xmath31 . in the exponent ,",
    "the first term is positive in the ascending stage of the wave propagation , becomes zero when the wave reaches the loop apex and then becomes negative .",
    "the second term is always negative .",
    "consequently , in the ascending stage , the wave evolution is described by the competition of these two terms describing effects of stratification and dissipation , respectively .",
    "importantly , these two mechanisms operate in different spectral domains . mathematically",
    ", eq .  ( [ eveqs ] ) is similar to an evolutionary equation of a dissipative filter in the theory of radio circuits .",
    "therefore , a coronal loop acts on slow magnetoacoustic waves as a dissipative filter . if we knew the initial spectrum of the wave , the equation would allow us to determine the spectrum at each given height @xmath3 of the loop .",
    "unfortunately , the initial spectrum , especially its short wavelength part , can not be determined with the current resolution of euv telescopes .",
    "evolution of the spectrum is accompanied by the dissipation of spectral components .",
    "different spectral components have different effective scale heights of the dissipation . assuming the initial wave spectrum and following the spectrum evolution along the loop",
    ", we can determine the energy deposition rate at each given height @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , this function can be tested against the observations .    in order to compare predictions of our model with the observational data",
    ", we have investigated the behaviour of different slow magnetoacoustic wave spectral components in the _ average euv loop _ determined by aschwanden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , with @xmath41  mm , @xmath42  mm , @xmath43 , corresponding to the loop length of about @xmath44  mm . the evolution of different spectral components is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the dissipative coefficient @xmath45 has the same value as was estimated in ( nakariakov et al .",
    "the spectral components corresponding to shorter wavelengths ( i.e. shorter period ) dissipate faster and closer to the loop footpoint .",
    "the initial spectrum of the slow waves , @xmath46 is unknown , but it should satisfy certain criteria . according to observations ,",
    "the spectrum should have a maximum in the vicinity of 180420  s. the velocity amplitude of the maximum is about 13% of the speed of sound . perhaps , there are also maxima in the shorter period part of the spectrum , but they have not been resolved observationally .",

    "recently observed variations of euv emission intensity , propagating upward along the legs of solar coronal loops , are satisfactory interpreted in terms of the slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "we generalized the model of the slow wave evolution in a loop , suggested by nakariakov et al .",
    "2000 by taking into account effects of loop plane inclination and offset of the semi - circular loop centre from the solar surface .",
    "an evolutionary equation which governs the wave propagation in presence of gravitational stratification and dissipation was derived .",
    "both non - zero inclination and offset affect the slow wave evolution , reducing the stratification of the loop plasma and , consequently , the amplitude growth of the upward propagating waves .",
    "it was found that coronal loops act as dissipative filters of slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "different spectral components have different dissipation lengths and the wave spectrum evolves with height or with the distance along the loop .",
    "therefore , the amount of wave energy deposited in the loop decreases with the height and the wave dissipation deposits the energy in the lower parts of the loops . making certain assumptions about the spectrum of the waves near the loop footpoints",
    ", we constructed a function describing the wave energy flux dissipated into heat in a loop segment .",
    "this function was compared with an observationally determined function approximating the nonuniform heat deposition requirements .",
    "we conclude , that the observed heat deposition into coronal loops can be interpreted as dissipation of slow magnetoacoustic waves , provided the wave spectrum is sufficiently wide .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with previously obtained results by porter et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) , but is based upon recently obtained observational information on the actual existence and parameters of slow magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops and on the nonuniform distribution of heat deposition in euv loops .",
    "in the scenario proposed , the short wave length components of the slow wave spectrum , with short dissipation lengths , are filtered out in the loop legs , depositing the energy and heating the loops near the footpoints , while the long wave length spectral components , with longer dissipation lengths , propagate further and are detected by euv telescopes .",
    "strictly speaking , realistic spectrum of slow magnetoacoustic waves is restricted by the acoustic cutoff wave number from below and by the inverse mean free path length from above . however",
    ", this does not seem to affect the results obtained , as the impact of the long wavelength ( lower frequency ) part of the spectrum to heating is weak and as the short wavelength slow waves are efficiently dissipated in the collisionless regime too , depositing the energy near the loop footpoints .",
    "therefore , the theoretical results on the slow wave dissipation are consistent with the phenomenological results on euv coronal loop heating and with the observed amplitude of the waves in the long wavelength part of the spectrum .",
    "the wide spectrum slow magnetoacoustic waves can , indeed , deposit sufficient amount of energy near the loop footpints , which is in agreement with the observations of aschwanden et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this possibility is purely theoretical due to not yet fully observed spectrum of the slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "however , our results indicate that the slow waves can not be excluded from the consideration as a possible mechanism for heating of the coronal loops .",
