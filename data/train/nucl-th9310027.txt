    "the apparent success of the one - body picture in explaining the quasi - elastic @xmath9 results was put in a different perspective when the longitudinal and transverse response functions were experimentally separated . in the one - body picture",

    "notwithstanding the extensive amount of work which has been devoted to a theoretical understanding of the separated @xmath9 data , a full explanation of both response functions in a consistent model has not yet been accomplished @xcite .",
    "recent coincidence @xmath1 measurements have established the significant role played by multinucleon mechanisms in the quasi - elastic @xcite , dip @xcite and @xmath10-excitation domain @xcite .",
    "the existence of multinucleon mechanisms was evidenced through a rise in the measured transverse @xmath1 response functions at high missing energies e@xmath11=@xmath12-t@xmath13 in the ( a-1 ) system @xcite .",
    "this excess strength has been shown to be unlikely due to rescattering effects , since a comparable rise of the longitudinal strength would then be expected , an effect which has not been observed experimentally .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recent measurements of the separate @xmath1 structure functions indicate that a similar situation seems to occur as for the inclusive @xmath9 cross sections : whereas the one - body picture gives a fair account of the complete quasi - elastic @xmath1 cross sections for reactions in which the residual nucleus is created in a hole state @xcite , discrepancies turn up when it comes to comparing the separated structure functions @xcite . in a recent paper",
    "we have illustrated the particular sensitivity of the longitudinal - transverse @xmath1 response function to multihadron currents related to pion - exchange and @xmath10 excitation @xcite .    whereas the gathered evidence for electron scattering reactions proceeding in part via multinucleon components is relatively new , over the years overwhelming evidence for",
    "the occurrence of multinucleon components in real photon reactions has been produced . rather than attempting to be complete",
    "we mention some illustrative examples .    1 .   using the tagged photon technique , a glasgow - edinburgh - mainz collaboration succeeded in measuring the @xmath3c photoproton cross section up to high excitation energies in the residual nucleus @xcite . just as for the @xmath3c@xmath1 results of refs .",

    "@xcite have been confirmed by several independent measurements @xcite .",
    "strong indications for the occurrence of multinucleon mechanisms have also been obtained for the exclusive regime . for a long time",
    "it has been realized that exclusive @xmath4 reactions at high photon energies are good candidates to reveal information about the role of multihadron currents in photoinduced reactions .",
    "only one experiment of this type has been reported up to now .",
    "exclusive @xmath5o@xmath6o@xmath14 measurements at mit - bates @xcite confirmed the similarity of @xmath15 and @xmath16 angular cross sections for photon energies ranging from just above the particle emission threshold , which are typically probing the giant resonance region , to the @xmath10-production region .",
    "this is rather surprising given the uncharged nature of the neutron and the fact that the squared ratio of the respective magnetic moments @xmath17 equals 2.13 .",
    "3 .   as a third illustrative example of obvious multinucleon components showing up in photonuclear reactions , we mention the high - resolution @xmath3c@xmath0 measurements of refs . @xcite and the high - resolution @xmath18ca@xmath0 measurements of ref .",

    "a similar strong feeding of the @xmath19 states has been observed in the recent @xmath3c@xmath1 measurements at high missing momenta at nikhef - amsterdam @xcite .",
    "clearly , photonuclear reactions offer a good testing ground for any model that aims at describing the multihadron mechanisms in electromagnetically induced nucleon emission reactions .",
    "in addition , the similarities in some of the qualitative features of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are so obvious that a combined analysis is likely to result in a better insight in both types of reactions",
    ". this procedure might be particularly useful to arrive at a better quantitative understanding of the physics of the dip and the @xmath10 region , for which the @xmath1 spectra exhibit similar qualitative features as their @xmath0 counterparts @xcite .",
    "the multinucleon mechanisms in photonuclear reactions have been customary interpreted in terms of the phenomenological quasideuteron ( qd ) model @xcite in which the photon is assumed to be predominantly absorbed by @xmath20 pairs .",
    "this model gives a natural explanation of the measured excess strength in the @xmath0 and @xmath4 spectra at high missing energies . in the qd phenomenology",
    "the measured nucleon is not exclusive and is accompanied by an other nucleon which remains either undetected or gets reabsorbed .",
    "the quasideuteron phenomenology has been confirmed by double coincidence measurements of the type @xmath21 @xcite . in line with the predictions of the quasideuteron model ,",
    "the @xmath21 data were shown to scale with the missing momentum @xmath22 , the p dependence being determined by the probability of finding in the target nucleus a @xmath20 pair with total momentum @xmath23 and zero separation .    in this paper",

    ". our main focus will be on estimating the effect of two - nucleon emission processes to @xmath2 cross sections starting from principal grounds .",
    "this involves a microscopic model for the photoabsorption mechanism and a treatment of the final state interaction between the escaping nucleons and the residual nucleus . concerning the final state interaction , we rely on a shell - model approach to deal with the distortions that the struck nucleons undergo in their way out of the nucleus .",
    "by doing this we do not have to worry about spurious contributions to the cross sections due to non - orthogonality problems . within this shell - model framework for the treatment of the final state interaction",

    "remark further the considerable amount of measured photoproton strength in the region of the @xmath8 threshold at @xmath128 . in the process of calculating the contribution of exclusive one - nucleon knockout to the @xmath18ca@xmath0 spectrum , we considered removal from the @xmath116 and @xmath129 shell in addition to the 1d@xmath130 orbit .",
    "the effect of the final state interaction of the struck nucleons with the residual nucleus has been estimated by doing the @xmath3c@xmath0 calculations at @xmath127=150  mev , with a plane wave description for the outgoing nucleon pair and comparing the results with the full distorted - wave cross sections . in the formalism outlined in sect .",
    "ii , a plane wave description can be simply achieved by replacing the partial waves @xmath39 by properly normalized spherical bessel functions . in passing it",
    "is worth mentioning that the plane wave ( pw ) description does no longer guarantee the orthogonality between the inital and final states , such that spurious contributions could enter the cross sections . from fig .",
    "[ emdepen ] it becomes obvious that the effect of the distortions on the angular cross sections is not too dramatic , but for the region just above the threshold ( t@xmath131=100  mev ) .",
    "this particular behaviour can be easily explained by considering that from energy - conservation arguments a fast moving proton will be necessarily accompanied by a slow neutron , and therefore one of the outgoing nucleons will be subject to strong interactions with the residual system .    in fig .",
    "[ emdepen ] the effect of different absorption mechanisms is also studied . from the curves drawn in fig .",
    "[ emdepen ] it is clear that even at photonenergies as low as 150  mev a considerable fraction of the @xmath8 strength at backward proton angles is related to the resonant terms in the nuclear current . in passing it is worth mentioning that strictly speaking also the @xmath7 channel could be expected to contribute to the @xmath0 spectra . within our model assumptions",
    ", the @xmath7 channel can only be fed through the @xmath10 diagrams of fig .",
    "[ absor ] .",
    "the other diagrams are closed for two - proton emission since they involve a charge - exchange mechanism . in line with the experimental observations @xcite",
    ", however , the calculated @xmath7 strength represents but a small fraction of the photoabsorption strength emerging in the @xmath8 channel @xcite .",
    "as will become clear in the fortcoming subsection , this finding even holds in the region of the @xmath10 resonance .      from the results presented in previous subsection",
    ", it emerged that there are strong indications that at high excitation energies in the residual nucleus the measured @xmath2 cross sections should not be interpreted as the result of an exclusive process but reflect substantial two - nucleon knockout contributions . in this sense , the @xmath2 spectra above the two - nucleon emission threshold ,",
    "could be expected to be largely set by the physics of @xmath25 processes .",
    "the latter type of reactions , however , offer some supplementary degrees of freedom which might be worth exploiting in order to reach a better understanding of two - nucleon mechanisms in finite nuclei . at present ,",
    "a full determination of the fivefold differential cross sections @xmath132 is clearly at the edge of experimental feasibility .",
    "recently , however , several labs have produced double coincidence data at fixed kinematical conditions for one of the outgoing nucleons @xcite . to calculate the measured cross sections",
    ", we can employ eq .",
    "( [ gncross ] ) .",
    "this expression was derived by integrating the full coincidence @xmath25 cross section over one of the outgoing nucleon coordinates and produced the predictions for the two - nucleon components in the @xmath2 spectra . in order to get some idea regarding the realistic character of the proposed @xmath24 model",
    ", it is worth checking its predictions against the data . here , we present some calculations under the kinematical conditions of the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results of the @xmath5o@xmath21 and @xmath5o@xmath133 calculations at @xmath127=281  mev and different values of the proton energy are summarized in figs .",
    "[ gpn1 ] and [ gpn2 ] . at this photonenergy",
    "the cross sections are dominated by the @xmath10 current .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath133 cross sections are found to exhibit similar characteristics .",
    "for the high kinetic energies , the angular cross sections are clearly forwardly peaked . with decreasing proton",
    "kinetic energy flatter distributions are obtained .",
    "the data compromise the proton energy dependence of the cross section at a fixed proton angle ( @xmath134 ) . the comparison with the data",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ gpn3 ] . at low proton energies ,",
    "the calculated @xmath133 and @xmath21 clearly underestimate the data .",
    "this region is usually interpreted as being dominated by pion production .",
    "our calculations seem to suggest that even at low proton kinetic energies there is a considerable background of direct two - nucleon emission .",
    "apart from the pion knockout , also three and more nucleon knockout processes will preferentially feed the low proton energy domain of the spectrum . for lack of a microscopic theory for three and more nucleon ejection processes ,",
    "explicit @xmath135 measurements will be needed to gain insight into the pionproduction channels . at higher kinetic energies ,",
    "the calculations give a reasonable account of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 emission channel .",
    "the dashed curve for the @xmath133 channel is the cross section obtained with a plane - wave description for the escaping protons .",
    "it is clear that the distortion effects from the fsi reduce the peak of the cross section and are substantial in explaining the data .",
    "remark further how the background of @xmath7 strength at low proton energies can be partly ascribed to fsi effects .",
    "the @xmath7 cross sections are about one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath8 cross sections , a feature which is nicely reproduced by the calculations .",
    "summarizing , we have presented a microscopic study of multinucleon mechanisms in photoinduced nucleon - knockout processes .",
    "our study encompasses both inclusive and exclusive photonucleon processes in addition to two - nucleon knockout reactions .    in the exclusive regime",
    ", we have reported on @xmath5o@xmath16 results above the pion - production threshold . here",
    ", the predominant role of pionic degrees of freedom , including the @xmath10 excitation , in photonucleon processes is striking .",
    "our main focus has been on the contribution from two - nucleon knockout to the inclusive photonucleon spectra .",
    "the description relies on an unfactorized approach to two - nucleon knockout reactions .",
    "the fair description of the @xmath5o@xmath21 and @xmath5o@xmath133 data , makes us feel rather confident about the realistic character of the employed two - nucleon knockout formalism . regarding the @xmath2 processes",
    ", we have shown that at higher missing energies the @xmath8 emission strength largely exceeds the strength related to one - nucleon removal from the deep - lying hole states .",
    "we find our model , which accounts for photoabsorption on the resonant and non - resonant pion currents , to give a reasonable description of the general features of the @xmath2 spectra at high excitation energies in the residual nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , the calculations tend to selectively underestimate the available @xmath3c@xmath0 and @xmath3c@xmath4 spectra above the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "this is particularly the case at forward nucleon angles and higher missing energies .",
    "this feature , together with the observation that quite some strength resides in the region of the @xmath8 threshold , points towards other mechanisms , besides @xmath8 emission , contributing to the photonucleon processes with excitation of the residual nucleus in a continuum state . it would be worth investigating this in more detail , particularly in view of the fact that recent calculations predict the short - range effects to occur mainly at high excitation energies @xcite .    finally , we stress that the techniques adopted in this paper can be easily applied to @xmath136 and @xmath137 processes .",
    "it is to be hoped that a combined analysis of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra , together with new data from @xmath24 and @xmath137 measurements , will lead to a better insight into the nature of the multinucleon mechanisms in electromagnetically induced nucleon knockout . given their particular sensitivity to multinucleon mechanisms , reactions with real photons will play a substantial role in this program .",
