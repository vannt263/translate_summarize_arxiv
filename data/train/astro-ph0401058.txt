    "x - ray spectra of black - hole x - ray binaries in the hard state and seyfert-1 galaxies usually consist of a power - law with a high - energy cutoff , compton reflection , and fe k@xmath2 emission ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ; zdziarski et al .  1995 ; nandra et al .",
    "the cut - off power law is produced , most likely , by thermal comptonization in a hot , mildly relativistic , plasma ( see , e.g. , zdziarski & gierliski 2004 for a review ) .",
    "physical models for the hot plasma include a hot accretion disc , which we will discuss below , a magnetic - dominated corona ( e.g. , galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ; haardt & maraschi 1993 ; beloborodov 1999a ) , and an ion - illuminated accretion disc ( spruit & haardt 2000 ; deufel & spruit 2000 ) . among them , the hot accretion disc model has the most clear dynamics and fewest free parameters , and we concentrate on that model in this paper .",
    "shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 , hereafter sle ) proposed the first hot accretion - disc solution .",
    "the available gravitational energy is converted in the process of viscous dissipation into the thermal energy of ions , which are much heavier than electrons .",
    "since the only coupling between ions and electrons is coulomb collisions which is rather weak , and the radiation of electrons is much stronger than that of ions , the ion temperature , @xmath3 , is much higher than that of electrons , @xmath0 .",
    "the thomson optical depth of the flow , @xmath1 , is low , so @xmath0 can be as high as @xmath4k , high enough to produce x - ray photons .",
    "the sle solution is thermally unstable ( pringle 1976 ) .",
    "in addition , energy advection , which can be very important , is neglected in the energy equation of ions in sle .",
    "the second hot accretion - disc solution , advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al .  1982",
    "; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; see reviews by narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ; kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 ) , does include advection , which dominates the energy transfer for ions .",
    "the ion energy equation reads @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the rates of energy advection , viscous heating and coulomb cooling , respectively . in a typical adaf , due to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , i.e.",
    ", the viscous heating is balanced by advection cooling .",
    "we define a dimensionless accretion rate as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass accretion rate , and @xmath13 is the eddington luminosity ( note that in this definition we have not included the factor of 0.1 used by , e.g. , narayan & yi 1995 ) . with the increase of @xmath14 , since @xmath15 whereas @xmath16 , @xmath17 increases faster than @xmath7 , coulomb cooling becomes more and more important . when @xmath14 reaches a critical value , denoted as @xmath18 here , we will have @xmath19 , so advection fails to be the dominant cooling mechanism .",
    "we call @xmath18 the critical rate of adaf ( narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath18 and their low radiation efficiency make adafs rather dim .",
    "therefore , this solution is very successful in explaining low luminosity / quiescent states of black - hole binaries and low - luminosity agns .",
    "however , it is not clear whether it applies to luminous x - ray sources such as seyfert-1 galaxies and the luminous hard state of black - hole binaries .",
    "then , yuan ( 2001 , hereafter paper i ) found a new hot accretion solution above @xmath18 , the so - called luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf ) .",
    "we emphasize that the equations describing lhaf are completely identical to those of adaf , so lhaf is actually a natural extension of adaf to accretion rates above @xmath18 . in an lhaf , @xmath20",
    ", so we have @xmath21 .",
    "the reason why hot solutions still exist above @xmath18 is that the compression work , @xmath22 , provides additional heating in addition to @xmath7 , so @xmath23 ( see paper i for details ) if @xmath14 is not too large . since @xmath24 , advection plays a heating rather than a cooling role in lhaf .",
    "in other words , the entropy of the accretion flow in an lhaf is converted into radiation , similar to the cases of spherical accretion and cooling flow in galactic clusters is not very large , because the radiative cooling rate , @xmath25 , is very low at large radii .",
    "such solutions were not presented in paper i. we find that they do exist , but only in a narrow range of @xmath14 .",
    "this narrowness is , in fact , due to the definition of lhaf as satisfying @xmath26 .",
    "if , instead , we define lhaf solutions as those satisfying @xmath27 , we would have found the corresponding adaf - lhaf transition solutions in a wider range of @xmath14 .",
    "this is because at @xmath28 , @xmath29where @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "the two cases become identical at small radii , @xmath31 . ] .    a unified description of the three hot accretion disc models , namely the sle solution , adaf and lhaf , has been presented in yuan ( 2003 ) .",
    "yuan ( 2003 ) has also shown that if thermal conduction is neglected , lhaf is thermally unstable under local perturbations .",
    "however , the timescale of the growth of the thermal perturbations is in general longer than the accretion timescale if @xmath14 is not too large , despite the relatively strong radiative cooling in lhaf , so the solution can survive .",
    "furthermore , inclusion of thermal conduction generally has a very strong stabilizing effect .    from adaf to lhaf",
    ", both the accretion rate and the radiation efficiency increase continuously ( but the efficiency is still lower than in the standard thin disc ) , so lhafs are significantly more luminous than adafs .",
    "thus , lhafs offer a promising solution to the problem of the nature of x - ray emission of luminous accreting black holes . here , by comparing the predictions of the adaf and lhaf solutions for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the bolometric flow luminosity , @xmath32 , with results of fits to hard x - ray observations , we investigate which of these two solutions is more appropriate to describe the nature of x - ray emission of luminous black hole sources .",
    "x - ray emission of seyfert galaxies and black - hole binaries in the hard state is most likely due to thermal comptonization of soft photon by thermal hot electrons . for a given geometry ,",
    "the thermal - comptonization spectrum is determined by two parameters of the hot plasma , the electron temperature , @xmath0 , and the thompson optical depth , @xmath1 .",
    "fits with this model , summarized in section [ compton ] below , provide observational constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as on @xmath32 .",
    "we then compare them with the values predicted by the adaf and lhaf global solutions .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the exact cooling mechanism of electrons remains unknown .",
    "in particular , comptonization of synchrotron radiation photons may be not the dominant process in luminous x - ray sources .",
    "evidence supporting this point includes a correlation between the strength of compton reflection and the x - ray spectral index ( zdziarski , lubiski , & smith 1999 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "2003 ) and theoretical arguments showing that this process is often not capable to provide the required flux of seed photons required ( sle ; zdziarski et al .  1998 ; wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ) .",
    "sources of soft photons other than the synchrotron emission are , however , very likely to exist .",
    "the soft photons can come from a cold disc just outside of , or penetrating into , an inner hot accretion flow , if the truncation radius of the cold disc is not too large ( poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "another possibility is that the accretion flow consists of two phases , with some cold clouds or clumps embedded in the hot accretion gas ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; celotti , fabian & rees 1992 ; kuncic , celloti & rees 1997 ; krolik 1998 ) . in this case",
    ", the emission from the clumps can serve as the seed photons of comptonization .",
    "there is also very strong observational evidence for cold medium extending close to the black hole in seyferts and black - hole binaries from relativistic broadening of the reflection / reprocessing features ( e.g. , nandra et al .",
    "1997 ; ycki , done & smith 1998 ) . in accord with those observations , the lhaf model predicts that when @xmath33 is very high , the hot flow can collapse and form an optically - thick disc in the innermost region ( paper i ) , which disc will also be a copious source of soft photons .    for those reasons",
    ", the determination of the electron energy equation can be very complicated .",
    "an approach to overcome this difficulty is to parameterize the energy equation of electrons using the compton parameter , @xmath34 where @xmath35 corresponds to the disc scale height , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the thomson cross section , @xmath38 is the electron rest energy , and @xmath39 is the electron density .",
    "a given value of @xmath40 corresponds quite well to the x - ray photon index @xmath41 ( ghisellini & haardt 1994 ; poutanen 1998 ; beloborodov 1999b ) , which is observationally well constrained . note that some other definitions of @xmath40 also exist , modifying the above expression for the cases of large @xmath1 and relativistic @xmath0 . in particular , beloborodov ( 1999b ) used the definition of @xmath42(\\tau+\\tau^2)$ ] , for which case he found @xmath43 in a spherical geometry .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 ( or , equivalently , @xmath41 ) is often almost constant with varying flux for luminous black - hole sources ( e.g. , cyg x-1 , gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ; gx 339 - 4 , zdziarski et al .  1998 , 2004 ;",
    "wardziski et al .  2002 ;",
    "ic 4329a , fiore et al .",
    "1992 ) , which tells us that the relative cooling rate is typically more stable than the x - ray flux from the source .",
    "then , instead of considering the various sources of soft photons , we replace the electron energy equation by assuming that there is a local source of seed photons leading to a given parameter @xmath40 , and solve for the disc equations .",
    "this is in fact the approach adopted by sle ( who assumed @xmath44 ) , and by zdziarski ( 1998 ) , who generalized the hot disc model of sle by including energy advection in the ions energy equation and allowing @xmath40 to be a free parameter .",
    "we present the data we use in section [ compton ] . in section [ equations ] , we solve the radiation - hydrodynamic accretion equation parameterized by compton parameter , @xmath40 . for completeness",
    ", we also investigate the standard case , where only comptonization of synchrotron and bremsstrahlung photons is taken into account .",
    "the results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we then discuss our results in section [ discussion ] and present our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "table [ plasma ] summarizes best - fit plasma parameters of thermal comptonization models fitted to seyferts and two black - hole binaries in the hard state .",
    "this model has been found to fit the observed spectra rather well .",
    "we see that the fitted parameters cover a remarkably narrow range of the electron temperature , @xmath45100 kev .",
    "a similarly narrow range is obtained for the thomson optical depth ; the corresponding range for spherical geometry is @xmath461.5 . for clarity ,",
    "the uncertainties are not given in table [ plasma ] ; however , the best - fit values from a rather large number of fits all fall within the above range , which confirms the statistical significance of this result .",
    "the points for spherical geometry ( and including results of fits of hybrid plasma ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ t_tau ] .",
    "those points were mostly obtained with the highly accurate comptonization model of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) .    in the case of seyferts ,",
    "the data existing so far are mostly insufficient to constrain the parameters of the comptonizing plasma , with the exception of the seyfert brightest at @xmath47 kev , ngc 4151 . to circumvent this problem , average spectra from some sets of observations",
    "were formed ( nandra & pounds 1994 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 ; gondek et al .",
    "1996 ; zdziarski , poutanen , & johnson 2000 , hereafter zpj ) . among them , only zpj fit the resulting average spectra with thermal comptonization , and thus we use their results here .",
    "we note that zpj used as free parameters @xmath48 and @xmath40 instead of @xmath1 . to be able to show the results in our fig .",
    "[ t_tau ] , we have refitted the average spectrum of seyfert 1s in the @xmath48-@xmath1 space with the same assumptions as in zpj .",
    "their data are from the osse detector aboard _",
    "compton gamma ray observatory _ , which covers the energy range of above 50 kev only .",
    "data below 50 kev provide then additional constraints .",
    "however , the data sets of zpj were found to be compatible with the range of the x - ray photon spectral index of @xmath492.3 , which corresponds quite well to the range observed in seyferts ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ; zdziarski et al .  1999 , 2003 ) . in the contour shown in fig .",
    "[ t_tau ] , the end with the lowest @xmath1 and the highest @xmath48 corresponds to the softest spectra , with @xmath502.3 , whereas the opposite end corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the extent of this error contour actually corresponds to the range of the observed @xmath41 .",
    "it is also remarkable that this error contour agrees relatively well with the best - fit parameters of a number of individual accreting black holes ( for the same geometry ) .",
    ".hot plasma parameters in accreting black holes . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ standard ]    we also present our results in fig .  [ t_tau ] . comparing with the contour which corresponds to the average seyfert-1 spectrum ( zpj )",
    ", we find that the lhaf is much more favoured than the adaf as the accretion disc model describing the x - ray emission of seyferts .      in section [ seyfert ]",
    ", we have applied our model to agns . here , we extend our calculations to the case of stellar - mass black holes , assuming @xmath51 .",
    "we find that the results of our models are virtually independent of the mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the data for black - hole binaries are usually much better than those for seyferts .",
    "for example , the values of @xmath0 are determined rather accurately for some hard states of cyg x-1 and gx 3394 , with @xmath5260 kev ( frontera et al .",
    "2001 ; zdziarski et al .  1998 ; wardziski et al .",
    "such low values of @xmath0 can hardly be reached in the adaf case , while they are within the range of @xmath0 predicted by the lhaf model ( table [ y ] ) .",
    "( a specific application of the lhaf model to an x - ray binary , xte j1118 + 480 , has recently been given by yuan , cui & narayan 2004 . )    in addition to the value of @xmath0 , another very strong argument in favour of the lhaf is the very large bolometric luminosity of transient ( with a low - mass companion ) black - hole binaries in the hard state . during the rising phase of an outburst ,",
    "luminosities as high as @xmath53 are observed ( e.g. , in xte j1550564 , done & gierliski 2003 ; gx 3394 , zdziarski et al .",
    "2004 , see also nowak 1995 ; maccarone 2003 ) .",
    "such luminosities can not be achieved in the adaf model , but they can ( within a factor of two ) be obtained by the lhaf model ( see table [ y ] ) .",
    "narayan ( 1996 ) proposed that the variety of spectral states of black - hole x - ray binaries can be understood as a sequence of thin disc plus adaf models with varying @xmath14 and the transition radius .",
    "this idea was developed by esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ) and esin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in their work ,",
    "the hard state is associated with adafs with @xmath54 .",
    "the advection factor @xmath55 , which is a function of radius , is instead set to a value averaged over the whole accretion flow .",
    "then @xmath55 is found to have a low but still positive value , @xmath56 , at @xmath57 .",
    "the model typically predicts @xmath58k for accretion flows within @xmath59 , and @xmath60k for @xmath61 where most of the radiation comes from ( see fig .",
    "3b in esin et al .",
    "this is in good agreement with our results , in which we also find that an adaf predicts @xmath62k .",
    "while such an adaf model can explain the spectra of the hard state of some x - ray binaries very well , it is challenging to fit other spectra with lower energy cutoff such as cyg x-1 and gx 3394 because a lower @xmath63k is required there .",
    "a caveat for our results concerns the use of the one - zone approximation of comptonization in comparisons with prediction for @xmath0 and @xmath1 of accretion flow models .",
    "we use it because most of the available comptonization fits to data in astrophysical literature use the one - zone approach ( i.e. , a uniform electron temperature in a simple geometry ) .",
    "thus , in order to compare our results with the data , we neglect the radial dependences of the temperature and density and assume that most of the radiation comes from a single radius . we intend to extend our calculation in the future by including the profiles of the electron temperature and density in the accretion flow and the non - local nature of comptonization . on the other hand ,",
    "the above approximation is not used in comparisons of the predicted and observed luminosities of black - hole binaries .    in our calculations , we assume that the accretion rate is independent of radius . over the past few years , hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ; igumenshchev et al .",
    "2003 ) and analytical work ( narayan & yi 1994 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; narayan et al .",
    "2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) indicate that only a fraction of the gas that is available at large radius in the accretion flow may actually accrete onto the black hole .",
    "the rest of the gas is either ejected from the flow or is prevented from accreting by convective motions .",
    "the former is due to the positive sign of the bernoulli parameter of the accretion flow while the latter is due to the the accretion flow being convection - unstable .",
    "however , all the above results are for very low accretion rates .",
    "when the accretion rate is high , @xmath64 , as in our case , the bernoulli parameter is negative in general , and the flow is likely to be convection - stable since the entropy of an lhaf decreases rather than increases towards the smaller radii ( paper i ) .",
    "therefore , the constant accretion rate is likely a correct assumption in our case .",
    "we also assume that the viscous dissipation mainly heat ions .",
    "depending on some unknown details of microphysics , it is possible that a large fraction of the viscous dissipation also heat electrons ( quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) . if this is the case , one effect would be that the value of @xmath65 predicted in both adaf and lhaf will be somewhat larger for a fixed @xmath14",
    "this will make the adaf even worse for describing the x - ray emission of seyfert-1 galaxies and the hard state of x - ray binaries .",
    "another effect of electron heating would be that the value of the critical accretion rate of adaf , @xmath18 , becomes smaller due to the weaker viscous dissipation heating of ions . in this case ,",
    "the lowest @xmath0 an adaf can produce will become higher , which again makes the adaf worse as the model of seyfert-1 galaxies and x - ray binaries in the hard state and implies the occurrence of lhafs .",
    "there are two possible origins for the hot accretion flows .",
    "one is through the transition from an outer standard thin disc .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested for the transition from the outer cold disc to the inner hot disc .",
    "one is the evaporation of the cold disc due to thermal conduction ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; meyer , liu , & meyer - hofmeister 2000 ; raska & czerny 2000 ) . the second is turbulent diffusive heat transport ( honma 1996 ; manmoto et al .",
    "2000 ; manmoto & kato 2000 ) .",
    "the third one is the secular instability present in the radiation pressure - dominated inner region of the standard thin disc ( lightman & eardley 1974 ; gammie 1998 ) .",
    "if the accretion flow is one - phase , then the accretion mode within @xmath66 is simply determined by the accretion rate , @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath67 , it is an adaf , otherwise it is an lhaf .",
    "if the transition is due to secular instability , the instability may result in the formation of cold clumps embedded in the hot flow . in this case",
    ", the accretion rate and accretion mode in the hot phase may depend on the interchange of matter and energy between the cold and hot phases .",
    "the emission from the cold clumps will supply additional soft photons as the seeds for comptonization .",
    "the second possible origin for hot accretion flow is that the accretion flow is already hot at large radii ( e.g. , shlosman , begelman & frank 1990 ) .",
    "first , there exists such a hot branch of accretion solution even for the accretion rates as high as eddington ( paper i ) .",
    "second , in the case of agns , there is strong observational evidence that hot cooling flows carry large amount of hot gas into the central region of agns ( sarazin 1986 ; arnaud 1988 ) which could serve as the accretion material .",
    "the hot ism is also a source of accreting material . in the case of x - ray binaries ,",
    "if the accretion comes from the supersonic stellar wind from the companion star , the accretion flow may start out hot due to the heating of a bow shock .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the hot accretion disc model applied to the x - ray emission of seyfert galaxies and black - hole binaries in the hard state .",
    "especially , we consider the luminous hot accretion flow recently found ( paper i)lhaf  and compare it with the adaf .",
    "we numerically solve the radiation hydrodynamical accretion equation to obtain the electron temperature and the thomson optical depth of these two models at the radius where most of the emission comes from .",
    "we adopt two forms of the electron energy equation , with one being the standard in the sense that only synchrotron , bremsstrahlung and their comptonization are included as the emission mechanisms , with the other parameterized by the compton parameter , @xmath40 , to approximate the actual cooling process of electrons , e.g. , external soft seed photon and feedback process between cold and hot components .    comparing our results to those obtained by fitting the observed average spectra of seyfert-1 galaxies and black - hole binaries by thermal comptonization models , we find :",
    "( i ) the adaf with the standard electron energy equation is ruled out due to its @xmath0 being too high ; ( ii ) the adaf with external soft photon as seed photon of comptonization is also not likely to be responsible for the x - rays ; ( iii ) the lhaf with standard electron energy equation is marginally feasible in the sense that @xmath0 is in the edge of the observed parameter space ; ( iv ) the most possible accretion disc model for the x - ray emission of seyfert-1 galaxies is an lhaf with the electron energy equation including additional sources of seed photons ( parametrized by @xmath40 ) ; ( v ) the high bolometric luminosity of some black hole x - ray binaries in the hard states can be achieved in an lhaf but not an adaf .",
