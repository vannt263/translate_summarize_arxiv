    ", they predicted that very approximately 60% of the ebl at 850  @xmath0 m should be resolved into discrete sources between 0.5 and 2.0  mjy .",
    "blank field scuba surveys can not reach the required sensitivities to directly detect the dominant population of @xmath14  mjy extragalactic sources due to confusion noise resulting from the coarse resolution of scuba ( e.g. , hogg 2001 ) .",
    "thus , in order to search for this population with scuba , one must observe fields with massive cluster lenses to take advantage of both gravitational amplification by the lens and reduced confusion noise .",

    "( 1998 ) pioneered this method , making the first scuba observations of cluster lenses .",
    "they studied seven clusters with well - constrained lens models where it is possible to correct the observed source fluxes for lens amplification .",
    "their survey was designed to detect the brightest submillimeter sources in relatively short integration times , and hence it is quite shallow with @xmath15 flux limits around 6  mjy .    despite the shallowness of the survey , blain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) tried to determine the number counts at and below 1  mjy , arguing that the small regions of high amplification ( around a factor of 6 at 1  mjy and a factor of 24 at 0.25  mjy ) could be used to probe these faint fluxes .",
    "( a later analysis of another cluster sample of similar depth by chapman et al .  ( 2002 ) did not extend the counts below 1  mjy . ) however , direct inversion at these amplification levels is complicated because redshift uncertainties and small positional changes can have large effects on the amplification . in scuba surveys",
    "the positions of the submillimeter sources are relatively poorly determined and the redshifts are often unknown . while these effects have comparatively little effect on the shape of the determined counts , they do effectively limit the flux level to which the counts can be considered to be determined .",
    "we shall discuss this point further in   4 .",
    "the sub - mjy counts are best addressed by obtaining much deeper images , since at lower amplifications there is considerably less redshift and positional sensitivity . at typical amplifications of 1 to 4 ,",
    "the counts can be robustly investigated down to a few tenths of a mjy from images with @xmath15 limits of 1.5 to 2  mjy .",
    "because of this key point , and because the observed areas at the sub - mjy fluxes of interest rise rapidly with deeper obervations , it is a natural and important progression to pursue the faint submillimeter counts with much longer integrations on lensing cluster fields .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "scuba jiggle map observations were taken in mostly excellent observing conditions during runs in 1999 august , september , and november ; 2000 november and december ; and 2001 january , march , and june .",
    "the maps were dithered to prevent any regions of the sky from repeatedly falling on bad bolometers .",
    "the chop throw was fixed at a position angle of 90  deg so that the negative beams would appear @xmath16 on either side east - west of the positive beam .",
    "regular `` skydips '' ( lightfoot et al .  1998 ) were obtained to measure the zenith atmospheric opacities at 450 and 850  @xmath0 m , and the 225  ghz sky opacity was monitored at all times to check for sky stability .",
    "pointing checks were performed every hour during the observations on the blazars 0106 + 013 , 0215 + 015 , 0221 + 067 , 0336 - 019 , 0420 - 014 , 0917 + 449 , 0923 + 392 , 2145 + 067 , or 2251 + 158 .",
    "the data were reduced using the dedicated scuba user reduction facility ( surf , jenness & lightfoot 1998 ) . due to the variation in the density of bolometer samples across the maps , there is a rapid increase in the noise levels at the very edges , so the low exposure edges were clipped .",
    "the data were calibrated using jiggle maps of the primary calibration source mars or the secondary calibration sources crl618 , crl2688 , or oh231.8 + 4.2 .",
    "the routines produce a noise - weighted exposure time at each pixel , which we shall denote as @xmath17 .",
    "submillimeter fluxes were measured using beam - weighted routines that include both the positive and negative portions of the beam profile to provide the optimal extraction .",
    "the surf reduction routines arbitrarily normalize all the data maps in a reduction sequence to the central pixel of the first map ; thus , the noise levels in a combined image are determined relative to the quality of the central pixel in the first map . in order to determine the absolute noise levels of our maps , we first eliminated the @xmath18 real sources in each field by subtracting an appropriately normalized version of the beam profile .",
    "we then iteratively adjusted the noise normalization until the dispersion of the signal - to - noise ratio measured at random positions became @xmath19 .",
    "this noise estimate includes both fainter sources and correlated noise ; hereafter we refer to it as `` uncleaned noise '' .",
    "we also constructed `` true noise '' maps in which all the sources have been cleaned out so that the maps contain only sky and bolometer noise . to do this , we divided the data for each cluster into two halves and then combined the jiggle maps for each of the two halves separately , keeping only the first jiggle map in the reduction sequence the same in both halves , since the data maps are normalized to the central pixel of the first map .",
    "we then subtracted the two halves from one another .",
    "since the faint sources are at fixed positions in the maps , the subtraction effectively removes them from the maps , resulting in true noise maps for each cluster field .",
    "the true noise maps were then scaled to the actual maps by multiplying each pixel by the factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the weighted exposure times in the two half images .",
    "the three cluster field centers , total scuba exposure times ( based on the number of integrations ) , median optical depths , areas , and 850  @xmath0 m sensitivities ( @xmath23 ) for the true noise maps and the uncleaned noise maps are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "in contrast to the situation in the optical and near infrared , we do not expect there to be much contamination of the background submillimeter number counts by cluster members , which lie at too low redshifts to be strong submillimeter sources",

    "we confirm the detection of the cd galaxy in a2390 and also find a source associated with the southern d galaxy in a370 .",

    "the observed sources directly determine the fraction of the ebl which has been resolved , since the average sky brightness is conserved by the lensing process .",
    "this is by far the most robust quantity which can be derived from the observations ( chapman et al .",
    "the average ebl contribution of the three fields is 17.3  jy  deg@xmath2 , and the breakdown by field is 22.7  jy  deg@xmath2 ( a370 ) , 17.4  jy  deg@xmath2 ( a851 ) , and 11.8  jy  deg@xmath2 ( a2390 ) , with the differences reflecting the different depths of the images and the statistical uncertainties from the small numbers of sources involved .",
    "the average over the three fields is between 40% and 56% of the total ebl , depending on whether we adopt the ebl value of 44  jy  deg@xmath2 ( fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ) or 31  jy  deg@xmath2 ( puget et al .  1996 ) .",
    "however , detailed models are required to determine the flux ranges which give rise to this contribution .",
    "the contribution to the ebl from sources greater than 6  mjy ( roughly previous survey limits ) is 7.8  jy  deg@xmath2 ; thus , the increased sensitivity roughly doubles the resolved fraction of the ebl in these clusters .",
    "for a blank field observation , the number counts are determined by dividing the number of significantly detected sources in a sample by the area over which the sources could be detected at that level . in the case of a lensed field ,",
    "the sensitivity to a background source is dependent on the position and redshift of the background source and on the redshift of the gravitational lens .",
    "these lensing effects can be corrected for with a sufficiently detailed mass model for the lens .",
    "we used the lenstool models to determine the flux amplifications .",
    "lenstool uses multiple - component mass distributions that describe the extended potential well of the clusters and their more massive individual member galaxies ( e.g. , kneib et al .",
    "the mass distributions are derived from the positions of multiply - imaged features identified in high - resolution optical images ; spectroscopic redshifts constrain the models .",
    "details of the models for the a370 , a851 , and a2390 clusters can be found in kneib et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , seitz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and kneib et al .",
    ", in preparation , respectively .",
    "using lenstool we mapped the background galaxies from their observed positions back onto the source plane using known redshifts , where available , or to an assumed source redshift of @xmath36 .",
    "we give the resulting amplifications in column  6 of table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "although the amplification of a source depends on both the redshift of the lens and the redshift of the source , at the redshifts of our three cluster lenses ( @xmath37 for a370 , @xmath38 for a851 , and @xmath39 for a2390 ) , the amplification varies only weakly with redshift for any source beyond @xmath40 _ which has a modest amplification_. blain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated that as long as the source redshifts are greater than one , the systematic uncertainties ( due to the uncertainties in both the redshift distribution of the detected sources and the mass models of the clusters ) are less than 25% and hence are comparable to the typical uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration of the scuba maps .    however , sources with high amplifications have much larger uncertainties associated with positional uncertainty and redshift indeterminancy than sources with relatively low amplifications . for the high amplification sources lying near critical lines , small changes in position or redshift can result in very large variations in amplification . in order to quantify this effect , we computed the maximum and minimum amplifications in a @xmath24 radius region surrounding each source . for the sources where we do not have a refined position from an optical identification , we give this range in brackets after the amplification in table  3 . for sources with `` typical '' amplifications of 1 to 4",
    "the effect is generally small .",
    "however , the high amplification sources can easily have order of magnitude amplification uncertainties associated with their positions ( and also with their redshifts ) , and this must be allowed for in any analysis .",
    "five of the sources in our sample ( two in a370 and three in a2390 ) fall into this category .",
    "all lie at the faint end of the sample where we can not easily use secondary constraints , such as the lack of multiple images , to provide limits on the amplifications . for two of the sources in a2390 ( 13 and 14 in table",
    "3 ) there are no sensible upper limits to the amplifications , so we give only lower bounds . in what follows we use the maximum and minimum amplifications given in table  3 to determine how much the number counts can be changed by the amplification uncertainties .    for the direct number counts ,",
    "we need to know the source plane areas for which background galaxies would fall within the scuba maps and be significantly detected .",
    "( due to the expansion of the source plane , the source plane areas are smaller than the areas of the scuba maps . )",
    "to do this , we created a grid of @xmath36 background sources at one arcsecond separations and used lenstool to produce the corresponding image plane maps with magnifications @xmath41 .",
    "( for sources with known redshifts , we created the source plane grids at the known redshifts . ) each grid point on the image plane corresponds to an area on the source plane of 1  arcsec@xmath42 .",
    "if the sensitivities of the scuba maps were uniform , we could determine the source plane area for a @xmath15 detection at a given submillimeter flux by finding the number of points at each image plane grid point that satisfied the equation @xmath43 m ) and then multiplying that number by 1  arcsec@xmath42 .",
    "however , since the scuba maps become less sensitive towards the edges where the exposure times are less , the equation to be satisfied is instead @xmath44 m ) , where @xmath45 is the minimum noise in the field and @xmath46 is the maximum weighted exposure time .",
    "the number of points satisfying this equation can then be multiplied by 1  arcsec@xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the areas over which a source with a given flux in the source plane would be detected at the @xmath15 level in the image plane for each of the three cluster fields .",
    "the high magnification of the a370 cluster lens means there is less source plane area at high submillimeter fluxes in the a370 field but much more source plane area at low submillimeter fluxes .",
    "the scuba data available on a370 are deeper than the data on the other two clusters , which also contributes to the sizeable differences in source plane areas seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] at the fainter fluxes .",
    "we can now determine our raw cumulative source counts by summing the inverse areas of all the sources in the three fields brighter than flux @xmath7 .",
    "we present these raw cumulative 850  @xmath0 m counts per square degree ( solid squares ) in fig .",
    "we also show as the open symbols the counts computed using the minimum ( triangles ) and maximum ( diamonds ) amplifications of table  3 .",
    "the shape and the normalization of the counts are quite insensitive to the choice of minimum or maximum amplifications ( see also chapman et al .",
    "however , the flux to which the counts can be considered to be determined does depend critically on the amplification .    in the present data ,",
    "if we adopt the minimum amplifications , then the counts only extend down to 0.1  mjy .",
    "however , if we were instead to assume that the average or maximum amplifications were appropriate , then the counts would extend to much fainter fluxes ( @xmath47  mjy ) . because the areas of high amplification are small",
    ", this would then imply that the counts turn up quite steeply below 0.1  mjy in order for us to actually be able to detect sources in such small areas .",
    "indeed , in the maximum amplification case , two of the sources even lie below the 0.01  mjy flux limit of fig .",
    "however , since we have a perfectly adequate solution with the minimum amplifications , at present we have no way of knowing whether there really are sources at fluxes below 0.1  mjy . to avoid this uncertainty , for the remaining discussion of the counts",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to fluxes above 0.1  mjy .",
    "we have overplotted on the figure a power - law fit ( solid line ) to the solid squares based on an area - weighted maximum likelihood fit ( crawford , jauncey , & murdoch 1970 ) , which gives a slope of @xmath48 and provides a good representation of the raw counts .",
    "given the complex effects of noise and confusion , the errors and systematic biases of the counts are best estimated with monte carlo simulations .",
    "we created simulated images by drawing sources from a population with a count described by the power - law fit and placing them randomly on the source plane .",
    "we limited the fluxes of the input sources to be brighter than 0.01  mjy .",
    "we then mapped and amplified the sources to the image plane using lenstool and added the sources into the true noise maps .",
    "we analyzed the resulting images with the same procedures that we used to analyze the real data .",
    "we ran 100 realizations for each field and derived the average output counts .",
    "we then iteratively adjusted the input count model until the average output counts matched the observed counts . for the final determination of the counts completeness and",
    "confidence ranges we used the input power - law    @xmath49    shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the recovered counts obtained for this input count model .",
    "the recovered counts can be compared with the observed raw counts , which are shown by the solid squares in fig .",
    "the recovered counts exhibit a small systematic upward ( eddington ) bias relative to the input counts at the brighter fluxes . over the 1 to 5  mjy range we see an increase by a factor of 1.25 .",

    ".  found boost factors of 1.28 and 1.35 at 5  mjy for their two areas .",
    "the shallower slope of the counts in the present simulation may account for the slightly smaller correction . at low fluxes",
    "the recovered counts drop below the input counts as the source detection becomes incomplete .",
    "the uncertainty corridors for the counts may also be obtained by looking at the spread of counts over the various realizations . the 90% confidence range measured in this way from the simulations",
    "is shown by the thin solid lines and should provide a good estimate of the uncertainties on the observed counts .    as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the counts are best determined in the 0.3 to 5  mjy flux range . here",
    "the areas are large enough to provide a significant sample . however , the statistical uncertainties are still large with only 7 sources lying in this range . at 1  mjy",
    "we find a cumulative count of @xmath50  deg@xmath2 , after correcting for the systematic upward bias , where the upper and lower bounds are the 90% confidence range .",
    "this is consistent with the blain et al .",

    "mjy the cumulative counts have risen to @xmath1  deg@xmath2 , where the upper and lower bounds are again the 90% confidence range .",
    "the noise distributions of the uncleaned noise maps ( i.e. , the maps with the directly detected sources removed ) contain additional independent information over the direct counts . in principle",
    ", the noise distributions should provide a more sensitive diagnostic of the counts at sub - mjy fluxes than the direct counts because the useable areas are much larger than the areas over which @xmath15 sources can be detected .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the distribution functions ( combined for all three cluster fields ) from both the true noise and the uncleaned noise maps .",
    "the true noise distribution function is well fit by a smooth gaussian function , which is shown in the figure in place of the actual distribution function .",
    "the uncleaned noise distribution function ( jagged curve ) has extensions to the right and left of the true noise distribution function .",
    "the different shapes of these two extensions result from there being twice as many negative positions as positive positions in the beam pattern corresponding to each source , but at half the flux ( because of the nod and fixed chop observing procedure used ) . for the present data a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( applied to the absolute values of the distribution to combine the two tails of the distribution function ) does not reject the hypothesis that the uncleaned noise distribution is drawn from the true noise distribution because there are a relatively small number ( approximately 240 ) of independent points in the fields .",
    "a noise analysis is therefore primarily useful in placing an upper bound on the counts .",
    "the difference between the observed uncleaned and the simulated uncleaned distribution functions can be used to constrain the simulated counts distribution .",
