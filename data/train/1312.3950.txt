    "supermassive black hole growth and galaxy growth have long been thought to be correlated , as supported by the magorrian and m@xmath3 relations @xcite .",
    "both active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity and star formation peak at @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the processes appear to be correlated in both agn host and normal galaxy samples ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the connection between star formation activity and black hole mass accretion in galaxies is not well - understood .",
    "several studies suggest that agn activity is needed to explain the cutoff at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function and the halting of star formation in the most massive galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this theory is supported by the observation that agn activity lags star formation by @xmath5 years @xcite , and that many agns lie in the ` green valley ' ( e.g. , @xcite) the sparsely populated region between the red sequence and the blue cloud @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find that out to @xmath6 agns are preferentially hosted by star - forming , rather than quiescent or quenching galaxies .",
    "additionally , dust attenuation may redden the color of many agn host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) , implying that star formation quenching by agns may not control the transition between blue and red galaxies . instead",
    ", the connection between agn and star formation activity may simply reflect the fact that both processes require a large gas supply , with possible delays between star formation and agn activity caused by inefficient black hole fueling .",
    "for example , simulations by , suggest that star formation peaks as a function of gas density , while torques regulating further inflow are relatively inefficient and limit black hole growth , leaving a reservoir of gas long after the gas supply for star formation is exhausted .    while it is difficult to disentangle the contributions of star formation and agn activity of high redshift galaxies from optical observations alone , x - ray imaging acts as a better tracer of agn activity , with unobscured agns emitting heavily in both hard and soft bands , and obscured agn dominated by hard x - ray emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "galactic x - ray emission also traces stellar activity , through low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , whose primarily soft x - ray emission correlates with stellar mass , as well as high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) and supernova , whose harder emission is reflective of star formation .",
    "soft x - ray emission from hot gas is also apparent in the halos of massive ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "= 3.0 in = 3.0 in    = 3.0 in = 4.2 in    the x - ray galaxy connection has been systematically studied at low redshift , providing a rough census of x - ray luminosity with stellar mass , galaxy type , and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite find that the agn fraction for massive early type galaxies increases with redshift , while the x - ray emission in less massive galaxies evolves very little out to @xmath7 .",
    "late - type galaxies evolve significantly in x - ray luminosity with redshift , and furthermore their x - ray emission shows a strong dependence on stellar mass @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "x - ray galaxy studies have primarily focused on direct x - ray detections ( e.g. , @xcite ) or on specific galaxy populations , such as lyman break galaxies ( lbgs , steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) , submillimeter bright galaxies ( smgs ) , and distant red galaxies ( drgs , franx et al .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the x - ray emission is dominated by an agn in only 15% of the smgs out to @xmath8 in the chandra deep field north ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , while for lbgs and drgs the x - ray emission seems almost completely accounted for by star formation ( e.g. , reddy & steidel 2004 ; rubin et al .",
    "however , these different selection techniques target galaxies at different redshifts and stellar masses , and even combined are not representative of the full distant galaxy population .",
    "hence , a complete census of the x - ray properties of distant galaxies is still missing .    using the high - quality near - infrared photometry from the newfirm medium band survey ( nmbs,@xcite ) in combination with chandra data ,",

    "after normalizing by galaxy mass and correcting for the redshift correlation , x - ray luminosity decreases with an increase in stellar population ages ( as measured by @xmath10 ) .",
    "we utilize local xrb luminosity functions to determine the stellar contribution to the galaxy x - ray luminosities .",
    "we find that there is a significant luminosity excess for most galaxies , particularly those with high values of @xmath10 , suggesting large x - ray contributions from hot gas and/or black hole accretion .",
    "consistent with other studies , we find that low luminosity agns show at best a mild preference for galaxies with shallower @xmath114  breaks and higher ssfrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "first , there is a large scatter in x - ray luminosity from non - stellar sources for similar galaxy types .",
    "second , there is no strong correlation between the x - ray emission from non - stellar sources and spectral type .",
    "however , we observe that obscuration ( as determined by hardness ratio ) appears to increase with increasing redshift as the photon index decreases .",
    "this is consistent with the slight increase in x - ray luminosity per unit stellar mass with redshift , suggesting an increase in agn accretion rates in these galaxies .",
    "we note that we do not probe the highest black hole accretion rates , as our selection methods bias against galaxies for which the continuum emission is not dominated by stellar light .",
    "while it is difficult to differentiate sources of x - ray emission from c - cosmos data alone , a similar analysis of cosmos radio data ( such as that undertaken by @xcite of lyman break galaxies in the field ) , mid - infrared data , and 6 - 79kev x - ray data from nustar could provide more direct information about the obscured agn activity in these galaxies , helping to differentiate them from heavily star - forming galaxies that are x - ray hard .",
    "in addition , nir spectra of @xmath115 galaxies can aid in more accurate measurements of agn demographics using emission line ratios [ nii]/h@xmath63 and [ oiii]/h@xmath64 .",
    "an analogous analysis using the deeper chandra deep field south data could also be performed , helping to constrain the amount of variability within individual galaxy sed types .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the nmbs and the chandra cosmos teams for their observations and creation of the catalogs .",
    "we would like to thank ryan hickox and jane rigby for useful discussions .",

    "<S> we examine how the total x - ray luminosity correlates with stellar mass , stellar population , and redshift for a @xmath0-band limited sample of @xmath1 galaxies at @xmath2 from the newfirm medium band survey in the cosmos field . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy sample is divided into 32 different galaxy types , based on similarities between the spectral energy distributions . for each galaxy type </S>",
    "<S> , we further divide the sample into bins of redshift and stellar mass , and perform an x - ray stacking analysis using the chandra cosmos ( c - cosmos ) data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that full band x - ray luminosity is primarily increasing with stellar mass , and at similar mass and spectral type is higher at larger redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> when comparing at the same stellar mass , we find that the x - ray luminosity is slightly higher for younger galaxies ( i.e. , weaker 4000  breaks ) , but the scatter in this relation is large . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observed x - ray luminosities to those expected from low and high mass x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) . for blue galaxies , xrbs </S>",
    "<S> can almost fully account for the observed emission , while for older galaxies with larger 4000   breaks , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or hot gas dominate the measured x - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> after correcting for xrbs , the x - ray luminosity is still slightly higher in younger galaxies , although this correlation is not significant . </S>",
    "<S> agn appear to be a larger component of galaxy x - ray luminosity at earlier times , as the hardness ratio increases with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> together with the slight increase in x - ray luminosity this may indicate more obscured agns or higher accretion rates at earlier times . </S>"
