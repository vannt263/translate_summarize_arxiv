    "during the last years , a new interest on m dwarfs has emerged .",
    "one reason is because their low masses make them ideal targets around which to search for terrestrial planets in the habitable zone ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , these stars can be very active and their activity signatures can hinder the detection of orbiting planets ( e.g. ) .",
    "furthermore , the levels of uv radiation , which are strongly related to stellar activity , can also limit the habitability @xcite .",
    "the usually accepted model to describe the generation and intensification of magnetic fields in late f- to early m - type stars is the @xmath1-dynamo first invoked to explain solar activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is this model , where the large - scale magnetic field generation results from the interaction of differential rotation in the tachocline and the convective turbulence , which predicts a strong correlation between activity and rotation .",
    "magnetic activity therefore decays with time as the star spins down due to braking by magnetized winds .",
    "however , recent results show that this decay happens in the first two gyr of a star s life , to be compared with lifetimes of late - type stars which are at least 2 times larger .    since stars with spectral type later than m3 are believed to be fully convective",
    ", they should not be able to sustain a solar - like @xmath1 dynamo .",
    "furthermore , most dm stars are usually slow rotators . in a recent survey of 123 m - dwarfs",
    ", @xcite found that only seven of them are rotating more rapidly than their detection threshold of @xmath2 .",
    "however , there is plenty of observational evidence that late - type slow rotators like dme stars are very active and have strong magnetic fields @xcite , with filling factors larger than for earlier stars .",
    "in fact , there is evidence that stellar spin - down and active lifetimes change near the mass where full convection sets in .",
    "proposed that for fully convective dm stars , large - scale magnetic fields could be produced by a pure @xmath3 dynamo , where activity would not decay with time since it does not involve rotation .",
    "@xcite developed a 3-d dynamo model for m dwarfs , and found that fully convective stars can generate kg - strength magnetic fields without the aid of a shearing tachocline .",
    "to date , activity cycles have been detected in several late - type stars ( e.g. ) .",
    "however , these works are mainly concentrated on f to k stars , since due to the long exposure times needed to observe them , the red and faint m dwarfs are usually not the target of long - term observational studies of stellar activity . as a contribution to this subject",

    "we analyze the role of h@xmath5 as an activity indicator in these stars .",
    "since 1999 , we systematically observed more than 140 main - sequence stars from f5.5 to m5.5 , with the echelle spectrograph on the 2.15 m telescope of the casleo observatory located in the argentinean andes . to date",
    ", we have more than 4000 spectra , ranging from 3890 to 6690  with r = @xmath626400 , which constitute an ideal dataset to study long - term activity .",
    "these spectra are calibrated in flux according to the method outlined in , and allow us to simultaneously study different spectral features , from the ca lines to h@xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the usual indicator of chromospheric activity in df to dk stars is the well known mount wilson @xmath7 index , essentially the ratio of the flux in the core of the ca h and k lines to the continuum nearby @xcite . @xcite",
    "defined a ca index from the casleo spectra , which was calibrated to the mount wilson index .",
    "since casleo spectra are calibrated in flux , they also derived a conversion factor which translates known @xmath7 index to flux in the ca cores .",
    "however , due to the low intrinsic luminosity of m dwarfs , the low signal - to - noise in the ca h line in several casleo spectra and the fact that this line can be contaminated by the h@xmath8 line , the @xmath7 index is not suitable to study the chromospheric activity on the faint stars in this study . in this paper",
    "we use as a proxy of stellar activity the ca k line - core flux , integrated with a triangular profile of 1.09  fwhm to mimic the response of the mount wilson instrument .",
    "we complement our data with photometry from the all sky automated survey ( asas ) .",
    "this project is dedicated to constant photometric monitoring of the whole available sky , including approximately 10@xmath9 stars brighter than 14 magnitude @xcite .",
    "presently , asas consists of two observing stations , one in las campanas observatory , chile ( since 1997 ) and the other on haleakala , maui ( since 2006 ) .",
    "each site is equipped with two wide - field 200/2.8 instruments , observing simultaneously in the v and i bands . in this work",
    "we used the mean v magnitude of each observing season to analyze the long - term activity of the stars .",
    "gl 229 a is a moderately active dm1 flare star @xcite , with a brown dwarf companion @xcite .",

    "we discarded all the observations that were not qualified as either a or b in the asas database ( i.e. we retained only the best quality data ) , as well as 16 outlier observations .",
    "the final dataset consists of 469 points , with typical errors of around 30 mmag .",
    "the mean magnitude variation for the whole period is only @xmath00.17% around @xmath10 , while the short - scale variations in the v magnitude have a @xmath01% amplitude . to explore",
    "if these variations are governed by spots and active regions on the stellar surface , we analyzed if there is evidence of rotational modulation in the asas data , studying the dataset in each observing season with the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite .",
    "however , in agreement with @xcite , we did not find evidence of rotational modulation in the asas datasets .    to search for long - term chromospheric cycles , we analyzed both datasets with the lomb - scargle periodogram , and we computed the false alarm probability ( fap ) of the obtained periods with a monte carlo simulation , as is explained in . for the ca k fluxes plotted in fig .",

    "this extremely low fap is related to the large number of points of this series ( see eq . 22 in @xcite ) . to reduce the number of points , and to eliminate short - term variations , we binned the data grouping together the observations corresponding to the same observing season .",

    "@xcite studied long - term photometric and chromospheric emission variations in solar - type stars , and found that young , active stars become fainter as their chromospheric emission increases , whereas older , less active stars , including the sun , tend to become brighter as their chromospheric emission increases .",
    "since during active periods the surface of the star is covered by dark spots and bright faculae , a simple interpretation of this behavior is that long - term variability of young stars is spot - dominated , whereas for older stars it is faculae - dominated .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed the anti - correlation between brightness and chromospheric emission for active stars , and found that direct correlations are not prevalent for the less active solar - age stars .",
    "in particular for gl 229 a , the maximum ca k line - core emission nearly coincides with the minimum mean v magnitude , as in the sun . in fig .",
    "[ fig.hd42581_seriesp ] we invert the v - magnitude scale and we observe that if we shift the chromospheric activity indicators by approximately 500 days , there is a good correlation between both series with a pearson correlation coefficient r=0.59 .",

    "the physical explanation for these timelags remains unknown @xcite .",
    "gl 752 is a binary system composed by the by dra variable m2.5 star gl 752 a and a fainter companion gl 752 b ( also known as vb10 ) of spectral class m8v .",
    "@xcite reported that the astrometric variations detected in gl 752 b could be an evidence of the first giant planet around an ultra cool star .",
    "however , @xcite discarded the posibility of a planetary companion around this star by radial velocity techniques .",
    "the gl 752 system is particularly interesting to study the dynamo processes as it is composed by two coeval stars with different internal structures .",
    "the primary star has a radiative core , where a solar - type dynamo could operate , and the secondary component is a fully - convective star . with this aim",
    ", @xcite analyzed several uv lines from _ hst _ spectra of gl 752 a and b. they detected a flare - like event in the m8 component , which is an indirect evidence of a dynamo operating in this fully - convective star .",

    "[ fig.hd180617_asas_in_time ] we plot the v magnitude available at the asas catalog .",
    "we selected the data of best quality and discarded 7 outlier points , resulting in a total of 398 points . from these data , we obtain a mean magnitude @xmath21 between 2001 and 2010 , with a long - term variation of only 0.25% between minimum and maximum .",
    "however , short - time variations ( @xmath0month ) of the v magnitude are more evident , and are between 0.3 to 1.5 % .",
    "as done for gl 229 a , we analyzed if these variations were modulated by stellar rotation .",
    "in particular , from the projected rotational velocity published in @xcite , @xcite estimated a rotational period @xmath22 days for this star .",
    "however , we did not find any significant periodicity neither in the seasonal datasets nor in the whole asas series .    to search for long - term chromospheric cycles we analyzed the ca k fluxes with the lomb - scargle periodogram , and we detected a period @xmath23 days with a monte carlo fap=25% .",
    "this relatively large fap is due to the large variations that can be seen in the data in 2002 and 2005 . in both cases ,",
    "these variations , obtained between observations taken a few months apart , can not be caused by cyclic activity .",
    "if we smooth out these variations by averaging these points , we obtain a similar period with a more significant fap@xmath24 .    for the mean v magnitude per observing season the period found was @xmath25 days with a fap=22% .",
    "[ fig.hd180617_per ] both periodograms are plotted together . in the figure",
    ", it can be seen that both periods coincide within 2-@xmath26 errors .",

    ", we obtained eight series with @xmath17 between 2845 and 2990 days with faps@xmath28 , two series with @xmath17 between 3300 and 3495 days with faps@xmath29 and one with @xmath17=1398 days .",
    "we remark that in this last periodogram there is a secondary maximum near 2985 days with fap@xmath050% .",
    "this test shows that although we shorten the series by discarding their extremes the 7-year - period is still detected .    in contrst",
    "to gl 229 a , in fig .",
    "[ fig.hd180617_seriesp ] we observe that gl 752 a becomes fainter when the ca emission increases , implying that for this star spots dominate the emission .    on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ fig.hd180617_seriesp ] the ca k line series precedes the mean v magnitude dataset .",
    "the chromospheric activity increased between 2001.2 and 2005.6 , while the corresponding photospheric activity increment is between 2002.7 and 2006.5 , as expressed by the ca fluxes and the v magnitude respectively . if we shift the chromospheric series in 360 days , both datasets coincide within the normalization constant with a pearson correlation coefficient r=0.78 .",
    "another activity indicator usually employed in the study of dm stars is the flux in h@xmath5 . the flux in this line is generally considered to correlate well with the flux in the ca h and k lines and has the advantage of being located in a redder wavelength range than the ca lines , where m dwarfs are brighter .",
    "however , it has been reported by @xcite that the correlation between ca and h@xmath5 is not always valid .",
    "@xcite found that while some stars exhibit correlations between h@xmath5 and the ca lines , the slopes change from star to star .",
    "furthermore , in several cases both fluxes were not correlated , as in the binary system gl 375 , and other stars even exhibit anti - correlations .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the relation between simultaneous measurements of ca k and h@xmath5 fluxes in a sample of nearby m3 dwarfs , and found that the relationship between both tracers remains ambiguous for weak and intermediate activity stars .",
    "on the other hand , studied the contribution of plages and filaments in the h@xmath5-ca relation in the sun for different time scales , in an attempt to explain the results by @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we checked whether an h@xmath5-ca correlation exists for gl 229 a and gl 752 a. to do so , we computed the flux in the h@xmath5 line as the average surface flux in a 1.5  square passband centered in 6562.8  for all the spectra plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.hd42581_ha ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.hd180617_ha ] . * for both stars",
    "the h@xmath5 line is in absorption , which indicate that gl 229 a and gl 752 a are not strongly active , since most active m dwarfs have h@xmath5 in emission . * in fig .",
    "[ fig.hd180617_haca ] and [ fig.hd42581_haca ] we plot the line - core fluxes in h@xmath5 vs. those in the ca k line .",
    "it can be seen that , within the errors , none of these stars exhibit any sign of correlation between the lines fluxes , as expressed by the pearson correlation coefficients r=-0.09 for gl 229 a and r=-0.11 for gl 752 a. therefore , the h@xmath5 line can not be used as an activity indicator for these stars .",
    "in this work we studied the long - term activity of two m dwarf stars : gl 229 a and gl 752 a. to do so , we analyzed the ca k line - core fluxes measured on our spectra obtained at the casleo observatory since 2000 , and the asas photometric data . using the lomb - scargle periodogram",
    ", we obtained a possible activity cycle of @xmath04 and @xmath07 yrs for gl 229 a and gl 752 a , respectively .",
    "we note that , for both stars , similar periods are found in the photometry and in the ca fluxes , which constitute two completely independent datasets , a fact which strongly reinforces the significance of the results .",
    "as our program continues , we hope to confirm both periods in future work .",
    "another interesting result of this work is that the chromospheric activity seems to precede the photometric data in @xmath30 yr .",
    "this time - lag was also reported in the dme system gl 375 .",
    "although the physical explanation for this phenomenon remains unknown , one possible interpretation for the offset between the photometric and chromospheric variations is that the chromosphere gets heated before spots are formed .",
    "the time - lag detected in gl 229 a and gl 752 a s data - sets bring further evidences of this phenomenon in late - type stars .    on the other hand , since the chromospheric emission in gl 752 a is larger when the system is fainter , we conclude that the emission of this star should be dominated by dark spots rather than bright active regions . in contrast , in the case of gl 229 a , the data evidence that the active regions dominate the emission .",
    "these results are consistent with the chromospheric - photospheric relations observed in solar - type stars in the literature @xcite .",
    "we also analyzed simultaneous measurements of ca k and h@xmath5 fluxes obtained from our casleo spectra , and found no evident correlation between both indices , in agreement with previous results by @xcite .",
