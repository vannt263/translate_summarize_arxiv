    "the analysis of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data by combination of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) and operator product expansion ( ope ) provides us with a test site for combining both the perturbative and non - perturbative ( np ) qcd contributions in the low energy domain .",
    "in particular , the generalized ( @xmath6-dependent ) bjorken sum rule ( bsr )  @xcite is a renown target ground for testing different possibilities @xcite .",
    "fortunately , fresh jefferson lab data @xcite give information on the spin - dependent bsr amplitude @xmath7 behavior close to the confinement / hadronization scale .",
    "meanwhile , in this region the common theoretical pqcd analysis is spoiled by the unphysical singularities in the infrared ( ir ) region at a scale @xmath8 + to cure this disease ( known as the landau pole trouble ) of the pqcd expansion , we use the analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) approach @xcite based on the causality principle implemented as analyticity imperative in the complex @xmath6-plane for the qcd coupling @xmath9 in the form of the kllen - lehmann spectral representation ( for a review on apt concepts and algorithm see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in principle , the shift of the pqcd frontier ( i.e. , the boundary above which pqcd is applicable ) and the rearrangement of the total contribution between perturbative and non - perturbative terms is possible by an appropriate modification of perturbative series .",
    "examples are provided , say , by ir renormalons @xcite and the extractions of higher twists ( ht ) using various approximations of pqcd @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we systematically explore the possibility of such a shift by extracting the values of ht terms using various approximations and modifications of pt to analyse recent jlab data @xcite on the bsr .",
    "we found that a particular form of solution to the renormalization group ( rg ) equation , namely , the `` denominator '' form  @xcite ( see eq .",

    "ht coefficients decrease . at the same time",
    ", we observed that the description of the data is improved only up to the two - loop order of pt , which may be a signal of the asymptotic character of pt series in the region close to the landau pole .    a further shift of the pqcd frontier is achieved by using the analytic apt modifications of pqcd in the analysis of bsr below 1 gev making possible investigation of the interplay of pt and ht contributions . as a result",
    ", we find that while the next - to - leading twist ( @xmath10 ) term is larger in apt than in the usual pqcd , the ht ( @xmath11 ) coefficients in apt are smaller ( making the impression of ht series being convergent ) and allowing for a reasonable description of the data down to @xmath12 mev .",

    "[ fig : dual ] , we show one - parametric fits with 2,3-loop @xmath32 pqcd to the bsr .",
    "one can see there that the higher - loop contributions are effectively  absorbed `` into the value of @xmath10 which magnitude decreases with increasing of the loop order while all the fitting curves are very close to each other .",
    "this observation reveals a kind of ' ' duality \" between perturbative @xmath32-series and nonperturbative @xmath56-series .",
    "this also means the appearance of a new aspect of quark hadron duality , the latter being the necessary ingredient of all the qcd applications in the low energy domain .",
    "usually , it is assumed @xcite that the perturbative effects are less important there than the power ones due to a nontrivial structure in qcd vacuum .    in our case",
    ", the pt corrections essentially enter into the game , so that the pqcd ho terms are relevant in the domain where the concepts of traditional hadronic physics are usually applied",
    ".    the interplay between partonic and hadronic degrees of freedom in the description of gdh sr and bsr may be also observed in the surprising similarity between the results of `` resonance '' @xcite and `` parton '' @xcite approaches .    at the same time , from fig .",
    "[ fig : loop - sen ] it follows that the higher ( 3- and 4-loop ) pt orders yield a worse description of the bsr data , probably implying the asymptotic character of the series in powers of @xmath32 .",

    "[ fig : tot ] , we show best fits of the combined data set for the function @xmath104 in the pt and the apt approaches . the corresponding numerical results are given in table  [ table ] . our fit gives the ht values indicating a better convergence of the ope series due to decreasing magnitudes and alternating signs of consecutive terms , in contrast to the usual pt fit results .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is worth noting that the best apt fit allows one to describe well all the bsr data at scales down to @xmath105 mev with only the first three terms of the ope series , unlike the usual pt case , where such fits happened to be impossible ( due to the ghost issue ) even for an increasing number of ht terms .",
    "this means , that the lower bound of the pqcd applicability ( supported by power ht terms ) now may be shifted down to @xmath106 mev",
    ".    however , it seems to be difficult to get a description in the region @xmath107 .",
    "this is not surprising , because the expansion in positive powers of @xmath6 and its matching @xcite with the ht expansion are relevant here . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath108 scale appears as a natural border between  higher twist \" and `` chiral '' nonperturbative physics .",
    "the separation of perturbative and np physics may be different if some modification of perturbation theory is adopted . to test such a separation , we performed a systematic comparison of ht terms extracted from the very accurate jlab data on bsr in the framework of both the common pt and yhe apt in qcd and came to the following results .",
    "* the evidence that the `` denominator '' form ( [ denom ] ) of the qcd coupling is more suitable in the low @xmath92 region is given ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . * a kind of duality between ho of pt and ht is observed so that ho terms absorb part of ht contributions moving the pqcd frontier between the pt and ht contribution to lower @xmath92 values ( see fig .",
    "* this situation is more pronounced in the apt where convergence of both the ho and ht series is much better . while the twist-4 term happened to be larger in magnitude in the apt than in the pt ,",
    "the subsequent terms are essentially smaller and quickly decreasing ( as the apt absorbs some part of np dynamics described by ht ) .",
    "this is the second reason of the shift of pqcd frontier to lower @xmath92 values .",
    "+ as the main result , a satisfactory description of the data down to @xmath109 is achieved by taking the analytic ho and ht contributions into account simultaneously ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    in a sense , this could be natural if the main reason of such a success was the disappearance of unphysical singularities .",
    "we have in mind that the singularity - free apt and sgf qcd couplings are very close in the domain @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , various lattice data @xcite ( see also reviews @xcite and references therein ) yield similar @xmath32 curves there .",
