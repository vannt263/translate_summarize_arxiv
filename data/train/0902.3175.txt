    "[ [ background ] ] background + + + + + + + + + +    the power of quantum computing in various settings has been gradually clarified by many researchers : some problems can be solved on quantum computers much more efficiently than on classical computers , while others can not .",
    "one computational model that has been extensively studied in this light is the communication complexity model . in particular , _ one - way communication _ is one of the simplest settings but it has rich connections to areas such as information theory , coding theory , on - line computing , and learning theory .",
    "therefore , its quantum version has then been the target of intensive research @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be a boolean function , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary sets .",
    "the one - way communication task associated to @xmath14 is the following : alice has an input @xmath15 , bob has an input @xmath16 and the goal is for bob to output @xmath17 .",
    "the assumption here is that only one message can be sent , from alice to bob , and the communication cost of a protocol is the number of bits of this message on the worst - case input .",
    "we say that a protocol for @xmath14 has completeness error @xmath18 if it outputs @xmath19 with probability at least @xmath20 whenever @xmath21 , and soundness error @xmath22 if it outputs @xmath23 with probability at least @xmath24 whenever @xmath25 .",
    "the one - way classical bounded - error communication complexity of @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath26 , is the minimum , over all protocols @xmath27 for @xmath14 with completeness and soundness error @xmath28 , of the communication cost of @xmath27 .",
    "the one - way quantum bounded - error communication complexity of @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath29 , is defined similarly , but a quantum message can be used this time from alice to bob , and the number of qubits of the message is considered ( in this paper we suppose that there is no prior entanglement and no shared randomness between alice and bob ) .",
    "obviously for any function @xmath14 , the relation @xmath30 holds .",
    "one of the main open problems in quantum communication complexity is to understand how large the gap between @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be . for partial functions ( functions restricted to some domain @xmath33 or , equivalently , functions with a promise on their inputs ) ,",
    "an exponential separation between these two quantities has been shown recently in  @xcite .",
    "however the situation for total functions is far less clear : the largest gap known is an asymptotic factor of @xmath34 @xcite .    in the exact setting , i.e. , the setting where no error and no giving up are allowed , the quantum and classical one - way communication complexities are known to be the same for any total function  @xcite .  in the unbounded - error setting , i.e. , the setting where any error probability less than 1/2 is allowed , it is known that the gap is exactly a factor @xmath34 for both partial and total functions  @xcite .",
    "although bounded - error is a notion between the exact and unbounded - error , we stress that the bounded - error setting usually behaves quite differently from the other two in the case of total functions , e.g. , for two - way communication there is a quadratic gap in the bounded - error setting  @xcite whereas in the exact setting no gap is known and , in the unbounded - error setting , the gap is again exactly a factor 2  @xcite .",
    "note also that for total functions in the bounded - error setting , quadratic gaps are known in the two - way model  @xcite and exponential gaps are known in the simultaneous message - passing model  @xcite ; and these models are respectively stronger and weaker than the one - way model .  thus , whether a superlinear gap between @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be achieved for some total function is an intriguing question .    [ [ the - subgroup - membership - function ] ] the subgroup membership function + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    many of the problems for which quantum computation is more powerful than classical computation have group - theoretic structure .",
    "in particular , watrous @xcite has used the subgroup membership problem ( as a computational problem ) to separate the complexity classes @xmath35 and @xmath36 relative to an oracle .",
    "inspired by watrous s work @xcite , we propose the subgroup membership function as a candidate to show a superlinear gap between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath1 be any finite group , and let @xmath37 denote the set of subgroups of @xmath1 .",
    "then the subgroup membership function for @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath38 , is the function with domain @xmath39 such that @xmath40 for any group @xmath1 , the upper bound @xmath41 follows easily from the fact that any subgroup of @xmath1 is generated by at most @xmath42 elements .. ] furthermore , there exist families of groups @xmath1 such that @xmath43 : for example , the abelian groups @xmath44 with @xmath45 . thus there",
    "exist groups @xmath1 for which the `` trivial protocol , '' wherein alice simply sends bob the name of her subgroup , requires @xmath46 communication .",
    "the one - way classical communication complexity of the function @xmath38 was previously considered by miltersen et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that for the family of groups @xmath44 , any one - way protocol with perfect soundness and completeness error @xmath47 requires @xmath48-bit communication .  for certain groups",
    "@xmath1 , we conjecture that @xmath48-bit communication is needed even if the completeness and soundness errors are both @xmath28 .    on the other hand",
    ", there is a simple _ quantum _ one - way protocol , using @xmath49-bit communication , by which bob can compute @xmath38 with perfect completeness and constant soundness for any group @xmath1 .  in this protocol ",
    "inspired by @xcite ",
    "alice sends the quantum state @xmath50 .",
    "bob then creates the state @xmath51 where @xmath52 , applies a hadamard gate on the last register , and measures it in the basis @xmath53 to decide which of @xmath54 and @xmath55 holds .",
    "thus , proving that there exists a family of groups @xmath1 such that @xmath56 would lead to a quadratic separation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 for a total function .",
    "in other words , a major objective has been to prove a 2-sided - error version of the lower bound by miltersen et al .",
    "@xcite mentioned above .",
    "apart from the goal of proving a separation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we believe that the communication complexity of deciding subgroup membership is interesting in itself , since the latter is a key task in most group - theoretic computational problems .    [",

    "this suggests that in order to obtain a separation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 using the subgroup membership problem , one must consider groups with many nonnormal subgroups .",
    "we also present a lower bound which is tight for some families of groups .",
    "notice that this situation appears to be similar to the status of the hidden subgroup problem : there exists an efficient quantum algorithm solving the problem in the case where the hidden subgroup is normal  @xcite ; without the normality condition , however , very little is known .",
    "our results rely on the theory of characters of finite groups and especially on the connection between kernels of irreducible characters and normal subgroups , as did the algorithms of  @xcite .",

    "we remark that for any group @xmath1 of exponent @xmath62 ( which is to say that @xmath63 for all @xmath64 ) , we have @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the maximum dimension of a complex irreducible representation of @xmath1 and @xmath67 is the order of @xmath7 in @xmath68 , the multiplicative group of the integers relatively prime to @xmath62 . in particular , as there is always a prime @xmath7 of size @xmath4 relatively prime to @xmath8 , this protocol has complexity no more than @xmath69 . * finally , we show that @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the maximum dimension of an irreducible complex representation of @xmath1 .",
    "this upper bound is obtained by a protocol that mirrors the technique utilized in the modular case by suitably discretizing the vector space @xmath72 and controlling `` geometric expansion '' around invariant spaces .",
