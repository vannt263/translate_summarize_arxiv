    "since the first experimental demonstrations of bose - einstein condensation in atomic gases @xcite , we have assisted to a fantastic development of the field both on experimental and theoretical ground . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) or non - linear schrdinger equation for the condensate wave function , in its steady - state and time dependent versions , revealed itself to be an extremely powerful tool to explain most of the experimental results @xcite .    generally speaking the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "is obtained by neglecting the interaction between the condensate and non condensed particles @xcite .",
    "this approximation is justified at temperatures much below the transition temperature where the non condensed cloud is very small and much less dense that the condensate .",
    "this is often the case in experimental conditions where almost pure condensates can be obtained .",
    "there are nevertheless situations in which the rich physics coming from the non condensed fraction of the cloud and its coupling to the condensate can not be neglected . a first example concerns the collective modes of the gas induced by a modulation of the trapping potential @xcite .",
    "different theories going beyond the gross - pitaevskii equation were put forward in order to explain the temperature dependence of the frequencies and the damping rates measured in experiments @xcite ( for more references see @xcite , pages 489 - 500 ) .",
    "a second example where the non condensed fraction may play a significant role concerns condensates in thermodynamically unstable states , like vortices and dark solitons recently created experimentally @xcite . in @xcite for example one or more vortices are created by stirring the condensate with a slightly anisotropic rotating potential : vortices appear provided that the rotation frequency exceeds a critical value . if the rotation is then stopped the vortices are not any more a local minimum of energy and are expected to spiral out of the condensate @xcite .",
    "it is indeed found experimentally that the vortices leave the condensate @xcite .",
    "it is predicted theoretically that the dynamics and lifetime of the thermodynamically unstable bose - einstein condensate depend crucially on the interaction between the condensate and the non condensed cloud @xcite .",
    "the examples we have given above concern time dependent properties of the condensate .",
    "another class of interesting finite temperature issues is given by the thermal equilibrium properties of the gas .",
    "to cite some example , one might be interested in the non condensed spatial density of the atoms , or in the thermal fluctuations of the number of particles in the condensate @xcite .",
    "condensates with vortices give rise again to interesting questions in this respect such as the thermal fluctuations in the position of the vortex core and the temperature dependence of the critical rotation velocity @xcite .",
    "a well established technique to study bose - einstein condensates at thermal equilibrium is the bogolubov method , which is a perturbative method valid for low temperatures when the density of condensate particles is much larger than the density of non condensed particles .",
    "this method relies on the quadratization of the hamiltonian in the field operator representing the non condensed fraction , and on the bogolubov transform @xcite .",
    "another method which could be valid for a larger range of temperatures is the hartree - fock - bogolubov ( hfb ) method @xcite , which is instead a variational method , based on a gaussian ansatz for the system density operator . for time dependent problems ,",
    "one disposes of the former two methods , plus more refined techniques including kinetic equations for the non condensed particles @xcite .    a common point to all these methods",
    "is the necessity to calculate mean values using a density operator which is an exponential of a quadratic form in the field operator : the exponential of the quadratized hamiltonian in the case of the bogolubov approach or the gaussian ansatz for the hfb approach .",
    "the procedure that is usually followed to perform those calculations is to diagonalize the quadratic form by the bogolubov transform , turning it into a sum of decoupled harmonic oscillator energy terms .",
    "unfortunately the corresponding calculations are quite heavy for 3d non - homogeneous systems such as trapped gases , and this constitutes a serious limitation to the use of these methods .",
    "e.g.  in practice , by discretizing the real space on a grid with a modest number of @xmath0 points per spatial dimension , and in the absence of rotational symmetry ( as in a multi - vortex configuration ) one has to diagonalize a matrix which is @xmath1 $ ] large , where @xmath2 is the dimension of the space . for @xmath3 the matrix to diagonalize is @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative formulation of the bogolubov theory which can be implemented numerically more efficiently in two or three spatial dimensions since it avoids the diagonalization of _ big _ matrices .",
    "our method relies on the use of the wigner representation of the density operator and on a monte carlo simulation to sample the steady - state wigner distribution of the system at finite temperature . since our method allows to sample a",
    " gaussian \" density operator , it applies both to the bogolubov and to the hfb theory , in the thermal equilibrium as well as in the time dependent case .",
    "we give in this paper a detailed derivation of the method in the frame of a particle number conserving bogolubov theory @xcite .",
    "we consider first the thermal equilibrium case and then we show how to extend the treatment to the time dependent case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : bogol ] we recall the number - conserving version of the bogolubov theory put forward in @xcite , which we adopt in the following . in section [ sec : wigner ] we reformulate the theory by expressing the bogolubov density operator in terms of the wigner quasi - distribution function . in section [ sec : simul ] we describe the stochastic simulation that we use to sample the equilibrium wigner function . in section",
    "[ sec : resul ] we compare numerically our stochastic method to the direct diagonalization used in the traditional bogolubov approach in the case of a 1d trapped bose gas , where the explicit diagonalization is feasible , and we calculate the spatial distribution of the non condensed fraction . in section [ sec : timedep ]",
    "we show how a time dependent problem would be treated with our method .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are presented in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section we recall briefly the main ideas and results of @xcite where a number - conserving version of the bogolubov theory is established .",
    "the reader already familiar with this theory can jump directly to section [ sec : wigner ] .",

    "one is left with the quadratic hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath66    at thermal equilibrium in the canonical ensemble , the non condensed atoms are then described by the density operator : @xmath67 the usual way of proceeding at this point is to diagonalize the operator @xmath55 .",
    "let us introduce the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath55 : @xmath68 we suppose that all the eigenvalues @xmath69 are real so that the equilibrium condensate wavefunction is a dynamically stable solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",

    "physical quantities can then be readily extracted from @xmath81 .",
    "the inconvenient of this method is that the diagonalization of @xmath55 in two and three dimensions is a very heavy numerical task in the absence of particular symmetries of the problem .",
    "we wish to deal with complex numbers and complex functions instead of operators and fields @xmath82 @xmath83 for this reason we introduce the wigner quasi distribution function @xmath84 defined as the fourier transform of the characteristic function @xmath85 : @xmath86\\ ] ] and @xmath87 \\ ;      \\frac{(d \\re e \\ , \\alpha_k ) ( d \\im m \\ , \\alpha_k)}{\\pi } \\;.\\ ] ] with the diagonalized form of the quadratic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hquadrdiag ] ) , the density operator ( [ eq : sigma ] ) corresponds to decoupled harmonic oscillators at thermal equilibrium , so that : @xmath88 \\;. \\label{eq : wignerdiag}\\ ] ] in the high temperature limit @xmath89 the wigner distribution for mode @xmath90 is simply the boltzmann distribution for a classical field . in the low temperature limit @xmath91",

    ", we calculate the source term ( [ source ] ) and solve ( [ eq : evolpsi2 ] ) at steady - state with an imaginary time evolution : @xmath215 we note in this respect that the last term in ( [ source ] ) for a given realization of @xmath77 factorizes as @xmath216 times an @xmath217-independent integral over @xmath218 .    the real time evolution part ( ii ) is more straightforward since it is deterministic .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath46 evolves according to ( [ eq : gpe ] ) .",
    "each stochastic realization of @xmath77 , @xmath94 evolves according to ( [ eq : evollambda ] ) , and the corrections @xmath211 , @xmath219 evolve according to ( [ eq : evolpsi2 ] ) .",
    "the averages in the source term @xmath220 involving @xmath77 and @xmath94 must be calculated at each time step .",
    "we have put forward a monte carlo method to sample numerically the gaussian density operator for the non condensed modes obtained in the bogolubov approach , once it is expressed in term of the wigner quasi - distribution function .",
    "this method allows to implement bogolubov theory both in steady - state and in the time - dependent case without having to diagonalize big matrices , which makes it readily scalable to two or three spatial dimensions .",
    "we plan to use this method to study thermodynamics and finite temperature dynamics of bose - einstein condensates with vortices .",
    "in this paper we have sticked to the bogolubov theory as presented in @xcite . in this frame , for the time - dependent case , the gross - pitaevskii condensate wavefunction , the non condensed fraction and the first correction to the condensate wavefunction must be first obtained in the initial equilibrium state and then they must be evolved separately .",
    "a natural development of the method beyond the bogolubov approximation consists in a monte carlo simulation which samples the wigner distribution for the whole field @xmath221 in equilibrium at temperature @xmath222 followed by the real time evolution of the field according to the classical field equation : @xmath223 the classical field equation ( [ eq : class ] ) , which is formally identical to the gross - pitaevskii equation , corresponds in fact to the approximate evolution in real time of the wigner quasi distribution function ( truncated wigner ) @xcite .",
    "the classical equations of motion for the field ( [ eq : class ] ) has the disadvantage of considering only stimulated processes .",
    "consider for example two colliding condensates in three dimensions , corresponding to an initial field of the form @xmath224 by evolving this field according to ( [ eq : class ] ) we will populate only modes that are plane waves of momentum @xmath225 , @xmath33 integer ( e.g. @xmath226 corresponds to the stimulated process @xmath227 ) .",
    "in reality we expect to have binary collisions producing emerging atoms along any spatial direction . at the level of @xmath221",
    "this would require a broken translational symmetry in the @xmath228-@xmath229 transverse plane .",
    "fortunately , the advantage of being in the wigner point of view is that _ all the modes _ are initially `` filled '' by quantum noise . in this case",
    "all processes can be stimulated and all possible symmetries of @xmath221 are broken .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with gora shlyapnikov , yuri kagan and anthony leggett in the early stage of this work .",
