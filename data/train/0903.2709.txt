    "the most common method to drive a current through a conductor is by applying a voltage . in nanostructures , due to the ease with",
    "which parameters can be tuned , another possibility opens up : _ pumping .",
    "_ in an electron pump a dc current can be generated in a nanoscale conductor , even at zero - bias voltage , by periodically changing some of its properties in time .",
    "if the time dependence of the parameters is slow compared to the internal time scales of the system , such as the dwell time of carriers , pumping is adiabatic . in this case",
    ", the pumped charge does not depend on the detailed time evolution of the pumping cycle but only on its area .",
    "most of the theoretical efforts on pumping have been addressed to systems where the electron - electron interaction is weak and can , therefore , be neglected or treated in a mean - field approach.@xcite for these weakly interacting nanoscale conductors , a well - established formalism for pumping exists based on the dynamical - scattering approach to mesoscopic transport.@xcite recently , several works have investigated pumping through interacting systems.@xcite most of these works have focused on few - electron quantum dots@xcite since these systems are the prototype for nanostructures with strong interaction effects .",
    "an open question regards how the pumping characteristics of an interacting quantum dot depends on the dot s single - particle spectrum . in order to address this problem ,",
    "we have decided to study a quantum dot with a dense spectrum , i.e. , with vanishing level spacing . due to its finite density of states ,",
    "such a quantum dot is referred to as a metallic island .",
    "indeed , pumping in systems of metallic islands has been investigated experimentally already in the early 1990s.@xcite pothier _",
    "@xcite realized a single - electron pump in a setup with two tunnel - coupled metallic islands in series .",
    "pumping was obtained by changing in time the gate voltages of the two islands .",
    "the pumping cycle was chosen to enclose a degeneracy point , where three charge states of the double - island system are degenerate .",
    "this resulted in pumping of exactly one electron per cycle . to describe this experiment ,",
    "it was assumed that the system relaxes always to the ground state and that this transition occurs via first - order tunneling .",
    "although this theoretical explanation is perfectly suited to describe the pumping cycle of ref .",
    ", it would fail in describing weak pumping or pumping cycles nonencircling a degeneracy point .",
    "more experiments on charge pumping through nanostructures were performed on metallic multijunction systems ,  @xcite double quantum dots in inas quantum wires ,  @xcite or making use of surface acoustic waves .",
    "@xcite also spin pumping through a quantum dot was reported .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , we develop a diagrammatic real - time approach to adiabatic pumping in systems consisting of metallic islands . to this aim",
    ", we follow the lines of ref .  , where adiabatic pumping through a single - level quantum dot was considered .",
    "our approach relies on a systematic perturbative expansion in the tunnel - coupling strengths and therefore is restricted to weak tunnel coupling .",
    "in particular , it is not suitable to study the very - low - temperature regime , where high - order tunneling processes become relevant .",
    "however , it treats the coulomb interaction on the island exactly , allowing us to investigate effects due to strong interaction .",
    "first , we apply our formalism to a single - island system consisting of one metallic island with coulomb interaction , tunnel coupled to two noninteracting leads .",
    "we compute the pumped charge up to first order in the tunnel - coupling strength for any pair of pumping parameters chosen among the charging - energy gap of the system and the left and the right tunnel - coupling strengths . as a result",
    ", we find that the contribution in first order is due solely to the renormalization of the charging - energy gap .",
    "for the case of pumping with the two tunnel - coupling strengths , this term becomes the dominant one .",
    "furthermore , we consider pumping with the charging - energy gaps in a more complex system consisting of two tunnel - coupled metallic islands called the double - island system .",
    "we calculate the pumped charge through this system in lowest order in the tunnel - coupling strength and investigate the issue of pumped - charge quantization . with our technique",
    "we are able to describe the transition from weak to strong pumping , finding charge quantization for strong pumping .",

    "the different metallic regions are labeled by the index @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to the noninteracting metallic leads and @xmath5 to the metallic islands .",
    "the metallic islands , for typical experimental realizations , have a dense single - particle spectrum and can be treated as equilibrium reservoirs of fermionic degrees of freedom , described by a fermi function .",

    "we are interested in the dynamics of the excess charge on each island and not in the large number of noninteracting fermionic degrees of freedom which act effectively as baths.@xcite therefore , we trace over the states of the fermionic sector and we obtain the reduced density matrix @xmath33 , which just describes the charge degrees of freedom . in the basis defined by the states @xmath7 ( with excess charge @xmath6 on the island @xmath2 ) ,",
