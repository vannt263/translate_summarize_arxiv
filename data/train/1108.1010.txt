    "various energizing mechanisms for shock revival have been proposed in the text .",

    "@xcite ) in the simulation codes .",
    "however to date there have been no successfully simulated spherically symmetric explosions .",

    "neutrinos radiate around 10@xmath1 of the rest mass converting the star to a neutron star .",
    "initially the nascent neutron star is a hot thermal bath of dense nuclear matter , @xmath2 pairs , photons and neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos , having the weak interaction , are most effective in cooling and diffuse outward within a few seconds , and eventually escape with about 99@xmath1 of the released gravitational energy . despite the small neutrino - nucleus cross sections , the neutrinos flux generated by the cooling of a neutron star can produce a number of nuclear transmutations as it passes the onion - like structured envelope surrounding the neutron star .",
    "neutrinos from core - collapse supernovae are unique messengers of the microphysics of supernovae .",
    "they provide information regarding the neutronization due to electron capture , the infall phase , the formation and propagation of the shock wave and the cooling phase .",
    "cooling rate is one of the crucial parameters that strongly affect the stellar evolution . during the late stages of stellar evolution a star mainly looses energy through neutrinos .",
    "white dwarfs and supernovae ( which are the endpoints for stars of varying masses ) have both cooling rates largely dominated by neutrino production .",
    "a cooling proto - neutron star emits about @xmath3 erg in neutrinos , with the energy roughly equipartitioned among all three species .",
    "the neutrinos and antineutrinos produced as a result of nuclear reactions are transparent to the stellar matter at presupernova densities and therefore assist in cooling the core to a lower entropy state .",
    "this scenario does not necessarily hold at extremely high densities and temperatures ( this would be the case for stellar collapse where dynamical time scales become shorter than the neutrino transport time scales ) where neutrinos can become trapped in the so - called neutrinospheres mainly due to elastic scattering with nuclei . prior to stellar collapse one requires an accurate determination of neutrino energy loss rates in order to perform a careful study of the final branches of star evolutionary tracks .",
    "the neutrino and antineutrino energy loss rates can occur through four different weak - interaction mediated channels : electron and positron emissions , and , continuum electron and positron captures .",
    "the stellar neutrinos are produced due to electron captures and positron decays whereas the antineutrinos are produced due to beta decays and positron captures . as discussed above these neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) are transparent at presupernova densities and escape the site and help the core achieve a lower entropy which is of vital importance for the core to explode later .",
    "nabi and klapdor - kleingrothaus @xcite first reported the calculation of weak interaction rates for 709 nuclei with a = 18 to 100 in stellar environment using the pn - qrpa theory .",
    "the authors then presented a detailed calculation of stellar weak interaction rates over a wide range of temperature and density scale for fp / fpg - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "because of the high temperatures prevailing during the presupernova and supernova phase of a massive star , there is a reasonable probability of occupation of parent excited states and the total weak interaction rates have a finite contribution form these excited states .",
    "the pn - qrpa theory allows a microscopic state - by - state calculation of _ all _ these partial rates and this feature of the model greatly enhances the reliability of the calculated rates in stellar matter .",
    "the pn - qrpa model can handle any arbitrarily heavy system of nucleons as it has access to a luxurious model space of up to @xmath4 shells .",
    "the pn - qrpa model was successfully used to calculate weak interaction rates on important iron - regime nuclei ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "weak interaction rates on hundreds of nuclei are involved in the complex dynamics of stellar evolution culminating in a supernova explosion .",
    "a search for key weak interaction nuclei in presupernova evolution was performed by aufderheide and collaborators @xcite .",
    "late phases of evolution ( namely after core silicon burning ) in massive stars were considered and a search was performed for the most important electron captures and @xmath5-decay nuclei in these scenarios .",
    "the lists consisted of dozens of iron - regime nuclei . from these lists electron captures on @xmath6ti and @xmath5-decay of @xmath7ti were short - listed to be of astrophysical importance .",
    "previously nabi and collaborators @xcite presented a detailed analysis of the calculation of stellar electron capture rates on twenty two titanium isotopes .",
    "out of these twenty two isotopes of titanium seven isotopes , namely @xmath8ti , are suggested to be important in cooling the core of massive stars through the ( anti)neutrino produced via the weak interaction reactions . in this paper",

    "the story reverses with neutrino energy loss rates assuming the role of the dominant partner . at low densities",
    "the antineutrino energy loss rates have a dominant contribution from the positron captures on @xmath43ti . as temperature rises or density lowers ( the degeneracy parameter is negative for positrons ) , more and more high - energy positrons are created leading in turn to higher positron capture rates and consequently higher antineutrino energy loss rates . for the remaining isotopes of titanium considered in this study the antineutrino energy loss rates are dominated by the @xmath5-decay of these isotopes , except when the stellar core attains high temperature ( t@xmath42 \\sim 30 $ ] ) .",

    "looking at the lower panel one sees a staggering 8 orders of magnitude bigger ffn rates at low temperatures and densities .",
    "however for the same temperature and density domain the reported rates are in good agreement with the corresponding lssm rates hinting towards the fact that ffn overestimated their antineutrino energy loss rates .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these antineutrino energy loss rates are very small numbers ( @xmath63 ) and can change by orders of magnitude by a mere change of 0.5 mev , or less , in parent or daughter excitation energies and are more reflective of the uncertainties in the calculation of energies .",
    "the comparison is again good at t@xmath42 = 30 $ ] .",
    "finally i present the comparison of antineutrino energy loss rates due to @xmath64ti with earlier calculations in figure  [ figure7 ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the fact that the pn - qrpa rates are in good comparison with the lssm rates ( within a factor of 5 ) except at t@xmath42 = 30 $ ] where the reported rates are bigger than two orders of magnitude .",

    "unmeasured matrix elements for allowed transitions were assigned an average value of @xmath655 in ffn calculations . on the other hand",
    "these transitions were calculated in a microscopic fashion using the pn - qrpa theory ( and the large scale shell model ) and depict a more realistic picture of the events taking place in stellar environment .",
    "isotopes of titanium are amongst the key iron - regime nuclei that play a consequential role in the late phases of stellar evolution of massive stars .",
    "the weak - interaction mediated reactions on these nuclei , namely electron capture and @xmath5-decay , change the lepton - to - baryon fraction ( @xmath36 ) during the late phases of stellar evolution .",
    "the electron capture contributes in decreasing @xmath36 while the @xmath5-decay causes an increment in the @xmath36 value .",
    "the temporal variation of @xmath36 within the core of a massive star has a pivotal role to play in the stellar evolution and a fine - tuning of this parameter at various stages of presupernova evolution is the key to generate an explosion .",
    "the neutrinos and antineutrinos produced as a result of these weak interaction reactions are transparent to the stellar matter at presupernova densities and therefore assist in cooling the core to a lower entropy state .",
    "a lower entropy environment can assist to achieve higher densities for the ensuing collapse generating a stronger bounce and in turn forming a more energetic shock wave .",
