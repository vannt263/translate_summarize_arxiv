    "when quantum particles in a periodic potential of period @xmath0 are subject to a weak additional constant force @xmath1 they do not uniformly accelerate like free particles , but instead undergo bloch oscillations @xcite at an angular frequency given by : @xmath2 bloch oscillations ( bos ) of cold atoms in optical lattices were first observed in 1996 by uniformly accelerating the lattice @xcite : in a frame co - moving with the lattice the atoms experience a constant force . at about the same time , the accelerating lattice method was used to observe wannier - stark ladders @xcite , which are a different aspect of the same `` tilted lattice '' physics .",
    "the method has subsequently been employed to realize beam splitters for atom optics capable of large momentum transfers , see , e.g.  @xcite .    in gravity - driven bos",
    "the lattice is held fixed in space but oriented vertically so that gravity provides the force @xmath3 on the atoms ( of mass @xmath4 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : blochfrequency ] ) , a measurement of @xmath5 corresponds to a measurement of the applied force @xmath1 if we know @xmath6 .",
    "this bloch oscillator may be viewed as an interferometer in momentum space @xcite and has been experimentally demonstrated by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "for example , the experiment @xcite used gravity - driven bos of strontium atoms to measure the local acceleration due to gravity at the level of @xmath7 . like any interferometer",
    ", long coherence times are crucial for precision measurements and in @xcite the bos were coherent over 7 s , corresponding to @xmath8 oscillations .",
    "this remarkable degree of coherence was greatly facilitated by the choice of strontium atoms , which have very weak @xmath9-wave scattering , and thus dynamical instabilities normally associated with superflow in lattices @xcite were highly suppressed .",
    "variations on this scheme that improve the visibility of the bos , including frequency @xcite and amplitude @xcite modulation of the lattice , have allowed for the measurement of gravity at the level of @xmath10 . in these latest experiments",
    "the bos were coherent for over 20 seconds .",
    "the experiments referred to above all involve destructive measurements of the bos due to the nature of the imaging process of the atoms , whether it be _ in situ _ or by a time - of - flight technique after the lattice has been switched off @xcite .",
    "therefore , a precision measurement of @xmath5 by the above methods requires that the experiment be re - run many times , each run being for a slightly different hold time , so that the oscillations can be accurately mapped out .",
    "this not only takes a long time , but also requires that the initial conditions be recreated as faithfully as possible for each run .",
    "in @xcite we proposed a scheme for continuous ( i.e.  non - destructive ) measurements of bos based upon placing the atoms inside a fabry - perot optical resonator which would allow for an estimate of @xmath5 from the data acquired over a single run .",
    "a related scheme has also been independently proposed for ring cavities @xcite . the periodic potential is now provided by the standing wave of light which forms inside the cavity when it is pumped by a laser . orienting the cavity vertically , the atoms execute bos along the cavity axis as depicted in fig.[fig : schemepic ] .",
    "the enhanced atom - light coupling inside a high - q cavity means that the oscillating atoms imprint a detectable periodic modulation on both the phase and amplitude of the light which can be seen either in transmission or reflection .",
    "thus , the measurement is performed upon the light leaking out of the cavity rather than directly upon the atoms .    the strong atom - light coupling that can be realized in cavity - qed stands in contrast to the case of optical lattices in free space where the atoms exert only a tiny backaction upon the light .",
    "the optical dipole interaction between a single cavity photon and a single atom is characterized by the rabi frequency @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the frequency and volume of the relevant cavity mode and @xmath14 is the atomic transition dipole moment . defining the cooperativity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the spontaneous emission rate of the atom in free space and @xmath17 is the energy damping rate of the cavity",
    ", @xmath18 is the number of atoms required to strongly perturb the light field .",
    "the normal mode splitting that results from strong coupling has been directly observed in a number of cold atom optical cavity experiments @xcite . in the experiment @xcite , which was performed with a bose - einstein condensate ,",
    "the cooperativity was @xmath19 .",
    "even more pertinently , these systems have been used to detect the presence of single atoms @xcite , as well as to follow their dynamics in real time @xcite .",
    "the collective dynamics of ultracold atomic gases have also been tracked using cavities @xcite .",
    "the key experimental steps necessary for the continuous monitoring of bos in a cavity have , therefore , already been demonstrated .",
    "the drawback with any continuous measurement scheme is measurement backaction . in cavities",
    "this backaction typically takes the form of cavity photon number fluctuations which lead to random force fluctuations on the atoms , as is evident in the erratic nature of the single atom trajectories seen in the experiments @xcite referred to above . in the many atom context",
    ", quantum measurement backaction generally manifests itself in a heating of the atom cloud ( although under some circumstances it can lead to cooling @xcite ) . in the cavity - optomechanical regime ( where the collective motion can be modelled as a harmonic oscillator of angular frequency @xmath20 )",
    "the heating rate is expected to be @xmath21 @xcite , where @xmath22 is the zero - point fluctuation and @xmath23 is the spectral density of the force fluctuations ( which is directly proportional to the cavity photon number fluctuations ) .",
    "this heating rate is in agreement with observations when convolved with technical fluctuations @xcite .    in the system considered in this paper",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schemepic ] ) , we can divide the backaction into two types .",
    "one type comes from the fact that the atoms sit in an optical lattice whose depth is periodically modulated in time at the frequency @xmath5 due to the effect of bos .",
    "this backaction is a classical effect in the sense that it occurs even when the light field is treated classically ( no photons ) .",
    "the nonlinearity that arises from this backaction can lead to swallowtail loops in the atomic band structure @xcite that mimics the effects of direct atom - atom interactions @xcite .",
    "these loops are the counterpart in the atomic wave function of optical bistability in the light @xcite .",
    "the second type of backaction arises only when the fluctuations due to the discrete photon nature of the light field are taken into account and is related to the heating effect mentioned above .",
    "the characteristic frequency of these latter fluctuations is @xmath24 which is much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the first type of backaction was analyzed in our previous paper @xcite where our main aim was to show that , despite the self - generated time modulation of the intracavity optical lattice , the bloch acceleration theorem still applies and the bo frequency is not modified ( although harmonics can be generated ) .",
    "this latter result is clearly very important if the cavity bo method is to be used for precision measurements and may be viewed as a consequence of the fact that the formula ( [ eq : blochfrequency ] ) does not depend on the depth of the lattice , only its spatial period .",
    "an estimate of the effects of the second type of backaction was also given in our previous paper , but this estimate was obtained under the assumption that the photon number fluctuations were purely due to the photon shot noise found in a coherent state of light .",
    "this ignores the correlations that build up between the atoms and the light inside the cavity and our main aim in this paper is to solve the dynamics of the coupled photon and atom fluctuations systematically from first principles and thereby capture these correlations .",
    "this will allow us to properly determine the sensitivity of the measurement of the bloch frequency to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] we introduce the physical system , the associated hamiltonian , and the equations of motion .",
    "we then review in sections [ sec : meanfield ] and [ sec : mftresults ] the meanfield approximation and the associated numerical results which were the focus of our previous paper @xcite , before introducing in section [ sec : fluctlin ] the main model to be treated in this paper which adds quantum fluctuations .",
    "this is an elaboration of the linearization approach presented in , e.g.@xcite , to include a time - dependent meanfield component ( due to the bos ) .",
    "the fluctuations correspond to quasiparticles ( excitations out of the meanfield ) , and their spectrum is analyzed in section [ sec : excspect ] and then used to help interpret the numerical results for the quantum dynamics presented in section [ sec : fluctdyn ] .",
    "we also develop a simple rate equation picture , valid in the weak coupling regime , to help us understand the rate of quasiparticle excitation . following this we change gears slightly and apply the above results to investigate how quantum fluctuations affect a precision measurement of @xmath5 by calculating the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "we present the theory lying behind these calculations in section [ sec : snr ] and in section [ sec : snrresults ] we examine the results , paying particular attention to whether or not there is an optimal value for the atom - light coupling parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we also present results illustrating the dependence of the snr on other system parameters such as the number of atoms and the intracavity lattice depth .",
    "we summarize our results and give some further perspective in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we have also provided three appendices that give details omitted from the main text : the first derives an approximation wherein the cavity field is assumed to be in a coherent state and the atomic fluctuations about the meanfield are treated as independent oscillators , the second discusses the effects that bos have on cavity cooling , and the third discusses our approach to calculating two - time correlation functions .",
    "our system consists of a gas of @xmath26 bosonic atoms inside a vertically oriented fabry - perot optical cavity . a single cavity mode of frequency @xmath12",
    "is coherently pumped by a laser with frequency @xmath27 that is detuned from both the atomic and the cavity resonance frequencies .",
    "this sets up a standing wave mode along the cavity axis of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the relevant frequency relations are characterized by the two detunings @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the atomic transition frequency . in the dispersive regime ,",
    "the occupation of the excited atomic state is vanishingly small and it can be adiabatically eliminated . a one - dimensional hamiltonian for the atom - cavity system in the dispersive regime can then be written as @xcite @xmath32 { \\ensuremath{\\hat{\\psi } } } ,      \\label{eq : hamiltonian }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the field operators for the atoms and the cavity photons which obey the equal time bosonic commutation relations @xmath35=\\delta(x - x')$ ] , and @xmath36=1 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the single atom dispersive light shift has been denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the hamiltonian has been written in a frame rotating with the pump laser frequency @xmath27 , and this leads to the appearance of the two detunings .",
    "the first term is just the free evolution of the cavity mode .",
    "the second term represents the laser coherently pumping the cavity at rate @xmath38 , and the third term describes the atomic part of the hamiltonian . the first two terms of the atomic part represent the kinetic energy and a light induced potential energy .",
    "this latter term can either be understood as the atom moving in a periodic potential with average amplitude @xmath39 or , if combined with the first term in the hamiltonian , as a shift in the resonance frequency of the cavity due to the coupling between the atom and the field .",
    "the third term in the atomic part provides the external force that drives the bos .",
    "we assume this force arises from the vertical orientation ( @xmath40 increases in the downward direction ) of the cavity and is given by @xmath41 .",
    "we have not included direct atom - atom interactions in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) because under realistic experimental conditions they are three orders of magnitude smaller than the recoil energy @xmath42 which characterizes the single - particle energy ( kinetic and potential ) of an atom in an optical lattice .",
    "consider , for example , the meanfield interaction energy per particle @xmath43 for a cloud of @xmath44 @xmath45rb atoms trapped in a 178 @xmath14 m long cavity @xcite .",
    "here @xmath46 nm is the @xmath9-wave scattering length .",
    "we take the normalized 3d wave function @xmath47 to be the product of a ground band bloch wave that extends 178 @xmath14 m along @xmath40 and a gaussian 25 @xmath14 m wide in the transverse plane . then , evaluating the bloch wave for a lattice which is 3 @xmath48 deep and made from @xmath49 nm light ( 456 wells are occupied ) , we find the ratio @xmath50 .",
    "the interactions can be tuned to smaller values still using a feshbach resonance : the experiment @xcite increased the dephasing time of bos from a few oscillations to 20,000 using this technique .",
    "the fact that the atoms all interact with a common light field whose magnitude is modified by the sum of their individual couplings gives rise to a nonlinearity ( the classical backaction referred to above ) that is in some ways analogous to that due to direct interactions @xcite , but in other ways differs and can lead to novel behavior @xcite .",
    "natural units for the length and energy in cavity - qed are given by @xmath51 and the recoil energy @xmath48 , respectively . from here on we scale all lengths by @xmath51 and consequently define @xmath52 . we scale frequencies by the recoil frequency @xmath53 and time by @xmath54 and retain the same symbols for the scaled variables",

    "physically , their origin is vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field that are transmitted into the cavity via the mirrors and they thus only appear in the equations for the light field .",
    "nevertheless , the noise is conveyed to the atomic dynamics by the atom - light coupling .",
    "the approach we follow in this paper is based upon a separation of the field operators into meanfield and quantum parts : @xmath59 in the meanfield approximation the light is assumed to be in a classical state with amplitude @xmath60 , where @xmath61 corresponds to the average number of photons in the cavity , and the atoms are assumed to all share the same single - particle wave function @xmath62 .",

    "the expectation value @xmath66 that appears in the first of these equations provides the time - dependent coupling between the atomic probability density and the cavity mode function .",
    "multiplying this integral is the collective atom - cavity coupling parameter @xmath67 .",
    "when measured in units of the cavity linewidth we denote this parameter by @xmath68 @xmath69 we illustrate the effect that @xmath68 has on the meanfield dynamics in figs.[fig : mftlatplotdc1_changecoup ] and [ fig : latticedepth&ft ] below .    in reference",
    "@xcite we studied the influence the classical backaction nonlinearity has upon the band structure of atom - cavity systems .",
    "the band structure is given by the steady state solutions [ @xmath70 , @xmath71 of the coupled equations of motion ( [ eq : mftlight ] ) and ( [ eq : mftatom ] ) in the absence of the external force @xmath72 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that , despite the nonlinearity , exact solutions of the steady state problem are given by mathieu functions ( like in the linear problem of a quantum particle in a fixed cosine potential ) .",

    "is restricted to lie in the first brillouin zone @xmath77 . substituting the bloch wave solution into the equations of motion",

    "it is important to appreciate that this band structure is not for the atoms alone , but for the combined atom - cavity system .",
    "for example , the eigenvalue @xmath14 is actually a chemical potential rather than the band energy ( for the underlying energy functional with the light adiabatically eliminated see @xcite ) , and another difference from the linear case is that the lattice depth @xmath80 is not fixed , but instead depends on the values of @xmath81 .",
    "so , for example , the lattice depth changes during a bo as @xmath74 is swept along the band .",
    "the external force @xmath72 breaks the spatial periodicity and means that bloch waves are replaced by wannier - stark states as the stationary solutions of the equations of motion ( in fact , in finite systems the wannier - stark states are resonances rather than true eigenstates @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial periodicity can be restored by applying the unitary transformation @xmath82 which removes the @xmath83 term appearing in the hamiltonian in the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : mftatom ] ) and introduces a shift @xmath84 into the momentum operator @xmath85 we denote the frame resulting from this transformation as the transformed frame ( tf ) , and the original frame as the lab frame ( lf ) .",
    "let us now consider the dynamics under the influence of the force term .",
    "we take the initial atomic state @xmath86 to be a bloch state in the ground band with quasimomentum @xmath87 . in the adiabatic approximation",
    "the atoms remain in the ground band but the force causes the quasimomentum to sweep periodically through the first brillouin zone in accordance with the bloch acceleration theorem @xmath88 as can be seen by comparing eqns .",
    "( [ eq : atomsteady ] ) and ( [ eq : sphtrans ] ) .",
    "in fact , a careful analysis @xcite shows that eq .",
    "( [ eq : blochaccthm ] ) holds even when adiabaticity is broken and interband transitions are allowed providing these transitions are `` vertical '' , i.e. they conserve @xmath74 .    this standard approach to bos remains valid even when the lattice depth is modulated in time , as takes place in cavities , because amplitude modulation does not break the spatial periodicity of the potential and so can not change @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we therefore find that at any later time @xmath89 , the _ exact _ atomic meanfield can be expressed as @xmath90 \\mathcal{u}(t ) \\ .\\ ] ] in general @xmath91 is in a superposition of bands and so is no longer the steady state solution of eqns .",
    "( [ eq : lightsteady ] ) and ( [ eq : atomsteady ] ) , although it does retain its bloch form .",
    "the advantage of the tf is that the quasimomentum is frozen at its initial value and we have @xmath92 \\mathcal{u}(t)\\ ] ] so that it is only the spatially periodic function @xmath91 that evolves in time . from the point of view of numerical computation",
    "this allows us to work with a basis of periodic functions ( we normalize our wave functions over one period of the lattice ) . at",
    "any given time a relatively small number of basis functions can accurately describe the atomic meanfield state and this greatly reduces the numerical effort in the calculation of bos .    by working in terms of bloch waves ,",
    "our approach is predisposed towards treating wave functions which are localized in momentum space rather than coordinate space .",
    "this choice is sensible because momentum space is a natural setting for bos as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : blochaccthm ] ) .",
    "this is also in line with existing experiments demonstrating cold atom bos in free space optical lattices @xcite , where the initial state is generally a fairly narrow wavepacket in momentum space . in this paper",
    "we shall therefore restrict ourselves to states that are completely localised in quasimomentum ( @xmath93-function wave packet ) .     in units of the atomic recoil frequency @xmath94 plotted as a function of time .",
    "the curves , which are each for a different value of the collective atom - cavity coupling parameter @xmath95 , were obtained by solving the meanfield equations of motion eqns.([eq : mftlight ] ) and ( [ eq : mftatom ] ) and illustrate the fact that the change in lattice depth over one bloch oscillation increases with @xmath95 . in order to maintain a minimum lattice depth of @xmath96 as @xmath95 was increased by changing @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , we also changed the pumping strength as @xmath99 , giving mean photon numbers @xmath100 , respectively .",

    "if the lattice becomes too deep the contrast decreases ( see fig.[fig : snrfnlatdtcorr ] below and also fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "a depth of @xmath117 gives a reasonable compromise .",

    "[ fig : snrfnlatdtcorr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : linincdeplat ] ) .",
    "this also allows us to make comparisons between the effects of different parameter values upon , e.g.   the quantum fluctuations , whilst keeping the atomic meanfield dynamics as similar as possible .    as the coupling @xmath68",
    "is increased other effects appear apart from an increase in the contrast .",
    "these effects are visible in fig .",

    "referring to the fourier transform of @xmath113 plotted in fig.[fig : mftlatftatsnrdip ] , we see that the basic bo dynamics is governed by the fundamental @xmath5 and its low lying harmonics , whereas the fast oscillations are clustered around the tenth harmonic ( see inset ) and include a continuum of frequencies with some peaks at half harmonics . in this context",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the band gaps change continuously in time as @xmath74 is swept through the brillouin zone and so a range of frequencies is to be expected .",
    "the precision to which @xmath5 can be measured in the scheme proposed in this paper depends upon the contrast . from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mftlatplotdc1_changecoup ] it may therefore seem that in order to make the most sensitive measurement possible one should choose @xmath68 to be as large as possible . however , this is false for two reasons .",
    "one is the effect of quantum fluctuations due to measurement backaction which is also controlled by @xmath68 and will be the focus of section [ sec : snr ] .",
    "another reason , which enters even at the meanfield level , is the possibility of bistability in cavity photon number for large values of @xmath68 ( when the pumping is sufficiently large ) . in @xcite this bistability",
    "was studied experimentally in a uniform unaccelerated condensate , which in our language has a quasimomentum @xmath106 . in @xcite",
    "we studied this problem theoretically and generalized it to include finite @xmath74 : we showed that bistability arises from the appearance of swallowtail loops in the bands . in the semiclassical picture of a bo the quasimomentum scans adiabatically through the entire band and so when it encounters a swallowtail loop the system can follow a branch that suddenly terminates at some later time , leading to fundamentally nonadiabatic behavior @xcite .",
    "hence , in a scheme to measure bos , it would be better to be in a parameter regime where the cavity is not bistable for any value of @xmath74 . in fig .",

    "[ fig : pumpstdc1_bistregime ] , let us now explain how we chose the rest of the system parameters used in the calculations .",

    "the latter is intuitively plausible too , but , however , can not be the whole truth because , as stated above , it neglects the effect of measurement backaction upon the dynamics which is expected to become important at larger values of @xmath68 . when fluctuations are included @xmath255 , and the mean signal amplitude is given by @xmath256 in fact , this is not",
    "so very different from the meanfield photon number given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : signalmft ] ) because we are by design working in a regime where the meanfield dominates the fluctuations .",

    "the expression for the signal variance including fluctuations is cumbersome and is presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : varoutphotds ] ) in appendix [ app : corrcalc ] . for present purposes",
    "it is enough to note that it includes a collection of terms that depend on integrals over two - time correlations of the photon fluctuations .",
    "these two - time correlations are challenging to evaluate numerically not only because the fluctuations occur on time scales @xmath257 much shorter than the bos , but also because they require the storage and manipulation of data at two times .",
    "furthermore , the continuous driving by the bos means that the correlations are not stationary in time , i.e.  they do not just depend on @xmath258 , and this forces us to calculate the snr in parallel to the system dynamics starting at @xmath105 .",
    "unfortunately , due to limited computing power , we have only been able to track the snr over ten bloch periods which is certainly shorter than the coherence time of the bos for the parameters we use .",

    "the main steps of our algorithm for calculating the two time correlations are provided in appendix [ app : corrcalc ] .",
    "we now show how the snr depends on the various system parameters . due to the size of parameter space , this will not be an exhaustive study , but rather an _",
    "ad hoc _ choice that nevertheless we hope is experimentally relevant .",
    "we begin by looking at the snr as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrfnofcoup1 ] we plot the snr evaluated at @xmath5 for an integration time of 10 bloch periods .",
    "we change @xmath68 by increasing @xmath128 but also change @xmath38 to maintain the same minimum lattice depth of @xmath96 throughout .",
    "the results without measurement backaction ( i.e. the dynamics in the cavity is purely meanfield ) are plotted by the red ( dots ) curve which monotonically increases until about @xmath259 .",

    "the turnover of the red curve near @xmath259 is in a sense an artefact that arises from having evaluated our snr at @xmath5 : it so turns out from the meanfield solution that for @xmath260 the fraction of the power in the fundamental of @xmath261 begins to decline and is diverted to higher harmonics .",
    "however , there is no real reason other than simplicity to only consider snr@xmath262 ( any harmonic of @xmath5 gives information about the applied force and inclusion of all of them in the data analysis would extract the maximum possible information from the measurement ) .",
    "the full calculation including measurement backaction is plotted by the black ( crosses ) curve .",
    "the first thing to notice is that measurement backaction always lowers the snr .",
    "secondly , the full snr monotonically increases only until @xmath263 , and thereafter suffers from dramatic dips which we explain below as being due to resonances with quasiparticle excitation energies .",
    "these two observations are the main results of this paper . in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrfnoftimenearpeak ] we plot the snr as function of the total integration time @xmath154 for three values of @xmath68 , two before the first dip in the snr and one in it .",
    "this plot further illustrates that for @xmath264 there is a dramatic lowering of the snr .",

    "the lattice depth is changed by increasing @xmath38 .",
    "the red ( dots ) curve gives the snr calculated using only meanfield dynamics plus the effect of shot noise at the detector and justifies the comment made in section [ sec : mftresults ] that for larger lattice depth the contrast decreases .",

    "we also scale the pump strength @xmath38 to maintain the same intracavity lattice depth @xmath113 in all the cases . as we pointed out in section",
    "[ sec : mftresults ] , this method of scaling the system variables leaves the form of the meanfield and fluctuation equations unchanged .",
    "the only quantitative change is that the meanfield cavity field solution @xmath63 is scaled by the same @xmath266 factor as the pumping .",
    "this leads to a linear scaling of the snr as a function of @xmath26 ( with and without fluctuations ) as shown in the plot .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rate of increase is different for the calculation including fluctuations compared to that without .",
    "clearly there is a gain in the snr with @xmath26 .",
    "finally , we shall explain the physical origin of the complicated series of dips in the snr when @xmath267 that are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrfnofcoup1 ] . consider the spectrum of quasiparticle excitations about the adiabatic meanfield solution introduced in section [ sec : excspect ] .",
    "for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrealplotdc1_coup2 ] , the smallest excitation frequency occurs at the band edge @xmath196 and the largest at @xmath106 .",
    "as @xmath68 is increased in the usual manner ( holding the minimum lattice depth constant ) , the @xmath74-dependence of the quasiparticle spectrum evolves , as shown for the quasiparticle mode @xmath268 in fig .",
    "[ fig : specreseff ] .",
    "thus , the range of frequencies ( i.e.  across the entire brillouin zone ) contained in @xmath268 also evolves with @xmath68 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpergfnofcoup ] .",
    "if the meanfield dynamics happens to contain any frequencies that fall in this range there is clearly the possibility of a resonance , exciting quasiparticles and lowering the snr .",
    "this is exactly what happens as can be seen from fig.[fig : atomfluctnumres ] which plots the total power in the harmonics of @xmath5 that fall in the frequency range covered by @xmath268 .",
    "the two peaks in fig.[fig : atomfluctnumres ] at @xmath269 and @xmath270 coincide exactly with the dips in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrfnofcoup1 ] . referring back to the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : mftlatftatsnrdip ] , which was deliberately evaluated at @xmath271 for this very purpose , we can see the part of the meanfield spectrum that falls in the range spanned by @xmath268 . in the absence of bos",
    "the quasiparticle excitation @xmath268 is very narrow , with a width given by the imaginary part @xmath272 evaluated at @xmath106 .",
    "however , the bo dynamics effectively broadens the resonance by orders of magnitude to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpergfnofcoup ] and this has a dramatic effect on the snr .",
    "in this paper we have extended our previous analysis of bloch oscillations of ultracold atoms inside a cavity to include the effects of quantum noise in the electromagnetic field .",
    "the quantum noise originates from the open nature of the cavity and can be interpreted as a form of quantum measurement backaction because it perturbs the dynamics .",
    "the magnitude of the backaction is controlled by the dimensionless atom - light coupling parameter @xmath273 and we find that it can strongly affect the sensitivity of a measurement of the bloch oscillation frequency @xmath5 and therefore the determination of the magnitude of the external force @xmath1 driving them .",
    "our treatment is based upon the coupled heisenberg equations of motion for the atoms and light which we linearize about their meanfield solutions , i.e.  a bogoliubov level approximation .",
    "we solve the _ time - dependent _ meanfield level dynamics exactly and hence coherent effects such as landau - zener tunneling between bands are fully taken into account .",
    "a spectral decomposition of the meanfield solution shows that it is dominated by @xmath5 and its first few harmonics , but as @xmath68 is increased spectral power begins to spread to higher frequencies .",
    "quantum noise is introduced via langevin operators which act as inhomogeneous source terms in the heisenberg equations .",
    "these terms excite quasiparticles ( quantized excitations with a mixed atom - light character ) out of the meanfield . in the standard situation @xcite",
    "where there is no external force then if the system is started off with no quasiparticles their number initially grows in time but eventually saturates due to competition between cooling and heating processes ( provided we are in the cooling regime @xmath274 which means that the quasiparticle energy has a negative imaginary part ) .",
    "by contrast , in this work we have found that the presence of an external force , and hence bos , profoundly changes this behaviour so that following some initial transients the heating rate settles down to a constant value even when we are nominally in the cooling regime .",
    "nevertheless , for the parameter regimes we tested the heating rate was modest and the fraction of the atoms excited out of the coherent meanfield over the lifetime of the simulation was always less than 1% even for quite strong coupling .    in order to gain some insight into the numerical calculations we used fermi s golden rule to develop a semi - analytic model for the heating rate in terms of a simple rate equation for the number of atomic excitations . in so doing we approximated the cavity light field by a coherent state whose quantum fluctuations are the same as those of the vacuum .",
    "this is a common approximation in cavity optomechanics but ignores the quantum correlations that build up between the atoms and the light . comparing this with the exact numerical results for the number of atomic excitations",
    ", we infer that the field is close to a coherent state for small @xmath68 , but differs from it as @xmath68 is increased , as expected .",
    "furthermore , this comparison allowed us to see the dynamic generation of atom - light correlations .",
    "the above calculations can be applied to the estimation of the signal - to - noise ratio for a continuous measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , we find that the snr decreases with intracavity lattice depth , and increases with the number of atoms . our principal result , however , concerns the dependence upon @xmath68 .",
    "we find that the snr can be severely reduced due to resonances between the quasiparticle spectrum and the bloch oscillating meanfield for certain ranges of @xmath68 . indeed ,",
    "the snr behaviour depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrplots1 ] is much more complicated than that found in the standard example of a quantum limited position measurement of a harmonic oscillator , e.g.  the end mirror of a resonant cavity @xcite . in that system",
    ", the snr is determined by the competition between the `` measurement imprecision '' ( detector shot noise ) , which decreases with increasing measurement strength , and the measurement backaction , which increases with increasing measurement strength , and correlations between the two can be ignored to a good approximation .",
    "this leads to a smooth curve ( see fig .  5 on p.1171 of the review @xcite ) with a single maximum at the measurement strength where the two effects are equal .",
    "this is where the measurement should be performed for maximum sensitivity . by contrast , in our case we have a cloud of atoms occupying bloch states in an optical lattice and thus our system does not correspond very well to a single harmonic oscillator ( except in the limit where the lattice is extremely weak so that the atoms are predominantly in a state which is uniform in space @xcite , but then landau - zener tunneling will be so severe that the atoms will quickly fall out of the lattice when the external force @xmath1 is applied ) . add to this the fact that our system is driven by an external force and so scans through the entire bloch band in a time - dependent fashion , leading to the possibility of resonances , and it is not surprising that our resulting snr in fig.[fig : snrfnofcoup1 ] does not have a simple maximum as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "however , we can make the parameter dependent statement that it seems safest to choose @xmath275 which lies below the point where the resonances set in ( and for @xmath276 we find optical bistability which will destroy the bloch oscillations @xcite ) .",
    "the resonances only occur in the calculation when quantum measurement backaction is included and so provide a salutary example of when the latter is important . nevertheless , away from the resonances",
    "the snr for this continuous measurement is large and is in pretty good agreement with an approximate calculation based upon purely meanfield dynamics in the cavity plus detector shot noise .    in comparison to previously studied cold atom cavity - qed systems , or even cavity optomechanical systems , a new feature of our bloch oscillating system is the time - dependence of the meanfield . apart from the resonances discussed above , this also has implications for the computational scheme we use to calculate the results .",
    "for example , all the fluctuation modes should be orthogonal to the meanfield mode as well as to each other , and hence they also evolve with time .",
    "furthermore , the two - time correlation functions that are needed to calculate the signal variance that enters the snr are not stationary in time , meaning that a large amount of data must be stored .",
    "this is especially true because the bloch period is roughly three orders of magnitude larger than the quantum fluctuation timescale @xmath277 and hence the calculation of the snr over even a few bloch periods is quite intensive in the regime where the coherent state approximation breaks down .",
    "in non - cavity bo experiments it has been shown that coherent dynamics can run for thousands of bloch periods @xcite . in a continuous measurement scheme , such as",
    "that proposed here , the quantum measurement backaction reduces the coherence time but unfortunately we have been unable to go much beyond ten bloch periods with our numerical computations of the snr and thereby find this coherence time for our scheme ( we have , however , given an estimate in @xcite based upon the idea that the spontaneous emission rate sets the upper limit on coherent dynamics ) .",

    "hence the dominant contribution comes from adjacent levels i.e.  @xmath286 and is given by @xmath287 where the second line is obtained by taking a derivative of the instantaneous hamiltonian and realizing that , due to the opposing relative parity of adjacent states , the term in the overlap integral due to the potential is zero .",
    "the above term can be neglected if the bloch frequency is small compared to the energy gap @xmath288 . to proceed",
    "further we will assume that this is the case but in the next appendix we will see that this can not be guaranteed in general .",
    "specifically , this approximation is most likely to break down at the times when the quasimomentum comes close to the center or the edge of the brillouin zone where there are avoided crossings .",
    "thus , this calculation will be valid only for short times ( since at longer times the system will have repeatedly gone through such crossings ) and/or at parameter regimes where the gaps are large compared to bloch frequency .",

    "this shifting helps in removing the slow time dependence of the couplings @xmath305 ( derived from the meanfield bloch oscillations ) . since the damping and diffusion rates for the different oscillators are not the same , it is in general not possible to write down an equation similar in form to eq .",

    "cavity cooling occurs when the effective detuning @xmath306 is negative .",
    "this ensures that the quasiparticle energies have a negative imaginary part @xmath307 which implies dynamical stability as explained in section [ sec : excspect ] . under these circumstances @xmath187 reaches a steady state and the heating rate vanishes as shown in the inset in fig .",

    "before we look at the results , we should first comment on the relation between the quasiparticle occupation number and the atomic fluctuation number @xmath214 . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : excspect ] , quasiparticle modes come in three types and the most relevant ones are the hybridized atom - light modes which have the strongest atom - light coupling and tend to lie lowest in the spectrum . since the hybridized modes contain both atomic and light components , their occupation number is not exactly equal to the atomic fluctuation occupation number .",

    "thus , the mode occupation of the oscillators in appendix [ app : shotnoise ] can be roughly mapped to the quasiparticle occupation numbers here .    in order to understand the occupation number dynamics ,",

    "during the course of bloch oscillations these avoided crossings are repeatedly traversed at the bloch frequency and consequently the occupation number dynamics at the avoided crossings are increasingly non - adiabatic as we go up in the spectrum due to landau - zener transitions .",

    "[ fig : qpbandcrosscoup1 ] at @xmath318 the green ( dot - dashed ) curve of the third band approaches the blue ( dashed ) curve of the second band and as a result the populations of the two levels are almost completely exchanged as can be seen at the corresponding time in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpnumbcoup1 ] .",

    "then the last term in above equation gives a correlation between the langevin operators at some future time @xmath89 and the system fluctuation operators at @xmath331 .",
    "due to the delta - correlated nature of the langevin noise this term will be zero .",
