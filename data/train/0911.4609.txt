    "however goes beyond the scope of these proceedings .",
    "the dynamics of prompt photon production in the final state is rather complex because of the very nature of the photon .",
    "schematically , prompt photons can be produced either _ directly _ or by _",
    "fragmentation_. on the one hand , direct photons participate in the short - distance dynamics of the hard subprocess and behave like colorless hard partons . as a consequence , they are produced together with no ( or little ) hadronic activity in their vicinity .",
    "as discussed later , this process may be used to determine the kinematics of the hard qcd process , at least to some extent , thereby allowing one to get constraints on either parton densities or fragmentation functions . on the other hand , fragmentation photons",
    "are produced on long time - scales by the collinear fragmentation of hard partons , in a way similar to that of large-@xmath5 hadrons .",
    "experimentally , fragmentation photons are likely produced inside a hadronic jet . technically , the time - like cascade of a parton @xmath6 eventually producing a photon yields collinear singularities which are absorbed into the fragmentation function of the parton @xmath6 into photons , @xmath7 .",
    "fragmentation functions are defined in a given factorization scheme ( often @xmath8 in practice ) and depend on the arbitrary scale , @xmath9 , taken to be @xmath10 in order to minimize large logarithms .",
    "note that unlike the ff into hadrons , @xmath7 obey _ inhomogeneous _ dglap equations because of the point - like coupling to quarks . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", fragmentation functions are obtained from a fit to @xmath4 data  @xcite .",
    "although useful , one should however keep in mind that the distinction between direct and fragmentation photons becomes meaningless beyond the born level , since the fragmentation channel can be seen as a higher - order direct process ( and vice - versa ) depending on the value of the arbitrary fragmentation scale .",
    "consequently , only the sum of these contributions is physical and depends much less on @xmath9 than the individual unphysical dynamical components .",

    "this _ resolved _ photon component thus leads to the concept of parton distribution functions in the photon , which can be extracted from experimental measurements just like in the proton case ; see  @xcite for a review and  @xcite for a recent nlo analysis of @xmath4 data .",

    "it is certainly desirable to increase the precision of the pdf in the proton ; in the case of nuclear pdf ( npdf ) this turns into an absolutely crucial requirement given the presently huge uncertainties , especially in the gluon sector at small values of @xmath36 ( see e.g. fig .  12 of  @xcite ) . as a consequence , the current precision level for perturbative qcd cross sections in nuclear collisions ( @xmath1a or a ",
    "a ) is rather poor and way below the current state - of - the - art achieved in @xmath1@xmath1  collisions .",
    "this is problematic since important signatures for quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation , such as jet quenching , require a precise knowledge of `` baseline '' nlo predictions in a  a  collisions , independently of any medium effects .",
    "although single photon production does not entirely fix the kinematics of the underlying partonic process even at leading order , it was shown in the nlo analysis  @xcite that the nuclear production ratio , @xmath46 of isolated photons in @xmath1a  collisions at forward rapidity can be used as good approximation of @xmath47 used in the calculation .",
    "provided that the systematic errors are under control , the future measurements of forward photons in @xmath48au collisions at rhic should bring important constraints on npdf prior to the start of heavy - ion collisions at the lhc , thus clarifying the effects of the medium on hard processes .",
