    "photons emitted by hitherto undetected massive stars or miniquasars formed within early galaxies are generally thought to be the reionization source .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical expectation in cosmological models like the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , in which the first objects to condense out of the background and possibly begin star formation were small , of subgalactic mass ( i.e. @xmath7 ) and began to form as early as @xmath8 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the initial collapse of such objects only led to star formation if radiative cooling was possible after collapse , usually involving @xmath9 molecules , and it is likely that the first objects to form stars released radiation ( and possibly sn explosion energy as well ) which exerted a strong feedback on the subsequent formation history of other objects .",
    "the details of this feedback and even the overall _ sign _ ( i.e. negative or positive ) are poorly understood ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that the first stars would have photodissociated @xmath9 long before enough uv was emitted to bring about reionization , so it is currently thought that if reionization was accomplished by stars , they formed in objects with virial temperature @xmath10 , of mass @xmath11 , which were able to cool by atomic radiative cooling , even without @xmath9 .",

    "* ionization fronts in a clumpy universe .",
    "* the neutral , opaque igm out of which the first bound objects condensed was dramatically reheated and reionized at some time between a redshift @xmath16 and @xmath0 by the radiation released by some of these objects . when the first sources turned on , they ionized their surroundings by propagating weak , r - type ionization fronts which moved outward supersonically with respect to both the neutral gas ahead of and the ionized gas behind the front , racing ahead of the hydrodynamical response of the igm @xcite .",
    "the problem of the time - varying radius of a spherical i - front which surrounds isolated sources in a cosmologically - expanding igm was solved analytically by @xcite , taking proper account of the i - front jump condition generalized to cosmological conditions .",
    "they applied these solutions to determine when and how fast these i - front - bounded spheres would grow to overlap and , thereby , complete the reionization of the universe .",
    "the effect of density inhomogeneity on the rate of i - front propagation was described by a mean `` clumping factor ''",
    "@xmath17 , which slowed the i - fronts by increasing the average recombination rate per h atom inside clumps .",
    "this suffices to describe the average rate of i - front propagation as long as the clumps are either not self - shielding or , if so , only absorb a fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by the central source . in two recent calculations ,",
    "this analytical prescription was adapted to n - body simulations of structure formation in the cdm model , to calculate the evolving size of the spherical h  ii regions with which to surround putative sources of ionizing radiation , to model the growth of the ionized volume filling factor leading to reionization @xcite .",
    "numerical radiative transfer methods are currently under development to solve this problem in 3d for the inhomogeneous density distribution which arises as cosmic structure forms , but so far are limited to an imposed density field without gas dynamics ( e.g. @xcite ) . a different approach , which replaces radiative transfer with a `` local optical depth approximation , '' intended to mimic the average rate at which i - fronts expanded and overlapped during reionization within the context of cosmological gas dynamics simulation ,",
    "has also been developed @xcite .",
    "these recent attempts to model inhomogeneous reionization numerically are handicapped by their limited spatial resolution ( @xmath18 ) , which prevents them from resolving the most important density inhomogeneities",
    ". the dynamical response of density inhomogeneities to the i - fronts which encountered them and the effect which these inhomogeneities had , in turn , on the progress of universal reionization , therefore , require further analysis . toward this end",
    ", we have developed a radiation - hydrodynamics code which incorporates radiative transfer and have focused our attention on properly resolving this small - scale structure . in what follows ,",
    "we summarize the results of new radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of what happens when a cosmological i - front overtakes a gravitationally - bound density inhomogeneity  a dwarf galaxy minihalo  during reionization . according to @xcite ,",
    "the photoevaporation of these sub - kpc - sized objects is likely to be the dominant process by which ionizing photons were absorbed during reionization , so this problem is of critical importance in determining how reionization proceeded .",
    "* dwarf galaxy minihalos at high redshift .",
    "* the effect which small - scale clumpiness had on reionization depended upon the sizes , densities , and spatial distribution of the clumps overtaken by the i - fronts during reionization .",
    "for the currently - favored @xmath1cdm model @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , primordial power spectrum index @xmath22 ; cobe - normalized ) , the universe at @xmath23 was already filled with dwarf galaxies capable of trapping a piece of the global , intergalactic i - fronts which reionized the universe and photoevaporating their gaseous baryons back into the igm ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "prior to their encounter with these i - fronts,``minihalos '' with @xmath24 were neutral and optically thick to hydrogen ionizing radiation , as long as their total mass exceeded the jeans mass @xmath25 in the unperturbed background igm prior to reionization [ i.e. @xmath26 , as was required to enable baryons to collapse into the halo along with dark matter .",
    "their `` strmgren numbers '' @xmath27 , the ratio of a halo s diameter to its strmgren length @xmath28 inside the halo ( the length of a column of gas within which the unshielded arrival rate of ionizing photons just balances the total recombination rate ) , were large . for a uniform gas of h density @xmath29 , located a distance @xmath30 ( in mpc ) from a uv source emmitting @xmath31 ionizing photons ( in units of @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the strmgren length is only @xmath33 , so @xmath34 for a wide range of halo masses and sources of interest . in that case , the intergalactic , weak , r - type i - front which entered each minihalo during reionization would have decelerated to about twice the sound speed of the ionized gas before it could exit the other side , thereby transforming itself into a d - type front , preceded by a shock .",
    "typically , the side facing the source would then have expelled a supersonic wind backwards toward the source , which shocked the surrounding igm as the minihalo photoevaporated .",
    "the importance of this photoevaporation process has long been recognized in the study of interstellar clouds exposed to ionizing starlight ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the cosmological context",
    ", however , its importance has only recently been fully appreciated .    in proposing the expanding minihalo model to explain ly@xmath4 forest ( `` lf '' ) quasar absorption lines ,",
    "@xcite discussed how gas originally confined by the gravity of dark - matter minihalos in the cdm model would have been expelled by pressure forces if photoionization by ionizing background radiation suddenly heated all the gas to an isothermal condition at @xmath35 , a correct description only in the optically thin limit .",
    "the first discussion of the photoevaporation of a primordial density inhomogeneity overtaken by a cosmological i - front , including radiation - hydrodynamical simulations , however , was in @xcite .",
    "@xcite subsequently estimated the relative importance of this process for dwarf galaxy minihalos of different masses at different epochs in the cdm model , concluding that 50%90% of the gas which had already collapsed into gravitationally bound objects when reionization occurred should have been photoevaporated .",
    "not only did this photoevaporation during reionization affect most of the collapsed baryons , but so common were minihalos with @xmath36 during reionization that the typical reionizing photon is likely to have encountered one of them , according to @xcite .",
    "a catalogue of all halos in a cubic volume 100 kpc ( 50 kpc ) on a side at @xmath37 in the currently - favored @xmath1cdm model based on n - body simulations reveals that minihalos with @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) were separated on average by only @xmath39 ( 3.5 kpc ) for @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , respectively , while their geometric cross sections together covered @xmath42 ( 30% ) of the area along every 100 kpc of an average line of sight @xcite [ see figs .",
    "1(b ) , ( c ) ] .",
    "if the sources of reionization , on the other hand , were larger - mass halos with @xmath43 [ like those in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , then these were well - enough separated that typical reionization photons were likely to have been absorbed by intervening photoevaporating minihalos . to demonstrate this in a statistically meaningful way with more dynamic range than the n - body results",
    "can yet provide , an analytical approximation to the detailed numerical results is required .",
    "we shall combine the well - known press - schechter ( ps ) prescription for deriving the average number density of halos of different mass at each epoch with the nonsingular truncated isothermal sphere ( tis ) model of @xcite for the size , density profile , and temperature of each halo as unique functions of the halo mass and collapse redshift for a given background universe .",
    "( the tis model and further tests and applications of it are briefly mentioned elsewhere in this volume @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate the validity of these aproximations in figure  2 by comparing them with the n - body simulation results depicted in figure  1 .",
    "the ps halo mass functions plotted in figure  2(a ) are shown in figure  2(b ) to reproduce the n - body results over a range of @xmath44 in halo mass , for which @xmath45 ( proper units ) at @xmath37 .",
    "likewise , figure  2(c ) shows that the tis model correctly predicts the average virial ratio , @xmath46_{\\rm tis}=2.176 $ ] , for halos of different mass according to the n - body results , over this same mass range .",
    "this tis+ps approximation allows us to determine which halo masses are subject to photoevaporation and how common they are , as functions of redshift .",
    "each minihalo with @xmath47 is opaque to h - ionizing photons with a geometric cross section @xmath48 , where @xmath49^{-1}(\\omega_0h^2/0.15)^{-1/3}$ ] .",
    "ionizing photons travelling through this universe will suffer absorption by these minihalos [ i.e. those with mass @xmath50 at each @xmath51 with a mean free path @xmath52 , as shown in figure  3(a ) .",
    "for comparison , the mean separation @xmath53 of halos of each mass is plotted in figure  3(b ) . at @xmath37 , for example , @xmath54 , while halos of mass @xmath55 are separated on average by @xmath56 .",
    "as shown in figure  3(c ) , their ratio , @xmath57 , gives the fraction of the sky , as seen by a source halo of a given mass , which is covered by opaque minihalos located within the mean volume per source halo .",
    "if halos with @xmath55 are the reionization sources , their minihalo covering fraction is close to unity and increases with increasing source mass .",
    "this estimate will increase by a factor of a few if we take account of the statistical bias by which minihalos tend to cluster around the source halos @xcite .",
    "an argument like this led @xcite to argue that our photoevaporating minihalos are the chief consumers of the ionizing photons responsible for reionization . as a result",
    ", they suggest , the photoevaporation of these minihalos drives the number of ionizing photons per baryon required to reionize the universe up by an order of magnitude compared to previous estimates !",
    "a recent semi - analytical study of inhomogeneous reionization by @xcite , which neglected this effect , concluded that only one ionizing photon per hydrogen atom would have been sufficient to reionize most of the volume of the igm by @xmath58 , an order of magnitude too low when compared to the new photoevaporation - dominated estimates .",
    "the gas clumping model they adopted apparently missed the smallest scales because it was adjusted to match numerical simulation results which could not resolve these scales .",
    "simulations by @xcite , which agreed with @xcite , have the same problem since their resolution limit exceeded @xmath59 , too large to resolve the minihalos which photoevaporate .    _ we are led to conclude that further study of the photoevaporation of cosmological minihalos during reionization is essential if we are to advance the theory of reionization . _",
    "the new `` photoevaporation - dominated '' reionization scenario suggests that significantly more than one photon per baryon may have been required , and this is difficult to understand on the basis of simple extrapolation ( e.g. @xcite ) of either quasar or stellar photon production rates observed at @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "perhaps this problem will be alleviated by appeal to the recently revised stellar output for zero metallicity stars @xcite , or to a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons from their source than the nominal @xmath62 typically assumed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , if minihalo sources , alone , reionized the igm ( e.g. with miniquasars instead of starlight ) , then their ionizing photons could have done so without encountering any other minihalos , since @xmath63 for halos with @xmath24 .",
    "photons released , thereafter , would have encountered fewer opaque minihalos , as well , since baryons would not then have condensed out of a reheated igm to form _ new _ minihalos , according to @xcite .",
    "the good news is that observations should be able to distinguish these possibilities . in order for photoevaporating minihalos to have consumed most of the ionizing photons produced before reionization is complete ,",
    "the covering fraction of the ionization sources by these photoevaporative flows must be of order unity . hence",
    ", if we can observe the sources of universal reionization directly , we will generally be able to observe foreground photoevaporating minihalos in absorption toward these sources .",
    "such observations will constrain and help diagnose the reionization process . as shown in figure  4 , photons emitted by _ any _ high @xmath64 source before or during reionization will typically encounter large numbers of photoevaporating minihalos at @xmath23 .",
    "the number of minihalos probed per unit redshift interval , in fact , is just @xmath65 times the ratio of the horizon size @xmath66 at @xmath64 to @xmath52 , a large number .",
    "it is important , therefore , for us to predict the effect which reionization will have on the gas in these minihalos .      *",
    "the photoevaporation of dwarf galaxy minihalos overtaken by cosmological ionization fronts .",
    "* we have performed radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of the photoevaporation of a cosmological minihalo overrun by a weak , r - type i - front in the surrounding igm , created by an external source of ionizing radiation @xcite .",
    "the gas contained h , he , and a possible heavy element abundance of @xmath67 times solar . our simulations in 2d , axisymmetry used an eulerian hydro code with adaptive mesh refinement and the van  leer flux - splitting algorithm , which solved nonequilibrium ionization rate equations ( for h , he , c , n , o , ne , and s ) and included an explicit treatment of radiative transfer by taking into account the bound - free opacity of h and he @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for earlier results which considered uniform clouds and demonstrated the importance of a proper treatment of optical depth .",
    "here we compare some of our results of minihalo photoevaporation in a @xmath1cdm universe @xcite for two types of source spectra : a quasar - like source with emission spectrum @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) and a stellar source with a 50,000 k blackbody spectrum , with luminosity and distance adjusted to keep the ionizing photon fluxes the same in the two cases .",
    "in particular , if @xmath30 is the proper distance ( in mpc ) between source and minihalo and @xmath70 is the h - ionizing photon luminosity ( in units of @xmath71 ) , then the flux at the location of the minihalo would , if unattenuated , correspond initially to @xmath72 ; thereafter , @xmath73 , the cosmic scale factor .",
    "our initial condition before ionization is that of a @xmath74 minihalo in the @xmath1cdm universe which collapsed out and virialized at @xmath75 , yielding a truncated , nonsingular isothermal sphere ( `` tis '' ) of radius @xmath76 in hydrostatic equilibrium with @xmath77 and dark - matter velocity dispersion @xmath78 .",
    "the tis profile has a central density and an average density which are 18,000 and 130 times the mean background density , respectively , with core radius @xmath79 .",
    "this hydrostatic sphere is embedded in a self - similar , spherical , cosmological infall according to @xcite .",
    "the results of our simulations on an @xmath80-grid with @xmath81 cells are illustrated by figures  59 .",
    "the minihalo shields itself against ionizing photons , traps the r - type i - front which enters the halo , causing it to decelerate inside the halo to close to the sound speed of the ionized gas and transform itself into a d - type front , preceded by a shock .",
    "the side facing the source expels a supersonic wind backwards towards the source , which shocks the igm outside the minihalo .",
    "the wind grows more isotropic with time as the remaining neutral halo material is photoevaporated . since this gas was initially bound to a dark halo with @xmath82 , photoevaporation proceeds unimpeded by gravity .",
    "figures  5 and 6 show the structure of the photoevaporative flow 60  myrs after the global i - front first overtakes the minihalo , with key features of the flow indicated by the labels on the temperature plot in figure  6 .",
    "figure  7(a ) shows how the neutral mass of the gas initially within the original hydrostatic sphere gradually declines as the minihalo photoevaporates , within @xmath83 ( 100 )  myrs for the stellar ( quasar ) cases , respectively .",
    "the gradual decay of the opaque cross section of the minihalo as seen by the source is illustrated by figure  7(b ) .",
    "some observational signatures of this process are shown in figures  8 and  9 .",
    "figure  8 shows the spatial variation of the relative abundances of c , n , and o ions along the symmetry axis after 60  myrs . while the quasar case shows the presence at 60  myrs of low as well as high ionization stages for the metals , the softer spectrum of the stellar case yields less highly ionized gas on the ionized side of the i - front ( e.g. mostly c  iii , n  iii , o  iii ) and the neutral side as well ( e.g. c  ii ,",

    ", the stellar case has @xmath91 shifted by 10 s of @xmath92 to the red of the h  i peak , while for the quasar case , he  ii simply follows the h  i profile , except that @xmath93 in the red wing but @xmath94 in the central h  i feature .",
    "after 260 ( 160 )  myr , however , only a lf - like h  i feature with column density @xmath95 remains , with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98/[c]_\\odot$ ] for the stellar ( quasar ) cases , respectively .",
    "as described above , intervening minihalos like these are expected to be ubiquitous along the line of sight to high redshift sources . with photoevaporation times",

    "these simulations show that photoevaporation of a @xmath74 minihalo which begins at @xmath101 can take 250 myr to finish , at @xmath102 , during which time such minihalos can survive without merging into larger halos .",
    "observations of the absorption spectra of high redshift sources like those which reionized the universe should reveal the presence of these photoevaporative flows and provide a useful diagnostic of the reionization process .    * dwarf galaxy suppression and reionization . * as emphasized by @xcite , the reheating of the igm which accompanied its reionization must have filtered the linear growth of baryonic fluctuations in the igm , thereby reducing the baryon collapsed fraction and preventing baryons from condensing out further into the minihalos ( see also @xcite ) . a related effect , the suppression of baryon accretion onto dark matter halos , has also been studied , by 1d @xcite and 3d simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the current conclusion is expressed in terms of the threshold circular velocity , @xmath103 , below which baryonic infall and star formation were suppressed by photoionization : @xmath104 for complete suppression , partial suppression of infall found to extend even to @xmath105 .",
