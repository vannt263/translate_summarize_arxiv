    "nowadays , many different mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics exist , among which the ones suggested by e.  schrdinger @xcite , e.  wigner @xcite , r.  feynman @xcite , l.v .",
    "keldysh @xcite , k.  husimi @xcite , d.  bohm @xcite , @xcite are the most popular ones . while , at a first glance they seem to be drastically different theories , it can be shown that they are all mathematically equivalent . as a matter of fact , they offer the same set of predictions and can be seen as complementary points of view .",
    "the situation is not any different than what one observes in classical mechanics where different formalisms , such as newtonian , lagrangian , hamiltonian , etc .",
    ", coexist and shed different light on different mechanical aspects .    in this paper , we introduce a new formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of signed classical field - less particles .",
    "this suggested theory is based on a generalization and a novel physical interpretation of the mathematical wigner monte carlo method @xcite which is able to simulate the time - dependent _ single_- and _ many_-body wigner equation @xcite , @xcite in a quite intuitive fashion , which experimentalists are familiar with .",
    "indeed it describes quantum objects in terms of classical particles only .",
    "one should notice that the signed particle formulation is equivalent to the usual formulations .",
    "as such , no fundamental new results are introduced .",
    "the predictions made are the same as the ones made in the more standard theory . however , _",
    "`` there is a pleasure in recognizing old things from a new point of view '' _ @xcite and the author hopes it can offer a new perspective on the puzzling quantum nature of the microscopic world . the new theory is based on classical particles which have a position and momentum simultaneously although the heisenberg principle of uncertainty is still respected in the formulation and embedded in terms of unknown initial conditions . in particular , we will show that the sign of a particle can not be evaluated experimentally and no physical measurement can be depicted to find differences with other formalisms .",
    "nevertheless , it offers some noticeable advantages . on the one hand",
    "it is a very intuitive approach which provides a new way to describe nature at a quantum level . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a computationally attractive formulation being based on independently evolving particles , allowing deep levels of parallelization in the time - dependent simulation of quantum single- and many - body systems .",
    "finally , it allows the inclusion of physical effects which are difficult to treat in other formulations of quantum mechanics .    in this paper",
    ", we first introduce the three postulates which completely define the new mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of signed particles .",
    "we then proceed with showing that these three postulates are enough to replicate the results of more conventional quantum theories .",
    "in particular we show that our suggested approach is a natural generalization of the wigner monte carlo method which reconstructs the time - dependent wigner quasi - distribution function and , thus , the corresponding schrdinger wave - function .",
    "afterwards , its classical limit is considered in several details . in order to show the applicability of the proposed theory",
    ", we numerically simulate several experiments involving quantum tunnelling .",
    "to conclude , we extend the theory to include general relativity in the formalism by generalizing the second postulate to the case of particles travelling along space - time geodesics , and we show that typical relativistic effects are observable for quantum wave - packets .",
    "we now introduce the signed particle formulation of quantum mechanics by enunciating , and discussing , the three postulates which completely define the new theory .    _",
    "* postulate i. * physical systems can be described by means of ( virtual ) newtonian particles , i.e. provided with a position @xmath0 and a momentum @xmath1 simultaneously , which carry a sign which can be positive or negative . _",
    "_ * postulate ii . *",
    "a signed particle , evolving in a potential @xmath2 , behaves as a field - less classical point - particle which , during the time interval @xmath3 , creates a new pair of signed particles with a probability @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the positive part of the quantity @xmath7 , \\label{wigner - kernel}\\ ] ] known as the wigner kernel ( in a @xmath8-dimensional space ) @xcite .",
    "if , at the moment of creation , the parent particle has sign @xmath9 , position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 , the new particles are both located in @xmath0 , have signs @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , with @xmath14 chosen randomly according to the ( normalized ) probability @xmath15 . _",
    "_ * postulate iii . * two particles with opposite sign and same phase - space coordinates @xmath16",
    "annihilate . _",
    "we will show that this set of three postulates is sufficient to reconstruct the time - dependent quasi - distribution function of a system and , consequentely , its wave - function .",
    "in other words , the time - dependent evolution of a quantum system can be _ completely _ expressed in terms of creation and annihilation of signed particles only .",
    "some comments on the interpretation and application of the postulates follow below .",
    "_ momentum integral_. it is important to note that the definition of the function @xmath17 is introduced in a continuum phase - space which , in turn , introduces a non - riemann integral ( [ momentum_integral ] ) .",
    "this integral is , in the spirit , very similar to a path integral and the author proposes to name it a _ momentum _ integral .",
    "in fact , while a path integral is spanning the space of trajectories , the integral ( [ momentum_integral ] ) similarly spans the space of momenta .",
    "of course , this new definition is rather elementary and necessitates more mathematical investigations as it may not always imply convergence .    _ particles with a sign_.",
    "the concept of signed particles was suggested for the first time in @xcite to explain the emergence of negative peaks in the wigner quasi - distribution of particular quantum systems ( and the reader should note that it was introduced , strictly speaking , as a _",
    "tool ) . consecutively , this concept has been applied with success to the numerical simulation of a challenging quantum benchmark test involving the evolution of @xmath18functions @xcite .",
    "thus , we borrow this notion to enunciate the first postulate .",
    "in particular , positive and negative particles can be interpreted as usual classical field - less particles moving on newtonian trajectories , but it is impossible to experimentally know simultaneously their position and momentum due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle , thus denying the chance of calculating their trajectory ( and one can only start from a distribution of particles in practical calculations ) . the physical interpretation of the negative sign is suggested below based on experimental evidences coming from the field of quantum tomography @xcite , @xcite , a set of techniques to reconstruct the wigner function of a given experimental setting .    _",
    "negatively signed particles_. in practice , an experiment is prepared in specific initial conditions and repeated a large amount of times ( quantum systems have different outcomes every time ) , providing a projection of the corresponding quasi - distribution on the spatial coordinate axis and momentum axis , and by applying the inverse radon transformation one reconstructs a higher dimensional function which is the wigner function of the system ( with positive and negative values ) .",
    "now , classical objects are always localized in a precise point of the phase - space ( represented by @xmath18functions ) , while for quantum objects the presence of the heisenberg principle of uncertainty prevents such localization , forcing the description of the dynamics to an area of the phase - space bigger than @xmath19 .",
    "this is clearly exhibited by the appearance of negative values in the wigner function and , therefore , one may infer that particles with a negative sign are essentially those which are experimentally unreachable @xcite .",
    "_ physical picture_. consequently , the picture that this novel theory offers is rather peculiar and different than any other mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "quantum systems are now described by means of ensembles of newtonian field - less particles which now carry a sign and interact with an external potential by means of creation and annihilation events only .",
    "when a pair of particles is created , one is in an experimentally reachable state ( positive sign ) , and the other in a non - reachable one ( negative sign ) .",
    "this offers a physical picture which is relatively easy to grasp and which allows the inclusion of quite complex effects in a natural way ( as it will be shown below ) .",
    "_ practical implementation of the formulation_. in particular , given a signed particle at time @xmath20 with sign @xmath9 , mass @xmath21 , and ( phase - space ) coordinates @xmath16 , indicated from now on by @xmath22 , we introduce the operator @xmath23 which constructs a new set of _ three _ signed particles @xmath24 = \\left\\ { \\left ( s , m ; { \\bf{x}}_1 , { \\bf{p}}_1 \\right ) , \\left ( + s , m ; { \\bf{x}}_2 , { \\bf{p}}_2 \\right ) , \\left ( -s , m ; { \\bf{x}}_3 , { \\bf{p}}_3 \\right ) \\right\\}\\ ] ] in the following way :    * at time @xmath20 , one generates a random number @xmath25 $ ] and computes the quantity @xmath26 , * at time @xmath27 , the initial particle evolves as field - less and has new coordinates @xmath28 , * a pair of new signed particles is created at time @xmath27 , where the particle with the sign @xmath9 has coordinates @xmath29 and the particle @xmath11 has coordinates @xmath30 and the quantity @xmath14 is computed from the normalized probability @xmath31 .",
    "the reason for generating a random number @xmath32 is easily explained .",
    "the probability that a signed particle , in a small interval @xmath3 , generates a new pair of particles is @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , the probability that a particle which has generated a new signed pair at time @xmath34 has not yet generated another new pair at time @xmath20 is @xmath35 or , in other words , the probability that no creation occurs during the interval @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath37 that a particle will generate a new pair during the interval @xmath3 is given by @xmath38 due to the complexity of evaluating the integral in the exponent , we thus utilize the numerical technique developed in the context of the boltzmann monte carlo method for phonon scattering events @xcite , which consists of generating a random number @xmath32 in the way described above to find when a ( creation ) event happens .",
    "in practical calculations , one starts from an ensemble of particles distributed in the phase - space according to some specified initial quasi - distribution function , which may be obtained , for example , from a particular wave - function or density matrix describing the initial conditions of the experiment ( but not restricted to these mathematical objects only ) .",
    "it is trivial to generalize the operator @xmath23 to act on a set of @xmath39 signed particles ( with @xmath39 an arbitrary natural number ) by applying the above algorithm to every single particle in the given set .",
    "furthermore , if a time interval @xmath40 $ ] is provided , the operator @xmath23 can be applied repeatedly to every particle appearing in the creation process until the final time @xmath41 is reached .",
    "the final set of particles is , therefore , constituted of every particle involved in the process described above .",
    "it is also important to mention that practical use of the third postulate makes sense only when the time and phase - space are discretized and two signed particles annihilate when they belong to the same cell and have opposite signs at the same time step .",
    "thus , for computational purposes involving the postulates ii and iii , discretized time and phase - space have to be introduced ( although this does not preclude the possibility of an analytical / theoretical treatment on a _ continuum _ phase - space in certain circumstances ) .    for the sake of clarity , a schematic of the algorithm",
    "is presented below ( the reader is also encouraged to download the working source code from @xcite ) .    .... 1 .",
    "start from an initial ensemble of signed particles 2 .",
    "compute the wigner kernel 3 .",
    "compute the gamma function 4 .     for time from 0 to final time 5 .         for every particle of the ensemble 6 .",
    "compute free flight 7 .",
    "( eventually ) create new pairs of signed particles 8 .",
    "end for 9 .",
    "annihilation 10 .",
    "end for ....    in particular , row @xmath42 is equivalent to assigning initial conditions to the system , row @xmath43 is based on formula ( [ wigner - kernel ] ) - eventually restricted to a finite and discrete domain - , row @xmath44 is obtained by means of ( [ momentum_integral ] ) - eventually restricted to a finite and discrete domain - , and , finally , the nested loops starting on row @xmath45 are equivalent to the recursive application of the operator @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the reader should note that row @xmath46 suggests the application of an annihilation step .",
    "this is a very important point as , in certain situations , the number of signed particles may increase indefinitely if no annihilation scheme is applied ( therefore corrupting the validity of the solution ) . when exactly to apply this technique during the simulation remains an open question which will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "_ on macroscopic variables_. the signed particle formulation makes predictions by averaging a macroscopic variable @xmath47 over an initial set of particles , taking into account their sign , i.e. @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the sign , the position and the momentum , respectively , of the @xmath52-th particle . some well - known examples of macroscopic variable are @xmath53 which corresponds to the probability density , @xmath54 which corresponds to the kinetic energy , etc .",
    "this is similar to what is done in classical statistical mechanics within the context of the boltzmann monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "given a function @xmath47 , formula ( [ macroscopic - value ] ) represents the _ only _ meaningful way to make predictions in this theory and which can be compared to experimental measurements .",
    "finally , one should note that the sum in ( [ macroscopic - value ] ) runs over the whole set of @xmath39 particles .",
    "any other use involving subsets of _ signed _ particles is not allowed in the theory .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this section we explore the classical limit of our suggested formulation for @xmath55 . to this aim , we distinguish between two cases : dynamics in free space and dynamics in the presence of an external potential .",
    "this distinction allows a natural and simple way to investigate how the signed particle theory can re - obtain the newtonian theory .",
    "although many assumptions are made in this section , we obtain an important point : signed particle creation is prohibited in the classical limit .    _",
    "free space_. in the case of free space ( absence of any external potential ) , and in the classical limit @xmath55 , the heinsenberg principle does not represent a restriction any longer .",
    "therefore , it is possible to start from an initial distribution function for the signed particles which has the shape of a dirac @xmath18function ( in other words , one particle with a given position and momentum ) .",
    "furthermore , in the classical limit , particles have always a positive sign as it is well - known that classical distribution functions are positive definite . in this context , thus , a signed particle behaves as a classical newtonian ( field - less ) particle as expected and the classical limit is trivially obtained .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the absence of any external potential the function @xmath56 is identically zero or , in other words , there is no creation of particles .",
    "_ external potential_. we now discuss the case in the presence of a non - identically - zero external potential @xmath57 in the classical limit @xmath55 . for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the one - dimensional case , as the extension to the three - dimensional space is trivial .",
    "one starts by noting that given a potential , and having calculated the function @xmath58 from it , the probability for a ( positively signed ) particle to stay in a given path @xmath59 , during the time interval @xmath60 $ ] , is @xmath61 now , one can show that the wigner kernel ( [ wigner - kernel ] ) reads @xmath62,\\ ] ] under the change of integration variable @xmath63 . by exploiting the fact that the wigner kernel is a real function @xcite and supposing that the potential @xmath57 can be expressed in terms of a mclaurin series , one easily obtains ( by means of trivial algebraic manipulations ) the following expression for the kernel @xmath64 where the summation runs over _",
    "even _ numbers only and @xmath65 is the @xmath66th order derivative of the potential . finally , by neglecting every term down to the second order @xmath67 , and by performing the analytical integration of the only term remaining , one has @xmath68_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\nonumber \\\\            & = & 2 \\lim_{t ' \\rightarrow + \\infty } \\frac{2 v(x)}{\\pi p \\hbar } \\sin(\\frac{p^2 t'}{\\hbar m } ) \\nonumber \\\\            & \\approx & \\frac{4 v(x)}{\\pi p \\hbar } \\sin(\\frac{p^2 t}{\\hbar m } ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( for a big enough time @xmath69 ) which substituted in ( [ momentum_integral ] ) gives the following expression for the function @xmath58 @xmath70^+,\\ ] ] with @xmath71^+$ ] the positive part of the quantity in brackets .",
    "now , supposing that @xmath72 for any position @xmath73 ( the extension to a general potential is trivial ) , the condition for the term in the bracket to be positive reads : @xmath74 which , in the classical limit @xmath55 , becomes @xmath75 or in other words @xmath76 . therefore ( in the classical limit ) the function @xmath77 is identically zero @xmath78 , and creation of pairs of signed particles is prohibited .    finally , concerning the equations of motion for ( positively ) signed particles for @xmath55 , one starts from the fact that the wigner equation reduces to the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the technique utilized in the previous section to obtain the postulates of our formulation must be applied to the vlasov equation . by exploiting the main results of @xcite ( which is an application of the same technique to the boltzmann equation ) one easily recover the newtonian equations .",
    "this completes the study of the classical limit .",
    "tunnelling is a typical quantum effect which can not be explained in terms of classical mechanics .",
    "in fact , it represents one of the foundational experimental evidence for the need of a quantum theory .",
    "in particular , it shows that material particles can tunnel through potential barriers , even when the initial particle energy is classically unsufficient . in this section",
    ", we show that such experimental observation can be reproduced by our suggested formulation of quantum mechanics , thus proving the validity and the applicability of the approach .",
    "two benchmark tests are performed ( similar to the one presented in @xcite ) consisting of an initially gaussian wave - packet with energy equal to @xmath79 ev directed towards a potential barrier equal to @xmath80 ev ( in the first case ) and to @xmath81 ev ( in the second case ) .",
    "the simulation of a free wave - packet is also performed for comparison purposes and shown in fig .",
    "[ distribution_00 ] . in more details",
    ", in the first numerical experiment ( @xmath80 ev ) one expects that part of the wave packet to be reflected back and part of the packet to tunnel through the barrier ( due to its energy slightly smaller than the barrier itself ) . in the second experiment , instead",
    ", a strong reflection is expected due to the high energetic value of the barrier ( @xmath81 ev ) .",
    "every simulation is fully obtained by evolving an initial set of signed particles as prescribed in the three postulates ( introduced above ) and augmented by the equations of motion for a signed particle : @xmath82    the results of these two experiments are reported in figs .",
    "[ distribution_01 ] and [ distribution_03 ] showing the simulation results at times ( from left to right , from top to bottom ) @xmath83 fs , @xmath84 fs , @xmath85 fs , @xmath86 fs , @xmath87 fs , @xmath88 fs , @xmath89 fs and @xmath90fs respectively .",
    "in particular , one notes in both experiments the appearance of negative values during the evolution , a typical sign of the presence of dominant quantum effects ( in other words tunnelling ) . furthermore , it becomes clear that a certain amount of signed particles tunnels through the barrier ( represented schematically by a red line in the middle of the domain ) although this amount varies according to the height of the barrier .",
    "we believe that the fact that quantum tunnelling effects can be reproduced by applying the operator @xmath23 shows the validity and applicability of our suggested formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "an extension to relativistic quantum mechanics can be delineated taking into account the classical nature of the particles involved in the new formulation of quantum mechanics . indeed , when introducing the second postulate , no equation for the trajectory is specified .",
    "the enunciation is very general and expressed only in terms of _ classical field - less particles_. eventually , the equations are specified for the first time in ( [ classical - trajectory ] ) when necessary for implementation purposes , but this is not the only option available .    as a matter of fact",
    ", it is possible to define the trajectories of particles involved in postulate ii as geodesics , allowing the evolution of quantum objects in a curved space - time .",
    "hence , given a metric tensor @xmath91 , describing the geometric structure of space - time , one can substitute eqns .",
    "( [ classical - trajectory ] ) by a relativistic orbit ( geodesics ) : @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath9 is the proper time , @xmath94 are the christoffel symbols ( a function of @xmath91 ) , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( @xmath99 spatial coordinates ) . in particular ,",
    "if the metric tensor describes a flat space - time ( minkowski metric ) , one obtains special relativity .    figs .",
    "[ time_dilation ] and [ induced_dipole ] show the results obtained from the simulation of an initially gaussian wave - packet moving in a flat space - time with no external potential at a speed comparable to the speed of light ( about @xmath100 ) .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ time_dilation ] shows the time dilation computed ( as a macroscopic average over all involved particles , see ( [ macroscopic - value ] ) ) in the non - relativistic ( blue dashed curve ) and relativistic ( red contniuous curve ) cases respectively .",
    "[ induced_dipole ] , instead , displays the ( damped ) induced dipole from which one obtains the energy spectrum of the system through a fourier transform .",
    "it is clear from these pictures how typical relativistic effects , such as time dilation and energy spectrum shift , are essentially captured by the suggested relativistic extension of our quantum theory .",
    "in this paper , a new mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics has been suggested in terms of signed newtonian field - less particles which can be seen as a generalization and physical interpretation of the time - dependent wigner monte carlo method @xcite extended to a non - discretized phase - space and a non - finite domain .",
    "the suggested formulation consists of a set of three postulates which completely describe the time evolution of quantum systems .",
    "the predictions made by this theory are exactly the same as those made by other standard approaches .",
    "in fact , we have shown that simulating a quantum system by repeatedly applying the operator @xmath23 is perfectly equivalent to solve the time - dependent wigner equation and , consequently , the time - dependent schrdinger equation . in order to show the validity and applicability of the suggested formulation",
    ", we have simulated different systems where quantum tunnelling effects are prominent .",
    "finally , we have proposed a relativistic extension of the second postulate in terms of signed particles moving on space - time geodesics and we have shown how typical relativistic effects , such as time dilation and shift of energy spectrum , are predicted correctly .",
    "this particular example underlines how the new formulation provides a novel significantly easy - to - extend quantum theory .",
    "to conlude , one should note that many aspects of this peculiar and new formulation still remain to be explored .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to study how the introduction of a finite time step @xmath101 affects the simulation of a quantum system ( as it may strongly depends on the presence of an external potential ) .",
    "likewise , the frequency of annihilation steps to apply in a simulation remains an open problem which needs to be investigated .",
    "it would be also important to study the mathematical properties ( and in particular the convergence ) of the newly defined _ momentum _ integral ( [ momentum_integral ] ) .",
    "moreover , it would be useful to investigate the relation between this new formulation and others such as the ones proposed by d.  bohm and r.  feynman ( as many similarities can be found already ) .",
    "it is also clear that the classical limit presented in this work may not be entirely satisfactory from a mathematical / theoretical perspective as it introduces several strong assumptions which may need to be investigated in further details .",
    "another interesting point is to apply this method to bigger and more realistic quantum systems occurring in real life applications and see how it performs compared to other more standard approaches",
    ". this will be the topic of next - future papers . despite all these pending questions ,",
    "the signed particle formulation remains a new instrument to explore quantum mechanics , offering a unique and alternative new point of view .",
    "the simulator used to obtain the results presented in this paper is a modified version of archimedes , the gnu package for the simulation of carrier transport in semiconductor devices @xcite .",
    "this code was first released in 2005 , and , since then , users have been able to download the source code under the gnu public license ( gpl ) .",
