    "first principles electronic structure calculations have become an important tool in interpreting stm experiments .",
    "calculations of theoretical stm images are often based on the theory by tersoff and hamann@xcite , which states that the the stm current is proportional to the local density of states(ldos ) of the sample . in this theory",
    "it is assumed that the potential is flat between the tip and the sample , and the vacuum level given by the sample work function .",
    "however , for relatively high biases ( @xmath2  v ) , which are often used in stm experiments on semiconductor surfaces , the electric field strength in the tunnel region can be relatively high and must be included in the theoretical model@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the tersoff - hamann formalism to include the electric field in the tunnel region , and apply the theory to calculate the corrugation of a single missing hydrogen defect on the monohydride si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface .",
    "we find that the corrugation is strongly increased by the electric field , mainly due to polarization effects and partly due to changes in the tunnel barrier .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : in section ii we present the basic theory for calculating field dependent stm images , and in section  iii we show how the electric field effect can be included in the first principles calculation . in section",
    "iv we apply the formalism to calculate the corrugation of a missing hydrogen defect on the monohydrate si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface and in section  v we conclude .",
    "in this section we present the basic theory for calculating field dependent stm images .",
    "the derivation will follow chen@xcite closely .",
    "figure  1 shows the tunnel junction between the tip and sample . using the modified bardeen approach@xcite ,",
    "the tunnel current is given by @xmath3|m_{\\mu \\nu}|^2   \\delta(\\epsilon_{\\mu}-\\epsilon_{\\nu } ) , \\\\",

    ", @xmath5 defines the difference between tip and sample fermi levels , and @xmath6 is the fermi function .",
    "the modified sample(tip ) wave functions @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are solutions to the schrdinger equation with modified sample(tip ) potential @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these potentials are given by the tunnel potential @xmath11 upto the separating surface , @xmath4 , and are equal to the vacuum level beyond the separating surface , thus @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the gradient of @xmath11 in the tunnel region determines the tip induced electric field , @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the tip is grounded and the vacuum level determined by the tip workfunction .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the tunnel current is due to a single atom at the tip apex .",
    "we place the separating surface , @xmath4 , just outside the atomic radius , @xmath15 , of this atom ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the position of the tip we denote by @xmath16 , and the tip sample distance is given by @xmath17 .",
    "since the tip potential equals the vacuum level beyond the separating surface , it is straightforward to expand the modified tip wave functions in real spherical harmonics , @xmath18 , and obtain @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distance from the tip atom , @xmath21 the spherical modified bessel functions , @xmath22 the inverse decay length of the electron states in vacuum , and @xmath23 the fermi level of the sample .",
    "following ref  @xcite we observe that the tip greens function , defined by @xmath24 , is related to the tip wave - function by @xmath25 , where the differential operators @xmath26 are defined in table  1 , and the coefficients @xmath27 defined by @xmath28 .",
    "we now obtain the current @xmath29 where we have neglected coherence between partial tip states and @xmath30 are partial tip density of states per unit volume .",
    "we have calculated @xmath31 for a single w atom on a w(110 ) surface using @xmath32  bohr .",

    "using these values we obtain the current @xmath43 where distances are in bohr , energies in ev and current in amperes .",
    "parameters @xmath44 are defined in table  1 .",
    "the main quantity is the sample ldos , @xmath45 .",
    "the wave functions @xmath7 are calculated in the external electric field from the tip , and we approximate this field by a planar electric field of strength @xmath46 . for a given tip - sample distance @xmath47 , the field strength is determined from the equation @xmath48 where @xmath9 is the effective sample potential in planar field @xmath46 .",
    "this equation assumes that the tip behaves as a metallic sphere of radius @xmath15 , consistent with the spherical potential - well model of the tip used in eq .",
    "( 3)@xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper , eq .  ( 7 ) , is a high voltage generalization of the tersoff - hamann expression@xcite for the stm current .",
    "the main differences between eq .",
    "( 7 ) and the expression by tersoff and hamann are the integration over the electronic states and the calculation of the sample wave functions in an external electric field .",
    "we also include higher angular tip states@xcite , whereas the tersoff - hamann formulation is for an @xmath49-type state only .",
    "for the systems we have investigated we find that @xmath50 terms are more than one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath51 terms and can therefore be neglected . of the @xmath51 states , we find that the @xmath52 state gives a contribution which is twice that of @xmath53 states . in the following",
    "we will only consider the @xmath52 contribution , since we have found that this contribution best describes the experimental images we consider .",
    "however , we note that occasionally we see a change in the image contrast , which might be due to dominance of @xmath53 states for special tip geometries .",

    "the wave functions are obtained by outward integration using the average effective potential perpendicular to the slab@xcite .    in the following",
    "we will consider the monohydrate si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface , which we model by a ( 2@xmath01 ) slab with 12 layers of silicon atoms , and a vacuum region of 10   .",
    "we apply an external electric field to the surface , by inserting a dipole layer in the middle of the vacuum region@xcite .",
    "the effect of mobile carriers is introduced by fixing the atoms on the the back surface of the slab in their bulk positions@xcite .",
    "this gives rise to half - filled surface states in the middle of the band gap , and this surface is therefore metallic . depending on the direction of the external field the surface states accept or donate electrons . to obtain the field dependence of the wave functions we calculate the wave functions for two fields , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , which bound the field range in the experiment .",
    "the wave functions at a given field , @xmath56 , are then obtained by logarithmic interpolation between the wave functions at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "figure  2 shows the effective one - electron potentials for calculations with external fields of @xmath57  v /   and @xmath58  v /  . while the potential on the back surface is the same for both fields , the potential on the monohydrate(front ) surface bends upwards for positive fields and downwards for negative fields , respectively .",

    "2 shows the band bending in the slab calculation compared with the band bending in a n - type sample with @xmath59  cm@xmath39 .",
    "the band bending calculation is based on standard band bending theory with non - degenerate statistics.@xcite for the n - type sample the fermi level is close to the conduction band , and we have the well known depletion and inversion for positive fields . in the case of the slab calculation",
    ", mobile carriers are simulated by the half - filled dangling - bond states on the back surface , and since these states fix the fermi level in the middle of the band gap , the band bending is nearly symmetric in the field .",
    "the experimental fermi level is given by@xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the bandgap , @xmath63 the number of intrinsic carriers and @xmath64 the surface temperature .",
    "to correct for the difference in fermi - level and band bending , @xmath65 , between the experiment and the slab model we shift the stm voltage in the slab model by @xmath66 at positive bias , and @xmath67 at negative bias ( values with tilde are slab quantities ) . in this way",
    "we obtain that the energy window of electronic states which contributes to the current is the same in the slab model as in the experiment .",
    "3 we show a typical stm filled state image of the monohydrate si(100)-h(2@xmath01 ) surface . the bright vertical stripes originate from the hydrogen passivated silicon dimer rows , and the white spot originates from a silicon dangling bond due to a single missing hydrogen defect . below the image",
    "we show the corrugation across the defect(solid line ) , compared with the simulated stm image of an @xmath49-state tip including field effects(dashed line ) and without field effects(dotted line ) . in the range",
    "-5  @xmath6810     the theoretical curves were obtained using a c(4@xmath04 ) cell with a single missing hydrogen defect , and outside this range using a ( 2@xmath01 ) cell .",
    "we see that the corrugation of the defect is well described in the field dependent calculation , while it is less than half the value when the field is not included .",
    "the larger corrugation of the defect in the field dependent calculation is mainly due to polarization of the dangling bond .",
    "away from the defect the corrugation in both calculations is less than in the experiment .",
    "calculations using @xmath69- or @xmath70-state tips do not give better agreement , and we suggest that the larger experimental corrugation away from the defect might be due to thermal vibrations on the surface .",
    "we have presented a high voltage extension of the tersoff - hamann model of stm images , which includes the electric field between tip and sample .",
    "we have applied the model to describe the corrugation of a single missing hydrogen defect , and find good agreement with experiment when field effects are included . at low voltages",
    "@xmath71  v , the field induced change of the corrugation is mainly due to polarization . for higher voltages",
    "@xmath72  v , as used in many atom manipulation experiments , the field also has a pronounced effect on the tunnel barrier , and we hope that the present work may prove useful for the analysis of such experiments ."
