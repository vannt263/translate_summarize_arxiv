    "the connection between cosmic x - ray sources and compact stars is an old one : soon after the discovery of the first such source , sco x-1 ( giacconi et al .",
    "1963 ) , it was proposed that these objects are young hot neutron stars , formed in recent supernovae , which cool through thermal radiation from their surfaces ( chiu 1964 ; chiu & salpeter 1964 ; finzi 1964 ) . however , the finite extent of the x - ray source associated with the crab nebula ( bowyer et al .",
    "1964 ) , and the non - planckian shape of the x - ray spectra of this source ( clark 1965 ) and of sco x-1 ( giacconi et al . 1965 ) showed that this was not , in general , a good model for x - ray sources .",
    "accretion onto a compact star had meanwhile been suggested as a possible source of energy for quasars and x - ray sources ( salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich 1964 ; zeldovich & guseinov 1964 ) , and together with the peculiarities of the optical spectra of the counterparts of sco x-1 ( sandage et al .",
    "1966 ) and cyg x-2 ( giacconi et al . 1967 ) this led to the idea that these sources are mass - exchanging binaries with a compact component ( shklovsky 1967 ; see also burbidge 1972 ; ginzburg 1990 ) .",
    "the spectrum of sco x-1 was similar to those of old novae and u gem type stars , which were by then known to be binary stars , in particular through the work of crawford and kraft in the 1950s and 60s ( crawford & kraft 1956 ; kraft 1962 , 1964 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of cyg x-2 was found to be composite , showing the signatures of both a late - type star and a component of much higher excitation ; cyg x-2 also showed significant radial - velocity variations .",
    "however , the single - most important characteristic of a binary star , i.e. , an orbital periodicity , was not found in either system until many years later , in spite of substantial observational effort ( see hiltner & mook 1970 , and kraft 1973 , for discussions of early optical observations of x - ray sources , and references ) .",
    "the discovery of the first x - ray binary , cyg x-1 , by webster & murdin ( 1972 ) and bolton ( 1972 ) followed the determination of an accurate ( @xmath0 ) error box by rappaport et al .",
    "( 1971 ) , which contained a radio source ( braes & miley 1971 ; hjellming & wade 1971 ) coincident with the 8th magnitude known supergiant hd 226868",
    ". optical spectroscopy of this star revealed a 5.6 day periodic radial - velocity variation with an amplitude @xmath1 km / s , and a corresponding mass function ( see sect .",
    "4.3.1 ) @xmath2  m@xmath3 . under the assumption that the supergiant has a `` normal '' mass of @xmath4  m@xmath3 these results led to the conclusion that the mass of the compact star in cyg x-1 is higher than 3  m@xmath3 , which exceeds the maximum possible mass of a neutron star .",
    "thus , the first x - ray source for which the binary nature was established , contained an accreting object that is likely to be a black hole .",
    "( see section 3.1 for a discussion of the term `` black hole '' in the context of x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the identification of the radio source with cyg x-1 was confirmed when its brightness showed a large increase correlated with a major hardening of the 2 - 10 kev spectrum of cyg x-1 ( tananbaum et al .",
    "we now know that this spectral hardening is caused by the disappearance of an `` ultra - soft '' spectral component in the x - ray spectrum , signalling a transition from a `` high '' ( or `` soft '' ) state to a `` low '' ( or `` hard '' ) state ( see sect .",
    "the idea that all bright galactic x - ray sources are mass - exchanging binary stars with a compact accretor became widely accepted with the observation of regular eclipses of the pulsating x - ray source cen x-3 ( giacconi et al . 1971 ; schreier et al .",
    "the variable delays of the pulse arrival times , in phase with the periodic ( 2.1 days ) eclipses of the x - ray source , showed persuasively that in cen x-3 the x rays are generated by accretion onto a strongly magnetized neutron star , rotating at a 4.8 s pulse period , in orbit around a massive ( @xmath5 10  m@xmath3 ) companion star .",
    "this was later confirmed by the optical identification of this source with an o - type giant star ( krzeminski 1974 ) .",
    "the discovery of the binary nature of cen x-3 was soon followed by more observations of eclipsing x - ray sources , some of them pulsating , and by the identification of these x - ray sources with early - type stars ( see , e.g. , liller 1973 ; penny et al . 1973 ; vidal 1973 ) .",
    "in addition , a general framework for the origin and evolution of a massive x - ray binary , as a rather normal episode in the life of a massive close binary star with successive stages of mass transfer between the two components , was readily accepted ( van den heuvel & heise 1972 ) .",
    "thus , within a few years the existence of a galactic population of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) , with accreting neutron stars ( or occasionally a black hole ) was well established .    already in the 1960 s ( see ,",
    "e.g. , dolan 1970 ) it had become clear that there is a clustering of bright x - ray sources within @xmath6 of the direction of the galactic center .",
    "this concentration was not accompanied by a strong background of unresolved sources , which showed that these sources are located in the central regions of the galaxy ( ryter 1970 ; setti & woltjer 1970 ) .",
    "it was , therefore , suspected that apart from the above - described hmxb there is a class of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) with donor star masses of the order of a solar mass or less ( see , e.g. , salpeter 1973 ) , but proof for this idea was hard to obtain .",
    "apart from the difficulty of finding orbital periods , the apparent heterogeneity of the properties of lmxb may have played a role .",
    "compared to the hmxb the first handful of systems now classified as lmxb ( her x-1 , sco x-1 , cir x-1 ) show rather more diversity than similarity in their properties . as a result , only at the end of the 1970s did it become clear that there are such objects as low - mass x - ray binaries , which form a group with `` family traits '' , distinct from the hmxb with respect to their sky distributions , x - ray spectral characteristics , optical properties , and types of x - ray variability ( see , e.g. , lewin & clark 1980 ) .",
    "the lmxb comprise the globular - cluster x - ray sources , x - ray bursters , soft x - ray transients , and the bright galactic - bulge x - ray sources .",
    "the properties of hmxb and lmxb are discussed in section 2 .",
    "roughly speaking , the reason for the bi - modal distribution of the masses of donor stars in x - ray binaries is that for stars less massive than @xmath7  m@xmath3 the stellar wind is too weak to power a strong x - ray source ; on the other hand , roche lobe overflow is unstable for stars more massive than a neutron star , and proceeds on a very short time scale , as a consequence of which the accreting neutron is completely engulfed and x rays can not escape .    the differences between the x - ray properties of lmxb and hmxb ( with accreting neutron stars ) may be linked to a difference in the strength of the magnetic fields of the neutron stars they harbour .",
    "the natural assumption that the difference in donor star masses corresponds to a difference in the ages of lmxb and hmxb has led to the idea that the magnetic fields of neutron stars decay with time .",
    "this topic is briefly discussed in section 2.6 .    for a relatively small , but increasing , number of x - ray binaries ( both hmxb and lmxb ) there is evidence that the accreting object is a black hole .",
    "this evidence is based on mass determinations of the compact star from the orbital parameters of the x - ray binary . in section 3",
    "i discuss the x - ray properties of accreting black holes , and attempts that have been made to recognize x - ray characteristics that might allow one to `` easily '' identify black holes in x - ray binaries .",
    "an overview of mass determinations of neutron stars and black holes is given in section 4 .",
    "within the limits of this review i can not strive for completeness . for detailed reviews on a variety of topics related to x - ray binaries",
    "i refer the interested reader to the recent book `` x - ray binaries '' ( lewin , van paradijs & van den heuvel 1995 ) .",
    "further background information can be found in individual chapters in the books by shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) , frank , king & raine ( 1992 ) , gelman & van den heuvel ( 1989 ) , ventura & pines ( 1991 ) , van den heuvel & rappaport ( 1992 ) , and alpar , kiziloglu & van paradijs ( 1995 ) .",
    "references on individual sources can be found in bradt & mcclintock ( 1983 ) and van paradijs ( 1995 ) .",
    "an extensive summary of x - ray satellite missions has been given by bradt , ohashi & pounds ( 1992 ) .",
    "the optical counterparts of hmxb have normal early - type spectra , in the sense that these can be mk - classified ( cf .",
    "kaler 1989 ) without particular difficulty , on the basis of ratios of spectral line strengths ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . this is highly informative , since it immediately provides us with at least an approximate idea about the masses , radii , and ages of these stars .",
    "some disturbance of the spectrum , indicative of anisotropic gas flow near the primary may show up as variable emission / absorption components , particularly in h@xmath8 , h@xmath9 , he ii @xmath104686 , and the ciii - niii @xmath104630 - 50 complex .",
    "however , when the latter two lines are strongly in emission ( see e.g. , hensberge 1973 ) this is likely due to a very high temperature and luminosity of the primary ( e.g. , of characteristics ) , and not to the presence of the x - ray source .",
    "except for the strong resonance lines of abundant ions , the same is true for the uv spectra of hmxb .",
    "the reason that the x - ray source does not seem to affect the spectral properties of the primary much , is that the bolometric luminosity of the latter generally exceeds the x - ray luminosity , often by a large margin ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .    with respect to the spectral types of their optical counterparts",
    "the hmxb can be divided into two subgroups , as follows .",
    "( i ) the spectral type is earlier than b2 , and the luminosity class is i to iii , i.e. , the primary star has evolved off the main sequence .",
    "the orbital periods are generally less than @xmath1110 days .",
    "the donor stars fill , or almost fill , their roche lobes , as is apparent from the amplitudes of their optical light curves .",
    "( ii ) the primary is a b - emission ( be ) star , characterized by emission lines ( mainly the balmer series ) which originate in circumstellar material . in the hertzsprung - russell diagram",
    "they lie rather close to the main sequence .",
    "the orbits of these be / x - ray binaries are eccentric , and their periods tend to be long .",
    "the primaries underfill their roche lobes .    as first suggested by maraschi et al .",
    "( 1975 ) the mass transfer in these two groups is driven by different mechanisms . in the first group mass",
    "is transferred via a strong stellar wind ( in some sources a short - lived phase of roche lobe overflow is observed ) . in the be / x - ray binaries the mass transfer is related to the anisotropic ( often highly variable ) shedding of mass in the equatorial plane .",
    "this is observed in all be stars , and is related to their rapid rotation ( slettebak 1987 ; briot 1986 ; bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ) .",
    "this inferred difference in mass transfer mechanism is supported by the different relations between orbital period and x - ray pulse period , first pointed out by corbet ( 1984 ) , for these two groups of sources ( see the contribution by m. finger to this volume ) .",
    "most be / x - ray binaries are highly variable , or transient . in some of them",
    "recurrent outbursts have been observed , which reflect the varying accretion rate onto the neutron star as it moves in its eccentric orbit through regions of varying density around the be star .",
    "in addition , a more sudden turning on and off of the accretion can occur when the wind density becomes too low for the neutron star magnetosphere to be within the corotation radius , so that accretion becomes centrifugally inhibited ( stella 1986 ) .",
    "however , in many cases outbursts have been observed which are not related to the orbit of the be / x - ray binary .",
    "these outbursts are generally believed to be due to a sudden enhancement of the mass loss of the be star ( for reviews of various aspects of be stars see slettebak & snow 1987 , and waters 1989 ) ; however , it has recently been suggested that these outbursts may be caused by instabilities in an accretion disk around the neutron star , analogous to those in dwarf novae and soft x - ray transients ( see m. finger , this volume . )    many hmxb with evolved mass donors show optical brightness variations , with two maxima and two minima per orbital cycle , which occur at quadratures and conjunctions , respectively .",
    "these so - called ellipsoidal variations are caused by the tidal and rotational distortion of the mass donor which fills ( or nearly fills ) its roche lobe , and the non - uniform distribution of its surace brightness ( see sect .",
    "in several cases the light curves are also affected by x - ray heating of the mass donor , and by the presence of an accretion disk ( in lmxb these effects completely dominate the optical light curves ) . generally , in be / x - ray binaries irregular variations , related to their equatorial mass loss , dominate any orbital variability .",
    "for extensive discussions of the optical light curves of hmxb , see tjemkes et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , van paradijs ( 1991 ) and van paradijs & mcclintock ( 1995 ) .",
    "the optical spectra of lmxb ( e.g. , shahbaz et al .",
    "1996a ) show a few emission lines , particularly h@xmath8 , h@xmath9 , heii @xmath104686 , and ciii - niii @xmath104630 - 50 , superposed on a rather flat ( in frequency ) continuum ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . in very few cases",
    "the signature of a companion star can be discerned . according to motch & pakull ( 1989 ) the relative strength of the ciii - niii emission complex relative to the @xmath104686 emission provides a good measure of the heavy - element abundances in the accreted matter .",
    "spectra of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , in which the accretor is not a neutron star ( or black hole ) but a white dwarf , bear a general resemblance to those of lmxb , showing emission lines superposed on a continuum ( see warner 1995 , for a comprehensive review of cvs ) .",
    "however , the equivalent widths of these lines in lmxb spectra , in particular that of h@xmath9 , tend to be much smaller than those in cv spectra ( van paradijs & verbunt 1984 ; shahbaz et al .",
    "1996a ) .    in lmxb the donor star transfers mass by roche lobe overflow .",
    "this mass arrives at the compact star via a relatively flat rotating configuration , the accretion disk , in which it slowly spirals inward .",
    "lmxb spectra originate from this accretion disk , which radiates mainly through reprocessing of incident x - rays into optical / uv photons .",
    "this reprocessing dominates the internal energy generation of the disk due to conversion of gravitational potential energy into heat , generally by a large factor ( see van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) . for internal energy generation alone , as occurs in accretion disks in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , the ( local ) effective temperature , @xmath12 , in the disk varies with radial distance , @xmath13 , from the central compact star approximately as @xmath14 . in lmxb disks , where reprocessing of x rays dominates the energy budget , one would expect @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the farther out in the disk , the more reprocessing dominates internal energy generation .",
    "according to the simplified , but self - consistent calculations of vrtilek et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , in which also the effect of x - ray irradiation on the height of the disk is taken into account , @xmath16 .",
    "many lmxb show a regular orbital variation of their optical brightness , with one maximum and minimum per orbital cycle .",
    "minimum light occurs at the superior conjunction of the x - ray source .",
    "these variations are caused by the changing visibility of the accretion disk and the x - ray heated side of the secondary , insofar as the latter is not in the x - ray shadow of the disk ( see van paradijs 1991 , and van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 , for reviews of the optical light curves of lmxb ) .    for transient lmxb",
    "( `` soft x - ray transients '' , see sect .",
    "3.4 ) in quiescence x - ray heating of the accretion disk and the companion star is not very important , and the optical emission of the system is dominated by the roche lobe filling secondary star .",
    "these systems then show ellipsoidal light curves ( see also sect .",
    "4.3.2 ) .    the ( reddening - corrected ) colour indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 of lmxb have average values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ( errors are @xmath21 standard deviations ) , close to those expected for a flat continuum ( @xmath22 = constant ) .",
    "the distribution of the ratio of x - ray to optical fluxes is rather sharply peaked .",
    "expressed in terms of an `` optical / x - ray colour index '' @xmath23 + 2.5 log @xmath24(@xmath25jy ) , the peak occurs near 21.5 , corresponding to a ratio of fluxes emitted in x rays ( 2 - 11 kev ) and in optical light ( 3000 - 7000  ) of @xmath26 ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "the optical luminosities of lmxbs are , in general , much higher than those of cvs ( see , e.g. , warner 1987 , 1995 ) ; this is because the gravitational potential well of a neutron star is much deeper than that of a white dwarf , and x - ray heating of the accretion disk is not important in cvs .",
    "absolute visual magnitudes @xmath27 have been estimated for lmxb with distance estimates : ( i ) lmxb in stellar systems at a known distance ; ( ii ) x - ray burst sources showing bursts with photospheric radius expansion ; during this phase of expansion the burst luminosity is very close to the eddington limit , which is a reasonably good standard candle ( see lewin , van paradijs & taam 1993 ; 1995 ) . thus , the x - ray luminosity ( in units of the eddington limit ) is given by ratio @xmath28 of the persistent flux to the peak flux of radius expansion bursts ; ( iii ) z sources ( see sect .",
    "2.4.4 ) ; when these are in the `` normal - branch '' state their x - ray luminosity is very close to the eddington limit ( see , e.g. , van der klis 1995 ) ; ( iv ) soft x - ray transients , i.e. , lmxb whose mass accretion rate is high only during rather brief time intervals , and very low during most of the time .",
    "their distance can be determined from the spectral properties of the companion star , which becomes detectable during `` quiescence '' when reprocessing of x rays in the accretion disk is not important .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of active lmxb range between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "this large range is the consequence of the large range in x - ray luminosity , @xmath31 , of the central source , and in the size of the accretion disk . for a simple model of reprocessing of x rays the optical luminosity , @xmath32 , of the disk",
    "is expected to scale with @xmath31 and orbital period p as @xmath33 , in agreement with the values of @xmath27 for lmxb with known orbital periods ( see fig .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical calculations of x - ray heated accretion disks ( de jong et al . 1996 ) .",
    "orbital periods have been determined for 28 hmxb using various methods , e.g. , x - ray eclipse timing , doppler delay curves of x - ray pulse arrival times , and optical brightness and radial - velocity variations ; they range between 4.8 hours and 188 days ( van paradijs 1995 ; see also table 1 ) .",
    "the orbital periods are correlated with the type of mass transfer that powers the x - ray source , and with the evolutionary state of the binary system .",
    "the shortest orbital period by far ( 4.8 hours ) is that of cyg x-3 , whose mass donor is a helium star ( van kerkwijk 1992 , 1996 ) .",
    "this source represents a late stage in the evolution of a `` normal '' x - ray binary , which has passed a common - envelope phase in which the primary has lost its hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "systems with ( incipient ) roche lobe overflow ( e.g. , lmc x-4 , lmc x-3 , cen x-3 ) , tend to have orbital periods of a few days .",
    "( once roche lobe overflow has fully developed the mass tranfer rate will become very large , and the compact star is expected to be completely shrouded and not to be detectable as an x - ray source . ) somewhat longer periods are found for the hmxb with evolved ( supergiant ) companions which transfer mass via a strong stellar wind ( e.g. , 1700@xmath34377 , 1538@xmath34522 , vela x-1 ) .",
    "the hmxb with the longest orbital periods ( up to hundreds of days ) have be star primaries ( see section 2.1.1 ) .",
    "these have very eccentric orbits , which can only be explained if neutron stars get a kick velocity at their formation ( van den heuvel 1994 ; verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 ) .",

    "almost all hmxb show x - ray pulsations , which indicates that the accreting compact stars in these systems are strongly magnetized neutron stars ( for reviews of various aspects of x - ray pulsars see , e.g. , joss & rappaport 1984 ; nagase 1989 ; white et al .",

    "pulse arrival time measurements for pulsating hmxb , in combination with radial - velocity observations of their massive companions , have provided information on the masses of accreting neutron stars .",
    "this is discussed in section 4 .",
    "x - ray pulse periods show long - term changes which are caused by a combination of external accretion torques , and internal torques due to the coupling of the crust and the core of the neutron star ( see , e.g. , henrichs 1983 ) . based on observations made before 1990 it appeared that sources in which the accretion takes place via an accretion disk show a fairly regular long - term spin up of the pulsar , with typical time scales of roughly @xmath50 years , and that sources with stellar - wind accretion show much more irregular spin period fluctuations ( see lamb 1988 , 1989 ; nagase 1989 , for detailed reviews , and references ) .",
    "however , the continuous monitoring of x - ray pulsars with batse since 1991 has shown that this result reflects the sparse sampling of pulse period measurements : the disk accretors show frequent torque reversals , with a bi - modal distribution of spin up / down rates .",

    "they come in a characteristic pattern such that the total energy in a burst is approximately proportional to the time interval to the following burst : the rapid burster behaves like a relaxation oscillator .",
    "this indicates that the type ii bursts are the result of an accretion instability .",
    "the sky distribution of x - ray bursters is strongly concentrated to the center of the galaxy .",

    "this indicates that the radiation observed during a type i x - ray burst originates directly from the surface of the neutron star .",

    "the decrease of the burst duration with @xmath28 indicates the decreasing importance of hydrogen in the energetics of the thermonuclear flashes , as the persistent luminosity increases .",

    ". irregular variability , which has a less immediate diagnostic value , has been observed on many time scales from early in the history of x - ray astronomy on ( lewin et al .",
    "the early developments have been summarized by bradt , kelley & petro ( 1982 ) .    our current view on fast irregular variability developed from the discovery of intensity - dependent quasi - periodic oscillations in gx 5 - 1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "1985 ) and other lmxb , and the correlation of this fast variability with the spectral properties of the x - ray source ( see lewin et al . 1988 for a review of the early developments ) .",
    "this has led to the recognition of two types of lmxb , with distinct correlated temporal and spectral characteristics ; after the shape of the tracks that they follow in x - ray colour - colour diagrams ( ccds ) these are called the z sources and the atoll sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "six z sources are known .",
    "the z - shaped track in the ccds consist of the `` horizontal '' , `` normal '' and `` flaring '' branches ( hb , nb , and fb , respectively ) . all observed changes in the sources correspond to continuous movements along the track , jumps from one part to the other do not occur . on each of the branches the rapid variability , as expressed in the power density spectrum ( pds ) , has distinct characteristics . on the hb the source intensity undergoes quasi - periodic oscillations which in the pds show up as a peak of finite width , whose centroid frequency changes from @xmath59 hz to @xmath60 hz as the intensity increases and the source moves from the left side of the hb to the top of the nb .",
    "these hb oscillations are generally interpreted as a modulation of a `` clumpy '' accretion flow at a magnetospheric `` gate '' , at a frequency equal to the spin frequency of the neutron star as seen by a `` clump '' orbiting it with the kepler frequency ( `` beat frequency model '' , alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "these hbo disappear when the source reaches the upper part of the nb .",
    "the corresponding neutron star spin periods are in the millisecond range . in spite of major efforts , coherent pulsations",
    "have not yet been been detected in the persistent emission of lmxbs ( see vaughan et al .",
    "however , coherent oscillations with millisecond periods have recently been detected during some type i x - ray bursts ( see the contribution to this volume by m. van der klis ) .    near the middle of the nb the pds shows a different type of qpo , with a near constant frequency of about 6 hz ( the same in all z sources ) .",
    "these nb oscillations are most likely the result of oscillations of the optical depth ( stollman et al .",
    "1987 ) of the accretion flow , caused by radiation feedback on the flow at a luminosity near the eddington limit ( fortner et al . 1989 ; alpar et al .",
    "a strong argument for this model was provided by the observation in cyg x-2 of an @xmath61 phase shift between oscillations above and below 5 kev ( mitsuda & dotani 1989 ) ; this pivoting of the spectrum during the 6 hz oscillations reflects the variation in the compton upscattering of photons , as the scattering optical depth varies . as the z source moves from the nb to the fb the fequency of the 6 hz oscillations increases , and the width of the qpo peak in the pds becomes much larger .",
    "the optical and uv brightness of z sources increases as the sources move from the hb via the nb to the fb ( vrtilek et al .",
    "1991 ; augusteijn et al .",
    "this indicates that the mass accretion rate increases along the z track in that order . since along the nb the count rate decreases going from the hb to the fb this shows that count rate can be anti - correlated with mass accretion rate .",
    "the ccds of atoll sources , many of which are burst sources , show a `` banana branch '' , along which the source moves on a time scale of hours , and `` islands '' where the source stays for much longer time intervals . in the banana state the pds contains only a power law component , called the `` very - low - frequency noise '' . in the island state",
    "the pds is dominated by a broad - band noise component , called `` high - frequency noise '' , which has a power law shape at high frequencies , but which flattens below a cut - off frequency @xmath62 . between the island state and the banana state the mass accretion rate increases ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "atoll sources are on average much less luminous than z sources ; however , it is unlikely that the differences in their spectral and temporal properties are only the result of a difference in accretion rate .",
    "hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) suggested that the neutron star magnetic fields in the atoll sources are systematically weaker than those in the z sources .",
    "several broad noise components ( e.g. , `` very - low - frequency noise '' , `` high - frequency noise '' ) in the power spectra of the z sources and atoll sources have also been found in the power spectra of x - ray pulsars and black - hole candidates .",
    "an example is the strong similarity between the pds of island - state atoll sources and those of accreting black holes in the low ( or `` hard '' ) state ( see sect .",
    "3.3 ) , including the so - called belloni - hasinger ( 1990 ) effect , i.e. , the invariance of the high - frequency part as @xmath63 changes ( yoshida et al . 1993 ) . a proposal to unify the phenomenology of the power spectra of these different types of accreting compact stars",

    "the bursts from the bursting pulsar groj174428 are type ii bursts ( see sect .",

    "this mutual exclusion of bursts and pulsations supports the idea that it is a weaker magnetic field , and not only alignment of the field axis , which distinguishes the neutron stars in lmxb from those in hmxb .",
    "there are two possible ways to understand this difference . in the first place",
    ", the magnetic fields of the ( generally old ) neutron stars in lmxb may be much weaker than those of the ( young ) neutron stars in hmxb , because they have always been very weak .",
    "this difference might be related to a difference in the formation mechanism of neutron stars in hmxb and lmxb , @xmath70 via the normal evolution of a massive star , and via the accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf , respectively .    an alternative possibility is suggested by the observation that the neutron stars in hmxb are all young objects , whereas those in lmxb are typically much older : the magnetic fields of neutron stars decay . until recently it was generally believed that all young neutron stars have strong dipolar magnetic fields @xmath71 g ) , which decay spontaneously on a time scale of order @xmath72 years , to a bottom value of order @xmath73 g .",
    "( the possibility that a substantial fraction of young neutron stars have magnetic fields much stronger than the canonical @xmath48 g is discussed by d. frail in this volume ) . however , on the basis of a detailed analysis of the properties of the young radio pulsar population bhattacharya et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and hartman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that such spontaneous decay does not occur ( with a lower limit to the exponential time scale for such decay of about @xmath74years ) .",
    "it has been suggested that decay of the magnetic field of a neutron star may be caused by the accretion process , either directly ( e.g. , by field burial , romani 1990 ) or indirectly . a possibility that is currently investigated extensively ( srinivasan et al .",
    "1990 ; ding et al . 1993",
    "; ruderman 1991a , b , c ) is that before the phase of fully developed mass transfer the neutron star is spun down by the braking torques exerted by matter flowing in at a low rate from the secondary star ( possibly induced by the pulsar wind ) which is ejected at the rapidly rotating magnetosphere ( `` propeller effect '' ) .",
    "the `` forced '' spin down of the neutron star ( which occurs only if they are in a binary ) corresponds to the outward motion of the quantized vortices ( which carry the rotation of the superfluid core of the neutron star ) , whose interaction with the quantized magnetic flux tubes drags the latter along toward the crust , where ohmic decay would lead to a decrease of the magnetic field ( see the contribution of m. ruderman to this volume ) .    possible observational constraints on these considerations may be obtaind from the relation between the orbital period , @xmath35 , and the neutron star spin period , @xmath75 , observed for low - mass binary millisecond pulsars ( lmbps ) , the descendants of lmxbs ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 , and verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 , for reviews ) . one way to approach this is to assume some simple relation between the @xmath76 field of a neutron star ( i.e. , its dipolar component ) and the amount , @xmath77 , of matter accreted ( see , e.g. , taam & van den heuvel 1986 ) .",
    "combining this with a description of the evolution of lmxbs toward the lmbps leads one to expect a relation between the orbital and spin periods of lmbps , since @xmath75 is determined by @xmath76 and the mass transfer rate @xmath78 , and the latter depends on the orbital parameters ( see , e.g. , de kool & van paradijs 1987 ; van den heuvel & bitzaraki 1995 ; li & wang 1997 ) . for reasonable choices of the parameters in the @xmath79 relation these evolutionary scenarios",
    "can reproduce the observed @xmath80 relation for lmbps quite well , but so does the spin - down induced field decay model ( jahan min & bhattacharya 1994 ) .",
    "it should be noted that accretion - induced magnetic - field decay does not necessarily imply a relation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "for instance , in the model of konar & bhattacharya ( 1997 ) @xmath76 is related not to @xmath77 but to the rate , @xmath78 , of accretion .",
    "a few lmbps do not at all fit the @xmath81 relation ; it has been argued that in these systems the neutron star was formed by the accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf ( van den heuvel & bitzaraki 1995 ) .",
    "however , as pointed out to me by dr .",
    "r. wijers , this argument depends on the acceptance of an assumed simple @xmath82 relation ; the argument collapses if other parameters determine the evolution of the neutron star magnetic field ( see also wijers 1997 ) .",
    "the relation between accretion and a neutron star s magnetic field strength remains an unsolved issue , and its clarification is central to an understanding of the evolution of neutron stars in binaries .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , the first x - ray source which was shown to be a member of a binary star , cyg x-1 , was a strong black - hole candidate as well . in the words of the discoverers : `` the mass of the companion probably being larger than about 2 m@xmath3 , it is inevitable that we should also speculate that it might be a black hole .

    "we now know that the spectral hardening is caused by the weakening of an ` ultra - soft' component in the x - ray spectrum , signalling a transition from a `` high '' ( or `` soft '' ) state to a `` low '' ( or `` hard '' ) state ( see section 3.3 ) .    following the discovery of the binary x - ray pulsar cen x-3 ( schreier et al .",

    "a few years later , mcclintock & remillard ( 1986 ) measured the mass function of the transient source a  062000 ( which also had a very soft x - ray spectrum during its outburst in 1975 ) after it had returned to quiescence , to be @xmath83  m@xmath3 .",
    "this immediately ( see below ) showed that the compact star in this system is too massive to be a neutron star , and gave some confidence in the idea that x - ray spectra may be an efficient way to select bhxbs .    in spite of the fact that some x - ray spectral characteristics of black holes , and rapid variability are also seen in some neutron stars , their combined presence , in particular in x - ray transients",
    ", has remained strikingly effective in singling out black holes .    as implied in the above discussion , the main argument",
    "that the compact object in a particular x - ray binary is a black hole , is that neutron star masses can not exceed a certain maximum value .",
    "this assumption rests on very general considerations , e.g. , that sound can not travel faster than light , on the basis of which nauenberg & chapline ( 1973 ) and rhoades & ruffini ( 1974 ) concluded that any neutron star , independent of the equation of state ( eos ) of high - density matter , must have a mass @xmath84m@xmath3 .",
    "rotation of the neutron star ( ignored in the above analyses ) does not increase the mass limit by more than 20% ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "detailed modelling of neutron stars , for a wide range of equations of state , leads ( see fig . 10 ) to upper mass limits between @xmath85  m@xmath3 ( very soft eos ) and @xmath86  m@xmath3 ( very stiff eos ) ( see , e.g. , arnett & bowers 1977 ; datta 1988 ; cheng et al .",
    "1993 ; cook et al . 1994 ; engvik et al . 1996 ; see also the contribution of n. glendenning to this volume ) .",
    "the fact that compact objects with dynamical mass estimates exceeding @xmath87  m@xmath3 can not be neutron stars , is not equivalent to their being black holes , as defined by the particular space - time structure described by schwarzschild and kerr metrics , which are characterized , in particular , by the absence of a hard surface .",
    "this has led to the extensive use of the term `` black - hole candidate '' for these objects .",
    "of course , detection of x - ray pulsations or x - ray bursts immediately disqualifies a compact star as a black hole , but positive evidence for the absence of a hard surface has been very hard to obtain .",
    "this should not come as a surprise , since a nominal ( @xmath88m@xmath3 , @xmath89  km ) neutron star is just 2.5 times larger than its schwarzschild radius , and one may expect the accretion flow to be very similar to that of a black hole of comparable mass .",
    "the energy release at the neutron star surface , which is absent for a black hole , might lead to observable differences in spectra and variability , but unless the origin of the spectra and variability of x - ray binaries is much better understood than it is nowadays , the conclusion that a black hole has been found on the basis of such phenomena must be considered weak at best .",
    "this difficulty is illustrated by the fact that the spectral and variability characteristics of atoll sources are very similar to those of black holes in their low state ( see sect .",

    "relativistic effects on disk spectra were discussed by hanawa ( 1989 ) based on earlier work by page & thorne ( 1974 ) : gravitational redshift changes photon energy and rate of arrival of photons as measured by the observer ; rotational velocities in the disk and bending of photon paths give rise to inclination dependent effects ( which ultimately requires folding in of the limb darkening of the disk emission ) .",

    "x - ray spectra of bhxbs often contain a very hard power law component , which in some cases has been observed up to the mev range ( see fig .",

    "van paradijs & van der klis ( 1994 ) showed that there is a general anti - correlation between spectral hardness in the 13 - 80 kev range and x - ray luminosity , and that the x - ray spectra of ns - lmxb with @xmath142 ( likely island state atoll sources ) are as hard as those of black - hole binaries ( see also the review of gilfanov et al . 1995 ) .",
    "currently available data ( see the comprehensive summary by barret et al .",
    "1996 ) are consistent with the idea that only bhxb can show the combination of a hard power law x - ray spectrum and a high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath143 erg / s ) .",
    "the ls power spectra of accreting black holes are strikingly similar to those of atoll sources in the island state ( see fig .",
    "14 ) , not only with respect to the shape of the broad - band noise component , but also with respect to the invariance of its high - frequency part as the low - frequency cut off changes ( belloni - hasinger effect ) .",
    "together with the spectral similarities this suggests that at low accretion rates the dominant factors in the emission processes near black holes in the ls and near weakly magnetized neutron stars in the island state are the same ; in particular , the presence of a hard surface in the case of accreting neutron stars , and possibly of a significant magnetic field , do not appear to have much effect on the x - ray spectral and temporal properties .",
    "another example of strong similarity between accreting weak - field neutron stars and black holes is provided by cir x-1 , whose pds , when it is very bright , is very similar to those of bhxbs in the vhs ( see van der klis 1995 ) , in particular by the presence of a high - frequency broad - band noise component and qpo .",
    "this is consistent with the idea ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) that cir x-1 is an atoll source ( i.e. , the neutron star magnetic field is very weak ) accreting near the eddington limit .",
    "the black - hole power spectra in the vhs ( but not that of cir x-1 ) show higher harmonics of these qpo ; this may be a distinguishing property of these objects .",
    "a remarkably high fraction of the currently known bhxb are lmxb transients ( see tables 2 and 3 ) .",
    "since these transients were first studied in the 2 - 10 kev range , where the ultra - soft component can be seen , they are often referred to as soft x - ray transients ( sxt ) , in spite of their often very hard power law spectra at higher energies .",
    "sxt are characterized by sudden relatively brief increases in x - ray luminosity ( outbursts ) , separated by long periods of very low x - ray emission ( quiescence ) .",
    "the observed intervals between outbursts range from about a year to 60 years , and it is highly likely that all sxt are recurrent . during the outburst",

    "> from the comprehensive summary of the properties of sxt by chen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) it appears that typical outburst rise and decay times are a few days , and about a month , respectively .",
    "however , one can not be but struck by the variety in the observed outburst histories ( see fig .",
    "it is not always clear , though , in how far this reflect variations in mass accretion rate , rather than major changes in the x - ray spectra .",
    "the outbursts are caused by the sudden increase of the rate of accretion onto the compact object .",
    "this increase is most likely caused by a disk instability , analogous to that operating in dwarf novae , which occurs if the disk is sufficiently cool , i.e. , the mass transfer rate , @xmath144 , is below a critical value ( which depends on the orbital period ) .",
    "these critical values for sxts are much lower than those for dwarf novae , because at a given value of @xmath78 x - ray heating can keep the disk hotter in lmxb than in cvs , which stabilizes them ( van paradijs 1996 ; king et al . 1996 ; see van paradijs & verbunt 1984 , for a comparison of the properties of sxts and dwarf novae ) .    during the outburst the optical emission is completely dominated by reprocessing of x rays in the accretion disk , but in quiescence the optical emission betrays the presence of the low - mass companion ( thorstensen et al .",
    "1978 ; van paradijs et al . 1980 ; mcclintock & remillard 1986 ) .",
    "this allows the measurement of doppler shifts ( mcclintock & remillard 1986 ) , which in so far seven cases has led to dynamical evidence that the compact object in these sxts is a black hole ( see table 2 ) .    during quiescence",
    ", the x - ray luminosity , @xmath31 , appears to depend strongly on the nature of the compact star : for neutron star systems it is of order @xmath145 ergs@xmath53 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1987 ; verbunt et al .",
    "1994 ) , for black holes it can be as small as @xmath146 ergs@xmath53 ( narayan et al .",

    "have argued that this difference can only be understood if the flow in the inner disk of quiescent sxts is advective . at low mass transfer rates",
    "the time scale for radiative cooling of the inner disk becomes longer than the radial - flow time scale , and liberation of gravitational potential energy leads to an increase of internal energy of matter in the disk . in the case of a black hole",
    "most of this internal energy can flow through the horizon of the hole , but for neutron stars it must emerge as it reaches the neutron star surface .",
    "the detailed spectral modelling by narayan et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) has provided good evidence that the objects that we suspect are black holes on the basis of their mass functions , do not have a hard surface as is expected from general relativity .",

    "the neutron core is a very hot convective nuclear - burning region ; a high li abundance may build up if the residence time of matter in the lithium producing region is short enough that most of the lithium formed there is transported outward to cooler regions where it can not be destroyed any more . in the later phases of the thorne - ytkow object neutrino losses become the dominant energy loss mechanism , leading to an effective reduction of the eddington limit .",
    "the resulting large rates of accretion onto the neutron core may lead to the formation of a black hole .",
    "the secondary is formed from the collapsing envelope of the thorne - ytkow object .",
    "\\(ii ) martin et al .",
    "( 1994a ) have argued that li is produced in the sxt systems themselves , during the outbursts , by spallation of cno elements ( mainly by protons ) as well as @xmath147 reactions .",
    "this requires that at least a few percent of the accretion energy must be converted to particle acceleration to energies exceeding 10 mev / nucleon ( martin et al .",
    "an advective flow near the compact star may provide the environment in which the spallation occurs ( yi & narayan 1997 ) .    the absence of certified black holes in persistent lmxb of course reflects the severe difficulty , if not impossibility , of measuring the orbital motion of the low - mass companion .",

    "this is of great importance in distinguishing black holes from neutron stars in x - ray binaries .            to complete the mass determination one needs the orbital inclination @xmath91 , for whose determination several methods are available , at least in principle : ( i ) x - ray eclipse durations , ( ii ) optical light curves , and ( iii ) polarization variations .    for a spherical companion star with radius @xmath158 and a circular orbit ( separation @xmath222 , period @xmath166 ) the duration of the eclipse of a point - like x - ray source is related to @xmath91 by the expression :      here @xmath224 , with @xmath225 half the duration of the eclipse . if the relative size of the companion is known , @xmath91 is a function of @xmath226 only .",

    "since these companions fill their roche lobes , the potential parameter @xmath228 is determined by @xmath227 , and therefore the light curve depends on @xmath227 and @xmath91 only . if needed , the generally small contribution from the quiescent accretion disk may be estimated from a study of the broad - band energy distribution , and corrected for .",
    "the contribution of the disk diminishes with increasing wavelength , and recent orbital light curve studies are therefore preferentially carried out in the infra - red ( casares et al .",
    "1993 ; beekman et al . 1996 ; shahbaz et al .",
    "the ellipsoidal light curves of sxt in quiescence have played an important role in the mass estimates of black holes .",
    "however , one should not ignore haswell s ( 1995 ) emphasis that also for quiescent sxt the ellipsoidal light curves may be affected by systematic effects , possibly caused by variable contributions from an accretion disk , analogius to the superhumps in the su uma subgroup of the cataclysmic variables .",
    "in addition to the above standard ingredients of a mass determination for x - ray binaries two additional pieces of information may be used .",
    "the first applies when the source distance is known .",
    "since the apparent magnitude of the companion star ( corrected for interstellar extinction ) and its spectral type together determine its angular radius , for these sources one can estimate the radius , @xmath235 , of the companion star , and this constrains the relation between @xmath92 and @xmath236 .",
    "this was used by gies & bolton ( 1986 ) in their analysis of cyg x-1 . in case",
    "the companion star fills its roche lobe , the constraint is simple : for such stars the density is determined by the orbital period alone ( see , e.g. , frank et al .",
    "1992 ) , and @xmath236 follows immediately from @xmath235 . in the case of the sxt cen x-4 ( whose compact star is a neutron star ) this served to show that the companion mass is extremely low , less than 0.2m@xmath3 ( chevalier et al . 1989 ; mcclintock & remillard 1990 ) .",
    "if the orbital angular momentum is parallel to that of the companion star ( and therefore of the matter flowing through the accretion disk ) , both @xmath214 and the observed rotational velocity @xmath237 of the secondary have been decreased by the same projection factor sin@xmath91 .",
    "therefore , their ratio is not affected .",
    "as shown by gies & bolton ( 1986 ) this constrains the relation between @xmath92 and @xmath236 . in case the companion star co - rotates at the same angular velocity as the orbit , this constraint is an estimate of the mass ratio . using the expressions for the radius of the roche lobe by paczynski ( 1971 ) , one obtains ( kuiper et al .",
    "1988 ; wade & horne 1988 ) :      the cancellation of the sin@xmath91 factor has also been applied to the rotational velocity at some radial distance in the accretion disk , as inferred from emission line profiles .",
    "warner ( 1976 ) applied this to cataclysmic variables , and johnston et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to the sxt a062000 . since relatively litle",

    "optical pulsations have been detected from her x-1 and 4u162667 .",
    "these pulsations arise from the reprocessing of pulsed x rays in the companion star and the accretion disk , and can be used to study the orbital parameters of these systems .",
    "a detailed analysis of the optical pulsations of her x-1 was made by middleditch & nelson ( 1976 ) .",
    "the orbital motion of the neutron star is known from the doppler shifts of the x - ray pulse arrival times .",
    "optical pulsations in phase with the x - ray pulsations are present , but also optical pulsations with a slightly different frequency .",
    "the former arise from reprocessing in the accretion disk , the latter from the surface of the companion ; their frequency difference is just the orbital frequency ( beat frequency relation ) .",
    "the pronounced variation with orbital phase of the amplitude of the optical pulsations indicates that the companion is non - spherical and fills its roche lobe . by assuming that across the surface of the roche lobe filling companion the x - ray reprocessing time is constant middleditch & nelson used the doppler shift information of these optical pulsations to estimate the mass ratio , which together with the eclipse duration and the x - ray mass function leads to @xmath256m@xmath3 and @xmath257m@xmath3 .",
    "these values are consistent with those obtained from the radial - velocity curve of the late a - type companion star ( reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "doppler shifts of the 7.7 s x - ray pulsations of 4u162667 have not been detected so far : @xmath258 ms ( levine et al . 1988 ) .",

    "( 1981 ; see also chakrabarthy et al .",
    "> from a detailed modelling of these pulsations , similar to that for her x-1 , they derived @xmath259m@xmath3 and @xmath260m@xmath3 .",
    "the results of the mass estimates , described in sections 4.2 and 4.3 are summarized in table 2 ( black holes in x - ray binaries ) , table 4 ( radio pulsars ) , and table 5 ( neutron stars in x - ray binaries ) . from these tables",
    "one may draw the conclusion that with few exceptions neutron star masses are consistent with a relatively narrow mass range near the `` canonical '' value of 1.4m@xmath3 .",
    "the anomalously low value of the neutron star mass for 4u2129 + 47 ( horne , verbunt & schneider 1986 ) may be due to contaminating light by a star that may be a distant outer companion in a triple or a foreground star ( garcia et al . 1989 ; private communication from f. verbunt ) .",
    "vela x-1 and cyg x-2 present interesting examples of substantially higher neutron star masses , but the possible presence of systematic effects on these mass determinations has to be investigated before the consequence , i.e. , that very soft equations of state are excluded , can be accepted .    *",
