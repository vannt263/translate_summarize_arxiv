    "the past years demonstrated the devastating consequences when financial markets collapse .",
    "the instability of the financial system is closely connected to that of banks and related institutions which , in turn , is directly coupled to the losses when the obligors , _ i.e. _ , the companies or individuals that borrowed money , default and are unable to fully repay",
    ". in the recession following a market break down , a higher than usual number of defaults occur  @xcite , severely worsening the situation .",
    "the crisis of 20072009 was triggered by false assessment of the risk involved with subprime mortgage credits @xcite .",
    "the ensuing bankruptcy of lehman brothers  @xcite then released an avalanche effecting the world economy as a whole .",
    "economists who saw the problems piling up have pointed out the importance of improved credit risk estimation  @xcite . however , a quantitative study satisfying the standards common in physics is missing . here , we want to close this gap by transferring a standard tool from statistical physics , namely ensemble average , to credit risk estimation .",
    "the problem can be traced back to the peculiar shape of a loss distribution @xmath0 for a portfolio consisting of a large number of credit contracts .",
    "it is the probability density function ( pdf ) of the dimensionless loss @xmath1 relative to the total exposure , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the entire amount of money given out in the credits",
    ". typically , an empirical loss distribution looks as shown in fig .",
    "[ draw ] .     versus the relative loss @xmath1.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the asymmetry and the heavy tail on the right hand side are striking .",
    "they are caused by the specific properties of the credit contracts : the highest possible gain for the bank issuing the credits is only due to interest and risk compensation , depending on the creditworthiness .",
    "it occurs only if not a single credit defaults . on the other hand , the largest possible loss results from a complete loss of the lent money",
    "the danger lies in the heavy tail , which describes the probability for large losses that exceed the possible gains by far .",
    "individual , large defaults such as enron or lehmann brothers as well as simultaneous defaults of many small obligors as in the subprime mortgage crisis are the events making this tail so heavy .",
    "thus , the issue of instability can be reformulated as the question whether or not it is possible to get rid of this heavy tail .",
    "financial institutions often claim that this can be achieved by simply enlarging the number of obligors and credit contracts in the portfolio .",
    "the resulting _ diversification _ is then believed to reduce the risk for the bank .",
    "this view has been severely criticized , both with qualitative reasoning @xcite and quantitative studies addressing this important issue in the economics literature , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "intuitively , it is not difficult to understand why the concept of diversification is highly questionable .",
    "if the obligors are correlated by some mutual dependencies , the default events will appear clustered . only in the economically unrealistic case of zero correlations , diversification can work .",
    "our goal is to identify generic features of credit risk using a standard approach from statistical physics : an ensemble approach for correlations . as an application",
    ", we then show that diversification is bound to fail .",
    "we even derive an exact limiting loss distribution .",
    "we use a `` microscopic '' model , referred to as `` structural '' in economics , put forward by merton  @xcite . while `` reduced  form '' models , see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite , only provide an abstract description of default events , the structural model traces defaults and losses back to stochastic processes describing the economic state of each individual obligor .",
    "suppose @xmath2 obligors hold credit contracts which bind them to pay back the amount of money @xmath3 , referred to as face value , at the maturity time @xmath4 .",
    "the stochastic variable @xmath5 is the economic state , _",
    "i.e. _ , the value of the @xmath6-th company , which can be retrieved after a bankruptcy and paid to the creditors . as fig .",
    "[ fig : merton ]     falls below the face value @xmath7 at maturity time @xmath4.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    shows , the stochastic process now leads to a distribution of outcomes @xmath8 at maturity . in the cases",
    "@xmath9 , the obligor is able to make the promised payment , the cases @xmath10 are default events .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the whole face value @xmath7 is lost .",
    "rather , the normalized dimensionless loss of contract @xmath6 is @xmath11 the heaviside function ensures that the loss is strictly positive , because only the default events are to be taken into account .",
    "the entire credit portfolio comprises the individual losses of all @xmath2 contracts .",
    "the corresponding portfolio loss is the sum of the individual losses @xmath12 weighted by their fraction @xmath13 in the portfolio @xmath14 the distribution of the portfolio loss is then given by @xmath15 g(v|\\sigma ) \\delta \\left(l - \\sum_{k=1}^{k } f_k l_k \\right ) \\quad , \\label{eq : loss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the multivariate distribution of the economic states at maturity , @xmath17 .",
    "importantly , it depends on the @xmath18 covariance matrix @xmath19 measuring the above mentioned mutual dependencies between the obligors .",
    "the innocent  looking integral is a highly non ",
    "trivial object , first , because the @xmath12 contain , according to eq .  , a heaviside function and , second , because the multivariate distribution @xmath16 of the economic states at maturity is unknown .",
    "it was merton s seminal idea to estimate the stochastic processes @xmath5 by the stock prices @xmath20 , provided all @xmath2 obligors are companies listed on the stock market .",
    "we assume this from now on . in this merton model",
    "it has been shown by numerical simulations  @xcite that the heavy tail of the loss distribution remains in the presence of even weak correlations . in a less realistic setting , referred to as first passage model with constant recovery and correlated defaults , this had already been found in the economics literature  @xcite .",
    "although the empirical stock market data give us , in principle , access to @xmath16 , the formidable complexity of the stock market dynamics keeps us still far from achieving a generic understanding beyond the numerical case studies of ref .",
    "the crucial problem is the non  stationarity which is commonly studied for the returns , _",
    "i.e. _ , for the dimensionless differences of the stock prices @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is referred to as return horizon . neither the standard deviations or volatilities @xmath23 of the individual returns @xmath24 , nor the correlations @xmath25 of any pair @xmath26 are constant in time .",
    "we recall the relation @xmath27 with @xmath28 between covariance and correlation matrix . to handle this non ",
    "stationarity new concepts are called for . here",
    ", we transfer the idea of ensemble averaging from statistical physics . to the best of our knowledge , this whole approach is new in the economics literature . according to eq .  , we need @xmath16 which is obtained from the more easily accessible distribution @xmath29 depending on the @xmath2 component vector of the returns  .",
    "recently , we constructed this distribution and confirmed its validity by a careful data analysis  @xcite .",
    "we showed that @xmath30 is a _ multivariate _",
    "gaussian , @xmath31 if the data are sampled in a data interval short enough that @xmath32 is constant  @xcite .",
    "importantly , we are interested in maturity times @xmath4 of at least a month or so .",
    "as the maturity time sets the return horizon , @xmath33 , the well  known heavy tails of the _ individual _ return distributions are not so pronounced yet . moreover , as we consider the _ multivariate _ distribution of all returns , the heavy tails of the _ individual _ return distributions are further suppressed . however , we are interested not in short , but in larger data intervals ( not to be confused with the return horizon ) where sizable non  stationarity is present .",
    "we take it into account by averaging over the correlation matrices .",
    "we use the wishart distribution  @xcite of the correlation matrices @xmath34 , @xmath35 which defines an ensemble of correlation matrices @xmath34 that fluctuate around the mean correlation matrix @xmath36 , calculated for the entire data interval .",
    "the model matrices @xmath37 have dimension @xmath38 , where @xmath39 formally corresponds to the length of the model time series .",
    "it is a free parameter to be determined from the data later on .",
    "it governs the variance of the distribution   and thus the strength of the fluctuations around @xmath36 .",
    "we break the entire data interval into many short ones for which the observation   is justified and we put @xmath40 .",
    "the average @xmath41 w(w|c , n )   g ( r|\\sigma ww^\\dagger\\sigma ) \\label{eq : ansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then accounts for the non  stationarity .",
    "the result only depends on @xmath27 , calculated over the entire data interval , it reads @xmath42 with the bessel function @xmath43 of the second kind of order @xmath44 .",
    "we demonstrated the validity of this result by obtaining @xmath19 directly from the data and by fitting @xmath39  @xcite . here , however , it is advantageous to make the additional approximation that all off  diagonal correlation matrix elements are equal , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath45 , hence @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath18 unit matrix and @xmath48 is a @xmath2 component vector with unity in all entries . by averaging all off  diagonal matrix elements of @xmath36 measured in the whole data interval , we find @xmath49 for monthly and @xmath50 for yearly returns . the data set consists of 306 stocks from the s&p 500-index in the time interval from 1992 to 2012  @xcite .",
    "to test our result   with the approximation  , we rotate the returns into the eigenbasis of @xmath19 and scale with the eigenvalues . integrating out all but one rescaled return , denoted @xmath51 ,",
    "we have @xmath52 figure  [ fig : pic4 ] shows the fit to the data which determines the value of @xmath39 .     for monthly returns @xmath53 trading days ( top ) and yearly returns @xmath54 trading days ( bottom ) for the model covariance matrix .",
    "the insets show the linear - linear plot.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the fit for return horizons @xmath55 of a month or a year  which later on carries over to the maturity times @xmath4  is very good with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the tails are heavy , deviations only appear beyond the third decade .",
    "the merit of the above construction is the drastic reduction in the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the return distribution of the highly complex , non  stationary market is now fully and quantitatively characterized by the two parameters @xmath58 and @xmath39 measuring the mean and the variance of the fluctuations .",
    "this identification of generic features out of a very large number of quantities is reminiscent of statistical mechanics where a few macroscopic variables characterize a large system that is microscopically described by a huge number of variables .",
    "hence , we are now able to also uncover generic features of credit risk . here , we greatly expand our previous work  @xcite to the more realistic case of a non - zero average correlation level and , in addition , we give an empirical verification of our approach . according to eq .  , the averaged loss distribution reads @xmath59 \\langle g\\rangle ( v|\\sigma , n )                           \\delta \\left(l - \\sum_{k=1}^{k } f_k l_k \\right ) \\ . \\label{avloss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we infer the price distribution @xmath60 from our result   for the returns .",
    "the assumption that the stock prices @xmath20 follow a geometric brownian motion with drift and volatility constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , leads to a multivariate gaussian of the form   for the returns .",
    "hence , this is fully consistent with the above ensemble approach .",
    "our data comparison thus strongly corroborates the usage of the geometric brownian motion .    to make analytical progress",
    ", we write the return distribution   as a fourier integral in the @xmath2 component vector @xmath63 @xmath64}{(2 \\pi)^k }                      \\exp \\left(- \\text{i } \\omega \\cdot r - \\frac{z}{2n } \\omega^\\dagger\\sigma\\omega\\right ) \\label{eq : pavg } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we insert the approximation   and linearize the square of the scalar product @xmath65 in the exponent by another fourier transform in @xmath66 , say .",
    "the @xmath63 integral is then trivial and we find after straightforward steps @xmath67 following merton but extending his idea to our ensemble approach , we now use the averaged return distribution to estimate the averaged distribution @xmath60 of the economic states @xmath8 at maturity . according to it s lemma",
    "@xcite we set @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "we notice @xmath70 . inserting this into eq .",
    "yields the exact expression for the averaged loss distribution within our model .    to enforce simplicity",
    ", we consider a credit portfolio in which all face values are of the same order , implying that @xmath71 . as the number of obligors",
    "@xmath2 is large , we may safely carry out a second order approximation in @xmath72 .",
    "again , after tedious but straightforward steps , we eventually arrive at the double integral representation @xmath73 for the average loss distribution . here",
    ", we have @xmath74 with the moments of order @xmath75 given by @xmath76 the upper bound of integration is @xmath77 and the change of variables leads to @xmath78 . since the integral can be expressed in terms of special functions , we are left with only the @xmath79 and @xmath66 integrals which have to be evaluated numerically .",
    "and a correlation level of @xmath49 with drift @xmath80 @xmath81 , volatility @xmath82 @xmath83 , @xmath84 trading days ( top ) and for @xmath85 , a correlation level of @xmath50 with drift @xmath86 @xmath87 , volatility @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 year ( bottom ) .",
    "the dotted and dashed line are for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , while the solid line shows the limit @xmath93.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    further simplifications occur in the interesting case of a homogeneous credit portfolio , in which all parameters for the obligors are the same , face value @xmath94 , variance @xmath95 , drift @xmath96 and initial value @xmath97 .",
    "of course , this does not mean that the actual paths explored by the stochastic processes are the same .",
    "the fractions are now all equal , @xmath98 , the same is true for the moments @xmath99 .",
    "importantly , this allows us to calculate the strict limit @xmath100 of the averaged loss distribution  .",
    "the gaussian in eq .   becomes a @xmath101 function such that @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the zero of the first moment , @xmath104 .",
    "this partly implicit formula yields a strict lower bound for the tail of the averaged loss distribution .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : kdep ] we show our result   for homogeneous credit portfolios of different sizes @xmath105 , compared with the limiting curve for a maturity time of @xmath90 month ( top ) and @xmath90 year ( bottom ) .",
    "the parameters are chosen according to the data analysis , so we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 . from the data",
    "set we find a drift of @xmath80 month@xmath106 and @xmath86 year@xmath106 , volatility of @xmath82 month@xmath107 and @xmath88 year@xmath107 and an average correlation level of @xmath49 and @xmath50 depending on the time horizon .",
    "the face value is @xmath108 and the initial value is @xmath109 .",
    "both have the dimension currency .",
    "notice that for the maturity time of one month the probability of a default is much smaller due to the lower volatility and the reduced time horizon .",
    "one clearly sees that the tails of the averaged loss distribution for finite @xmath2 very quickly reach the limiting curve for @xmath100 .",
    "we thus arrive at the truly disturbing observation that diversification generically can not work for any realistic choice of correlation structure .",
    "we uncovered and derived generic features of the loss distribution for credit portfolios .",
    "our starting point was the merton model which is known to give a realistic description . by transferring the concept of ensemble averaging to this problem",
    ", we were able to derive an averaged portfolio loss distribution which depends on only two parameters that fully account for the non  stationary dynamics of the markets .",
    "data analysis strongly corroborates our approach . as an important application",
    ", we showed that diversification is bound to fail for a homogeneous portfolio .",
    "this is due to the correlations which are always present in reality .",
    "pictorially speaking , they glue together the obligors and thereby let them act to some extent like just one obligor .",
    "thus , we have no reason to hope that diversification can work for any other non  homogeneous but realistic credit portfolio .",
    "all this is tantamount to saying that there is an intrinsic instability in the markets which can not be overcome .",
    "we emphasize that we did not study `` credit contagion '' or avalanche effects after the onset of a crisis , as for example in ref .",
    "we uncovered the substantial , unavoidable stability risk which is always there , even in periods in which the markets appear quiet .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to advertize a considerable enlargement of the equity held by the banks and other creditors ."
