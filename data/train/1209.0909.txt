    "the classical schur horn theorem@xcite , @xcite , relates the digonal and the eigenvalue list of a hermitian matrix : let @xmath9 be a positive semidefinite element of @xmath10 and let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the lists of diagonal entries and eigenvalues respectively , both sorted in non - increasing order .",
    "then , the schur - horn theorem says that we must have @xmath13    the above condition on the lists is denoted by saying that the diagonal list is majorized by the eigenvalue list , written @xmath14 .",
    "the schur - horn theorem states that further , given two positive lists @xmath15 with @xmath14 , then there is a positive semi - definite matrix @xmath9 with eigenvalues @xmath16 and diagonal @xmath17 .",
    "majorization can also be defined for matrices .",
    "given two positive operators @xmath18 in @xmath10 , we say that @xmath19 if the eigenvalue sequence of @xmath9 is majorized by the eigenvalue sequence of @xmath20 . the schur - horn theorem",
    "can then be stated as saying that if @xmath9 is a diagonal positive matrix and @xmath20 a positive matrix so that @xmath21 , then there is a unitary operator @xmath22 so that the diagonal of @xmath23 is @xmath9 .",
    "majorization for matrices has the following alternate description due to hardy , littlewood and polya@xcite ,    given two self - adjoint operators @xmath18 in @xmath24 , @xmath9 is majorized by @xmath20 iff @xmath25 for every continuous convex real valued function @xmath26 defined on a closed interval @xmath27 $ ] containing the spectra of both @xmath9 and @xmath20 .",

    ", unitary equivalence can not be determined from spectral data alone . on another note ,",
    "it is trivial to see that the above theorems about diagonals for positive operators immediately yield identical theorems for hermitian operators , by adding a suitable constant to make them positive .    a special case of the above theorem , namely , that given any positive contraction @xmath9 in @xmath0 , there is a projection @xmath43 in @xmath2 so that @xmath44 , had been conjectured earlier by kadison in @xcite , see also @xcite , who referred to it as the  carpenter  problem in type @xmath1 factors .",
    "neither of the two theorems directly implies the other .",
    "it is however , easy to see that theorem([conj2 ] ) implies theorem([conj1 ] ) when @xmath20 has finite spectrum .",
    "there has been methodical progress towards the resolution of arveson and kadison s conjecture ( [ conj2 ] ) : argerami and massey@xcite showed that @xmath45 this was improved by bhat and ravichandran@xcite , who showed that it is enough to take the norm closure .",
    "they also showed that the conjecture holds when both the operators @xmath9 and @xmath20 have finite spectrum .",
    "dykema , hadwin , fang and smith@xcite gave a natural way to approach the problem and reduced the conjecture to a question involving kernels of conditional expectations . using this approach",

    "however , it is unclear if their strategy can be be used to settle the conjecture in full .",
    "it must be pointed out that approximate schur - horn theorems are easier to obtain than exact ones .",
    "further , it is possible that one might lose much fine structure : for instance , kadison characterised the diagonals of projections in @xmath46 and discovered an index obstruction to a sequence arising as the diagonal of a projection .",
    "this subtlety is lost when ones passes to the norm closure of the set of diagonals , see @xcite for a discussion",
    ".    there has been a great deal of progress towards characterising the diagonals of hermitian operators in @xmath46 ; unlike the finite dimensional case , the situation in infinite dimensions is highly subtle .",
    "bownick and jasper have given a complete description of the possible diagonals of hermitian operators in @xmath46 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in another direction , the diagonals of compact operators have been characterised by loreaux and weiss in @xcite , extending the earlier work of kaftal and weiss in @xcite .",
    "i end with a recent development ; thompson s theorem in matrix algebras characterises operators which can realised to have a prescribed diagonal in terms of their singular values .",
