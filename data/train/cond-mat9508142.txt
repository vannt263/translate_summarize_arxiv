    "in a recent letter @xcite critical indices of the superconducting - to - normal phase transition were derived starting from a dual formulation of the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to review this approach .",
    "the article , which is pedagogical in tone and attempts to be self - contained , highlights also some recent developments related to the symmetry aspects of the dual formulation which are important for understanding the phase transition .",
    "the basic idea of the dual approach originates from three - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) lattice studies carried out more than 15 years ago @xcite .",
    "these studies were instigated by the success of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) theory of the @xmath1 @xmath2 model developed in the early seventies to describe the phase transition in a superfluid film @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the phase transition has its origin in the behavior of point - like vortices . in the ordered low - temperature phase",
    ", pairs of vortices with opposite topological charge are tightly bound . above the critical temperature , these pairs unbind and the liberated vortices",
    "disorder the system , turning the superfluid into a normal fluid .",
    "the lattice studies of the pure @xmath0 @xmath2 model @xcite and its extension to a lattice superconductor @xcite were aimed at obtaining an analogous description of the phase transitions in these models in terms of vortex _ loops_. a detailed account of these matters as well as an extensive list of references to the literature can be found in the textbook by kleinert @xcite .",
    "another development illuminating the dual approach to the ginzburg - landau model was initiated in ref .",
    "the basic observation was that since a local gauge symmetry can never be broken @xcite , a local gauge description of a phase transition is not feasible .",
    "it was argued that the @xmath0 ginzburg - landau theory contains , in addition to the local gauge symmetry , another _ global _",
    "u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "when considered in @xmath3 space - time dimensions with a minkowski metric , this symmetry is generated by the magnetic flux operator .",
    "it was demonstrated that this symmetry is broken in the normal phase , while it is unbroken in the superconducting phase .",
    "an order parameter was given , and it was shown that the massless photon of the normal phase is the goldstone particle associated with the broken flux symmetry .    to clarify the concept of duality",
    "it is expedient to remain for the moment in @xmath3 space - time dimensions .",
    "there the theory is a quantum field theory possessing particle states which are created by field operators .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the space - time approach of feynman @xcite where worldlines of particles are the fundamental objects .",
    "the particle s mass is given by the tension of the worldline .",
    "now , suppose that a quantum field theory contains point - like solitons , i.e. , topologically stable , time - independent solutions of the field equations .",
    "when set into motion such a soliton traces out a non - trivial worldline in space - time .",
    "an operator description of these excitations in terms of the original fields is non - local and quite difficult .",
    "the aim of the dual approach of the type we are considering is to describe them by a local field , called a disorder field @xcite .",
    "the space - time description of the particle is thus converted into an equivalent field - theoretic one .    in the context of the ( three dimensional euclidean ) ginzburg - landau theory",
    "the notion of a particle state is of course missing .",
    "the above picture has , however , a direct counterpart , viz .",
    ", worldlines of the space - time approach correspond to vortices in the euclidean theory .",
    "more precisely , in the setting of statistical ( as opposed to quantum ) field theory , a dual theory describes vortices by a disorder field .",
    "( in this discussion we restricted the notion of duality to line defects , thereby omitting dual theories of other topological defects such as domain walls and  in the context of quantum field theory  instantons . )    the advantage of the dual theory is that it allows for a simple description of the superconducting phase transition in the sense of landau which is impossible in the original formulation , as we shall discuss .",
    "the order parameter of the transition is the field representing the magnetic vortices .",
    "this landau theory , involving only a global symmetry and a genuine order parameter , can  as usual  be taken as a convenient starting point of a renormalization group analysis of the superconducting phase transition @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we illustrate the dual approach by considering the ginzburg - landau model in two space dimensions .",
    "this example gives us important clues towards the form of the dual formulation in @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : twofold ] we review the fact that a loop gas can be succinctly described near a critical point by a @xmath4 field theory .",
    "this equivalence plays a central role in the subsequent part of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3dl ] we discuss the dual formulation of a @xmath0 lattice superconductor , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : dual ] we review the formulation in the continuum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixed ] we argue that the dual theory yields the standard description of the mixed state of a type - ii superconductor . as a consistency check",
    "we consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : normal ] the dual formulation of the dual theory and demonstrate that the resulting theory is the original ginzburg - landau model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sop ] we discuss the gauge - invariant superconducting order parameter . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : landau ] we apply renormalization group theory to the dual theory to show that the superconducting phase transition is of second order .",
    "the critical exponents are shown to be in the universality class of the @xmath2 model with the temperature axis reversed .",
    "before discussing the theory of a superconductor in three space dimensions , it is instructive to first study the two - dimensional case .",
    "this exercise will exhibit the relevant variables in a dual description and show what in principle can be expected from such a description .",
    "the ginzburg - landau model resulting from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity is specified by the hamiltonian @xmath6,\\ ] ] with @xmath7 the electromagnetic gauge potential .",
    "we adopt the standard notation and denote by @xmath8 the local induction . the symbol @xmath9 is reserved for the spatial average of the local field , and will be referred to as the magnetic induction , or flux density .",

    "the variable @xmath23 is a phase variable and is thus cyclic with periodicity @xmath24 .",
    "a jump in @xmath23 by @xmath24 along a cut in the spatial plane indicates the presence of a point vortex .",
    "when this is the case the hamiltonian requires a field @xmath22 to compensate for these jumps so that @xmath18 remains smooth .",
    "such a construction with a compensating field is well known in the villain formulation of lattice models , and it can also be given in the continuum @xcite .",
    "the curl of @xmath25 gives the density of vortices consisting of @xmath26 functions at each vortex position @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the winding number of a vortex , and @xmath29 its location .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to vortices with unit winding number , @xmath30 for a vortex and antivortex , respectively .",
    "since the theory is charged , vortices carry also a magnetic flux quantum @xmath31 , and are more properly called _",
    "magnetic vortices_.    the solution of ( [ vdensity ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath26 function on the line @xmath34 which starts at the position of the @xmath35th vortex @xmath36 and runs to spatial infinity along an arbitrary path : @xmath37 with the help of stokes theorem in two dimensions which can be expressed in differential form as @xmath38 it is easy to check that the explicit expression ( [ line ] ) for the field @xmath39 indeed solves eq .",

    "a massless gauge field in @xmath1 represents no physical degrees of freedom . in minkowski space - time , this is easily understood by recognizing that in @xmath49 dimensions there is no transverse direction .",
    "the system contains therefore only a single physical degree of freedom before the higgs mechanism took place , namely @xmath23 .",
    "this equals the number afterwards since a massive vector field represents only one independent degree of freedom in @xmath1 .",
    "note that the absence of genuine long - range order in @xmath1 is no obstacle to the higgs mechanism .",

    "the matrix element @xmath488 is @xmath199 if the two lattice sites @xmath89 and @xmath489 are neighbors , and zero otherwise . from ( [ lenergy ] )",
    "we immediately read off the lattice correlation function @xmath490 the operator @xmath491 we expand in a von neumann series @xmath492 where we introduced the abbreviation @xmath493 from the definition of the step operator @xmath42 it follows that @xmath494 is equal to the number of paths which go from site @xmath495 to site @xmath489 in @xmath276 steps . by virtue of this",

    "let us first concentrate on the probability ( [ prob ] ) and assume that the length @xmath84 of a path on a lattice is measured in some  as yet arbitrary  unit @xmath507 .",
    "that is , a path of @xmath276 steps has length @xmath508 .",
    "since in the limit @xmath509 @xmath510^n \\rightarrow \\left(1 - \\frac{a^2}{2d } { \\bf k}^2 \\right)^{s / b } \\rightarrow \\exp \\left(-s \\frac{a^2}{2 d   b } { \\bf k}^2 \\right),\\ ] ] we have to take the ratio @xmath511 fixed in order to obtain a non - trivial continuum limit ; we will take @xmath512 . in other words ,",

    "but with @xmath519 given in ( [ pdensity ] ) , this is precisely the schwinger representation ( [ green ] ) of the correlation function .",
    "a similar derivation can be given for the partition function .",
    "to this end we consider the probability @xmath520 defined by the number of closed oriented paths containing @xmath276 steps divided by @xmath521 .",
    "it is related to the probability @xmath522 previously introduced via @xmath523 where the factor n arises from the fact that one can start traversing a given oriented loop at any of the @xmath276 lattice sites visited by the loop .",
    "it then easily follows that @xmath524 which is the right - hand side of the first equation in ( [ oint ] ) .",
    "this leads to the same representation of the partition function we found before with help of schwinger s proper - time representation .",
