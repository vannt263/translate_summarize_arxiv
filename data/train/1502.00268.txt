    "recently , intense interest has developed in the helical magnetic ordering of one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems of local moments coupled to itinerant electrons .",
    "such systems exhibit a variety of intriguing many - body phenomena , such as spin - peierls instabilities@xcite and induced topological superconductivity,@xcite which result from the details of magnetism , electronic structure , and electron - electron interactions .",
    "these phenomena may be relevant for a wide variety of physical systems , ranging from magnetic atoms on superconducting  @xcite and normal metal  @xcite substrates , to single walled carbon nanotubes  @xcite and semiconductor - based quantum wires .",
    "@xcite    while much of the work in this area so far has focused on static and thermodynamic properties of the 1d helimagnets , a richer understanding may be gained by developing and employing new _",
    "probes for assessing the behaviors of these systems .",
    "for example , an interesting self - tuning effect was proposed for systems dominated by a ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky)-type interaction :  @xcite the local moments are predicted to order into a spiral arrangement which , through coherent backscattering , gaps out one spin channel of the itinerant electron system for _ any value _ of the electron density .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon was even suggested as providing a route towards realizing topologically protected majorana bound states in quantum wires .",
    "@xcite however , because direct probes of magnetization are unavailable for many systems , it can be challenging to positively identify this intriguing magnetic state ( necessarily via indirect means ) .",
    "@xcite with further theoretical understanding of dynamical responses , such as typical damping or relaxation times , additional tests ( e.g. , density quenches which change the preferred ordering wave vector ) could be used to clarify the natures of the underlying states .    more generally ,",
    "magnetization relaxation processes determine the magnetic response to external perturbations as well as to spontaneous thermal fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the nature of the magnetic response is crucially important for noise and magnetization dynamics in magnetoelectronic devices .",
    "@xcite a better understanding of the spin dynamics in 1d helimagnets may pave the way for exploring phenomena such as current - driven magnetization dynamics , with potential practical applications beyond those envisaged so far .",
    "thus , the investigation of microscopic damping mechanisms is essential for developing a thorough fundamental and practical understanding of these exciting new magnetic systems .        given the motivations above , in this work we investigate the relaxation of 1d helimagnets via the emission of collective excitations into the interacting itinerant electron system .",
    "note that the 1d nature of the itinerant system is important  our theory is meant to describe quasi-1d systems with a single transverse mode at the fermi energy ( e.g. , semiconductor quantum wires  @xcite ) .",
    "the elementary excitations of these 1d electronic systems are plasmons , which describe density waves .",
    "interestingly , previous theoretical works have predicted that electron - electron interactions in such 1d systems may play important roles both in establishing ordering  @xcite and in the relaxation dynamics of weakly - coupled ( non - ordered ) nuclear spins .",
    "@xcite in this work , we use a bosonization approach to study the non - perturbative effects of electron - electron interactions on the damping of _ ordered _ spins .",
    "we find that interactions have a profound effect on damping , leading to an enhancement of the damping by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the damping has a highly non - local character .",
    "consequently , the thermal fluctuations become spatially correlated over the entire sample .",
    "we estimate the characteristic magnetization relaxation times due to this mechanism for two classes of systems : ( ga , mn)as quantum wires and nuclear helimagnets formed in gaas quantum wires .",

    ", in which the conductance of a gaas - based quantum wire was observed to drop from @xmath134 to @xmath135 when the temperature was reduced to below 0.1 k. the appearance of an @xmath135 plateau hints at the lifting of spin - degeneracy , and was interpreted as evidence of the formation of a nuclear spin helix .",
    "importantly , within the model used to interpret the experiment , the spatial period of the helix tunes itself to be equal to half of the fermi wavelength , i.e. , it is directly linked to the density of the electronic system .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of an @xmath135 plateau is directly linked to this commensuration between the ordering and fermi wavevectors .",
    "a rapid change of backgate voltage which alters the electron density should thus destroy the commensurability ; just after such a quench , one would then expect to observe a conductance of @xmath134 , which would gradually return to a value of @xmath135 as the nuclear system finds its new equilibrium order , on a timescale set by the magnetic relaxation rate .",
    "taking similar assumptions and parameter values to those of the model used to support the conclusions of ref .  , we predict very long relaxation times for the nuclear magnetic order , on the order of milliseconds or more .",
    "nuclear spin diffusion , another possible important relaxation mechanism , is expected to become effective on longer timescales ( see appendix  [ app2 ] ) .",
