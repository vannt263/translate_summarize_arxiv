    "<S> we present a complete study of r - parity violating supersymmetric effects in thirteen exclusive and inclusive semi - leptonic @xmath0 decays , including @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 decay modes , and we find those thirteen modes are very sensitive to the constrained r - parity violating couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we derive stringent bounds on relevant r - parity violating couplings , which are based on all existent experimental upper limits of involved semi - leptonic decays . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also investigate the sensitivities of the branching ratios and di - neutrino invariant mass spectra to the survived r - parity violating coupling spaces . </S>",
    "<S> since the experimental bounds would become much better soon through super - b , we expect that future experiments will greatly strengthen our bounds .    </S>",
