    "although the bulk of the electromagnetic energy output of spin - powered pulsars is typically expected above 10 mev , only @xmath2 0.5% of the radio pulsar population has been clearly identified in the gamma - ray domain @xcite . such meager harvest is to be ascribed , most probably , to the relatively low sensitivity of gamma - ray instruments with respect to radio and x - ray telescopes .",
    "poor gamma - ray pulsar statistics has been a major difficulty in assessing the dominant mechanism which channels pulsar rotational energy into high - energy emission as well as understanding the sites where charged particles are accelerated .",
    "the dominant mechanisms and sites of the emission most probably depend on the rotational period @xmath3 and magnetic field @xmath4 of the neutron stars , with the millisecond pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) behaving differently from the `` classical '' , higher magnetic field ones .",
    "population synthesis simulations , featuring comprehensive statistical analysis of diverse models of emission geometry and beaming , yielded very different numbers of radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars potentially detectable as gamma - ray emitters ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , such simulations are poorly constrained by the source sample currently available and only a much larger sample of gamma - ray pulsars could help discriminating different emission models .",

    "the sensitivity to photons with energy in the range 30 mev to 30 gev of the  gamma - ray imaging detector ( grid ; @xcite ) together with a time tagging accuracy of a few @xmath5s and a very large field of view ( @xmath6@xmath7 radius ) all make  perfectly suited for the detection of the time signature of new gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "the large field of view of  allows long uninterrupted observations and simultaneous monitoring of tens of nearby radio pulsars belonging to the `` gamma - ray pulsar region '' of the @xmath3@xmath8 diagram characterized by @xmath9 g and spin - down energy @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 @xcite .    at variance with the behavior at soft x - ray energies , where the emission is proportional to the rotational energy loss over the squared distance factor ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is pulsar distance ; e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the expected gamma - ray flux of radio pulsars is directly correlated to the goldreich  julian current / open field line voltage @xcite .",
    "it can be estimated according to the law @xmath0 @xcite , which is known to reasonably fit egret pulsars .",
    "the large dispersion of such fit ( probably due to different beaming fractions ) provides the minimum / maximum normalization values , allowing a worst / best case approach for the gamma - ray flux estimates .",
    "following such an approach , we have built a sample of @xmath2 100 radio - loud pulsars which are likely to be above the sensitivity threshold ( @xmath14 ph  @xmath15 s@xmath11 at @xmath16 mev ) .",
    "of course , we are fully aware that the actual number of detections will depend upon the emission model geometry and efficiency .    top - ranking targets with poor  exposure , well - known pulsars already deeply investigated at the epoch of egret observations , and sources reserved to the  guest observer program were excluded from our list which encompasses 35 gamma - ray pulsar candidates . in this letter",
    "we present results about isolated pulsars only .",
    "the five pulsars in binary systems of our sample will be discussed in subsequent works .    since gamma - ray pulsar detection must start from an at least approximate knowledge of recent pulsar ephemeris , a dedicated pulsar radio monitoring campaign has been undertaken .",

    "pointings consist of long exposures , typically lasting 1030 days , slightly drifting ( @xmath291  day@xmath11 ) from the starting direction in order to match solar panel illumination constraints .",
    "the  total exposure ( computed with the grid scientific analysis task ag_expmapgen ) for the 11 month data span considered is typically @xmath29@xmath30 @xmath31 s for each target .",
    "data screening , particle background filtering and event direction and energy reconstruction were performed by the  standard analysis pipeline ( build-15 ) .",
    "we adopted the  event extraction criteria and timing procedures calibrated and optimized with the observations of known gamma - ray pulsars as described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we performed our timing analysis looking for pulsed signals using both @xmath32 mev g class events ( i.e. events identified with good confidence as photons ) and the combination of g+l events ( l events are significantly contaminated by particle background ) collected within 60  from the center of grid field of view and with an extraction radius around pulsar positions optimized as a function of photon energy according to the point - spread function ( psf ) and background level of . for noisy observations in confused regions ( e.g. for j2229 + 6114 ) ,",
    "an extraction radius of @xmath22  ( well below @xmath32 mev psf 10  for @xmath33 mev , @xmath2 5  for @xmath34 mev , and @xmath2 @xmath35 for @xmath36 gev . ] ) was used to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "source position accuracy is @xmath26@xmath35 at present level of targets exposure .    given the measured _ agile _",
    "s time tagging accuracy of @xmath26200 @xmath5s and the good radio monitoring ( i.e. , valid epoch range , adequate number of time of arrivals ( toas ) ) available for the majority of our targets , the most significant pulsed signal detection is typically expected within the errors of the radio ephemeris frequency values . in particular , we performed standard epoch folding terms are included in tempo2 ephemeris files ; @xcite ) , we account also for the pulsar timing noise in the folding procedure as reported in @xcite . ] over a frequency range defined according to 3@xmath37 errors of radio ephemeris .",
    "the frequency resolution is 0.5/@xmath38 ( where @xmath38 is the time span relative to the coverage of each target )",
    "and we oversampled it by a factor of 10 ( 0.05/@xmath38 is the frequency step of our grid ) .",
    "since the  useful data span for pulsar detection is typically of the order of few months , implying a period search resolution of @xmath2610@xmath39 s , the resulting number of independent period search trials turns out to be few tens while no independent trials on period derivatives are needed .",
    "pearson s @xmath40 statistics is applied to the 10-bin folded pulse profiles resulting from each set of spin parameters , yielding the probabilities ( weighted for the number of trials performed on the data set ) of sampling a uniform distribution , assessing the significance of the pulsed signal ( sinusoidal or not ) . in fact , applying this statistics to the well - known egret pulsars @xcite , we obtained a perfect match between the best period resulting from  gamma - ray data and the period predicted by the radio ephemeris with discrepancies comparable to the period search resolution .",
    "furthermore , we verified our timing results also applying bin - independent parameter - free statistics as the @xmath41 test @xcite and the @xmath42-test @xcite that are typically more sensitive than @xmath40 tests for the search of sinusoidal pulses .",
    "in particular , the use of the @xmath42-test is suggested if no a priori information about the light curve shape is available as in our case .    first , for each target we searched for pulsed signals using the whole available data span .",
    "later , each observation block was analyzed to check for possible flux and/or pulse profile variability .",
    "we also performed a preliminary maximum likelihood analysis ( alike task ) on the  data for the regions containing our targets in order to exploit the instrument s imaging capabilities to assess gamma - ray source parameters . here , we focus on timing analysis leaving detailed source positioning , flux and ( phase - resolved ) spectral analysis for future papers when higher counts photon statistics on each target will be available and instrument effective area calibrations will be consolidated .",
    "table [ newpulsars ] lists the emission parameters of the seven pulsars discussed in this letter .",
    "the resulting radio - aligned light curves are plotted in figure [ all ] where for each pulsar the actual bin size and energy range has been adjusted according to the available statistics and light - curve structure .",
    "we note that in all cases radio and gamma - ray timing results are compatible , with the highest significance frequency detected in gamma rays within the errors of the radio ephemeris value , considering also the period search resolution .",
    "examples of the exploration of much larger frequency search grids are shown in figures [ j2229rc ] and [ j1824xxx ] for psrj2229 + 6114 , for which the best gamma signal is within 1@xmath37 from the radio peak , and for psrj18242452 , for which the radio  gamma frequency discrepancy is comparable with the gamma - ray period search resolution . both @xmath40 statistics and @xmath41/@xmath42-test provide comparable detection significances , except for psrj2229 + 6114 .",
    "the @xmath41 test applied to this pulsar provides slighly better results than the other statistics ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 corresponding to an @xmath26@xmath37 detection ) .",
    "furthermore , we verified that our analysis procedure ( potentially affected by instrument - related systematic errors and biases in events extraction criteria ) does not produce fake detections at a significance level above 3@xmath37 when the radio - ephemeris are applied to randomly extracted data .",
    "four targets are also firmly detected by the likelihood spatial analysis .",
    "it is not surprising that spatial detection be missing for weaker targets at the present  exposure level . in high - background regions of the galactic plane",
    ", our pulsed emission search sensitivity can be better than our spatial analysis sensitivity .",
    "furthermore , timing analysis can be applied to the full  event list ( i.e. g+l event classes extending up to 60  from the center of the field of view ) , while , currently , spatial analysis is only fully calibrated for the g class events detected within 40  from the center of the field of view .",
    "however , some of the non - detections in spatial analysis are , indeed , puzzling . according to figure [ all ] , psrj2043 + 2740 has a pulsed flux and light curve very similar to psrj15135908 ( note that both are based on g+l events ) .",
    "moreover , j2043 + 2740 is out of the galactic plane , in a region well exposed and with low diffuse emission .",
    "thus , it should have been detected by the image analysis more easily than j15135908 , which sits in a higher background region , unless , of course , they have very different spectra .    pulsars in table [ newpulsars ] are ranked according to their overall detection significance .",
    "pulsars firmly detected both through timing and spatial analyses are placed above the line .",
    "pulsars detected through timing analysis alone await longer simultaneous gamma - ray and radio observations for confirmation and reliable luminosity estimation .    in table",
    "[ newpulsars ] , the most significant detection is psrj2229 + 6114 for which  detected pulsed emission ( radio / gamma - ray periods discrepancy @xmath29@xmath45 s , figure [ j2229rc ] ) and pinpointed the most likely position ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) to @xmath2@xmath48 from the radio pulsar .",
    "our detection provides a reliable identification for the previously unidentified egret source 3eg2227 + 6122 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 )",
    ". the  source position , pulsed flux , and photon index ( @xmath22.2 ) are consistent with the egret values @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray light curve of this pulsar ( detected up to over 1 gev ) , featuring just one prominent peak shifted @xmath2 180  in phase from the radio main peak , is shown in figure [ all ] .",
    "it is worth noting that assuming a distance of @xmath2 3 kpc inferred by x - ray observations @xcite and isotropic emission , the pulsar gamma - ray efficiency would be @xmath2 0.5 , a factor of 20 higher than that quoted in table [ newpulsars ] .",
    "in modern pulsar beaming models ( in particular high - altitude models ) the assumption of isotropy in luminosity calculation could be a better approximation in most cases , implying that efficiencies should be increased by roughly an order of magnitude from those based on the commonly assumed 1 sr beam @xcite .",
    "anyway , precise efficiency measurements await for a better assessment of pulsar distance , flux , and beam geometry .",
    "psrj15135908 ( b150958 ) was detected by comptel in the 1 - 10 mev range , while egret reported @xcite only marginal evidence for a weak @xmath264@xmath37 source at @xmath2 1  from the radio position , with a pulsed emission upper limit of @xmath26@xmath51 ph @xmath15 s@xmath11 .",
    "the  discovery of pulsed emission from psrb150958 relies also on a 6.4@xmath37 detection of a gamma - ray source ( possibly multiple sources ) at @xmath29@xmath52 from the radio position .",
    "the main gamma - ray peak at phase @xmath2 0.35 in the light curve is aligned with the soft gamma - ray peak seen by comptel in the 0.7530 mev band ( @xmath53 ; @xcite ) slightly trailing the hard x - rays single peaked light curves @xcite .",
    "a second possibile peak in the  light - curve at @xmath2 0.85 could have correspondence with the marginal feature seen in the 1030 mev comptel light curve .",
    "the comptel sharp spectral break between 10 and 30 mev @xcite is confirmed by our  point at 100 mev .",
    "our data imply a softening of the photon index from @xmath2 1.7 to @xmath2 2.5 going from tens to hundreds of mev .",
    "such a low - energy break , compared to the more common gev spectral break in gamma - ray pulsars , could be the telltale signature of the photon splitting process inducing significant e.m .",
    "cascade attenuation due to the strong magnetic polar field ( greater than @xmath54 g ) of this pulsar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at variance with all the other targets ,",
    "the millisecond pulsar j18242452 in the globular cluster m28 was detected by with good significance ( greater than 4@xmath37 ) and perfect radio  gamma periods match , only in the time interval 5433954344 mjd ( figure [ j1824xxx ] ) .",
    "the main radio peak at 1.4 ghz is coincident with the broad single peak seen in gamma rays .",
    "only marginal detection was obtained integrating other observations with comparable exposure or the whole data span .",
    "noise fluctuations could possibly explain the apparent variability .",
    "alternatively , although its gamma - ray efficiency and high stability of spin parameters are compatible with rotation - powered emission , some additional mechanism disturbing the neutron star magnetosphere in the dense cluster environment could be invoked to explain the variable gamma - ray phenomenology of this peculiar pulsar .",
    "timing failures at submillisecond level in some observations ( mimicking source variability ) can not be excluded .",
    "however , this seems unlikely , since we verified both timing accuracy and stability at @xmath2 200 @xmath5s level with vela pulsar observations .",
    "confirmation of this tantalizing result about physical variability will rest on longer monitoring campaigns .",
    "psrj10165857 stands out in table [ newpulsars ] for its very high efficiency in converting rotational energy loss into high - energy gamma rays .",
    "this may be ascribed to distance uncertainties , as happened to be the case for the recently discovered psr j2021 + 3651 @xcite for which the distance derived from the dispersion measure is certainly overestimated .",
    "furthermore , we note that the position ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) and flux of the gamma - ray source is only marginally compatible with 3eg10135915 , for which multiple associations were proposed @xcite .",
    "the region , originally covered by the gamma - ray source 2cg28400 , discovered by cos - b @xcite , is very complex .",
    "other nearby sources , and in particular pulsar psrj10165819 ( not belonging to our sample ) , could significantly contribute to the high flux observed by  in this region .    of the remaining three pulsars ,",
    "detected only through timing analysis , the most notable is certainly psrj2043 + 2740 which , with an age in excess of one million years , would be the oldest ordinary ( nonrecycled ) pulsar seen in the gamma - ray domain .",
    "the precise measurements of its flux will yield its luminosity and thus its efficiency , a parameter of paramount importance for the understanding of gamma - ray emission as a function of the pulsar age .    according to their timing and spatial analysis outcomes , light - curve profiles , and radio  gamma phasing upshots , psrj2229 + 6114",
    ", j15135908 and j18242452 can be considered rather solid detections .",
    "if the detection of j10165857 , j2043 + 2740 , j13576429 , and j15245625 will also be firmly established , our seven object sample , together with the detection of j2021 + 3651 @xcite , would imply that gamma - ray emission is a common feature of luminous radio - loud pulsars , be they young or old .",
    "indeed , our list encompasses the second youngest ( j15135908 ) and by far the oldest nonrecycled pulsar ( j2043 + 2740 ) detected at gamma - ray energies .",
    "the gamma - ray pulsar search and the improvement of  timing procedures requiring unprecedented long integrations is an ongoing effort , in close collaboration with the radio observers .",
    "we trust that the new gamma - ray pulsar detections presented here will trigger multiwavelength observations ( e.g. in x - rays ) simultaneous to the continuously improving  and _ fermi _ ( formerly _ glast _ ) exposures on these targets .",
    "the availability of high - resolution light curves and their precise multiwavelength phasing will pave the way to improve pulsar models as well as our understanding of the pulsar population as a whole .",
