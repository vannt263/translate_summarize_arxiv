    "optimization appears in many areas of scientific computing , since the solution of a problem can often be described as the minimum of an optimization problem .",
    "local methods such as gradient descent are often employed to handle global minimization problems .",
    "they can be very efficient to compute a local minimum , but the output depends on the initial guess and they give no guarantee of a global solution .    in the case where the function @xmath0 to minimize is a polynomial , it is possible to develop methods which ensure the computation of a global solution . reformulating the problem as the computation of a ( minimal ) critical value of the polynomial @xmath0 ,",
    "different polynomial system solvers can be used to tackle it ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but in this case , the complex solutions of the underlying algebraic system come into play and additional computation efforts should be spent to remove these extraneous solutions .",
    "semi - algebraic techniques such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition or extensions @xcite may also be considered here but suffer from similar issues . though the global minimization problem is known to be np - hard ( see e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "a practical challenge is to device methods which take into account `` only '' the real solutions of the problem or which can approximate them efficiently .",
    "* previous works . * about a decade ago , a relaxation approach has been proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) to solve this difficult problem . instead of searching points where the polynomial @xmath0 reaches its minimum @xmath1 , a probability measure which minimizes the function",
    "@xmath0 is searched .",
    "this problem is relaxed into a hierarchy of finite dimensional convex minimization problems , that can be solved by semi - definite programming ( sdp ) techniques , and which converges to the minimum @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this hierarchy of sdp problems can be formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities on moment matrices associated to the set of monomials of degree @xmath2 for increasing values of @xmath3 .",
    "the dual hierarchy can be described as a sequence of maximization problems over the cone of polynomials which are sums of squares ( sos ) .",
    "a feasibility condition is needed to prove that this dual hierarchy of maximization problems also converges to the minimum @xmath1 , ie . that there is no duality gap .    from a computational point of view",
    ", this approach suffers from two drawbacks :    1 .",
    "the hierarchy of optimization problems may not be _ exact _ , ie .",
    "it may not always convergence in a finite number of steps ; 2 .",
    "the size of the sdp problems to be solved _ grows exponentially _ with @xmath3 .    to address the first issue ,",
    "the following strategy has been considered : add polynomial inequalities or equalities satisfied by the points where the function @xmath0 is minimum .",
    "inequality constraints can for instance be added to restrict the optimization problem to a compact subset of @xmath4 and to make the hierarchies exact @xcite , @xcite .",
    "natural constraints which do not require apriori bounds on the solutions are for instance the vanishing of the partial derivatives of @xmath0 .",
    "a result in @xcite shows that if the gradient ideal ( generated by the first differentials of @xmath0 ) is zero - dimensional , then the hierarchy extended with constraints from the gradient ideal is exact .",
    "it is also proved that there is no duality gap if `` good '' generators of the gradient ideal are used . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that the extended hierarchy is exact when the gradient ideal is radical and in @xcite the extended hierarchy is proved to be exact for any polynomial @xmath0 when the minimum is reached in @xmath4 ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the relaxation techniques are analyzed for functions for which the minimum is not reached and which satisfies some special properties `` at infinity '' .    from an algorithmic point of view",
    ", this is not ending the investigations since a criteria is needed to determine at which step the minimum is reached .",
    "it is also important to known if all the minimizers can be recovered at that step .",
    "methods based on moment matrices have been proposed to compute generators of the ideal characterizing the real solutions of a polynomial system . in @xcite , the computation of generators of the ( real ) radical of an ideal",
    "is based on moment matrices which involve all monomials of a given degree and a stopping criterion related to curto - fialkow flat extension condition @xcite is used .",
    "this method is improved in @xcite .",
    "combining the border basis algorithm of @xcite and a weaker flat extension condition @xcite , a new algorithm which involves sdp problems of significantly smaller size is proposed to compute the ( real ) radical of an ideal , when this ( real ) radical ideal is zero - dimensional . in @xcite , an algorithm",
    "is also proposed to compute the global minimum of the polynomial function @xmath0 based on techniques from @xcite .",
    "it terminates when the gradient ideal is radical zero - dimensional .",
    "an interesting feature of these hierarchies of sdp problems is that , at any step they provide a lower bound of @xmath1 and the sos hierarchy gives certificates for these lower bounds ( see e.g. @xcite and reference therein ) . in @xcite it is also shown how to obtain `` good '' upper bounds by perturbation techniques , which can directly be generalized to the approach we propose in this paper .",
    "* contributions . *",
    "we show that if the minimum @xmath1 is reached in @xmath4 , a generalized hierarchy of relaxation problems which involve the gradient ideal @xmath5 is exact and yields the generators of the minimizer ideal @xmath6 from a sufficiently high degree .    in the case where the minimizer ideal is zero dimensional",
    ", we give a criterion for deciding when the minimum is reached , based on the flat extension condition in @xcite .",
    "this criterion is used in a new algorithm which computes a border basis of the minimizer ideal of a polynomial function , when this minimizer ideal is zero - dimensional .",
    "the algorithm is an extension of the real radical algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the rows and columns of the matrices involved in the semi - definite programming problem are associated with the family of monomials candidates for being a basis of the quotient space , i.e , a subset of monomials of size much smaller than the number of monomials of the same degree .",
    "thus , the size of the sdp problems involved in this computation is significantly smaller than the one in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we show that by solving this sequence of sdp problems , we obtain in a finite number of steps the minimum @xmath1 of @xmath0 , with no duality gap .",
    "when this minimum is reached , the kernel of the hankel matrix associated to the solution of the sdp problem yields generators of the minimizer ideal which are not in the gradient ideal . assuming that the minimizer ideal @xmath6 is zero dimensional , computing the border basis of this kernel yields a representation of the quotient algebra by @xmath6 and thus a way to compute effectively the minimizer points , using eigenvector solvers .",
    "an implementation of this method has been developed , which integrates a border basis implementation and a numerical sdp solver .",
    "it is demonstrated on typical examples .    *",
