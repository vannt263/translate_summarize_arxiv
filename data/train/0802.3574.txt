    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are a unique class of objects ( e.g. lin & mohr 2004 ) .",
    "they tend to lie very close to peaks of the clusters x - ray emission and in the velocity space they sit near the cluster rest frame .",
    "these galaxies are the most luminous and massive galaxies in the universe .",
    "the bcgs are variously classified as giant ellipticals , d galaxies , or cd galaxies because of the extended envelope of excess light .",
    "the optical morphology often shows evidence of past or recent galaxy mergers ( e.g. multiple nuclei ) .",
    "all these properties indicate that they may have a quite unusual formation history compared to other e galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are intimately related to the collapse and formation of the cluster : recent models suggest that bcgs must have an earlier origin and that galaxy merging within the cluster during collapse in cosmological hierarchy is a possible alternative .    in the radio band bcgs",
    "are more likely to host radio - loud agn than other galaxies of the same mass ( best et al .",
    "2006 ) and very often their radio morphology shows evidence of a strong interaction with the surrounding medium as a distorted tailed structure ( wat sources ) , strong confinement , buoyancy effects and so on .",
    "the radio morphology is very various : some bcgs show a standard tailed structure ( wat ) very extended on the kpc scale as 3c465 in a2634 ( e.g. eilek et al . 1984 ) , or with a small size as ngc 4874 in the coma cluster ( feretti & giovannini 1985 ) ; in other cases we have diffuse and amorphous sources , either extended ( e.g. 3c 84 in perseus ) or with very small size ( e.g. a154 , feretti & giovannini 1994 ) .",
    "the recent result that in every / most of cooling core clusters is present an active radio bcg ( eilek & owen , 2006 ) suggests that the radio loud agn could be the origin of the energy necessary to arrest or slow down the cooling process as shown by the presence of cavity in the radio emitting gas coincident with the presence of radio lobes ( see e.g. dunn & fabian 2008 and references there in )",
    ".    on the parsec scale bcgs are not yet well studied as a class of source .",
    "only a few of them have been observed because are well known radio galaxies . in some cases they look as normal fr i radio galaxies with relativistic collimated jets often one - sided because of doppler boosting effects ( e.g. 3c465 in a 2634 , and 0836 + 29 in a690 ; venturi et al .",
    "however there are also cases where two - sided symmetric jets are present in vlbi images , and it is not clear if they are highly relativistics or not ( e.g. 3c338 in a2199 , gentile et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we started a phd project to observe with vlba ( nrao ) a complete sample of bcgs in abell clusters selecting nearby clusters ( distance class lower than 3 ) with a declination larger than 0@xmath0 .",
    "all clusters have been included with no selection on the cluster conditions ( e.g cooling ) and no selection on the bcg radio power .",
    "the sample is presented in table 1 , where ( 1 ) in the notes column indicates clusters where we observed the bcg with vlba observations at 6 cm , ( 2 ) means that we asked for vlba observing time , and ( 3 ) clusters where the bcg is a well known radio galaxy with published vlbi data .",

    "the resolution of final maps is typically 2.8 @xmath2 1.5 mas and the noise level is @xmath3 0.05 mjy / beam .",
    "among observed cluters mostly detected sources show a one - sided structure , but we did not detect three sources despite of the high sensitivity of our images . in particular we did not detect the bcg in a262 identified with a b2 radio galaxy ( ngc 708 ; parma et al .",
    "1986 ) suggesting that at present the core is not in a very active phase .    in table 2",
    "we show the list of observed clusters and of the few clusters with published data .",
    "we have separated non relaxed clusters and relaxed clusters with a cool core .",
    "the number of clusters with radio data is small , and results are very preliminary , however we note that in non relaxed clusters the large scale radio structure suggests a strong interaction with the surrounding medium ( wide angle tail or head tail sources ) and in most of these sources we found one - sided parsec scale jets .",
    "we interpret this structure as due to doppler boosting effects in relativistic , intrinsically symmetric jets .",
    "the two bcgs in clusters with a cool core show a two - sided symmetric pc scale structure , and for both sources it is not clear if jets are highly relativistic or not ( the bcg in a262 has not been detected in our vlbi images ) .",
    "this difference between relaxed and non relaxed clusters could suggest that in the parsec scale region of cool clusters there is a strong interaction between radio jets and the surrounding medium and jets slow down very soon .",
    "this suggestion is supported by literature data on the bcgs of more distant clusters as e.g. 4c26.42 , the bcg in the cool cluster a1795 , where vlbi images show a distorted symmetric structure ( liuzzo et al . in preparation ) , and hydra a ( the bcg of the cool cluster a780 ) , where taylor ( 1996 ) suggested that the emission from the symmetric pc scale jets is more dependent on interactions with the surrounding material than on doppler boosting .",
