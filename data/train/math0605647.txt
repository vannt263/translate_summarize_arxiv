    "] , i give some examples of calabi - yau elliptic spaces , and discuss the associated chern - simons type actions . the most obvious example is when @xmath2 is a compact oriented manifold , @xmath46 is a vector bundle on @xmath2 and @xmath47 .",
    "this yields ordinary chern - simons theory .",
    "the first non - trivial construction of this note is to give a calabi - yau elliptic space whose associated chern - simons type action is a version of yang - mills theory on a compact oriented four manifold with a conformal class of metrics .      in section [ section forms moduli ] , i give a construction of forms on the moduli space of metrised ribbon graphs , associated to a calabi - yau elliptic space with a metric . if @xmath48 denotes the space of metrised ribbon graphs with @xmath49 incoming and @xmath50 outgoing external vertices , i define maps @xmath51 here @xmath52 is a certain rank one local system on @xmath48 .",
    "these maps are compatible with the differentials , with gluing of ribbon graphs along external vertices , and with disjoint union .",
    "the construction is related to witten s construction @xcite of a measure on moduli space associated to chern - simons theory .",
    "let @xmath53 be the subspace of ribbon graphs of genus @xmath54 with @xmath55 boundary components .",
    "this space is homeomorphic to the moduli space @xmath56 of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath54 with @xmath55 with unparameterised boundary components at each puncture .",

    "the local system @xmath52 corresponds to the orientation local system on the manifold @xmath56 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath57 be the space of such ribbon graphs which have @xmath49 external vertices , with the property that the lengths of the edges attached to the external vertices is @xmath58 , and that the external vertices are a non - zero distance apart .",

    "thus , the map @xmath63 we construct gives a map @xmath64 where @xmath65 refers to the orientation sheaf .",

    "when @xmath68 , the cohomology class of this is the same as that obtained by applying kontsevich s construction @xcite to the @xmath69 with the structure of cyclic @xmath70 algebra coming from the homological perturbation lemma .    in the case when @xmath5 is a @xmath19 graded cy elliptic space of dimension @xmath22 , so that the trace is of degree @xmath23 , then @xmath71 is of degree @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath73 .",
    "this makes it clear that the case @xmath74 plays a special role .      in section [ section cs ]",
    ", i describe a relationship between these forms and the chern - simons type action associated to @xmath5 , when @xmath18 is odd .",
    "the relationship is very similar to that between open string theory and chern - simons theory discovered by witten @xcite .",
    "consider the algebra @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the algebra of @xmath77 complex matrices .",
    "we can think of @xmath78 as @xmath77 matrices with coefficients in @xmath5 .",
    "the operators @xmath79 extend to @xmath78 by acting on the entries of a matrix . combining the trace map @xmath11 with matrix trace",
    "gives a trace map @xmath80 .",
    "consider the action @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "here we work with @xmath2 with @xmath83 , i.e.  the trace map @xmath11 is odd .",
    "we will consider @xmath84 to be an even functional on the supervector space @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 be the purely quadratic part of @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath87 , the space of harmonic elements in @xmath5 .",
    "we can formally write down the partition function @xmath88 @xmath89 denotes parity change , so the integral is over the linear supermanifold @xmath90 .",
    "this integral is to be understood formally , in terms of its feynman diagram expansion .",
    "we perform the feynman diagram expansion complex linearly .",
    "this means that the propagator is an element of ( some completion of ) @xmath91 , the interaction is a @xmath92-linear map @xmath93 , etc .",
    "we could alternatively pick a real subspace @xmath94 , such that @xmath95 , perform the integral over the space @xmath96 .",
    "in this case we should use the @xmath97-linear feynman diagram expansion .",
    "then it is easy to check we get the same answer as we did using the @xmath92-linear feynman expansion above .",
    "the feynman diagram expansion of @xmath98 is a formal expression of the form @xmath99 where the sum is over connected trivalent ribbon graphs @xmath100 with some external edges .",
    "the expression @xmath101 denotes a certain integral over @xmath102 , which generally _ does not _ converge . here",
    "@xmath103 is the number of internal edges in @xmath100 . to make numerical sense of @xmath98",
    ", we need to regularise these integrals in some way .",
    "also , we could try to integrate the form @xmath104 , for @xmath87 .",
    "top dimensional cells in @xmath105 are labelled by trivalent ribbon graphs @xmath100 with @xmath49 external vertices .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath106 where the sum is over certain trivalent ribbon graphs , and @xmath107 denotes the space of metrics on @xmath100 which give zero length to the @xmath49 external edges .",
    "it turns out that @xmath108 both sides of this equality represent possibly non - convergent finite dimensional integrals ; the integrals are of the same integrand over the same space .",
    "the result of this discussion is a formal equality of functions of @xmath87 , @xmath109      as i mentioned earlier , the integral of our forms on moduli space does not seem to converge in general .",
    "this is because the forms have singularities on the boundary of a natural compactification of the moduli space of surfaces with boundary .",
    "this is the compactification considered by liu @xcite . in this compactification one allows surfaces with two types of singularities : nodes on the boundary or nodes in the interior .",
    "also one allows boundary lengths to shrink to zero .",
    "our forms only have singularities on surfaces with nodes in the interior , and on surfaces which have a boundary component of length zero .",
    "one can restrict the region over which we integrate to a compact subset of the region where the forms are non - singular , and then of course the integral converges .",
    "one natural way to do this is to remove the locus of surfaces which have a very short closed loop",
    ". then we find that we are integrating over part of a set of sen - zwiebach @xcite open - closed string vertices .",
    "this is what we do if we want to construct the open - closed string partition function .    what does this construction correspond to in terms of the chern - simons theory",
    "? restricting in this way the region in moduli space over which we integrate corresponds to disallowing `` small '' subgraphs ( which are not trees ) .",
    "this is a very natural way of regularising chern - simons theory : the singularities arise precisely from such graphs .",
    "this suggests an intriguing connection between renormalisation and the sen - zwiebach bv formalism .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact oriented manifold , and let @xmath110 .",
    "the operator @xmath20 is the de rham differential @xmath111 , and the trace map @xmath11 is simply integration on @xmath2 .",
    "if we pick a metric on @xmath2 , we get a compatible hermitian metric on @xmath5 , in the usual way .",
    "then @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath46 be a flat complex vector bundle @xmath2 .",
    "then let @xmath114 .",
    "a combination of vector bundle trace and the usual volume element gives @xmath2 a volume element .",
    "then , as above , @xmath20 is the de rham differential on @xmath5 , coupled as usual to the flat connection on @xmath115 .",
    "if we pick a hermitian metric on @xmath46 and a metric on @xmath2 , we get a metric on @xmath5 which is compatible .",
    "the chern - simons type action in this example is simply the usual chern - simons action . when @xmath116 , this has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite study also the higher dimensional generalisation .",

    "consider the chain given by all ribbon trees with @xmath49 incoming vertices , one outgoing vertices , with all external edges of infinite length .",

    "the integral of our form over this cycle is an operator from @xmath439 , where @xmath440 is the space of harmonic elements of @xmath5 .",
    "this is because @xmath406 limit of the heat kernel is the operator of projection onto harmonic elements of @xmath5 .",
    "this integral yields precisely the formula for @xmath438 given by the explicit form of the homological perturbation lemma .",
    "the point is that the integral @xmath441 gives the green s operator .",
    "the integral @xmath442 gives the homotopy between the identity map and this projector .",
    "the projector and the homotopy are the data needed to construct the explicit version of the homological perturbation lemma ; this formula is given by a sum over trees , where at each internal edge we place the homotopy , and each external edge the projector .",
    "this is precisely the same as what we get by integrating our form .",
    "it follows that the class in @xmath443 associated to a calabi - yau elliptic space @xmath0 are the same as those given by kontsevich s construction @xcite applied to cyclic @xmath70 algebra @xmath69 , when @xmath68 .",
    "one can see this in more down to earth terms as well .",
    "let @xmath444 be the subspace of metrised graphs such that when we cut along all the infinite length edges , what is left is a disjoint union of trees .",
    "the inclusion @xmath444 is a weak homotopy equivalence ; this follows from the results of @xcite , but it is also easy to prove this directly .    if @xmath445 , let @xmath446 be the graph obtained by collapsing all edges of @xmath100 which are not infinite .",

    "define a cellular cocycle on @xmath447 .",
    "the complex of such cellular cochains is just the ribbon graph complex studied in @xcite .",
    "this cocycle is the same as that obtained by applying kontsevich s construction to @xmath70 algebra @xmath69 , with the @xmath70 structure given by the explicit form of the homological perturbation lemma .",
    "the results of @xcite construct for each open tcft a closed tcft .",

    "recent work of tradler and zeinalian @xcite and kaufmann @xcite give new approaches to this problem .",

    "the results of @xcite show that @xmath453 here @xmath454 can be defined using either the completed projective or ordinary tensor product .",
    "we get the same answer , because @xmath5 has finite dimensional homology with respect to the operator @xmath20 .",
    "one technical point is that as we are working with non - unital tcfts , as in @xcite section 1.6 , by hochschild homology we mean the natural hochschild homology for non - unital algebras .",
    "this is constructed by formally adjoining a unit and then working relative to the subalgebra given by the unit .",
    "the construction of the closed tcft associated to an open one in @xcite is abstract ; we define a homotopy - universal open closed theory , and restrict to the closed part of it . for the reader not familiar with @xcite ,",
    "here is a description of this universal procedure .    consider a riemann surface with open and closed boundaries , as in figure [ figure surface ] .",
    "the open boundaries are a disjoint set of closed intervals in @xmath62 , and the closed boundaries are a disjoint set of parameterised circles in @xmath62 .",

    "the initial open strings are given by the open boundary components of the surface .",
    "the free boundary can be thought of as the open string endpoints ; this is the part of @xmath61 that is constrained to lie on a d - brane .",

    "let us denote the moduli space of such surfaces , with @xmath50 incoming open and @xmath49 outgoing closed boundaries , by @xmath455 .",
    "we require that each connected component of the surfaces have at least one free boundary , and we disallow surfaces which have a connected component which an annulus with one closed boundary and no open boundaries .",
    "let us write @xmath456    now suppose we have an open tcft , given by a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath457 .",
    "for each @xmath458 , we have a complex of open states @xmath459 .",
    "this is the complex associated to @xmath49 open strings .",
    "we can assume , for simplicity , that @xmath460 for each @xmath458 .",
    "we can think of @xmath461 as being acted on by the category @xmath424 .",
    "gluing open boundaries of riemann surfaces together induces maps @xmath462 .",
    "similarly , gluing closed boundaries gives us maps @xmath463 .",
    "this means that we can think of @xmath461 as defining a @xmath464 bimodule",

    "this is a tensor product of co- and contravariant functors from the category @xmath424 .",
    "however such tensor products are defined in exactly the same way as tensor products of right and left modules over an algebra .",
    "intuitively , we can think of this construction as follows .",
    "the space @xmath466 is associated to @xmath49 closed strings .",
    "suppose we have a riemann surface with @xmath50 incoming open and @xmath49 outgoing closed boundaries , together with an element of @xmath467 , the space associated to @xmath50 open strings .",
    "then we get an element of @xmath466 .",
    "more generally , singular chains in the moduli space of such surfaces , labelled in the same way by elements of @xmath467 , yield elements of @xmath466 in the same way . finally we have to impose , in a `` derived '' sense , some natural relations expressing compatibility with gluing surfaces with only open boundary intervals .",
