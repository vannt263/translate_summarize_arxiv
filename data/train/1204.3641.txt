    "finding the earliest galaxies in the universe and characterizing their properties and contribution to the reionization of the universe are some of the most import goals of extragalactic astronomy . the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ )",
    "has significantly expanded the high - redshift frontier with the detection and study of galaxies at @xmath22 .",
    "the ultradeep wfc3/ir observations of the hubble ultra - deep field ( hudf09 ) and nearby fields have so far yielded 73 @xmath23 and 59 @xmath8 lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) candidates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , including one at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these ultradeep observations show tantalizing evidence for a rapid evolution of the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) from @xmath25 to @xmath26 and a declining star - formation rate with increasing redshift @xcite , as expected on the basis of dark matter halo assembly @xcite .",
    "however , because the ultradeep datasets cover only a few wfc3/ir fields , their dynamic range is limited by the small volume that they probe .",
    "in particular they provide poor constraints on the population of bright galaxies at @xmath8 , which are very rare and highly clustered @xcite .",
    "a complete understanding of the number density and overall shape of the lf at @xmath8 requires a large - area survey to search for the brightest galaxies at these epochs .",
    "identifying the brightest @xmath8 candidates from broad - band photometry is also of fundamental importance to provide the best targets for spectroscopic follow - up studies aimed both at confirming the redshift of the sources as well as inferring the properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in proximity of these galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic confirmation of the redshift of lbg galaxies has been carried out for large samples at @xmath27 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and recently extended out to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "these studies show that photometrically selected samples of lbgs have very low contamination ( @xmath29 , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is necessary to extend the frontier of spectroscopy further into the epoch of reionization , at @xmath0 , not only to provide definitive proof that the lbg selection continues to be reliable for candidates into the reionization epoch , but more importantly to infer the ionization state of the igm from the study of the ly@xmath30 equivalent width distribution of lbg sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at present there are several ongoing wfc3/ir surveys designed to identify a relatively large sample of bright ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ) @xmath8 galaxies , namely the candels multi - cycle treasury ( mct ) program @xcite , the hubble infrared pure parallel imaging extragalactic survey ( hippies ) @xcite , and the brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) @xcite . in the near term , the sample size of bright @xmath22 galaxies",
    "will also be augmented by cluster lensing surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( clash ; @xcite ) mct program , which recently reported the discovery of a magnified lbg candidate at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "all of these programs take advantage of multi - band _ hst _  optical nir data to search for @xmath8 galaxies as @xmath3  or @xmath4 dropouts using the lyman - break technique @xcite .",
    "currently , the shape of the bright - end of the galaxy uv lf at @xmath34 is debated .",
    "theoretical and numerical investigations predict that it should remain schechter - like @xcite , of the form @xmath35 , at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "conversely , some numerical studies have suggested a possible excess of sources at the bright end , with a non - schechter behavior tied to the inefficient onset of agn feedback at early times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , two recent papers from the candels dataset in goods - south yielded different results . @xcite found a significant excess of bright @xmath8 candidates with @xmath37 over the expectation from a schechter function using data from @xmath38  arcmin@xmath39 of area in the goods - south field .",
    "the shape of their @xmath8 luminosity function resembles a step function ( see their figure 4 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite analyzed the same dataset and derive a well - behaved schechter function for bright @xmath8 sources , consistent with the extrapolation of the lf evolution from @xmath23 and with the predictions of the lf model of @xcite .",
    "the @xcite result ( @xmath40 ) is also consistent with the first - epoch borg ( borg09 ) determination of the knee of the schechter function ( @xmath41 , with the error bar at a fixed @xmath30 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "our initial borg data were about @xmath42 mag shallower than the current candels dataset , but we already had larger sky coverage ( @xmath43  arcmin@xmath44 vs. @xmath38  arcmin@xmath44 ) .    here we take advantage of the additional fields recently acquired as part of the borg survey and update the sample of @xmath3  dropouts described in @xcite to include an additional 139 arcmin@xmath2 of area .",
    "our latest catalog now contains eight very bright ( @xmath45 ) @xmath8 candidates and an additional 25 bright @xmath8 candidates detected at lower significance ( @xmath46 ) , with @xmath47 .",
    "this is currently the largest - area search for @xmath8 candidates , now totaling @xmath48 arcmin@xmath44 .",
    "additionally , given the random pointing nature of our pure - parallel _ hst _  program , the borg dataset is distinct in that it is minimally affected by cosmic variance @xcite .",
    "therefore , this catalog is uniquely positioned to set the tightest constraints on the number density of the brightest @xmath8 galaxies and the bright end of the rest - frame ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function ( @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the borg survey in section  [ sect : survey ] .",
    "we present the observations and photometry in section  [ sect : obs ] and dropout selection in section  [ sect : select ] .",
    "the results and constraints on the @xmath8 uv lf are discussed in section  [ sect : uvlf ] .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in section  [ sect : concl ] . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53  @xmath54 .",
    "this provides an angular scale of 4.8 ( proper )  kpc  @xmath55  at @xmath56 .",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab photometric system @xcite .",
    "in 2009 we initiated the borg survey , a pure - parallel wfc3 survey that complements deep and ultradeep wfc3/ir observations by looking for very bright ( @xmath31 ; @xmath57 ) galaxies at @xmath58 @xcite by obtaining wfc3 imaging in four filters ( f606w , f098 m , f125w , f160w ) on random sightlines at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath59 ) . because luminous massive galaxies at these redshifts are expected to be clustered @xcite , the random pointing nature of our borg survey is ideal to mitigate the severe effects of cosmic variance @xcite .",
    "in fact , our current survey geometry of 59 independent wfc3/ir fields makes our number counts of @xmath8 galaxies essentially follow a poisson distribution and can be used to constrain the luminosity function as well as a contiguous single - field survey with about two times more area at the same depth .",
    "if all the borg area had been in a single field of @xmath60 arcmin@xmath2 , we derive from @xcite that cosmic variance would have dominated over poisson uncertainty for a sample of 33 candidates ( @xmath61 vs. @xmath62 respectively , for a total fractional error of @xmath63 ) .    by reducing the uncertainty in the number density of bright sources due to cosmic variance",
    ", we can place stronger observational constraints on @xmath64  ( or @xmath20 ) , the characteristic luminosity of the lf .",
    "this , in turn , can help break the well - known degeneracy between @xmath20  and @xmath30 , the faint - end slope , when fitting a schechter @xcite luminosity function to the data . placing tighter constraints on the value of @xmath30 at redshifts",
    "@xmath65 is crucial in determining the contribution of galaxies to the reionization of the universe .",
    "further , the relative brightness of the lbgs discovered in the borg survey can possibly place @xmath8 galaxies within reach of ground - based spectroscopic follow - up observations , as has been attempted on some of our brighter candidates @xcite .",
    "our ongoing borg survey has covered 274 arcmin@xmath44 to date thanks both to its continuation in cycle 19 ( go 12752 , pi trenti ) and by assimilating data from the similar hippies pure - parallel program @xcite as well as the coordinated parallel observations acquired as part of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) gto program .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : survey ] , the borg survey is @xmath66 mag shallower than the `` wide '' part of the candels program that has @xmath4-band data , but has a larger area with @xmath3  ( or @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 , and @xmath6  band coverage that is needed to search for @xmath8 galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we focus on @xmath8 lbg candidates selected as @xmath3-band dropouts . to use a homogeneous selection of @xmath8 candidates ,",
    "we specifically exclude the hippies cycle 18 dataset , which replaced the f098 m band with the f105w band .",
    "we leave the identification of @xmath8 @xmath4-band dropouts for discussion in a future paper .",
    "the primary goal of the borg survey is to identify galaxies at @xmath8 and measure the bright end of the lbg rest - frame ultraviolet lf at this redshift .",
    "our observations are designed to acquire wfc3 imaging in four filters ( f606w , f098 m , f125w , f160w ) , which are obtained on random and discrete sightlines inherent to this being a pure - parallel program .",
    "we identify bright ( @xmath67 ) high - redshift galaxies by searching for @xmath3  dropouts using the well - known lyman - break dropout technique @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5  and @xmath6  bands are used for source detection and to measure the rest - frame uv color , while the wfc3/uvis @xmath68  band is used to reject low - redshift ( @xmath69 ) interloper galaxies , which are the primary source of contamination to our @xmath58 sample . as discussed in section  [ sect :",
    "select ] , our borg survey is optimized to minimize the probability of contamination from both low - redshift interlopers and cool dwarf stars .    we also included data from the similar hippies wfc3 pure - parallel program @xcite and the coordinated parallel observations from the cos gto program .",
    "the filter selection of the hippies program and the earlier part of cos gto program differs from borg in that those datasets used the f600lp filter instead of f606w to control for contamination from reddened low - redshift sources . @xcite",
    "discuss the benefits of f606w compared to f600lp .",
    "here we reiterate that , because f606w has a larger transmission efficiency integrated in frequency space over the passband , it reaches deeper at fixed integration time .",
    "this also becomes apparent in the data , for example in field borg_@xmath70 ( table  [ tbl : borg09 ] ) , which has deeper data in f606w ( @xmath71 with @xmath72 s ) compared to f600lp ( @xmath73 with @xmath74 s ) despite the shorter integration time .",
    "pure - parallel observations come with a unique set of challenges .",
    "because the primary observations are spectroscopic in nature , dithering is mostly absent in our pure - parallel wfc3 data . as a result ,",
    "detector artifacts ( e.g. , hot / warm pixels ) , uncorrected cosmic rays , and wfc3/ir detector persistence must be carefully considered in the data reduction and data analysis .",
    "to mitigate detector hot / warm pixels and cosmic rays , we employed a robust algorithm based on a variation of laplacian edge detection @xcite to filter the individual flt files prior to combining them with multidrizzle @xcite .",
    "the parameters for the algorithm were chosen to remove most sharp - edged artifacts from the data , but to also be rather conservative so as not to remove any real sources .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , our observing strategy is also unique because it is designed to minimize the impact of wfc3/ir detector persistence from observations taken in orbits immediately prior to our exposures .",
    "we take advantage of the property that the amount of residual image persistence appears to decay roughly as a power law with time .",
    "briefly , observations in either the @xmath5  band or @xmath6  band are preceded in the same orbit by a comparably long @xmath3  band exposure , and whenever possible , @xmath5-band exposures precede those in @xmath6  band .",
    "therefore any persistent residual images from prior observations will be brighter in the bluer bands and thus will not contaminate our high - redshift dropout sample .",
    "multidrizzle @xcite was used to combine individual exposures in a given filter to produce the final science images as well as the associated inverse - variance weight maps .",
    "the images are drizzled to a final pixel scale of 0.08/pixel . because borg is a pure - parallel program , the image depths vary among our fields . for a typical 4-orbit parallel field ,",
    "we obtain exposures of 2200  s , 3800  s , 1800  s , and 1800  s in @xmath68 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively . in a @xmath75 diameter aperture , the corresponding @xmath76 limiting magnitudes are approximately 27.4 , 27.1 , 26.9 , and 26.6 , respectively . in table",
    "[ tbl : borg09 ] , we list the survey fields , exposure times , and @xmath76 limiting magnitudes ( @xmath77 aperture ) of the initial borg09 dataset @xcite , and in table  [ tbl : borg12 ] we list the same properties for the new fields in the significantly expanded borg12 dataset .",
    "we have released the reduced drizzled science and rms images for the borg dataset , which is publicly available via the borg website at http://wolf359.colorado.edu/[wolf359.colorado.edu ] and the high level science products on the mast website ]    we used sextractor @xcite in dual - image mode for object detection and photometry . for the detection image we used the wfc3/ir @xmath5  data .",
    "the inverse - variance weight images produced by multidrizzle were used to generate rms maps for each image .",
    "we subsequently normalized the rms maps to account for correlated noise introduced by the drizzling procedure ( see * ? ? ? * ) and used them in sextractor for both source detection and photometry .",
    "sources were required to have at least 9 contiguous pixels , each detected at a threshold of 0.7@xmath78 above the background .",
    "object colors and signal - to - noise values were measured using isophotal magnitudes ( isomag ) and total magnitudes were measured within scalable kron apertures ( automag ) .",
    "the photometry in each field has been corrected for galactic extinction using the @xcite dust maps .",
    "all measurements given in this paper include this correction , which is typically modest @xmath79 because the survey primarily targets lines of sight at high galactic latitudes .",
    "we searched for @xmath58 galaxies using a @xmath3-dropout selection criteria in two broadband colors .",
    "the general criteria are a strong break between the @xmath3  and @xmath5  filters , a relatively blue or flat @xmath80  color , and a non - detection in the optical @xmath68  ( or @xmath81 ) band .",
    "specifically , following @xcite we require :    @xmath82 . \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these criteria select galaxies with redshifts in the range @xmath83 ( see section  [ sect : uvlf ] ) . to minimize the probability of contamination of our sample by low - redshift interlopers",
    ", we impose a conservative non - detection threshold of @xmath84 on the optical - band data .",
    "the non - detection in the optical @xmath85 band is fundamental to produce a clean sample of @xmath8 candidates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if a source is not detected in a given filter , we set its magnitude to the corresponding @xmath86 upper limit to calculate its colors . for our final catalog ,",
    "we require sources to be detected with a signal - to - noise ( @xmath87 ) threshold of @xmath88 in @xmath5  and @xmath89 in @xmath6 , as measured in isophotal apertures ( isomag ) .",
    "for the bright @xmath90 catalog , we require sources to be detected with a signal - to - noise threshold of @xmath91 in @xmath5  and @xmath92 in @xmath6 .    using these color criteria",
    ", we identified 33 relatively bright @xmath3-dropout galaxy candidates with observed @xmath5  band magnitudes between @xmath9 and @xmath10 mag over our 274  arcmin@xmath44 search area .",
    "eight of these @xmath8 lbg candidates are brighter than @xmath93 mag and are detected at a significance level of @xmath45 in @xmath5 .",
    "this is the largest sample of bright ( @xmath11 ) @xmath8 galaxies presented to date .",
    "we list the properties of the candidates in the @xmath90 and @xmath76 catalogs in tables  [ tbl:8sig ] and [ tbl:5sig ] , respectively .",
    "the postage - stamp cutout images of the eight @xmath90 candidates are shown in figures  [ fig : stamps1 ] and [ fig : stamps2 ] .",
    "the ( @xmath94 ) and ( @xmath80 ) colors of our @xmath8 candidates along with the color - color selection criteria are illustrated in figure  [ fig : colcol ] .",
    "we also show the expected colors of galaxies simulated over a wide range of redshifts and also those of low - mass dwarf stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; holwerda et al .",
    "2012 ( in prep ) ) . as figure",
    "[ fig : colcol ] shows , our conservative @xmath95 color criterion is effective in minimizing contamination from cool dwarf stars and low - redshift interlopers .",
    "in this paper we employ an improved data reduction that includes laplacian filtering ( see section  [ sect : obs ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect some photometric scatter within the measurement uncertainty with respect to the previous catalogs of @xmath3  dropouts published in @xcite . indeed , this is the case : one of the four bright dropouts identified in @xcite , source `` borg1k '' , is now just marginally out of the catalog with @xmath96 .",
    "this is not surprising , as that candidate was at the edge of the selection window in the previous photometry and we were already considering it likely ( @xmath97 ) to be a contaminant that scattered into the dropout selection ( see section  5.2 in @xcite ) . while it was , and still is , uncertain whether this source is at @xmath8 , our artificial source recovery simulations ( see section  [ sect : uvlf ] ) take photometric scatter into account when determining the effective volume of the survey , making the derivation of the luminosity function robust .    with the new data reduction we also verified the photometry for field borg58 ( here borg_@xmath98 ) , where we identified a @xmath8 protocluster candidate @xcite",
    "the improved photometry confirms the previous measurements , although we note that two of the fainter @xmath8 candidates have scattered out of our current catalog . in this new reduction and catalog , they are detected in the @xmath5band at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , slightly below our formal threshold of @xmath76 detections ( see table  [ tbl : borg58 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that two new @xmath3-dropout sources are also detected in this field , just below the detection threshold , at @xmath101 in @xmath5 , providing circumstantial evidence that the overdensity extends to fainter luminosities in line with our theoretical and numerical predictions @xcite .",
    "deeper _ hst _  imaging would be very useful to further investigate the nature of this overdensity .",
    "while two additional candidates pass our @xmath90 selection criteria ( see table  [ tbl : other ] ) , we exclude them from our final catalog .",
    "one of these sources ( borg_0240@xmath1021857_392 ) is extremely compact and clearly unresolved . given its compactness , the likely explanation is that source is a galactic star with either a significant fluctuation in the photometric measurement or with an unusually red @xmath103 intrinsic color ( at the @xmath104 level ) . because this object is located right above the galactic center ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) , the source is most likely a reddened l or t dwarf star .",
    "an exciting , but much less likely , alternative would be a @xmath8 qso , although the limited area of borg implies that this occurs with @xmath107 based on the @xcite qso luminosity function predictions .",
    "the other source we excluded ( borg_1632@xmath1083737_386 ) is extremely bright at 25.1 ab mag in the @xmath5  band and located immediately adjacent ( sextractor extraction flag `` 2 '' ) to an even brighter ( @xmath109 mag ) foreground spiral galaxy .",
    "the spiral galaxy is tidally interacting with a second spiral and has colors similar to the dropout candidate ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) , but it is clearly detected in @xmath68 . in principle , the @xmath3-dropout could have been lensed ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but because of the similar colors with the foreground source , we consider it much more likely that this dropout is part of the foreground system , with its @xmath5-band photometry partially contaminated by emission - line flux ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a @xmath68  continuum that can not be detected in the current data assuming its @xmath113 is similar to that of the spiral galaxy .",
    "we derive the completeness , @xmath114 , and magnitude - dependent redshift selection function , @xmath115 , of our dataset from simulations as described in @xcite . briefly",
    ", artificial galaxies with a range of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , luminosities , redshifts , and sizes are added to the real images .",
    "we then rerun our detection and selection procedure on the data in each individual field to determine both @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( see figure  [ fig : szm ] ) .",
    "the simulations are based on @xmath116 galaxy images rescaled to the desired input magnitude and to higher redshift using standard evolutionary relations . in particular",
    "we use a size scaling of @xmath117 as determined from lbgs in the range @xmath118 @xcite and adopt a uv - continuum slope distribution of @xmath119 , motivated by the recent measurements at @xmath120 @xcite . from these simulations",
    "we derive the effective volume for our @xmath8 selection as a function of @xmath5magnitude as shown in figure  [ fig : effvol ] . by design these simulations",
    "take into account the reduction of the effective area and volume probed by the survey because of photometric scatter and presence of foreground sources , including any persistence images in the @xmath3  data .",
    "we also note that because we are selecting sources from the @xmath5  images , the @xmath121 color is not an unbiased measure of the rest - frame uv slope @xmath122 , so the simulations we perform are crucial to derive the effective volume of our selection , and show that we retain high efficiency , with @xmath123 ( figure  [ fig : effvol ] ) .",
    "we construct the stepwise luminosity function from our borg observations in @xmath42 mag bins for the sample of all @xmath124 @xmath3-dropouts and for the smaller , but more robust , sample of @xmath125 sources with high @xmath87 ( @xmath126 ) detections .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tbl : swlf ] and figure  [ fig : uvlf ] and take into account @xmath127 contamination for the @xmath128 sample and @xmath129 contamination for the @xmath130 sample based on improved estimates following @xcite .",
    "we take into account the contamination levels of the legacy fields following @xcite and estimate the borg contamination rate by using the early release science ( ers ) wfc3/ir data @xcite , which also used the f098 m filter as the @xmath131 band , in combination with the goods f606w data degraded to match our relative @xmath68  and @xmath3  depths .",
    "the main limitation of this approach is the limited area of the ers data , which is a factor @xmath132 smaller than the borg area .",
    "also , we assume that contamination does not vary as a function of luminosity for a given dataset , which is the working assumption of previous studies deriving the lf at high redshift , both in legacy and pure - parallel fields . in principle",
    ", the contamination might vary with source brightness , depending on the lf difference for contaminants and @xmath8 galaxies with the same near - ir colors . without a spectroscopic follow - up survey , and given the lack of confirmed @xmath8 galaxies even in legacy surveys @xcite , it is challenging , if at all possible , to investigate this in more detail .",
    "yet , it is reassuring that the spectra of the two borg @xmath8 candidates that have been observed at keck with nircam by @xcite and @xcite allow us to exclude the scenario where these sources are @xmath133 galaxies with strong emission lines , which are expected to be the main contaminants of our selection ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    to explore the effect of contamination in borg",
    ", we performed the experiment of leaving the contamination fraction as a free parameter in the lf fit , as discussed below ( see table  [ tbl : contam ] ) .",
    "a different contamination fraction would , under our assumptions , simply scale up or down the borg lf measurement .",
    "shifting up our data by @xmath134 dex , assuming no contamination , can be interpreted very conservatively as an upper limit to the bright end of the @xmath8 galaxy luminosity function . as figure",
    "[ fig : uvlf ] shows , the low- and high-@xmath87 samples provide a consistent determination of the luminosity function of @xmath3  dropouts in the borg dataset and the data in our faintest bins agree with ( and are actually slightly lower than ) the brightest bins in @xcite from ers and hudf09 data .",
    "finally , the measure of a strong clustering signal from the borg survey argues against a strong contamination fraction @xcite .",
    "we derive schechter function parameters by performing a maximum - likelihood fit to the data , assuming a poisson distribution of the galaxy number counts in each magnitude bin .",
    "specifically , we maximize the poisson likelihood for observing @xmath135 sources in a given magnitude bin when @xmath136 are expected to be observed from a given schechter lf .",
    "the likelihood @xmath137 is expressed as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the poisson probability distribution and the products are taken over all the fields , @xmath140 , and magnitude bins , @xmath141 . to establish the best estimate of the overall shape of the uv lf",
    ", we combine our borg dataset with those from the deeper ers+hudf09 data of @xcite , providing the largest dynamic range in luminosity currently possible .",
    "given that the candels observations yield very different preliminary results depending on the team that analyzed the data to search for @xmath8 galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we exclude those data from our analysis .    at @xmath13 confidence , for @xmath14 we derive @xmath15 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and a very steep faint - end slope @xmath18 . as observed in figure  [ fig : uvlf ] , overall the best fit provides a very good description of the data .",
    "the covariance in the parameter values is smaller than that in the candels+ers+hudf analysis by @xcite ( @xcite do not fit a lf to their data ) , but it is still significant , as shown in figure  [ fig : lfparam ] . from this figure",
    "it is also clearly evident that our @xmath20  versus @xmath30 parameter values have much better constraints than previous studies at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "formally the bright end of the luminosity function has a marginally low @xmath142 value .",
    "however , this is compensated by the low @xmath19 such that the best - fit schechter function ( @xmath143  mpc@xmath144 ) derived by @xcite is fully consistent with our determination at @xmath13 confidence .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : uvlf ] , the faintest three bins of the borg dataset match very closely the brightest bins in @xcite .",
    "the latest borg lf is also very similar to our earlier fit from @xcite , where we had kept @xmath19 and @xmath30 fixed ( see table  [ tbl : lfparam ] ) .",
    "table  [ tbl : contam ] shows the impact of varying the contamination fraction @xmath145 for the borg dataset and its associated contamination correction @xmath146 that is applied to the intrinsic counts per magnitude bin to obtain the estimated observed counts .",
    "the table shows that the impact of contamination around our fiducial value @xmath147 is relatively modest .",
    "we note that the highest likelihood is associated to a contamination fraction just below our fiducial value , providing indirect evidence to suggest that our derived contamination fraction is robust . varying the contamination fraction around @xmath148 has almost no impact on the determination of @xmath20 , as the lf is well sampled by the borg data in this luminosity range , but affects mostly @xmath30 ; if we have underestimated @xmath145 , then the faint - end slope would be even steeper .",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl : lfparam ] , our determination of the @xmath8 luminosity function is consistent with previous work @xcite , taking into account the significant uncertainties in all these measures .",
    "formally , our best fit prefers a low normalization for @xmath19 and a brighter @xmath20 ( similar to the @xmath23 value ) , but the covariance between these parameters is very large ( see figure  [ tbl : lfparam ] ) .",
    "in particular our borg+ers+hudf lf fit provides a better constraint on the @xmath20vs .",
    "@xmath30 parameter uncertainties than the candels+ers+hudf determination at @xmath8 @xcite .    in comparing different datasets ,",
    "it is important to note that the bright end is still sparsely sampled ; for example , the brightest borg magnitude bin includes only one source .",
    "therefore , small - number fluctuations are very significant and poisson noise in the brightest bins can have a large impact on the fit",
    ". however , our maximum likelihood fit shows , independent of the @xmath20 versus @xmath19 degeneracy , that the faint - end slope @xmath30 is being constrained with growing accuracy . of note , we reduce its @xmath86 uncertainty at @xmath8 to @xmath149 and show in figure  [ fig : alpha ] that the steepening trend suggested by previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also supported by our lf fit .",
    "the steep faint - end slope derived in our best - fit lf implies that faint galaxies are playing a key role as major producers of ionizing photons . for a schechter lf ,",
    "most of the luminosity density contribution is at the faint end ( e.g. , see left panel of fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in the case of @xmath150 , there is a logarithmically divergent contribution from sources below the detection limit of the survey .",
    "this implies that the total ionizing flux produced by galaxies is sensitive to the exact measure of @xmath30 ( as well as on the extrapolation beyond the detection limit ) , as shown , for example , in the left panel of fig . 4 of @xcite .",
    "assuming that star formation continues to be efficient in lower luminosity galaxies down to @xmath151 at @xmath0 ( the limit of atomic hydrogen cooling halos , e.g. see @xcite ) , then we expect that the current _ hst _",
    "observations are only observing @xmath152 of the light present at @xmath153 . a direct proof that we are detecting only the tip of the iceberg of star formation during the epoch of reionization",
    "is provided by _ hst",
    "_  observations of high - redshift , spectroscopically confirmed grbs that have failed to detect host galaxies despite reaching ultrafaint sensitivity ( @xmath154 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the non - detection of galaxies at locations in the sky where it is confirmed that star formation is happening ( because a grb explosion has occurred ) implies that @xmath155 galaxies were indeed the main ionizing sources @xcite , in full agreement with the interpretation of the lf fit derived in this paper .",
    "interestingly , our determination of the @xmath8 luminosity function at the bright end is between the debated measurements from the candels dataset obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , our data clearly show a well - behaved schechter function , similar to @xcite , without the unusual shape derived by @xcite . our lf determination and",
    "that by @xcite are consistent at the @xmath104 level .",
    "the observed differences could be partially related to the environment ( i.e. cosmic variance @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discuss that the ers measurement by @xcite could have been affected by an overdensity .",
    "however , given that the borg dataset is not affected by cosmic variance and agrees with @xcite , it may well be that the candels - south field is underdense , which would explain the lower @xmath20 value derived from that dataset .",
    "the upcoming borg observations and those in the candels - north field will help clarify the nature of the discrepancy and provide further improvements to the determination of the bright end of the @xmath8 luminosity function .",
    "we present the discovery of 33 lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) candidates at @xmath8 detected in _",
    "hst_/wfc3 imaging as part of the brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) pure - parallel survey .",
    "our sample of bright @xmath3-dropout galaxy candidates have @xmath5-band magnitudes between @xmath9 and @xmath10 mag , obtained from @xmath156 independent lines of sight over a total area of @xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 .",
    "the pure - parallel nature of borg allows us to obtain an estimate of the galaxy luminosity function which is unaffected by large - scale structure uncertainty and distinct from determinations using legacy surveys limited to a single , or a few , contiguous fields .    with our new data we detect galaxies between @xmath157 , demonstrating the bright end of the @xmath8 luminosity function",
    "is well described by a schechter form , similar to that found at lower redshifts .",
    "our measurement of the number density of galaxies near the borg detection limit ( @xmath158 ) is in agreement with the results by @xcite .",
    "their measurement is based on ers+hudf09 observations that extend to much fainter luminosities , but they lack the area to detect the brighter galaxies at @xmath159 we identify in the borg survey .",
    "the two datasets are complementary and allow us to obtain the best determination yet of the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath8 , with @xmath160 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath161 for @xmath14 .",
    "covariance in the parameters , albeit reduced thanks to the increase in the dynamic range of the fit , is still very significant . however , this affects primarily @xmath20  versus @xmath19 .",
    "we find that our borg+ers+hudf lf fit provides a better constraint on the @xmath20  versus @xmath30 parameter uncertainties than the candels+ers+hudf determination at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the faint - end slope uncertainty is starting to be reduced to a point where there is a hint of steepening compared to @xmath162 .",
    "this steepening is expected based on numerical and theoretical models of galaxy formation in the epoch of reionization @xcite . as a consequence of this large abundance of faint galaxies",
    ", it is expected that such systems will dominate the total star formation rate and ionizing photon production @xcite , which has recently been confirmed observationally by the non - detection of host galaxies in a sample of six @xmath163 gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "our determination of a steep @xmath30 for a schechter fit of the lf is robust against our estimate of the contamination fraction of the borg survey ( @xmath147 for the @xmath76 sample ) ; as shown in table  [ tbl : contam ] , if @xmath145 were higher , @xmath30 would be steeper . in the near future ,",
    "the upcoming ultradeep observations of go 12498 ( pi ellis ) will improve the determination of the number density of the faintest galaxies observable by _ hst _ , while scheduled borg and candels - north observations will further increase the search area for the brightest galaxies at @xmath8 , allowing us to further tighten the constrains on the lf .",
    "the @xmath8 candidates identified here are good targets for follow - up observations from ground and space observatories .",
    "we have started a spectroscopic campaign to confirm their redshift , to measure the distribution of ly@xmath30 equivalent width ( which is related to the igm ionization state ) , and also to rule out contamination from emission - line galaxies at @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "the availability of multi - object spectrographs both on keck ( mosfire ) and gemini south ( flamingos-2 ) , will enable faster progress , especially in fields that have overdensities of sources similar to the protocluster candidate we reported in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the brightest borg sources are expected to have star formation rates of @xmath164  @xmath165  @xmath54  based on their rest - frame uv luminosity , making them prime targets for alma observations as they are expected to fall well within the telescope sensitivity based on the @xcite predictions .",
    "if these candidates are spectroscopically confirmed , this would allow us to possibly extend the detection of  158  @xmath166 m , high-@xmath167 co emission lines , and perhaps dust emission as well , to @xmath8 , after the recent record established at @xmath168 from a qso host galaxy @xcite . finally , _",
