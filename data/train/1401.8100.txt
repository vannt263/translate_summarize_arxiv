    "the nature of the jamming transition in granular systems has been investigated during the last decade , see recent reviews @xcite .",
    "many studies have focused on frictionless discs or spheres , typically controlled in volume fraction @xmath3 or in pressure @xmath4 @xcite , showing that the jamming transition is critical ( scaling exponents , diverging length scale ) @xcite and related to isostaticity @xcite . as the system loses its mechanical rigidity at the transition , its shear modulus @xmath5",
    "is found to vanish as a power law with respect to the distance to jamming @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the critical volume fraction .",
    "the properties of frictional granular packings have also been investigated , see e.g. @xcite , but , in this context of elastic properties close to jamming , most of the studies have considered homogeneous systems under isotropic pressure @xcite . in the frictional case , the liu - nagel jamming concept @xcite must be revised @xcite . in particular , jamming and isostatic points do not coincide any more @xcite , and one thus can expect a finite shear modulus at the transition .    in this paper , we consider static layers of frictional grains under gravity , by means of two - dimensional discrete element simulations ( standard molecular dynamics @xcite ) , and investigate their mechanical properties through the analysis of their stress response to a localized overload @xmath8 at the layer surface , a technique particularly developed by and dear to r.p .",
    "behringer , see e.g. @xcite . expanding the work published in @xcite , we present here the detailed analysis of layers prepared with three different protocols .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "we first describe the numerical system , its preparation and the computation of the stress response . in the next section",
    ", we present an orthotropic elastic analysis of the stress profiles , and detail the fitting procedure .",
    "then , a section is devoted to the measure and the interpretation of the microscopic data .",
    "finally , conclusions and perspectives are drawn .",
    "the numerical model is that described in @xcite , with @xmath9 polydisperse frictional discs coupled , when overlapping , by normal and tangential linear springs , tangential forces being limited by the coulomb condition with a friction coefficient @xmath10",
    ". the typical thickness of the layer is @xmath11 grain diameters , i.e. a system aspect ratio around @xmath12 .",
    "the layers are prepared at a _ fixed _",
    "angle @xmath0 with respect to the horizontal ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ] for notations ) , and unjamming is approached as @xmath0 is close to @xmath1 , the critical value above which static layers can not be equilibrated at that angle and always flow .",
    "note that this unjamming point @xmath1 is close in spirit to the situation of a jammed solid sheared up to its yield - stress  @xcite .",
    "it is also close , but different , to progressively tilted granular layers , which eventually loose their mechanical stability , see e.g. , @xcite .    in our simulations ,",
    "the volume fraction in the layer is fairly uniform all through the layer depth and roughly independent on the inclination angle .",
    "the control parameter for the jamming / unjamming transition is then the sole angle @xmath0 .",
    "this situation is therefore qualitatively different to the homogeneous configurations submitted to isotropic pressure cited above , and is effectively closer to an experimental set - up . no external pressure applied to the topmost layer of particles ,",
    "i.e. the pressure in the system is due solely to the gravitational force acting on the particles themselves .     is the horizontal axis .",
    "@xmath13 is the vertical one , along which acts gravity @xmath14 .",
    "the granular layer ( here gg preparation ) , of average thickness @xmath15 , is inclined at an angle @xmath0 with respect to horizontal .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the axis respectively tangential and normal to the layer .",
    "a localized force @xmath18 , which makes an angle @xmath19 with respect to @xmath17 , is applied on a grain close to the surface of the layer .",
    "the stress responses @xmath20 and @xmath21 to this overload are measured at the bottom of the layer ( fixed grains in white ) .",
    "axis @xmath22 , making an angle @xmath23 with respect to @xmath24 , are those of the orthotropic elastic analysis .",

    "red line : coordination number profile @xmath26 .",
    "these are for the gg preparation .",
    "orangish colors on grains : force chains . ]",
    "three different system preparations have been carried out : a grain - by - grain ( gg ) , a rain - like ( rl ) and an avalanched ( av ) deposition of the particles on a rough substrate consisting of fixed but size - distributed particles , inclined at the desired angle @xmath0 . in the gg protocol , grains are added to the layer one after the other , with no initial velocity , at random @xmath16-positions and in contact with those already deposited .",
    "the time lag between two successive drops is sufficiently large to ensure the relaxation of the system before the next deposit . as for the rl preparation ,",
    "all @xmath27 grains are initially put at regular ` flying ' positions above the bed , with no contact between the particles and no velocity .",
    "then gravity is switched on , and they all fall down like a rain . finally , for the av preparation , we start from an initial steady and homogeneous flow running at a large inclination , then abruptly set the angle to the desired value of @xmath0 and reduce the kinetic energy of the whole system . the layer is prepared when all grains have eventually reached static equilibrium ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "above a certain inclination @xmath1 , these preparation procedures do not converge towards a static layer ",
    "the grains do not stop moving .",
    "the ` solid - liquid ' transition occurs rather abruptly , over a typical inclination range @xmath28 where only part of the simulations converge .",
    "this allows for a value of this critical angle defined at this precision . for both gg and av preparations ,",
    "we get @xmath29 .",
    "we have not studied systematically enough the rl preparation for inclinations around @xmath30 to determine its critical angle with a good precision .",
    "however , we expect rl and av data to be very similar close to @xmath1 as in both cases the grains flow down the slope over long distances  typically several times the system size  before stoping , so that the initial configuration is effectively forgotten .",
    ".values of the elastic parameters corresponding to the fits displayed in fig .",
    "[ stressprofiles ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these three preparations mainly differ in their contact orientation ( see fig .",
    "[ microdata ] ) .",
    "their volume fractions does not vary much from @xmath31 to @xmath1 .",
    "typical values are @xmath32 for gg and @xmath33 for rl and av .",
    "these are slightly larger than  or similar to  the critical value , estimated in our system at @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "once a layer is deposited , stabilized in an equilibrium state , an additional force @xmath8 is applied on a grain close to the free surface , and a new equilibrium state is reached .",
    "taking the difference between the states after and before the overload , one can compute the contact forces in response to @xmath8 . introducing a coarse graining length @xmath35",
    ", the corresponding stress response can be determined .",
    "taking @xmath35 of the order of few mean grain diameters ( here @xmath36 ) as well as an ensemble averaging of the data ( here , for each tilt angle @xmath0 , we average over @xmath37@xmath38 independent force loads , distributed on typically @xmath39 layers in total ) , make the stress profiles quantitatively comparable to a continuum theory @xcite , such as elasticity , as discussed below .",
    "the amplitude of the overload was kept constant for all simulations : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the average mass of the grains .",
    "this value is sufficiently small to ensure a linear @xcite and reversible response of the system for all values of @xmath0 , including close to @xmath1",
    ".    some examples of stress bottom profiles @xmath42 and @xmath43 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ stressprofiles ] for different values of the inclination @xmath0 and of the angle @xmath19 that the overload force makes with the normal direction ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "note that , as we deal with linear elasticity , the stresses can be rescaled by @xmath44 .",
    "the normal stress data @xmath20 show classical bell - shaped profiles , which do not differ much for all three preparations when the layer is horizontal ( @xmath45 ) and the overload vertical ( @xmath46 ) , see panel ( a ) . however , on can distinguish between the preparations , especially gg from the two others , looking at the shear stress profiles @xmath21 in response to a non - normal overload force ( @xmath47 ) , see panel ( b ) . the difference between gg and av profiles",
    "is enhanced for the data at an inclination close to @xmath1 , see panel ( c ) .",
    "experimental and numerical works have shown that the linear stress response of granular systems to a point force is well described by ( possibly anisotropic ) elasticity @xcite . in this section",
    ", we introduce the framework of orthotropic elasticity , with which numerical response profiles such as those displayed in fig .",
    "[ stressprofiles ] can be fitted .",
    "the details of the computation of elastic response are available in appendix  [ orthotropic ] .",
    "orthotropic elasticity is characterized by a stiff axis ( here labelled @xmath48 ) and a soft one ( labelled @xmath49 ) , associated to two young moduli @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and to two poisson coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( note that , for symmetry reasons , @xmath54 ) .",
    "there is also a shear modulus @xmath5 involved in the corresponding relation between stress and strain tensor components ( eq .  [ wdagger ] ) .",
    "a last parameter of this modeling is the angle @xmath23 that the axes @xmath22 make with @xmath24 ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "orthotropic stress responses to a point force @xmath18 have been analytically computed in @xcite for a semi - infinite medium ( @xmath55 ) . for a given @xmath23",
    ", they only depend on two combinations of the elastic parameters , noted @xmath56 and @xmath57 , ( eq .",
    "[ deftandr ] ) . for an elastic slab of finite layer thickness @xmath15 , a semi - analytical integration , following the computation performed in @xcite for isotropic elasticity , must be done ( see appendix  [ orthotropic ] ) .",
    "rough bottom boundary conditions ( zero displacement ) are imposed .",
    "besides the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 , these bottom conditions involve a poisson coefficient , say @xmath53 , so that , in total , five dimensionless numbers ( @xmath23 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath53 and @xmath19 ) must be specified to produce the normalized bottom stress responses @xmath58 as functions of the reduced tangential coordinate @xmath59 .",
    "the idea is to fit the elastic response profiles to the numerical data , in order to extract the effective elastic parameters of the layer . for a given inclination @xmath0 ,",
    "the four numbers @xmath23 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath53 must be adjusted to reproduce at the same time the profiles measured for all three stress components @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath60 , and for all overload angles @xmath19 .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing the rms difference @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of data points in the profiles , and @xmath63 is the standard deviation around the mean stress computed from the ensemble averaging .",
    "an example of a contour plot of @xmath64 in the ( @xmath65 ) plane , for given @xmath23 and @xmath53 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fittingtechnique]a .",
    "there is a clear deepest point , which corresponds to the best fit . in fig .",
    "[ fittingtechnique]b , we display @xmath64 as a function of the orthotropic angle @xmath23 , each point of these curves corresponding to the best fitting @xmath56,@xmath57 and @xmath53 .",
    "these curves have been computed for the gg data at different inclination angles .",
    "it shows how the minimum , corresponding to the best fitting @xmath23 , changes rather abruptly from @xmath66 to @xmath67 around @xmath68 ( see also next section and fig .",
    "[ microdata]c ) .",
    "some of these fits are displayed in fig .",
    "[ stressprofiles ] , for various angles @xmath0 and @xmath19 , and for the different preparations .",
    "the overall agreement between the elastic predictions and the numerical data is quantitatively good . in fig .",
    "[ shearyoungmoduli ] , we show the elastic modulus ratios @xmath69 and @xmath70 extracted from these fits , as function of the inclination .",
    "@xmath69 decreases with @xmath0 but does not vanish close to the critical angle , in agreement with the observation that frictional granular systems remain hyperstatic at the unjamming transition @xcite .",
    "such a discontinuous behaviour at the transition has also been seen in simulations by otsuki and hayakawa @xcite investigating the rheology of sheared frictional grains close to jamming , and in experimentally created shear - jammed states reported in @xcite .",
    "the sudden drop of @xmath69 around @xmath68 is associated with the change of the orthotropic directions mentioned above .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath70 also present an overall decrease with @xmath0 , except for the av data close to @xmath1 .",
    "the complete interpretation of this behavior of the av data is not entirely clear , but it is clearly related to an increase of friction mobilization at the contacts ( see figs .",
    "[ microdata ] and [ contactsglissants ] and discussion below ) .",
    "in addition to the above global mechanical properties of the system , we have studied the evolution of various microscopic quantities with @xmath0 .",
    "the first one of interest is the coordination number @xmath71 , i.e. the average number of contacts per grain , here computed in the bulk of the layer , where it is fairly uniform ",
    "it obviously drops down close to the surface . @xmath71",
    "monotonously decreases with @xmath0 for the gg preparation , while it stays approximately constant for rl and av data ( fig .",
    "[ microdata]a ) . in all cases",
    ", it stays always far from the isostatic value @xmath72 ( for frictional grains in 2d ) .",
    "grains of the bulk that only carry their own weight do not contribute much to the global stability of the contact network .",
    "as for so - called rattlers in gravity - free packings ( see @xcite , chap .",
    "6 ) , these grains can be removed from the contact counting , leading to a modified coordination number of the layer @xmath73 ( see fig .  [",
    "microdata]a ) . however , we find that their number is roughly independent of @xmath0 .",
    "we have also studied the friction mobilisation at the contact level . in the md simulations , the number of contacts with a ratio of the tangential force @xmath74 to the normal force @xmath75 strictly equal to the microscopic friction @xmath76 is zero when static equilibrium is reached .",
    "however , some of them are effectively close to the coulomb criterion .",
    "we have first computed the average @xmath77 .",
    "this quantity , displayed in fig .",
    "[ microdata]a , increases as @xmath2 for all three preparations , but its overall variation is weaker for the gg data ( see right @xmath78-scales ) , as could be expected .",
    "more precisely , we also display in fig .",
    "[ contactsglissants]a , b the probability distribution function of of the friction mobilisation at contact for the two preparations gg and av , and for several inclinations . for the gg preparation ,",
    "the distribution is only slightly skewed towards larger values of @xmath79 when @xmath0 in increased , but nothing particular happens close to @xmath80 . for the av preparation , however , a peak close to @xmath80 appears for @xmath81 , corresponding to quasi - sliding contacts .",
    "[ contactsglissants]d shows that they are uniformly distributed all through the layer depth .",
    "following @xcite , we have computed the redundancy factor @xmath82 , i.e. the ratio of the total number of force degrees of freedom at contacts over the number of equilibrium equations , taking into account these quasi - sliding contacts : @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the total number of contacts and @xmath85 is the number of quasi - sliding contacts  recall the system is two - dimensional .",
    "we see that @xmath82 decreases with @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ contactsglissants]c ) , and , for the av preparation , approaches @xmath48 ( the isostatic value ) , though remaining above this value at @xmath1 .    finally , we have studied contact angle distributions .",
    "three of these distributions are represented as polar diagrams for @xmath45 , @xmath39 and @xmath86 ( or @xmath87 for rl ) degrees in fig .",
    "[ microdata]b .",
    "let us first comment the gg data .",
    "the four strongly pronounced lobes are typical of this preparation @xcite ( chap . 6 ) .",
    "the vertical and horizontal directions are always in between these lobes .",
    "when the layer is horizontal ( @xmath31 ) , the orthotropic stiff and soft directions are also found to be ( almost ) along the horizontal and vertical axis respectively .",
    "note that the fitting procedure effectively gives here @xmath88 in this case , while @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) would have been expected for symmetry reasons .",
    "this effectively indicates the typical precision we have on the measure of this orthotropic angle .",
    "close to the critical slope , however , the orthotropic orientations are close to those of the lobes , the stiff one being in the direction of the slope .",
    "as evidenced in fig.[microdata]c , the transition between these two microscopic configurations occurs around @xmath68 , i.e. well below @xmath1 , in correspondence with the drop of @xmath69 between @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "[ shearyoungmoduli ] ) .",
    "the polar distributions computed with rl and av data are more isotropic than in the gg case ( fig .",
    "[ microdata]b ) . however ,",
    "although the lobes are less pronounced , the overall behaviour of the rl data is similar to the gg ones . in the av case , the orthotropic direction roughly follows that of the lobes over the all range of inclination .",
    "to sum up , we have simulated 2d frictional and polydisperse granular layers under gravity inclined at an angle @xmath0 , and investigated their mechanical and microscopic properties when the unjamming transition is approached .",
    "this work tells us what to expect in real experiments , i.e. a layer that becomes elastically softer as @xmath2 , as e.g. inferred from acoustic experiments on a granular packing in the vicinity of the transition @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the shear modulus @xmath5 and the stiff young modulus @xmath50 both decrease with respect to the soft modulus @xmath93 , but not to the point at which the system would loose its rigidity before avalanching . in particular , as evidenced by the comparison of the curves in figures  [ shearyoungmoduli ] and [ microdata]a , the shear modulus is not found to be a linear function of @xmath94 ( or @xmath95 ) , in contrast with the finding of @xcite on homogeneous frictional systems , close to isostaticity . in fact , in agreement with the analysis of @xcite , the idea that the whole granular layer reaches the isostatic limit at the critical angle @xmath1 is too simple because it ignores the anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the packing induced by the preparation and the gravity field .",
    "interestingly , in the simple shear geometry considered in @xcite , the redundancy factor @xmath82 does tend to @xmath48 when the critical state is reached , but here remains ( slightly ) above this value for the avalanched layers , even though some ( quasi ) sliding contacts appear .",
    "as for perspectives , similarly to what we did for the gg layers in @xcite , one should compute the vibration modes for the av layers , taking into account the presence of these quasi - sliding contacts .",
    "also , it could be interesting to use granular simulations with a rolling resistance @xcite in order to explore a wider range of @xmath3 , @xmath71 and @xmath0 .",
