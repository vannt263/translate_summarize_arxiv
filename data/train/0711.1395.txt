    "braneworld models with large extra dimensions  @xcite bring us an interesting possibility to address the hierarchy problem by lowering the fundamental scale of gravity down to order of tev .",
    "it has been argued in the context of tev scale gravity that mini black holes might be created through high - energy particle collision at future colliders  @xcite .",
    "much effort has been directed towards a theoretical understanding of the black hole formation at tev energies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "after their production , the black holes will decay via hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "this process provides a window to probe high - energy physics , gravity at small distances , and properties of extra dimensions , which motivates recent extensive studies on this topic .",
    "a nonexhaustive sampling of the literature can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . for",
    "a review see ref .",
    "most of the related work to date has ignored the effect of brane tension , treating black holes as `` isolated '' ones ( see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite for the effects of self - gravity of branes ) .",
    "it is in general very difficult to obtain a black hole solution localized on a brane with finite tension because tension curves the brane as well as the bulk ( cf",
    "however , codimension-2 branes exceptionally allow for a simple construction of localized black holes thanks to their special property ; starting from the myers - perry solution  @xcite one rescales the polar angle around a symmetry axis as @xmath0 and then the brane tension is proportional to the deficit angle @xmath1 . in this way both nonrotating  @xcite and rotating  @xcite black holes on codimension-2 branes have been constructed . following the work of  @xcite , hawking evaporation  @xcite and",
    "the quasi - normal modes for bulk scalars  @xcite and fermions  @xcite have been investigated in the nonrotating background , showing that the finite brane tension modifies the standard result derived assuming negligible tension .    in this paper",
    ", we shall consider a six - dimensional _ rotating _ black hole pierced by a tense 3-brane and discuss the emission of massless scalar fields into the bulk .",
    "we intend to shed light on the spin - down phase in the life of a black hole , which is often neglected in the literature but could be of some significance .",
    "( in fact , a rotating black hole does not necessarily spin - down to zero , but evolves toward a nonzero angular momentum  @xcite . ) ignoring the brane tension , very recently creek _ et al .",
    "_ studied the emission of scalars in the bulk in a higher - dimensional rotating black hole background  @xcite .",
    "they employed matching techniques to obtain an analytic solution to the scalar field equation , which is a good approximation in the low - energy ( @xmath2 ) and slow - rotation ( @xmath3 ) regime , where @xmath4 is the energy of the emitted particle , @xmath5 is the black hole horizon radius , and @xmath6 is the rotation parameter . in the present paper , with the help of numerical computations we are able to handle the intermediate regime ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , and thus we not only include the effect of the finite tension but also extend the range of validity of  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a quick review of the rotating black hole solution on a codimension-2 brane . in sec .",
    "iii we present separated equations of motion for a massless scalar field and determine angular eigenvalues in the presence of the deficit angle . then in sec .",
    "iv the radial equation is solved numerically to give the power and angular momentum emission spectra .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "v. appendix contains the analytic calculation of the absorption probability , which complements the numerical results presented in the main text .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the rotating black hole solution on a codimension-2 brane .",
    "( for further detail see refs .",
    "the solution shares some properties with the myers - perry black hole @xcite .",
    "we are considering the models with five spatial dimensions , and so the rotation group is @xmath9 .",
    "the number of casimirs ( i.e. , the number of mutually commuting elements of the group ) is equal to rank@xmath10=2 $ ] .",
    "hence , we have two axes of rotation associated with two angular momenta . however , in the present article we will be focusing on the special but simple case of a single rotation parameter with the angular momentum pointing along the brane .",
    "this is indeed an interesting case from the phenomenological point of view , because the black hole formed by the collision of two particles confined to the brane will have a single rotation parameter .",
    "the exact metric that describes such a rotating black hole is given by  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 the coordinate ranges are @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is related to the brane tension @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the six - dimensional fundamental scale .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath20 , the above metric reduces to the usual myers - perry solution with a single rotation parameter in six dimensions  @xcite . when @xmath21 the solution is asymptotically conical",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath6 denote the specific mass and angular momentum , respectively , related to the adm mass and angular momentum of the black hole as @xmath23 where @xmath24 $ ] is the area of a unit @xmath25-sphere .",
    "note here that the effect of the deficit angle @xmath15 is separated out from the definition of the area .",
    "the black hole horizon radius @xmath5 follows from @xmath26 . for later purpose",
    "it is convenient to define the dimensionless measure of the angular momentum @xmath27 . since the sign flip @xmath28 simply changes the direction of rotation , in what follows we will assume @xmath29 without any loss of generality .",
    "note that @xmath30 has a root for arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the four - dimensional kerr black hole , which has an upper bound on the rotation parameter .",
    "this point will become clearer by considering the black hole temperature .",
    "the generator of the horizon is parallel to the killing vector @xmath31 , and the surface gravity of the black hole is given by @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the angular velocity of the horizon : @xmath34 then , the hawking temperature is given by  @xcite @xmath35 and one sees that the temperature never attains zero .",
    "this means the black hole is manifestly nondegenerate for any value of @xmath6 .",
    "an interesting effect of the brane tension perhaps one is immediately aware of is the rescaling of the gravitational scale @xmath36 , as is observed in eq .",
    "( [ mandj ] ) .",
    "this modifies the scenario of the black hole production and evaporation as follows  @xcite .",
    "suppose that a black hole is formed through a particle collision and its mass @xmath37 is fixed by the accelerator .",
    "the upper limit on the impact parameter @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath40 , for fixed @xmath37 the horizon radius is _ larger _ than the naive estimate , @xmath41 , which is called the `` lightning rod '' effect  @xcite . in the present situation producing black holes will become easier due to this effect . since the black hole formed in this way has the angular momentum @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 , and so the angular momentum can also be _ larger _ than naively expected , @xmath44 . now the time scale @xmath45 of mass loss is estimated from @xmath46 ( horizon area)@xmath47 , yielding @xmath48 .",
    "thus the lifetime of the black hole will become longer .",
    "similarly , the time scale @xmath49 of angular momentum loss is estimated roughly from @xmath50 .",
    "this gives @xmath51 , and hence the time scale @xmath49 will also become larger .",
    "the above mentioned modifications are caused by the rescaling of the gravitational scale . in the rest of the paper we separate this effect and discuss the impact of finite brane tension on hawking emission _ with the horizon radius @xmath5 fixed_.",
    "let us finally remark that in models with extra dimensions the bulk will be compact . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the horizon size of the black hole is smaller than the typical compactification scale . with this",
    ", the above solution provides a nice description of a six - dimensional black hole localized on a 3-brane .",
    "we now turn to discuss hawking emission of massless scalar fields . to this end",
    "we solve the equation of motion for a massless scalar field @xmath52 in the rotating black hole background  ( [ bh ] ) .",
    "the governing equation is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "we can separate the above equation by assuming the ansatz @xmath55 where @xmath56 the radial equation is @xmath57r=0 , \\label{radial_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and the angular equations are given by @xmath59s = -\\eta s,&&\\label{ang_s } \\\\",

    "<S> as the rotation parameter increases , the power spectra are reduced at low frequencies due to the smaller hawking temperature and are enhanced at high frequencies due to superradiance . </S>",
    "<S> the angular momentum spectra are enhanced over the whole frequency range as the rotation parameter increases . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra and the amounts of energy and angular momentum radiated away into the bulk are thus determined by the interplay of these effects . </S>"
