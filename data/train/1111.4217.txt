    "the dark matter mass within this fov is not only significantly larger but also subject to less uncertainty both because we exclude the central region of the galaxy , where the dark matter density profile is least well constrained , and because we make use of an updated model of the andromeda dark matter distribution based on more recent kinematic data and theoretical considerations .",

    "although most existing _ chandra _ observations of m31 have been aimed toward the inner bulge , we did find seven observations that were aimed toward the outer bulge / disk regions and were therefore more well - suited for our purposes .",
    "all seven observations used the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) i - array as the primary detector , with a @xmath25x@xmath25 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the positions of these observations relative to an annulus of inner radius 12 arcminutes and outer radius 28 arcminutes ( @xmath26 kpc at @xmath27 @xmath28 mpc @xcite ) are shown in figure  [ acis_fov ] .",
    "five of the seven observations ( obsids 1576 , 1584 , 2899 , 2901 and 2902 ) have effective exposure times of @xmath295 ks , while the other two observations have longer exposure times of 8 ks ( obsid 7067 ) and 20 ks ( obsid 11256 ) , respectively .",
    "each @xmath25x@xmath25 acis - i region covers 11.4% of the @xmath0 annulus , and the non - overlapping parts of these 7 pointings collectively cover @xmath30 .",
    "we address sampling bias later in this section , pointing out that the co - added spectrum from the selected observations provides , if anything , an overestimate of the x - ray emission from the entire @xmath0 annulus .",
    "we obtained and re - processed the archival data using ciao version 4.2 and the corresponding calibration files .",
    "we followed the standard procedure of data reduction , e.g. , as described in ref .",
    "briefly , for each observation , we ( i ) filtered time intervals of high particle background , ( ii ) detected and removed discrete sources , ( iii ) extracted a spectrum for the unresolved x - ray emission in the 0.5 - 8 kev range and generated corresponding instrumental response ( rmf and arf ) files , and ( iv ) extracted a fiducial instrumental background spectrum , using the `` stow background data '' that has been calibrated with the 10 - 12 kev count rate . in a final step , we co - added the seven spectra and generated exposure - weighted response files , using the _",
    "ftool addspec_. such a procedure is appropriate , since the spectra were extracted from nearly identical detector regions .    since the effective area @xmath31 of acis is known to decrease gradually with time , it is important to note that these seven observations were taken over a time span of 9 years . by using a weighted @xmath31 associated with the co -",
    "added spectrum in our analysis below , we are able to gauge the mean sensitivity of the detector over this time interval .",
    "additionally , we note that the degradation of the detector mainly affects energies below 1 kev , and our data set has very little constraining power at these low energies , as we will show .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the observed flux varies modestly among the seven observations , within a factor of 1.5 of the mean values associated with the co - added spectrum .",
    "this is a natural result , since the observations sampled different regions of the outer bulge and the disk .",
    "we note , however , that the sampled regions mostly covered the southeastern half of the disk  where the unresolved x - ray emission is higher than that from the northeaster side , primarily due to the tilt of m31 s galactic plane @xcite .",
    "this sampling bias means that the co - added spectrum we use represents an upper limit on the mean flux within the @xmath0 annulus - precisely what we need to set a robust upper limit on the mass of the sterile neutrino .",

    "the dark matter halo of m31 has been studied extensively .",
    "klypin , zhao and somerville ( kzs ) @xcite , for instance , used a variety of kinematic data to determine its dark matter density profile , @xmath33 .",
    "using more recent data and a more accurate baryonic mass profile , seigar , barth and bullock ( sbb ) @xcite have updated the profile found by kzs .",
    "when we integrate the sbb model of @xmath33 over the volume , @xmath34 , associated with the projection of the chandra fov along the line of sight , we find that the @xmath35 annulus contains : ^fov_dm , m31 ( 0.8 0.08 ) 10 ^ 11 m_mpc^-2 ; + m^fov_dm , m31 ( 0.49 0.05 ) 10 ^ 11 m _ , [ m_dm ] where _ fov = [ sigma ] is the dark matter column density within @xmath36 , and the dark matter mass within @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37 .",
    "( see w06 for further details ) .",
    "in addition to being based on more contemporary data and theoretical considerations , the sbb value for @xmath38 is also more conservative : less than 85% of the kzs estimate for this annulus .",
    "we further note that for our fov , cdm models predict more conservative @xmath38 values than cored , wdm models .",
    "because wdm models are less centrally concentrated than cdm models , they are constrained to predict higher densities at larger radii in order to reach agreement with the total mass of a given halo .",
    "for instance , within the radial limits of our fov ( 2.8 - 6.4 kpc ) , the dark matter density given by the burkert profile for m31 @xcite with the commonly adopted parameter values ( as in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) is @xmath39 higher than that of the kzs profile and @xmath40 higher than that of the sbb profile . therefore , despite the fact we are constraining a wdm candidate in this paper , we chose the sbb profile over a wdm profile in the interest of providing a conservative dark matter mass estimate .",
    "because of _ chandra s  excellent angular resolution , we lose less than 5% of @xmath38 due to the excision of point sources . however , to be conservative , we use only @xmath41 for @xmath42 in eqns .",

    "the diminishing amplitude of sterile neutrino decay signatures at lower energies , @xmath57 ( eqn . [ dn_de_dt_om ] ) further exacerbates this problem .",
    "even with a data set such as ours , with a favorably high ratio of fov dark matter to astrophysical background , prospective sterile neutrino signals become comparable to or dwarfed by atomic line features at energies just below 1.1 kev .    to illustrate this point",

    "we found that this was the case for the ne ix peak at 1.07 kev .",
    "in particular , when we assumed that the ne ix peak was a sterile neutrino decay line superposed on a continuum background characterized by the mean flux values of the bins to the left and right of the peak energy , we found that it was best fit by the decay signature of a 2.13 kev majorana sterile neutrino ( see fig .  [ detection_features ] ) .",
    "this exercise underscores both the spectral resolution and amplitude issues .",
    "if andromeda s dark matter halo were actually composed of 2.13 kev sterile neutrinos , they would produce a decay signature at 1.065 kev , but this is clearly indistinguishable from the 1.07 kev ne ix feature with the detectors aboard _ chandra .",
    "if the sterile neutrinos were of even lower mass , the amplitude of their decay signatures would be dwarfed among the thicket of sub - kev atomic lines , and higher spectral resolution would become indispensible if we were to have any hope of finding them .",
