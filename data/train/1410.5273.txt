    "a wegner estimate is an upper bound on the expected number of eigenvalues in a prescribed energy interval of a finite box schrdinger operator .",
    "the expectation here refers to the potential which is random .",
    "the most studied example in this situation is the so - called alloy - type potential , sometimes also called continuum anderson model , cf .  remark",
    "[ r - nonlinearity ] below .",
    "a particular feature of this model is that randomness enters the model via a countable number of random variables , and these random variables influence the potential in a linear way . in the random breather model we study here ,",
    "this dependence is no longer linear but becomes non - linear .",
    "what remains is the monotone dependence of the potential on the random variables .",
    "the topic of the present note is to explain how to effectively use this monotonicity in order to derive a wegner estimate .",
    "this only works if it is possible to cast the monotonicity in a quantitative form .    in order to achieve this",
    ", we use a scale - free uncertainty relation or unique continuation principle for spectral projectors of schrdinger operators , presented in theorem  [ thm : sfuc ] . a proof of theorem  [ thm : sfuc ] will be given in the forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "it answers positively a question raised in @xcite . a partial answer ( for small energy intervals )",
    "had been given shortly after in @xcite .",
    "previously , there has been in the literature on random operators a plethora of related results , applicable in specialised situations , see e.g.  @xcite for a discussion . however , the lack of a result like theorem  [ thm : sfuc ] was a bottleneck for further progress .",
    "estimates as in theorem  [ thm : sfuc ] have been developed and applied in a different area of mathematics , namely control theory for partial differential equations , starting with the seminal paper @xcite . in this context",
    "they are called _",
    "spectral inequalities_. in fact , our proof of theorem  [ thm : sfuc ] highlights how ideas from the theory of random schrdinger operators and control theory complement each other in an efficient way .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 measurable and bounded . denote by @xmath4 a cube in @xmath5 , by @xmath6 the union of @xmath7-balls centered at the points @xmath8 and contained in the corresponding unit cubes @xmath9 , and by @xmath10 one of the self - adjoint restrictions of the schrdinger operator @xmath11 to @xmath12 with either dirichlet , neumann , or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we formulate a scale - free quantitative unique continuation property for the operator @xmath10 .",

    "we can reformulate this statement as an uncertainty principle . for this purpose ,",
    "denote by @xmath27 the spectral projector of @xmath10 onto an interval @xmath28 and by @xmath29 the characteristic function of the set @xmath30 .    under the same assumptions as in the above theorem we have @xmath31}(h_l ) \\",

    "it depends on the radius @xmath7 in a polynomial way , and on @xmath35 and @xmath36 in an exponential way .",
    "note also that the constant is unaffected by a translation of a ball @xmath37 as long as it stays in the corresponding unit cube . for any @xmath38 ,",
    "the bound is uniform in the ensemble of potentials @xmath39 \\text { measurable } \\}$ ] .",
    "this is important , because we want to apply the theorem to random schrdinger operators .",
    "there the constant must not depend on the particular configuration of randomness .",
    "since the operator is lower bounded , we have @xmath40}(h_l ) = \\chi_{[- \\lvert v \\rvert_\\infty , e]}(h_l)$ ] .",

    "next we cite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.4 ) , where a quantitative dependence on the observability constant similar to theorem  [ thm : sfuc ] is obtained .",
    "it applies to approximate solutions of the stationary schrdinger equation .",
    "a common feature of theorems [ thm : bourgaink-13 ] and [ thm : sfuc ] is the appearance of the term @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively in the exponent .",

    "however , all these papers assumed unnatural regularity conditions , excluding the most basic and standard type of single site potential , where @xmath82 equals the characteristic function of a ball or a cube .",
    "this was not a coincidence but a consequence of the linearization method used in the proofs .",
    "our proof does not rely on linearization , but merely on monotonicity .",
    "while we have results for a broad class of random breather models , we restrict ourselves in this note for the purpose of clarity to the two mentioned cases , i.e.      in fact , since our proofs are based on the analysis of level sets of random potentials , they work also for other types of stochastic fields with non - linear , monotone randomness , not just for random breather potentials . specifically , the function @xmath84 merely needs to be polynomially increasing .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : sfuc ] relies on carleman estimates with and without boundary term , see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , on interpolation inequalities and an auxiliary cauchy problem in @xmath103 dimensions as discussed in @xcite , and finally on geometric covering arguments developed in the theory of random schrdinger operators , e.g.  @xcite .",

    "however , the strategy of @xcite is quite versatile and can be adapted to our setting .",

    "in particular , the derivatives of eigenvalues @xmath118 ( of finite box restrictions on @xmath119 w.r.t .  each @xmath120",
