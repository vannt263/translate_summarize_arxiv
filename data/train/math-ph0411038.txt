    "the dipolar sle maps describe curves starting at a point @xmath21 on the boundary and ending on the boundary at a random point on the interval between the two fixed points that does not contain @xmath2 .",
    "the crucial point is that for a simply connected domain , the group of conformal automorphisms fixing two boundary points is a one parameter lie group isomorphic to the additive group of real numbers .",
    "hence , there is a canonical definition of a brownian motion between @xmath6 and @xmath5 starting at @xmath2 , at least when the corresponding boundary interval is a simple curve .",

    "the trace is space filling .",
    "however , in contrast to the chordal sle case , for dipolar sles , the hull does not fill the entire domain even for @xmath42",
    ".    it will be convenient to consider the map which maps the tip of the sle trace back to its starting point .",
    "thus we translate @xmath16 and let @xmath43 so that @xmath44 .",
    "the dipolar stochastic equation is simply : @xmath45 the maps @xmath46 are such that , for @xmath47 , @xmath48 is distributed as @xmath49 .",
    "eq.([sdipol ] ) may be integrated in the simple deterministic case with @xmath50 constant .",
    "then @xmath51 for @xmath35 .",
    "the trace @xmath52 is determined by @xmath53 , so that it starts on the real axis at @xmath54 and stops when it touches the upper boundary of the strip at the point @xmath55 . as expected , all points at the left of the trace are mapped to the fixed point at @xmath56 by @xmath46 as @xmath57 , while those on the right of the curve are mapped into the other fixed point @xmath58 .",
    "let us return to the case when @xmath50 is a brownian motion .",
    "a simple probabilistic argument , explained in @xcite , shows that the probabilities for the trace to touch the upper boundary in finite time vanishes .",
    "so , the trace only touches this boundary at infinite time .",
    "this amounts to stop the process when the trace hits the upper boundary , a criterion which is invariant under time reparametrizations of the evolution . since locally",
    "the dipolar sle trace looks the same as the chordal or radial sle traces @xcite , this leads to the following picture . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the hull coincides with the trace .",
    "the latter does not touch the lower boundary , ie .",

    "this section is a recreative interlude in which we explain why ( conditional ) correlation functions of models of statistical mechanics are martingales for appropriate stochastic processes . as a very general statement",
    "this remark may look tautological but it is nevertheless quite instructive .",

    "@xmath70 is the trivial partition with @xmath62 as its single piece .",
    "we assume these partitions to be finer as @xmath15 increases , which means that for any @xmath47 and any element @xmath67 of the partition at time @xmath15 there exist elements of @xmath71 which form a partition of @xmath67 .",
    "an example of such partitions in case of spin statistical models consists in specifying the values of local spin variables at an increasing number of lattice points .",
    "block spin clustering used in renormalization group is another way to produce such partitions .",
    "a sle inspired example consists in specifying the shapes and the positions of interfaces of increasing lengths .",
    "we define the restricted partition function @xmath72 by @xmath73 since restricting the summation to a subset amounts to impose some condition on the statistical configurations , @xmath72 is the partition function conditioned by the knowledge specified by @xmath67 .    to define a stochastic process we have to specify the probability space and a filtration on it .",

    "the remarkable observation made by o. schramm is that conformal invariance implies that the filtration associated to the partial knowledge of the interface is that of a continuous martingale , i.e. that of a brownian motion if time is chosen cleverly .",
    "the only parameter is @xmath1 .",
    "the physical parameters of the cft , for instance the central charge , can be retrieved by imposing that the correlation functions @xmath88 conditioned by the knowledge of @xmath89 be martingales .",

    "although this construction can be seen merely as a trick to construct martingales , the previous section explains why the martingale property is what ensures that the cft identified in this way is precisely the critical continuum limit of the statistical mechanics model that produces the interface described by sle .",

    "as illustrated in previous sections , they provide a generalization of chordal sles with more structures since the hulls do not totally fill the domain for @xmath7 . the fact that the bulk visiting probabilities we computed are harmonic functions is clearly related to the discrete harmonic explorer .",
