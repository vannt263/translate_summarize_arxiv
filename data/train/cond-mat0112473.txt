    "as a remarkable example of strongly correlated electron systems , the fractional quantum hall effect has been studied extensively.@xcite in the fractional quantum hall systems , the coulomb interaction plays a dominant role . due to the presence of the strong magnetic field , the coulomb interaction gives rise to a two - body correlation of non - zero relative angular momentum . the laughlin wave function,@xcite which captures the essential properties of the system , consists of this two - body correlation only .",
    "the role of the coulomb interaction to generate the two - body correlation becomes clear when it is described in terms of haldane s pseudopotential.@xcite from the analysis of the pseudopotentials , one can see that the most fundamental contribution comes from the short - range coulomb interaction .    in the single - layer quantum hall systems",

    "in this section , we discuss the bilayer quantum hall systems in the absence of the inter - layer tunneling in order to find the appropriate choice of the number of attached fluxes for composite fermions . for the determination of those numbers , the effect of inter - layer tunneling may be negligible because they are associated with the two - body correlation due to the short - range coulomb interaction as discussed in introduction .    since the two - body correlations , which is connected with the numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the @xmath4 wave function ( [ mmn_wf ] ) , is associated with the short - range coulomb interaction , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are determined by `` high - enrgy '' physics .",
