    "over the last five years , the issue of whether or not there is a nonzero value for the vacuum energy density , or cosmological constant , has been raised quite often .",
    "indeed , the possibility of a nonzero cosmological constant @xmath9 has been entertained several times in the past for theoretical and observational reasons ( the early history of @xmath9 as a parameter in general relativity has been reviewed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "recent supernovae results @xcite , @xcite strongly support a positive and possibly quite large cosmological constant . even taking the hubble constant to be in the range 60 - 75 km / s / mpc it is possible to show @xcite that the standard model of flat space with vanishing cosmological constant is ruled out . in a very nice review @xcite it is argued that postulating an @xmath10-dominated model seems to solve a lot of problems at once . and",
    "again , in a quite recent review on the physics and cosmology of the cosmological constant , it is added that ",
    "recent years have provided the best evidence yet that this elusive quantity does play an important dynamical role in the universe \" @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the classical tests of cosmology are applied to a simple kantowski - sachs metric and the results compared with those obtained for the standard model , the observations will not be able to distinguish between these models if the hubble parameters along the orthogonal directions are assumed to be approximately equal @xcite .",
    "indeed , as @xcite points out , the number of cosmological solutions which demonstrate exact isotropy well after the big bang origin of the universe is a small fraction of the set of allowable solutions of the cosmological equations .",
    "it is therefore prudent to take seriously the possibility that the universe is expanding anisotropically .",
    "note also that some shear free anisotropic models display a flrw - like behavior , as it is shown in @xcite .",
    "taking all this into consideration , we discuss the behavior of some homogeneous but anisotropic models with axial symmetry , filled with a pressureless perfect fluid ( dust ) and a non vanishing cosmological constant . for this",
    ", we will restrict our study to the the metric forms @xmath12 with the two scale factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the curvature index of the 2-dimensional surface @xmath16 and can take the values @xmath17 implying @xmath18 equal @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , respectively , giving the following three different metrics : kantowski - sachs , bianchi type - i , and bianchi type - iii @xcite , @xcite .",
    "einstein equations for the metric ( [ metric ] ) , for which the matter content is in the form of a perfect fluid and a cosmological term , @xmath9 , are then as follows @xcite , @xcite : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the matter density and @xmath26 is the ( isotropic ) pressure of the fluid . here",
    "@xmath27 is the newton s gravitational constant and @xmath28 is the speed of light .",
    "if we consider a vanishing pressure @xmath29 , which is compatible with the present conditions for the universe , the last two equations take the form @xmath30 @xmath31 and equation ( [ ee2b ] ) can easily be integrated to give @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant of integration .",
    "the hubble parameters corresponding to the scale factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined by    @xmath34    using them to introduce the following dimensionless parameters , in analogy with which it is usually done in the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universes , let us define @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 the conservation equation ( [ eqc1 ] ) can now be rewritten as @xmath38    now defining the dimensionless variable @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the angular scale factor for the present age of the universe , and using equation ( [ eqfg2 ] ) ( taken for @xmath41 ) , one may rewrite equation ( [ eqc1 ] ) as @xmath42 where the density parameters defined previously and @xmath43 with the zero subscript , denote as before these quantities at the present time @xmath44 . in this way , the number of independent parameters have been reduced . substituting equation ( [ eqc1 ] ) into equation ( [ ee1a ] ) gives @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant proportional to the matter in the universe , @xmath47 using the procedure above , equation ( [ dota ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 from equation ( [ ee1a ] ) one may define a matter density parameter . for this , we introduce the notion of mean hubble factor @xmath50 such that @xmath51 . also , for these models , the shear scalar @xmath52 @xcite is given by @xmath53 thus , equation ( [ ee1a ] ) may be rewritten @xcite as @xmath54 as in flrw we call critical matter density @xmath55 when @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath58 the matter density is generally defined as @xmath59 , then @xmath60 just like in flrw models , and such that @xmath61 when @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and which is related to @xmath62 by @xmath63 although @xmath64 is not the matter density parameter , it performs the same important role .",
    "we emphasize the fact that if for one particular time @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then , by equations ( [ eqfg2 ] ) , ( [ eqc3 ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) , @xmath67 ; and if @xmath68 and @xmath69 , then , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    introducing another dimensionless variable @xmath72 , equation ( [ dota ] ) takes the form @xmath73 and its number of independent parameters was also reduced , now at the expense of equation ( [ eqc3 ] ) taken for the present time @xmath41 .    now",
    ", we want to find the time dependence of @xmath14 in a qualitative way , starting from equation ( [ eqy ] ) .",
    "since the model universe will be defined only where @xmath74 , as was previously done by @xcite for flrw models , the problem is reduced to find out the zeros of @xmath75 , with @xmath76 .",
    "there are two @xmath77 values which characterize two zones of distinct behavior for the scale factor @xmath78 . starting with condition @xmath79",
    "one may obtain @xmath80 if we consider @xmath81 , as a function of @xmath82 , then this function presents a relative minimum and a maximum , that we will denote by @xmath83 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the relative minimum depends on @xmath84 in the following way @xcite : for @xmath85 we have @xmath86^{1/3}+ \\right . \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left . \\frac{1}{\\left [ \\sqrt{(\\omega_{m_{0}}-1)^2/\\omega_{m_{0}}^2 - 1 } + ( 1-\\omega_{m_{0}})/\\omega_{m_{0 } } \\right]^{1/3 } } \\right\\}- ( \\omega_{m_{0}}-1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath87 the expression is @xmath88 the relative maximum is done by @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "these expressions are limiting zones of the ( @xmath91 ) plane , where @xmath79 has three or one solutions ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath3 expression is also defined for @xmath92 , but it has the meaning of a maximum only for @xmath93 . the @xmath2 less or equal to @xmath3 imposes the recollapse of scale factor @xmath78 , while greater values produces inflexional behaviors for @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath2 values greater or equal to @xmath83 are physically  forbidden \" because they do nt reproduce the present universe ( see @xcite ) . obviously , @xmath94 always .",
    "although we are considering anisotropic models , the equation ( [ eqy ] ) for @xmath75 as a function of @xmath84 is mathematically the same as equation ( 2 ) obtained by @xcite for the homogeneous and isotropic flrw models . from equations ( [ eqy ] ) and ( [ eqx ] )",
    "one obtains the differential equation @xmath95    this equation automatically complies with the two conservation equations ( [ eqfg2 ] ) and ( [ eqc3 ] ) evaluated at @xmath44 .",
    "there are some particular values of the parameters ( @xmath96 ) for which this equation has exact solutions .",
    "however , for the majority of the values of the parameters , the solution has only been obtained by numerical integration .",
    "we may admit that at a certain moment of time , which we can take as the present time @xmath44 , the hubble parameters along the orthogonal directions may be assumed to be approximately equal , @xmath97 , even though we started with an anisotropic geometry .",
    "this hypothesis has been considered in @xcite for the case of a kantowski - sachs ( ks ) model . from this study",
    "was derived the conclusion that the classical tests of cosmology are not at present sufficiently accurate to distinguish between a flrw model and the ks defined in that paper , with @xmath98 , except for small values of @xmath99 .",
    "taking @xmath100 for simplicity , one can then integrate equation ( [ dif ] ) and find three different solutions , one for each @xmath15 value .",
    "figure 1 and figure 2 shows the three kinds of behaviors as a result of integration .",
    "the behavior for the kantowski - sachs and bianchi type - iii cases depends on the @xmath2 value .",
    "if @xmath101 , there will be a maximum value for @xmath102 and since then @xmath103 , the slope of the curve @xmath104 will be infinite at that point .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath105 for kantowski - sachs , and @xmath106 for bianchi type - iii , even though @xmath107 is finite .",
    "when @xmath108 , after @xmath109 is reached we find an almost linear relation between the two scale factors @xmath110 and @xmath82 for the two models .",
    "while for bianchi type - i model we have @xmath111 for the present restrictions .",
    "so , we see that for the ks model , the scale factor @xmath13 starts from infinity if @xmath14 starts from zero . for the bianchi type - i model ,",
    "the scale factors are always proportional or even equal .",
    "in this situation we do nt have an anisotropic model ; in fact , we can easily prove that this model is isotropic by a properly reparametrization of the coordinates .",
    "for the bianchi type - iii model , the scale factor @xmath14 never starts from zero , but has an initial value different from zero when @xmath112 is null .",
    "the following plot shows the zones in the 2-dimensional parameter space ( @xmath113 ) where each model is allowed ( figure 3 ) .",
    "taking into account the analysis given in @xcite , we may easily derive the qualitative behavior of @xmath114 , since our equation ( [ eqy ] ) is mathematically equivalent to his equation ( 3 ) .",
    "now , going back to figure 1 and figure 2 , one can then determine the @xmath115 .",
    "the plotting below summarizes the several possibilities for the three models : kantowski - sachs , bianchi type - i and bianchi type - iii models , respectively .",
    "the present technology allows us to  see \" the epoch of last scattering of radiation at a redshift of about @xmath116 , i.e. , we can actually observe the most distant information that the universe provides .",
    "the high level of isotropy observed from the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite from this epoch to our days imposes that the two hubble factors @xmath117 and @xmath43 must remain approximately equal from this epoch to the present . in other words , we must impose a high isotropy level from the last scattering onwards , in our expressions , i.e. , @xmath118 such that @xmath119 . from cobe",
    "4-year data @xcite , @xcite , we have @xmath120 and for last scattering epoch @xmath121 . at the last scattering we may still consider @xmath122 ( @xmath50 defined above ) .",
    "we computed several numerical integrations , with equation ( [ dif ] ) , by the following way : we gave values to @xmath123 and @xmath124 and integrated back in time , from now to the last scattering epoch .",
    "these @xmath123 and @xmath124 values were chosen such that , at last scattering epoch we had @xmath125 or @xmath126 . to make this we implemented a 8 order runge - kutta method @xcite .",
    "we concluded that the sum @xmath127 must be close to the unity from above for kantowski - sachs and from below for bianchi type - iii models ) , with our restrictions , we have always @xmath128 . ] .",
    "we summarized in the table below the result of imposing @xmath129 for kantowski - sachs and bianchi type - iii models , supposing @xmath100 ( because @xmath130 ) .",
    ".density parameters and relative difference between @xmath117 and @xmath43 for kantowsky - sachs and bianchi type - iii models .",
    "[ tbl ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the table above we concluded that all combinations of @xmath131 near the unity are equally acceptable for reproducing a small anisotropy ( @xmath132 ) at the last scattering .",
    "nevertheless we paid special attention to the values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , since they reproduce the better fit to recent observations @xcite .",
    "we have in this scenario @xmath135 for kantowski - sachs and bianchi type - iii universes .",
    "all these models approach locally an exponential expanding state @xcite provided the cosmological constant if we consider @xmath8 .",
    "for the kantowski - sachs model ( @xmath136 ) ( see figures 4 and 5 ) , we conclude that if the scale factor @xmath14 starts from zero , then the scale factor @xmath13 will start from infinity and decreases afterwards . when @xmath137 , @xmath14 reaches the maximum value recollapsing after that .",
    "so , @xmath13 will reach a relative maximum , when @xmath14 is maximum , ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "after that , when @xmath138 , @xmath13 goes to infinity again .",
    "when @xmath108 , the scale factor @xmath14 grows indefinitely , giving place to an inflationary scenario .",
    "then , @xmath13 decreases reaching a minimum value , and growing after that indefinitely , and becoming proportional to @xmath14 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the initial singularity is of a  cigar \" type .    for the bianchi type - i model ( @xmath139 ) ( see figures 6 and 7 ) , the scale factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 are proportional or even equal .",
    "thus , this model turns out to be an isotropic one ( owing to our restrictions ) and @xmath7 . however , when @xmath140 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 reach the maximum and recollapse after that . and",
    "when @xmath108 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 grow indefinitely after an inflection .    for the bianchi type - iii model ( @xmath141 ) ( see figures 8 and 9 ) , when @xmath137 , @xmath14 starts from an initial non vanishing value @xmath142 , reaching a maximum and recollapsing after that until reaches the same value for @xmath143 .",
    "also , @xmath13 has a similar behavior , but starts from zero and recollapses to zero , nevertheless , @xmath13 exhibits a relative minimum when @xmath14 is maximum . when @xmath144 , @xmath14 starts again from a non vanishing value @xmath145 , growing indefinitely with an inflection . in this case",
    ", @xmath13 starts from zero and grows indefinitely becoming approximately proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "so , the initial singularity is of a  pancake \" type .    in conclusion",
    ", these models undergo isotropization becoming an asymptotically flrw , except for the kantowski - sachs model @xmath0 with @xmath146 and for the bianchi type - iii @xmath147 with @xmath148 . taking into account the accuracy of the measurements of anisotropy on one hand and the fact that we can always adjust the density parameters such that @xmath149 , with @xmath150 on the other , we conclude that these models can still stand as good candidates to describe the observed universe .",
