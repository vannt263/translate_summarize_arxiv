    "several recent observations of h@xmath0  in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) indicate an average cosmic - ray ionization rate of molecular hydrogen of about @xmath3  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this value is about 1 order of magnitude larger than was previously inferred using other molecular tracers such as hd and oh @xcite . however , several models have also required ionization rates on the order of @xmath5 s@xmath4 @xcite in order to reproduce the observed abundances of various atomic and molecular species .",
    "this agreement , coupled with the simplicity behind the chemistry of h@xmath0 , leads us to conclude that the newer measurements are most likely correct . in this paper",
    ", we explore the implications that a high ionization rate has for cosmic rays and related observables .    aside from observational inferences , the cosmic - ray ionization rate can also be calculated theoretically using an ionization cross section and cosmic - ray energy spectrum .",
    "while the ionization cross section for hydrogen is well determined @xcite , the cosmic - ray spectrum below about 1  gev is unknown .",
    "this is because low energy cosmic rays are deflected from the inner solar system by the magnetic field coupled to the solar wind ( an effect called modulation ) and so the flux at these energies can not be directly observed .",
    "this theoretical calculation of the ionization rate has been performed several times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with each study choosing a different low energy cosmic - ray spectrum for various reasons .",
    "most recently , @xcite predicted an ionization rate of @xmath6  s@xmath4 using interstellar proton , heavy nuclei , and electron cosmic - ray spectra .",
    "the proton and heavy nuclei spectra were found by attempting to remove the effects of solar modulation from _ pioneer _ and _ voyager _ observations , while the electron spectrum was derived from radio and low - energy gamma - ray measurements .",
    "even having accounted for all of these components , this result falls about 1 order of magnitude short of the inference based on h@xmath0 , suggesting that the de - modulated solar system spectrum may not be the same as the interstellar spectrum in diffuse clouds , and/or that the @xcite extrapolation to low energies underestimates the true interstellar value .",
    "together , all of the above studies have shown that the ionization of interstellar hydrogen is a powerful observable for probing cosmic - ray interactions with the environments through which they propagate . beyond ionization",
    "though , cosmic rays will interact with the ism in other ways which lead to additional and complementary observables .",
    "namely , inelastic collisions between cosmic - rays and interstellar nuclei inevitably : ( i ) create light element isotopes @xmath7li , @xmath8li , @xmath9be , @xmath10b , and @xmath11b when cosmic rays spall c , n , and o nuclei @xcite , and ( ii ) excite nuclear states such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the decay of which produce gamma - ray lines , most prominently at 4.44  mev and 6.13  mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "similar to the theoretical calculation of the ionization rate , a cosmic - ray spectrum and relevant cross sections can be used to determine the production rates of light elements and gamma - ray lines .",
    "both the light element ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) calculations have been performed multiple times , again with each study choosing a different low energy cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "some of the spectra that have been used for these calculations are shown in figure [ fig1 ] . while several more cosmic - ray spectra have been used , many share functional forms with those plotted and",
    "so have been omitted for the sake of clarity .",
    "note that all of the spectra agree with demodulated data ( shaded region ) above a few hundred mev and raw data ( crosses ) above a few gev , but that they can differ by about 4 orders of magnitude at 1 mev .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] is shown primarily to illustrate our poor understanding of the low - energy portion of the cosmic - ray spectrum .    in this study",
    ", we calculate the cosmic - ray ionization rate using several low energy cosmic - ray spectra in an attempt to reproduce the value inferred from h@xmath0  observations . for the spectra that successfully predict ionization rates close to the inferred value of @xmath14 s@xmath4",
    ", we further investigate the implications that they have on dense cloud ionization rates , light element abundances , gamma - ray fluxes , and energetics arguments .",
    "the chemistry behind h@xmath0  in the diffuse ism is rather simple .",
    "its formation and destruction are given by the reactions : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 h@xmath1 is first ionized , after which the h@xmath18 ion quickly reacts with another h@xmath1 molecule to form h@xmath0 . in diffuse ( and dense ) clouds it is assumed that this ionization is due almost entirely to cosmic rays , as the flux of photons with @xmath19  ev will be quickly attenuated by atomic hydrogen in the outer regions of the cloud .",
    "the first step is many orders of magnitude slower , so it acts as the overall rate limiting step .",
    "the primary channel for destroying h@xmath0  in diffuse clouds is recombination with an electron .",
    "h@xmath0  is destroyed by reaction ( [ eqh3 + 3 ] ) on a time scale of about 100 years , much shorter than the @xmath20  yr lifetime of diffuse clouds @xcite , so the steady - state approximation is valid and the formation and destruction rates can be equated .",
    "this assumption yields @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ionization rate of h@xmath1 , @xmath23 is the h@xmath0-electron recombination rate constant , and @xmath24 s are number densities .",
    "spectroscopic observations of transitions from the two lowest rotational levels of h@xmath0 , the only levels populated at the low temperatures of diffuse interstellar clouds , provide the h@xmath0  column density .",
    "the cloud path length is then found using the observed hydrogen column density and inferred hydrogen number density .",
    "dividing the h@xmath0  column by the path length gives @xmath25 , and leaves three variables in the steady state equation : @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath26 .",
    "however , previous work has shown that the h@xmath0-electron recombination rate @xcite and the electron - to - hydrogen ratio @xcite are relatively well constrained , leaving @xmath22 as the only free parameter .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ eqh3+ss ] ) and using various other relationships and assumptions , @xcite derived an equation for the cosmic - ray ionization rate that depends on observables . this equation was then used to infer the ionization rate toward several diffuse cloud sight lines . from all of the sight lines with",
    "detections , the average cosmic - ray ionization rate of molecular hydrogen was found to be about @xmath3  s@xmath4 with a maximum uncertainty of about a factor of three either way ( see  4.2 of @xcite for a discussion of the calculations and uncertainties ) .",
    "assuming that the ionization rate above is uniform throughout the diffuse galactic ism , it is relatively simple to estimate the total , galaxy - wide amount of power necessary to produce such a high value . while this assumption of uniformity is not strictly valid ( there are diffuse clouds with @xmath27  s@xmath4 and clouds in the galactic center with @xmath28  s@xmath4 @xcite ) , the small sample size of sight lines does not allow for the determination of a meaningful relationship between position and ionization rate . despite these fluctuations , if all atomic hydrogen experiences the same ionization rate _ on average _ , then the galactic luminosity in ionizing cosmic rays , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average energy lost by cosmic rays per ionization event .",
    "the number of hydrogen atoms in diffuse clouds is the ratio of the mass of all atomic hydrogen in diffuse clouds in the galaxy , @xmath32 , to the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath33 .",
    "the ionization rate of _ atomic _ hydrogen , @xmath34 , is related to the ionization rate of _ molecular _ hydrogen ( the observable probed by h@xmath0 ) by @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the coefficients here are further explained in  5 .",
    "given the ionization rates from the previous section , we may place a _ model - independent lower limit _ on the ionizing cosmic - ray luminosity as follows .",
    "each ionization event requires a cosmic - ray energy input @xmath36 ev , the ionization potential of atomic hydrogen . on average cosmic rays",
    "will lose more than 13.6 ev in the ionization process though , so by setting @xmath37 ev in eq .",
    "( [ eqcrlum ] ) we calculate a hard lower limit on the power requirement . the gas mass relevant to eq .",
    "( [ eqcrlum ] ) is that of all neutral hydrogen in galactic diffuse clouds , which we take to be @xmath38 ( the average of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "this value results in a lower limit to the cosmic - ray luminosity of [ eq : eion ] l_cr , ionize > 0.1110 ^ 51  erg  ( 100  yr)^-1 .",
    "note that this cosmic - ray `` energy demand '' is in addition to the requirements found based on cosmic - ray energy lost as the particles escape the galaxy .",
    "@xcite estimated the sum of both contributions , and found @xmath39 which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : eion ] ) but also implies that ionization represents a significant part of the cosmic - ray energy budget .    however , eq .  ( [ eq : eion ] ) is only the lower limit to the amount of cosmic - ray energy that goes into ionization .",
    "we can get an actual estimate on the luminosity of ionizing cosmic rays by accounting for molecular hydrogen and by using a more precise value of @xmath31 . according to @xcite",
    "the average energy lost during an ionization event is about 30 ev , which by itself increases @xmath29 to @xmath40  erg  ( 100  yr)@xmath4 .",
    "the inclusion of h@xmath1 is more complicated .",
    "the mass of h@xmath1 is about the same as that of h in the galaxy , but most h@xmath1 resides in dense molecular clouds @xcite which do not experience the same cosmic - ray ionization rate as the diffuse ism @xcite . assuming half of all galactic h@xmath1 experiences the ionization rate used above , @xmath41 , a large fraction of the result found by @xcite .    as it is currently believed that galactic cosmic rays are accelerated in supernova remnants ( snr ) , these results have implications for the efficiency with which supernova mechanical energy is transferred to particle acceleration .",
    "if a typical supernova releases @xmath42  erg of mechanical energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath43 supernovae ( sne ) occur each century in the galaxy @xcite , then at least 4% of the energy released in sne must accelerate the cosmic rays which ionize hydrogen in the ism .",
    "this efficiency climbs to 12% if we take the more realistic estimate instead of the lower limit .",
    "however , uncertainties in the supernova rate , supernova energy , and mass of hydrogen in the galaxy lead to a total uncertainty of about a factor of 5 either way for this value .",
    "it is important to note though that this calculation depends only on the cosmic - ray ionization rate , and not on an adopted form of the cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "in contrast , calculating the ionization rate is highly dependent on the cosmic - ray spectrum , to which we now turn .",
    "given the well - understood physics of the passage of energetic particles through matter , the ionization rate completely reflects the spectrum of cosmic rays . in particular , the ionization cross section ( below , eq .  [ eqhxsec ] ) grows towards low energies as @xmath44 which means that the lowest - energy particles have the strongest effect on ionization .",
    "given our lack of direct observational constraints on cosmic rays at low energies , we will examine the ionization arising from various possible low - energy behaviors which are physically motivated and/or have been suggested in the literature .",
    "here we summarize in a somewhat pedagogical way some of the main features of the current understanding of cosmic - ray acceleration and propagation .",
    "the cosmic - ray spectrum with the strongest physical motivation ( in our view ) takes supernova explosions to be the engines of galactic cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "that is , supernovae remnants provide the sites for diffusive shock acceleration and thus act as cosmic - ray sources . at these sources , diffusive shock acceleration creates particles with spectra which are close to simple power - laws in ( relativistic ) momentum @xmath45 .",
    "specifically , consider the `` test - particle '' limit when particle acceleration has a negligible effect on the shock energy and structure . in this limit , the cosmic - ray production rate , @xmath46",
    ", per unit volume and time and per unit interval in relativistic momentum has famously been analytically shown to be ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) [ eq : shockaccel ] q_shock accel =  p^- , i.e. , a power - law in momentum . here",
    "the momentum index in the case of strong shocks is @xmath47 , where the shock mach number is @xmath48 .",
    "the upshot is that for strong shocks ( large @xmath49 ) as one would find in supernova remnants , the acceleration power law is just slightly steeper than the flattest ( i.e. , largest at high - energy ) limiting power - law spectrum allowed by energy conservation : @xmath50 .",
    "going beyond the test - particle limit requires nonlinear treatment of the feedback of cosmic ray energy and pressure on the shock structure and evolution ; the study of this nonlinear shock acceleration remains a vital field , but several groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find that the accelerated particles have a spectrum which is roughly similar to the test - particle result , but which shows some concavity in momentum space , i.e. , the effective spectral index @xmath51 does show a modulation around the constant test - particle value .",
    "intriguingly , there seems to be agreement on the qualitative result that the low - energy flux will be higher than for the test - particle predictions .",
    "unfortunately , the quantitative results remain at present rather model - dependent . for the purposes of our analysis",
    ", we will simply adopt test - particle power - law acceleration spectra as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shockaccel ] ) .",
    "our results can then be viewed as testing the validity of the test - particle approximation at low energies .    once produced at acceleration sites , cosmic rays",
    "propagate away , and eventually are removed either by escape from the galaxy or by stopping in the ism due to energy losses ( predominantly by energy transfer to the ism , either ionization or excitation of atoms or molecules ) .",
    "propagation alters the spectra of cosmic rays from those at the sources .",
    "theoretical treatments of these effects typically make the simplifying assumption of a steady state balance between production and losses .",
    "the resulting `` propagated '' spectrum should represent the flux as seen by an average region of the interstellar medium , far from cosmic - ray sources ( elegantly reviewed in * ? ? ?",
    "a full calculation of cosmic - ray propagation at minimum involves the particle `` flows '' in energy space ; the simplest such treatment is the classic `` leaky - box '' model which treats the galaxy as a medium with sources distributed homogeneously .",
    "more sophisticated models account for the inhomogeneous galaxy and effects such as diffusion and re - acceleration . in general , when models include the low - energy regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they find that when initially accelerated or `` injected '' spectra are power - laws in momentum , the resulting propagated spectra are very nearly also power laws , with fairly abrupt changes of spectral indices at characteristic energy scales ( `` breaks '' ) at which one loss mechanism comes to dominate over another . to fix notation , for our purposes cosmic rays are most usefully characterized by the propagated cosmic - ray flux ( strictly speaking , specific intensity ) @xmath52 per unit energy interval . for all but the most ultra - high energies , cosmic rays",
    "are observed to be isotropic , in which case the flux is related to the cosmic - ray number density @xmath53 via @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 is the cosmic - ray kinetic energy ; the total relativistic energy is thus @xmath56 .",
    "relativistic energy and momentum are related by @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . using these",
    ", it follows that the flux per unit energy is equal to the particle number density per unit momentum : @xmath59 .",
    "hence , a number spectrum @xmath60 that is a power law in @xmath45 gives a flux with the same power - law of @xmath61 .    as a result , we characterize possible propagated proton spectra with a piecewise power law in relativistic momentum @xmath61 : @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the arbitrary energy at which the flux is normalized to fit observations ; following @xcite we take @xmath64 @xmath65 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 gev@xmath4 . this and the observed ( high - energy ) spectral index @xmath66 fixes the high - energy region of the spectrum .",
    "the low - energy portion of the spectrum is crucial for this paper , and we take the high / low energy break to be @xmath67 , which is roughly where ionization losses begin to dominate diffusion and/or escape losses .",
    "the power law index for energies below @xmath68 is @xmath69 , and eq .",
    "( [ eqcrflux ] ) is arranged to guarantee that the flux is continuous across this break .",
    "finally , an effective low energy cutoff , @xmath70 , is chosen , below which the flux is zero .",
    "despite the fact that the flux will change as cosmic rays travel into a cloud , we assume a steady state such that the spectrum is the same everywhere .",
    "we also neglect the possible effects of self - confinement proposed by @xcite , in which magnetohydrodynamics can spatially confine cosmic rays to given regions due to changes in the ambient density .    in the case of the propagated spectrum , the momentum index @xmath71 , which corresponds to a source spectrum with @xmath72 and propagation dominated by energy losses ( the `` thick - target '' approximation ) .",
    "this spectrum is shown as the dotted curve in both figures [ fig1 ] & [ fig2 ] .",
    "the two vertical dashed lines in figure [ fig2 ] represent low energy cutoffs at 2  mev and 10  mev .",
    "these were chosen because cosmic rays with these energies have ranges roughly corresponding to the column densities of diffuse and dense clouds , respectively @xcite .",
    "following this reasoning , cosmic rays with @xmath73  mev should not penetrate diffuse clouds , and so will not contribute to the ionization rate there .",
    "likewise , cosmic rays with energies below 10 mev will not affect the ionization rate in dense clouds .",
    "another spectrum we consider is modeled after @xcite and @xcite who added a second sharply - peaked component  dubbed a `` carrot ''  to the propagated spectrum to give a high flux at energies of a few mev .",
    "the physical reasoning behind such a component is that in addition to the propagated spectrum , there is some local source of cosmic rays formed in weak shocks , represented by a steeper power law .",
    "this component is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 sets the flux of the carrot component to be some fraction of the propagated spectrum at @xmath68 , and the total cosmic - ray spectrum is taken to be the sum of the propagated and carrot components . to ensure that the carrot does not conflict with observations at high energies",
    ", @xmath75 should be relatively small ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 must be less than @xmath78 .",
    "in addition to the cosmic - ray spectra proposed above , we also consider several which have been used in the past for similar calculations ( see  1 and figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "determining the ionization rate produced by these spectra allowed us to check that our numerical integration code was working properly , and to see exactly what energy range of cosmic rays is responsible for the high ionization rate inferred from h@xmath0 .",
    "given a cosmic - ray spectrum and relevant ionization cross section , the cosmic - ray ionization rate is readily calculable .",
    "namely , the ionization rate of species x due to cosmic rays is given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the flux of cosmic - ray protons as a function of kinetic energy , @xmath81 is the ionization cross section of atomic hydrogen as a function of kinetic energy , @xmath82 is a coefficient accounting for ionization by heavier cosmic ray nuclei , and @xmath83 converts between the primary ionization rate of atomic hydrogen @xmath84 , computed by the integral , and the total ionization rate for a given species x. this conversion factor includes ionization due to secondary electrons produced in the initial event , and accounts for the difference in the ionization cross section between h and x ( @xmath85 ) .",

    "our estimate assumes that both the cosmic - ray spectrum and cno abundances have remained constant throughout the history of the galaxy . also , we assume that once created , the light element isotopes are not destroyed .",
    "as we know that light elements are destroyed ( `` astrated '' ) in stellar interiors , this assumption leads to further uncertainty in our model .",

    "first , most of the cross sections have low - energy thresholds in the tens of mev , meaning that the high flux in the few mev range has no effect on libeb production .",
    "second , the cross sections do not fall off steeply as energy increases , so the cosmic - ray flux in the hundreds of mev range ( where all three spectra are identical ) is important .",
    "this contrasts with the case of ionization where cosmic rays with the lowest energies above the cutoff dominate .",
    "however , much more significant than the absolute abundances are the _ ratios _ of these isotopes , which effectively remove the systematic uncertainties in the absolute abundances introduced by the simplicity of our model and directly reflect the shape of the cosmic - ray spectrum . while both of the low - energy - enhanced spectra underestimate the 10/9 ratio by about a factor of 1.5 , the carrot spectrum does a much better job of reproducing the 6/9 ratio",
    "; it overestimates the ratio by a factor of only @xmath123 compared to the broken power law s 2.4 .",
    "this success of the carrot spectrum is not surprising though , as we chose the input parameters to best reproduce the observed ionization rates and light element ratios .",
    "these `` optimal '' parameters were found by using various combinations of @xmath75 and @xmath77 to compute the ionization rate with a 2 and 10 mev cutoff , and the 6/9 and 10/9 ratios .",
    "figure [ figfalpha ] is a plot in @xmath124 space where the contours represent deviations of 10% and 25% from inferred values of @xmath22 in diffuse and dense clouds , and from measured meteoritic libeb ratios .",
    "it is clear from figure [ figfalpha ] that there is an overlapping region around @xmath125 and @xmath126 where @xmath22 for diffuse and dense clouds and 6/9 are all within 25% of observed values . in making the diffuse cloud ionization rate as close to @xmath14",
    "s@xmath4 as possible , we chose @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( indicated by the triangle in figure [ figfalpha ] ) as the parameters for the carrot spectrum .    while @xmath22 and 6/9 can be matched well , no combination of @xmath75 and @xmath77 is able to successfully reproduce the 10/9 ratio to within 25% simultaneously with any of the other observables .",
    "almost the entire range of figure [ figfalpha ] is within the 50% contour of 10/9 though , so our carrot spectrum is not completely out of the question .",
    "indeed , the carrot spectrum predicts almost the same 10/9 ratio as does the propagated spectrum , so the introduction of the carrot leaves the agreement with solar system data no worse than in the standard case .      in computing the production rates of gamma - rays , 6 total reactions were used .",
    "these include @xmath127+\\iso{c}{12 } \\rightarrow \\iso{c}{12}^ * \\rightarrow \\iso{c}{12}+\\gamma_{4.44}$ ] ; @xmath127+\\iso{o}{16 } \\rightarrow \\iso{o}{16}^ * \\rightarrow \\iso{o}{16}+\\gamma_{6.13}$ ] ; and @xmath127+\\iso{o}{16 } \\rightarrow \\iso{c}{12}^*+\\alpha \\rightarrow \\iso{c}{12}+\\alpha+\\gamma_{4.44}$ ] , where the de - excitations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 produce 4.44  mev and 6.13  mev gamma rays , respectively .",
    "cross sections for all of the above processes come from @xcite ( and references therein ) . along a line of sight with hydrogen column density @xmath128 , the gamma - ray line intensity is i_= n_h ( e ) _ ( e )  de , [ eq : gammaflux ] with units [ photons @xmath65 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 ] , and where for each line the product @xmath130 represents a sum over appropriately weighted projectiles and targets .",
    "if all diffuse clouds experience the same cosmic - ray flux and the column of such clouds through the galactic plane is about @xmath131  @xmath65 , our calculations predict that the galactic plane should have the diffuse @xmath132-ray fluxes shown in table [ tblgamma ] . assuming the intensity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaflux ] ) is uniform in the galactic plane , we integrated over the solid angle within @xmath133 , @xmath134 to find the total flux in the central radian of the galaxy ( a typical region over which diffuse @xmath132-ray fluxes are quoted , with units [ @xmath65 s@xmath4 rad@xmath4 ] ) . also shown in table [ tblgamma ] is the large - scale sensitivity of the _ integral _ spectrometer at @xmath135  mev @xcite .",
    "our predicted fluxes are below currently available detector limits of _",
    "integral_. thus the presence of low - energy cosmic - rays sufficient to give the ionization levels required by h@xmath0  does not violate gamma - ray constraints .",
    "l|c|ccc    4.44 mev & 10 & 3.0 & 8.3 & 0.9 + 6.13 mev & 10 & 2.4 & 5.9 & 0.4 +    indeed , the gamma - ray line predictions in table [ tblgamma ] lie tantalizingly close to present limits . while this does not provide a test of the predicted cosmic - ray spectra at present , it may be possible that _ integral _ itself , and certainly the next generation gamma - ray observatory , will have the ability to detect these lines . in any case , the results show that our proposed spectra are not inconsistent with observations .",
    "similar to the calculations in  3 , we can determine the energy budget for a given cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "unlike the previous calculation though , in this case the shape of the spectrum is important as we compute the energy loss rate of all of the cosmic rays in the spectrum .",
    "this is done via the usual bethe - bloch expression for energy loss @xmath136 per unit mass column @xmath137 : @xmath138 , \\label{eqeloss}\\ ] ] which is closely related to the ionization cross section above ( eq .",
    "[ eqhxsec ] ) .",
    "here we use @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141  ev ( see @xcite for a complete description of the variables involved ) .",
    "the rate of cosmic - ray energy loss per unit mass of neutral hydrogen is [ eq : dldm ] = 4(1+g_[eq : dldm ] ) _ e_low^e_high _ p(e )   de , where @xmath142 ( see the appendix ) . again using a galactic hydrogen mass of @xmath143 ,",
    "the carrot and broken power law spectra require energy inputs of @xmath144 erg ( 100  yr)@xmath4 and @xmath145 erg ( 100  yr)@xmath4 , respectively . these represent large fractions of the total mechanical energy released in sne .",
    "like in  3 , they are also consistent with the @xmath146 erg ( 100 yr)@xmath4 found by @xcite which accounted for both energy needed for ionization of the ism and escape from the galaxy .",
    "finally , we note that the large amounts of energy and high acceleration efficiencies required may help to resolve the superbubble `` energy crisis '' described by @xcite .",
    "beyond the total input energy requirement , each cosmic - ray spectrum will also have a particular energy density and pressure .",
    "energy density can be calculated from @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the velocity and @xmath149 ( see appendix ) , and pressure from @xmath150 where @xmath61 is again relativistic momentum , and @xmath151 .",
    "performing these calculations with @xmath96  mev results in energy densities of 0.77  ev  @xmath152 and 0.89  ev  @xmath152 , and pressures @xmath153 of 4300  k  @xmath152 and 5200  k  @xmath152 for the carrot and broken power law spectra , respectively .",
    "both pressures are in rough accord with the average thermal pressure in the diffuse ism of @xmath154  k  @xmath152 reported by @xcite .",
    "the energy densities in both spectra , however , are about one half of the value reported by @xcite .",
    "while this result may at first seem counterintuitive , it is best clarified graphically by figure [ figedense ] . here , it is shown that cosmic rays with energies between about 0.1  gev and 10 gev completely dominate in contributing to the energy density",
    "this was previously demonstrated by the analogous plot ( fig .",
    "7 ) in @xcite , from which the author concluded that low energy components , such as those proposed in this paper , would have little effect on the cosmic - ray energy density . as for why our spectra have lower energy densities ,",
    "this is almost entirely dependent on the flux normalization at higher energies . at about 1  gev the fluxes in our spectra are about one half that of the local interstellar spectrum used by @xcite , thus resulting in the corresponding factor of 2 difference in energy densities .",
    "one further effect that cosmic rays have is to heat the ism via energy lost during the ionization process . on average ,",
    "30 ev are lost by a cosmic ray during each ionization event @xcite . using @xmath155 s@xmath4 and the corresponding @xmath156 and assuming that the number density of atomic hydrogen is roughly equal to that of molecular hydrogen , and that all of the lost energy eventually goes into heating",
    ", we find a heating rate due to cosmic rays of @xmath157 erg s@xmath4 ( h atom)@xmath4 .",
    "this can be compared to the heating rate due to the photoelectric effect calculated by @xcite of @xmath158 erg s@xmath4 ( h atom)@xmath4 for the diffuse cloud sight line toward @xmath159 oph .",
    "the heating rate caused by cosmic - ray ionization is about 5 times smaller than the heating rate due to the photoelectric effect , demonstrating that even with such a high ionization rate , cosmic rays do not significantly alter the heating rate in diffuse clouds .",
    "this large difference in heating rates is further illustrated by figure 10 of @xcite .",
    "because the high flux of low energy cosmic rays we use will not dominate cloud heating , our spectra do not imply cloud temperatures that are inconsistent with observations .",
    "as described in  4 , the spectrum with seemingly the best physical motivation is one that arises from the propagation of particles accelerated by strong shocks in supernova remnants . this spectrum follows a @xmath160 relationship above a few hundred mev , matching observations , and a @xmath161 relationship below a few hundred mev in the ionization - dominated regime .",
    "a similar behavior is apparent in the spectra used by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , except they follow power laws closer to @xmath162 at low energies .",
    "even the more sophisticated models such as those considering re - acceleration @xcite or distributed cosmic - ray sources and a galactic wind @xcite follow these general power laws . because they decrease at low energy though , all of these spectra ( except @xcite which does not begin decreasing until @xmath163  mev ) are unable to provide enough flux at the energies where ionization is most efficient , and thus can not generate the high ionization rate inferred from h@xmath0 .",
    "it seems then that the propagation of cosmic rays accelerated by snr s ( with test - particle power - law spectra ) can not explain the high flux of low energy cosmic rays necessary in our spectra .",
    "however , plentiful evidence supports the idea that high - energy ( @xmath164 gev ) galactic cosmic rays _ do _ originate in supernovae : synchrotron emission in supernova remnants indicates electron acceleration and strongly suggests ion acceleration , and galaxy - wide cosmic - ray energetics are in line with supernova expectations and difficult to satisfy otherwise . for this reason we retained the propagated cosmic - ray spectrum to represent the supernova - accelerated galactic cosmic - ray component at high energies ( @xmath164 gev ) , but",
    "also considered _ additional _ cosmic - ray components which dominate at low energies where the ionization efficiency is high .",
    "while our carrot and broken power law spectra do not follow the conventional strong - shock thick - target @xmath165 relationship in the low - energy regime , recent studies are beginning to find possible sources for the proposed high flux of low energy cosmic rays .",
    "weak shocks will accelerate cosmic rays with preferentially steeper power laws ( see  4 ) , and may be ubiquitous in the ism , caused by star forming regions , ob associations , and even low mass stars like the sun .",
    "@xcite investigated the flux of termination shock protons at the heliosheath using the _ voyager _ spacecraft .",
    "their study showed that at low energies , @xmath166 , @xmath167 @xmath168 , and that from about 3.5 - 10 mev , this relationship steepened to @xmath169 @xmath170 .",
    "these so - called `` anomalous '' cosmic rays ( acrs ) clearly demonstrate that real sources exist in nature which can produce a high particle flux at low energies , though these measurements and the anomalous cosmic rays themselves are located in the heliosphere , not interstellar space .",
    "@xcite modeled the effects from the astropauses of all f , g , and k type stars in the galaxy to find a power of @xmath171 erg ( 100 yr)@xmath4 in acrs .",
    "this accounts for only about 10% of the power needed to produce the ionization rate inferred from h@xmath0 .",
    "however , their analysis did not include the effects of winds from the much more luminous o and b stars . to our knowledge ,",
    "no study has computed the interstellar cosmic - ray spectrum arising from the acrs of all stellar winds in the galaxy , but it may indeed be an important contribution to the flux of low energy cosmic rays .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that supernova shocks are considerably more efficient at low - energy particle acceleration than simple test - particle results would indicate . indeed ,",
    "theoretical non - linear shock acceleration calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do predict that low - energy particles have higher fluxes than in the test - particle limit .",
    "this result goes in the right direction qualitatively . however , published source spectra we are aware of do not appear steep enough at low energies  particularly after ionization losses are taken into account in propagation  to reproduce the observed ionization rate .",
    "it remains an interesting question whether more detailed nonlinear calculations , focussing on the low - energy regime , might provide a solution to the ionization problem ; in this case , ionization rates and gamma - ray lines would become new probes of feedback processes in supernova remnants .",
    "in addition to protons and heavy nuclei , it has been proposed that cosmic - ray electrons may make a significant contribution to the ionization rate .",
    "@xcite showed that the local interstellar spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons produces a primary ionization rate of @xmath172  s@xmath4 when considering energies above @xmath173 mev . while this is roughly equal to the ionization rate inferred for diffuse clouds at that time",
    ", electrons only account for about 10% of the primary ionization rate inferred from h@xmath0  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we have neglected the effect of cosmic - ray electrons in the present study .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that low - energy cosmic - ray electrons are probed by very low - frequency radio emission , and indeed cosmic - ray electron emission provides a major foreground for present and future facilities aimed at the measurement of cosmological 21-cm emission from high - redshift sources , including lofar @xcite and the square kilometer array @xcite .",
    "such observations should provide a detailed picture of low - energy cosmic - ray electrons , whose behavior can in turn be compared to the proton and nuclear components probed by the other observables considered in this paper .",
    "finally , we have found that the carrot spectrum produces 6/9 in good agreement with solar system data , and a 10/9 ratio which is almost identical to the standard propagated result but which is somewhat low with respect to the solar system value . to the extent that the isotope ratios are not in perfect agreement with solar system data , one possible explanation could be time variations of the cosmic - ray spectral shape over galactic history .",
    "if supernovae are the agents of cosmic - ray acceleration , then presumably strong shocks will always lead to high - energy source spectra with @xmath174 as we have today .",
    "however , the low - energy component responsible for the carrot derives from weaker shocks which in turn may reflect time - dependent properties of , e.g. , star - forming regions .",
    "moreover , cosmic - ray _ propagation _ is much more sensitive to the details of the interstellar environment , particularly the nature of galactic magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite suggested that such variations in the early galaxy might explain the b / be ratios in primitive ( population ii ) halo stars .",
    "similarly , if such variations were present in the later phases of galactic evolution ( e.g. , during major merger events ) then it is possible that the propagated cosmic - ray spectra could have differed substantially .",
    "the resulting libeb contributions could alter the ratios from the simple time - independent estimates we have made .",
    "another possible explanation to bring the theoretical libeb ratios into better agreement with observations would arise if the libeb isotopes suffer significantly different amounts of destruction ( astration ) in stellar interiors . because the binding energies are in the hierarchy @xmath175 , there should be a similar ranking of the fraction of the initial stellar abundance of these isotopes which survives to be re - ejected at a star s death .",
    "if the amount of 6 destroyed is greater than 9 , which is in turn greater than 10 , then the results from our carrot spectrum may be correct before accounting for astration .",
    "assuming this preferential destruction decreases our calculated 6/9 and increases 10/9 , moving both closer to the measured ratios .",
    "that said , conventional stellar models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and their implementation in galactic chemical evolution @xcite find different , but still small , survival fractions for all isotopes , @xmath176 for 10 .",
    "as a result , this scenario would seem to require large upward revisions to the survival of 9 and 10 in stars .",
    "gas phase chemistry in the ism is driven by ion - molecule reactions .",
    "photons with @xmath19  ev are severely attenuated in diffuse and dense clouds , meaning that cosmic rays are the primary ionization mechanism in such environments . as a result , the cosmic - ray ionization rate has a large effect on the chemical complexity of the cold neutral medium . in fact , it has a direct impact on the abundances of h@xmath0 , oh , hd , hco@xmath177 , and h@xmath178o@xmath177 , to name a few molecules .",
    "this makes the cosmic - ray ionization rate an important input parameter for astrochemical models which predict the abundances of various atomic and molecular species",
    ".    however , based on the current theoretical study it seems that instead of having a uniform galactic value , the cosmic - ray ionization rate should vary between sight lines . this has to do with the source behind cosmic - ray acceleration . while it has typically been assumed that low energy cosmic rays are accelerated in supernovae remnants , the spectra making this assumption were unable to reproduce the ionization rate inferred from h@xmath0 . instead",
    ", a low energy carrot was required , most likely produced by particles accelerated in weaker , more localized shocks .",
    "unlike the sne cosmic rays which are assumed to diffuse throughout the galaxy , cosmic rays accelerated in weak local shocks could lead to significant enhancements in the local ionization rate .",
    "observations of h@xmath0  have shown that the cosmic - ray ionization rate is in fact variable between different diffuse cloud sight lines .",
    "the h@xmath1 ionization rates toward @xmath159  per and x  per are about @xmath179  s@xmath4 @xcite , while @xmath180 upper limits toward @xmath159  oph and @xmath181  sco are as low as @xmath182  s@xmath4 and @xmath183  s@xmath4 , respectively . like the results of @xcite for dense clouds",
    ", this demonstrates that the cosmic - ray ionization rate can vary significantly between diffuse clouds as well .",
    "also , it suggests that instead of searching for or adopting a `` canonical '' ionization rate , sight lines must be evaluated on a case - by - case basis .    in order to test the theory that low energy cosmic rays are primarily accelerated by localized shocks , we propose two complementary observational surveys .",
    "first , the ionization rate should be inferred along several diffuse cloud sight lines which are surrounded by different environments .",
    "observations of h@xmath0  in sight lines near ob associations and sight lines near low mass stars should provide data in regions near and far from energetic sources .",
    "we expect the sight lines near more energetic regions to show higher ionization rates than those near less energetic regions .",
    "if observations confirm these predictions , then we will be able to more confidently conclude that most of the low energy ionizing cosmic rays are accelerated in localized shocks .",
    "the second set of observations we propose examines the ionization rate in regions of varying density . following the reasoning of  4 where we assume that the lower energy cosmic rays do not penetrate denser clouds ,",
    "the ionization rate should be inversely related to the cloud density .",
    "observing h@xmath0  in diffuse clouds , dense clouds , and in sight lines with intermediate densities should provide us with a range of ionization rates .",
    "we can then use the carrot spectrum with appropriate low energy cutoffs to reproduce the inferred ionization rates from each environment , thus constraining the slope of the carrot component .",
    "this slope will then allow us to roughly determine the strength ( or rather weakness ) of the shock necessary to produce such a steep power law , and thus infer the source of the shock .",
    "three theoretical low energy cosmic - ray spectra have been examined , all of which are consistent with direct cosmic - ray observations at high energies .",
    "we first adopted the standard @xmath184 source spectrum resulting from cosmic - ray acceleration by strong shocks in supernovae . the propagated version of this spectrum produced an ionization rate about 30 times smaller than that inferred from h@xmath0 , thus demanding that additional low - energy cosmic - rays be responsible for the observed ionization .",
    "we thus studied the effects of _ ad hoc _ but physically motivated low - energy cosmic - ray components .",
    "we found that the carrot and broken power law spectra could be fashioned so as to reproduce observed results for diffuse clouds .",
    "out of these two , the carrot spectrum did a much better job of matching the ionization rate in dense clouds . unlike the broken power law , the carrot spectrum was also capable of matching observed light element abundances to within a factor of 2 for the three isotopes produced solely by cosmic - ray spallation .",
    "these results are well within the expected uncertainties of libeb galactic chemical evolution .",
    "predictions for the gamma - ray line fluxes for both the carrot and broken power law were below the limits of current instruments , so these spectra are not inconsistent with data .",
    "indeed , our estimates are close to the detection limits of _ integral _ , and thus motivate a search for the 4.44 mev and 6.13 mev lines ( or limits to their intensity ) in the gamma - ray sky .",
    "finally , the energy necessary to accelerate all of the cosmic rays in these spectra is about @xmath185 erg ( 100 yr)@xmath4 .",
    "this is a substantial fraction of the mechanical energy released in supernovae explosions , although based on our results it may be necessary that much of this energy come from weak shocks in order to produce a high flux of low energy cosmic rays .",
    "together , all of these calculations demonstrate that the proposed carrot spectrum is consistent with astrochemical and astrophysical constraints . whether or not low - energy cosmic rays take precisely this spectral form , at the very least this example serves as a proof by construction that one can make cosmic - ray models which contain low - energy enhancements required by the high ionization rate inferred from h@xmath0 , while not grossly violating other observational constraints .",
    "this motivates future work which looks in more detail at the impact of low - energy cosmic rays .",

    "ni and bjm have been supported by nsf grant phy 05 - 55486 .",

    "this appendix discusses in more detail the calculations that went into determining the coefficients @xmath89 .",
    "we assume that all heavy cosmic - ray nuclei have the same spectral shape as protons , but that their fluxes are shifted down by their respective relative abundances to hydrogen ( e.g. @xmath186 ) . with this assumption",
    ", the contribution to the ionization rate due to heavy nuclei can be calculated from @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the charge which comes from eq .",

[ eq : dldm ] ) is controlled by the particle energy loss per unit mass column @xmath201 ( eq .  [ eqeloss ] ) .",
    "this changes the heavy nuclei coefficient to @xmath202 where the atomic mass , @xmath203 , is now included because of eq .",

    "this is because the abundances of most heavy nuclei are enhanced in gcrs when compared to solar . for the case of ionization ,",
    "@xmath82 becomes 1.4 , making heavy nuclei more important than protons .",
    "because the integral is multiplied by @xmath206 though , the overall difference in the ionization rate between using solar and gcr abundances is only a factor of 2.4/1.5=1.6 . using gcr abundances to calculate the energy loss rate changes @xmath207 by a negligible amount , from 0.1 to 0.11 .",
    "finally , gcr abundances only change @xmath208 and @xmath209 from 0.42 to 0.46 for the energy density and pressure calculations . despite the fact that heavy nuclei are measured to be more abundant in galactic cosmic rays than in the solar system , we have chosen to use solar abundances in our calculations .",
    "this is because the high energy cosmic rays observed are accelerated in metal - rich snrs , while the high flux of low energy cosmic rays is most likely due to weak shocks associated with low mass stars and the ism . due to this source difference",

    "<S> diffuse interstellar clouds show large abundances of h@xmath0  which can be maintained only by a high ionization rate of h@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> cosmic rays are the dominant ionization mechanism in this environment , so the large ionization rate implies a high cosmic - ray flux , and a large amount of energy residing in cosmic rays . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we find that the standard propagated cosmic - ray spectrum predicts an ionization rate much lower than that inferred from h@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> low - energy ( @xmath2 mev ) cosmic rays are the most efficient at ionizing hydrogen , but can not be directly detected ; consequently , an otherwise unobservable enhancement of the low - energy cosmic - ray flux offers a plausible explanation for the h@xmath0  results . beyond ionization </S>",
    "<S> , cosmic rays also interact with the interstellar medium by spalling atomic nuclei and exciting atomic nuclear states . </S>",
    "<S> these processes produce the light elements li , be , and b , as well as gamma - ray lines . to test the consequences of an enhanced low - energy cosmic - ray flux , we adopt two physically - motivated cosmic - ray spectra which by construction reproduce the ionization rate inferred in diffuse clouds , and investigate the implications of these spectra on dense cloud ionization rates , light element abundances , gamma - ray fluxes , and energetics . </S>",
    "<S> one spectrum proposed here provides an explanation for the high ionization rate seen in diffuse clouds while still appearing to be broadly consistent with other observables , but the shape of this spectrum suggests that supernovae remnants may not be the predominant accelerators of low - energy cosmic rays . </S>"
