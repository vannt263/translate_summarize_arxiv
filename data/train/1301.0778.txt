    "<S> we next proceed to the characterization of magnetic field detection using the protocol illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a . </S>",
    "<S> the output of the detector is the binary signal @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the noise in @xmath75 reflects the stochastic nature of quantum measurement ; in atomic magnetometry this noise is termed projection noise  @xcite . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we express the results of detection in terms of the magnetic flux @xmath25 applied to the qubit , as this facilitates the comparison with dc - squids . </S>",
    "<S> the noise in @xmath75 results in an equivalent noise in @xmath25 characterized by the spectral density @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath77 is the single - sided spectral density of the noise in the qubit readout and @xmath78 is the transfer function of the detector , with @xmath79 the average value of @xmath75 . </S>",

    "<S> the conversion factor @xmath83 is determined from the measurements shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b . </S>",
    "<S> in this way we determine the equivalent detector input noise fully from a set of measurable quantities , without any assumption on coupling of the field to the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> we use a spin - echo control sequence time @xmath84 chosen to correspond approximately to the optimal value for the measured qubit coherence time . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in this experiment sample coherence was affected by a two - level fluctuator , as shown by the structure of the spectroscopy peak and also by the fact that there are discrepancies between the observed spin - echo decay and the expected gaussian law  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use nevertheless the dependence @xmath85 to fit the envelope of the spin - echo oscillations and extract @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4c shows @xmath87 , as obtained by taking the power spectral density of the @xmath75 vs time signal , and the calculated equivalent input detector noise @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical calculation of the sensitivity taking into account the finite measurement fidelity and the experimentally characterized decoherence during the spin echo sequence predicts a flat noise spectrum with a value of @xmath89 , in good agreement with the experimentally measured value of @xmath90 at high frequency . in the low - frequency region , excess noise is observed due to electronics drifts and interference . for fast detection , the equivalent flux noise </S>",
    "<S> is largely dominated by the value in the high frequency limit . for magnetic field detection </S>",
    "<S> , the sensitivity can be expressed as @xmath91 , yielding @xmath92 .    the detection sensitivity obtained above </S>",
    "<S> is partly limited by the large ratio @xmath93 , as imposed by @xmath94 , required to initialize the qubit by energy relaxation . to reduce the overhead time </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce another measurement scheme in which we use the correlator @xmath95 as the detector output , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 two consecutive measurement results at steps @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by the fact that an ideal projective readout prepares the qubit in an energy eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement result @xmath96 is random . </S>",
    "<S> however , the product @xmath100 only depends on qubit evolution if energy relaxation is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> our measurement has a limited efficiency and the projection fidelity is lower for @xmath54 due to energy relaxation during measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the repetition time of the sequence @xmath13 is experimentally optimized to balance two competing effects : a long @xmath13 results in additional qubit relaxation , which reduces qubit projection when @xmath54 ; a short @xmath13 leads to additional decoherence of the qubit , presumably due to photon number fluctuations in the resonator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an optimum detection efficiency for @xmath101 and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the magnetic field noise referred to detector output using @xmath103 , similar to the scheme based on qubit reset using energy relaxation . </S>",

    "<S> 4f . </S>",
    "<S> a significant improvement of sensitivity is achieved compared to the result obtained using qubit reset by relaxation , as shown in fig 4c . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent flux noise , averaged over the full frequency interval , is @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> excess noise is observed at low frequency as well , however the magnitude is significantly lower than for the data shown in fig .  4c , due to the fact that low frequency fluctuations in the detection system are removed by using the correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field detection sensitivity reaches @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the improvement in detection efficiency is due primarily to the reduction in duty cycle .        </S>",
    "<S> these results establish the pcq as an ultrasensitive ac magnetic field detector . in the following a discussion </S>",
    "<S> is given of how our detector compares with other types of sensors . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the comparison with dc - squids and atom - based detectors . for dc - squids , </S>",
    "<S> the proper figure of merit related to magnetometry applications is the energy sensitivity @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the loop inductance of the dc - squid  @xcite . this same figure of merit is adapted to the pcq , since similar magnetic field coupling methods can be used . in dc - squids </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath109 is dominated at low frequency by flux noise and reaches a constant value in the high frequency region , which is taken as the relevant figure for noise . by energy sensitivity , </S>",
    "<S> our detector , with a loop inductance @xmath110 , compares favorably with the dc - squids in  @xcite and  @xcite operated at temperatures of @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that optimization of the energy sensitivity in our case can in principle be done by increasing the loop inductance , as flux noise was observed in general not to scale up with loop size , an aspect favourable for magnetometry  @xcite .    for a comparison with atomic magnetometers and nv center based detectors </S>",
    "<S> the most adapted figure of merit is the quantity @xmath113 , which combines the sensitivity @xmath15 and the detector volume @xmath19  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> atomic magnetometers based on vapour cells have very high sensitivity , achieved usually with volumes of the order of @xmath114 , when numbers of the order of @xmath115  @xcite are reached . when extrapolated to volumes of @xmath116 , corresponding to the pcq detector used in this work , the ultimate theoretical limit to sensitivity is of the order of @xmath117  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , magnetic field detection based on cold atoms has been explored as well  @xcite . using a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , a sensitivity of @xmath118 for a measurement area of @xmath119 </S>",
    "<S> was obtained in  @xcite . the fundamental limit for sensing using a bec with a resolution of a few micrometers  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is in the @xmath120 range . </S>",
    "<S> we note that atomic magnetometers operate typically at low frequency , below 1  khz ; methods exist to extend the operation frequency to hundreds of khz  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nv centers in diamond  @xcite have recently emerged as an ultrasensitive method for magnetometry . </S>",
    "<S> they combine the advantage of the possibility to work at room temperature and a spatial resolution that can be changed from the nanometer range ( for single nv center operation )  @xcite up to large scale by using a spin ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> decoherence due to paramagnetic impurities limits the flux detection efficiency to @xmath121 , optimal for ac fields at frequencies of the order of 100  khz  @xcite , which results in a sensitivity of @xmath122 for a detection volume of the order of @xmath123 .     * </S>",
    "<S> magnetic flux and field detection sensitivity - present results and ideal case . * the calculated sensitivity for a pcq for the case of ideal measurements and with a flux noise of @xmath124 is given for the case of a relaxation time @xmath125 ( continuous line ) and for the case of negligible relaxation time ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results reported here are indicated by the red cross ( qubit reset done by energy relaxation ) and blue dot ( correlation measurements).,width=297 ]    detection of magnetic fields using the pcq was demonstrated here for ac magnetic fields at @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> detection over a wide range of frequencies is possible . at a given frequency @xmath69 , </S>",
    "<S> optimizing the detection sensitivity requires tuning of the magnetic moment of the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved in situ by changing the qubit transition frequency @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal sensitivity for a pcq is calculated here with a set of realistic assumptions on parameters and feasible improvements of control and decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the persistent current @xmath23 and minimum energy level splitting @xmath128 are taken to have values as the pcq in this experiment . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , ideal projective measurements are used ; projective measurements nearly reaching perfect fidelity have been demonstrated for superconducting qubits ( see _ eg _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the duty cycle ( @xmath129 ) is set equal to one . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by shortening readout times , as enabled by nearly quantum limited amplifiers  @xcite , and by replacing spin - echo sequence with more complex control pulse schemes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , qubit pure dephasing is assumed to be limited by 1/f flux noise ( see  @xcite ) , with a spectral density given by @xmath130 $ ] , which is the value that would explain the observed spin echo decay time at @xmath37 in our experiment if flux noise was the only noise contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this level of flux noise is larger than measured values in smaller area superconducting rings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is very likely that in our experiment the flux noise is significantly lower than this upper bound and that charge noise plays a major role , due to the low josephson energy in this device . </S>",
    "<S> straightforward changes in design will allow reducing the influence of charge noise to negligible levels . with these assumptions taken into account , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated optimal sensitivity is plotted in figure  5 for a pcq with an energy relaxation time of @xmath131 ( attained in  @xcite ) and for the case where relaxation is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation shows that with respect to the experimental results reported here , more than one order of magnitude of improvement is possible by feasible changes of the experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> the detection efficiency decreases with frequency , due to the ultimate limit imposed by 1/f noise . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this detector has a very high intrinsic sensitivity for measurements in the range from tens of khz to tens of mhz . </S>",
    "<S> possible future developments on increase of coherence times of superconducting qubits will increase the efficiency and the useful frequency range even further .    in conclusion , we demonstrated a high sensitivity magnetometer based on an artificial atom . </S>",
    "<S> the high magnetic field sensitivity combined with the micron spatial resolution is relevant to applications such as detection of electron spin resonance , scanning probe microscopy , and sensitive current and voltage amplifiers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this detector is particularly interesting for exploring the dynamics of quantum systems at low temperatures with minimal backaction . </S>",
    "<S> the results here illustrate the potential that artificial quantum systems have for quantum sensing . </S>"
