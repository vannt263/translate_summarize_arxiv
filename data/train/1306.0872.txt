    "there are several established schemes to generate a synthetic magnetic field for charge - neutral ultra cold atoms . here",
    "we provide some details of the corresponding hamiltonians in these schemes . in the scheme developed in nist",
    "@xcite , a landau gauge type artificial vector potential was generated by coupling different hyperfine states of the atoms through raman lasers , which transfers momentum only along the @xmath80 direction .",
    "the coupling can vary spatially and leads to the effective single atom hamiltonian h = h_1(k_x)+[^2(k_y^2+k_z^2)/2m+v(r ) ] , where h_1(k_x)=. here @xmath81 is the engineered vector potential and @xmath82 is the fictitious charge . in this case",
    "if the system size is sufficiently large and one considers the bulk of the system , the hamiltonian resembles that for the charged particle in magnetic field , but with the vector potential in landau gauge .",
    "this hamiltonian is same as the atomic hamiltonian we used in the main paper .    in another set of schemes the trap that contains the ultra cold atom",
    "is rotated with the help of a moving laser beam @xcite about a particular axis .",
    "the corresponding problem is considered in the co - rotating frame where the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics holds .",
    "the corresponding single particle hamiltonian can be written as _ l= + m_xy^2(x^2 + y^2 ) + m_z^2z^2 - * .r*. [ ham1 ] we assume that the axis of rotation is along @xmath83 and also the system is very tightly trapped along the @xmath83-axis , such that it is always in the ground state of the harmonic trap potential along the @xmath83-direction . under this situation the dynamics along @xmath83-axis is frozen and the motion is essentially two dimensional and confined to the xy plane such that an effective two dimensional hamiltonian can replace [ ham1 ] ( without the term @xmath84 ) giving h_l & = & ( * |p|^2 * - 2m*p.r * + |*r*|^2 ) + m_xy^2(x^2 + y^2 ) + & = & ^2 + m(_xy^2 - ^2)(x^2 + y^2 ) , [ hle ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for a fast rotating condensate ,",

    "this resembles the hamiltonian for a charged particle in magnetic field written in symmetric gauge and again is same as the one used as the atomic hamiltonian in the main paper .",
    "the current paper talks about the effect of synthetic magnetic field on a degenerate fermi gas which is almost non - interacting @xcite and we do not consider the case of bosonic or fermionic superfluid .",
    "it is important to mention here that for such ultra cold atomic superfluid , particularly in the case of bosons , the effect of rotation will create strongly correlated many body vortex state in such system and the observation of landau level physics under typical experimental condition is difficult @xcite and the nist scheme is better suited for such system to observe landau level physics .",
    "it is not possible to comment at this stage for a trapped atomic system inside a cavity which of these methods will be more suitable to generate synthetic magnetic field .",
    "however the results we obtained in this paper are independent of choices of synthetic gauge potential .",

    "the velocity is @xmath90 , and position of the center of cyclotron orbit , called guiding center coordinate is = * r*+ .",
