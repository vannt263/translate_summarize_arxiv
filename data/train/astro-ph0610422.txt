    "characterizing the microscopic properties of spacetime using images of distant sources was first proposed in a letter by @xcite .",
    "this compelling possibility is a consequence of a phenomenon likely to be found at the planck scale , where lengths shrink to @xmath0 m and time intervals diminish to @xmath1 s. following @xcite , here distance measurements @xmath2 are uncertain by @xmath3 ( with similar uncertainties for time ) , where the parameter @xmath4 specifies different quantum gravity models .",
    "a natural choice for @xmath4 is 1 , but @xmath5 is also possible @xcite , and @xmath6 is preferred @xcite , because it is consistent with the holographic principle of @xcite and established black - hole theory @xcite .",
    "an electromagnetic wave travelling a distance @xmath7 from source to observer would be continually subjected to these random spacetime fluctuations , which following @xcite leads to a cumulative statistical phase dispersion of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the observed wavelength , and @xmath10 is close to unity .",
    "this presents a means of detection in an image of a point source .",
    "@xcite point out that @xmath11 can be interpreted as an apparent angular broadening of the source , and over a sufficient distance might grow enough to obliterate the diffraction pattern at the focal plane of a telescope .    because this has not been seen in",
    "_ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) data , lieu et al . and",
    "other authors @xcite have concluded that the effect , if present , is too weak to be observed . in section",
    "[ limits ] i expand on previous work to account for the shorter wavelength of emitted light , which predicts stronger blurring . but",
    "observing this is still problematic , because it must be disentangled from a partially resolved source .",
    "a test is outlined in section  [ selection ] which makes use of the best available archival data , a _ hst _",
    "snapshot survey of @xmath12 quasars .",
    "these data are discussed in section  [ reductions ] , after which a new analysis in the context of blurring by planck - scale effects is presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "equation 1 assumes that the emission and detection wavelengths are the same , and so represents a minimal estimate for blurring . for cosmological distances",
    ", photons left the source at the shorter wavelength @xmath13 , for which the blurring action of the planck scale should be stronger .",
    "consider the following : @xmath14 one might call this a maximal estimate , because it assumes the bluest possible photons propagate a distance @xmath7 and are then detected at wavelength @xmath9 .",
    "it is instructive to write equation 2 in a different form . by taking its differential with respect to @xmath15 ,",
    "it is possible to rewrite it as @xmath16 } dz \\big{\\}}\\ ] ] @xmath17 where the luminosity distance @xmath7 is given by @xmath18 } \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] and @xmath19 is the deceleration parameter . by comparison with equation 1 , the first integral can be recognized as the observed phase dispersion of photons of wavelength @xmath9 arriving from all redshifts up to the source . in practice",
    "these could conceivably come from intervening sources along the line of sight , hence the label @xmath20 .",
    "the second integral must then be the remaining phase dispersion @xmath21 associated exclusively with photons redshifted to the observer s wavelength .",
    "the latter scenario seems the more plausible .",
    "this is plotted in figure  [ figure_multiwavelength ] for a @xmath22 point source as a function of observed wavelength using the standard lcdm cosmology ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ) assumed throughout this paper .",
    "three other possibilities are also plotted : minimal blurring @xmath11 , the combination of minimal blurring of the source plus that of intermediate sources along its line of sight @xmath26 , and maximal blurring @xmath27 , for a total of four .",
    "following @xcite i use @xmath28 and @xmath29 . reducing ( increasing ) @xmath10 shifts these lines in parrallel towards lower left ( upper right ) in this plot , as does increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath4 .",
    "the most dramatic changes come with variation in @xmath4 , by virtue of it appearing as an exponent in equations 1 and 3 .    can blurring be constrained by current observations ?",
    "figure  [ figure_multiwavelength ] illustrates at what wavelengths an answer may be most convincing .",
    "the highest spatial resolutions of some current telescopes are indicated .",
    "chandra routinely observes sources to a resolution limit better than that imposed by either equations 1 or 3 for @xmath28 .",
    "but this conflict is easily avoided , by either suitably increasing @xmath4 ( 0.7 would be sufficient ) or reducing @xmath10 - or both .",
    "this flexibility is allowed because current telescopes operating shortward of the optical ( including chandra ) do not form diffraction - limited images , and so it may be more difficult to distinguish blurring induced by the planck scale from simply an unresolved source such as a galaxy .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the angular size @xmath30 of extended @xmath22 sources for a range of physical diameters .",
    "thus , it may be best to look for blurring in the optical .",
    "_ hst _ probes a regime predicted to be blurry , which is indicated by the shaded regions .",
    "it can also resolve sources confirmed to be physically small at other wavelengths .",
    "for example , if @xmath28 and subject to the maximum blurring limit , no @xmath22 source should appear sharper than about 01 across at 800 nm , broad enough to affect the _ hst _ diffraction pattern .",
    "an object with @xmath22 would need to be 500 pc across to mimic this level of broadening .",
    "this is smaller than a typical galaxy , but not quasars .",
    "even if it were a factor of about 2.5 less , _ hst _ could still marginally discriminate between planck - scale - induced blurring and the effects of a 200 pc source .",
    "but a @xmath31-m space telescope would be needed to rule out the minimum set by equation 1 , by resolving objects as small as 50 pc .",
    "@xcite have already confirmed that the most severe blurring discussed in section  [ limits ] is not seen in _ hst _",
    "images of a @xmath32 hubble deep field galaxy .",
    "it is worth considering how weak blurring could be and still be ruled out for _ hst_. ragazonni et al .",
    "point out that small perturbations of the phase should only cause a drop in image strehl ratio @xmath33 .",
    "this is the ratio of the image peak to that of the diffraction spike of an unabberated telescope . in this case , and where @xmath34 is comparable to the telescope optical aberrations , the marechal approximation to the strehl ratio applies , and @xmath35}}. \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] figure  [ figure_models ] is a plot of point - source strehl ratio as a function of redshift for an unaberrated telescope with @xmath36 m observing at @xmath37 nm . the shaded regions have the same meaning as in figure  [ figure_multiwavelength ] , again plotted for @xmath28 and @xmath29 . if the object is not a true point source but is actually extended , equations 1 and 3 do not strictly apply . in this case the strehl ratio of the image would also drop due to the partial resolution of the source . for an object of angular size @xmath30 close to the diffraction limit of the telescope one would expect a strehl ratio of @xmath38 } } \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] in the absense of planck - scale effects .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ figure_models ] represent equation 6 for various source diameters .",
    "judging from figure  [ figure_models ] , to test if high - redshift sources are indeed blurred , one could look at a large homogeneous sample of compact high - redshift objects imaged with _",
    "hst_. in principle , the test is simple : is there a downward trend in strehl ratio with increasing source redshift ?",
    "in practice , two factors must be well controlled .",
    "first , the sample must be of uniformly small sources of very high redshift .",
    "figure  [ figure_models ] indicates that for any planck - scale effect to be detected with _",
    "hst _ the sample must extend to redshifts well beyond @xmath22 .",
    "second , the point - spread function ( psf ) must be well characterized because the planck - scale - blurring signal is relative to the expectation for diffraction - limited imaging .    as it turns out , there is already at least one archival _ hst _",
    "dataset that meets these strict critera : the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) high - resolution channel ( hrc ) snapshot survey of sdss quasars .",
    "this was a program of imaging to detect lensed companions among a sample of @xmath39 quasars .",
    "none were found despite the excellent spatial resolution afforded by acs hrc . because depth was not as important as spatial resolution ,",
    "these images are relatively shallow , which should minimize confusion by any extended host galaxy .",
    "also , @xcite suggest that none of the sdss quasars should have a broad - line region larger than a few parsecs , which would make equation 6 negligibly less than unity for _ hst_. thus , this sample should satisfy the first condition . that they also satisfy the second is a property of both _",
    "hst _ psf stability and the nyquist - sampled acs hrc pixel scale . neither the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) nor the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) can fulfill this second constraint .",
    "the archival _ hst _ acs snapshot survey of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) sources ( proposal : 9472 , pi : strauss ) includes all sdss quasars with @xmath12 ; some of which have @xmath40 .",
    "they were obtained in snapshot mode through either the f775w filter ( central wavelength 761 nm , 95 sources , @xmath41 ) or f850lp ( 869 nm , 4 sources , @xmath42 ) .",
    "all were imaged with the hrc , which has a pixel scale of 00246 .",
    "these data have already been discussed in detail in @xcite , and those reductions are closely followed here .",
    "pipeline - processed images were downloaded from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "this provides standard corrections for overscan , bias , and dark - current , flatfield division , bad - pixel masking , cosmic - ray removal , and photometric calibration .",
    "the position of the quasar was determined to the nearest pixel using the iraf program imexam .",
    "next , the tiny tim ( v6.3 ) program @xcite was used to generate an appropriate psf for each . due to the strong positional dependence of the hrc field distortion",
    "this produces a more accurate psf than can be determined by images of stars .",
    "color dependence is also properly accounted for , by inputing a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and convolving this with the _ hst _ filter curve .",
    "synthetic psfs were generated for each quasar using a redshifted template sed based on a composite sdss qso spectrum @xcite . by shifting in the fourier domain ,",
    "the sub - pixel position and peak of the psf were allowed to float relative to the image , and minimized based on the sum of the square of residuals .",
    "the result is an unique psf for each quasar , correct for its detector position , filter bandpass , and sed .",
    "all of the images were then co - aligned to the center of the nearest pixel .",
    "figure  [ figure_images ] shows the result for sdss j0836 + 0054 ( @xmath43 ) , which will serve as an example .",
    "each box is 3@xmath44 3  with the same orientation as in @xcite ( their figure 2 ) .",
    "all images have the same grey - scale stretch .",
    "the non - circular first airy ring is clearly evident , and further rings would be visible in a harder stretch . the diffraction pattern of a circularly symmetric @xmath45-m diameter pupil with a @xmath46-m central obstruction is also shown .",
    "note that this excludes any aberrations associated with the acs camera , which explains its circular symmetry .",
    "the same sed as the quasar was used .",
    "it is relative to this ideal diffraction pattern that - by definition - the strehl ratio of the quasar and psf is to be determined .",
    "next to this is the psf residual ( the model residual will be discussed later , in section  [ results ] ) .",
    "this residual is robust against variation in the template sed , both in relative line strengths and choice of continuum power law .",
    "it is also , as can be expected , comparable to that obtained by richards et al . and reveals no obvious host galaxy or lensed component . but",
    "underlying effects due to microlensing can not be ruled out , although it is not clear what effect they may have .",
    "results are similar for the other sources .",
    "strehl ratio was then measured , which is not reported by @xcite .",
    "each image and psf was normalized to a flux of unity based on synthetic aperture photometry , and the height of its peak determined relative to the ideal diffraction pattern .",
    "the accuracy of the final measurement is to within a few percent , which is the level of photometric uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ figure_strehl ] is a plot of strehl ratio ; crosses indicate the psf .",
    "the unfortunate division between the f775w and f850lp data at @xmath47 is evident . even if one ignores this , a clear downward trend with increasing source redshift",
    "can be seen , despite some scatter in the data .",
    "overplotted is a linear least - squares fit to these , which has slope of @xmath48 ( 1-@xmath49 errors ) . that some of the lowest redshift quasars have strehl ratios higher than the psf indicates that the limits of the telescope have been reached here .",
    "the differences of a few percent are consistent with the uncertainties in the measurements .",
    "thus , the decrement below the psf strehl ratio for the @xmath50 redshift sources is probably real .",
    "the situation for the @xmath51 sources is more secure .",
    "limits predicted by equations 1 and 3 assuming @xmath28 and @xmath29 are overplotted .",
    "the break is due to the change in filter effective wavelength , from 761 nm to 869 nm . for this choice of @xmath10 and @xmath4 , both @xmath27 and @xmath26",
    "are clearly ruled out . but blurring associated with just redshifted sources is not .",
    "it is striking how closely the maximum strehl ratio follows this curve . and of those quasars for which the psf should be sharp enough to allow it , none are found in the region that it borders .",
    "if this is correct , it places a tight constraint on @xmath4 . even if @xmath52 , @xmath4 need only grow by 2% ( to 0.68 ) and still be in agreement with the data .",
    "although also possible , this result is not easily explained by the size of the sources alone .",
    "it would seem that the intrisic sizes of these quasars ( either their narrow - line or broad - line regions - or both ) would need to occupy a very narrow range for this to happen , between about 200 pc and 300 pc .    in a further simple test of the internal consistency of the @xmath51 results ,",
    "a simple  blurred \" quasar model was generated .",
    "guided by the good fit of @xmath21 in figure  [ figure_strehl ] , the existing psf was cropped slightly below its peak , at a cutoff given by @xmath53}}$ ] .",
    "a value @xmath54 nm was used , for @xmath36 m. this naive model is indeed a better fit to the observed strehl ratio , indicated by the open triangles in figure  [ figure_strehl ] .",
    "the effects on the residual are benign , which can be seen in figure  [ figure_images ] .",
    "this is also evident in slices along the x and y axes , which are plotted in figure  [ figure_profiles ] .",
    "this confirms that the blurred quasar model is a better fit than the original psf , accomplished without adversely affecting the residual .",
    "this is reassuring , as it demonstrates that these results are not in conflict with those of @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "i have searched for blurring induced by the effects of the planck scale in _ hst _ images of high-@xmath15 quasars .",
    "although blurring may be seen , if real , it is just at the observable threshold .",
    "the test here is more sensitive than previous ones , which only looked for compact sources lacking diffraction rings .",
    "the shorter wavelength of emitted light has also been accounted for , which if correct , restricts @xmath4 to be 0.68 even if @xmath10 is as big as 10 .    the implications of blurring are significant , so it is worth looking for .",
    "a true detection could point to a successful quantum gravity theory .",
    "but detection is elusive because the signal is confused with that of a partially resolved source .",
    "it is hoped that this work will encourage further tests for the effect with _ hst_. a first step would be to re - observe the four @xmath51 quasars in this sample with the hrc and the f775w filter .",
    "observations of higher-@xmath15 quasars ( as they become known ) could ultimately confirm or refute the current result .",
