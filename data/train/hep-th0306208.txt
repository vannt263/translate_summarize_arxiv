    "the cosmological constant is one of the most outstanding mysteries in contemporary physics  @xcite .",
    "there are actually two cosmological constant problems .",
    "one is the `` old '' problem : `` why is the cosmological constant vanishingly small compared to the energy scale of , say , the planck scale ? '' the ratio of the critical density of the universe today , than which energy density of the cosmological constant must be smaller , to the planckian energy density is as small as @xmath0 .",
    "since the cosmological constant is not protected against quantum corrections , there is no manifest reason why it should be so tiny .",
    "we now have the second problem : `` why is the dark energy roughly of the same order as matter energy density today ? ''",
    "the observation of high - redshift , type ia supernovae is strongly inconsistent with a universe with vanishing dark energy , whose typical form is a cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "this implies that there should be a small but non - vanishing dark energy and that it should be comparable to matter energy density today .",
    "however , since dark energy and matter scale differently as the universe expands , there seems to be no manifest reason why they should be of the same order today .",
    "this problem is often called the coincidence problem .",
    "although there are many approaches to the coincidence problem  @xcite , all of them seem to have a common weakness : they can be spoiled by other contributions to the cosmological constant .",
    "this is because it is a priori assumed that the old problem can be solved .",
    "a tiny correction to the unknown solution to the old problem can produce a relatively huge cosmological constant .",
    "for example , in the quintessence scenario  @xcite it is a priori assumed that the asymptotic value of the quintessence potential exactly vanishes . if we added a non - vanishing cosmological constant to the potential then the scenario would not work .",
    "moreover , if there are many proposals to solve the coincidence problem and if they can coexist then we will end up with a too much cosmological constant , provided that each contribution is additive .",
    "hence , a good solution to the coincidence problem must include a mechanism which almost completely cancels other contributions to the cosmological constant .",
    "unfortunately , no phenomenologically acceptable solution with such a mechanism is known .",
    "there are also many approaches to the old problem . among them",
    "are quantum cosmology  @xcite , membrane creation  @xcite , a scalar field with a very small mass  @xcite , backreaction models  @xcite , eternal inflation  @xcite , extra dimensions  @xcite , and so on  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the quantum cosmology approach based on the euclidean quantum gravity partly because it is not well understood and may be ill - defined .",
    "( for example , see refs .",
    "@xcite for challenging arguments .",
    ") there is another reason why we do not consider this approach .",
    "quantum cosmology is , in a sense , a theory of the beginning , or the initial condition , of the universe .",
    "for example , the hartle - hawking boundary condition  @xcite predicts a sharp peak at a vanishing cosmological constant , but this value should be considered as the effective cosmological constant at the beginning of the universe , including all contributions from many fields and quantum corrections .",
    "hence , if this prediction is correct then the universe can not experience inflation nor any phase transitions after its birth .",
    "if the effective cosmological constant were zero at the beginning of the universe and if a phase transition occurred after that then the cosmological constant now would be negative .",
    "if we try to avoid this disagreeable conclusion by modifying or changing the proposal then the peak must be moved to a non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "for example , the proposals of linde  @xcite and vilenkin  @xcite prefer a large cosmological constant .",
    "this indicates the onset of a planck scale inflation , but does not seem to provide a solution to the cosmological constant problem without anthropic consideration  @xcite .",
    "a proposal by rubakov  @xcite might relax the cosmological constant in the brans - dicke frame to a small value if the cosmological constant in the einstein frame is exactly zero .",
    "however , for his proposal to work , it is essential to include an inflaton sector in the einstein frame .",
    "hence , we anyway need to explain why the cosmological constant in the einstein frame is exactly zero today .",
    "a similar proposal by hebecker and wetterich  @xcite not only has a similar problem but also predicts a too much deviation from einstein theory for weak gravity and , thus , is phenomenologically unacceptable .",
    "dolgov s backreaction model  @xcite and its variants  @xcite use the kinetic energy of a running scalar field to cancel the bare cosmological constant . in these models the effective gravitational coupling vanishes and , thus , the deviation from einstein gravity is too large .",
    "as far as the author knows , all other previously known approaches to the old cosmological constant problem are either dependent of the anthropic principle or phenomenologically unacceptable ( eg . a non - standard friedmann equation at low energy , a non - einstein weak gravity , a naked singularity , etc . ) .",
    "this situation has led to an increase in speculation for the necessity of the anthropic principle  @xcite . before resorting to this , it is worthwhile to ask whether anything could possibly do what the cosmological constant data requires  @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that the correct way to interpret the tiny value of the cosmological constant is that conventional quantum field theory is not the whole story , so it is worth seeking acceptable modifications .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a new dynamical approach to the cosmological constant problem was proposed .",
    "although this idea by itself does not explain why the cosmological constant is so small , it does provide a way to protect a zero or small cosmological constant against radiative corrections ( without using supersymmetry ) and thus can help solving the cosmological constant problem . in this approach",
    "the true value of the vacuum energy is negative , but the dynamics is such that the true minimum is never attained , and the universe settles down to a near zero energy state .    the purpose of the present paper is to investigate stability and gravity in this dynamical approach .",
    "in particular , we show that ( i ) the effective cosmological constant decreases in time and asymptotically approaches zero from above ; ( ii ) the evolution of a homogeneous , isotropic universe is described by the standard friedmann equation at low energy ; that ( iii ) classical , linearized gravity in minkowski background is described by einstein gravity at distances longer than @xmath1 and at energies lower than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the planck length and @xmath4 is a dimensionless , positive parameter of the model ; that ( iv ) the mechanism is stable under radiative corrections and thus a zero or small cosmological constant is protected against radiative corrections ; and that ( v ) quantum fluctuation at low energy is so small that the effective cosmological constant at low energy does not overshoot zero even quantum mechanically .",

    "one of the most disturbing difficulties in thinking about the cosmological constant is that it is not protected against radiative corrections , which usually generate enormous vacuum energies compared to what we observe .",
    "the feedback mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be considered as a dynamical way to protect a zero or small cosmological constant against radiative corrections .",
    "hence , although the feedback mechanism by itself does not solve the cosmological constant problem , it can help solving the problem . in this section",
    "we explain the basic idea underlying the feedback mechanism .",
    "let us consider a simple system of a non - relativistic , charged particle in a background electrostatic potential .",
    "the action of this simple system is @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the electrostatic potential .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath7 is an increasing function of @xmath8 so that the particle moves towards the negative @xmath8 region .",
    "suppose , however , that for some reason , we would like to stop the particle just before its crossing @xmath9 .",
    "how can we stop it ?",
    "one obvious solution is to control the electrostatic potential so that it has a minimum near @xmath9 , and introduce a friction . by controlling the potential and the friction carefully ,",
    "we can achieve our purpose .",
    "a difficulty in this solution is that there might be forces ( eg .",
    "strong wind , gravity , someone who may kick the particle , etc . ) other than the electrostatic force and the friction .",
    "these forces make the control of the potential extremely subtle and difficult .    a different , rather radical solution would be available if we could control the mass @xmath10 of the particle . in this case",
    "we make @xmath10 to diverge when @xmath8 is sufficiently close to @xmath9 . to make this successful",
    "we of course need to watch the value of @xmath8 in real time .",
    "this case does not involve a subtle control of anything : @xmath8 completely stops when @xmath10 diverges , irrespective of the value of @xmath11 and other forces .",
    "one might worry that the kinetic term in the action might diverge .",
    "actually , this is not the case , and the kinetic term does not diverge but vanishes .",
    "since the equation of motion of the position @xmath8 of the charged particle is @xmath12 the momentum @xmath13 remains finite in finite time as far as @xmath11 is finite .",
    "( this is the reason why @xmath8 stops when @xmath10 diverges . ) hence , the kinetic term actually vanishes when @xmath10 diverges : @xmath14 indeed , the more singular the mass is , the more quickly the kinetic term vanishes",
    ".    we apply this second idea to a scalar field , whose potential determines the effective cosmological constant but is not fine - tuned .",
    "the reason why we do not consider a fine - tuned potential , or the analogue of the first idea above , is that it is not stable under radiative corrections , which add vacuum energies to the potential and also change the form of the potential .",
    "we still want to stop the scalar field at or near zero cosmological constant .",
    "let us suppose that a scalar field @xmath15 is described by the action @xmath16 ,    \\label{eqn : simple - action}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is chosen so that it vanishes at or near zero cosmological constant . a simple choice might be to make @xmath17 dependent of the value of @xmath15 itself so that @xmath17 vanishes at a root of the potential . in this case ,",
    "@xmath15 stops when the potential vanishes . however , this choice is too naive and would not be stable under radiative corrections : radiative corrections add vacuum energies to the potential and , hence , change the potential value at which @xmath15 stops . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath17 is a function of @xmath15 only then we can always make a change of variable @xmath18 so that the kinetic term of the new variable @xmath19 is canonically normalized . in this language , the choice of @xmath17 is nothing but a fine tuning of the potential of @xmath19 and , thus , this is never stable against radiative corrections .",
    "hence , we can not protect zero or small cosmological constant against radiative corrections if @xmath17 depends only on @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , @xmath15 itself does not know where to stop .",
    "on the other hand , the spacetime curvature seems to know where to stop @xmath15 since it reflects the value of the effective cosmological constant via the friedmann equation .",
    "hence , instead of considering a @xmath15-dependent @xmath17 , we postulate that @xmath17 depends on the spacetime curvature so that the curvature can tell when @xmath15 should stop . for simplicity , we restrict our discussion to the case where @xmath17 depends on the ricci scalar @xmath20 only and vanishes at @xmath21 . in this case , @xmath15 stops rolling when @xmath21 .",
    "we do not provide a reason why @xmath17 vanishes at @xmath21 .",
    "however , we shall show that this choice of @xmath17 is stable under radiative corrections and leads to a stable dynamics .",
    "in other words , instead of providing a solution to the cosmological constant problem , we propose a dynamical mechanism to protect a zero or small cosmological constant against radiative corrections ( without using supersymmetry ) as a first step .",
    "the singular kinetic term makes the scalar field stop at zero curvature , even without a fine - tuned potential .    with this choice of @xmath17",
    ", we need to make it sure that @xmath21 really corresponds to zero cosmological constant .",
    "if the kinetic term dominates over the potential term then the value of the potential determined by @xmath21 does not need to be zero and , thus , this model does not seem to work .",
    "hence , we are left with the following two possibilities .",
    "one possibility is that there is a scaling solution to scalar dynamics in which the kinetic and potential energies of the scalar field decrease in tandem , so that the field is slowed down when small potential energy is achieved .",
    "unfortunately , in our specific realizations , there always seems an instability invalidating the scaling solutions we tried .",
    "the second possibility , which we shall focus on in the rest of this paper , is that the potential term dominates over the kinetic term so that @xmath20 is determined solely by the contribution from the potential . in this case",
    ", the scalar field indeed stops at zero cosmological constant automatically .",
    "we could make @xmath17 dependent of @xmath15 as well , but such a dependence can be removed from the behavior of the kinetic term near @xmath21 by redefinition of @xmath15 without loss of generality .",
    "we suppose that the kinetic term in ( [ eqn : simple - action ] ) represents the term which is the most singular - looking at @xmath21 among many possible terms in the kinetic part and we did not include less singular - looking terms since they are not important at low energy .",
    "we also omitted all other dynamical fields since , as we shall see in the following sections , the dynamics of @xmath15 is so slow that any dynamical fields other than @xmath15 will settle into their ground state before the universe approaches a sufficiently low energy state .",
    "the potential @xmath22 includes the ground state energies of all such fields .",
    "since @xmath17 is in the denominator and vanishes in the @xmath23 limit , the kinetic term threatens to be singular at low energy .",
    "moreover , since @xmath17 is a function of the ricci scalar @xmath20 , it introduces corrections to einstein equation and possibly destabilize the system . on the other hand , from the charged - particle analogue above , we have learned that a singular - looking kinetic term is actually regular .",
    "the same is true here !",
    "the more singular @xmath24 is , the smaller the kinetic term and corrections to einstein equation are !",
    "this rather counter - intuitive but very simple fact means that by making @xmath24 ( for the most singular - looking term ) sufficiently singular at @xmath21 , we can make corrections to einstein equation as small as we like .",
    "in particular , it is indeed possible to make the corrections due to the kinetic term much smaller than those from usual higher derivative terms like @xmath25 at low energy so that higher derivative corrections and stability are completely controlled by the usual higher derivative terms .",
    "note that if there are several ( or many ) terms in the kinetic part , we do not need to require the singular behavior for all coefficients : just one term is enough .",
    "in the previous section we have learned from a simple analogous system that a scalar field stops in a completely regular way when the coefficient of a kinetic term diverges . in this section",
    "we consider a scalar field with such a singular - looking kinetic term .",
    "the field lagrangian we consider is @xmath26 ,    \\nonumber\\\\   l_{kin } & = & \\frac{\\kappa^{-4}k^q}{2qf^{2q-1 } } ,    \\label{eqn : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a function of the ricci scalar @xmath20 , @xmath3 is the planck length , @xmath4 and @xmath27 are constants , and @xmath28 .",
    "our sign convention for the metric is @xmath29 . in a word ,",
    "the idea of this model is to assume a non - standard kinetic term .",
    "the dependence on curvature is what stalls the field at small cosmological constant .",
    "we can absorb any nonzero cosmological term into @xmath22 without loss of generality .",
    "we assume that ( i ) the minimum of the potential @xmath22 is negative ; that ( ii ) @xmath30 ; that ( iii ) @xmath31 ; and that ( iv ) the function @xmath32 is non - negative and behaves near @xmath21 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an integer satisfying @xmath35 in the @xmath36 limit , this choice of @xmath32 may be replaced by @xmath37 $ ] or similar functions .",
    "we suppose that the kinetic term in ( [ eqn : action ] ) is the most singular - looking one among many possible terms in the kinetic part .",
    "we assume that the most singular - looking term behaves like ( [ eqn : fine - tuning ] ) with the condition ( [ eqn : stability - cond ] ) , but other terms do not need to behave like that . if there are several terms in the kinetic part then the most singular - looking term is dominant and other terms are not important at low energy .",
    "thus , eg . adding the standard canonical kinetic term does not affect anything .",
    "since @xmath17 is in the denominator of the kinetic term and vanishes in the @xmath38 limit , the kinetic term threatens to be singular at low energy .",
    "we shall see below that the large @xmath34 makes @xmath15 evolve slowly , that the numerator @xmath39 vanishes more quickly than the denominator and that the kinetic term is actually regular .",
    "now let us explain the motivations for the assumptions ( i)-(iv ) .",
    "( i ) we would like to propose a mechanism in which the scalar field stops rolling at or near zero vacuum energy . for this purpose",
    ", the minimum of the potential @xmath22 should be negative so that @xmath22 has a root .",
    "( ii ) for the stability of inhomogeneous perturbations , it is necessary that the sound velocity squared @xmath40 is positive  @xcite . in our model",
    "this condition is reduced to @xmath30 .",
    "( iii ) the @xmath20-dependence of the kinetic term @xmath41 produces higher derivative corrections to einstein equation which might destabilize gravity . as we shall explain below , the term @xmath42 can stabilize gravity at low energy if @xmath4 is positive .",
    "( iv ) for the term @xmath42 to control the stability , we need to make it sure that the term @xmath42 is dominant over @xmath41 at low energy .",
    "as shown below , this is the case if and only if the condition ( [ eqn : stability - cond ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we do not know a parent theory that will provide our lagrangian as the low - energy effective theory .",
    "in particular , we do not give a reason why @xmath17 vanishes at @xmath21 .",
    "in this sense , this model by itself does not solve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "however , we shall show below that this choice of @xmath17 is radiatively stable , leads to a stable dynamics and could help solve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "we treat this model as a purely phenomenological suggestion that might motivate further research into the possible parent theory , which is presumably not based entirely on conventional four - dimensional field theory .",
    "we could make @xmath17 dependent of @xmath15 , but such a dependence can be removed from the behavior of @xmath41 near @xmath21 by redefinition of @xmath15 without loss of generality .",
    "note that @xmath41 above represents the term which is the most singular - looking at @xmath21 among many possible terms in the kinetic part and that we did not include less singular - looking terms since they are not important at low energy .",
    "we also omitted all other dynamical fields since , as we shall see below , the dynamics of @xmath15 is so slow that any dynamical fields other than @xmath15 will settle into their ground state before the universe approaches a sufficiently low energy state .",
    "we now argue that the lagrangian ( [ eqn : action ] ) gives a feedback mechanism that makes the field stall at or near zero vacuum energy .",
    "the argument for the @xmath43 case was already given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "let us simply generalize it to a general @xmath27 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "in the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background @xmath45 the equation of motion for a homogeneous @xmath15 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 , a dot denotes the time derivative and a prime applied to @xmath22 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "near @xmath48 , @xmath49 can be approximated by a linear function as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants .",
    "this approximation is extremely good since , as we shall see , @xmath15 rolls very slowly near @xmath48 and does not probe the global shape of the potential .    without any fine - tuning ,",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath51 should be of order unity .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eqn : eom - homogeneous - phi ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that @xmath56 approaches @xmath57 , if @xmath58 changes slowly compared to @xmath59 and is smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] for confirmation of this statement by numerical calculation .",
    "hence , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath61 is @xmath62    if the kinetic term is small compared to the potential term then the friedmann equation implies that @xmath63 and ( [ eqn : asymptotic - pi ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath64 hence , we obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant . from the condition ( [ eqn : stability - cond ] ) , @xmath67 and @xmath68 this result means that the field stalls near @xmath48 .",
    "see figs .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] and [ fig : lambda_long ] for confirmation of this behavior by numerical calculation .",
    "we have assumed that the kinetic energy is small compared to the potential energy . this assumption is easily verified . at low energy ( @xmath69 )",
    ", @xmath70 provided that @xmath71 .",
    "here , we have used the condition ( [ eqn : stability - cond ] ) to obtain the first inequality .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that the standard friedmann equation is valid at low energy .",
    "let us justify this assumption in the next section .",
    "we can also show the essential , and somewhat surprising result , that the standard friedmann equation is recovered at low energy , starting from the action ( [ eqn : action ] ) .",
    "there are higher derivative corrections to the einstein equation due to the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "since there are higher - derivative terms , the stability of the system is a non - trivial question . in order to see the non - triviality ,",
    "let us consider the klein - gordon equation @xmath72 as a standard equation and add @xmath73 to the right hand side .",
    "one might expect that the standard equation should be recovered whenever @xmath74 .",
    "actually , this is not true .",
    "the standard equation is certainly recovered in the @xmath74 limit if @xmath75 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath76 then the system has a tachyonic degree and is unstable .",
    "moreover , if @xmath77 crosses a root of @xmath78 then the system experiences a singularity ( @xmath79 diverges ) and the low energy effective theory can not be trusted unless a miracle cancellation occurs .    in our system , from the estimate of @xmath41 in ( [ eqn :",
    "lkin - is - small ] ) with ( [ eqn : stability - cond ] ) , @xmath41 is much smaller than @xmath42 ( @xmath80 ) at low energy if @xmath81 .",
    "hence , @xmath42 should dominate the higher derivative corrections and control the stability .",
    "for the theory @xmath82 , roughly speaking , the parameter @xmath4 plays the role of @xmath78 above ( including the sign ) and it is known that the low energy dynamics is stable if and only if @xmath83  @xcite . here , stability means that as the universe expands , the system keeps away from unphysical spurious solutions and approaches the standard low energy evolution asymptotically . if we did not include the term @xmath42 then , as we shall see below , @xmath41 would make the quantity corresponding to @xmath78 above to be negative essentially because @xmath32 is in the denominator . therefore our system should be stable and the standard friedmann equation should be recovered at low energy if and only if @xmath31 and ( [ eqn : stability - cond ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the equation of motion derived from the action ( [ eqn : action ] ) includes up to fourth order derivatives of the metric .",
    "however , since the friedmann equation is a constraint equation , it does not include the highest order derivatives of the metric .",
    "this means that the generalized friedmann equation describing a homogeneous , isotropic universe in our model includes derivatives of the metric only up to third order .",
    "hence , it should be of the following form .",
    "@xmath84 where the dimensionless coefficient @xmath85 is written in terms of ( @xmath58 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) , @xmath88 is the energy density of fields other than @xmath15 , @xmath89 is a part of the energy density of @xmath15 which would be obtained by neglecting the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath41 , @xmath90 is corrections to @xmath91 which depends on @xmath92 and @xmath93 but not on @xmath94 .",
    "we shall see the detailed form of the generalized friedmann equation soon .    in this form of the generalized friedmann equation , @xmath78 and @xmath90 characterize corrections to the standard friedmann equation .",
    "indeed , if @xmath95 and if @xmath96 then this equation reduces to the standard friedmann equation @xmath97 .",
    "however , this does not necessarily guarantees the recovery of the standard friedmann equation in the limit @xmath74 , @xmath98 . as in the above example of a klein - gordon equation with a higher derivative correction ,",
    "what makes the limit rather subtle is the sign of the coefficient @xmath78 of the highest order derivative term . as we shall see soon ,",
    "if @xmath78 approaches zero from the positive side then the standard friedmann equation is indeed recovered in the limit .",
    "this situation is somehow similar to having an infinitely massive extra degree of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath78 approaches zero from the negative side then the situation is similar to having an infinitely unstable tachyonic degree and , thus , the system is completely unstable .",
    "moreover , if @xmath78 reaches zero in finite time then the system encounters a singularity where @xmath99 diverges .",
    "hence , both the stability and the recovery of the standard friedmann equation require @xmath78 to be positive .    in our model",
    "there are two contributions to @xmath78 : one from @xmath41 and the other from @xmath42 .",
    "we shall see below that the first contribution is negative .",
    "this implies that the system would be unstable in the absence of the term @xmath42 and that we really need this term ( or other ordinary higher derivative terms ) . on the other hand",
    ", we shall see below that the sign of the second contribution is the same as the sign of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , as we have already seen in the previous section , @xmath41 is much smaller than @xmath100 and , thus , than @xmath42 at low energy .",
    "this means that the contribution from the @xmath42 term determines the sign of @xmath78 at low energy and that @xmath78 is positive if and only if @xmath4 is positive .",
    "therefore , if and only if @xmath4 is positive , the system is stable and the standard friedmann equation is recovered at low energy . in the following , we shall show this statement more explicitly .    for the stability analysis and numerical works , it is sometimes more convenient to work with a set of first order differential equations than a set of higher order differential equations . in the end of this section , we shall use the set of first - order equations to show the recovery of the standard friedmann equation analytically .",
    "some numerical results are shown in sec .",

    "moreover , the singular behavior of a kinetic term coefficient and , thus , the slow evolution of @xmath15 are required for stability .",
    "this does imply , however , that should this mechanism be responsible for a low cosmological constant , reheating would be required to thermally populate the universe after the cosmological constant has decreased to a small value . nonetheless , as we shall see below , this model can at the very least reduce fine - tuning by @xmath132 orders of magnitude or provide a new mechanism for sampling possible cosmological constants and implementing the anthropic principle .",
    "the reheat process requires further speculation , and is a subject for future research .",
    "a couple of possibilities are :    \\(i ) low - energy inflation .",
    "one can consider an extra scalar field @xmath133 with mass @xmath134 and a term like @xmath135 .",
    "when @xmath136 , a phase transition would occur ( as in hybrid inflation @xcite ) and the universe would be reheated up to temperature @xmath137 .",
    "this phase transition happens when the energy stored in @xmath133 plus the energy stored in @xmath15 yields a hubble constant of approximately @xmath138 .",
    "the energy in @xmath133 will decrease during the phase transition ; the energy after the phase transition must be very small . in this case",
    "the cosmological constant problem is reduced from @xmath139 to @xmath140 . for smaller @xmath138 ,",
    "the reheat temperature would be lower and the tuning of the cosmological constant would presumably be smaller .",
    "\\(ii ) energy inflow from extra dimensions .",
    "for example , in a non - elastic scattering of branes , a part of the kinetic energy due to the relative motion can be converted to radiation on our brane without changing the brane tension and the cosmological constant . for this to work",
    ", branes should be sufficiently flat and parallel .",
    "after reheating , the conventional standard cosmology with a vanishingly small cosmological constant can be restored .",
    "this is because the scalar field @xmath15 is just frozen at low energy .",
    "namely , @xmath141 can be made arbitrarily small at low energy ( @xmath69 ) by considering a sufficiently large @xmath34 , where @xmath87 is estimated by ( [ eqn : asymptotic - pi ] ) . in the scenario ( i ) , both @xmath61 and @xmath92 evolve continuously through the reheating epoch .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath142 and the @xmath143d cosmological constant does not overshoot zero within the present age of the universe if @xmath34 is large enough to ensure that @xmath144 $ ] , where @xmath145 is the value of the ricci scalar at reheating , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the expectation value of @xmath133 before and after the phase transition , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath71 .    on the other hand , in the scenario ( ii ) , while @xmath61 evolves continuously , @xmath92 increases suddenly by energy flow from the extra dimension .",
    "hence , @xmath92 in ( [ eqn : asymptotic - pi ] ) and ( [ eqn : vdot ] ) should be estimated before and after reheating , respectively .",
    "therefore , we obtain from ( [ eqn : vdot ] ) the following estimate for the period soon after reheating .",
    "@xmath148 where we have used the friedmann equation @xmath149 . here ,",
    "@xmath150 and @xmath151 are the hubble parameter before and after the energy inflow from extra dimensions , respectively . by using ( [ eqn : eom - b ] )",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath152 during the radiation - dominated epoch ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath154 decays from @xmath155 to @xmath156 in the time scale @xmath157 .",
    "thus , if @xmath34 is large enough to ensure that @xmath158 then @xmath49 does not overshoot zero in the time scale @xmath159 , provided that @xmath160 .",
    "after that , we can use the estimate ( [ eqn : dphi - small - i ] ) with @xmath92 being the realtime value , and @xmath49 does not overshoot zero if @xmath34 is sufficiently large .",
    "let us recall that a choice like @xmath37 $ ] corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "one might worry about symmetry restoration and phase transitions that occur after reheating .",
    "this is not a problem in both examples if @xmath34 is sufficiently large .",
    "the reason is that @xmath161 ( or @xmath125 , respectively ) is the cosmological constant at zero temperature since the temperature before the reheating is zero .",
    "the large @xmath34 ensures that @xmath162 is still positive and small since @xmath15 continues to be almost frozen all the way down to the present epoch including the time when the symmetry is restored and during the time the phase transition takes place .",
    "even if all else fails , although not our initial subjective , the existence of @xmath15 can at the very least provide a natural framework in which to implement the anthropic principle . if we assume eternal inflation , there would be many inflationary universes . in each universe ,",
    "the cosmological constant is determined by how much @xmath15 has rolled when inflation ends .",
    "that in turn depends on the number of @xmath163-foldings that occurred before inflation stopped . in an eternal inflation scenario",
    ", different numbers of @xmath163-foldings would occur in different domains and therefore different @xmath15 values , and hence different values of the cosmological constant would occur in different regions .",
    "our model in general predicts @xmath164 today because of ( [ eqn : dphi - small - i ] ) since pre- and post - reheating behavior requires a large @xmath34 . in the scenario ( i ) , @xmath165 continuously decreases . in the scenario ( ii ) , @xmath165 increases suddenly at reheating but is adjusted to the behavior ( [ eqn : dphi - small - i ] ) in the time scale @xmath159 .",
    "note that @xmath166 since @xmath167 .",
    "this means that the behavior ( [ eqn : dphi - small - i ] ) and @xmath168 are realized before the present stage of the universe .",
    "in this section , restricting to the @xmath43 case for simplicity , we show that linearized einstein gravity in a minkowski background is recovered at distances longer than the length scale @xmath1 and at energies lower than @xmath2 .",
    "the extension to general @xmath27 ( @xmath44 ) should be straightforward .",
    "a possible source of instability which would disturb weak gravity in a minkowski background could be an inhomogeneous fluctuation of @xmath15 , which could possibly generate violent breakdown of linearized einstein gravity .",
    "quite surprisingly , this is not the case and the seemingly most dangerous part , the kinetic term , is not as dangerous as it looks .",
    "essential to this conclusion is the constraint equation , which prevents @xmath15 from fluctuating freely and forces the denominator and the numerator to fluctuate in a strongly correlated way so that the contributions of the kinetic term to the equation of motion are regular and much smaller than those of the @xmath42 term .",
    "namely , the scalar field and metric can not fluctuate independently .",
    "in fact , it is a well - known fact in the standard scalar field cosmology that there is only one physical degree of freedom out of scalar field and metric degrees for scalar - type perturbations . in the longitudinal gauge ( see ( [ eqn : longitudinal - gauge ] ) or ( [ eqn : longitudinal - gauge - appendix ] ) ) , one of the constraint equations is the ( @xmath169)-component of the perturbed einstein equation , which is roughly of the form @xmath170 where @xmath61 is the momentum conjugate to the homogeneous background @xmath15 defined in ( [ eqn : eom - homogeneous - phi ] ) , @xmath171 is the inhomogeneous perturbation of @xmath15 , @xmath172 is the ( @xmath169)-component of the stress - energy tensor of fields and matter other than @xmath15 .",
    "note that homogeneous perturbations can be absorbed into the background and that , without loss of generality , we can restrict our analysis to inhomogeneous perturbations , for which @xmath173 .",
    "the right hand side of this equation is manifestly regular and we already know that @xmath61 behaves like ( [ eqn : asymptotic - pi ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath174 this means that @xmath171 is indeed suppressed at low energy ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "similarly , the other constraint equation , namely the traceless part of the ( @xmath175)-components of the perturbed einstein equation , leads to @xmath176 this again means that inhomogeneous perturbation of @xmath15 is suppressed at low energy .",
    "hence , from the constraint equations , we expect that the stress energy tensor of the scalar field should be small enough .",
    "more rigorous treatment of the constraint equations is included in the complete analysis shown in appendix  [ app : linear - gravity ] .",
    "since contributions of the singular - looking kinetic term are expected to be small enough , the only possibly important correction to einstein gravity is again due to the @xmath42 term .",
    "this tells us that the linearized gravity in our model should be similar to that in the theory @xmath82 .",
    "hence , we should be able to recover the linearized einstein gravity in minkowski background at distances longer than the length scale @xmath1 and at energies lower than @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis of the weak gravity in minkowski background requires much more carefulness .",
    "one of the reasons is that the action for the scalar field is not manifestly well defined in minkowski background since the denominator of the kinetic term vanishes at @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , it is not totally clear how to treat the perturbations of the denominator .",
    "this situation requires a sort of regularization for the field equation . in the end of the calculation",
    "we of course need to take the limit where the regularization is turned off . unlike calculations in quantum field theories",
    ", we must not renormalize anything since we are dealing with classical dynamics .",
    "namely , before turning off the regularization , we must not subtract anything from the regularized field equation and must treat it as it is .    for the purpose of the rigorous treatment of weak gravity ,",
    "we investigate in detail perturbations around the flat frw background in the longitudinal gauge and take the @xmath177 limit in the end of the calculation .",
    "this strategy makes it possible to analyze linear perturbations around minkowski background , on which the action of the scalar field perturbation is not apparently well - defined . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the frw background is driven by the scalar field @xmath15 .",
    "of course , we include a general matter stress - energy tensor into perturbations and carefully investigate how they couple to gravity .",
    "a critical point for this analysis is that constraint equations ( ( @xmath169)-components and the traceless part of ( @xmath175)-components of einstein equation ) prevent @xmath15 from fluctuating freely , and it turns out that the @xmath15 perturbation is of sufficiently high order in the @xmath86 expansion that the perturbative analysis is under control .",
    "the result of the analysis is simple .",
    "the linearized gravity in our model is similar to that in the theory @xmath82 in the sense that the only difference is the existence of an extra scalar - type massless mode in our model .",
    "the extra massless mode is decoupled from the matter stress - energy tensor at the linearized level .",
    "hence , as far as we are concerned with classical , linear perturbations generated by matter sources , these two theories give exactly the same prediction .",
    "therefore , in our model the linearized einstein gravity in minkowski background is recovered at distances longer than the length scale @xmath1 and at energies lower than @xmath2 .",
    "let us begin by defining the metric perturbation @xmath178 by @xmath179 where @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "we shall investigate the system of coupled equations for the scalar field perturbation @xmath171 , the metric perturbation @xmath178 and the stress energy tensor contributions from other fields and matter , taking into account all higher derivative corrections . in order to investigate linearized gravity in minkowski background , in the end of calculations",
    ", we shall take the limit @xmath182 keeping @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) finite , where @xmath185 .",
    "in the following , we shall denote @xmath186 by an overdot .    in order to take the full advantage of the symmetry of the background spacetime ( with @xmath187 ) , we expand the scalar field perturbation , the metric perturbation and the stress energy tensor contributions from other matter and fields by harmonics on the @xmath60-plane with each expansion coefficient being a function of the time @xmath188 only .",
    "now it is well - known and easily shown that there are three distinct types of perturbations and that each type is decoupled from the others in the linearized level .",
    "they are called scalar- , vector- and tensor - type perturbations and each of them is an irreducible representation of the symmetry of the background frw spacetime : spin-@xmath189 , spin-@xmath131 and spin-@xmath190 representations , respectively .",
    "since scalar- , vector- , and tensor - type perturbations are decoupled from each other in the linearized level , we can analyze perturbations of each type separately .",
    "the vector- and tensor - type perturbations are decoupled from scalar - type perturbations and , thus , from the perturbation of the scalar field @xmath15 .",

    "in other words , possible corrections to the linearized einstein equation appear only for the scalar - type perturbations .",

    "hence , the contributions of the kinetic term to the full quadratic action multiplied by @xmath227 are @xmath228 actually , all except for the first term vanish in the low energy limit since @xmath229 in the low energy limit @xmath230 and @xmath231 this means that @xmath232 asymptotically approaches a canonically normalized fluctuation in the low energy limit . in terms of @xmath232 ,",

    "this means that @xmath126 does not jump to a negative value by quantum fluctuation .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated gravity in the recently proposed dynamical approach to the cosmological constant .",
    "we have shown that ( i ) the effective cosmological constant decreases in time and asymptotically approaches zero from above ; ( ii ) the evolution of a homogeneous , isotropic universe is described by the standard friedmann equation at low energy ; that ( iii ) classical , linearized gravity in minkowski background is described by einstein gravity at distances longer than @xmath1 and at energies lower than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the planck length and @xmath4 is a dimensionless , positive parameter of the model ; that ( iv ) the mechanism is stable under radiative corrections and thus a zero or small cosmological constant is protected against radiative corrections ; and that ( v ) quantum fluctuation at low energy is so small that the effective cosmological constant at low energy does not overshoot zero even quantum mechanically .",
    "one of the most disturbing difficulties in thinking about the cosmological constant is that it is not protected against radiative corrections , which usually generate enormous vacuum energies compared to what we observe . because of the above properties ( i)-(v ) , the feedback mechanism can be considered as a dynamical way to protect a zero or small cosmological constant against radiative corrections . hence , although the feedback mechanism by itself does not solve the cosmological constant problem , it can help solving the problem .",
