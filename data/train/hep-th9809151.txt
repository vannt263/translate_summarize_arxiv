    "it is well known that there exists a connection between 2d induced gravity and @xmath0 wznw theory which has been established in the light - cone gauge @xcite and in the conformal gauge @xcite .",

    "the connection was established in a covariant way , using two independent approaches , lagrangian @xcite and hamiltonian @xcite .",

    "the reduction from wznw theory to liouville theory ( 2d induced gravity in the conformal gauge ) was used to obtain the solution of liouville equation of motion from the known solution of the wznw equation of motion . as was pointed out by the authors ,",
    "the advantage of this approach is that some configurations singular in liouville variables , with regular energy - momentum densities , become regular in wznw variables .",
    "we are going to generalize these results in the case of the curved space - time .    in sec.2 , for completeness of the paper , we introduce gauge invariant extension of the wznw system , following ref .",

    "we demonstrate how to make the transition from @xmath0 gauged wznw system to 2d induced gravity , but this time with the help of the classical equations of motion , instead of functional integral method in ref.@xcite . using the solution of the wznw system , we find the general solution of equations of motion for 2d induced gravity in sec.5 . in sec .",
