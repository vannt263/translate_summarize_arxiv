    "today s expanding demand for wireless services has necessitated cognitive radio technology in order to overcome the limitations of the conventional static spectrum allocation policy .",
    "cognitive radio technology enables a more efficient use of limited spectrum resources by allowing unlicensed users ( or secondary users ) to opportunistically utilize licensed spectral bands .",
    "the main challenges of cognitive radio include _ spectrum sensing _ at the physical ( phy ) layer to detect the activity of licensed users ( or primary users ) and _ spectrum sharing _ at the medium access control ( mac ) layer to coordinate access among coexisting secondary users @xcite .",
    "spectrum sensing is needed to identify spectrum opportunities or spectrum holes , while spectrum sharing helps secondary users achieve an efficient and fair use of identified spectrum opportunities .    in this paper",
    ", we study a mac protocol design problem for a cognitive radio network in which a primary user shares a spectral band ( or a channel ) with multiple secondary users .",
    "one of the main assumptions of our model is that the secondary users have limited spectrum sensing capability at the phy layer in the sense that they are unable to distinguish between the activities ( i.e. , spectrum access ) of the primary user and a secondary user . in other words , the secondary users can sense whether the channel is idle or busy , but when the channel is sensed busy , they do not know whether the channel is accessed by the primary user or not .",
    "this assumption contrasts with and is weaker than the prevailing assumption , made in previous work on mac design for cognitive radio , that sensing at the phy layer is perfect in that secondary users can always detect the presence of primary users ( see , for example , @xcite,@xcite ) . @xcite relaxes the assumption of perfect spectrum sensing and considers sensing errors at the phy layer",
    "however , @xcite requires that the signals of primary users be statistically distinguishable from those of secondary users . on the contrary",
    ", our assumption is valid when the signals of primary users are ( statistically ) indistinguishable from those of secondary users .",
    "another key assumption we maintain is that explicit coordination messages can not be communicated between a central controller and a user , or between users .",
    "this implies that the primary user can not broadcast its presence to the secondary users for spectrum sensing and that centralized scheduling schemes such as tdma can not be used for spectrum sharing .",
    "again , this assumption contrasts with and is weaker than the assumption made in existing work that requires central controllers or dedicated control channels ( see , for example , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , in cognitive radio networks , protocols requiring broadcast messages cause a major problem due to the lack of a reliable control channel as a channel has to be vacated whenever a primary user returns to the channel .    our protocol design for the secondary users is based on mac protocols with memory , which are formally presented in @xcite . under a protocol with memory , users adjust their transmission parameters depending on the local histories of their own transmission actions and feedback information .",
    "hence , protocols with memory can be implemented in a distributed way without explicit message passing for any given sensing ability of users . moreover , by exploiting information embedded in local histories , protocols with memory enable a secondary user to `` change its transmitter parameters based on interaction with the environment in which it operates , '' as demanded by the definition of cognitive radio @xcite .    in @xcite , we have focused on the problem of achieving coordinated access among symmetric users by using a protocol with memory . in a cognitive radio network , where a primary user exists , another kind of coordination is needed to ensure that the secondary users do not interfere with the primary user . in this paper , we show that a class of protocols with one - slot memory can achieve high channel utilization by the secondary users while protecting the primary user at a desired level .",
    "we also show that the system performance can be improved by utilizing longer memory .",
    "the results of this paper suggest that a carefully designed mac protocol can be used in place of an algorithm for primary user detection at the phy layer . the main contribution of this paper is to illustrate the possibility of utilizing mac design to overcome limitations in spectrum sensing at the phy layer as well as to achieve spectrum sharing at the mac layer .    in recent years",
    ", there have been burgeoning research efforts involving cognitive radio networks . due to space limitations",
    ", we review only a few of them , focusing on the most related work , and refer the interested reader to @xcite for a comprehensive survey .",
    "@xcite examines gains from spectrum agility in terms of spectrum utilization .",
    "our model corresponds to the non - agile case of @xcite as secondary users in our model stay in the same channel for the considered horizon of time .",
    "this is because our model is not equipped with ideal control devices as assumed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite uses a mechanism design approach to determine the allocation of spectrum opportunities to selfish secondary users .",
    "@xcite analyzes the decision of secondary users to sense and access channels using a partially observable markov decision process framework .",
    "@xcite evaluates performance under two spectrum access schemes using different sensing , back - off , and transmission mechanisms .",
    "@xcite develops a sensing - period optimization mechanism and an optimal channel - sequencing algorithm for efficient discovery of spectrum opportunities .",
    "@xcite models the interactions between secondary users as a non - cooperative game and derives the price of anarchy . a survey on mac protocols for cognitive radio networks is presented in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe our system model . in section iii ,",
    "we formulate mac protocols , performance metrics , and a protocol design problem . in section iv , we explain how to compute the performance metrics for a given protocol , using markov chains . in section",
    "v , we solve the protocol design problem numerically . in section",
    "vi , we discuss how the proposed protocols can be enhanced by utilizing longer memory . in section vii",
    ", we conclude this paper .",
    "we consider a licensed channel in a slotted aloha - type network , as in @xcite and @xcite , with a single primary user and @xmath0 secondary users .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is fixed over time .",
    "time is divided into slots of equal length , and the primary and secondary users maintain synchronized time slots .",
    "a user can attempt to transmit a packet or wait in a slot in which it has a packet to transmit .",
    "due to interference , only one user can transmit successfully in a slot , and simultaneous transmission by more than one user results in a collision .",
    "the traffic of the primary user arrives following a stochastic process .",
    "we assume that an arrival of traffic generates multiple packets , the average number of which is denoted by @xmath1 , and that the average time interval ( measured in slots ) between two consecutive arrivals of traffic , denoted by @xmath2 , is larger than @xmath1 . in each slot , the primary user has either a packet to transmit or none depending on traffic arrivals and transmission results .",
    "the state of the primary user , denoted by @xmath3 , is said to be _ on _ if the primary user has a packet to transmit and _ off _ otherwise . a similar _ on_-_off _ model for the primary user can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each secondary user always has packets to transmit .",
    "after a user makes a transmission attempt , it learns whether the transmission is successful or not using an acknowledgement ( ack ) response .",
    "the secondary users have the sensing ability to find out whether the channel is accessed or not while they wait .",
    "however , when the channel is sensed busy , they do not obtain information about whether the primary user accessed the channel or not .",
    "this assumption limits the ability of the secondary users to detect the presence of the primary user .",
    "using the information from ack responses and sensing , a secondary user can classify a slot into the four states , _ idle _ , _ busy _ , _ success _ , and _ failure _ , as in @xcite .",
    "the state of secondary user @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath5 , is _ idle _ if no user transmits , _ busy _ if secondary user @xmath4 does not transmit but at least one other user transmits , _ success _ if secondary user @xmath4 transmits and succeeds , and _ failure _ if secondary user @xmath4 transmits but fails .",
    "the decision rule for the primary user is to transmit whenever it has a packet to transmit .",
    "note that the primary user does not need to modify its decision rule for coexistence with the secondary users , which is consistent with the requirements of cognitive radio networks .",
    "the decision rule for the secondary users is prescribed by a protocol with one - slot memory @xcite .",
    "a protocol with one - slot memory specifies a transmission probability for each possible state of the previous slot , and thus it can be formally represented by a function @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 is the set of the states of a secondary user , i.e. , @xmath8 . a secondary user",
    "whose state is @xmath9 in the previous slot transmits with probability @xmath10 in the current slot .",
    "we provide two definitions about the properties of a protocol with one - slot memory .",
    "a protocol @xmath11 with one - slot memory is _ non - intrusive _ if @xmath12 .",
    "when the secondary users follow a non - intrusive protocol , they wait in a slot following a busy slot .",
    "thus , a non - intrusive protocol allows the primary user not to be interrupted by the secondary users once it has a successful transmission .",
    "a protocol @xmath11 with one - slot memory has the _ fairness level _ @xmath13 $ ]",
    "if the average number of consecutive successes by a secondary user while the primary user does not transmit is @xmath14 , or @xmath15    suppose that there is no transmission by the primary user .",
    "once a secondary user succeeds , it has a successful transmission in the next slot with probability @xmath16 , and thus the average number of consecutive successes is given by @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "as the fairness level is smaller , a secondary user keeps using the channel for a longer period once it succeeds , which makes other secondary users wait longer until they have a successful transmission . in @xcite , a protocol with fairness level @xmath18",
    "is said to be @xmath19-short - term fair if @xmath20 .        in overlay spectrum sharing ,",
    "it is important to protect the primary user from interruption by the secondary users .",
    "we measure interference experienced by the primary user by the collision probability of the primary user , defined as @xmath21 where pu represents `` primary user . ''",
    "that is , the collision probability of the primary user is the probability that it experiences a collision when it attempts to transmit a packet .",
    "we measure the utilization of spectrum opportunities by the success probability of the secondary users , defined as @xmath22 where su represents `` secondary user . ''",
    "in other words , the success probability of the secondary users is the probability that a secondary user has a successful transmission when the primary user has no packet to transmit .",
    "the channel utilization ( or throughput ) of the secondary users is defined as the proportion of time slots in which a secondary user has a successful transmission , i.e. , @xmath23      the channel utilization of the system is defined as the proportion of time slots in which a successful transmission occurs , i.e. , @xmath24      we define an _ on _ period and an _ off _ period as a period in which the state of the primary user is _ on _ and _ off _ , respectively , between two consecutive arrivals of traffic .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be the average length ( measured in slots ) of an _ on _ period and an _ off _ period , respectively .",
    "then the average time interval between two consecutive arrivals of traffic can be decomposed as @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the average number of collisions that the primary user experiences while transmitting packets generated by an arrival of traffic .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 to assure the stability of the system .",
    "since the primary user transmits whenever it has a packet to transmit , it has either a successful transmission or a collision when its state is _",
    "on_. hence , an _ on _ period can be decomposed into slots in which the primary user succeeds and those in which it collides , i.e. , @xmath30 . let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be the average numbers of slots in which one and none , respectively , of the secondary users has a successful transmission between two consecutive arrivals of traffic . given the protocol for the primary user and our contention model , a secondary user can have a successful transmission only when the state of the primary user is _",
    "off_. thus , we can decompose an _ off _",
    "period into slots in which a secondary user succeeds and those in which no secondary user succeeds , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are determined by the protocol and the traffic arrival process whereas @xmath1 and @xmath2 are determined entirely by the traffic arrival process .",
    "we explain how we ( approximately ) compute the performance metrics defined in this section .",
    "the collision probability of the primary user can be computed as @xmath34 since the primary user transmits whenever its state is _",
    "on_. also , the success probability of the secondary users can be computed as @xmath35 .",
    "the channel utilization of the primary user is given by @xmath36 , while that of the secondary users is @xmath37 .",
    "the channel utilization of the system can be computed as @xmath38 .    when perfect control devices are available to broadcast the presence of the primary user and to schedule access by the secondary users as in @xcite , we can obtain @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus , with control devices , we can achieve the maximum values of the performance metrics @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "note that the channel utilization of the primary user is not affected by the absence of control devices ( as long as @xmath29 ) although the primary user may experience increased delay as @xmath28 becomes large due to contention between the primary user and the secondary users .",
    "the value of @xmath44 becomes smaller as contention among the secondary users increases .",
    "the ratio of @xmath45 to @xmath46 can be used as a measure of inefficiency due to the absence of control devices .",
    "we formulate a problem solved by the protocol designer to determine a protocol .",
    "we assume that the protocol designer considers only non - intrusive protocols with one - slot memory .",
    "non - intrusiveness is a desirable property in that it prevents the secondary users from interrupting the primary user once the primary user obtains a successful transmission .",
    "we focus on protocols with one - slot memory because they are simple to design and implement .",
    "we also assume that the protocol designer has the most preferred fairness level @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "then non - intrusiveness together with fairness level @xmath18 implies that @xmath47 by , and the remaining elements of a protocol to be specified are transmission probabilities following an idle state and a failure state , denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . for simplicity , we call hereafter a non - intrusive protocol with one - slot memory having fairness level @xmath18 a @xmath18-fair non - intrusive protocol .",
    "the protocol designer aims to maximize the channel utilization of the system while keeping the collision probability of the primary user below a certain threshold level specified as @xmath50 .",
    "the protection level @xmath51 can be considered as a requirement imposed by the primary user or by spectrum regulators .",
    "the protocol design problem can be formally expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the set of all @xmath18-fair non - intrusive protocols .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent of the prescribed protocol , the protocol design problem can be rewritten as @xmath54 ^ 2 } c_s = p_s \\frac{t_{int } - t_{pac } - t_{col}}{t_{int } } \\textrm { subject to } t_{col } \\leq \\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the threshold level for @xmath28 , derived from the relationship @xmath56 and the requirement @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath28 appears both in the objective function and in the constraint .",
    "the protocol designer prefers small @xmath28 for two reasons .",
    "smaller @xmath28 implies less interference to the primary user and at the same time longer _ off _ periods that the secondary users can utilize . in section",
    "iv we explain how to compute @xmath58 and @xmath28 analytically given a @xmath18-fair non - intrusive protocol , while in section v we investigate the solution to the protocol design problem using numerical illustrations .",

    "the secondary users contend with each other until a secondary user obtains a success , i.e. , state 1 is reached .",
    "when a secondary user obtains a success , it transmits with probability @xmath73 in the next slot while all the other secondary users wait",

    ", the protocol designer can choose an estimation procedure that is biased toward overestimation , or specify a smaller @xmath142 than the required threshold .",
    "we have adopted protocols with one - slot memory for their simplicity .",
    "protocols with one - slot memory not only are easy to design and implement but also allow us to use markov chains to study performance . however , as illustrated in @xcite , it is possible to obtain performance improvement by utilizing longer memory . in this section ,",
    "we explain how longer memory can help reduce the average number of collisions and bound the maximum number of collisions experienced by the primary user in an _ on _ period .",
    "let @xmath212 be the transmission probability of secondary user @xmath4 in slot @xmath69 .",
    "a protocol with @xmath213-slot memory that enhances a @xmath18-fair non - intrusive protocol @xmath11 can be expressed as follows :    ( p1 ) : :    if @xmath214 and    @xmath215 , then @xmath216 .",
    "( p2 ) : :    if @xmath217 , then    @xmath216 .",

    "note that a collision following a success can not occur in an _ off _ period by non - intrusiveness , and thus ( p1 ) does not affect performance in an _ off _ period .",
    "the only possible occasion in which a collision follows a success is when the primary user starts transmitting .",
    "therefore , if a secondary user experiences a collision following a success , it can infer than an _ on _ period has started . according to a @xmath18-fair non - intrusive protocol",
    ", a secondary user transmits with probability @xmath139 after a collision , which yields @xmath219_1 $ ] in . by imposing ( p1 ) , we can reduce the value to @xmath220 , which in turn reduces the value of @xmath28 .",
    "for example , with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath221 , ( p1 ) reduces @xmath222 from @xmath223 to @xmath224 and @xmath28 from @xmath225 to @xmath226 .      in the range of parameter values considered in section v , the average number of collisions experienced by the primary user in an _ on _ period is reasonably small , not exceeding 1.5 slots , even without a constraint imposed on it .",
    "however , as colliding secondary users transmit with probability @xmath227 , the realized number of collisions in an _ on _ period can be arbitrarily large with positive probability .",
    "that is , the worst - case number of collisions in an _ on _ period is unbounded under a @xmath18-fair non - intrusive protocol .",
    "we can bound the maximum number of collisions in an _ on _ period by imposing ( p2 ) , which requires a secondary user that experiences @xmath213 consecutive collisions to back off .",
    "since non - colliding secondary users wait after a collision , colliding secondary users must have the same number of consecutive collisions in any slot .",
    "thus , secondary users experiencing @xmath213 consecutive collisions back off simultaneously , yielding a slot that can be utilized by the primary user .",
    "therefore , the primary user can not experience more than @xmath213 collisions in an _ on _ period . when @xmath213 is chosen moderately large",
    ", @xmath213 consecutive collisions rarely occur in an _ off _ period , and thus ( p2 ) has a negligible impact on the success probability of the secondary users @xmath58 while it reduces @xmath28 .",
    "( p2 ) can be considered as a safety device to limit the number of collisions that the primary user can experience during an _ on _ period .",
    "in this paper , we have considered a scenario in which a primary user shares a channel with secondary users that can not distinguish the signals of the primary user from those of a secondary user .",
    "we have shown that a class of distributed mac protocols can coordinate access among the secondary users while restricting interference to the primary user , thereby overcoming the limited sensing ability of the secondary users at the phy layer .",
    "the basic ideas underlying the proposed protocols can be exploited in different settings .",
    "for example , in a random access network with csma / ca , protocols with memory can be used to adjust the back - off parameters of secondary users based on their own transmission results and obtained channel information .",
    "also , we can provide quality - of - service differentiation to secondary users by specifying different protocol parameters across secondary users .",
    "the fairness level for a secondary user determines the average number of its consecutive successes , while the transmission probabilities following an idle or a collision slot determine the probability that a secondary user is chosen as the successful user for the next success period in a contention period .",
    "finally , the enhanced protocols with longer memory suggest the potential of observed patterns in history as a substitute for explicit information passing .",
    "as users make decisions based on history under a protocol with memory , users can adjust their behavior to the network environment or the states of other users by extracting information from history .",
