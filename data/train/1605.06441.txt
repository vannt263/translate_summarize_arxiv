    "this comes from the fact that the phenomena at each block of eigenvalues having equal projections on the critical ray @xmath148 are independent .",

    "the two passages commute and the final result is independent of the sign of @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , the construction of the stokes matrices shows that they depend analytically on the eigenvalues .",

    "hypothesis implies that @xmath165 on @xmath101 and everywhere on @xmath166 . as a matter of fact , this ordering is precisely why we take as a hypothesis .",
    "this order is respected on every thin intersection @xmath167 and is completely reversed on @xmath168 .",
    "a direct consequence is that the stokes matrices are alternatively upper and lower triangular .",
    "+   + this whole construction depends on the choice of @xmath101 as our starting ray , but this choice is not canonical .",
    "let @xmath119 be the first separating ray by order of increasing argument .",
    "let us suppose that on the associated critical ray @xmath163 precisely the following signed projections are equal @xmath170 and the others are distinct . if @xmath171 , then @xmath172 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath173 , the new order of the eigenvalues on @xmath45 is obtained by completely reversing the order of the eigenvalues at positions @xmath174 to @xmath175 and leaving the others as they were .",
    "the signed projections on @xmath176 depend continuously on @xmath47 , implying that if @xmath171 , then @xmath172 .",
    "let us call @xmath177 .",
    "then @xmath178 since the @xmath179 are distinct , and because is satisfied , it follows that the @xmath180 are distinct . since @xmath181 for @xmath182 , then @xmath183 , from which the conclusion follows .",
    "let us suppose that on @xmath127 , @xmath147 subsets of consecutive eigenvalues have equal order .",
    "then for @xmath184 , the new order of the eigenvalues on @xmath185 is obtained from the order in by completely reversing the order in each group .",
    "let us now describe the stokes matrices of the system using the starting ray @xmath190 , i.e. the sectors @xmath118 , which we will denote by @xmath117 .",
    "for that purpose we need to find , for each @xmath34 , a new fundamental matrix solution @xmath191 on @xmath118 , which exhibits the correct order of flatness on @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "then we will have @xmath194    we claim that such a new fundamental matrix solution can be taken as @xmath195 without loss of generality we can suppose that @xmath196 , the other cases being similar . in this case , we need only prove that @xmath197 is a fundamental matrix solution , the columns of which satisfy @xmath198 the proof uses the following facts :    * we know that such a fundamental matrix solution exists .",
    "this comes from the sectorial normalization theorem ( @xcite ) for the system after a change @xmath199 .",
    "* moreover , we know that a matrix @xmath191 , the columns of which satisfy , is unique up to right multiplication by a diagonal matrix .    hence , as soon as we show that the choice is the only possible choice ( up to right multiplication by a diagonal matrix ) that could meet the constraints , then we are sure that it indeed does satisfy the constraints .",

    "_ after _ ) the separating ray @xmath200 if we are in a region @xmath201 ( resp .",
    "@xmath202 ) . also , note that each sector @xmath17 or @xmath118 contains exactly one separating ray for each pair of eigenvalues .",
    "for instance , since @xmath127 is the separating ray inside @xmath42 and @xmath203 for any pair of eigenvalues within @xmath204 , then @xmath205 is a separating ray for the same pair of eigenvalues inside @xmath17 , and also inside the new sector @xmath206 .",
    "( this is a particular case of the general fact that if @xmath207 is some separating ray for some subset of eigenvalues inside a sector @xmath208 , then @xmath209 is a separating ray for the same subset of eigenvalues inside @xmath210 . )",
    "it is straightforward that the solutions @xmath211 for @xmath212 , are adequate because @xmath127 is a separating ray only for pairs of eigenvalues among @xmath213 .",
    "hence , @xmath214 on @xmath215 since it is the case on @xmath216 .",
    "also , in @xmath217 , we have @xmath218 since we passed one separating ray for each pair of eigenvalues among @xmath219 .",
    "moreover , from it is clear that on @xmath215 , for @xmath221 , @xmath222 this comes from the fact that @xmath223 , from , and from the fact that we have only crossed the separating ray @xmath127 .",
    "we have the asymptotic order reverse to on @xmath217 .",
    "indeed , @xmath224 is located after the separating ray @xmath225 ( the second separating ray for the pairs of eigenvalues in the block ) , and before the second separating rays for the other pairs of eigenvalues .",
    "it remains to compare the solutions @xmath226 for @xmath227 .",
    "if @xmath228 , then the linear combination @xmath229 provides exactly vectors that have the same order of flatness with respect to @xmath230 for @xmath231 .",
    "we claim that they are ordered as : @xmath232 hence , reordering the vectors by letting @xmath233 for @xmath234 , which corresponds to applying the permutation matrix @xmath235 to the part of the fundamental matrix solution corresponding to @xmath236 ( i.e. @xmath237 to the full @xmath238 fundamental matrix solution ) , yields the theorem .",
    "let us now prove the claim .",
    "the first part on @xmath215 follows from and the fact that we are after @xmath127 . to derive the second conclusion ,",
