    "molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath2 ) is the most abundant molecule in the universe .",
    "its excitation and emission has been thoroughly studied theoretically and the emission line ratios have been modelled in detail ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "transitions from the rotational and vibrational levels of the ground electronic state of the h@xmath2 molecule produce emission lines in the spectral range from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the far - infrared ( far - ir ) . the most relevant excitation mechanisms of h@xmath2 are :    fluorescence or radiative pumping through the absorption of uv radiation from a hot source , and    collisional excitation .",
    "photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , where a hot source of uv photons irradiates neutral clouds of material , are typical sites for uv excitation of h@xmath2 .",
    "this includes star - forming regions , but it also applies to any cloud illuminated by a local interstellar radiation field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and particularly the photodissociation front around a planetary nebula ( pn ) central star ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , shocks propagating into a medium can heat the gas and collisionally excite the h@xmath2 molecules ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also the case for the outflowing gas in pne , which can produce the collisional excitation of h@xmath2 in shock regions even if they are embedded in the ionized regions of pne with high temperature central stars @xcite .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are classical targets for the study of molecular hydrogen , very particularly through its infrared line emission .",
    "near - infrared ( near - ir ) narrowband imaging surveys of pne have detected the presence of h@xmath2 in many objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the h@xmath2 emission is detected in the envelopes and pdrs of pne , where the molecule can be shielded from the uv radiation of the central star by the inner gas and dust or by high - density clumps @xcite . using the known general behaviour and properties of h@xmath2 in the interstellar medium ( ism ; @xcite ) ,",
    "several studies have attempted to gain insight into the conditions in pne where this species is found .",
    "the correlation between the bipolar morphology of pne and the h@xmath2 detection is well documented @xcite , suggesting that the h@xmath2-bright waists of bipolar pne are the remnants of dense , molecule - rich circumstellar disks .",
    "alternatively , it has been claimed that the preferential detection of h@xmath2 emission in bipolar pne may be an effect of the typically higher effective temperature of their central stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the consensus is that the brightest h@xmath2 emitters tend to be bipolar pne , but deep near - ir imaging of the 2.122 @xmath0 m h@xmath2 emission line shows that this emission is not exclusive to this morphology @xcite .    besides the excellent near - ir spectroscopic survey of pne and study of upper vibrational levels carried out by @xcite , the actual investigation of the excitation mechanism of h@xmath2 in pne and the calculations of its excitation temperature",
    "have been made in the context of other detailed studies ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the study of the thermal and molecular emission from pne , since such observations are much less affected by dust extinction .",
    "mid - ir studies of pne have focused on imaging surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but mid - ir spectroscopy of pne has only been carried out for individual objects for which chemical abundances and h@xmath2 excitation temperatures were obtained @xcite .",
    "currently , mid - ir studies of the excitation temperature of h@xmath2 in pne are scarce .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]      the h@xmath2 rotational excitation temperatures derived in this work are all in the range of 900 k. among the nebulae in our sample , ngc2346 , ngc2440 , and ngc6720 were included in the near - ir spectroscopic study of upper vibrational levels of the h@xmath2 molecule carried out by @xcite . in that paper",
    ", ngc2346 is considered to be uv - excited and an h@xmath1 rotational excitation temperature of 1260@xmath5200 k is reported .",
    "this value is larger that the one reported here , 950@xmath5110 k , but within the uncertainties .",
    "the temperatures derived for different regions of ngc2440 and ngc6720 range from 1070@xmath5200 k to 2020@xmath5200 k for the former and from 1240@xmath5100 k to 2000@xmath5200 k for the latter .",
    "@xcite suggests that all these regions ( see table  4 ) are uv excited , except probably the halo of ngc6720 .",
    "the temperature in the north lobe of ngc2440 and ring of ngc6720 would be consistent with our results , but not those in the hottest regions .",
    "other pne with reported h@xmath2 excitation temperatures are ngc6445 and ngc6537 ( 1520 k and 3600 k , respectively , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ngc7293 ( 900 k , * ? ? ?",
    "the most discrepant temperature is that of ngc6537 , but we note that @xcite derived a value for the innermost nebular regions of this extremely high excitation pn , whereas the mid - ir spectrum presented here traces the outer bipolar lobes .",
    "ngc6781 has been reported to exhibit strong [ ar  iii ] , [ s  iv ] , and [ ne  ii ] emission in the internal nebular shell that drops off suddenly outside its borders @xcite .",
    "our study confirmed the line intensity ratios of these ionic lines , whereas the h@xmath2 excitation temperature provided by @xcite are in good agreement with the value of 880 k derived in this work .",
    "we present an investigation of archival _ spitzer _ irs spectra of a sample of pne to search for mid - ir h@xmath2 lines . among the original sample of 14 pne with useful _ spitzer _",
    "irs sl observations known to exhibit h@xmath2 emission lines in the near - ir , 11 pne show detectable mid - ir h@xmath2 lines .",
    "this result increases the number of known pne with mid - ir h@xmath2 emission lines from three ( ngc6302 , ngc6781 , and ngc7293 ) to twelve .",
    "the spectral analysis detects all the h@xmath2 0 - 0 transitions from the s(2 ) to the s(7 ) lines . among these lines ,",
    "the h@xmath2 0 - 0 s(3 ) @xmath69.66 @xmath0 m line is the brightest .",
    "the analysis of the population distribution in the h@xmath2 molecules of these pne reveals a t@xmath3(rot ) excitation temperature of 900 k for all of them .",
    "the conspicuous uniformity of the excitation temperature is intriguing , because the observations trace different morphological features of a non - uniform sample of pne with different morphologies and evolutionary stages .",
    "near - ir studies are needed to confirm these excitation temperatures and to diagnose the excitation mechanism of h@xmath2 in these pne .",
    "ionic lines of [ ar  iii ] , [ s  iv ] , [ ne  ii ] , and [ ne  v ] are also detected .",
    "their line intensities show the expected positive correlation of the [ ne  v]/[ne  ii ] line ratio with the cspn effective temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the anti - correlation between the [ ar  iii]/[ne  ii ] and cspn effective temperature is not expected and may imply changes in the elemental ratios that suggest that pne with hottest cspn , probably descending from more massive progenitors , are able to produce neon .",
    "alternatively , the more massive progenitors produce regions of higher density that reduce the [ ne  v]/[ne  ii ] line ratio .",
