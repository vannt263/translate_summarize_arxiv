    "over the past few years the subject of `` soft physics '' has reemerged from the shadows , and has aroused the interest of the phenomenological community . this in no small way , due to the realization that the calculation of the probability of detecting a diffractive hard pqcd process e.g. higgs production at the lhc , also depends on the underlying secondaries which are produced by `` soft '' rescattering .",
    "central diffractive production e.g. ( higgs boson , 2 jets , 2 @xmath0 s , @xmath1 ) , are accompanied by gaps in rapidity , between the two outgoing projectiles , and the centrally produced particles , which makes their detection easier .",
    "the subject of the survival of these rapidity gaps was initiated over twenty years ago @xcite , and has been refined over the interim period @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the details on which our two channel ( glm ) model is based i.e. the good - walker ( g - w ) mechanism @xcite can be found in @xcite .",
    "see also u. maor s talk in these proceeedings . it is well known that g - w neglects the diffractive production of large mass states ( mueller diagrams @xcite ) , and to successfully describe the diffractive data , these need to be included by adding the relevant triple pomeron contributions ( see l.h .",
    "diagrams in fig.1 ) .",
    "in addition it is also necessary to include diagrams containing pomeron loops , as shown in the r.h .",
    "diagrams in fig.1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     at an energy of 7 tev we predict a value @xmath2 @xmath3 0.6% . we have also succeeded in summing the semi - enhanced contribution ( see r.h .",
    "side of fig.1 ) to the survival probability , and find that it is almost energy independent , and has a value @xmath3 100% at tevatron and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "we present a model for soft interactions having two components : ( i ) g - w mechanism for elastic and low mass diffractive scattering , and ( ii ) pomeron enhanced contributions for high mass diffractive production .",
    "in addition we find from our fit that the slope of the pomeron @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with what one expects in pqcd , since for a bfkl pomeron @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "having @xmath7 , provides a necessary condition that links strong ( soft ) interactions with the hard interactions described by pqcd .",
    "a key hypothesis in our model is that the soft processes are not `` soft '' , but originate from short distances .",
    "we have only one pomeron .",
    "there is no requirement for a `` soft '' and `` hard '' pomeron .",
    "this is in accord with hera data for @xmath8 , which is smooth throughout the transition region @xcite .    to illustrate our achievements and problems , we compare our approach with the work of the durham group @xcite@xcite .",
    "the main difference in the underlying philosophy of the two groups is that , the durham approach is based on the parton model where there is only a short range rapidity interaction between partons , while we , due to exchange of gluons in qcd , have a long range rapidity interaction .",
    "both approaches consider @xmath9 as being small . in both programs",
    "the pomeron interaction was taken into account .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is that kmr made an _ ad hoc _ `` reasonable '' assumption , that the multi - pomeron vertices have the following form , for the transition of @xmath10 pomerons to @xmath11 pomerons [ dg1 ] g^n_m = nm^n + m -2g_n/2 = nm^n+m-3g_3/2 .",
    "no theoretical arguments or theoretical models were offered in support of this assumption , which certainly contradicts the pqcd approach @xcite . in spite of these differences ,",
    "the values obtained for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in surprisingly close agreement ( see table 2 ) .",
    "it is only in the latest version of the durham model @xcite , which includes three components of the pomeron , with different transverse momenta of the partons in each component ( to mimic bfkl diffusion in @xmath14 ) , that there are fairly large discrepancies in the diffractive sector i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "kmr @xcite find that at higher energies @xmath15 and @xmath13 have comparable values and similar energy dependence , this is not so in our description @xcite ( see fig.2 ) . we note that the results presented by poghosyan at this conference for @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite agree both in magnitude and energy dependence with those obtained in the glmm model .",
    "there is also disgreement in the result for the calculation of the survival probability . in @xcite ,",
    "the survival probability is now multiplied by a `` renormalizing '' factor @xmath17 and referred to as @xmath18 .",
    "the result for lhc energy is @xmath19 = @xmath20 .",
    "it is not clear whether there is in addition a factor of @xmath21 @xmath22 , that needs to be incorporated .",
    "if affirmative , then the discrepancy between our result and that of the durham group for @xmath23 at tevatron energies is small , but the discrepancy becomes larger for the lhc energy range , as we predict that @xmath24 decreases as the rapidity between the projectiles increases , while durham claim little ( if any ) energy dependence for @xmath21 .",
    "this research was supported in part by bsf grant @xmath25 20004019 and by a grant from israel ministry of science and the foundation for basic research of the russian federation .",
