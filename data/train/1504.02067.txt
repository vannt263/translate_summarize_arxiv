    "@xcite , we are currently unable to change how populated the star is ( i.e. how much the chemical potential is greater than the fermion mass ) and so can not fully explore the entanglement entropy of these solutions .    our results strongly indicate that the entanglement entropy of the mesonic phase of the magnetic electron star is undergoing a `` phase transition '' as it transitions to the in  falling solution .",

    "@xcite , in the case of holographic superconductors .",
    "however , without being able to compare to the disk case we can not say how robust this `` phase transition '' may be , and in addition , without a careful study of the stability of magnetic electron stars we can not rule out the possibility that we are detecting an instability .",

    "we have computed the finite part of the holographic entanglement entropy for the strip and disk geometry for purely electric , purely magnetic , and dyonic dilatonic black holes , as well as the strip entanglement entropy for the magnetic electron star solutions of ref .",
    "we observed how the entanglement entropy for the ped solution backgrounds at large @xmath44 approach the in  falling solution , which contributes a non  zero value to the entanglement entropy .",
    "we also found that different uv regulators , due to having different coordinate systems , can introduce a shift in the entanglement entropy .",
    "similar results are obtained for the pmd backgrounds , and we are able to show that the entanglement entropy is invariant under electromagnetic duality , as long as one shifts the relative location of the physical horizons between the ped and pmd solutions .    for the dilaton ",
    "dyon black hole , we found that the entanglement entropy for the disk , at large @xmath44 , grows linearly with @xmath44 , with a coefficient approximately equal to the ground state degeneracy of our solutions .",
    "this suggests a volume law rather than an area law for these backgrounds .",
    "lastly , for the mesonic phase of the magnetic electron star solution , we found that the entanglement entropy smoothly passes into the star , but that at a certain value of @xmath44 , it is actually the in  falling solution that has lower entropy than the hanging surface .",
    "this suggests that at a value of @xmath6 , with @xmath227 , the minimal surface breaks to the in ",

    "this strongly suggests the presence of a `` phase transition , '' however , pending further investigation we can not say for certain ; regardless , our results indicate at least some non  trivial behavior in the far ir for the entanglement entropy . in all cases ,",
    "we find a dependence of the large @xmath44 behavior of the entanglement entropy on the various dimensionless ratios in the theory .",
    "there are several directions for future work .",
    "we mentioned in section [ mes ] that one could study the disk entanglement entropy for the mesonic case , as well as the entanglement entropy of the partially fractionalized phases of the magnetic electron stars . for the case of zero magnetic field but with a charged star and electrically charged horizon  a partially fractionalized phase ",
    "the entanglement entropy s dependence on the charge was studied in refs . @xcite and there",
    "it was found that there was a logarithmic violation to the area law due to the charged horizon but not the star .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the presence of the magnetic field in such phases changes this behavior .",
    "since we have only studied the mesonic phase in this paper , we do not expect the logarithmic violation , at least in the electric sector . perhaps , however , even in the mesonic phase the presence of the horizon for the magnetic sector will modify the area law behavior of the entanglement entropy in an interesting way .",
    "additionally , one could construct and study finite temperature versions of our solutions .",
