    "nanoscale mechanical resonators have proven to be useful tools for chemical detection  @xcite thanks to their incredibly high sensitivity to added mass  @xcite and the ease with which their vibrational frequencies can be measured to great accuracy . for a device of tens or hundreds of picograms , molecules adsorbed onto the surface at the scale of femtograms or smaller are detectable as shifts in the resonance frequencies  @xcite . a serious limitation , however , is that the linear relationship between the amount of mass added and the change in the observed resonances involves a sometimes difficult - to - determine constant of proportionality .",
    "this fact , which goes unacknowledged in much of the literature , is a major impediment to high - accuracy nanomechanical mass sensing .    for a perfectly uniform distribution of added mass , the constant of proportionality is straightforward to compute",
    ": it is a simple geometric factor , given by the ratio of the resonator s mode - specific `` effective mass '' to its true inertial mass  @xcite .",
    "even if the deposition is nonuniform , the situation is still manageable so long as the mass distribution is well characterized ( and not too concentrated near the nodes of the detection mode ) .",
    "more typical of a sensing application , though , is that the distribution is of arbitrary form and more or less unknown . in that case",
    ", there is no reliable way to extract the total adsorbed mass from frequency - shift measurements  @xcite , except at the level of an order - of - magnitude estimate .    to avoid this problem ,",
    "efforts have been made to concentrate mass adsorption to specific sites on a device through complex fabrication  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach has been to employ multimode measurements  @xcite , which can provide some degree of spatial resolution ( limited by the propagation of experimental uncertainties through the `` inversion kernel ''  @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest example is that both the size and location of a _ point mass_situated along a resonator with extent primarily in one dimension  can be determined from a simultaneous measurement of two resonance frequency shifts  @xcite . in a slightly different context ,",
    "multimode measurements have been shown to provide single - resonator discrimination for the mass added along an array of strongly coupled devices  @xcite .",
    "the work reported in this paper also takes advantage of a multimode framework ( described in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework_for_analysis ] ) , and we find that silicon nitride nanostrings  @xcite are an excellent platform for our technique . indeed , although the original experiment by dohn and collaborators to determine the mass and location of a pointlike object was performed on cantilevers  @xcite , it was soon recognized that the sinusoidal mode shapes characteristic of nanomechanical strings greatly simplify the analysis  @xcite . as an added benefit , for materials such as stoichiometric silicon nitride , the high internal tension that draws a doubly clamped beam taut enough to become stringlike leads to correspondingly high mechanical quality factors .",
    "these high values aid in detection  @xcite and are maintained even in the presence of a metallic overlayer added to the device for the purpose of functionalization  @xcite .",
    "optical microscope image showing a 101.7 m  nanostring with a large number of rdx crystallites physisorbed onto the device surface.,width=278 ]    in a previous study on nanostrings , real - time mass sensing was mimicked by carrying out sequential frequency - shift measurements of the first two harmonics in conjunction with pick - and - place deposition of a single microparticle  @xcite . in our work ,",
    "genuine real - time observations are made : we measure the first , third , and fifth harmonics simultaneously as a function of time while mass sublimates from the device surface .",
    "this is possible because we are able to resolve all three of these modes using optical interferometry at the midpoint of the string with the device entirely under thermomechanical actuation .",
    "we show that measurements of any pair of modes reveal not only the instantaneous total mass of molecules adsorbed but also their distribution  at least in the regime where the distribution is smooth , slowly varying , and roughly symmetric about the resonator midpoint .",
    "we provide explicit formulas ( derived in sec .  [",
    "sec : framework_for_analysis ] and presented in table  [ tab : mass_estimates ] ) for the mass coefficients of the uniform and nonuniform components of the adsorbate distribution in terms of all combinations of the frequency shifts measured in modes 1 , 3 , and 5including the pseudoinverse result in which three measurements determine the two coefficients in the least squares sense  and we show that the variance among these estimates can be used as an effective tool to judge the combined uncertainty due to measurement error and analytical assumptions .",
    "the multimode measurement technique also tells us about the desorption characteristics of the added molecule , here the explosive 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine ( rdx ) .",
    "in particular , our analytical model is able to discriminate between two situations : ( i ) where rdx molecules are bound to the resonator surface and thus display first - order or langmuir - like rate kinetics ; and ( ii ) where the rdx molecules are bound to each other in crystalline formations ( born from randomly distributed nucleation sites ) , and sublimation occurs primarily from the crystal interface . as we discuss in sec .  [ sec : results ] , our frequency - shift data support the latter interpretation .",
    "this is in keeping with our expectations , since atomic force microscopy studies have already established that rdx forms nanoscale crystallites on the silicon nitride surface ( see the lower panel of fig .  1 in ref .  )",
    ".    our combined experimental and theoretical study of mass distribution and sublimation may be useful not only in the design of future explosive sensors  @xcite but also in a wide range of nanomechanical mass - sensing applications where accurate determination of adsorbed molecular mass is relevant .",
    "we expect it to have particular importance for single - molecule mass spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the nanomechanical devices under study are of a simple , doubly clamped beam architecture : 250-nm - thick ribbons , 23 m wide and 100300 m long .",
    "their out - of - plane vibrational modes oscillate in the mhz range and exhibit quality factors exceeding @xmath0 .",
    "the resonators are fabricated from stoichiometric silicon nitride grown on a sacrificial silicon dioxide layer on top of a silicon handle .",
    "they are patterned using standard optical lithography and reactive ion etching through the nitride and then released using a buffered oxide etch .",
    "( a detailed description of the fabrication process is provided in refs .  . )",
    "the resulting geometry establishes high tensile strain along the length of the beam ; as a consequence , the device acts as a classical string , with its sinusoidal mode shapes  @xcite enabling the analytical treatments that appear in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework_for_analysis ] .",
    "molecules are adsorbed onto the nanostrings by vapor deposition of rdx that has been heated and carried to the sample chip via a flow of nitrogen gas .",
    "it is observed that the rdx preferentially adsorbs onto the silicon nitride and aggregates in clusters , visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : device_image ] .",
    "we employ various masks to gently bias adsorption around the midpoint of the string .",
    "the weak thermal actuation of the string has no effect on where the rdx settles .",
    "measurements are performed using optical interferometry .",
    "light from a hene laser ( 632.8-nm wavelength ) is focused onto the nanostrings , with part of the light reflecting from the surface of the nanostring and part from the silicon substrate underneath the string .",
    "the interference of light therefore encodes information on the relative separation between the nanostring and the substrate as a modulation of the optical intensity .",
    "the laser power incident on the string is no more than 120w , and we have shown elsewhere  @xcite that there is no heating effect .",
    "we focus the laser light halfway along the nanostring .",
    "the even - numbered , out - of - plane vibrational modes have a node there , and so our measurements are not sensitive to them  @xcite .",
    "but for the odd - numbered harmonics that we can detect , the string center is always the point of maximum amplitude ; hence we are able to position the laser spot to high accuracy , and the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement is at its local maximum .    the nanostring chip is placed into an optical - access vacuum chamber , reducing the viscous damping on the resonators  @xcite and enabling thermomechanical measurements of the nanostrings  @xcite .",
    "the resulting vacuum ( @xmath1@xmath2torr ) causes sublimation of the rdx from the nanostrings , which is not observed under ambient conditions  @xcite .",
    "the hene detection laser is not resonant with any of the internal levels of rdx and therefore its light is not adsorbed by the molecule .",
    "a high - frequency zurich lock - in amplifier ( model hf2li , capable of demodulating as many as six independent frequencies ) is used to isolate up to three harmonics that have large thermomechanical displacement at the device midpoint .",
    "we track these harmonics as a function of time in order to extract useful information about the distribution of mass on the device surface and about the characteristics of the rdx sublimation process . in practice ,",
    "the continuous time trace of the optical interferometry measurement , @xmath3 , is used to generate a power spectral density ( psd ) , @xmath4 computed over a sliding time window of duration @xmath5s .",
    "the `` instantaneous '' resonance frequency @xmath6 is obtained at each time @xmath7 by fitting the psd in the vicinity of its @xmath8th peak to the usual ( nearly - lorentzian ) damped harmonic oscillator lineshape , @xmath9 ^ 2 + \\bigl[\\omega \\,\\omega_n(t ) / q_n\\bigr]^2\\bigr\\}$ ] , with the quality factor @xmath10 and the overall amplitude @xmath11 also optimized as part of the fit  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is simple enough that it can be done concurrently with the data acquisition .",
    "we begin by considering the total mechanical energy ( kinetic plus potential ) of a string of length @xmath12 vibrating in one of its normal modes : @xmath13 here , @xmath14 measures the distance along the string ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the angular frequency and displacement profile of mode @xmath8 ; and @xmath17 is the mass per unit length at position @xmath14 .",
    "a small mass perturbation , arising from deposition of a distribution of molecules on the surface of the string , leads to a modified mass distribution @xmath18 and a corresponding frequency shift @xmath19 . to leading order , the variations @xmath20 and @xmath21 leave the energy stationary ( @xmath22 ) ; hence @xmath23 equation   can be understood as a linear relationship @xmath24 between the relative frequency shift and the ratio of the mass added , @xmath25 , to that of the original device , @xmath26 .",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath27 is unique to each mode and depends on how the resonator s own mass and the mass adsorbed on the surface are arranged .",
    "a variety of other effects can come into play when mass impinges on a resonator  @xcite . in devices",
    "whose vibrational modes are dominated by young s modulus terms , a molecular covering can induce surface stresses that significantly alter the bending stiffness  @xcite ( which , in the case of cantilevers , can itself be the basis of a detection scheme  @xcite ) .",
    "additional mass can also provide a new pathway for energy dissipation , so that shifts in the resonant frequencies come about indirectly through changes in the mechanical quality factor .",
    "neither of these effects is relevant to the devices we are studying .",
    "our experiment exploits two properties of nanostrings : ( i ) they live in a high - tension limit where the bending terms are negligible and the vibrational modes are almost perfectly harmonic , and ( ii ) they exhibit high mechanical @xmath28 that is quite robust to the presence of any molecular overlayer .    for a high - tension string ,",
    "the mode shape is a sinusoid @xmath29 ; and , hence @xmath30 [ the reflection symmetry of @xmath31 imposes the fundamental limitation that @xmath32 can not be distinguished from @xmath33 using frequency - shift measurements alone . ] if the unperturbed string has a uniform mass distribution @xmath34 , then eq .",
    "specializes to @xmath35 there are two limits worth emphasizing . in the case of a uniform mass deposition profile , with @xmath36 leading to @xmath37",
    "the mass added @xmath38 can be determined from a _ single _ frequency - shift measurement in any mode .",
    "a strongly peaked profile represents the extreme opposite case .",
    "a point mass @xmath38 deposited at position @xmath39 leads to @xmath40 and hence the unknown values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 must be determined from _ two _ frequency - shift measurements in any pair of modes : specifically , @xmath41 for modes 1 and 2 ( first derived in ref .  ) ; and @xmath42 for modes 1 and 3 .",
    "the general mass - sensing problem , however , is much more difficult than either of these two limits and has the characteristics of an ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "the constant of proportionality in the relationship @xmath43 is undetermined , and there is no way to recover an arbitrary mass profile @xmath32 , except from an infinite number of error - free frequency - shift measurements ( or , in practice , from knowledge of @xmath44 to sufficient accuracy for all @xmath45 up to a cutoff corresponding to the desired spatial resolution ) .",
    "we propose to extract the information from the time evolution of the resonance frequencies in a handful of modes by making some reasonable assumptions about @xmath32 .",
    "we suggest a simple , two - parameter form to represent the distribution of mass deposited on the string : @xmath46 equation   is constructed so that @xmath47 and @xmath48 have units of mass , and the total mass sitting on the string is @xmath49 @xmath47 is nonnegative , but @xmath48 may be of either sign .",
    "@xmath50 describes a convex mass distribution , whereas @xmath51 describes a concave one .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath48 , which follows from @xmath52 , ensures that the mass distribution remains everywhere nonnegative .    the assumptions behind eq .",
    "are that ( i ) the distribution is symmetric under reflection about the midpoint of the string and ( ii ) the distribution is smooth and slowly varying enough that it can be approximated by one component that is uniform across the string and another that places mass preferentially toward ( or away from , when @xmath53 ) its center .",

    "this may be appropriate here since the rdx on the surface is known to aggregate , rather than arranging in a smooth monolayer .",

    "[ fig : shifts_and_mass ] ) and removal time @xmath127s . , width=297 ]    figure  [ fig : mass_profiles ] shows snapshots of the mass profile at various times in the experiment .",
    "such a determination of the real - time mass distribution may have important applications , such as the study of diffusion of molecules along the surface  @xcite , or atomic layer reconstruction  @xcite , of a nanomechanical resonator .",
    "figure  [ fig : decay_rate ] indicates the effective instantaneous decay rate , calculated as per eqs .   and .",
    "one can see clearly that the rate is not constant in time ",
    "and hence it is incompatible with pure exponential decay .",
    "rather , it seems to increase steadily . moreover , between 8000s and 11000s , it turns up in a way that is consistent with the fractional power of @xmath98 found in our fit to the frequency - shift measurements .",
    "it is worth reiterating that this implies that sublimation occurs from the surface of crystallites  and not uniformly from the surface of the device  in agreement with optical ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : device_image ] ) and atomic force ( see ref .  ) microscopy .    something",
    "further we have checked is whether the fitting can be meaningfully improved by allowing @xmath128 to vary along the length of the string .",
    "one might imagine , for instance , that the sublimation rate has a uniform contribution controlled by the partial pressure of rdx in the evacuated chamber and a locally varying component that comes about in some unspecified way from the influence of the mechanical motion .",
    "we have carefully considered various _ ad hoc _ models , but we find consistently that allowing spatial variation in @xmath129 does not improve the fit enough to justify the additional variational degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the sinusoidal mode shape of silicon nitride nanostrings under high tension , we develop analytical models for the multimode frequency shifts that occur as a result of mass deposited onto such devices .",
    "we apply those models to real resonators in the lab and demonstrate our ability to make reliable estimates of the total amount and distribution of adsorbed molecules .",
    "this work provides experimental determination of a nonuniform and nonpointlike mass distribution .",
    "our multimode technique produces reliable , time - evolving estimates of the total mass adsorbed on the resonator with a sensitivity on the order of a few femtograms , even in the absence of detailed knowledge of the initial mass distribution .",
    "the time trace of frequency measurements in a handful of low - lying normal modes is sufficient to reconstruct that missing information and thus fix the otherwise unknown constant of proportionality [ appearing as eq .  ] .",
    "notably , the estimate of the mass added , as determined by our analysis , is often found to disagree with the value arrived at by the more traditional approach , which relies on a frequency shift in a single mode and incorporates no understanding of how the added mass is arranged on the device .",
    "this reveals the extreme importance of such an analysis to accurate mass sensing with nanomechanical resonators .",
    "in addition , because the adsorbed molecules sublimate from the surface of the nanostrings in our experimental system , we have had an opportunity to analyze their desorption characteristics .",
    "real - time measurements allow for significantly improved estimates of the mass distributions and reveal the evolution of those distributions over time .",
    "this may prove a useful tool in studying molecular diffusion  @xcite or the formation of monolayers onto nanomechanical resonators  @xcite .    finally , multimode analysis also leads to insights into the form in which the molecules are removed from the nanostring surface by the vacuum .",
    "specifically , we are able to develop sublimation models that account for uniform - rate loss from the surface and local - mass - dependent loss from the surface area of a crystallite . only the latter is consistent with the observed frequency shifts and the microscopy of the devices .",
    "this may have important applications in real - world sensing of explosive molecules such as rdx , for example in airport passenger and luggage screening .",

    "<S> we report on a series of demonstration experiments , in which the explosive molecule 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine ( rdx ) is vapor deposited along the length of a silicon nitride nanostring to create a dense , random covering of rdx crystallites on the surface . in some cases , the deposition is biased to produce distributions with a slight excess or deficit of mass at the string midpoint . </S>",
    "<S> the added mass is then allowed to sublimate away under vacuum conditions , with the device returning to its original state over about 4h ( and the resonance frequencies , measured via optical interferometry , relaxing back to their pre - mass - deposition values ) . </S>",
    "<S> our claim is that the detailed time trace of observed frequency shifts is rich in information  not only about the _ quantity _ of rdx initially deposited but also about its _ spatial arrangement _ along the nanostring . </S>",
    "<S> the data also reveal that sublimation in this case follows a nontrivial rate law , consistent with mass loss occurring at the exposed surface area of the rdx crystallites . </S>"
