    "@xmath0 meson rare decays @xmath2 and @xmath5 are induced by transitions @xmath6 and @xmath7 via penguin loop diagrams in the quark level , which are usually called flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes . in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath0 meson rare decays may provide a quantitative way to determine the ckm matrix elements @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the sm ,",
    "fcnc transitions are forbidden at tree level .",
    "they can be induced only starting at 1-loop order , which makes their rates for decaying be sensitive to probe new physics . for these reasons , they have long been hot subjects in both experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "nevertheless , one remains facing difficulties in studying exclusive @xmath0 meson rare decays due to the requirment of explicit calculations for the relevant form factors which involve in long distance ingredients that can not be calculated via qcd perturbative theory .",
    "some reasonable nonperturbative methods , such as qcd sum rules , lattice simulations and phenomenological models , have been developped to estimate the long distance effects .",
    "the rare decays have been studied by using light cone sum rules ( lcsr ) in full qcd theory @xcite . as b meson can be treated as a heavy meson containing a single heavy quark , it is of interest to apply for the heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) to deal with the b meson rare decays . in this paper , we shall use the framework and normalization derived in refs.@xcite , which has been applied in refs.@xcite to investigate the exclusive semileptionic @xmath0 decays into @xmath10 and @xmath11 by using the lcsr method and obtained quite reasonable results . a more general study on exclusive semileptonic decays of heavy to light mesons within the framework of hqeft",
    "has recently been carried out in @xcite .",
    "note that as we only keep to the leading order contributions in the expansion of @xmath3 , the results and conclusions are actually independent of any framework of effective field theory of heavy quarks .",
    "we shall focus on in this paper the lcsr calculations of the form factors for the exclusive @xmath0 meson rare decays @xmath2 and @xmath5 within the framework of hqeft . in section [ formulation ] , we first present the hadronic matrix elements in the framework of hqeft and derive a set of formulae for the relevant form factors . in section [ formulation two ] , lcsr approach is applied to the relevant correlator functions in hqeft .",
    "we then obtain four interesting relations among semileptonic type form factors and penguin type ones . of interest ,",
    "these relations are found to hold in whole momentum transfer region in the infinite mass limit of heavy quark or at the leading order of @xmath3 expansion in hqeft .",
    "obviously , at zero recoil of the final light meson , these relations recover the so - called isgur - wise relations@xcite .",
    "in early time , the isgur - wise relations were conjectured to be also valid in the region of large recoil in ref.@xcite . late on",
    ", these relations were really shown in the quark model@xcite to hold at large recoil .",
    "in particular , one of the relations concerning the form factor in radiative decays was shown to hold in the whole momentum transfer by using qcd sum rule approach@xcite .",
    "numerical analysis of form factors is presented in section [ result ] .",
    "recently , one developed the so - called large energy effective theory ( leet ) in which more relations were obtained near large recoil due to additional symmetries in large energy limit@xcite , while some of the relations were found to be broken down by qcd corrections@xcite .",
    "since all relations in ref.@xcite were put forward following from the combination of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and leet and moreover leet is compatible with lcsr , our present method provides a reliable and important way to check the validity of leet relations .",

    "<S> @xmath0 meson rare decays ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are analyzed in the framework of effective field theory of heavy quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the semileptonic and penguin type form factors for these decays are calculated by using the light cone sum rules method at the leading order of @xmath3 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> four exact relations between the two types of form factors are obtained at the leading order of @xmath3 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> of particular , the relations are found to hold for whole momentum transfer region . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the validity of the relations resulted from the large energy effective theory based on the general relations obtained in the present approach . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratios of the rare decays are presented and their potential importance for extracting the ckm matrix elements and probing new physics is emphasized .    # </S>"
