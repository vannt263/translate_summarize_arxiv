    "discovered in 1986 by myers and perry ( mp ) @xcite , the rotating higher - dimensional vacuum black holes have been generalized to include various types of matter fields ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as motivated by supergravity and string theory .",
    "new analytical black hole solutions can be obtained by a number of solution generation techniques .",
    "a straightforward method is based on the kaluza - klein ( kk ) reduction . in the simplest case",
    "this leads to electrically charged einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) black holes for a particular value of the dilaton coupling constant , @xmath0 @xcite . for general dilaton coupling constant @xmath1 , however , rotating emd black hole solutions or their einstein - maxwell ( em ) counterparts need either perturbative techniques @xcite or numerical analysis @xcite .",

    "the emd equations then simplify , leading to cohomogeneity-1 equations .",
    "here we consider such cohomogeneity-1 emd black holes . on the one hand",
    ", we solve the coupled system of emd equations numerically and study the properties of the black holes both for extremal and non - extremal solutions . on the other hand",
    ", we derive the near - horizon solutions for the extremal black holes .",
    "the physical properties of non - extremal black holes , like the horizon area , the gyromagnetic ratio , or the surface gravity then assume values that are bounded by those of the extremal black holes and those of the static black holes .    for extremal mp black holes in odd-@xmath2 dimensions",
    "the horizon area @xmath8 is proportional to the magnitude of the equal angular momenta , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "this relation for extremal black holes represents the limiting case of a more general relation for mp black holes in terms of the inner and outer horizon areas of non - extremal black holes @xcite , and was pointed out in four dimensions before @xcite . in the presence of charge ,",
    "the relation generalizes , and the product of the horizon areas can typically be written as a sum between the squares of the angular momenta and some powers of the charges @xcite .",
    "area - angular momentum - charge inequalities for stable marginally outer trapped surfaces were studied for emd theory in @xcite .",
    "considering such area - angular momentum relations for extremal emd and em black holes , we find that the em case is special , since there are two branches of extremal solutions .",
    "the first branch emerges from the mp black holes and retains the proportionality between angular momentum and area .",
    "thus the charge does not enter here .",
    "the second branch emerges from the higher - dimensional reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes . here",
    "the proportionality between angular momentum and area is lost .",
    "instead there is a new proportionality between angular momentum and horizon angular momentum along this second branch .",

    "we have considered rotating black holes in einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory , which are asymptotically flat , and possess a spherical horizon topology . restricting to odd dimensions , @xmath174 , and angular momenta with equal - magnitude , @xmath323 , @xmath123 , the symmetry of the solutions is enhanced , and the resulting cohomogeneity-1 problem is more amenable to approximate analytical treatment and to numerical analysis .    treating the dilaton coupling constant @xmath1 as a parameter , we have studied the dependence of these solutions on @xmath1 .",
    "global analytical solutions for these rotating charged black holes are only available in the kaluza - klein case . for extremal solutions , however , the near - horizon formalism can be employed to obtain exact solutions , describing a rotating squashed @xmath156 spacetime .",
    "these near - horizon solutions are then interpreted as the neighborhood of the event horizon of extremal black holes .    in the em case",
    ", we found two sets of near - horizon solutions for all odd dimensions . denoting them as the mp branch and the rn branch , since they start at the extremal mp solution and the extremal rn solution , respectively , we noted that the solutions on the mp branch possess proportionality of the angular momenta and the horizon area , whereas the solutions on the rn branch do not . instead these exhibit proportionality of the angular momenta and the horizon angular momenta .",
    "interestingly , the branches cross at a critical point , which we denoted as the matching point",
    ". numerical construction of the extremal solutions then revealed , that only parts of these near - horizon solutions are realized globally .",
    "the sets of global solutions consists of the first part of the mp branch , reaching up to the matching point , and the second part of the rn branch , starting from the matching point .    for the emd solutions , on the other hand",
    ", we found a single set of near - horizon solutions .",
    "but because of the presence of the dilaton field this set depends on one more parameter .",
    "however , this parameter can be eliminated by rescaling , so the physical dependence reduces to two independent parameters .",
    "nevertheless , as in the pure em case , analytical treatment of the extremal kk solutions and numerical construction of the extremal solutions for other values of @xmath1 have revealed that there are near - horizon solutions that are not realized globally .",
    "all extremal emd solutions possess proportionality of the angular momenta and the horizon area .",
    "we have studied the physical properties of these black holes numerically , in particular , their global charges and horizon properties . the scaling symmetry eqs .",
    "( [ scale1])-([scaling ] ) of the solutions has allowed us to give a comprehensive account of all physical properties , by scaling these quantities with the appropriate powers of the mass @xmath44 or angular momentum @xmath182 .    for a given dimension @xmath2 and dilaton coupling constant @xmath1 , any considered physical property of the corresponding family of black holes",
    "then has a domain of existence , which is determined by the set of static black holes on the one hand , and the set of extremal rotating black holes on the other hand .",
    "a generic non - extremal rotating black hole will be found within this domain of existence , whereas outside this domain singular solutions or no solutions at all should be found .",
    "addressing some properties , in particular , we note that the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath55 increases with increasing dimension @xmath2 . for the em case",
    "@xmath108 is a rather good approximation in general , while in the emd case , the gyromagnetic ratio can depend strongly on the scaled charge @xmath105 .",
    "but the ` static ' value , obtained perturbatively in the limit @xmath215 , is a rather good approximation , that becomes exact for @xmath221 .",
    "the horizon electrostatic potential @xmath76 , on the other hand , is remarkably independent of the dimension @xmath2 .",
    "it is significantly influenced only by the dilaton coupling @xmath1 .",
    "the static limit for a given @xmath105 also represents a rather good approximation for the horizon electrostatic potential .    for the scaled surface gravity @xmath321 the static black holes form the upper boundary of the domain of existence , while the extremal rotating black holes have vanishing @xmath139 . at the extremal endpoints of the static curves the surface gravity is zero for @xmath220 at the critical value @xmath299 the surface gravity assumes a finite value , @xmath300 , and for @xmath218 the surface gravity diverges at the endpoint    for the scaled horizon angular velocity @xmath322 ,",
    "on the other hand , the extremal rotating black holes form the upper boundary of the domain of existence , while the static black holes have vanishing @xmath141 .",
    "interestingly , the scaled horizon angular velocity of the extremal rotating black holes can be inferred to good approximation from the scaled surface gravity of the static black holes .",
    "while this relation between the scaled horizon angular velocity and the scaled surface gravity is exact in the kk case , for general @xmath1 it can be seen to arise from the smarr law , the low dependence of the horizon electrostatic potential on the angular momenta , and the closeness of the horizon area of the static solutions to the angular momenta of the extremal rotating solutions .",
    "the surprising finding here is thus , that one can learn much about the extremal rotating solutions from the much simpler static solutions .",
    "we note , that in four dimensions analogous relations hold , when the extremal and the static black hole solutions of em theory are considered , i.e. , the extremal kerr - newman ( kn ) and the static rn solutions , or the kk black holes of @xmath324 emd theory .",
    "we conjecture , that these observations hold also for general dilaton coupling @xmath1 .",
    "since these emd black holes represent a cohomogeneity-2 problem , we have not yet performed the corresponding numerical calculations to obtain the extremal solutions for general @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig10a ] shows , that the electrostatic potential is rather independent of the angular momentum , also for the four - dimensional em case , while the kk solutions again have no dependence on the angular momentum .",
    "moreover , for a given scaled charge , the scaled horizon area of the static rn solutions is very close to the scaled angular momentum of the extremal kn solutions , as long as the scaled charge is not too close to its maximal value , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10b ] . for the kk solutions , on the other hand ,",
    "the scaled horizon area of the static solutions and the extremal solutions is identical .",
    "consequently , it follows from the smarr relation in four dimensions that the scaled surface gravity of the static rn solutions is very close to one - half of the scaled horizon angular velocity of the extremal kn solutions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10c ] . for the kk solutions the relation @xmath325 holds exactly , and",
    "we expect that this relation should hold approximately for all values of the dilaton coupling .    concerning the near - horizon geometry , in @xcite four - dimensional kaluza - klein black holes",
    "are studied . however",
    ", these solutions possess both electric and magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "interestingly , here ( for fixed magnetic charge ) also two branches of black holes are present : the ergo - free branch , which connects to the static rn solution , and the ergo branch , which connects to the extremal kerr solution .",
    "the near - horizon geometry of the ergo - free branch is independent of the particular value of the dilaton at infinity , therefore this branch represents an attactor .",
    "in contrast , the near - horizon geometry of the ergo branch does depend on the value of the dilaton at infinity and so does the value of the dilaton at the horizon .",
    "of course , for a given angular momentum and charge all these solutions are equivalent under the scaling symmetry .",
    "but the scaling relation depends on the asymptotic value of the dilaton .",
    "this property of the ergo branch of four - dimensional emd black holes is similar to what we have found for the branch of extremal emd black holes in odd @xmath2-dimensions , where the geometry at the horizon also depends on the asymptotic value of the dilaton at infinity .",
    "but since the area is proportional to the total angular momentum , if the total angular momentum is fixed , the attractor mechanism works and the entropy does not depend on the value of the dilaton at infinity .",
    "we plan to investigate these four - dimensional emd solutions further , allowing for general values of the dilaton coupling constant @xcite .",
    "another case of interest in this connection is represented by the black holes of einstein - maxwell - chern - simons ( emcs ) theory @xcite . in the supergravity case ,",
    "these black holes are known analytically .",
    "the extremal black holes then again exhibit two branches , an ergo - free branch and an ergo branch .",
    "when the chern - simons ( cs ) coupling constant is increased beyond the supergravity value , one of the branches of extremal black holes becomes counterrotating .",
    "when the cs coupling constant is increased even further , beyond a critical value further branches of extremal black holes arise .    comparing these global emcs solutions to near - horizon solutions",
    ", one realizes that the relation between global solutions and near - horizon solutions becomes even more diverse than observed in emd theory .",
    "in particular , such an emcs near - horizon solution can correspond to i ) more than one global solution , ii ) precisely one global solution , or iii ) no global solution at all .",
    "clearly , only a study of near - horizon solutions is insufficient to clarify the domain of existence of extremal solutions .",
    "thus the construction of the global solutions is indeed essential , as was first observed for the extremal dyonic black holes of @xmath81 gau - bonnet gravity @xcite .",
