    "quasiclassical considerations show that it is energetically favourable to have lumps of strong gluon fields ( instantons ) spread over 4-dimensional euclidian space .",
    "such fields do strongly modify the quark propagation due to the thooft type quark - quark interactions in the background of the instanton vacuum field .",
