    "the masses of the light @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks are fundamental parameters of the standard model and play an important role in low energy hadron phenomenology as well as in our understanding of both chiral symmetry breaking and the origin of mass . until perhaps a year ago , a certain concensus had been reached as qcd sumrules  @xcite and quenched lattice qcd  @xcite yielded compatible values .",
    "however , recent analyses of the cutoff dependence of quenched lattice results have yielded significantly lower values , with an indication that unquenched values could be even smaller  @xcite .",
    "perhaps even more surprising are the results of the dynamical wilson fermion calculation by sesam  @xcite who find very small @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses but a strange quark mass in agreement with the qcd sumrule determinations .",
    "( for even more recent developments , see  @xcite . ) in light of this rather confusing situation , we have sought to derive rigorous lower bounds for the combinations of light quark masses @xmath5 and @xmath1 below which lattice results can not fall without implying a surprising breakdown of perturbative qcd .    in our analysis , we consider two channels .",
    "the first , corresponding to the two  point function @xmath6 with @xmath7 or @xmath8 , is a * pseudoscalar * channel .",
    "the second is a * scalar - isoscalar * channel and is associated with @xmath9 where @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11 .",
    "both two  point functions satisfy a twice subtracted dispersion relation , @xmath12 which relates an integral of the hadronic spectral functions , @xmath13 , to the qcd behavior of the two  point functions in the deep euclidean region .    for @xmath14",
    ", the lhs has an ope , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is   the   relevant   mass  combination , the @xmath17 are known to four loops  @xcite , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 contain mass and condensate corrections  @xcite .",
    "the rhs is determined by the intermediate hadronic states which can contribute to the spectral functions through unitarity : @xmath20 with @xmath21 . for the * pseudoscalar * case ,",
    "the lowest  mass contribution is @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 for the @xmath24 current ) while for the * scalar * case it is @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 contribution is determined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath25 contribution is determined by a single form factor @xmath29 , which has been well studied in the low  energy region  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectral ] ) that the spectral functions are sums of positive terms so that keeping only the lowest  mass contributions gives lower bounds to these functions . then , eq .  ( [ eq : disprel ] ) and",
    "the fact that the @xmath30 are proportional to the square of the quark masses of interest , can be used to translate this bound into a lower bound on these masses .",
    "following @xcite we consider moments of the hadronic continuum integral ( @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 positivity of the spectral function then implies , for the first three moments , @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the first bound we consider is the one arising from @xmath36 .",
    "we find , for the running quark masses : @xmath37 ^ 2 \\ge \\frac{16\\pi^2}{n_c } \\frac{2f_{k}^2 m_{k}^4}{q^4}\\times \\label{eq : sig0bnd}\\\\ & \\times\\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\frac{m_{k}^2}{q^2}\\right)^3 }",
    "\\frac{1}{\\left[1 + \\frac{11}{3}\\frac{\\alpha_{s}(q^2)}{\\pi } + \\cdots\\right ] } \\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the scale at which the ope of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcd2pt ] ) is performed . using three  loop running",
    ", we shall give all numerical results in the @xmath39 scheme at a reference scale of @xmath40 .",
    "clearly , this bound falls off quickly with @xmath38 , so one would like to work with as small a @xmath38 as possible . however at small @xmath38 , the ope of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcd2pt ] ) , and in particular the pqcd expansion , breaks down .",
    "we consider that values of @xmath41 are safe .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] .",
    "= 0.80.90 0.06 0.50 0.82 0.70 0.65    [ fig : ms ]    for low @xmath42 , the preliminary , central , unquenched results of @xcite are excluded .",
    "it should be emphasized that in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] we are comparing a `` calculation '' of the quark masses with a bound which is saturated in the extreme case where all contributions to the spectral function other than @xmath43 are neglected .",
    "the bounds arising from @xmath44 give an improvement due to the fact that higher and higher moments increase the weight of the low  energy part of the hadronic spectral function .",
    "some of this improvement is offset by the fact that the ope converges less and less well so that one has to go out to larger values of @xmath42 .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs when one considers the quadratic bound given by @xmath45 . nevertheless , the net improvement is still significant , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] , where we believe that values of @xmath46 are safe .",
    "we find that even the central quenched values of @xcite may be excluded .",
    "this bound allows less trivial continuum spectral functions than the bound of eq .",
    "[ eq : sig0bnd ] : a @xmath47-function with arbitrary position and weight saturates it .",
    "a quadratic bound can also be derived for @xmath48 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mumd ] .",
    "again , the lattice results of @xcite are in serious difficulty .",
    "note that this bound is significantly more stringent than those of @xcite where different conclusions were drawn .",
    "= 0.80.90 0.06 0.60 0.85 0.70 0.72    [ fig : mumd ]    the known radiative corrections to the @xmath49 are large ( more so as @xmath50 increases ) and positive , and exhibit near geometric growth . to give some measure of the uncertainty associated with potentially large , higher  order terms",
    ", we also show in figs .",
    "[ fig : ms ] and [ fig : mumd ] the quadratic bounds obtained by assuming that the @xmath51 terms are equal to the @xmath52 terms to the power 4/3 .",
    "should this behavior persist to even higher orders , the bounds would be lowered further .",
    "as noted above , the lowest mass contribution to the scalar - isoscalar channel is determined by a form factor , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath53 to two loops and a dispersive analysis yield  @xcite : @xmath54\\ ] ] with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . following the methods of @xcite",
    ", we construct bounds on @xmath48 using this information .",
    "the qcd behavior of @xmath57 is similar to that of @xmath58 up to very small @xmath59 mass corrections which we neglect .",
    "the corresponding ope appears well behaved for @xmath41 .",
    "the bound we obtain is @xmath60 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is a nontrivial function of its arguments .",
    "though this bound is quite similar to the axial current bound of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig0bnd ] ) , it is @xmath62-suppressed and chirally suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath63 .",
    "one might expect , therefore , that it would be much worse ; yet it is surprisingly competitive ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mumd ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the absence of a prominant scalar - isoscalar resonance is compensated by rather large chiral loops and the fact that , numerically , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are not so different .",
    "this bound can be improved by taking into account the phase of @xmath29 which is given by the @xmath66 , @xmath67@xmath67 phase shift in the elastic region @xmath68 .",
    "incorporation of this information requires solving two integral equations  @xcite . restricting to a conservative region , @xmath69",
    ", we use the phase - shift given by a resummation of chiral logs calculated at the two  loop level , which agrees well with available experimental information  @xcite .",
    "the improved bound we obtain is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mumd ] .",
    "again , we find that the lattice determinations of @xcite are in difficulty with this bound .",
    "we should add that the sumrule results of @xcite are all compatible with our lower bounds .",
    "also , since this talk was given , two other attempts at putting bounds on the light - quark masses have been reported @xcite ."
