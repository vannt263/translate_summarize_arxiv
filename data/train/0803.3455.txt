    "users and computers in the internet face a wide range of security risks . of particular concern ,",
    "are _ epidemic risks _ , such as those propagated by worms and viruses .",
    "epidemic risks depend on the behavior of other entities in the network , such as whether or not those entities invest in security solutions to minimize their likelihood of being infected .",
    "our goal in this paper is to analyze the strategic behavior of agents facing such epidemic risks .",
    "the propagation of worms and viruses @xcite , but also many other phenomena in the internet such as the propagation of alerts and patches @xcite or of routing updates @xcite , can be modeled using epidemic spreads through a network . as a result , there is now a vast body of literature on epidemic spreads over a network topology from an initial set of infected nodes to susceptible nodes .",
    "however , much of that work has focused on modeling and understanding the propagation of the epidemics proper , without considering the impact of network effects and externalities .",
    "recent work which did model such effects has been limited to the simple case of two agents , i.e. a two - node network .",
    "for example , reference @xcite proposes a parametric game - theoretic model for such a situation . in the model",
    ", agents decide whether or not to invest in security and agents face a risk of infection which depends on the state of other agents .",
    "the authors show the existence of two nash equilibria ( all agents invest or none invests ) , and suggest that taxation or insurance would be ways to provide incentives for agents to invest ( and therefore reach the `` good '' nash equilibrium ) .",
    "however , their approach does not scale to the case of @xmath0 agents , and it does not handle various network topologies connecting those agents .",
    "our work addresses precisely those limitations . specifically , we study a network of interconnected agents , which are subject to epidemic risks and which can decide whether or not to invest some amount to self - protect and deploy security solutions .",
    "we make three contributions in the paper .",
    "first , we introduce a general model which combines a model for the propagation and dynamics of epidemics among networked agents , as well as an economic model for agents which captures network effects and externalities .",
    "second , we introduce a local mean field ( lmf ) model , which extends the standard mean - field approximation to take into account the correlation structure on local neighborhoods .",
    "third , we solve the lmf model and we derive explicit asymptotic results for general sparse random graphs . ,",
    "for which we obtain asymptotic results .",
    "our main result is that we can explicitly identify the impact of network externalities on the adoptability and deployment of security features . in other words ,",
    "we identify both the economic and network properties that determine the adoption of security technologies .",
    "a similar result is well - known in public economics : in an economy with externalities , the equilibrium outcomes is generally inefficient , i.e. the agents invest too little in self - protection relative to the socially efficient level .",
    "this fact seems very relevant to the situation observed on internet , where under - investment in security solutions and security controls has long been considered an issue .",
    "security managers typically face challenges in providing justification for security investments , and in 2003 , the president s national strategy to secure cyberspace stated that government action is required where `` market failures result in under - investment in cybeysecurity '' @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this situation is that the possible loss can not be avoided completely by a self - protection investment : a residual ( indirect ) risk remains .",
    "this risk depends on the behavior of other agents .",
    "those who invest in self - protection incur some cost and in return receive some individual benefit through the reduced individual expected loss .",
    "but part of the benefit is public : the reduced indirect risk in the economy from which everybody else benefits .",
    "this feature is captured by our simple model of epidemic risks and moreover , we are able to quantify the impact of the underlying network structure linking the agents .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model1 ] , we describe our model for epidemic risks with network effects and externalities . in section [ sec : lmf ] , we introduce our local mean field model ( lmf ) and state asymptotic results that can be obtained with lmf . in section [ sec : netext ] , we use the lmf model to examine both cases when agents invest in strong security solutions ( which perfectly protect the agents deploying them against propagated risks ) and in weak solutions .",
    "we find known phenomena such as free riders and tipping points @xcite .",
    "we also observe counter - intuitive phenomena , such as increasing the quality of the security technology can result in a decreased adoption of that technology in the network . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results and conclude the paper .      the internet has become a fundamental component of modern economies , and it provide services , starting with connectivity , that are strategic to companies , governments , families and individual users , and in general to the well functioning of modern life . as a result , it has become crucial to the various entities ( operators , enterprises , individuals , ... ) that deliver or use internet services to protect the internet infrastructure and the services delivered through that infrastructure ( or the ability of the infrastructure to deliver those services ) against risks .",
    "there are typically four options that individuals or organizations can take in the face of risks and the associated damages : 1 ) avoid the risk , 2 ) retain the risk , 3 ) self - protect and mitigate the risk , and 4 ) transfer the risk .",
    "option 1 involves preventing any action that could involve risk , and it is clearly not realistic for the internet . option 2 involves accepting the loss when it occurs .",
    "option 3 involves investing in methods to reduce the impact of the risk and the severity of the damages .",
    "option 4 involves transferring the risk to another willing party through contract or hedging .",
    "most entities have so far chosen , or are only aware of the possibility of , a mix of options 2 and 3 . as a result ,",
    "these entities have been busy investing in people and devices to identify threats and develop and deploy coutermeasures . in practice , this has led to the development and deployment of a vast array of systems to detect threats and anomalies ( both malicious such as intrusions , denial - of - service attacks , port scanners , worms , viruses , etc . , and non - intentional such as overloads from flash crowds ) and to protect the network infrastructure and its users from the negative impact of those anomalies , along with efforts in the area of security education in an attempt to minimize the risks related to the human factor @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "most of the research on internet security has similarly focused on issues related to option 3 , with an emphasis on algorithms and solutions for threat or anomaly detection , identification , and mitigation .",
    "unfortunately , self protecting against risk or mitigating risk does not eliminate risk .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , there do not always exist fool - proof ways to detect and identify even well defined threats ; for example , even state of the art detectors of port scanners and other known anomalies suffer from non - zero rates of false positives and false negatives @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the originators of threats , and the threats they produce , evolve on their own and in response to detection and mitigation solutions being deployed , which makes it harder to detect and mitigate evolving threat signatures and characteristics @xcite .",
    "other types of damages caused by non - intentional users , such as denial of service as a result of flash crowds , can be predicted and alleviated to some extent but not eliminated altogether .",
    "finally , eliminating risks would require the use of formal methods to design provably secure systems , and formal methods capture with difficulty the presence of those messy humans , even non malicious humans , in the loop @xcite .    in the end ,",
    "despite all the research , time , effort , and investment spent in internet security , there remains a residual risk : the internet infrastructure and its users are still very much at risk , with accounted damages already reaching considerable amounts of money and possible damage even more daunting ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite for a discussion on worm damage and conference web site for an opinion on damage cost estimation . )",
    "the question then is how to handle this residual risk .",
    "one way to handle residual risk which has not been considered in much detail yet is to use the fourth option mentioned above , namely transfer the risk to another willing entity through contract or hedging . a widely used way to do",
    "this is through insurance , which is one type of risk transfer using contracts . in practice",
    ", the risk is transferred to an insurance company , in return for a fee which is the insurance premium .",
    "insurance allows individuals or organizations to smooth payouts for uncertain events ( variable costs of the damages associated with security risks ) into predictable periodic costs . using insurance to handle security risks in the internet",
    "raises several questions : does this option make sense for the internet , under which circumstances ? does it provide benefits , and if so , to whom , and to what extent ?",
    "our goal in this paper is to consider those questions .",
    "the economic approach considers that a limit to insurability can not be defined only on the characteristics of the risk distribution , but should take into account the economic environment .",
    "we take this approach in the paper .",
    "a revoir    in this section , we consider the case of economic agents ( namely , agents that attempt to optimize some kind of utility function ) subject to epidemic risks , when insurance is not available .",
    "we describe a model for this case and describe the relevant results , obtained in @xcite , on the impact of network externalities on the adoption of self - protection . in the next section ,",
    "we augment this model to include an insurance market .",
    "we then solve that model to obtain our main results for this paper .",
    "our models in this and the next section include two components , so to speak : one component describes the economic model of the agents , the other component describes the spread of the security risk ( worm or malware spread , virus attack ... ) among the agents .",
    "we consider simple one - period probabilistic models for the risk , in which all decisions and outcomes occur in a simultaneous instant .",
    "we model agents using the classical expected utility model , where agents attempt to maximize a utility function @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that agents are rational and that they are risk averse , i.e. their utility function is concave ( see proposition 2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "risk averse agents dislike mean - preserving spreads in the distribution of their final wealth .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the initial wealth of the agent . the _ risk premium _",
    "@xmath3 is the maximum amount of money that one is ready to pay to escape a pure risk @xmath4 , where a pure risk @xmath4 is a random variable such that @xmath5=0 $ ] .",
    "the risk premium corresponds to an amount of money paid ( thus decreasing the wealth of the agent from @xmath2 to @xmath6 ) which covers the risk ; hence , @xmath3 is given by the following equation : @xmath7 = \\ee[u[w+x]]$ ] .",
    "each agent faces a potential loss @xmath8 , which we take in this paper to be a fixed ( non - random ) value .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the probability of loss or damage .",
    "there are two possible final states for the agent : a good state , in which the final wealth of the agent is equal to his initial wealth @xmath2 , and a bad state in which the final wealth is @xmath10 .",
    "if the probability of loss is @xmath11 , the risk is clearly not a pure risk .",
    "the amount of money @xmath12 the agent is ready to invest to escape the risk is given by the equation : @xmath13 + ( 1-p)u[w ] = u[w - m].$ ] we clearly have @xmath14 thanks to the concavity of @xmath1",
    ". we can actually relate @xmath12 to the risk premium defined above : @xmath15.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we first recall the model and the main results proved in @xcite .",
    "the model has two levels : one describes the spread of the attack among the agents and the other the economic model for the agents .",
    "we consider simple one - period probabilistic models for the risk , in which all decisions and outcomes occur in a simultaneous instant .",
    "the model for the spread of the attack is an elementary epidemic model .",
    "agents are represented by vertices of a graph .",
    "then any infected agent contaminates neighbors independently of each others with probability @xmath16 .",
    "there is no recovery .",
    "to completely describe the epidemic , we need to specify the initial condition : the set of agents that are active before the contagion process takes place .",
    "this initial state is related to the economic decision of agent concerning his investment in security and this decision depends on the behavior of other entities in the network .",
    "hence we need to briefly describe the model for self - protection .",
    "an agent can invest some amount in self - protection , which in practice would reflect an investment in antivirus or anomaly detection solutions .",
    "if an agent decides to invest in self - protection , we say that the agent is in state @xmath17 ( as in safe or secure ) .",
    "if the agent decides not to invest in self - protection , it is in state @xmath0 ( not safe ) .",
    "if the agent does not invest , its probability of loss is @xmath18 . if it does invest , for an amount which we assume is a fixed amount @xmath19 , then its loss probability is reduced and equal to @xmath20 .    in state @xmath0 ,",
    "the expected utility of the agent is @xmath21+(1-p^n)u[w]$ ] ; in state @xmath17 , the expected utility is @xmath22+(1-p^s)u[w - c]$ ] . using the definition of risk premium , we see that these quantities are equal to @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] , respectively .",
    "therefore , the optimal strategy is for the agent to invest in self - protection only if the cost for self - protection is less than the threshold @xmath25-\\pi[p^s].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we describe now our model for the epidemic risk .",
    "agents are represented by vertices of a graph .",
    "we assume that an agent in state @xmath17 has a probability @xmath26 of direct loss and an agent in state @xmath0 has a probability @xmath27 of direct loss with @xmath28 .",
    "then any infected agent contaminates neighbors independently of each others with probability @xmath29 if the neighbor is in state @xmath17 and @xmath30 if the neighbor is in state @xmath0 , with @xmath31 .",
    "special cases of this model are examined in @xcite , where @xmath32 , and in @xcite , where agents in state @xmath17 are completely secure and can not be infected , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be a graph on a countable vertex set @xmath35 .",
    "agents are represented by vertices of the graph . for @xmath36",
    ", we write @xmath37 if @xmath38 and we say that agents @xmath39 and @xmath40 are neighbors .",
    "the state of agent @xmath39 is represented by @xmath41 ; agent @xmath39 is infected ( respectively healthy ) iff @xmath42 ( respectively @xmath43 ) .",
    "we now describe the fundamental recursion satisfied by the vector @xmath4 .",
    "we first introduce the following sequences of independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables ( r.v . ) :    * @xmath44 bernoulli r.v .",
    "with parameter @xmath26 ; * @xmath45 bernoulli r.v . with parameter @xmath27 ; * @xmath46 bernoulli r.v . with parameter @xmath29 ; * @xmath47 bernoulli r.v . with parameter @xmath30 .",

    "our model is defined by the graph @xmath63 ( which topology is arbitrary ) and the set of equations ( [ eq : rec],[eq : ps],[eq : pn],[eq : d ] ) . in the rest of this paper , we will make a simplifying assumption : we consider a heterogeneous population , where agents differ only in self - protection cost and potential loss",
    ". the cost of protection should not exceed the possible loss , hence @xmath64 .",
    "the cost @xmath65 and the potential loss @xmath66 are known to agent @xmath39 and varies among the population .",
    "hence we model this heterogeneous population by taking the sequence @xmath67 as a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables independent of everything else .",
    "so far , we have not yet specified the underlying graph .",
    "we will consider random families of graphs @xmath68 with @xmath69 vertices and give asymptotic results as @xmath69 tends to infinity . in all cases ,",
    "we assume that the family of graphs @xmath68 is independent of all other processes .",
    "in this section , we introduce our local mean field ( lmf ) model .",
    "it extends the standard mean - field approximation by allowing to model the correlation structure on local neighborhoods .",
    "it can be shown that the lmf gives the exact asymptotic behavior of the process @xmath4 as the number of vertices tends to infinity for sparse random graphs with asymptotic given degree distribution @xmath70 ( see @xcite for a definition ) .",
    "a rigorous proof of this fact can be found in @xcite for a particular case of the model described in section [ sec : stepid ] .",
    "we will not attemp to give a general proof here .",
    "the main tool is the notion of local weak convergence @xcite .      since the graphs we are considering can be considered locally to be like trees ( with high probability ) , we first examine the case where @xmath71 is a tree with nodes @xmath72 and a fixed root @xmath73 . for a node @xmath39 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath74 the generation of @xmath39 , i.e. the length of the minimal path from @xmath73 to @xmath39 .",
    "also we denote @xmath75 if @xmath39 is a children of @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath40 is on the minimal path from @xmath73 to @xmath39 . for an edge @xmath38 with @xmath75 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath77 the sub - tree of @xmath78 with root @xmath39 when deleting edge @xmath79 from @xmath78 .",
    "we have a family of trees @xmath80 and we run the epidemic model according to equation ( [ eq : rec ] ) with the same variables @xmath81 on each tree .",
    "hence the epidemics on the various subtree of @xmath78 are coupled thanks to these random variables .",

    "a consequence ( and this is the main difference with ( [ eq : rec ] ) which makes the model on a tree tractable ) , the random variables @xmath87 with @xmath88 in the right - hand term of ( [ eq : rect ] ) are independent of each others and independent of the @xmath89 . for any node @xmath90",
    ", we just defined @xmath82 and the family @xmath91 is a tree - indexed process called a recursive tree process ( rtp ) .",

    "the tree @xmath78 is now possibly infinite but it is still possible to define an invariant rtp on @xmath78 .",
    "one way to construct it consists in defining a rtp for each finite depth-@xmath93 tree and then show that these rtps converge to an invariant rtp as the depth @xmath93 tends to infinity @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the recursive distributional equation ( rde ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 has distribution @xmath92 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a bernoulli r.v . with parameter @xmath99 ,",

    "then one has to check self - consistency : the fraction of the population for which the best - response consists in investing in self - protection should be @xmath115 .",
    "hence to solve our lmf model , we need to solve the following fixed point equation : @xmath128\\\\ \\label{f1}&=&1-\\ee\\left [ ( 1-a^n)\\prod_{i=1}^n(1-b^n_iy_i)\\right],\\\\ \\nonumber p^{s,\\gamma } & = & \\ee[x(d)|d=1]\\\\ \\label{f2}&=&1-\\ee\\left [ ( 1-a^s)\\prod_{i=1}^n(1-b^s_iy_i)\\right],\\\\ \\label{f3}c^\\gamma & = & ( p^{n,\\gamma}-p^{s,\\gamma})\\ell+\\pi[p^{n,\\gamma}]-\\pi[p^{s,\\gamma}],\\\\ \\label{f4}\\gamma & = & \\pp(c\\leq c^\\gamma),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the distribution of @xmath129 is given by ( [ eq : x ] ) or equivalently the @xmath82 are i.i.d .",

    "the price of anarchy , the most popular measure of the inefficiency of equilibria , is defined as the ratio between the worst objective function value of an equilibrium of the game and that of an optimal outcome ( possibly centralized in which case it will not be described by the model introduced above ) . in our setting , the cost incurred to agent @xmath39 is @xmath134 if it invests in security and @xmath135 otherwise .",
    "so for a given equilibrium , we can compute the total cost incurred to the population .",
    "the price of anarchy is the ratio of the largest ( among all equilibria ) such cost divided by the optimal cost .",
    "the price of anarchy is at least @xmath83 and a value close to @xmath83 indicates that the given outcome is approximately optimal .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an introduction to the inefficiency of equilibria ( in particular chapter 17 ) .",
    "we show in the next section how to compute this price of anarchy .",
    "we next use our lmf model to compare the following situations :    * case 1 : strong protection .",
    "if an agent invest in self - protection , it can not be harmed at all by the actions or inactions of others : @xmath33 ( this is as in @xcite ) * case 2 : weak protection . investing in self - protection does not change the probability of contagion : @xmath32 ( as in @xcite )    in both cases , agents that invest in self - protection incur some cost and in return receive some individual benefit through the reduced individual expected loss . but part of the benefit is public , namely the reduced indirect risk in the economy from which everybody benefits .",
    "hence , there is a negative externality associated with not investing in self - protection , namely the increased risk to others .",
    "we analyze our model on a large sparse random graph @xmath136 on @xmath69 nodes @xmath137 , where each potential edge @xmath79 , @xmath138 is present in the graph with probability @xmath139 , independently for all @xmath140 edges . here",

    "this corresponds to the case of the erds - rnyi graph which has received considerable attention in the past @xcite . as explained in section [ sec : lmf ] , our analysis is not restricted to this class of graphs , but it is simpler in this case since the degree distribution @xmath119 is a poisson distribution with mean @xmath122 ( see remark [ rem : er ] ) .    in this case , the fixed point equation for @xmath110 in proposition [ prop : rde ] becomes : @xmath142 then the equations ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) are given by : @xmath143 for simplicity , we drop the risk adverse condition , so that @xmath144 and we assume that costs for the self - protection are the same for all agents and equal to @xmath19 , and the possible losses are also the same and equal to @xmath8",
    ". then we have @xmath145 recall that an agent decides to invest in self - protection iff @xmath146 .",
    "the monotonicity of @xmath147 in @xmath115 is crucial and it depends on the value of the parameters @xmath148 .",
    "we first consider case 1 where @xmath33 , so that @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "then by proposition [ prop : rde ] , @xmath151 is non - increasing and the fixed point equation ( [ f1],[f2],[f3],[f4 ] ) has a unique solution .     in the vicinity of @xmath152.,width=170 ]    in this case , as @xmath115 the fraction of agents investing in self - protection increases , the incentive to invest in self - protection decreases .",
    "in fact , it is less attractive for an agent to invest in self - protection , should others then decide to do so . as more agents invest , the expected benefit of following suit decreases since there is a reduction in the negative externalities which translates into a lower probability of loss .",
    "hence there is a unique equilibrium point which is a nash equilibrium .",
    "however , there is a wide range of parameters for which the nash equilibrium will not be socially optimal because agents do not take into account the negative externalities they are creating in determining whether to invest or not .",
    "indeed it is easily shown that at least for @xmath153 , the price of anarchy is strictly larger than one ( see figure [ fig : pa1 ] ) .",
    "[ prop : fr ] the fixed point equation ( [ f1],[f2],[f3],[f4 ] ) reduces to @xmath154 it has a unique solution .",
    "the price of anarchy is given by @xmath155 where @xmath110 is the unique solution of @xmath156    see appendix [ ap : fr ] for a proof .",
    "we now consider case 2 where @xmath32 , so that @xmath157 is non - decreasing .",
    "the analysis of this case is described @xcite ( see proposition 5 ) .",
    "the situation is quite different from the results we derived for case 1 above . in particular , we can have two nash equilibria involving everyone or no one investing in security .",
    "when there are two nash equilibria , the socially optimal solution is always for everyone to invest : each agent will find that the cost of investing in self - protection will be justified if it does not incur any negative externalities and society will be better off as well .",
    "we have @xmath158 and    * if @xmath159 , then there is only one nash equilibrium where every agent invest in self - protection ; * if @xmath160 , then there is only one nash equilibrium where no agent invest in self - protection ; * if @xmath161 , then both nash equilibria are possible .    the price of anarchy is given by : @xmath162    if we take @xmath163 , then we have @xmath164 and @xmath165 solution of @xmath166 .",
    "so that we have @xmath167     as a function of @xmath168 , with @xmath152 and @xmath163.,width=170 ]    figure [ fig : price ] shows the value of @xmath169 as a function of @xmath168 .",
    "note that typically @xmath170 so that the price of anarchy can be substantially larger than one .",
    "we have shown that both situations with strong or weak protections exhibit externalities and that the equilibrium is not socially optimal : therefore , there is a market failure .",
    "however there are several important differences to understand between strong and weak protections before trying to resolve this market failure .    in case 1 , the situation is similar to the free - rider problem which arises in the production of public goods . if all then agents invest in self - protection , then the general security level of the network is very high since the probability of loss is zero . but a self - interested agent would not continue to pay for self - protection since it incurs a cost @xmath19 for preventing only direct losses that have very low probabilities .",
    "when the general security level of the network is high , there is no incentive for investing in self - protection .",
    "this results in an under - protected network .",
    "note that in this case , if the cost for self - protection is not prohibitive , there is always a non - negligible fraction of the agents investing in self - protection . in case 2 , the situation is quite different since no agent at all invests in self - protection . even if a small fraction of agents does invest , and",
    "so raises the general level of security of the network , it is not sufficient for the benefit obtained by investing in self - protection for a new agent to be larger than the cost of self - protection .",
    "these facts seem very relevant to the situation observed in the internet , where under - investment in security solutions and security controls has long been considered an issue .",
    "security managers typically face challenges in providing justification for security investments , and in 2003 , the president s national strategy to secure cyberspace stated that government action is required where `` market failures result in under - investment in cybersecurity '' @xcite .",
    "it shows the power of our basic model to note that these interesting and very relevant phenomena emerge from our analysis .",
    "note also that these phenomena correspond to two extreme values of the parameter @xmath29 , namely case 1 corresponds to @xmath171 and case 2 corresponds to @xmath172 . hence taking @xmath163 and fixing all other parameters",
    ", we have a family of models indexed by @xmath29 , denoted simply @xmath16 in what follows , which varies continuously between the two cases .",
    "recall that @xmath16 is the probability of contagion when the agent invests in self - protection .",
    "if @xmath173 , the agent is completely secure whereas for @xmath174 , agents have the same probability of contagion whatever their choices to invest or not in self - protection .",
    "hence @xmath16 can be interpreted as the inverse of the quality of the technology used for self - protection .",
    "first note that when @xmath173 , the technology is perfect since there is no possible loss .",
    "we are in the situation of case 1 and we see that due to purely economic reasons , the technology is under - deployed in the network because people free - ride the benefit of the technology .",
    "consider now the case of an arbitrary @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig : adopt ] shows the adoption curves for different values of @xmath16 .",
    "this curve shows the fraction of the population investing in security technology as a function of its cost ( normalized by the loss ) .",
    "other parameters are @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "we observe some counter - intuitive phenomena .",
    "first for a fixed price , increasing the quality of the security technology can lead to a decrease of its adoption in the population ! here is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises : when the technology is not very good , propagation of the epidemic is possible even if the agent uses the technology",
    ". then agents have to pool their efforts in order to compensate for the weakness of the technology .",
    "in other words , a large number must invest in self - protection in order to have an acceptable level of security .",
    "but when the technology becomes better , then agents that did invest in it start to step down from the group of investors and choose to free - ride .",
    "second there is a barrier for choosing self - protection ( except when @xmath173 ) .",
    "namely for a fixed @xmath16 , we see that there is a range for the parameter @xmath19 ( close to @xmath177 ) such that the population is trapped in state @xmath0 whereas for the same values of the parameters , the situation where a large fraction of the population is investing would be a sustainable equilibrium point .",
    "there is a possibility of tipping or cascading : inducing some agents to invest in self - protection will lead others to follow suit .",
    "the curves of figure [ fig : adopt ] allow us to quantify the minimal number of agents to induce in order to trigger a large cascade of adoption .",
