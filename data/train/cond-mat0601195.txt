    "the first theoretical prediction of the famous phenomenon known as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) was made in 1924 and 1925 by bose @xcite and einstein @xcite , respectively . in a system of particles obeying bose - einstein statistics where the total number of particles is conserved",
    ", there should be a temperature below which a finite fraction of all the particles condense into the same one - particle state @xcite .",
    "seventy years later , in a remarkable experiment , anderson _",
    "_ @xcite have cooled magnetically trapped @xmath0rb gas to nanokelvin temperatures , and observed the bec .",
    "this discovery has generated a huge amount of theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the trapped alkali - metal and atomic hydrogen systems ( which obey the bose - einstein statistics ) is that they are dilute .",
    "the crucial parameter defining the condition of diluteness is the gas parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the density of the system and @xmath3 is the s - wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to bring @xmath4 outside the regime of validity of the mean field description .",
    "the first one is to increase the density , while the second one to change the effective size of the atoms .",
    "the diluteness of the gas is ensured when the effective atomic size is small compared both to the trap size and to the interatomic distance .",
    "however , the effects of inter - particle interactions are of fundamental importance in the study of the bec dilute - gas where the physics should be dominated by two - body collisions described in terms of the s - wave scattering length @xmath3 . in the case of positive @xmath3 , it is equivalent to consider a very dilute ( atomic ) system of hard spheres , whose diameter coincides with the scattering length itself @xcite . the natural starting point for studying the behavior of those systems is the theory of weakly interacting bosons which , for inhomogeneous systems , takes the form of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "this is a mean - field approach for the order parameter associated with the condensate @xcite .    in the present work we study bec in a phenomenological way where the bose gas is considered as a many - body system @xcite . in particular",
    ", we study the ground state of a system of correlated bosonic atoms at zero temperature , trapped by a harmonic oscillator potential ( ho ) .",
    "the key quantities for this effort is the one- and two - body density matrices @xcite .",
    "as the mean - field approach ( non - interacting atoms ) fails to incorporate the interparticle interactions which are necessary for the description of the correlated bose system , we introduce the repulsive interactions among the atoms , through the jastrow correlation functions @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we focus our efforts to the calculation of the one- and two - body density and momentum distributions and the calculation of the static structure factor @xcite .",
    "one - body density and momentum distributions are complementary descriptions of the bose gas and related directly with the mean - square radius and mean kinetic energy of the trapped bose gas respectively . in addition",
    "the two - body density distribution is related with the calculation of the static structure factor , a quantity which gives information for the ground and excited states of the gas .",
    "special effort has been devoted to the derivation of the natural orbital and natural occupation numbers through the diagonalization of the one - body density matrix .    in recent years information - theoretic methods",
    "play an increasing role for the study of quantum mechanical systems .",
    "an example is the application of the maximum entropy principle @xcite ( mep ) to the calculation of the wave function in a potential @xcite using as constraints expectation values of simple observables and reconstructing a quantum wave function from a limited set of expectation values .",
    "the idea behind mep is to choose the least biased result , compatible with the constraints of the problem .",
    "thus the mep provides the least biased description consistent with the available relevant information .",
    "this is done by employing a suitably defined quantum entropy that measures the lack of information associated with the distribution of a quantum state over a given known basis .",
    "information entropy is important for the study of quantum mechanical systems in two cases : first in the clarification of fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and second in the synthesis of probability densities in position and momentum space @xcite .    in the present work special effort",
    "is devoted for the calculation of various quantum information properties including shannon entropy , onicescu energy , kullback - leibler relative entropy and also jensen - shannon divergence .",
    "the information properties are calculated for the interatomic correlations .",
    "in addition the gross - piatevskii equation is solved giving the density and momentum distribution which are employed to calculate the above quantum information properties of the bose gas @xcite .",
    "the results are compared with those taken in a phenomenological way in the framework of the jastrow correlations .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] the general definitions related to the density matrices of a bose system are considered .",
    "details of the lowest - order cluster expansion , analytical expressions and numerical results are reported in sec .",

    "it can be seen that increasing the short range correlations the information entropies @xmath140 and @xmath187 increase .",
