    "the magellanic clouds are ideal regions for studying supernova remnants ( snrs ) , the known distance and low extinction obviating many of the frustrations associated with studying galactic snrs .",
    "while this has proved useful in studying the shell emission produced by the interaction of snrs with the ambient medium , just two magellanic snrs , b0540693 ( @xcite ) and n157b ( @xcite ) , are known to harbor a young energetic pulsar and its surrounding pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the lack of other pwne in the magellanic clouds is likely due to a lack of spatial resolution  such resolution is only now being applied to magellanic snrs in both the radio and x - ray bands , and so the prospects are good for identifying new `` composite '' snrs , containing both outer shells and central pwne .",
    "such sources are of particular interest , as the shell and pwn together provide unique constraints on the properties of the system .    we here present data which demonstrate that  in the lmc is a composite snr .",
    "this _ letter _  primarily discusses the central pwn ; interpretation of the surrounding shell will be the focus of a subsequent paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio observations of  were carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "observations were made simultaneously at 1.4 and 2.4  ghz with a bandwidth of 128  mhz at each frequency , using the 1.5 g and 6.0c configurations on 2002 jul 23 and 2002 aug 26 respectively .",
    "a 38.6-ks x - ray observation of the same field was carried out using the acis - s3 detector of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _  on 2001  dec  18 .",
    "for each radio observation , the time on source was @xmath011  hr .",
    "antenna gains and polarization leakages were calibrated using observations of pks  b0252712 , while the flux density scale was tied to pks  b1934638 .",
    "the radio data were edited , calibrated and imaged using standard techniques ; the resulting resolution at each frequency is listed in table  [ tab_src ] .",
    "analysis of the  data will be reported elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio and x - ray images of snr  are shown in figure  [ fig_all_bands ] . at radio frequencies ,",
    "the source is clearly resolved into two components : a bright central core , embedded in an approximately circular limb - brightened shell .",
    "table  [ tab_src ] lists the flux densities of these two components at 1.4 and 2.4  ghz after applying a correction for the local background .",

    "the brightest region of the core is offset from the center of the shell by @xmath15 .",
    "to the sw , the surface brightness of the core fades with increasing distance from the peak .",
    "the third panel of figure  [ fig_all_bands ] demonstrates that the morphology of  in the soft x - ray band shows a broadly similar structure to that seen in the radio , again revealing a central core within a limb - brightened shell . in the hard x - ray band ( lower panel of fig  [ fig_all_bands ] ) , only the central core is visible .",
    "the extent of this region is @xmath16 ( @xmath17  pc @xmath10 @xmath18  pc ) , less than half that seen in the radio .",
    "figure  [ fig_core ] demonstrates that the positions of the peak emission in the x - ray and radio cores coincide to within the resolution of the observations .",
    "we have carried out a spectral index study of the radio data by smoothing the 1.4 and 2.4  ghz images to a common resolution of @xmath19 and then applying spectral tomography to these maps ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the central core has a flatter radio spectrum than the surrounding shell : tomography implies @xmath20 for the core and @xmath21 for the shell ( @xmath22 ) . assuming @xmath23 for the core between @xmath24 and @xmath25  hz , the radio luminosity of this component is @xmath26  ergs  s@xmath27 .    at x - ray energies , we have determined the spectral properties of the different components of the snr by extracting events from appropriate source and background regions and fitting to the resulting spectra , as will be described in detail by hendrick  ( 2003 ) . to briefly summarize their results ,",

    "the corresponding x - ray luminosity over the energy range 0.510  kev is @xmath34  erg  s@xmath27 .",
    "the spectral fits for the surrounding shell imply an age @xmath35  kyr , a swept - up mass @xmath36 , an upstream density @xmath37 @xmath29 and an initial explosion energy @xmath38  ergs ( @xcite ) .",

    "no radio or x - ray point source corresponding to the central pulsar is apparent .",
    "we can calculate upper limits on the flux from such a source as follows . at radio wavelengths , we made images of the field using only the longest ( @xmath39  meters ) five baselines in each configuration . at both 1.4 and 2.4  ghz ,",
    "the brightest region of the core was still detected in these images . at the peak of nebular emission ,",
    "the corresponding upper limit on a point source is 3  mjy and 0.4  mjy at 1.4 and 2.4  ghz , respectively .    in the x - ray band",
    ", we employed the sherpa  package to carry out a 2d fit to the nebular morphology .",
    "we fit the core with three components : an elliptical gaussian to define the overall shape , an unresolved source to represent an embedded pulsar , and a constant offset to account for background . using these three components",
    ", we find that in the energy range 0.310 kev , the best - fit model contains 58 counts in an unresolved central source .",
    "while the apparent significance of this source seems high , we obtained equally good or better fits by replacing the unresolved component by a resolved gaussian .",
    "this suggests a complex pwn morphology and only marginal evidence for a point source .",
    "therefore , in subsequent discussion we adopt 58 counts as an upper limit , corresponding to a count - rate @xmath40  cts  sec@xmath27 . assuming a column density @xmath41  @xmath31 and a power law spectrum with a photon index @xmath42 ( typical for a young pulsar )",
    ", this corresponds to an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity ( 0.510  kev ) @xmath43  ergs  s@xmath27 .",
    "these radio and x - ray upper limits on emission from a central pulsar are not especially constraining .",
    "our radio limit is @xmath44 times above the upper limit for radio pulsations at this position from the survey of manchester  ( 2003 ) .",
    "several young pulsars have been recently identified with a point - source x - ray luminosity @xmath45  ergs  s@xmath27 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , well below the limit seen here .    in the absence of a direct detection ,",
    "a first guess as to the properties of the pulsar in  can come from comparison with other systems .",
    "there are @xmath46 other shell snrs known to contain a central x - ray / radio pwn ; of these other sources , the properties of  most closely resemble those of the vela  snr and of g0.9 + 0.1 , as demonstrated in table  [ tab_compare ] .",
    "the similarity of these three systems argues that snr  is most likely powered by a `` vela - like '' pulsar ( e.g.@xcite ) , with a spin - period @xmath47  ms , a surface magnetic field @xmath48  g and a spin - down luminosity @xmath49  ergs  s@xmath27 .    in cases in which a pwn has no identified pulsar , considerable further effort has been invested to infer the pulsar s properties ( i.e.  current spin period @xmath50 , initial period @xmath51 , period derivative @xmath52 and surface magnetic field @xmath53 ) from those of its pwn .",
    "the age , spin - down luminosity and surface magnetic field of the system are , respectively : @xmath54,~~ \\dot{e } = 4\\pi^2 i \\frac{\\dot{p}}{p^3},~~ b = 3.2\\times10^{19}(p\\dot{p})^{1/2}~{\\rm gauss } , \\label{eqn_1}\\ ] ] where @xmath55  g  @xmath56 is the star s moment of inertia , @xmath57 is the `` braking index '' , and @xmath50 is in seconds . typically one assumes @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is an assumed efficiency factor ) . @xmath62 and @xmath63 are determined from observations , from which estimates for @xmath50 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can then be derived using equations  ( [ eqn_1 ] ) .    here",
    "we propose an alternative approach , where rather than assuming an ( unphysical ) value of @xmath51 , we use the above expressions to eliminate @xmath50 and @xmath52 , and thus obtain a relation between @xmath53 and @xmath51 .",
    "assuming that @xmath53 is constant with time , the resulting function has absolute maxima in both @xmath53 and @xmath51 .",
    "the robust upper limits on the surface magnetic field and the initial spin period of the neutron star which result are : @xmath64)^{-1/2 } \\left(\\frac{2}{n+1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath65 .",
    "these limits are reasonably insensitive to the value of @xmath66 assumed ; for @xmath67 ( encompassing the range for the four pulsars for which @xmath66 has been directly measured ; e.g.  @xcite ) , we find @xmath68  g and @xmath69  ms for this system . for other pwne",
    ", a solid upper limit is @xmath70 ; we have argued above that the pulsar here is `` vela - like '' , for which @xmath71 is more reasonable ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thus conclude that this pulsar has a surface magnetic field @xmath72  g and an initial spin period @xmath73  ms . these values are consistent with `` typical '' radio pulsars such as the crab ( @xmath74  g , @xmath75  ms ) and vela ( @xmath76  g ) pulsars , but not with the emerging class of young pulsars which are highly magnetized and/or slow initial rotators , such as psrs  j18460258 ( @xmath77  g ; @xcite ) or j12105226 ( @xmath78  ms ; @xcite ) .",
    "chevalier ( 1998 ) divides pwn evolution into successive phases",
    ". the pwn first expands supersonically in the snr interior .",
    "the pwn then collides with the snr reverse shock ; this compresses the pwn and causes it to expand more slowly .",
    "the pulsar s motion can later become supersonic in the shocked snr interior , and it then drives a bow - shock .",
    "if we assume that the pulsar spin - down luminosity is constant in the initial supersonically expanding phase , the radius of the pwn evolves such that @xmath79 , where @xmath80 was the initial expansion velocity of the snr ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we observe @xmath81  pc , @xmath35  kyr and @xmath38  ergs , and we adopt @xmath82  ergs  s@xmath27 . thus if the pwn is still in this phase of evolution , we require @xmath83  , implying an enormous ejected mass @xmath84 .",
    "we thus conclude that the pwn is almost certainly not expanding supersonically , having a radius much smaller than expected in this interpretation .",
    "the brightest radio and x - ray emission from the pwn is offset from the snr s geometric center by @xmath85  pc .",
    "since this peak most likely marks the current position of the unseen pulsar , a possible interpretation is that the pulsar is moving away from its birth site with a transverse velocity @xmath86  .",
    "the radio pwn is clearly elongated , with a fading tail pointing back along the implied direction of motion .",
    "while this is suggestive of a bow shock morphology , this requires that the pulsar be moving supersonically through shocked ejecta . in the sedov solution , this condition is met only when @xmath87 ( @xcite ) . unless the pulsar s motion is at less than @xmath88 to the line - of - sight ( implying a true velocity @xmath89  )",
    ", the pulsar in this system is still too close to the center of its snr to meet this requirement .",
    "the remaining possibility is that this pwn has undergone a reverse shock interaction with its snr , and is now expanding subsonically .",
    "such an interaction begins at an age @xmath90  kyr when @xmath91 ( @xcite ) , consistent with the properties of this source .",
    "the elongated morphology and comparatively small radius seen for the radio pwn are simply accounted for by reverse - shock compression ; the same properties have been similarly interpreted in the other snrs listed in table  [ tab_compare ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "new radio and x - ray observations of snr  in the lmc demonstrate this source to consist of both an outer shell and a central pulsar - powered nebula .",
    "we have used the properties of this snr to infer that the unseen central engine is a typical young radio pulsar , with an initial period @xmath73  ms , a current period @xmath47  ms , a surface field @xmath92  g and a spin - down luminosity @xmath93  erg  s@xmath27 .",
    "the small and elongated radio nebula results from compression of the pwn by the snr reverse shock .",
    "this study demonstrates that several useful constraints on the properties of an unseen pulsar can be inferred from those of its associated pwn and snr , provided that good estimates for the system s distance and age are available . with many new studies of pwne and composite snrs now emerging ,",
    "such an approach can be applied to many other sources .",
    "we thank bob sault for allowing us to carry out the atca observations remotely from harvard university , dick manchester for information on pulsar surveys of the lmc , and eric van der swaluw and patrick slane for useful discussions .",
