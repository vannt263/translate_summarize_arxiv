    "according to the evolutionary theory the main mechanisms driving the evolution of natural populations are darwinian selection , genetic drift , mutation and migration @xcite .",
    "however , these mechanisms alone do not explain the emergence of more complex life forms from simpler units .",
    "the increase in complexity at the organism level is supposed to be related to the emergence of cooperation @xcite .",
    "cooperation goes against the nature of the individuals who are supposed to act selfishly and favor their own genes .",
    "the maintenance of the cooperative behavior is still an intriguing and open topic in evolutionary biology @xcite .",
    "one individual is said to display cooperative behavior if it provides a benefit to another individual or to a group at the expense of its own relative fitness . on the other hand , in a defecting behavior",
    "the recipient gets the benefit of the interaction without reciprocity and paying no cost for the action .",
    "the interaction of rna phage @xmath0 , a viral genotype that synthesises large quantities of products as a common good , and its mutant @xmath1 , a genotype that synthesises less but specialises in sequestering a larger share of the products made by the others , can be described as a cooperator - defector relationship @xcite .",
    "another example is seen in the evolution of metabolic pathways @xcite .",
    "pfeiffer et al . observed similar relationship when studying the trade - off between yield and rate in heterotrophic organisms @xcite .",
    "the main source of energy for survival and reproduction of heterotrophic organisms comes from atp ( adenosine triphosphate ) .",
    "the basic raw material for the synthesis of atp is glucose .",
    "the conversion of glucose in atp occurs mainly through one of two metabolic pathways : fermentation and respiration @xcite .",
    "although respiration is more efficient , i.e. , more energy produced per glucose unit ( high yield ) , it is slower than fermentation . in its turn ,",
    "fermentation inefficiently produces atp but can achieve high rate of growth ( high rate ) at the expense of depletion of the resource .",
    "therefore the conversion of resource into atp , and consequently growth , is driven by a trade - off between yield and rate @xcite .",
    "this trade - off gives rise to a social conflict @xcite .",
    "empirical studies demonstrate that the trade - off between resource uptake and yield is a common place in the microbial world @xcite , which occurs due to biophysical limitations preventing organisms to optimize multiple traits simultaneously .",
    "independent experiments have reported the existence of a negative correlation between rate and yield @xcite .",
    "the respiration mode of processing glucose was made possible about 2.5 billion years ago during the great oxygenation event that introduced free oxygen in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "one important issue is to understand under which conditions the efficient mode of metabolism , which displays a lower growth rate , could arise and fixate .",
    "previous studies have tried to understand the mechanism that can favor the fixation and maintenance of the efficient strain . in",
    "spatially homogeneous populations the most influential factor determining the fate of the population is the resource influx rate . under resource scarcity",
    "the efficient strain tends to dominate , while under the scenario of abundant resource the inefficient strain thrives @xcite . besides",
    ", it has been shown that under the scenario of spatially structured populations or populations structured in groups a more favorable scenario for the fixation of the efficient trait is created @xcite .",
    "following those investigations the coexistence is found under specific conditions in spatially structured populations @xcite , but not found in well - mixed populations .",
    "though , an experimental study with yeast populations in batch culture showed that , in the presence of a toxic metabolite , coexistence can be achieved @xcite .    in the current work ,",
    "we survey the conditions under which a toxic metabolite can promote a stable coexistence of two strains that differ in their metabolic properties .",
    "this study is carried out by finding the solutions and performing a stability analysis of a discrete - time model .",
    "a well - mixed population of variable size with two competing strains is considered .",
    "the competing strains are described as cooperator , denoted by @xmath2 , or defector , represented by @xmath3 .",
    "the former makes efficient use of resource , as it converts resource into atp at high yield .",
    "though strain @xmath2 has a low uptake rate of resource . on the other hand , strain @xmath3 , defector ,",
    "is characterized by a rapid metabolism , and hence it can consume resource at high rate , however its machinery of conversion of resource into atp is inefficient .",
    "the influx of resource into the system ( e.g. glucose ) , hereafter @xmath4 , is kept constant over time and directly influences the population size at stationarity .",
    "the population size is not uniquely determined by the resource influx rate but also by the population composition , as the strains have distinct metabolic properties , thus changing the rate at which the cells divide .    at each generation",
    "every individual goes through the following processes : resource uptake , conversion of the caught resource into energy , which can lead to cell division , and stochastic death .",
    "first there is a competition for the resource . at this stage ,",
    "strains of type @xmath3 , characterized by a rapid metabolism , are stronger competitors , as they present a larger rate of consumption and thus seize a larger portion of the shared resource than strains type @xmath2 .",
    "the amount of resource captured by each strain of type @xmath3 is @xmath5 whereas @xmath6 denotes the amount of resource captured by a strain of type @xmath2 .",
    "the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the consumption rates of strains @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are their population numbers . from eqs .",
    "( [ j ] ) and ( [ j1 ] ) follows that @xmath11 , as required . since by definition a defecting strain displays a larger consumption rate , @xmath12 .",
    "empirical studies suggests that the consumption rate of defectors is ten - fold higher than the consumption rate of cooperators @xcite .    in the subsequent process , the resource",
    "is then converted into energy ( atp ) , and so increasing the individuals energy storage . the increase in the internal energy of a given individual @xmath13 , @xmath14 , of type @xmath15 ,",
    "is given by @xmath16 the functions @xmath17 with @xmath15 determine how efficiently energy is produced from the captured resource for each strain type .",
    "as functional responses @xmath18 , @xmath19 , we choose a holling s type ii function , which displays a decelerating rate of conversion of resource into energy and follows from the assumption that the consumer is restricted by its capability to process the resource .",
    "as such , we propose as functional responses    [ parametrization ] @xmath20    as they should be , the functions depend on the amount of seized resource , @xmath21 , @xmath19 , and the exponents @xmath22 , @xmath19 , tune the efficiency of the process of conversion of resource into energy .",
    "the smaller the @xmath23 is , the more inefficient the metabolic pathway becomes .    as aforementioned , the efficient strain @xmath2 converts resource into internal energy efficiently but at a low consumption rate , while the one that metabolizes fast , strain @xmath3 , exhibits an opposed behavior .",
    "the above scenario is simulated by holding @xmath12 , assuring that strategy @xmath3 has a larger uptake rate , together with the condition @xmath24 .",
    "the latter requirement aims to warrant that the strategy @xmath3 is less efficient in producing energy from the resource .",
    "if @xmath23 is large even a small amount of resource already provides nearly the maximum amount of energy that can be carried out in one life cycle .",
    "the fact that the rapid metabolic pathway is inefficient does not ensue that the strain @xmath3 will not end up producing a amount of energy higher than strain @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , this situation can be achieved in case a large amount of resource is captured . as an example we mention unicellular eukaryotes like yeast @xcite , which concomitantly uses two different pathways of atp production , working as a respiro - fermenting cell .",
    "therefore it is of particular interest the condition @xmath25 , which allows the strain @xmath3 to end up with a larger amount of energy at the expense of a big amount of resource .",
    "under this situation , strain type @xmath2 faces the worst environmental situation and in the case it can be selected for in such conditions it will certainly thrive in more favourable scenarios .",
    "the number of individuals ( cells ) is not fixed but variable over time , being determined by the intrinsic dynamics of the population and the influx of resource into the system .",
    "every generation , each cell divides into two identical cells whenever its energy storage @xmath26 ( group index , @xmath27 ) reaches a threshold value , @xmath28 .",
    "the daughter cells are endowed with half of the energy of the parental cell .",
    "the model assumes that individuals can also die spontaneously with a small probability @xmath29 per generation .",
    "the model also assumes that the growth rates of both strain types are affected due to byproducts ( toxin ) produced by the inefficient strain .",
    "the effect of the toxins on strains @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not the same being simulated as a reduction in the growth rate which is density dependent , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for strains @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the assumption that only the inefficient strain produces the toxin is quite reasonable since the fermentation process gives rise to many byproducts , such as alcohol and acethic acid , which carry substantial amount of free energy . on the other hand",
    ", the respiration process leads to the production of water and carbon dioxide , which are easily released by the cell .",
    "as aforesaid , the model considers two types of strains : strain @xmath2 , which displays a high yield in energy production , and a second strain which is characterized by a high uptake rate of resource though achieves a lower yield in the process of energy conversion . additionally , the strain @xmath3 generates the toxin that directly reduces the growth rate of the two strain types .    as an individual replicates at a rate which is proportional to the rate the cell generates atp , in a discrete - time model formulation the population numbers , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , can be written as    [ modeleq ] @xmath34\\\\      n_c(t+1 ) & = n_c(t ) \\left[1+a_c \\left(1-\\text{e}^{-\\alpha_c s_c}\\right)-\\nu -\\beta\\ , n_d(t)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above equations @xmath35 , @xmath19 represents the population size of strain type @xmath36 at time @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is a necessary rescaling as a cell only divides after its energy storage surpasses the energy threshold @xmath28 .",
    "the other parameters are as defined before .",
    "the set of equations ( [ modeleq ] ) has several solutions . as standard , a solution is the set of values @xmath39 that satisfies the conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the simplest ones are those corresponding to isogenic populations at the steady state , i.e. , either strain @xmath3 or strain @xmath2 remains with the exclusion of the other one .",
    "the extinction of both strain types can also be achieved under very simple assumptions , as discussed later .",
    "of particular interest to us , is the solution that guarantees a stable coexistence of both strain types .",
    "actually , this is the greatest motivation of the current study . below we will present the different situations and possible solutions . a stability analysis to delimit the region of the parameter space at which the solutions are stable",
    "is also carried out .",
    "the possible solutions of eqs .",

    "a trivial solution is @xmath47 ; @xmath48 . calculating the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix of the system",
    "we verify that this solution is stable only when @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "interestingly , we observe that the stability region grows as the resource influx rate @xmath4 increases .",
    "this is a quite striking outcome since in the absence of the toxin , the increase of the amount of resource available to the system favours the fixation of the selfish strain @xmath3 , while harsh envorinmental conditions tends to favour the cooperative trait @xcite .",

    "is increased the fraction and size of the population of the strain @xmath3 is reduced . the same happening to the population of strain @xmath2 as @xmath70 rises .",
    "although we also notice that , for fixed @xmath69 , an augment of @xmath70 favours the population of strain @xmath3 , the opposite situation , fixing @xmath70 and augmenting @xmath69 promotes a much higher variation in the population size of the efficient strain @xmath2 .",
    "we have studied the possible solutions ( extinction , only strain c , only strain d and coexistence ) of a discrete - time model that describes the evolution of two competing metabolic strategies .",
    "the model assumes that the population is unstructured .",
    "one of the strains produces a toxin that affects the net growth rate of both strains , yet with different strength .",
    "as empirically found , the model predicts that the coexistence between a high yield strain and a high rate strain is possible .",
    "this outcome corroborates the fact that structuring is not the only possible mechanism promoting coexistence .    when the effect of the toxin on the efficient strain is negligible , the coexistence between the two strain types is possible for intermediate levels of the relative efficiency , @xmath92 , of the inefficient strain .",
    "as expected , for very low values of @xmath92 the efficient strain dominates while for high values of @xmath92 the inefficient strain dominates .",
    "the novelty comes about with the observation of a coexistence regime which takes place at intermediate values of @xmath92 , which is lacking if the toxin is not considered @xcite .    in the following we explored a more general scenario in which the toxin also attenuates the growth rate of the efficient strain . at this point ,",
    "the analysis relied on values of relative efficiency @xmath92 at which the cooperative strain is not favored in the absence of toxin , and extensively probed the outcome of the model in the parameter space @xmath69 vs @xmath70 .",
    "a striking finding of the model is the observation that the resource influx rate has a prominent role in driving the fate of the population . in a situation where the resource is scarce",
    "the population evolves to a pure population of only individuals of type @xmath3 ( inefficient strain ) and the coexistence solution is always unstable .",

    "the domain of the coexistence solution starts just after the pure strain @xmath3 solution becomes unstable and widens out as the resource influx rate is augmented .",
    "this is quite surprising as the plenty of resource usually favors the defecting behavior @xcite .",
    "however , although a large amount of resource into the system means that the inefficient strain ends up seizing a large amount of resource and consequently has an immediate positive effect on the growth rate , subsequently it also enhances the production of byproducts ( toxin ) .",
