    "the recent data obtained by the absolute radiometer for cosmology , astrophysics and diffuse emission ( arcade2 ) has revived the interest in this question , detecting a diffuse background at frequencies between 3 and 10  ghz that is more then 5@xmath7 above the cobe / firas measurement of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and well in excess of current estimates based on radio source counts .",
    "more precisely @xcite , the inferred value of the antenna temperature as a function of frequency can be expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9  k denotes the thermodynamic temperature of the cmb , @xmath10  k is the normalization of the radio background at @xmath11  ghz , and @xmath12 is the spectral index of the crb , consistent with synchrotron emission from normal galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "diffuse emission in regions far from galaxies is ruled out due to the overproduction of x - rays and @xmath16-rays , so the only possible explanation is that the cosmic radio background is dominated by faint sources below the threshold of @xmath17jy @xcite .    according to @xcite , radio supernovae",
    "make a negligible contribution , and radio - quiet quasars may be responsible for only a few per cent of the emission .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung from the hot gas in galaxy clusters has been shown to contribute about @xmath18  k at @xmath19  ghz ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and the most reasonable candidate to explain the bulk of the crb seems to be the population of ordinary star - forming galaxies at high redshift .    some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have tried to estimate the contribution of free - free emission from star - forming galaxies to the radio background by resorting to phenomenological prescriptions to relate halo mass and star formation activity at different redshifts .",
    "+ however , if the far infrared - radio correlation ( frc ) observed for local galaxies holds at all redshifts , there must be a tight relation between the radio and infrared backgrounds @xcite . from the measured intensity of the latter ,",
    "one concludes that the contribution of star - forming galaxies must be of the order of @xmath20 per cent .    during the last years",
    ", the advances in infrared and sub - millimetric instrumentation have made it possible to investigate the evolution of the frc over a large fraction of the age of the universe , and several recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the correlation is linear at all times , but the normalization is offset towards increasing radio loudness at high redshifts , boosting the expected signal from star - forming galaxies by a significant amount . in the present work ,",
    "we make a quantitative estimate of the contribution of star - forming galaxies to the crb .",
    "the prescription followed to assign radio luminosities as a function of the instantaneous star formation rate is detailed in section  [ sec_individual ] .",
    "the evolution of the far infrared - radio correlation is discussed in section  [ sec_frc ] , and the implications for the cosmic radio background are shown in section  [ sec_crb ] .",
    "our main conclusions are briefly summarized in section  [ sec_conclus ] .",
    "in normal galaxies , radio emission is always associated to star formation ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "young , massive stars produce intense ultraviolet radiation that ionizes the surrounding medium , and thermal bremsstrahlung from these free electrons ( often referred to in the radio literature as _ free - free _ emission ) makes a significant contribution to the galaxy spectra in the few - ghz range . on the other hand , stars with @xmath21 explode as type ii and type ib supernovae at the end of their life cycle .",
    "supernova remnants are thought to accelerate most of the relativistic electrons in normal galaxies , and they constitute the main source of the synchrotron emission that dominates at low frequencies .    assuming a pure hydrogen plasma with an electron temperature @xmath22  k , the free - free luminosity of a galaxy is approximately given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the photon frequency , @xmath25 is a characteristic electron density , and @xmath26 represents the total volume occupied by the radio - emitting , ionized hii regions @xcite .",
    "this volume is set by the condition that the number of ionizing photons @xmath27 emitted by the stars per unit time is equal to the recombination rate @xmath28 with @xmath29 being appropriate for case - b recombination at @xmath22  k. according to stellar population synthesis models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the current star formation rate ( sfr ) of the galaxy , assuming a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in the end , the predicted free - free luminosity @xmath34 scales roughly proportionally with the instantaneous star formation rate .",
    "computing the synchrotron luminosity from first physical principles is much more involved , since it requires knowledge of the amount of cosmic rays injected by supernovae , their spectrum , and the conditions of the surrounding medium ( most notably , its density structure and the intensity of the magnetic field ) .",
    "observationally @xcite , non - thermal synchrotron emission is about 10 times more luminous than the free - free continuum at @xmath19  ghz , and its spectral index is close to @xmath35 for a broad range of star - forming galaxies .",
    "in addition , there is a tight correlation between the synchrotron luminosity and the thermal radiation emitted by the dust in the infrared , which is powered by the stellar ultraviolet light and is thus another tracer of the star formation rate .",
    "the observed far infrared - radio correlation suggests ( but see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a different point of view ) that synchrotron emission is also proportional to the sfr , implying that @xmath36",

    "* ) providing only a minor correction at the level of a few percent , equation  ( [ eq_syn_0 ] ) has a crucial importance .",
    "in particular , the intensity of the crb is extremely sensitive to the evolution in time of the relation between sfr and radio luminosity .",
    "it is not clear , though , whether the far infrared - radio correlation should evolve with redshift , and current observational evidence is far from being conclusive .",
    "while several recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig_integrated ] , the signal is dominated by galaxies at @xmath87 , due to the combined effects of distance dimming and the declining behavior of the cosmic star formation rate at high redshift .",
    "in the present work , we have considered the relationship between the cosmic star formation rate and the radio background from star - forming galaxies in the light of recent measurements of the far infrared - radio correlation at different redshifts , attempting to give a further look into the significant missing flux that has been reported by the arcade2 team .",
    "our main result is that normal galaxies can _ not _ be responsible for the observed signal .",
    "although we think this conclusion is fairly robust , there is always some room for uncertainty .",
    "radio emission in local galaxies has been thoroughly studied , and its properties are well known ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , but different gas compositions and/or temperatures may affect the conversion factor between sfr and radio emission by a significant amount , of the order of several tens of percent .",
    "on the other hand , we use the cosmic star formation rate density to constrain the average emissivity of the universe @xcite .",
    "in contrast to radio source counts , where a population of faint objects below the detection threshold is very difficult to rule out @xcite , it would be extremely unlikely that our proposed fit underestimates the average sfr by more than a factor of two ( dotted lines in figure  [ fig_sfr ] ) .",
    "uncertainties in the imf cancel out with the production rate of ionizing photons given by expression  ( [ eq_q ] ) and are not expected to affect the present analysis significantly .",
    "the most important source of uncertainty is the possible evolution of the far infrared - radio correlation .",
    "current observations seem to be compatible with @xmath5 , increasing the expected emission from normal galaxies by about 70 per cent with respect to the case of no evolution .",
    "using an extreme value @xmath88 would boost the signal by only an additional 35 percent .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth noting that the high - redshift points in figure  [ fig_q ] ( e.g. in the samples of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are dominated by sub - millimeter galaxies .",
    "there is some discussion in the literature that these sources , whose contribution to the total sfr at @xmath89 is only of the order of ten per cent ( see figure 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may be radio - bright compared to normal galaxies and introduce some evolution in the observed frc that does not apply to star formation as a whole decreases to @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , the data at @xmath91 are compatible with @xmath75 ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , one would expect on theoretical grounds that the frc of normal galaxies evolved in the opposite direction ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "on the one hand , star formation at @xmath93 is heavily obscured by dust , and the approximation that all the ultraviolet luminosity is re - radiated in the infrared is very good . in the local universe ,",
    "some fraction of the ionizing photons is able to escape , and the infrared luminosity per unit sfr should be lower . on the other hand , galaxies at high redshift should produce less radio emission because the energy density of the cmb scales as @xmath94 , and the relativistic electrons injected by supernovae lose more energy through inverse compton scattering ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both effects , especially the latter , would only strengthen our conclusions , and the estimate with @xmath86 should arguably be regarded as an upper limit .    according to our results , radio emission from star - forming galaxies could explain up to @xmath95 per cent of the intensity of the crb . even taking all the possible uncertainties into account , we are still far from the 1.19 kelvin reported by arcade2 at 1  ghz .",
    "although evolution of the frc at @xmath87 has to be further investigated , current data strongly suggest that it only results in a relatively minor boost to the contribution of normal galaxies , and hence we can rule them out as the main source for the radio background .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_integrated ] , the contribution of galaxies at higher redshifts is negligible .",
    "since relatively bright point sources , as well as galactic or extragalactic diffuse emission have also been ruled out ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , there are few alternatives left to explain the observed cosmic radio background .",
    "some possibilities are :    1 .",
    "the arcade2 measurement is incorrect , or it is contaminated by galactic foregrounds .",
    "being perfectly consistent with independent measurements at longer wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we think this possibility is unlikely .",
    "faint star - forming galaxies at high redshift are extremely radio bright , perhaps due to an enhanced magnetic field or agn activity with respect to the brightest objects at that redshift ( the possibility favored by * ? ? ?",
    "3 .   there is a new population of numerous and faint radio sources waiting to be discovered .",
