    "the temporal evolution of an initially localized , quantum mechanical wave packet is of fundamental importance for our understanding of the classical and quantum transport , and goes back to schrdinger s early attempts to construct wave groups which behave alike classical particles @xcite . with increasing complexity of the potential landscape , which can be due to its topography as well its topology ,",
    "a panoply of surprising transport phenomena emerge , from ballistic over sub- , super- or just diffusive @xcite to various types of localized transport @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have their respective effective descriptions , e.g. in semiclassical @xcite , mesoscopic @xcite or statistical @xcite terms , and manifest in distinct experimental settings , from light - matter interaction @xcite over fundamental ( quantum ) optics @xcite to ultracold matter @xcite , quantum walks @xcite and biochemistry @xcite . on the fundamental level",
    ", however , all transport properties are hardwired in the spectral properties of the underlying quantum system , and control of the latter implies control of the former . given the stunning experimental control over potential landscapes in variable dimensions , as achieved e.g. in cold matter science over the last decade @xcite , we can contemplate to explore the above diversity of quantum transport phenomena for optimal control , by tuning the decisive spectral properties .",
    "in this paper we study the particularly simple , though paradigmatic case of a tunneling escape from a one dimensional potential well .",
    "the proper choice of the confining potential allows one to induce algebraic rather than exponential decay , for generic , confined initial states .",
    "as described in references @xcite , the crucial ingredient will be an asymptotically scale invariant potential decaying to zero as @xmath0 , which occurs naturally in systems with dipolar interactions @xcite or anomalous molecular binding potentials @xcite , and is often associated with quite counterintuitive effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we thus provide in the next section [ theory ] a particularly transparent example of a scale - free relaxation process , where the equilibrium state is reached only at asymptotically long times @xcite .",
    "the here considered scenario is shown to be robust against unavoidable experimental modifications of the idealized theoretical scenario we depart from . in section [ numeric ] will argue that algebraic , rather than exponential decay , should be observable in modern experiments with expanding bose - einstein condensates @xcite in engineered potentials @xcite .",
    "the final section [ conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the two parameter family of 1d , single particle potentials @xcite @xmath1 we use dimensionless units in the sequel , measuring actions in units of @xmath2 , and giving the particle unit mass .",
    "the exact analytical solution of the schrdinger equation for the potential @xmath3 is available @xcite .",
    "we will however see that , given its asymptotic scaling , the precise form of the confining well is not crucial for the predicted power - law decay of the survival probability .",
    "the potential of equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) has the same asymptotic behavior as in references @xcite , however , differently from the one considered in @xcite it extends over the entire real axis , implying the existence of an equilibrium or ground state .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:1a ] ) ensures that the ground state eigenfunction @xmath4 associated with the eigenvalue @xmath5 is continuous with a continuous first derivative . for @xmath6",
    "one finds @xmath7 , with @xmath8 @xcite , what ensures the square integrability for @xmath9 . for @xmath10 ,",

    "the constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 are set by imposing that @xmath4 is normalized to unity and continuous in @xmath14 .",
    "the continuity of the first derivative in @xmath14 implies the following relation between the three original parameters of the potential @xmath15 besides the discrete eigenvalue @xmath5 , the spectrum of @xmath3 has a continuous component in the range @xmath16 , which is attached to the null eigenvalue .",
    "since the potential is even , we can have odd and even solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
    "for @xmath17 the eigenfunction @xmath18 is a linear combination of bessel functions @xmath19 where @xmath20 . for @xmath10",
    "we find @xmath21 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are fixed by imposing that @xmath18 and its first derivative are continuous in @xmath25 and that @xmath18 are orthonormalized with a @xmath26-function of the energy : @xmath27 .",
    "similar conditions apply to the even solutions .",
    "further details can be found in [ sol ] .",
    "let us now consider the particle prepared in an initial state @xmath28 , given by a linear combination of eigenfunctions @xmath29 , with real coefficients @xmath30 .",
    "its time evolution will be given by @xmath31 where we explicitly assume that @xmath32 .",
    "for our purpose the distribution of participating energies in the initial state should be continuously connected to zero and sufficiently broad , as we will discuss below in more detail .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we are explicitly interested in the survival probability @xmath33 that the particle remains confined within the well , i.e. , @xmath34 by substituting equation @xmath35 we obtain : @xmath36 where @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\         & &   i_1=\\int_{-l}^{+l } dx\\,|\\psi_0(x)|^2 , \\quad                 i_2(e)=\\int_{-l}^{+l } dx\\,\\psi_0(x)\\,\\psi_{e}(x ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\         & &   i_3(e , e')=\\int_{-l}^{+l } dx\\,\\psi_e(x)\\,\\psi_{e'}(x ) .",

    "however , we are interested only in the long - time behavior of @xmath33 , and can therefore take advantage of tools from asymptotic theory of laplace and fourier transforms @xcite , to obtain the asymptotic form of @xmath33 . the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be written as fourier integrals of the type @xmath43 with @xmath44 . by considering the explicit form of the eigenfunctions @xmath4 , @xmath45 ( see below ) , one gets for small values of @xmath46 : @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "hereafter , we will only consider initial conditions @xmath49 for which @xmath32 and the spectral decomposition involves continuum energies that extend down to @xmath5 .",
    "the explicit values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 clearly depend on the initial condition .",
    "hereafter we will give some results for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "for initial states that take non - vanishing values only in the well @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 in the limit @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ smalle ] ) furthermore allows to infer @xmath55 for small values of @xmath46 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are prefactors that depend also on the initial condition .",
    "if the initial state @xmath49 has nonvanishing values outside the well region @xmath52 $ ] , the above results still hold , provided that , for large @xmath58 , @xmath49 exhibits power - law @xmath59 , gaussian @xmath60 , or stretched exponential @xmath61 decay . the leading contribution to the asymptotic long - time behavior of the survival probability",
    "is then found to be associated with the @xmath41 term above , and reads : @xmath62 through the dependence of @xmath56 on the spectral expansion of @xmath49 , via @xmath63 or @xmath50 , the asymptotic decay of @xmath33 also depends on the initial condition .",
    "thus , as anticipated in the introduction , we have shown that the potential of equation @xmath64 induces an algebraic decay in the survival probability @xmath33 , for generic , confined initial states .",
    "in contrast , for an initial state @xmath49 with @xmath65 for @xmath66 ( for some @xmath67 ) , one can show that the survival probability has an exponential cut - off @xmath68 at large @xmath69 , which is a manifestation of the power - law decay arising from continuous spectral components arbitrarily close to the ground state energy .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows @xmath70 for the initial condition @xmath71 .",
    "for some values of @xmath72 , e.g. in @xmath73 and for @xmath74 , @xmath70 vanishes .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of @xmath70 stems from the trigonometric functions in @xmath75 , while the fact that @xmath70 becomes negligible for @xmath76 is induced by @xmath56 , and is therefore related to the initial conditions as used in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of @xmath70 may result in a non - monotonic decay of the survival probability ( an example will be shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , a negative value of @xmath70 implies that the asymptotic value @xmath77 is approached from below and therefore the probability derivative must change sign .",
    "this is not peculiar of the system we are studying here .",
    "in fact , a similar behavior is also observed starting from an usual square well quantum potential @xmath78 when @xmath79 and @xmath80 when @xmath6 , with @xmath71 .",
    "for vanishing @xmath70 , one has to consider the next leading time dependent term in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    in reference",
    "@xcite , according to equation ( 35 ) therein , a specific initial state was chosen whose expansion coefficients @xmath22 show a power - law behavior , although with an exponent different from ours , for @xmath54 .",
    "this implies a power - law for the survival probability which is different from our result of equation ( [ pfinal ] ) .",
    "the main difference between our potential of equation  ( [ eq:1a ] ) and the 1-d potential considered in @xcite is that the latter is defined only on the positive real axis , while our potential extends over the whole real axis .",
    "consequently , in reference @xcite there does not exist a bound state at @xmath5 , leading to a decay without a lower bound , or in other words without control .",
    "in contrast , our equation ( [ pfinal ] ) explicitly takes into account @xmath32 .",
    "another difference with respect to reference @xcite is that we explicitly study the survival probability inside the quantum well , as defined in equation  ( [ eq : pp - sur ] ) and in view of our proposed experiment in section [ sect : proposal ] , and not the fidelity function considered in @xcite .     of the algebraically decaying term in ( 7 ) , for the potential ( [ eq:1 ] ) and different initial conditions : ( i ) dirac delta @xmath71 ( solid red line ) ;",
    "( ii ) water bag @xmath81 in [ -l , l ] and @xmath82 outside ( dashed blue line ) ; ( iii ) gaussian distribution @xmath83 , with widths @xmath84 ( dotted green line ) and ( iv ) @xmath85 ( dash - dotted magenta line ) . ]      in this section we will show that the mere absence of a gap between the null eigenvalue and the continuum part of the spectrum , is a necessary but not sufficient condition in order to observe a power - law decaying survival probability .    in general , any schrdinger potential that asymptotically decays to zero like @xmath86 would have a continuum part of the spectrum attached to the null eigenvalue .",
    "let us now therefore consider the more general case of a schrdinger potential @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are real positive constants .",
    "let us call @xmath92 the eigenfunctions associated to such potential .",
    "in this case , we can only obtain the eigenfunction associated to the null eigenvalue : @xmath93 the eigenfunctions relative to the continuum part of the spectrum are not known .",
    "the parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be chosen in such a way that the spectrum contains one single discrete eigenvalue @xmath94 and a continuous part for @xmath16 . as a result ,",
    "the parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are not independent .",
    "in fact , the continuity of @xmath95 in @xmath25 provides a relation between them @xmath96 in the following we consider @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath91 as independent parameters and will obtain @xmath90 by numerically solving the above equation",
    ".    we will prove below that the survival probability of the above process of equation @xmath97 is not in general power - law decaying .",
    "in fact , we will show that the @xmath50 term may eventually decay like a power - law for large time values only for very specific initial conditions .",
    "let us make two preliminary observations .",
    "first , it is worth mentioning that by using the orthogonality relation : @xmath98 one can prove the following identity : @xmath99 for @xmath39 as defined in equation  ( [ eq : def ] ) .",
    "secondly , we notice that in order to have @xmath100 one must have that @xmath101 for small energy values .",
    "let us now consider the large @xmath102 behavior of @xmath103 . for large values of @xmath102 the potential vanishes thus @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , by using equation @xmath105 and equation @xmath106 in chapter 3 of reference @xcite , the _ ansatz _ @xmath107 would give : @xmath108 this result implies that @xmath109 should decay according to a power - law , given equation @xmath105 .",
    "however , by using equation @xmath110 one has that : @xmath111 showing that @xmath112 can not behave as a power - law for small values of @xmath46 when @xmath113 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that when @xmath114 , then the above _ ansatz _ holds true with @xmath115 . in this case",
    ", one would get @xmath116 , that is in agreement with the fact that @xmath117 for large @xmath102 values .",
    "we have therefore shown that @xmath112 is not growing like a power - law for small energy values . therefore in order to have a power - law decay in @xmath41 one has to engineer appropriate initial conditions such that @xmath118 behaves like a power - law for small energy values . in conclusion , the absence of an upper bound for the time - scale is a necessary but not sufficient condition in order to observe a power - law decaying auto - correlation function .",
    "this also implies that the decay of the survival probability is faster for @xmath119 than for the case with @xmath114 .",
    "for @xmath120 ( black solid line ) , and of the initial state @xmath49 ( red dashed line ) , equation @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "the thick blue line shows the ground state energy level within the well . ]",
    "because of its discontinuities , it is difficult to reproduce @xmath123 experimentally or in numerical simulations . we therefore consider the smoothed version @xmath124 defined as @xcite @xmath125 in our subsequent numerical tests . also this potential has a continuous spectrum attached to the null eigenvalue , and decays as @xmath126 at @xmath127 .",
    "we are interested in the relaxation properties of wave - packets prepared inside the potential well ( see figure  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we define the survival probability over the region bounded by the potential maxima at @xmath128 : @xmath129 our observable is the approach of the survival probability to its asymptotic constant value @xmath130 described by equation  ( [ pfinal ] ) , i.e. , the quantity @xmath131 even if we simulate the evolution of the initial wave packet only in one dimension , the numerical computations take quite a long time for several reasons .",
    "first of all , we need to propagate sufficiently far out into the tails of the potential , while  at the same time ",
    "the expansion of the decaying parts is rather fast due to the high energy components of the initial state .",
    "this is also the reason why simple absorption methods at the numerical boundary do not work very well since those are typically adapted to absorb just a small window of energies with sufficient precision .",
    "moreover , in order to estimate the asymptotic probability @xmath132 , which is not analytically known for the smooth potential @xmath133 , we must propagate considerably longer than shown in the following figures , for which we approximate @xmath132 by @xmath134 , with @xmath135 .    , for a water - bag like initial state of equation @xmath121 with @xmath136 and @xmath137 , and increasing values of @xmath138 ( black dashed line ) , 3.2 ( blue dot - dashed ) , 4 ( thick green solid line ) .",
    "the straight black line fits are chosen according to the prediction with exponent @xmath139 from equation  ( 7 ) . ]    for the actual observation of the predicted asymptotic behavior the precise form of the initial state prepared in the well is not crucial , provided it is given by a coherent superposition of energy eigenstates from a continuous energy range including the ground state energy .",
    "we consider a smooth initial state @xmath140 \\left [ 1 + \\exp \\left ( -(x+x_c)\\sigma \\right ) \\right ] }   \\ , , \\label{psi_init}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is a normalization constant .",
    "the problem defined by the potential of equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) is not exactly solvable unfortunately .",
    "therefore the expansion coefficients @xmath30 are not known .",
    "this prevents us from giving an analytical solution for the survival probability , given the above initial state .",
    "we are therefore forced to perform numerical simulations , as detailed below . however , the fact that the expansion coefficients are not known makes it also difficult to estimate what is the initial population of the states in the continuum part of the spectrum .",
    "we can , however , estimated the mean energy @xmath142 of the initial state of equation ( [ psi_init ] ) . by using the parameters of figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    ", we get for instance @xmath143 .    the initial state ( [ psi_init ] ) , shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] , is numerically propagated in real time using an implicit norm - preserving crank - nicolson integration scheme @xcite , which also controls the boundary conditions very well @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] reports the results of the numerical simulations .",
    "one can observe a clear algebraic decay as predicted by equation  ( 7 ) , for various values of @xmath72 which induce different algebraic decay exponents .",
    "the power - law decay emerges the earlier , the larger the weight factor @xmath70 in ( 7 ) . the asymptotic value @xmath144 is approached from above ( @xmath145 ) or from below ( @xmath146 ) , depending on this factor s sign ( compare figure  1 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "a change of sign of @xmath147 at finite times induces the discontinuities in the first derivative on the logarithmic scale of figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "for fixed @xmath72 , the power - law scaling regime may be further enhanced by adapting the precise form of the initial state ( e.g. by the above parameter @xmath148 ) , and also by changing the second parameter @xmath149 of the potential of equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "both enter our approximate formula for the prefactor @xmath70 , see equation  ( [ p2 ] ) and figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the figure explicitly shows how the decay of the survival probability may not necessarily be monotonic as , for example , in the green and blue curves .",
    "the effect is magnified by the logarithmic scale . as mentioned in section [ theory - a ] , this is connected with the pre - factor @xmath70 , which inverts its sign , as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we do not have a precise physical explanation of this oscillatory behavior .",
    "indeed , the time evolution of @xmath45 is highly nontrivial .",
    "this induces an alternation between ( i ) phases when the the bulk of the state is outside the well , and therefore we observe a depletion of the survival probability , and ( ii ) phases when there is a re - entrance of the state within the well , which causes a partial restoration of the survival probability .",
    "in fact , no matter its mean energy , @xmath150 is the linear superposition of eigenstates some of which have very low energies , in particular smaller than @xmath151 .",
    "exactly these low energy components give rise to the observed power - law in the survival probability after the transient , as we have shown in section [ theory - a ] .",
    "the oscillatory transient behavior is also present for a simple square - well potential , which tells us that the transient should mainly be caused by the high - energy components contributing to the dynamics while the initial state relaxes in the well .      in the following",
    "we will show that the predicted power - law decay is robust with respect to realistic experimental situations .",
    "the only parameter which needs to be controlled very well is the exponent of the potential tails , i.e. @xmath91 in the asymptotics of the potential scaling as @xmath152 .",
    "we use the form @xmath153 which for @xmath114 recovers @xmath124 from equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) .    for @xmath154 , the dynamics of the system will be qualitatively very different , as we show in figure  [ fig:4new ] directly for the survival probability . instead of an asymptotically slow saturation toward the ground state within the potential , we observe a fast decay  with approximately constant slopes  for all values @xmath119 along the same time scales as in figure  [ fig:3 ] .    as described above around equation  ( [ eq : p - sur ] ) , it is computationally hard to estimate the saturation value of the survival probabilities , since the ground states are not known analytically and the data for @xmath154 implies that a reliable numerical estimate will be possible only after much longer propagations than shown in the figures .",
    "this may cause the wrong impression suggested by the main panels of figure  [ fig:4new ] : the ground state is approached in shorter _ absolute _ time for @xmath114 as compared to the other values of @xmath91 , yet what counts is the _ rate _ of approach which is always smaller for @xmath155 .",
    "this is what we intend as _ slower _ decay in the latter case and the reason for plotting the slopes defined by @xmath156 in the insets , with @xmath157 . in order to obtained comparable values , we divided by the extremal values , see the denominator of ( [ eq : p - sur - slope ] ) , which all occur at the minimal time @xmath158 ( chosen after non - universal transients at still smaller times ) . only in the special case of @xmath114 ,",
    "the relaxation to the steady - state value becomes much slower with time , see the fast decreasing slopes in the insets ( black solid line ) .",
    "the shown numerical results confirm the theoretical discussion above in section [ mupot ] , predicting in essence a faster approach to the ground or equilibrium state for @xmath119 .",
    "consequently , a possible experiment should control the exponent to be equal to two at least at 2 - 3 significant digits , in order to observe the power - law decay discussed in sections [ theory - a ] and [ num - model ] .",
    ", for a water - bag like initial state of equation @xmath121 with @xmath159 , for well parameters @xmath160 ( a ) and @xmath161 ( b ) , and asymptotics with exponents @xmath162 ( green dotted line ) , @xmath163 ( blue dashed line ) and @xmath114 ( black solid line ) , respectively .",
    "the insets show , for @xmath164 , the decay rates or slopes defined in ( [ eq : p - sur - slope ] ) : @xmath165 vs. @xmath166 , with @xmath157 .",
    "hence , we observe a relaxation with a fast decreasing slop as @xmath167 , in the special case of @xmath114 . in all the other cases",
    "the slope remains almost constant over the shown times , implying a much faster decay with time . ]",
    "let us conclude with an experimental protocol to test our prediction ( [ pfinal ] ) .",
    "we have in mind a bose - einstein condensate prepared in an optical trap which then is exposed to a potential of the form of equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) while the trap is relaxed .",
    "the potential may hereby be created optically , for instance , with a fast moving laser beam @xcite or by holographic techniques @xcite .",
    "a gaussian initial state of the form @xmath168 is initially prepared in a harmonic trap with characteristic oscillator length @xmath169 .",
    "@xmath141 is a normalization constant .",
    "then the smooth potential ( [ eq:2 ] ) is switched on , while we switch off or relax the trap abruptly to a shallow confinement characterized by the harmonic oscillator length @xmath170 . in the case of figure  [ fig:5 ]",
    "we consider values from @xmath171 to @xmath172 , and @xmath173 . in the absence of a trap ( thick blue lines ) , the gaussian initial state exhibits a behavior similar to that of the smooth water - bag state from above , equation  ( [ psi_init ] ) . a shallow trap with large @xmath174 manifests at long times , by an exponential cut - off of @xmath175 , as shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] , since the potential s asymptotics are changed by the trap .",
    "this induces a spectral gap between the ground state energy and the continuum component , while it is specifically the absence of the gap which is responsible for the algebraic decay , as discussed in section [ theory - a ]",

    "indeed , we observe such a continuous degradation of the asymptotic law with exponent @xmath176 when making the additional confinement steeper .",
