    "historically , all bulges were assumed to be little elliptical galaxies residing in the centers of galactic disks .",
    "thus it was also assumed that all bulges were dynamically hot stellar systems .",
    "recent work puts this assumption in question .",
    "many bulges have disk - like features that do not resemble e - type galaxies .    _ classical bulges _ are dynamically hot , and relatively featureless ; they appear similar to the end products of galaxy major mergers .",
    "they are easily recognized as having morphologies very similar to e - type galaxies .    in contrast , many bulges have features that are not found in elliptical galaxies , but in galactic disks .",
    "these features include the following : kinematics dominated by rotation @xcite ; flattening similar to that of their outer disk @xcite ; mid - ir colors of the bulge are similar to those of the outer disk @xcite ; nuclear bar @xcite ; nuclear ring and/or nuclear spiral @xcite ; near - exponential surface brightness profiles @xcite .",
    "bulges with such properties are called _",
    "pseudobulges_. all of these phenomena are manifestations of stellar systems that that are dynamically cold .",
    "however , the extent to which these features exist simultaneously in all pseudobulges is not yet well - understood . for a review of the properties of pseudobulges",
    "see @xcite ( kk04 hereafter ) .",
    "in this paper , we refer to the super - set of the two systems simply as _ bulges_. we note that in this paper the term _ pseudobulge _ refers to bulges with morphology reminiscent of disk galaxies ; there is no _ a priori _ assumption about their formation mechanism .",
    "investigating the link between bulge morphology and bulge structural parameters is the main interest of this article .",
    "more precisely , those bulges with morphologies that are reminiscent of disks ( such as nuclear rings , nuclear bars and nuclear spirals ) are expected to have lower srsic index than those bulges with smooth light distributions resembling e - type galaxies .",
    "we will investigate whether this expectation holds and whether the distribution of bulge srsic indices is dichotomous .",
    "determining whether a critical srsic index that discriminates between classical bulges and pseudobulges exists , and what its value is , impacts our understanding of bulge formation in at least two ways .",
    "first , the distribution of srsic indices would constrain formation theories of classical bulges and pseudobulges .",
    "also , the existence of a critical srsic index would robustly establish a method for distinguishing pseudobulges from classical bulges without using high - resolution imaging or kinematic data , neither of which is currently available in large surveys .    in the last ten years",
    ", the subject of surface brightness profiles of bulges and elliptical galaxies has experienced a shift of paradigm .",
    "traditionally , surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies and bulges were all thought to be of a single shape that is well - characterized by the de vaucauleurs @xmath4 profile .",
    "@xcite show that surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies are better fit by srsic profiles @xcite , which generalize the exponent in the de vaucauleurs profile to a free parameter .",
    "also , @xcite show that many bulge - disk galaxies are better described by a double exponential than an inner @xmath4 profile with an outer exponential .",
    "@xcite generalize this to show that bulge - disk galaxies are better fit by inner srsic profiles with outer exponential disks than double exponentials profiles .",
    "the srsic function plus outer disk model for bulge - disk galaxies reads @xmath5 + i_d\\exp\\left[-(r / h ) \\right ] \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the central surface brightness and scale length of the bulge , @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the central surface brightness and scale length of the outer disk , and @xmath0 represents the bulge srsic index .",
    "it is not surprising that srsic profiles fit bulge surface brightness profiles better than @xmath4-profiles , since the srsic function has more flexibility due to the extra parameter .",
    "however , the new parameter , @xmath0 , correlates with many properties of the stellar systems to which it is fit , including but not limited to the following : velocity dispersion @xmath10 @xcite , absolute magnitude @xcite , and effective radius @xcite .",
    "many authors have shown that these correlations extend to bulges of bulge - disk galaxies @xcite . additionally , @xcite",
    "show that the srsic index of bulges correlates with hubble type , decreasing from @xmath11 for s0 galaxies to @xmath12 in sbc - sd galaxies .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that it has physical significance .",
    "the srsic index is often referred to as the shape parameter , as it is generally taken as a surrogate for properties such as concentration of the surface brightness profile . for a review of the properties of srsic profiles",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the tentative assumption is that the srsic index of a bulge reflects the classical bulge - pseudobulge dichotomy .",
    "lower srsic index might indicate that a bulge is more likely to be a pseudobulge .",
    "we do not understand the mechanism that is responsible for determining the srsic indices in pseudobulges ( or classical bulges ) . yet",
    ", it seems plausible that the light distribution be similar to that of a disk , since so many other of the properties of pseudobulges are similar to those of galactic disks .",
    "@xcite use bulge - disk decompositions of 243 galaxies to show that the 85% of bulges in sb - sc galaxies are better fit by the double exponential than cuspier @xmath4 models .",
    "thus , the common conclusion is that pseudobulges are marked by near exponential srsic index ( kk04 ) .",
    "@xcite shows with stis acquisition images that bulges with surface brightness profiles more resembling exponential profiles are more likely to have disk - like morphology ( e.g.  spiral arms ) , yet there is significant scatter to this claim , in their sample .",
    "they go on to show that the distribution of central slopes of surface brightness profiles of the bulges in their sample is bimodal when plotted against absolute magnitude .",
    "it is yet unknown where pseudobulges should lie in other parameter correlations , such as fundamental plane projections .",
    "we do not expect that pseudobulges occupy a significantly different location than classical bulges in fundamental plane parameter space , since the fundamental plane is not known to be bimodal .",
    "many studies of the locations of bulges in structural parameter space exist ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and no significant bimodal behavior is noticed .",
    "@xcite remarks , though , that pseudobulges deviate more from the @xmath13 relation @xcite .",
    "we will investigate this further in this paper .",
    "@xcite shows that the majority of bulges are rounder than the outer parts of the disks they reside in , yet a significant minority are as flat as their associated outer disk .",
    "a few bulges are even flatter than their outer disk .",
    "this behavior correlates with hubble type ; bulges in later type galaxies have flattening more similar to that of the associated outer disk .",
    "@xcite carried out bulge - disk decompositions of 70 galaxies on higher - resolution data finding a similar result .    as discussed in kk04 ,",
    "pseudobulges are characterized principally by having less random motion per unit stellar light .",
    "they are rotation - dominated systems @xcite .",
    "thus it makes sense that they be flatter .",
    "the relative flatness of a bulge to its associated outer disk has also been suggested as a pseudobulge indicator ( kk04 ) .",
    "we will test this hypothesis in this paper by comparing the flatness of bulges with disk like morphologies to that of bulges with morphologies like those of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the properties of pseudobulges are in stark contrast to the expected end result of the hierarchical merging process ; one does not expect violent relaxation to produce spiral structure and dynamics that is dominated by ordered motion .",
    "further scenarions for the formation of bulges have been suggested .",
    "clump instabilities in disks at high redshift can form bulge - like structures in simulations @xcite .",
    "it is also plausible that gas rich accretion could form dynamically cold bulges .",
    "internal evolution of disks can drive gas and stars to the center of a disk galaxy as well .",
    "the population of bulges as a whole and any one particular bulge may be the result of more than one of these processes .",
    "however , the connections between bulge and disk stellar populations @xcite , inter - stellar medium @xcite and scale lengths @xcite may suggest that pseudobulges form through processes intimately linked to their host disks .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that classical bulges occur in red - sequence galaxies and pseudobulges occur in blue cloud galaxies .",
    "@xcite reviews the case that pseudobulges are not the result of major mergers , but rather that internal disk - evolution may be responsible for them .",
    "however , that bulges can form out of the internal evolution of a disk is not a new idea ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "simulations suggest that if disk galaxies do not experience major mergers , they may evolve by redistribution of energy and angular momentum driven by non - axisymmetries such as bars , ovals , and spiral structure @xcite , resulting in star formation and bulge - like stellar densities , thus forming pseudobulges .",
    "indeed , a correlation between central star formation rate and the presence of bars and ovals has been detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , @xcite find that galaxies with nuclear rings and/or nuclear spirals are more strongly barred .",
    "thus we also investigate the possible connection between driving mechanisms and structural properties .",
    "it is , thus , possible that the absence of a classical bulge in a galaxy indicates that the galaxy has not experienced a major merger since the formation of the disk . in this context , pseudobulges may be thought of as more similar to pure disk galaxies that have a surface brightness profile which breaks from the outer exponential profile to a more steep inner surface brightness profile .",
    "though the frequency of pseudobulges has not yet been robustly calculated , if they are common then this implies that many disk galaxies did not suffer major mergers since their formation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   2 we present the observational data we use , and we discuss the surface brightness fitting procedure . in ",
    "3 we present results on the location of pseudobulges and classical bulges in various structural parameter correlations . in   4 we discuss the flatness of pseudobulges and classical bulges . in   5 , we discuss behavior of different bulge morphologies ( nuclear bars , nuclear spirals , and nuclear rings ) in various parameter correlations . in   6 we summarize and discuss these results .",
    "finally , the appendix includes an image of each galaxy , all decompositions and a discussion of the robustness of our decomposition and fitting procedure .",
    "the aim of this work is to establish whether or not pseudobulges  recognized by the presence of disk - like morphological features as motivated and discussed in kk04  can be distinguished from classical bulges simply by structural features in their surface brightness profiles , most prominently their profile shape .",
    "thus we ask whether bulges that contain disk - like morphologies ( pseudobulges ) have lower srsic index and higher flattening ratios than bulges with elliptical - like morphologies ( classical bulges ) .",
    "answering this question requires high resolution imaging ( preferably in the optical bands ) to detect the nuclear spirals , bars , and rings ; and we need surface brightness profiles with large dynamic range in radius to accurately determine the parameters in eq .  1 for a bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "we choose galaxies observable from the northern hemisphere that have data in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) archive .",
    "we limit our selection to galaxies closer than @xmath14  mpc to resolve features in the bulge .",
    "the link between non - axisymmetries ( barred and oval distortions ) and secular evolution motivates us to create a sample containing roughly equal numbers of galaxies with a driving agent ( galaxies with a bar and/or an oval ) and galaxies without a driving agent .",
    "detection of oval distortions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "they are identified by nested shelves in the surface brightness profile usually having different position angles .",
    "we identify bars by consulting the carnegie atlas of galaxies @xcite and the rc3 @xcite .",
    "if a galaxy has both a bar and an oval , we call that galaxy barred .",
    "additionally , we look for bars and ovals in all galaxies using k - band images from 2mass @xcite . note that we do not distinguish grand design spirals as a possible secular driver , though they may be able to generate a similar but less extreme effect as bars do ( kk04 ) .",
    "we use 39 undriven ( no bar and no oval ) galaxies and 38 driven galaxies ( 30 barred and 8 ovaled ) , a total of 77 galaxies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] we show the distribution of global properties of the galaxies in our sample ; these are also listed in table 1 .",
    "the distribution of the distances of the galaxies in our sample is heavily peaked at 16 mpc due to the virgo cluster and has a standard deviation of 6 mpc .",
    "we derive total magnitudes by 2d integration of our surface brightness profiles .",
    "the distribution of absolute v magnitudes ranges mostly from -19 to -22 with a median value of -20.5 .",
    "kk04 compiles data from several different studies to generate preliminary statistics on how the frequency of pseudobulges varies along the hubble sequence .",
    "they suggest that both pseudobulges and classical bulges exist at intermediate hubble types ( s0 to sbc ) .",
    "there appears to be a transition from classical bulges being more frequent at early types ( s0-sb ) to pseudobulges being more frequent at later types ( sbc - sd ) .",
    "they further suggest that classical bulges will be almost non - existent at hubble types sc and later . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] , we show the distribution of hubble types ( taken from @xcite ) of the galaxies in our sample . to test for differences between pseudobulges and classical bulges",
    "we choose to sample the range of hubble type from s0 to sc .",
    "if we combine this with our choice of evenly sampling driven and undriven galaxies , we expect that our sample should overemphasize pseudobulges .",
    "the distribution of hubble types is as follows : 13 s0 , 2 s0a , 18 sa , 6 sab , 20 sb , 11 sbc , 9 sc .",
    "we will also use 24 e type galaxies from @xcite as early - type sample in some parameter correlations .",
    "we define `` bulges '' photometrically , as excess light over the inward extrapolation of the surface brightness profile of the outer disk .",
    "the region of the galaxy where this excess light dominates the profile is the bulge region .",
    "we classify galaxies as having a pseudobulge by their morphology within this bulge region ; if the bulge is or contains any of the following features : a nuclear bar , a nuclear spiral , and/or a nuclear ring , then the bulge is called a pseudobulge .",
    "conversely , if the bulge better resembles an elliptical galaxy ( relatively featureless isophotes ) , then the bulge is called a classical bulge .",
    "this method is discussed in kk04 .",
    "the existence / absence of visibly identifiable disk - like structure in a bulge correlates with properties of the bulge and the whole galaxy .",
    "the same method is shown to be successful in identifying bulges with higher specific star formation rates @xcite and globally bluer galaxies @xcite .",
    "[ fig : bulgeid ] shows high - resolution _ hst _ images of the bulge region of all galaxies in our sample .",
    "all images are taken in close - to @xmath15 band filters .",
    "note first that classical bulges ( for example ngc  1398 , ngc  2775 , ngc  2880 , and ngc  3115 , all in the rightmost column of the first page of the figure ) have a smooth stellar light profile .",
    "there is no reason evident in the images to think that any of these galaxies harbor a pseudobulge .",
    "the bulges fit the description of e - type galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  4030 shows a face - on nuclear spiral ( bottom row on the second page ) .",
    "the spiral dominates the radial profile for more than a kiloparsec .",
    "ngc  4736 ( fourth page , second row ) also has a nuclear spiral pattern but also has a nuclear bar ; note how the spiral arms seem pinched vertically in the image .",
    "@xcite study this nuclear bar in more detail using dynamical modeling .",
    "ngc  4371 ( third page , middle row ) is an s0 galaxy with at least one nuclear bar .",
    "ngc  3351 ( second page , third row ) has a prominent nuclear ring that heavily distorts the surface brightness profile ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : egprof ] ) ; this nuclear ring is quite well known @xcite . the bulge of ngc  2903 ( first page , bottom row ) shows a chaotic nuclear region ; it appears nearly spiral but is not regular enough over a significant radial range to call it a nuclear spiral .    in this paper",
    "we classify bulges with near-@xmath15-band images ( f547 m , f555w , & f606w ) .",
    "thus our method is subject to the effects of dust obscuration .",
    "however , the structures used to identify pseudobulges are usually experiencing enhanced star formation rates @xcite .",
    "pseudobulges are , therefore , easier to detect in the optical band passes where the mass - to - light ratios are more affected by young stellar populations , rather than in the near infrared where the effects of dust are less pronounced .",
    "it is important to note that classical bulges may have dust in their center , as do many elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , many classical bulges shown in fig .  [ fig : bulgeid ] have some dust lanes in their bulges .",
    "the presence of dust alone is not enough to classify a galaxy as containing a pseudobulge ; instead , it must be of a disk - like nature .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the srsic function provides better fits and more information over two - parameter fitting functions describing surface brightness profiles of bulges and elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , this information comes at the price of more detailed observations .",
    "@xcite shows that replacing an @xmath4-model with a srsic model makes little difference in residuals , unless one has data with high dynamic range in radius .",
    "further , the coupling between parameters in the srsic function can be quite high @xcite . thus again",
    ", it is necessary to fit the decomposition ( eq .  1 ) to large radial range in order to minimize these degeneracies .",
    "for each galaxy we therefore combine multiple data sources together : high - resolution hst imaging in the center , and ground based wide - field images covering the outer disk .",

    "pc2 data has a small field - of - view ( @xmath17  arcsec@xmath18 ) ; thus , it is critical to supplement pc2 data with wide field data .",
    "acs / wfc has proven to be an excellent instrument for obtaining large radial fitting range .",
    "it provides a reasonable sized field - of - view ( @xmath19  arcsec@xmath18 ) at high spatial resolution ( 0.049 arcsec pixel@xmath20 ) .    for as many galaxies as possible we obtain wide field images from the prime - focus - camera on the mcdonald 0.8  m telescope .",
    "this instrument provides a large unvignetted field of view ( @xmath21 arcmin@xmath18 ) , and a single ccd detector .",
    "therefore , we can more accurately carry out sky - subtraction .",
    "these data generally are the deepest .",
    "we also include images from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , 2micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the isaac newton group ( ing ) archive .",
    "individual data sources are noted in table  1 .",
    "all raw data ( mcdonald 0.8  m & ing data ) are bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and illumination corrected .",
    "we subtract the sky background by fitting a plane to a smoothed version of the image where the galaxy and bright stars have been removed .",
    "we calculate johnson @xmath15-band magnitude zero points using the transformations in @xcite for the wfpc2 images and @xcite for the acs images .",
    "sdss g and r profiles are converted to a single v - band profile for each galaxy using the transformations in @xcite .",
    "other profiles are simply shifted to match in surface brightness .",
    "these transformations are derived on galactic disk stars , not galaxies .",
    "further , the calculations require color information .",
    "we use colors from hyper - leda , which refer to colors of the entire galaxies , and the galaxies in our sample most certainly have non - zero color gradients .",
    "therefore the absolute values of surface brightness in this paper are not expected to be consistent to more than 0.3  mag .",
    "however , this does not affect our conclusions which are based the structure in the profiles and not on absolute magnitude .",
    "we check that our total magnitudes are consistent with those published in the rc3 and hyper - leda .",
    "we use the isophote fitting routine of @xcite .",
    "we identify and mask interfering foreground objects in each image .",
    "then we fit ellipses to isophotes by least squares . here , isophotes are sampled by 256 points equally spaced in an angle @xmath22 relating to polar angle by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the polar angle and @xmath25 is the axial ratio .",
    "the software determines six parameters for each ellipse : relative surface brightness , center position , major and minor axis lengths , and position angle along the major axis .",
    "we carry out a bulge - disk decomposition on each galaxy in our sample by fitting eq .  1 to the major axis surface brightness profiles .",
    "our decomposition code is also used by @xcite to fit s0 and e - type galaxies with the disk component `` turned off '' .",
    "the average root - mean - square deviation is @xmath26 mag arcsec@xmath27 .",
    "the largest deviation of any of the data from its fitted profile is @xmath28 mag arcsec@xmath27 .",
    "the parameters determined in bulge - disk decomposition with a srsic model bulge are coupled .",
    "@xcite shows that if the bulge is sufficiently large and the resolution is sufficiently small , initial parameter estimates do not affect the final fit too much . for the most part ,",
    "this is true .",
    "yet , our experience is that initial parameter estimates may still affect the resulting fit . for each galaxy , we begin with a large parameter range that is symmetric about the initial guess",
    ". then we re - fit the galaxy iteratively adjusting the range of allowed parameters to be narrower .",
    "this results in slight changes of best - fit values with lower @xmath29 than without this iteration .",
    "the details of each profile are used to decide the width of available parameter space each parameter is given . typically the available range for @xmath0",
    "is @xmath30 .",
    "the decomposition is carried out on a major axis profile using the mean isophote brightness .",
    "it does not take ellipticity into account during the fitting .",
    "however , these galaxies are known to have varying ellipticity profiles @xcite .",
    "thus , we take the mean ellipticity for each component and adjust the luminosity accordingly : @xmath31 .",
    "the radius of the component is defined as the radius range within which that component dominates the light of the profile .",
    "we also adjust all magnitude dependent quantities ( luminosity and surface brightness ) for galactic reddening according to @xcite .",
    "we use the distances of @xcite .",
    "we do not make any corrections for extinction within the galaxies being studied .",
    "we carry out the bulge - disk decompositions in the @xmath15 band .",
    "this ensures that our results will remain applicable to large surveys commonly done in the optical bands ( e.g.  sdss ) .",
    "however , the radial variation in age and metallicity that exists within galaxies may bias the parameters of bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "@xcite shows that the centers of intermediate type galaxies contain significant structure in @xmath32 color maps , and this variation occurs on scales smaller than the bulge .",
    "thus , there is doubt as to whether the parameters derived on profiles in the middle optical band passes truly reflect the properties of the stellar mass distribution .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate the correlations of colors with srsic parameters . yet , as a check of the stability of structural quantities compared to color gradients , we carry out bulge - disk decompositions on all galaxies in our sample that have archival nicmos images in the filter @xmath33 ( @xmath16 band ) .",
    "we supplement those data with ground - based wide - field data . for this purpose",
    "we use mainly 2mass data and any h - band data available in ned .",

    "note that each bulge has a nuclear excess of light over the inward extrapolation of the fit , and that this nucleus is excluded from the fit ( vertical hatches indicate beginning and end of fit range and excluded data points are marked by open symbols ) .    despite its successes , the srsic bulge plus outer exponential disk model of bulge - disk galaxies does not account for many features of galaxy surface brightness profiles .",
    "disks of intermediate type galaxies commonly have features such as bars , rings , and lenses ( see @xcite for a description of these ) .",
    "further , @xcite shows that many bulges of early and intermediate type galaxies contain nuclei .",

    "these galaxies are not well described by eq .  1 , yet we do our best to decompose as many galaxies as possible .    bars , rings , lenses , and similar features do not conform to the smooth nature of eq .  1",
    ", hence we carefully exclude regions of the profile perturbed by such structures from the fit .",
    "this is a risky procedure , as it requires selectively removing data from a galaxy s profile , and undoubtedly has an effect on the resulting parameters .",
    "we are often helped to identify bars by the structure of the ellipticity profile .",
    "notice the the peak in ellipticity near 50  arcsec in ngc  3351 .",
    "we try to err on the side of removing the fewest points possible . for those galaxies in which a bar is present",
    ", it is our assumption that removing the bar from the fit provides the best estimation of the properties of the underlying bulge and disk .",
    "we test our method by removing a typical number of points from a few galaxies with smooth profiles ( ngc  2841 , ngc  1425 , ngc  4203 , & ngc  1325 ) .",
    "the result is that srsic index can vary as much as @xmath40 , and characteristic radius by @xmath41 .",

    "they can be treated as a group . however , here we have to ask the following question : do thusly identified pseudobulges act as a single class of objects or do significant differences exist among the objects we are identifying as pseudobulges ?",

    "we also note that pseudobulges with @xmath96 are almost all in bulges with nuclear spirals .",
    "it is possible that these bulges are not truly a spiral , instead some other phenomenon , like contamination of the light by the outer disk , is causing us to identify them as pseudobulges .",
    "however , in each parameter the distinction appears to be between classical bulges and the rest of the objects , rather than among the objects we call pseudobulges .",
    "we also show srsic index , ellipticity ratio ( bulge to disk ) , and bulge - to - total ratio as a function of secular driving mechanism .",
    "we separate galaxies as having no driving mechanism , an oval disk , or a bar .",

    "there seems to be little differences in the averages , except ovaled galaxies have smaller srsic index and flatter bulges .",
    "the phenomenon of flat bulges does not appear to require the presence of a bar .",

    "also notice that the distributions of parameters for barred , oval , and normal spirals is roughly the same .",
    "thus it does not seem likely that our method of removing the bar is artificially changing the bulge - disk decomposition parameters .",
    "secular evolution is not the only theory for building bulges that look like disks .",
    "other possibilities such as extremely gas rich accretion events , distant gravitational encounters , or gravitational interactions with a cluster potential could all drive gas to the center of galaxies to increase @xmath3 , as found by @xcite .",

    "the same holds for @xmath3 : there is no substantial difference between pseudobulges in the field versus clustered environments . if pseudobulge formation was driven primarily by tidal encounters with distant galaxies , one would expect that this effect should be enhanced in cluster environments , where such encounters are more frequent .",

    "in fact , it does not seem that on their own pseudobulges would establish any of these correlations , especially @xmath100 .    in all correlations investigated in this work",
    "we find that the fundamental distinction is between classical bulges and pseudobulges .",
    "we do not find significant differences within the class of morphologies we identify as pseudobulges ( nuclear spirals , nuclear bars , nuclear rings , and chaotic nuclear patchiness ) .",
    "is it possible that identifying pseudobulges visually using nuclear morphology is subject to an inherit flaw ?",
    "that being that these systems are by definition bulge - disk systems , and thus is it possible that classical bulges coexist over large radius with the central parts of a disk .",
    "pseudobulges in s0 galaxies exemplify this concern . in many ways elliptical galaxies and s0s",
    "are thought to be the extremes of a continuum of properties .",
    "embedded disks are known to exist in elliptical galaxies ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "would we call such a system where the embedded disk had a nuclear bar a pseudobulge ?",
    "most likely not .",
    "however , in s0s , which by definition have lower @xmath3 , we are inclined to do so . clearly , if there is no sharp change in properties along the e - s0 continuum , there should be some composite systems with secularly formed structure in the disk and a classical ( i.e.  kinematically hot ) bulge .",
    "( note , though , that many s0s resemble defunct later type disk galaxies much more than they do resemble elliptical galaxies as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "this may be the case in ngc  2950 , yet it does not appear to be the rule .",
    "@xcite show that many bulges have more complicated dynamical profiles , with both hot an cold components .",
    "yet , pseudobulges show a remarkable similarity to disk stellar populations , ism , and star formation rates .",
    "these similarities have been shown in the flatness of stellar population gradients @xcite , and the similarity of co profiles to optical light @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that many co gas maps of bulge - disk galaxies have holes in their center , but also many co profiles rise steeply to their center .",
    "a quick comparison of with our sample shows that those holes are found in classical bulges ( e.g.ngc  2841 ) .",
    "@xcite shows that the nuclear morphology of galaxies ( as used here ) predicts the shape of the 3.6 - 8.0 micron color profile : disk - like bulges have flat color profiles , and e - like bulges have holes in 8.0 micron emission .",
    "if we were merely mistakenly identifying disks superimposed on bulges as physically different pseudobulges , we d expect to find larger @xmath3 for such systems as compared to the bulges where we do not see evidence for the presence of a disk which we call classical in this work .",
    "this is because of the added light of the disk onto a fraction of bulges drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "however , we do not find this to be the case .",
    "[ fig : bthist ] shows that pseudobulges are on average smaller than classical bulges .",
    "it is not clear whether pseudobulges participate in the various correlations presented in this paper .",
    "if we look at the pseudobulges alone , they only show a convincing correlation in the kormendy relation ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "their distribution better resembles scatter diagrams in the @xmath85 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 planes .",
    "however , it would seem to be an odd coincidence that in every parameter combination pseudobulges just happen to fall in the right location to extend the correlations set by the classical bulges and the elliptical galaxies .",
    "putting all this together implies that we do not really understand the details of pseudobulge formation very well .",
    "it is also possible that the decomposition of pseudobulges may not be an appropriate procedure .",
    "bulge - disk decomposition assumes that the structures are distinct ( and that light extends to radius of infinity ) . if we accept that pseudobulges are formed through disk phenomena , then such a bulge - disk decomposition may not be an adequate description of those systems . in reality",
    "they might simply be a component of galactic disk .",
    "also , parameters derived from the srsic function are coupled @xcite .",
    "thus , treating pseudobulges in the same way as classical bulges may artificially force them to extend some photometric correlations .    concerning the six bulges with disk - like morphology near their centers that have @xmath96 , two have @xmath103 ( the maximum of classical bulges ) , and ngc  4314 has a very prominent star forming nuclear ring , making this bulge a strong candidate for being a pseudobulge",
    ". this galaxy might be an example for a composite system .",
    "their existence certainly underscores the value of having as much information as possible when diagnosing bulge types .",
    "future work may prove illuminating .",
    "for example , to what extent should we trust bulge morphology as an indicator of secular evolution ?",
    "it is possible for the human eye to mistake merely the presence of dust for spiral structure ?",
    "we also find that the ratio of scale lengths , @xmath42 , in pseudobulges is more tightly correlated and closer to those values reported by other authors ( e.g.  @xcite ) than in classical bulges .",
    "however , the range in values of @xmath42 for classical bulges and pseudobulges are similar ; therefore this does not provide a good diagnostic tool for finding pseudobulges .",
    "pseudobulges extend the parameter correlations of photometric quantities ( @xmath43 , @xmath55 , @xmath86 , and @xmath0 ) .",
    "however in many of these parameters it is unclear if pseudobulges actually show a correlation on their own .",
    "we can compare the structural properties of the bulges in our sample the output of simulation .",
    "unfortunately simulations of galaxies that resemble real galaxies including stars , dark matter , gas and star formation ( and possibly feedback ) are quite difficult .",
    "thus there does not exist a statistically relevant set of simulations for full comparison .",
    "nonetheless , we can compare our results to those that currently exist .",
    "@xcite provides a set of simulations that generate bulges from bar buckling in pure stellar ( no gas ) systems .",
    "the resulting bulges typically have @xmath104 , which is consistent with what we find .",
    "the bulges in our sample tend to be more round than their associated outer disk , and @xcite separate their bulges based on flattening ratios .",
    "so we will only compare to those bulges that are less round than the outer disk .",
    "their simulated galaxies have @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 is bulge - to - disk light ratio ) .",
    "where as our sample has a median @xmath107 with a standard deviation of @xmath108 .",
    "further , they are able to recover the coupling of @xmath43 and @xmath9 that we find in pseudobulges . thus our pseudobulges tend to be a bit smaller .",
    "it may be that bar - buckling is one way to make a pseudobulge , as indicated by the the fact that those simulated bulges from @xcite are contained within the set of pseudobulges , but do not span the whole range in properties .",
    "we reiterate a statement by @xcite , that is also discussed in @xcite , namely that we do not really understand why pseudobulges should have a certain srsic index .",
    "it is understandable that mergers would drive up the srsic index , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , and thus classical bulges are found with higher srsic index .",
    "@xcite simulates minor mergers ( accretion of satellites on the order of the mass of the bulge ) in bulge - disk galaxies .",
    "they show that the srsic index grows as the amount of mass accreted becomes larger .",
    "@xcite takes the study of satellite accretion to lower densities than those simulations of @xcite .",
    "their simulations do not include gas and star formation , and thus as with the @xcite simulations they should be read with that caveat in mind .",
    "they find that low density satellite accretion does not necessarily drive srsic index above the critical value we find(@xmath109 ) .",
    "yet , they also find that satellite accretion leads to a simultaneous increase in @xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : btn ] , we therefore plot the bulge - to - total ratio , @xmath3 , and the ratio of the bulge half - light radius to the scale length of the disk , @xmath42 , against @xmath0 .",
    "there is a tight correlation for classical bulges .",
    "however , pseudobulges do not follow this correlation .",
    "in fact , neither @xmath3 nor @xmath42 correlate with @xmath0 in pseudobulges at all in the range of parameters shown , spanning an order of magnitude in @xmath3 .",
    "the absence of correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath3 in pseudobulges seems to be pointing to a non - merger driven formation scenario for pseudobulges . yet , these results are suggestive at best .",
    "there may be some underlying correlation that is destroyed by other factors ( e.g.  gas fraction or collision parameters ) .",
    "more work is needed from both simulations and observations . that we do not see correlation of @xmath0 and @xmath3 for low - srsic index bulges ( as found in @xcite )",
    "may be indicating that the classical bulges we observe today are the products of multiple mergers , and possibly at higher redshifts there is a population of low - srsic index classical bulges .",
    "conversely it is entirely possible that a population of small classical bulges exists , yet they are embedded within pseudobulges . in this case",
    "the mass of a bulge , and hence the @xmath3 within a specific galaxy would be coming from multiple mechanisms .",
    "if pseudobulges are built by secular evolution , the simplest mechanism controlling the srsic index in bulges is that @xmath0 grows with time as the bulge - to - total ratio increases .",
    "however , as discussed above , it appears that there is not a strong connection between @xmath3 and srsic index .",
    "this would imply that srsic index in pseudobulges is not a time - dependent quantity .",
    "we wish to emphasize , though , that the error in the measurement of @xmath0 is large , and might be masking an underlying weak correlation .",
    "also , by focusing on intermediate - type galaxies , where both pseudobulges and classical bulges occur , we miss very low @xmath3 systems .",
    "expanding a sample to later types might reveal a weak correlation @xcite . since @xmath43 correlates tightly with @xmath9 for pseudobulges",
    ", it is no surprise that @xmath42 does not correlate with @xmath0 in pseudobulges .",
    "the linear coupling of @xmath43 and @xmath9 is well established in late type galaxies @xcite .",
    "it may be that the srsic index of pseudobulges is merely another manifestation of the dynamical state of the system .",
    "stars in bulges with larger amounts of random motion often take on radial orbits , thus climbing higher out of the potential well .",
    "thus there is more light at large radius , increasing @xmath0 .",
    "however , stars in orbits with higher amounts of angular momentum would be less likely to take on radial orbits and thus bulge light would contribute less at large radius ; driving @xmath0 down .",
    "the observation that the distribution of srsic indices in bulges of galaxies from e to sc is bimodal then strengthens the claim that what we are calling pseudobulges are not merely the low - mass counterparts of the same phenomena that form classical bulges and elliptical galaxies .",
    "this description fits well with the theory that secular evolution forms pseudobulges , and mergers , whether by a single event or succession of events , form classical bulges .",
    "the higher angular momentum ( and thus low srsic index ) systems have not had major mergers and thus have not experienced the violent processes that lower the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion .",
    "what is left unknown is why pseudobulges are not exponential , and also what keeps them from having larger srsic indices .",
    "we conclude by returning to the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : bthist ] , and the implications of the range of @xmath3 for pseudobulges .",
    "it is now well known that the presence of many low-@xmath3 systems presents a problem for current @xmath110cdm galaxy formation theories @xcite . in our sample",
    "we find no classical bulge galaxies with @xmath111 .",
    "recent studies which compare merger histories in @xmath110cdm simulations to the observed frequency of bulgeless galaxies suggest that either there are too many mergers in the simulations , or that disks must be much more robust to the merging process than previously thought @xcite .",
    "pseudobulges span a range of @xmath3 from 0.35 to zero .",
    "if pseudobulges form through internal - disk processes then a galaxy with a pseudobulge can be thought of as a pure disk galaxy .",
    "thus current estimates of the number of low-@xmath3 systems could only be thought of as lower - limits ; the existence of pseudobulges would make the problem of forming bulgeless systems even more pressing .",
