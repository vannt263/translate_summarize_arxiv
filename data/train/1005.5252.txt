    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are believed to be powered by an accreting supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in the center of a galaxy , a significant fraction of agn show powerful jets , supersonic relativistic flows , on small ( sub parsec ) and large ( multi hundred kpc ) scales .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these agn are characterized by nonthermal emission extending from radio to high energy gamma - rays .",
    "this radiation comes from an accretion disc and from two relativistic jets that are launched close to the smbh in two opposite directions .",
    "the emission associated to the accretion process can be generated by thermal plasma in the form of an optically - thick disc under efficient cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or as an optically - thin corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the emission from the jets is non thermal and comes from a population of relativistic particles accelerated for instance in strong shocks , although other scenarios are possible as well ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this non - thermal emission is thought to be produced through synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although hadronic models have been also considered in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of a stellar clustering in the central regions of agn , possibly down to very small distances from the central smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implies that the interaction between a star and the jet should eventually happen .",
    "the gamma - ray production due to the interaction between an obstacle and an agn jet has been studied in a number of works .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggested the high - energy radiation produced by a beam of relativistic protons impacting with a cloud of the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "the gamma - ray emission from one or many clouds from the blr interacting with a hydrodynamical jet recently has bin analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the radiation from the interaction between a massive star and an agn jet was studied in @xcite .",
    "namely they suggested that the jet interacts with stellar winds of massive stars , in their model they assume that the source of gamma - rays is moving with a relativistic speed , therefore the radiation is doppler boosted .",
    "the main radiation mechanism in this scenario is related to the development of the pair cascade in the field of the radiation of the massive star .    in this work , we study the interaction of a red giant ( rg ) star with the base of the jet in agn and their observable consequences in gamma rays .",
    "we focus here on the case of m87 , a nearby non - blazar agn that presents very high - energy recurrent activity with variability timescales of few days @xcite . in the framework presented here ,",
    "the jet impacts the rg envelope , already partially tidaly disrupted by the gravitational field of the central smbh .",
    "the rg envelope is blown up , forming a cloud of gas accelerated and heated by jet pressure .",
    "the jet base is likely strongly magnetized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the jet flow affected by the impact with the rg envelope can be a suitable region for particle acceleration , and a significant fraction of the involved magnetic and kinetic energy of the jet can be transferred to protons and electrons . although electrons may not able to reach tev emitting energies because of the expected large magnetic fields , protons would not suffer from this constraint .",
    "these protons could reach the star blown material , and optically - thick proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) interactions could lead to significant gamma - ray production in the early stages of the cloud expansion .",
    "unlike in @xcite , we deal with solar - mass - type stars instead of the more rare high - mass stars , study the rg atmosphere - jet interaction , and follow the hydrodynamical evolution of the cloud .",
    "finally , we do not introduce any beaming factor to the radiation , since in our scenario most of the emission is produced when the cloud has not been significantly accelerated , doppler boosting being therefore negligible .",
    "main sequence stars are too compact to be significantly affected by tidal forces from the smbh , unlike rgs , whose external layers are far less gravitationally bounded to the stellar core . therefore , in the vicinity of a smbh , the external layers of an rg will suffer significant tidal disruption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can unbound from the stellar core a cloud with significant mass @xmath2  g. therefore , if an rg penetrates into the innermost region of the jet , the rg envelope can be already weakly gravitationally attached to the star due to tidal disruption .",
    "in this situation , the external layers of the star can be lost due to jet ablation , which is unlikely in the case of undisrupted rgs ( except for very powerful jets ) .",
    "the tidal forces are important when the distance between the smbh and the star is similar to or smaller than the tidal distance ( @xmath3 ) for a given rg radius ( @xmath4 ) and mass ( @xmath5 )    , where : @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the mass of the smbh .",
    "therefore , for a given rg - jet interaction distance to the smbh @xmath8 , the rg can lose the atmosphere layers beyond @xmath9 .",
    "for the case of m87 , with @xmath10 @xcite , one obtains : @xmath11 where @xmath12 . since a solar - mass rg , the most common one ,",
    "can have up to few hundreds of @xmath13 , a significant fraction of the star envelope can be carried away by the jet flow up to @xmath14  cm .",
    "note that evidence for the presence of a radio jet has been found from m87 within a distance of @xmath15  cm from the smbh @xcite .",
    "the m87 tev lightcurve obtained by @xcite shows several peaks , and each of these peaks in our model correspond to different rg - jet events .",
    "note however that some nearby peaks may correspond to a complex disruption process , motivated for instance by a very disrupted and massive envelope , or by jet inhomogeneities .",
    "also , it can not be discarded that a cluster of several rgs could also enter the jet .",
    "the time needed by the rg to cross the jet can not be shorter than the typical m87 event duration , @xmath16  s. it can not be longer either , since then the event duration would also be longer if there is available rg matter for removal , as expected at @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 , and the interaction height can be derived taking the velocity of the rg orbiting the smbh as the keplerian velocity : @xmath19^{1/3 } \\approx   10^{16 } \\theta_{-1}^{-2/3}\\mbox{cm } , \\label{rjct}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the jet semi - opening angle in radians .",
    "an important parameter is the power of the jet @xmath21 erg s@xmath22 @xcite , which we fix to @xmath23 erg s@xmath22 . from @xmath24 and the jet width , @xmath25",
    ", we can derive the jet energy flux at the interaction height : @xmath26    there are two regimes for the rg tidal disruption : under strong tidal interaction ( @xmath27 ) , the rg envelope suffers an elongation along the direction of motion of the star @xcite ; under weak tidal interaction ( @xmath28 ) , the envelope is still roughly spherical @xcite . in both situations ,",
    "the outer layers of the star will be swept away by the jet , forming a cloud that will quickly heat up and expand .",
    "we study the time evolution of the cloud adopting a very simplified hydrodynamical model for the cloud expansion .",
    "the heating of the cloud is caused by the propagation of shock waves , which are formed by the pressure exerted by the jet from below .",
    "therefore , the cloud pressure is taken similar to the jet pressure ( regardless it is of kinetic or magnetic nature ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the speed of light , and @xmath31 the adiabatic index ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the cloud expands at its sound speed ( @xmath33 ) , since the lateral and top external pressures are much smaller than the jet bottom one .",
    "when the cloud has significantly expanded , its pressure becomes smaller than the jet pressure from below . at that point",
    "new shocks leading to further cloud heating .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ clouds ] , for the simplest case of weak disruption , how the spherical cloud evolves under the effect of jet pressure as seen in the plane perpendicular to the jet axis .      the system of equations that characterizes the weak tidal interaction case can be written as follows : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the cloud radius and mass , respectively .    the solutions to eqs .",

    "after @xmath58 , @xmath63 yields a slower increase of @xmath37 with @xmath64 , although this should be still a fast exponential growth .",
    "we consider @xmath65 since we focus here on the case when the cloud is optically thick to @xmath1 collisions ( see below ) , and at @xmath66 the cloud density is already too low .       in the case of strong tidal interaction the rg atmosphere is stretched in the direction of motion of the star , and the expansion will be now cylindric .",
    "in such a case , @xmath67 ( @xmath37 is the cloud cylindrical radius ) can be significantly smaller than the length of the disrupted atmosphere , @xmath68 @xcite .",

    ", electron energies will be too low to explain the hess spectrum of m87 up to energies of few 10  tev @xcite , whereas protons may be accelerated up to ultra - high energies .",
    "in addition , the expected @xmath92-values could easily suppress any ic component .",
    "we note that even for diffusion faster than bohm , or under bigger @xmath82-values , protons could still reach enough energy to explain observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the cloud density can be high , making of @xmath1 interactions the best candidate for gamma - ray production in the rg - jet scenario , the characteristic cooling time for @xmath1 collisions being : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the cloud density .",
    "we note that the high cloud density should not affect significantly the proton acceleration , which would occur in the far less dense jet shocked region .",
    "nevertheless , protons should penetrate in the acceleration process and , in the blanford - znajek scenario of jet formation @xcite the jet is probably formed only by pairs at @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , some cloud material should penetrate into the shocked jet medium , which can occur through rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ prot_acc ] a sketch of the mixing , proton acceleration and gamma - ray production processes .",
    "we do not specify here the physics of particle acceleration , although this could take place by one or a combination of different mechanisms : magnetic reconnection right after the shock in the jet , shear acceleration due to the strong velocity gradients close to the contact discontinuity , or some sort of stochastic acceleration due to magnetic turbulence downstream the jet shock .",
    "regarding other proton radiation mechanisms , proton synchrotron will not be efficient in our case , with @xmath95 .",
    "also photomeson production can be also neglected , since @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 would be the luminosity produced in the region and the ambient photon energy ( e.g. thermal x - rays ; see below ) , respectively .",
    "photomeson production with kev ambient photons would require protons with energies above @xmath99  tev    hereafter , we will treat the generation of protons with energies @xmath100  gev phenomenologically , assuming that a fraction @xmath101 of the total eclipsed jet luminosity is converted to relativistic protons : @xmath102 .",
    "we also assume that these protons can effectively reach the cloud , where they suffer @xmath1 interactions that lead to @xmath103-meson production , although some of them could escape surrounding the cloud .",
    "once in the cloud , protons can be effectively trapped during the rg - jet interaction time for magnetic fields as low as few g , since : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the time inside the cloud .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ bb ] ) has been derived assuming bohm diffusion , but faster diffusion regimes would still allow to keep protons trapped in the cloud .",
    "the typical fraction of the proton energy transferred per collision to the leading gamma rays is @xmath106 @xcite in the optically thin case , and around twice that value for optically thick media neglecting gamma - rays from other secondary particles .",

    "we remark that , if a detectable gamma - ray flare with a duration of few days were to be produced in m87 , in particular through @xmath1 interactions , the cloud should have a mass of @xmath181  g. such a massive cloud can not acquire a large speed in the jet direction at the times when @xmath1 collisions are an efficient gamma - ray emitting mechanism , and therefore the emission will not suffer significant doppler boosting . in the case of a lighter cloud",
    ", large lorentz factors can be achieved , but then @xmath1 interactions will be inefficient producing gamma - rays , the probability to detect a flare lower due to beaming , and the duration of the event shorter than observed because of faster expansion and beaming .",
    "coming back to the question of cloud mass , we note that to extract a cloud with a mass @xmath182 g , a more powerful jet than in m87 , for similar jet - rg interaction conditions , would be required ( see eq.([mb ] ) ) .",
    "an important question is whether there are enough rgs in m87 at the relevant jet scales .",
    "the model presented here would require few interactions per year to explain the observations in m87 .",

    "the stellar mass in a sphere with a radius of 80  pc is estimated in @xmath187 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these observational data should be extrapolated four orders of magnitude down to @xmath188  pc .",
    "thus , depending on the assumed extrapolation law , the number of rgs in the vicinity of the smbh may or may not be enough .",
    "it is worth noting that a dense stellar cluster near the smbh could be behind the broad - line region in agn as produced by the blown - up atmosphere of red dwarfs , which would imply the presence of numerous rgs in the center of agn @xcite .",
    "in addition , studies of the possible stellar density profiles in the vicinity of the smbh in agn @xcite show that densities like the required one ( @xmath189  pc@xmath186 ) could be achieved .",
    "the observation of vhe flares could be already an indication that enough rgs are present near the smbh in m87 .",
    "interestingly , rg / jet interactions are expected to be transient phenomena . at higher jet heights , although many rgs could be simultaneously present in the jet rendering rather continuous emission , the much more diluted jet would not remove a significant amount of material from the star and the effective cross section of the interaction would be just @xmath4 , yielding a low energy budget for such a multiple interaction events .",
    "the scenario presented here , adopted to explain the day vhe flares observed from m87 , could also be relevant in other non - blazar agn .",
    "for blazar sources the beamed emission would overcome the rg - jet interaction , expected to be weakly beamed due to moderate @xmath190-values .",
    "for instance , the closest agn , the radio galaxy cen  a , at @xmath191  mpc distance @xcite , could also show detectable flare like emission . at present",

    "[ etj ] a jet luminosity @xmath195 , a rather modest value .",
    "therefore , it can not be excluded that rg - jet interactions may contribute to the vhe radiation detected from cen  a , or that transient activity due to rg - jet interactions may be observed from this source .",
    "another case , the radio galaxy ngc1275 , at a distance of 73  mpc @xcite , shows variable behaviour in gev @xcite .",
    "the gev luminosity is of about @xmath196  erg  s@xmath22 .",

    "( [ etj ] ) , we can estimate the power of the jet as @xmath197  erg  s@xmath22 adopting an @xmath198 . in the case of ngc  1275",
    "the shocked cloud would be optically thick at the luminosity peak , implying significant attenuation of the tev emission through photon - photon absorption with a cutoff around 50  gev .    at farther distances ,",
    "the strong jet luminosity dependence @xmath199 implies that fr  ii sources with say @xmath200  erg  s@xmath22 may be still detectable up to distances of @xmath201  gpc ( internal absorption should be included in these cases ; see @xcite ) . also , the luminosity in the range 0.1100  gev would also be significant unless there is a strong low - energy cutoff in the proton spectrum .",
    "therefore , fermi may detect day - long gev flares originated due to rg - jet interactions from fr  ii galaxies up to distances of few 100  mpc .",
    "summarizing , gev and tev instrumentation can potentially detect a number of rg - jet interactions per year taking place in nearby fr  ii and very nearby fr  i galaxies , with the most powerful events being detectable up to 1  gpc .",

    "<S> since the produced radiation would be unbeamed , such an events should be mostly detected from non - blazar agn . </S>",
    "<S> they may be frequent phenomena , detectable in the gev - tev range even up to distances of @xmath0  gpc for the most powerful jets . </S>",
    "<S> the counterparts at lower energies are expected to be not too bright . </S>",
    "<S> m87 , and nearby non - blazar agn in general , can be fast variable sources of gamma - rays through red giant / jet interactions . </S>"
