    "neutrinos emitted from the early phase of core collapse that precedes a type ii / ib / ic sn explosion , are emitted mainly due to e@xmath1-captures on free protons and heavy nuclei ( in the f - p shell with @xmath2 ) .",
    "up to core densities of @xmath3 3 @xmath4 gm / cc ( neutrino trapping density ) these @xmath5 escape freely from the overlying stellar matter without any interaction that change their energy .",
    "their spectroscopy by terrestrial detectors would yield important information on the physical and the nuclear configuration of the collapsing stellar core .",
    "the total number of neutrinos emitted from a 1.4 @xmath6 stellar core as it evolves from a initial density of @xmath7 to a neutrino - trapping density of @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the charge - current reaction @xmath10 on deuterium nuclei in the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) d@xmath11o detector and the @xmath12 scattering reaction for the more massive super kamioka ( h@xmath11o based ) detector can facilitate the detection of a significant number of these neutrinos at 1 kpc ( burrows 1990 ) .    the neutrino production rate ( i.e. the spectrum of the emitted @xmath5 ) as a function of neutrino energy @xmath13 depends on the electron capture rate for heavy nuclei ( @xmath14 ) and free protons ( @xmath15 ) which are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the coulomb correction factor ( taken to be @xmath18 for heavy nuclei and @xmath19 for free protons , fuller , 1982 ) and the ft s are related to the nuclear transition matrix element .",
    "fig 1(a ) presents the incident cumulative spectra of @xmath5 emitted up to a density of @xmath20 , from a supernova explosion 1 kpc away .",
    "these calculations are done using a single zone approximation for the collapsing stellar core ( ray et al . , 1984 ) , and approximating the ensemble of neutron - rich heavy nuclei present in the core by a mean nucleus a ( which is the most abundant nucleus present under the given thermodynamic core configuration  bethe et al . 1979 ) .",
    "the spectra for free proton has been weighted by the relative fraction of free protons @xmath21 present in the core .",
    "@xmath22 is the e@xmath1- capture q - value for free - protons and heavy nuclei respectively and q@xmath23 is given as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the difference in the neutron and proton chemical potentials and @xmath27 is the energy of the gamow - teller giant resonance centroid ( the centroids in fp - shell nuclei , found from experimental data from ( n , p ) reactions have been used for characterizing gt centroids in fp - shell nuclei ( sutaria and ray , 1995 ) and are close to 3 mev as used here ) . for free protons",
    "this reduces to @xmath28",
    ".    1 true cm    .pre - trapping neutrino detections in sno and super kamioka with hardness ratios up to @xmath29 = 24.16 for indicated heavy nuclear e - capture matrix elements for 15 m@xmath30 fuller ( 1982 ) and 25 m@xmath30 weaver et al ( 1985 ) pre supernova stars . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     fig.1(b ) and fig.1(c ) show the expected @xmath5 spectra in sno and super kamioka detectors respectively and are obtained by folding the spectra in fig 1(a ) with the energy dependent detection cross - sections quoted in burrows ( 1990 ) and sehgal ( 1974 ) .",
    "table 1 displays the total number of neutrinos which can be expected to be detected in the sno and super - kamioka detectors .",
    "the neutrino production rate depends on the e@xmath1-capture rate , and hence on the weak interaction strength ( @xmath31 ) of the nuclei undergoing @xmath32-capture .",
    "the numbers in table 1 have been calculated for two different values of @xmath33 .",
    "nuclei beyond @xmath34ge become neutron shell - blocked against e@xmath1-capture ( fuller 1982 ) , and since capture can proceed only via either thermally excited shell unblocking or via forbidden transitions , the @xmath32-capture strength drops to @xmath35 for neutron shell blocked nuclei ( kar and ray 1983 ) .",
    "the neutrino spectrum depends on the abundances of nuclei undergoing electron capture , and this in turn is determined by the nuclear properties specifically , the electron capture q - values @xmath22 and the nuclear chemical potentials @xmath36 and @xmath25 . at the stage of collapse considered , the ambient temperature @xmath37 is typically less than about 1 mev , and in this range of temperatures , the nuclei undergo transition from a region where shell and pairing affects dominate to the region where the nucleus can be well approximated by the liquid drop model . to take into account the shell and pairing effects in the early stage of collapse",
    ", we have used the relativistic mean field theory ( see e.g. , sheikh at al . 1993 ) to calculate @xmath36 and @xmath25 for a number of nuclei ranging from @xmath38mn to @xmath34ge ( sutaria et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in fig .",
    "2(a ) we present the calculation of @xmath36 for isotopes of ni in the ground state which are expected to have significant abundance in this early stage of stellar collapse .",
    "2(b ) presents the values of @xmath25 for the same set of nuclei .",
    "earlier workers ( baron et al . 1985 , cooperstein , 1985 ) had developed nuclear equations of state which were based on the liquid drop model of the nucleus , with corrections for nuclear compressibility etc . in these models ,",
    "the nuclear energy per nucleon @xmath39 is a function of the nuclear density @xmath40 , the nuclear volume @xmath41 , the proton fraction @xmath42 and the ratio @xmath43 corresponding to stellar packing fraction .",
    "the chemical potentials of the neutrons and protons in equilibrium with nuclei under given thermodynamic conditions have been calculated in bck code by the usual methods ( see e.g. bethe et al . , 1979 and references therein ) .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath36 and @xmath25 from the bck equation of state with the rmf computations is displayed in figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) . in these figures ,",
    "we have used outputs of bck code at low temperature limit ( @xmath44 mev ) corresponding to the nuclear parameters : @xmath45 , s@xmath46 ( volume symmetry energy ) = 30.34 , and the nuclear compressibility factor k@xmath47 = 180.0 mev .",
    "properties of ni and other neutron rich nuclei in the fp - shell , such as binding energies , nuclear deformations etc , computed from the rmf code were discussed in relation to phenomenological nuclear models by sutaria et al ( 1997 ) .",
