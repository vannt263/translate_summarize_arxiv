    "the emergence of anisotropy in rotating flows has been studied extensively since the seminal work of taylor and proudman @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been observed both experimentally @xcite and numerically @xcite for the velocity field , as well as for passive scalar fluctuations using a reduced model @xcite and direct numerical simulations ( dns ) @xcite .",
    "while linear theory like the _ taylor - proudman _ theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) explains the existence of the columnar structures in the laminar regime , more recent theories account for the nonlinearities in the flow and shed light on the mechanism of two dimensionalization of the flow from an initial isotropic state @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of such flows is the transfer of energy to large scales on application of external forcing @xcite .",
    "however , there has been little consensus about the scaling of the energy spectrum at large scales .",
    "the numerical simulation of @xcite reports a steep @xmath3 spectrum whereas @xcite show a more conventional @xmath2 scaling that is reminiscent of two - dimensional ( 2d ) kolmogorov - kraichnan - batchelor - leith ( kkbl ) phenomenology for an inverse cascade of energy @xcite ( also see @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "a model is used to show that a @xmath2 spectrum for the 2d modes ( also called `` slow modes '' ) results when triadic interactions between the 2d and the 3d ( `` fast '' ) modes are discounted for artificially , but a @xmath3 spectrum is observed when all interactions are accounted for .",
    "besides , a @xmath3 law for the horizontal kinetic energy spectra is also observed in a rapidly rotating rayleigh - bnard convection using a reduced model @xcite . it must be pointed out that the conserved quantities ( for an inviscid fluid ) in the case of two dimensional flows , viz . , energy and enstrophy ,",
    "are different from the three dimensional case , where energy and helicity ( the correlation between velocity and vorticity ) are conserved .",
    "therefore , the physical mechanism leading to an inverse cascade of energy in the three dimensional case does not follow immediately from its two dimensional counterpart .",
    "besides , the nature of forcing , i.e. spectrally isotropic vs.  anisotropic ( equivalently 3d vs.  2d ) , with three or two spatial components ( 3c vs.  2c ) , and the aspect ratio of the computational box may play significant roles in the dynamics of the flow .    in this paper , we revisit the issue of inverse cascade of energy in rotating flows within a specific framework , viz . , fixed rossby number and unit aspect ratio of the computational box .",
    "however , we explore different forcing functions to consider the effects of spectral anisotropy and of helicity in the inverse cascade range .",
    "we present results from numerical simulations that use a subgrid scale model developed in @xcite ; this model was validated against dns of rotating flows in @xcite .",
    "we show that the two observed spectra , viz . , @xmath2 and @xmath3 can arise in full simulations ( simulations that resolve all triadic interactions and account for coupling between the 2d and the 3d modes ) .",
    "when the forcing is isotropic , energy goes from the 3d to the 2d modes and a @xmath6 spectrum results for the energy in the slow modes .",
    "when more energy is pumped into the 2d modes , less energy goes from the 3d to the 2d modes and a @xmath2 spectrum is seen for the slow modes .",
    "the kinematics of the nonlinear advection term also changes significantly as the spectra of slow modes change from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "we study the velocity gradient tensor in all simulations and compute the largest eigenvalue of the rate of strain tensor .",
    "for the case of anisotropic forcing when the flux of energy between the 3d and the 2d modes reverses and energy at large scales goes from the 2d to the 3d modes , a significant amount of shear is created at large scales .",
    "this introduces a new _ shear timescale _",
    "@xmath4 that is independent of wavenumber . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum for the total energy approaches a @xmath5 power law .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : results ] we present and discuss the numerical results , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we conclude with brief remarks and pointers to some open questions .",
    "the non - dimensionalized incompressible navier - stokes equations with global rotation , @xmath7 , are as follows :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the instantaneous velocity field , @xmath10 is the pressure term , @xmath11 is an external force per unit of mass , the rossby number is @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively normalized velocity and length scales taken to be unity ) and the reynolds number is @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the kinematic viscosity ) .    the forcing term @xmath11 is introduced in the navier - stokes equation to study the inverse cascade of energy . in the simulations presented in this paper ,",
    "besides @xmath17 and @xmath18 defined at characteristic length scales , we will be interested primarily in the reynolds and rossby numbers based on the forcing scale @xmath0 , at which the external force is applied .",
    "the latter quantities are defined as follows : @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the r.m.s .",
    "velocity before the inverse cascade is initiated ( or equivalently , the r.m.s .",
    "velocity at the forcing scale at any time during the simulation ) in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the time - scale associated with forcing wavenumber is defined as , @xmath22      the linear , inviscid approximation of eq .   in the absence of forcing",
    "has wave solutions called inertial waves @xcite . in the language of theory , the inviscid version of eq .",
    "can be re - written as @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes complex conjugate , @xmath25 is the modal transfer coefficient , and @xmath18 is assumed to be small and therefore represents rapid rotation ( hence weak nonlinearity ) .",
    "note that eq .",
    "is not closed and , hence , any practical solution can be realized based on an equivalent closed set of equations ( see e.g. @xcite for a thorough discussion on closed models ) .",
    "furthermore , the _ craya - herring _ helical basis @xmath26 @xcite has been used in deriving eq .   with the canonical basis corresponding to a given wavevector @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the amplitude @xmath30 of @xmath9 is associated with the helical wave with a dispersion relation for the wave frequency : @xmath31 .",
    "each wave vector is associated with two waves of opposite polarization , @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , @xmath33 implies a flow restricted to a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) .",
    "hence , 2d modes are also known as _",
    "slow _ modes . in other words ,",
    "2d modes correspond to vortical motions with no fast wave modulation .",
    "the mechanism of transfer of energy towards two dimensional modes that is responsible for the formation of taylor columns is based on near resonant condition of the interacting triads @xcite : @xmath35 however , the problem with wave turbulence theory is that it is not valid for too small values of @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , the predicted energy transfer is zero for @xmath34 @xcite because 2d and 3d modes are decoupled in such theories at lowest order .",
    "similar analysis is presented using two - point closures of turbulence , such as the eddy damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) closure developed earlier in the context of rotating flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "even a sophisticated asymptotic quasi - normal markovian theory , built on the edqnm closure @xcite , does not deal with @xmath34 .",
    "thus , while the gradual concentration of energy in close proximity of the slow manifold can be theoretically justified to explain numerical and experimental observations , the exact coupling between the slow manifold and the 3d modes leading to a transfer of energy from 3d to 2d modes still remains an unresolved problem .",
    "the inverse cascade of energy , that will be further elaborated upon in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , presumably happens in this slow manifold .",
    "an alternative theory on the egression of columnar structures is given by @xcite ; it is based on the conservation of linear momentum @xmath37 and of angular momentum @xmath38 in the axial direction ( within a cylinder of radius @xmath39 ) , resulting in a relative concentration of the kinetic energy density within this cylinder where it disperses to form columnar clouds .",
    "this holds in the linear time scale @xmath40 , when the non - linear term is small and hence can be neglected in comparison with the coriolis term ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , the percentage of total energy contained within the cylinder falls as @xmath42 , so the columns eventually become weak , although the energy density remains higher within the cylinder than outside .",
    "the time scale associated with this process , @xmath43 , will be relevant for the analysis of the inverse cascade regime in the following sections .",
    "lewis fry richardson s famous couplet , _ big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity , and little whirls have lesser whirls and so on to viscosity _  is the antithesis of observations made by experimentalists @xcite and analysts @xcite in the context of rotating turbulence .",
    "the notion of inverse cascade of energy to large scales is well known in 2d turbulence @xcite ( also see e.g. , @xcite ) and may be justified in simple terms on the basis of _ fjrtoft s _ theorem due to the conservation of quadratic invariants ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "nonlinear triadic interactions conserve both the energy and the enstrophy , @xmath44 , and as the latter is advected towards smaller scales , a fraction of the energy cascades towards larger scales to maintain the balance in each triad . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the justification for an inverse cascade of energy in three - dimensional rotating turbulence is not so straightforward since the conservation laws change in three dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , a similar argument could be made in the case of three dimensional flows based on helicity and the possibility of an inverse cascade of energy may be alluded to , as has been explained in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been argued in @xcite that interactions between three helical modes of the same polarization @xmath45 , will lead to an inverse energy cascade for the same reason as has been postulated by kraichnan @xcite and _ fjrtoft _ in the two dimensional case .",
    "numerical simulations of three dimensional flows , where the non - linear interactions have been restricted to identically polarized wave numbers in all triads , further corroborate the aforementioned argument @xcite .",
    "in the previous subsection we have summarized theories that clearly vindicate the notion of a gradual transfer of energy towards the slow manifold , without being able to formally account for the exact coupling between the 3d and the 2d modes . however",
    ", once the energy is in the 2d modes and if the coupling between the 2d and the 3d modes is weak , one can naively expect an inverse cascade to develop as in the case of 2d turbulence .",
    "the strength of the coupling between the 2d and the 3d modes has been studied by @xcite and also by @xcite using numerical simulations . in the case of infinitely small @xmath18 and in a periodic box ,",
    "the 2d modes are expected to decouple from the 3d modes and evolve under their own dynamics .",
    "this is in agreement with the evidence of decoupling between the 2d and the 3d modes that was observed in numerical simulations of freely decaying rotating turbulence @xcite and of ideal helical rotating flows @xcite .",
    "however , note that some authors claim that these modes never decouple in infinite domains @xcite .",
    "the decoupling is further illustrated below based on the presentation in @xcite and extended to consider the flux of energy interchanged between the 2d and the 3d modes .",
    "it is important to note that refs .",
    "@xcite studied rotating flows in the absence of forcing , thereby making a case for analyzing a completely decoupled set of equations for the 2d and the 3d modes ; however , ref .",
    "@xcite considers the effect of forcing .",
    "we write wavenumbers in three - dimensional fourier space using cylindrical coordinates , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we denote the 2d modes in fourier space as @xmath50 , and the 3d or wave modes as @xmath51 .",
    "following @xcite , wave vectors are decomposed as follows : @xmath52 then the velocity field @xmath53 can be decomposed as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "likewise , the total energy @xmath56 may be written in terms of the modal components as @xmath57 , where @xmath58/2 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "multiplying the spectral form of eq .   by @xmath61 and integrating over all wavenumbers in @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , results in two differential equations for the total energy in the wave and the slow modes as follows : @xmath64 where the @xmath65 and @xmath66 terms refer to the corresponding components of the forced energy injection , and 3d ( 2d ) refers to @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , as stated before . equations and are congruous to the equations derived in @xcite .",
    "when positive , the term @xmath69 refers to the 3d energy that is transferred to small scales and dissipated per unit of time ( thus balancing the @xmath65 term ) and results from triadic interactions that move energy from the 3d modes to the 3d modes ( resonant interactions involving three fast modes or those between two fast modes and one slow mode ) .",
    "similarly , the term @xmath70 results from all triadic interactions that move energy from the 2d modes to the 2d modes and , when positive , it s net effect is to balance the injection of energy per unit time in the 2d modes .",
    "finally , @xmath71 is the flux of energy across @xmath72 in fourier space , i.e. , energy going from the 2d to the 3d modes when @xmath73 .",
    "this term is expected to be @xmath74 @xcite , and as a result , in the limit of zero @xmath18 , the slow manifold decouples from the wave modes and the energy equations and are as follows : @xmath75 it may be emphasized that , in this limit , @xmath70 only involves triadic interactions between slow modes and @xmath69 involves interactions between fast modes .",
    "moreover , the equation for the evolution of the 2d energy further decouples into equations for @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we integrate the navier - stokes eq .   in a rotating frame of reference using a parallel pseudo - spectral code with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "a second order runge - kutta method is used to evolve the equations in time and no dealiasing is done because a les is used ; so the maximum resolved wavenumber is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the linear resolution .",
    "as large scale separation between the box size and the forcing scale is essential to study inverse cascades with reasonably large values of the reynolds number , we use large eddy simulations ( les ) .",
    "the sub - grid scale model is such that the wavenumbers below a cut - off wavenumber , @xmath80 , are resolved explicitly whereas larger wavenumbers are modeled based on energy and helicity contributions to the eddy viscosity and the eddy noise terms in the edqnm equations . for completeness , the model is summarized below .",
    "first , the larger resolved scales are computed by integrating the following equation : @xmath81       { \\bf u}_{\\alpha}({\\bf k},t ) & = t^{<}_{\\alpha}({\\bf k},t ) \\nonumber \\\\   { } & & - \\frac{1}{{\\mathcal r}o } p_{\\alpha\\beta } \\ , \\varepsilon_{\\beta\\gamma\\zeta}{\\bf u}_{\\zeta}({\\bf k},t )      + { \\bf f}_{\\alpha}({\\bf k},t ) , \\label{modelres}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is basically the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( barring the newly introduced subgrid model term , @xmath82 ) . here",
    "the greek subindices denote cartesian components of the vectors and tensors and einstein summation convention is assumed .",
    "the term @xmath83 is the fourier transform of the nonlinear term in eq .   over all modes with @xmath84 . in other words",
    ", it represents the nonlinear transfer that arises from the convolution sum over a truncated triadic domain , @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "this term is computed using the pseudo - spectral method .",
    "the eddy viscosity term , @xmath82 is associated with the subgrid model and is computed based on parameters that are modeled from the unresolved scales .",
    "@xmath87 is the projector operator on the solenoidal velocity field and @xmath88 is the antisymmetric tensor associated with the curl operator ( levi - civita symbol ) .",
    "the isotropic energy spectrum @xmath89 and the helicity spectrum @xmath90 up to wavenumber @xmath91 ( including unresolved scales ) are then obtained through data fitting and extrapolation from the resolved scales .",
    "next , the isotropic energy spectrum @xmath89 for the unresolved scales is evolved based on the following : @xmath92 an equivalent balance equation for the unresolved helicity spectrum @xmath90 is solved if the helicity of the flow is non - zero ( note : when @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath95 are terms prescribed by the model as before , @xmath96 represents the energy transferred to unresolved scales from the resolved scales and @xmath97 represents the energy and helicity interactions at wavenumbers @xmath98 .",
    "the analytical forms of the above terms come from a two - point analysis of an integro - differential equations originating from the edqnm closure for isotropic navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "thus , our model assumes that isotropy is recovered at sufficiently small scales ( smaller than the zeman scale ) as was recently shown in a large dns of rotating turbulence @xcite .",
    "it may be noted here that the les was able to reproduce the results of this dns on a grid of @xmath99 points in which the zeman scale was resolved @xcite .",
    "finally , eddy - noise ( upscaling of energy towards the resolved scales from the unresolved scales ) is added to the velocity field based on a reconstruction of eq .  .",

    "note that as more energy is injected into the 2d modes ( e.g. , as @xmath101 is increased in the ani runs ) , the wavenumber at which the fluxes change sign moves towards @xmath111 , and for the abc flow the flux @xmath109 is positive everywhere ( i.e. , energy goes from the 2d modes to the 3d modes at all scales ) . as a reference , a schematic representation of the excited modes in axisymmetric fourier space @xmath112",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : en_tr_sch ] .",
    "the above observations imply that the abc flow corresponds to the limiting case in which most of the energy is injected into the 2d modes and as a result of the imbalance , an excess of energy `` leaks '' from the 2d modes to the 3d modes .",
    "this can be verified by computing each term in the energy balance eqs .   and ( see tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "the flux of 3d and 2d energy can be estimated from eqs .   and as follows .",
    "since all terms in these equations , with the exception of @xmath70 and @xmath69 , are known , the equations can be re - written as : @xmath113 and [ eq:2dlhs ] @xmath114 the superscript `` l.h.s . ''",
    "here and in the table indicates that the fluxes are obtained by solving for the l.h.s .  of the balance equations above .",
    "another way of estimating @xmath69 is based on geometrical consideration of the fluxes in spectral space ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : en_tr_sch ] ) , @xmath115 finally , an alternative interpretation of @xmath69 is that it transfers energy to the 3d modes with larger wavenumbers where it is eventually dissipated , and hence it balances the injection term with dissipation of energy per unit of time .",
    "hence , it can also be approximated by @xmath116 .",
    "the two estimates have been found to be of the same order of magnitude in all the runs as shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the fact that the three estimates are positive and of the same order indicate that energy in the 3d modes does not only go to the slow manifold but goes to smaller scales where it dissipates .",
    "the fact that @xmath70 is negative in the abc run ( see table [ tab3 ] ) is evidence of an inverse cascade of energy in the slow manifold once the energy from the 3d modes is transferred to the 2d modes . for the other runs ,",
    "even though @xmath70 is positive and small in magnitude , it merely implies that more energy cascades to the smaller scales than to the larger scales .",

    "the results in @xcite ( with simulations forced at smaller wavenumbers than in our case ) are consistent with our results , except that they attribute the development of the @xmath119 spectrum in the 2d modes to a direct cascade of enstrophy once the 3d modes inject energy directly into the 2d modes with the smallest wavenumbers .",

    "anisotropic forcing ) , the energy injected directly into the 2d modes undergoes an inverse cascade in the slow manifold , and later the excess of energy in these modes relative to the 3d modes `` leaks '' energy into the 3d modes at large scales ( see fig .

    "the relevant quantity for either a @xmath6 or @xmath121 scaling in the inverse cascade energy spectrum is @xmath120 .",
    "indeed , based on the previous discussion , if little energy goes into the 2d modes from the 3d modes , or if energy goes from the 2d modes into the 3d modes with the 2d modes being the most energetic and dominating the dynamics , we can assume that the cascade in the slow manifold is dominated by the turnover time @xmath124 ( where @xmath125 is a characteristic length in the slow manifold and @xmath126 the 2d r.m.s .",

    "kkbl phenomenology tells us that the energy flux goes as : @xmath127 which results in a @xmath121 scaling law . on the other hand ,",
    "if energy goes from the 3d modes to the 2d modes , interactions with the 3d modes can not be neglected .",
    "besides the slow turnover time @xmath128 , we have to consider now the 3d turnover time and the timescale associated with the fast waves , @xmath129 .",
    "there is no unique dimensional solution in this case but we can borrow from the phenomenology developed by kraichnan @xcite for magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence where the effect of the waves modulates the dominant time - scale of the flow .",
    "this phenomenology has been successfully extended to rotating flows @xcite , including in the helical case @xcite .",
    "it states that in the presence of waves , the nonlinear transfer is slowed down because of the waves and the relevant parameter of the problem is the rossby number , i.e. the ratio of time - scales of the wave and the nonlinear turn - over time .",
    "thus , we can assume that the flux will be slowed down by a factor proportional to the ratio @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the relevant ( and unknown ) turnover time for the problem , @xmath132 it is interesting to point out that if the turnover time in the above expression is built upon the velocity at the forcing scale @xmath133 as @xmath134 ( i.e. , assuming interactions are non - local in the inverse cascade range and that most of the energy in the slow manifold comes directly from the 3d forced modes , which is consistent with the large and negative values of @xmath120 in some of the runs ) , eq .   results in a @xmath6 scaling for the energy spectrum of the 2d modes .",

    "[ fig : shear ] , note the amplitude of the spectra of @xmath141 in the figure is normalized by its initial value before rotation is turned on ) . in most of the runs ,",
    "shear decreases when rotation is turned on and the spectrum seems to reach a steady state ( with significantly less shear than the isotropic and homogeneous turbulent flow ) at late times .",
    "however , in the abc run , shear increases at large scales as time evolves ( with a decrease in shear at small scales ) .",
    "the increase in large scale shear in this run can be understood in the light of the previous discussion and based on the fact that @xmath142 . in the case of abc forcing",
    ", @xmath143 of the energy injection corresponds to the 2d modes and the energy in the slow manifold undergoes an inverse cascade .",
    "however , some of the large - scale energy in the 2d modes is transferred back to the 3d modes ( as is evident from @xmath142 ) and the excitation of large - scale 3d modes in turn creates large - scale shear ( note : @xmath144 in the slow manifold when @xmath34 but @xmath145 in the 3d modes ) .",
    "it is interesting that once large - scale shear is present , a new constant time scale ( i.e. , independent of length scale ) appears .",
    "large scale shear is associated with the _ shear time scale _ , @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the largest eigenvalue ( in magnitude ) of @xmath137 at any given location @xmath148 .",
    "dimensional analysis then hints at a flatter energy spectrum , and a @xmath149 energy spectrum ( as observed for the total energy in the abc run ) is not uncommon in shear dominated flows @xcite .",
    "an attempt has been made to provide a coherent treatment of the various large scale physical processes involved in rotating flows with a special emphasis on the breaking of universality in the inverse cascade of energy for rotating turbulence due to the anisotropy in the forcing .",
    "we observe a @xmath3 spectrum in the 2d modes when the forcing is isotropic and the observed spectrum can be associated with an inverse transfer of energy .",
    "this spectrum has been reported before @xcite although it must be said that in @xcite , the observed @xmath150 spectrum is attributed to a direct enstrophy cascade , as is thought to happen in the case of two - dimensional navier - stokes turbulence ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we also find that in the case of strongly anisotropic forcing such as the abc , the inverse cascade for the 2d energy follows a @xmath151 spectral law but the 3d energy follows a shallower law , @xmath152 attributed to the creation of shear at large scales .",
    "of course , a @xmath149 spectrum is not unheard of in turbulence ; it arises for a field which is advected at a constant rate , e.g. , for a passive tracer in a turbulent flow and it is also documented in shear flows @xcite ( see also the recent review in @xcite ) .",
    "although a recent analysis of atmospheric data indicates that the energy cascade is forward at all scales ( see @xcite and references therein ) , it should be noted that the @xmath153 and @xmath154 spectra are both observed .",
    "there is no indication of inverse cascade for the helicity in any of the runs .",
    "however , it is not clear what the origin is of the rather flatter spectrum of the helicity at large scales ( see fig . [",
    "fig : helispec ] and also @xcite , fig .",
    "it is consistent with the fact that the relative helicity becomes negligible at large scales , so this could be simply interpreted as eddy - noise .",
    "this point will have to be investigated further .",
    "note that a @xmath149 scaling law , which implies less energy at large scales , may be consistent with toned down 3d non - linear dynamics due to the strong helicity in the flow .",
    "finally , it must be said that these results are obtained with a sub - grid scale model and due to the non - local interactions that seem to be present in the inverse cascade , the modeling of the small - scale may affect the behavior of the large scales .",
    "this effect is perhaps of less consequence when compared with models using an hyper - viscous term with the dissipation proportional to @xmath155 .",
    "indeed , in our les the computations of the eddy viscosity and eddy noise take into account the energy and the helicity spectra up to @xmath91 , where @xmath80 is the cut - off wavenumber",
    ". we would like to mention that dns of the flows presented in this paper are being performed currently to substantiate the observations based on the les .",
