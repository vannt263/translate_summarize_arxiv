    "it is known that there is a representation formula , using holomorphic null immersions into @xmath2 , for spacelike constant mean curvature ( cmc ) @xmath0 immersions in de sitter @xmath1-space @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "although this formula is very similar to a representation formula for cmc @xmath0 immersions in hyperbolic @xmath1-space @xmath4 ( the so - called bryant representation formula @xcite ) , and the global properties of cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath4 have been investigated @xcite , global properties and singularities of spacelike cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath3 are not yet well understood .",
    "one of the biggest reasons for this is that the only complete spacelike cmc @xmath0 immersion in @xmath3 is the flat totally umbilic immersion @xcite .",
    "this situation is somewhat parallel to the relation between minimal immersions in euclicean @xmath1-space @xmath5 and spacelike maximal immersions in lorentz @xmath1-space @xmath6 , the @xmath5 case having been extensively studied while the @xmath6 case still being not well understood .",
    "recently , umehara and yamada defined spacelike maximal surfaces with certain kinds of `` admissible '' singularities , and named them `` maxfaces '' @xcite .",
    "they then showed that maxfaces are rich objects with respect to global geometry .",
    "so in section [ sec : cmc1faces ] , we introduce admissible singularities of spacelike cmc @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath3 and name these surfaces with admissible singularities `` cmc @xmath0 faces '' .    for cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath4 ,",
    "the monodromy representation at each end is always diagonalizable with eigenvalues in @xmath7 , but this is not true for cmc @xmath0 faces in general .",
    "however , when the monodromy representation at each end of a cmc @xmath0 face is diagonalizable with eigenvalues in @xmath8 , we can directly apply many results for cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath4 to cmc @xmath0 faces .",
    "so in section [ sec : unitaryends ] , we give a definition of `` elliptic ends '' of cmc @xmath0 faces . in section [ sec : embeddedness ] , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for elliptic ends to be embedded .",
    "the total curvature of complete minimal immersions in @xmath5 of finite total curvature satisfies the osserman inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the condition for equality was given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) .",
    "this inequality is a stronger version of the cohn - vossen inequality . for a minimal immersion ,",
    "the total curvature is equal to the degree of its gauss map , multiplied by @xmath9 .",
    "so the osserman inequality can be viewed as an inequality about the degree of the gauss map . in the case of a cmc @xmath0 immersion in @xmath4 , the total curvature never satisfies equality of the cohn - vossen inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.3 ) , and the osserman inequality does not hold in general .",
    "however , using the hyperbolic gauss map instead of the total curvature , an osserman type inequality holds for cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "also , umehara and yamada showed that the osserman inequality holds for maxfaces @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : ossermanineq ] , we give the central result of this paper , that the osserman inequality holds for complete cmc @xmath0 faces of finite type with elliptic ends ( theorem [ th : main ] ) .",
    "_ we remark that the assumptions of finite type and ellipticity of the ends can actually be removed , because , in fact , any complete cmc @xmath0 face must be of finite type and each end must be elliptic .",
    "this deep result will be shown in the forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "_    lee and yang were the first to construct a numerous collection of examples of cmc @xmath0 faces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they constructed complete irreducible cmc @xmath0 faces with three elliptic ends , by using hypergeometric functions @xcite",
    ". we will also give numerous examples here in section [ sec : examples ] , by using a method for transferring cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath4 to cmc @xmath0 faces in @xmath3 . applying this method to examples in @xcite ,",
