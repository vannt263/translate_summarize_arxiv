    "the phase behavior of systems whose constituent particles interact by means of pair potentials diverging at the origin is a problem that has been extensively studied in the last few decades .",
    "the whole range of inverse power - law pair potentials have been examined , ranging from hard spheres ( hs ) to the one - component plasma ( ocp ) and it has been established that excluded volume effects are mainly responsible for bringing about the freezing transition . the crystal structure in which a liquid freezes is subsequently determined by the steepness of the repulsion , with hard repulsions favoring a face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice and soft ones a body centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice @xcite .",
    "power - law diverging potentials result into freezing at arbitrarily high temperatures .",
    "however , the divergence of the potential alone is not enough to cause such a phenomenon , as demonstrated recently by watzlawek _",
    "@xcite who employed a logarithmically divergent pair potential , suitable to describe effective interactions between star polymers in good solvents .",
    "it was shown that the strength ( prefactor ) of the logarithmic potential , determined by the number of arms @xmath1 of the stars , is crucial in determining whether the system freezes or remains fluid at all densities . as a consequence ,",
    "the phase diagram of star polymers was predicted to display reentrant melting and a critical freezing value @xmath2 of arms , such that for @xmath3 the system remains always fluid @xcite",
    ".    another interesting class of interactions are those which do not diverge at the origin , i.e. , they are _",
    "bounded_. such potentials arise naturally as _ effective interactions _ between the centers of mass of soft , flexible macromolecules such as polymer chains @xcite , dendrimers @xcite , polyelectrolytes etc",
    ". indeed , the centers of mass of two macromolecules can coincide without violation of the excluded volume conditions , hence bringing about a bounded interaction .",
    "moreover , the same mechanisms that exist for tuning the usual , diverging interactions between colloidal particles can be applied in order to tune the bounded interactions : the solvent quality , temperature , chain length , salt concentration etc .",
    "will all affect the effective potential .",
    "thus , it appears to be useful to consider such potentials in some generality in order to be able to draw conclusions about the expected phase behavior of systems interacting by means of these .    two model systems in this category",
    "have already been studied in some detail .",
    "one is the penetrable spheres model ( psm ) @xcite , in which the pair potential is a positive constant @xmath4 for distances @xmath5 and vanishes otherwise .",
    "the other is the gaussian core model ( gcm ) , introduced in the mid - seventies by stillinger @xcite . in the gcm",
    ", the pair potential @xmath6 has the form @xmath7 $ ] , with @xmath4 being an energy and @xmath8 a length scale .",
    "it has been shown that the gcm models very accurately the effective interactions between the centers of mass of linear polymer chains @xcite .",
    "the psm was studied by means of cell - model calculations and computer simulations @xcite , liquid - state integral equation theories @xcite and density - functional theory @xcite ; the fluid structure of the psm has been further studied recently by rosenfeld _ et al .",
    "_ by using ideas based on the universality of the bridge functional @xcite .",
    "it was found that no reentrant melting takes place because the solid always lowers its free energy by allowing for multiply occupied crystal sites , a mechanism that is called _ clustering _",
    "the clustering mechanism stabilizes therefore the solid at all temperatures .",
    "hence , the topology of the phase diagram of the psm is similar to that of power - law diverging potentials , when details about the clustering structure of the solids are disregarded . on the other hand ,",
    "the gcm has been studied even more extensively by means of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , high - temperature expansions @xcite and the discovery of exact duality relations in the crystalline state @xcite .",
    "recently , a full statistical - mechanical study of the gcm was performed and it was established that the topology of the phase diagram of the gcm resembles that of star polymers .",
    "freezing and reentrant melting accompanied by an upper freezing temperature were quantitatively calculated @xcite . the question that arises",
    ", therefore , is the following . given a nonattractive and bounded pair potential which satisfies the following requirements guaranteeing stability and the existence of the thermodynamic limit @xcite :    1 .",
    "it is bounded ; 2 .",
    "it is positive definite ; 3 .",
    "it decays fast enough to zero at large separations , so that it is integrable and its fourier transform exists ;    to which topology belongs the phase diagram of the system ? in this paper , we present an exact criterion which gives an answer to this question and show representative results for model systems which confirm its validity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the physical arguments supporting the mean - field theory of the models and in section iii we discuss the existence of a spinodal instability in this theory and its implications on the phase bahavior .",
    "we present a systematic comparison between theory and simulation in section iv and we draw the generic phase diagrams of such systems in section v. finally , in section vi we summarize and conclude .",
    "we will work with a general interaction @xmath9 satisfying the requirements put forward above .",
    "here , @xmath4 and @xmath8 are an energy and a length , respectively , and @xmath10 is some dimensionless function .",
    "the latter does _ not _ have to be analytic , i.e. , discontinuities in the potential or its derivatives are allowed . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath11 .",
    "let us call @xmath12 the dimensionless fourier transform ( ft ) of the interaction . for more concreteness ( and for the purposes of demonstration )",
    "we introduce in addition the family of bounded potentials @xmath13 depending on a tunable parameter @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath14 is a ` smoothing parameter ' having dimensions of length .",
    "the case @xmath16 recovers the psm whereas as @xmath14 grows the interaction becomes smoother . due to its resemblance to the fermi - dirac distribution",
    ", we call this family the fermi distribution model ( fdm )",
    ". the additional factor @xmath17 in the numerator of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ fermi ] ) ensures that the potential varies from @xmath4 at @xmath18 to zero at @xmath19 , for all @xmath14 .",
    "we introduce dimensionless measures of temperature and density as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath22 is the density of a system of @xmath23 particles in the volume @xmath24 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath25 as the ` packing fraction ' of the system .",
    "the key idea for examining the high temperature and/or high density limit of such model systems is the following .",
    "we consider in general a spatially modulated density profile @xmath26 which does not vary too rapidly on the scale @xmath8 set by the interaction . at high densities , @xmath27 ,",
    "the average interparticle distance @xmath28 becomes vanishingly small , and it holds @xmath29 , i.e. , the potential is extremely long - range .",
    "every particle is simultaneously interacting with an enormous number of neighboring molecules and in the absence of short - range excluded volume interactions the excess free energy of the system @xcite can be approximated by a simple mean - field term , equal to the internal energy of the system : @xmath30 \\cong { { 1}\\over{2 } } \\int\\int d{\\bf r } d{\\bf r ' } v(|{\\bf r } - { \\bf r'}| ) \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\rho({\\bf r ' } ) , \\label{dft.mfa}\\ ] ] with the approximation becoming more accurate with increasing density .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ dft.mfa ] ) immediately implies that in this limit the direct correlation function @xmath31 of the system , defined as @xcite @xmath32}\\over   { \\delta \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\delta \\rho({\\bf r ' } ) } } , \\label{dcf.dft}\\ ] ] becomes independent of the density and is simply proportional to the interaction , namely @xmath33 using the last equation , together with the ornstein - zernike relation @xcite , we readily obtain an analytic expression for the structure factor @xmath34 of the system as @xmath35 this mean - field approximation ( mfa ) has been put forward and examined in detail in the context of the gaussian core model independently by lang _",

    "@xcite and by louis _",

    "the model is particularly relevant from the physics point of view , due to its connection to the theory of effective interactions between polymer chains @xcite . here",
    ", we establish the validity of the mfa at high densities for bounded , positive - definite interactions _ in general _ and we examine its implications for the global phase behavior of such systems",
    ".    bounded and positive - definite interactions have been studied in the late seventies by grewe and klein @xcite .",
    "the authors considered a slightly different model than the one considered here , namely a kac potential of the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the dimension of the space and @xmath38 is a parameter controlling the range _ and _ strength of the potential .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 is a nonnegative , bounded and integrable function : @xmath40 grewe and klein were able to show rigorously that at the limit @xmath41 , the direct correlation function of a system interacting by means of the potential ( [ kac ] ) is given by eq .",
    "( [ msa ] ) above .",
    "the connection with the case we are discussing here is straightforward : as there are no hard cores in the system or a lattice constant to impose a length scale , the only relevant length is set by the density and is equal to @xmath42 in our model and by the parameter @xmath43 in model ( [ kac ] ) . in this respect ,",
    "the limit @xmath41 in the kac model of grewe and klein is equivalent to the limit @xmath44 considered here .",
    "however , in the kac model the strength of the interaction goes to zero simultaneously with the increase in its range .",
    "moreover , the validity of the mean - field expression at large but finite densities and at low temperatures has not been tested in detail .",
    "we employ the mfa as a physically motivated _ working hypothesis _ for now and , by direct comparison with simulation results , we will show later that it is indeed valid . within the framework of this theory ,",
    "an exact criterion can be formulated , concerning the stability of the liquid phase at high temperatures and densities .",
    "the function @xmath10 was assumed to be decaying monotonically from unity at @xmath45 to zero at @xmath46 .",
    "for the function @xmath47 , there are two possibilities : ( i ) it has a monotonic decay from the value @xmath48 to the value @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "we call such potentials @xmath51-_potentials_. obviously , the gaussian interaction belongs to this class .",
    "( ii ) it has oscillatory behavior at large @xmath52 , with the implication that it is a nonmonotonic function of @xmath52 , attaining necessarily negative values for certain ranges of the wavenumber .",
    "we call such potentials @xmath53-_potentials_. long - range oscillations in @xmath52-space imply that @xmath10 changes more rapidly from unity at @xmath18 to zero at @xmath19 in the @xmath53-class than in the @xmath51 one .",
    "moreover , let us call @xmath54 the value of @xmath52 at which @xmath47 attains its minimum , _ negative _ value .",
    "if we are dealing with a @xmath53-potential eq .",
    "( [ sofq.analytic ] ) implies that @xmath34 has a maximum at precisely the wavevector @xmath55 where @xmath47 attains its negative minimum , @xmath56 and this maximum becomes a _ singularity _ at the ` spinodal line ' @xmath57 , signaling the so - called kirkwood instability of the system @xcite .",
    "the theory has a divergence , implying that the underlying assumption of a uniform liquid is not valid and the system must reach a crystalline state .",
    "indeed , on the basis of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath34 can be interpreted as a response function of the density to an infinitesimal external modulating field at wavenumber @xmath52 @xcite and a diverging value of this response function clearly signals an instability . if the fourier transform of @xmath10 has negative fourier components , then an increase in temperature can be compensated by an increase in density in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ sofq.analytic ] ) , so that @xmath58 will have a divergence at all @xmath59 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath53-_systems freeze at all temperatures_.    if we are dealing with a @xmath51-potential ( @xmath47 monotonic ) , then eq .",
    "( [ sofq.analytic ] ) implies that @xmath34 is also a monotonic function of @xmath52 at high densities @xcite . for such potentials ,",
    "one can always find a temperature high enough , so that the assumptions of eq .",
    "( [ dft.mfa ] ) hold and then eq .  ( [ sofq.analytic ] )",
    "forces the conclusion that freezing of the system is impossible at such temperatures .",
    "this does not imply , of course , that such systems do not freeze at all ; one simply has to go to a low enough temperature and density , so that the mean - field assumption does not hold and the interaction is much larger that the thermal energy .",
    "then , the system will display a hard - sphere type of freezing , to be discussed more explicitly below .",
    "an upper freezing temperature @xmath60 must exist for @xmath51-potentials , implying that such systems must remelt at @xmath61 upon increase of the density .",
    "hence , we reach the conclusion that @xmath51-_systems display an upper freezing temperature and reentrant melting_. the criterion says nothing about the crystal structure of the solid , however , which always depends on the details of the interaction as well as the density @xcite .    for potentials is in the @xmath51-class , the mean - field arguments presented above hold not only at high temperatures but also at low ones , provided that the requirement @xmath27 is satisfied , because these are molten at high densities for all nonzero temperatures .",
    "the validity of the mean - field theory for @xmath51-type systems , even at very low temperatures , was confirmed recently by direct comparison with simulation results for the particular case of the gaussian potential @xcite .",
    "if the potential is in the @xmath53-class , the mean field approximation holds provided that the system is not already frozen , as we will confirm shortly .",
    "moreover , both kinds of systems display an unusual kind of ` high density ideal gas ' limit . indeed , taking the expression ( [ sofq.analytic ] ) for @xmath34 and using the relation @xmath62 @xcite , where @xmath63 is the dimensionless fourier transform of the pair correlation function @xmath64 of the uniform fluid , we obtain : @xmath65    at low @xmath52 s , where @xmath47 is of order unity , the term proportional to the density in the denominator dominates in the limit of high densities and @xmath63 scales as @xmath66 . at high @xmath52 s ,",
    "the fourier transform @xmath67 in the numerator is itself small , with the result that @xmath63 , and hence also the correlation function @xmath64 , is approaching zero .",
    "this , in turn , means that the radial distribution function @xmath68 is very close to unity in this limit and deprived of any significant structure for all values of @xmath0 and it only has some small structure at small @xmath0 , which is in fact more pronounced for @xmath53-potentials than for @xmath51 ones .",
    "in this limit , the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) closure becomes exact , as the exact relation @xmath69 $ ] , combined with the limits @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 forces the bridge function @xmath73 to vanish .",
    "moreover , eqs .",
    "( [ sofq.analytic ] ) and ( [ hofq ] ) reveal that the systems obey a scaling law , namely that the functions @xmath34 and @xmath74 do not depend on @xmath75 and @xmath59 separately but only on the ratio @xmath76 .",
    "systems in the @xmath53-class freeze before the spinodal is reached . in order to make quantitative predictions , we invoke the empirical hansen - verlet freezing criterion @xcite , which states that a system crystallizes when @xmath34 at its main peak attains , approximately , the value @xmath77 .",
    "although this criterion was originally put forward for hard , atomic interactions ( hs , lennard - jones etc . ) , recent detailed analyses have demonstrated that it holds for the freezing and the remelting transitions of ultrasoft particles such as star polymers @xcite and even for the nondiverging gaussian interaction @xcite .",
    "hence , we assume that it is valid for the general class of systems we consider here and combining it with eq .",

    "[ phdg.plot ] , we show the phase diagram for a system with @xmath144 , showing reentrant melting behavior .",
    "the evolution of the phase diagram from a clustering to a reentrant melting behavior can be easily visualized from this picture .    finally , it is important to point out that stillinger has proven that any system interacting by means of a potential which ( i ) is differentiable at least four times , ( ii ) vanishes strongly enough at infinity to be integrable and ( iii ) is + 1 at the origin , will inevitably lead to a reentrant melting phase diagram _ under the assumption _ that the competing crystal structures have _ single lattice site occupancy _ @xcite .",
    "we can therefore now complete the statement and say that if a potential belongs to the @xmath51-class , then it will freeze into crystals of single occupancy and then remelt upon increase of the density .",
    "but if it belongs to the @xmath53-class , then it will freeze into a clustered solid at any temperature .",
    "clustering appears therefore to be the crucial mechanism for crystal stabilization in these systems .",
    "to summarize , we have established a criterion for the topology of the phase diagrams resulting from repulsive , bounded interactions , which is very simple in its formulation and states that if the fourier transform of the pair potential is positive - definite , then the system shows reentrant melting but if not then it freezes at all temperatures , into clustered crystals with multiply occupied sites .",
    "we have also established that at temperatures exceeding the interaction strength the mean - field theory is reliable at _ all _ densities and its accuracy improves quickly with increasing temperature .",
    "we close with the remark that there is a certain similarity between the ideas put forward here and the considerations on freezing for systems featuring of _ diverging _ interactions at _ infinite _ spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter case , the direct correlation function is given by the mayer function @xmath145 - 1 $ ] of the interaction potential and not by @xmath146 as in the case at hand .",
