    "in the study of the static properties of finite systems the main quantity of interest is the density of states @xmath0 as it contains the complete physical information of the investigated system @xcite . to be specific , consider a magnetic system where @xmath1 is a function of the energy @xmath2 and of the magnetization @xmath3 ( which can be a scalar or a vector quantity , depending on the system ) . with the density of states at hand",
    "one may proceed in the canonical way by computing the free energy from which other quantities such as the susceptibility of the specific heat can be derived . in the last years , however , an increasing number of groups have chosen to directly investigate the density of states or , equivalently , the microcanonical entropy @xmath4 ( setting @xmath5 ) . the origin of this increasing interest in the microcanonical approach can be found in the observation that ensembles are not always equivalent @xcite .",
    "the inequivalenve of ensemble is for example encountered in situations where the macroscopic limit ( for example due to the presence of long - range interactions such as the gravitational force ) does not exist . but also in finite systems with short - range interactions the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles may give different results although the ensembles have to become equivalent in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this is especially the case for finite systems which in the macroscopic limit undergo a phase transition .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to discuss the finite - size signatures of phase transitions in the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    "we recall that in the microcanonical approach all quantities of interest can exclusively be expressed as derivatives of the entropy @xcite . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss the case of discontinuous phase transitions which lead to a characteristic behaviour of the specific heat in finite microcanonical systems .",
    "section 4 is the main part of this paper .",
    "it is devoted to the signatures of continuous phase transitions encountered in the microcanonical analysis of small systems .",
    "we also discuss different ways for extracting the values of critical exponents directly from the derivatives of the microcanonical entropy .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "we use in the following the language of magnetism and consider a magnetic system with @xmath6 degrees of freedom isolated from any environment . the state of the system is then characterized by its energy @xmath2 and its magnetization @xmath3 .    in the microcanonical analysis one",
    "considers the microcanonical entropy density @xmath7 as function of the energy density @xmath8 and the magnetization density @xmath9 .",
    "the entropy surface @xmath10 still exhibits a weak size dependence which is not explicitly denoted here .",
    "sometimes one is only interested in the energy dependence and therefore studies the reduced specific entropy @xmath11 with @xmath12 microcanonical quantities can be expressed by functions of derivatives of the specific microcanonical entropy .",
    "for example , the microcanonical temperature reads @xmath13 which leads to the following expression for the specific heat : @xmath14 it is worth noting that the microcanonical temperature and specific heat can also be defined through the entropy density ( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "these differently defined quantities get identical in the infinite volume limit .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a thorough discussion of this point .",
    "further quantities discussed in the following include the spontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization @xmath15 is defined to be the value of @xmath16 where the entropy ( [ eq : s ] ) at a fixed value of @xmath17 has its maximum with respect to @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath18 to better understand this definition consider the density of states @xmath19 for a given energy @xmath17 .",
    "the density of states exhibits a sharp maximum as the overwhelming majority of accessible states belongs to the value @xmath20 of @xmath16 where @xmath21 has its maximum .",
    "this is the reason why we identify @xmath20 with the spontaneous magnetization of the finite system .",
    "this definition of the microcanonical spontaneous magnetization ensures that we recover the canonically defined spontaneous magnetization in the macroscopic limit .",
    "note also that one can define a magnetic field for the microcanonical ensemble which appears as the conjugate variable to @xmath16 . at the spontaneous magnetization",
    "@xmath20 the associated magnetic field becomes zero , see @xcite for further details .",
    "of further interest is the suceptibility @xcite @xmath22 where the denominator on the right hand side is in fact the local curvature of the entropy surface .",
    "as it stands , eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) is only valid in cases where the order parameter is a scalar . for an order parameter with vector character ( as encountered for example in classical spin models like the @xmath23 or the heisenberg model ) the susceptibility is given by a matrix @xcite .",
    "the entries of the susceptibility matrix are then dependent on the local curvature with respect to the different order parameter components .    closing this section",
    ", we reemphasize that the microcanically defined quantities all fulfill the important request that they become identical to the better known canonical quantities in the infinite system after the trivial transformation from the natural variables @xmath17 and @xmath16 of the microcanonical description to the natural variables temperature @xmath24 and magnetic field @xmath25 of the canonical approach .",
    "the interest in the microcanonical analysis really started with the observation that discontinuous phase transitions display typical and very interesting finite - size signatures in the microcanonical treatment @xcite .",
    "indeed , a discontinuous phase transition reveals itself in finite systems by a convex intruder in the microcanonical entropy which originates from states of coexistence of different phases . in the canonical treatment these states are unstable and can not be accessed by equilibrium methods .",
    "interestingly , this convex intruder leads to a characteristic backbending of the caloric curve and thus to a negative specific heat .",
    "the appearance of a negative specific heat may look like an oddity of the microcanonical approach .",
    "however , there have been recent claims that negative specific heats had been measured ( even so in a somewhat indirect way ) in experiments on nuclear fragmentation @xcite or on the solid - liquid transition of atomic clusters @xcite .",
    "the main intention of this paper is to discuss the typical finite - size signatures of continuous phase transitions encountered in the microcanonical approach .",
    "we thereby focus on classical spin systems and shall discuss in the following the two- and three - dimensional ising models on hypercubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the ising model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath26 where the lattice site @xmath27 is characterized by the classical variable @xmath28 .",
    "the sum in equation ( [ eq : ising ] ) is over nearest neighbour pairs .",
    "the two - dimensional three - state potts @xcite and the three - dimensional @xmath23 @xcite models have also been studied recently in the present context , but we will not discuss these models here .",
    "all the mentioned models have in common that the corresponding infinite system displays a continuous phase transition separating a paramagnetic phase at high temperatures ( energies ) from a ferromagnetically ordered phase at low temperatures ( energies ) .      in the canonical ensemble",
    "the typical features of spontaneous symmetry breaking like the abrupt onset of the order parameter or a diverging susceptibility are only encountered in the infinite system . in any finite system one",
    "does not observe diverging quantities but only rounded maxima .",
    "this is , however , completely different in the microcanonical ensemble where the features of spontaneous symmetry breaking turn up already for finite systems @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to first inspect directly the entropy surface @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig_1 ] displays this entropy surface for a three - dimensional ising model with @xmath29 spins .",
    "the fully magnetized states at @xmath30 and @xmath31 form the two degenerate gound states , whereas the fully disordered macrostate at @xmath32 has the highest degeneracy of all .",
    "this entropy surface has been computed by a very efficient numerical method based on the concept of transition variables @xcite .",
    "more insights are gained by looking at cuts through the entropy surface along the magnetization at a fixed energy @xmath17 , see figure [ fig_2 ] .",
    "one observes that the entropy exhibits only one maximum at @xmath33 for energies @xmath17 above an energy @xmath34 , whereas for energies @xmath35 two maxima are seen at nonzero magnetizations , separated by a minimum at @xmath33 . at the energy @xmath36 the curvature in magnetization direction vanishes at @xmath33 .",
    "= 6.0 in     = 4.0 in     recalling that the spontaneous magnetization is identified with the magnetization where for a fixed energy the density of states is the largest , one can directly extract the value of the spontaneous magnetization at a given energy from cuts like those shown in figure [ fig_2 ] .",
    "the resulting behaviour of the spontaneous magnetization is discussed in figure [ fig_3 ] for three - dimensional ising models containing @xmath29 and @xmath37 spins .",
    "two different regimes are observed : for @xmath38 the spontaneous magnetization is zero , whereas for @xmath35 it is given by @xmath39 , in accordance with the appearance of two maxima of the entropy surface at lower energies . at the well - defined size - dependent energy @xmath36 the order parameter sets in abruptly already in finite systems .",
    "the energy @xmath36 may therefore be called transition energy .",
    "= 4.0 in     another remarkable finite - size signature of continuous phase transitions is shown in figure [ fig_4 ] .",
    "a divergence of the magnetic susceptibility is observed for finite systems at the same energy @xmath36 at which the order parameter bifurcates .",
    "this divergence is in fact readily understood by recalling , see equation ( [ eq : chi ] ) , that the susceptibility is proportional to the inverse of the curvature of the entropy surface .",
    "it is the existence of a point of vanishing curvature that is responsible for the observed divergence of the susceptibility , see figure [ fig_2 ] .",
    "= 4.0 in     the microcanonical specific heat , on the other hand , does not diverge in finite systems .",
    "it nevertheless also displays an intriguing finite - size behaviour , as revealed recently for models with a diverging specific heat in the infinite system @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the microcanonical ensemble the maximum of the specific heat of the corresponding finite systems varies non - monotonically when increasing the size of the system .",
    "starting with small systems , it first _ decreases _ for increasing system sizes , before it increases for larger systems and finally diverges in the macroscopic limit .",
    "this behavious is in strong contrast to the treatment in the canonical ensemble where a monotonic increase of the maximum of the specific heat with the size of the system is always observed @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a phenomenological theory has been proposed that acccounts for the observed non - monotonic variation of the maximum of the microcanonical specific heat .      at this stage one",
    "may wonder whether the typical features of spontaneous symmetry breaking observed in finite microcanonical systems are described by the true critical exponents of the infinite system .",
    "a rapid inspection of the numerical data reveals that this is not the case .",
    "indeed , the onset of the order parameter or the divergence of the suceptibility in finite microcanonical systems are in all cases governed by the classical mean - field exponents @xcite .",
    "this is readily understood by noting that the entropy surface can be expanded in a taylor series in the vicinity of @xmath36 ( for a discrete spin model a suitable continuous function that represents the data has to be chosen ) . as a consequence one ends up with a landau - like theory @xcite which for the microcanonical entropy of a finite system is in principle exact , thus yielding classical values for the critical exponents . in recent years",
    "we have developed different approaches that enable us nevertheless to obtain the true critical exponents by exclusively analyzing the density of states of finite systems @xcite .    before discussing these approaches for the spontaneous magnetization in some detail we have first to pause briefly in order to recall that in the entropy formalism considered here critical exponents often differ from their thermal counterparts .",
    "this is the case when the specific heat diverges algebraically at the critical point of the infinite system , implying that the critical exponent @xmath40 , governing the power - law behaviour of the canonical specific heat in the vicinity of the critical point , is positive .",
    "it is then easily shown that the critical exponents @xmath41 appearing in the microcanonical analysis are related to the thermal critical exponents @xmath42 by @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "however , when the specific heat does not diverge but presents a cusp - like singularity as @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 @xcite . in the case of a logarithmically diverging specific heat",
    "the thermal and microcanonical exponents are also identical .",
    "let us now come back to the determination of the critical exponents . as already mentioned we obtain classical values for the critical exponents when expanding the finite - size quantities around the energy @xmath36 .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization , for example , displays a root singularity for energies @xmath35 close to @xmath36 : @xmath46 where the amplitude @xmath47 depends on the system size . in the infinite system one",
    "expands around the true critical point @xmath48 , leading to the asymptotic behaviour @xmath49 for small @xmath50 with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the ground state energy per degree of freedom . the critical exponent @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the usual thermal critical exponent characterizing the singularity of the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "here we suppose that @xmath56 , as it is the case for the ising model .",
    "away from the critical point the spontaneous magnetization of the infinite system is not any more given by the simple expression ( [ eq : mexpinf ] ) , as correction terms get important .",
    "one way to deal with these correction terms is to analyse the energy dependent effective exponents @xmath57 that yields the true critical exponent @xmath53 in the limit @xmath58 @xcite .    in order to use equation ( [ eq : beff ] )",
    "we need data free of finite - size effects . on the other hand one",
    "observes in figure [ fig_3 ] that there exists a energy interval for which the spontaneous magnetizations computed in systems of different sizes are identical .",
    "this suggest the following procedure for computing @xmath53 .",
    "calculate the spontaneous magnetization for a series of increasing system sizes @xmath59 . in the energy range where @xmath60 and @xmath61 yield the same exponent @xmath62 , select this exponent for the infinite system , until finite - size effects show up . then plot the common exponent for system sizes @xmath61 and @xmath63 until these begin to disagree and so on .",
    "this procedure is rather cumbersome but ensures that data essentially free of finite - size effects are obtained .",
    "the result of this approach @xcite for the two- and the three - dimensional ising models is shown in figure [ fig_4 ] .",
    "for the three - dimensional case we observe that @xmath62 rapidly approaches a constant value that perfectly agrees with the expected asymptotic value @xmath64 . in two dimensions",
    "the agreement is not as perfect , even so a reasonable estimate of @xmath53 is obtained by linearly extrapolating the existing data .",
    "the situation is indeed more complicated in the two - dimensional ising model , as one is dealing here with the rather pathological case of a logarithmically diverging specific heat with @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , we expect for any model with @xmath66 a similar good agreement between the expected value of @xmath53 and the value obtained from linearly extrapolating @xmath67 as for the three - dimenisonal ising model .",
    "this expectation has recently been confirmed for the three - dimensional @xmath23 model @xcite .",
    "= 4.0 in     the determination of critical exponents via effective exponents has the major drawback that data free of finite - size effects have to be obtained , which means that systems of increasing sizes have to be simulated on approach to the critical point . for figure [ fig_5 ]",
    "our largest systems contained @xmath68 spins in two and @xmath69 spins in three dimensions .",
    "simulating these systems is very time consuming even with the best algorithms available .",
    "the second approach for determining the values of critical exponents discussed in the following does not need large systems , but instead it explicitly takes advantage of the finite - size effects .    in the canonical ensemble finite - size scaling theory",
    "is a valuable and often used tool for extracting critical exponents from finite - size data .",
    "its starting point is the observation that in the asymptotic limit @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 being the critical temperature ) the behaviour of finite - size quantities is governed by scaling functions that are basically determined by the ratio @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the correlation length and @xmath75 the linear extension of the @xmath76-dimensional system @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have developed a microcanonical finite - size scaling theory that takes advantage of the existence of a well - defined transition point @xmath36 in finite microcanonical systems .",
    "the starting point is the scaling behaviour of the entropy of finite systems considered as a function of the energy , the magnetization and the inverse system size .",
    "this then leads to the scaling form @xmath77 of the spontaneous magnetization ( [ eq : msp ] ) . here",
    "@xmath78 is a scaling function characterizing the given universality class and @xmath79 is a nonuniversal constant which is different for the various model systems belonging to the same universality class .",
    "the exponent @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the usual thermal critical exponent governing the divergence of the correlation length on approach to the critical point .",
    "as the spontaneous magnetization presents a square root singularity in any finite microcanonical system , the scaling function @xmath78 varies for small scaling variables @xmath83 as @xmath84 . in figure [ fig_6 ] we test the scaling form ( [ eq : scal ] ) for the usual ising model ( [ eq : ising ] ) with only nearest neighbour interactions ( denoted by i ) and for a generalized ising model with equivalent nearest and next - nearest neighbour interactions ( denoted by gi ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of this latter model is given by @xmath85 where the second sum is over bonds connecting next - nearest neighbours .",
    "the model ( [ eq : gi ] ) belongs to the same universality class as the standard ising model ( [ eq : ising ] ) so that both models should yield the same values for universal quantities .",
    "= 4.0 in     figure [ fig_6 ] illustrates two different aspects of the scaling behaviour of the microcanonically defined spontaneous magnetization . on the one hand it shows that both for the ising model and for the gi model a data collapse can be achieved by plotting @xmath86 as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "the values of the involved critical exponents are thereby obtained by the best data collapse .",
    "this yields the values @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) for the ising ( gi ) model , in excellent agreement with the expected values @xmath92 and @xmath93 . on the other hand figure [ fig_6 ]",
    "also proves that the scaling function @xmath78 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scal ] ) is the same for both models , in accordance with its expected universality .",
    "indeed , the data of both models fall on a common master curve when adjusting the nonuniversal constant @xmath79 , so that @xmath94 . as shown in @xcite scaling functions obtained for models belonging to different universality classes are indeed different .    the microcanonical finite - size scaling theory , which has also been applied successfully to the potts @xcite and to the @xmath23 @xcite models , is very promising .",
    "one of the remarkable point is that no _ a priori _ knowledge of the infinite system is needed . especially , one does not need to know the exact location of the critical point of the infinite system .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the signatures of phase transitions in finite microcanonical systems .",
    "discontinuous phase transitions are announced in the microcanonical ensemble by a backbending of the caloric curve and the appearance of negative specific heat .",
    "continuous phase transitions also lead to intriguing finite - size signatures .",
    "indeed , typical features of spontaneous symmetry breaking like the onset of the order parameter or the divergence of the susceptibility are already encountered in finite microcanonical systems .",
    "these singularities are governed by the classical mean - field exponents .",
    "we have discussed in this paper two different approaches that nevertheless enable us to extract the true critical exponents from the density of states of finite systems .",
    "one approach involves effective exponents , whereas the other is based on a microcanonical finite - size scaling theory .",
    "the latter approach explicitly takes advantage of the existence of a well - defined transition point in any finite microcanonical system .",
