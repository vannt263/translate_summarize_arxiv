    "fundamental aspects of phase transitions in complex systems can be revealed by the analysis of its microcanonical thermostatistics  @xcite , which is characterised by the well known entropy @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the density of states of a system with energy @xmath5 . in particular , the analysis of inflection points of the microcanonical inverse temperature @xmath6 plays an important role in the identification of stable , unstable and metastable regions in the phase diagram  @xcite , providing alternative insights to the usual canonical analysis .",
    "also , free - energy profiles can be obtained from the caloric curves @xmath7 vs @xmath5 , from where one can easily evaluate the values of barrier heights and latent heats . in this way , the microcanonical thermostatistics analysis has been incorporated in many studies in the literature , _",
    "e.g. _  refs .",
    "@xcite to name a few .",
    "nevertheless , any analysis must rely on data obtained from efficient exploration of the configurational space .",
    "it is well known that numerical simulations performed with monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) methods pose limitations to the achievement of reliable data sampling @xcite .",
    "such limitations are related to the critical slowing down @xcite , which is observed in studies of continuous phase transitions , and to the entrapment in local minima , in the case of systems with rugged energy landscapes . in both cases ,",
    "the configurational space is poorly explored in a reasonable computational simulation time , which may produce biased physical averages . to overcome the trapping problem ,",
    "it has been suggested that configurations must be sampled using algorithms based on generalised ensembles , where the updates are performed with non - boltzmann statistical weights @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , the multicanonical algorithm ( muca ) @xcite , the extended gaussian ensemble ( ege ) @xcite , tsallis statistical weight @xcite , and replica exchange method ( rem ) @xcite either use a series of boltzmann weights or any convenient generalised sampling weight @xcite .",
    "muca simulations sample configurations with a weight @xmath9 in such a way that the energy distribution is uniform , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , a precise determination of @xmath9 is equivalent to obtain an estimate for the density of states @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath11 . the weights @xmath12 $ ] follows from the parameterization of the entropy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the so - called multicanonical parameters .",
    "the iterative procedure to obtain the muca parameters is described in detail in references @xcite , and can be read as , @xmath16e_{m } , \\label{eq : an } \\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath17 stands for the @xmath17th multicanonical simulation .",
    "the recursion steps require the discretisation of the energy for continuous energy models .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to define @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the binsize , @xmath20 is an integer , and @xmath21 is a constant that defines a reference energy .",
    "all the energies @xmath5 in the interval @xmath22 contribute to the histogram @xmath23 .",
    "methods to improve sampling based on simulations at different temperatures have been proposed to either be conducted in parallel ( rem ) or as a random walk between different temperatures . in rem ,",
    "@xmath24 non - interacting replicas of the system are simultaneously simulated by the usual mc or md algorithms , and from time to time , pairs of replicas at neighboring temperatures are exchanged with a transition probability . from the data produced by simulations performed at a single temperature @xmath25 or at a set of temperatures @xmath26 , with @xmath27 ,",
    "it is necessary to employ a reweighing scheme to evaluate physical averages at a given temperature @xmath28 .",
    "reweighting techniques @xcite use data from either a single histogram or multiple histograms obtained from mc or md simulations .",
    "recently , a simple method called statistical weighted histogram analysis method ( st - wham )  @xcite has been proposed as an iteration - free procedure to obtain an estimate for the microcanonical inverse temperature . in this method",
    "the usual wham equations  @xcite are converted into a weighted average of the individual densities of states obtained from simulations carried out with different sampling weights @xmath8 . from energy histograms produced by multiple simulations , st - wham yields a statistical temperature @xmath29 , which is an estimate of the inverse microcanonical temperature @xmath30 .",
    "interestingly , there is a numerical procedure based on the multicanonical recursion relations ( [ eq : an ] ) and ( [ eq : bn ] ) , which is called st - wham - muca @xcite , that can be used to replace the direct integration in order to evaluate the entropy @xmath1 .",
    "although both st - wham and st - wham - muca have the advantage of _ a posteriori _ discretisation of energies , their naive implementations may lead to biased evaluations of physical quantities for continuous energy models just like all the aforementioned algorithms .    as described in section",
    "ii , the estimates @xmath31 for inverse microcanonical temperature @xmath0 depends on the derivatives of the energy histograms @xmath2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : st - wham2 ] ) ) . here",
    ", we analyse how the estimates @xmath31 are energy binning dependent and , in section iii , we present two alternative approaches that avoids the need for energy binning to evaluate the microcanonical caloric curve for continuous energy models : ( i ) a proposal by berg and harris  @xcite , which involves an empirical cumulative distribution ( cdf ) and uses discrete fourier series ; and ( ii ) a bayesian approach  @xcite to model this cdf and assumes that the thermodynamic phase transitions are well described by the coexistence of two phases . a comparative analysis between these approaches",
    "is made in order to characterise @xmath0 for two systems that undergo first - order - like phase transitions : the folding transition of a coarse - grained protein model for ubiquitin and the aggregation transition of two heteropolymers that follows a fibonacci sequence .",
    "these examples allow us to describe the statistical and systematic errors involved in the numerical calculations of @xmath2 and @xmath32 , which are presented in section iv .",
    "conclusions on this comparative analysis are presented in section v.",
    "the st - wham @xcite yields a direct estimate of the inverse microcanonical temperature @xmath33 by considering the statistical inverse temperature @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "it is preferable to write eq .",
    "( [ eq : st - wham1 ] ) as @xmath38 note that @xmath39 for simulations with the canonical weight . with the set of estimates @xmath40 , muca recurrence relations ( [ eq :",
    "an ] ) and ( [ eq : bn ] ) can be applied to obtain estimates @xmath41 for the microcanonical entropy @xmath42 , @xmath43 this st - wham - muca algorithm is quite simple if one has @xmath40 .",
    "we can numerically evaluate the derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ eq : st - wham2 ] ) in a naive way , where the derivatives @xmath44 at energies @xmath45 follow from a linear regression around this point .",
    "for instance , we use a linear regression with @xmath46 points ; selecting @xmath47 points means that the derivative at @xmath45 is calculated with the values of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "we chose a value for @xmath47 according to the energy binsize @xmath19 . consequently , we calculate the derivatives in the energy range @xmath50 . in this method , it is more convenient to directly calculate the derivative of @xmath51 than the derivative of @xmath52 .",
    "we calculate the linear regression with a subroutine easily adapted from the linear fit subroutine in @xcite .",
    "another approach can be devised by considering an algorithm based on the cumulative distribution function ( cdf )  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such approach is that it avoids histogramming when describing probability densities @xmath53 , dismissing the need for any _ ad hoc _ energy discretisation .",
    "the method defines an estimator @xmath54 for the cdf @xmath55 , where the function @xmath54 is an empirical cumulative distribution function ( ecdf ) for the probability density @xmath53 .",
    "the algorithm sorts the energy time series of length ndat in an ascending order @xmath56 , so any outliers can be eliminated by constructing a restricted ecdf @xmath57 in the range between two meaningful points @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( in general one takes @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "the basic idea is to propose an approximating function @xmath62 to describe @xmath57 , from where the difference function is defined , @xmath63 this function can be expanded in fourier series , @xmath64 which gives the fourier coefficients @xcite , @xmath65 here we use the same criteria of  @xcite where the maximum number mmax of coefficients @xmath66 is obtained by imposing the two - sided kolmogorov test  @xcite .",
    "notably , eq .  ( [ eq : di ] ) provides all the information that one needs to obtain a parameter - free energy probability density @xmath53 .",
    "the reason is because eq .",
    "( [ eq : re - def ] ) yields a smooth estimate of the cdf given mmax coefficients in the fourier expansion , @xmath67 even if one assumes a linear _ ansatz _ for @xmath62 ( see @xcite ) . in turn",
    ", it becomes easy to obtain estimates for the probability density @xmath68 by differentiation , which consists in a smooth estimation of @xmath2 .",
    "now , let us go back to the numerical differentiation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : st - wham2 ] ) . to obtain parameter - free derivatives",
    "@xmath69 , we just need to differentiate @xmath57 again .",
    "this corresponds to the following numerical calculation , @xmath70 unlike the linear regression method , where we calculate the derivative of @xmath71 , here is more convenient to compute the derivative of @xmath2 directly .",
    "we have included in appendix the function derpd(x ) , which can be used to estimate this derivative from the fourier coefficients @xmath66 .",
    "one can easily incorporate this function in the program cdf_pd subroutine provided by berg and harris  @xcite .",
    "next we present our approach to implement a bayesian analysis . to this end , input data ( denoted by @xmath72 ) is the empirical cumulative distribution and not the histograms that are dependent on the energy binsize @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the aim is to describe the empirical cumulative distribution by a given model ( called model m ) and using the bayesian analysis @xcite , extract values for its parameters ( denoted by @xmath73 ) from the _ posterior _ probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath74 . here",
    ", @xmath75 denotes possible parameters related to the experimental conditions , which is the temperature in our numerical experiment , and @xmath76 refers to a set of observed experimental points @xmath77 . from the _",
    "posterior _ pdf , we extract the desired probability distributions for each parameter , @xmath78 which correspond to the marginalized distributions .",
    "these marginalized distributions are depicted with histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] for the ubiquitin .    for each protein ,",
    "our _ experimental _ data @xmath72 is produced by dividing the observed energy range into 35 points @xmath77 and _ experimental _ errors are extracted from the jackknife procedure .",
    "we anticipate here that these _ experimental _ data are displayed in figures [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:10 ] for the folding - unfolding transition of ubiquitin and for the aggregation of two fibonacci sequences , respectively . within a bayesian approach ,",
    "the set of observations @xmath79 is just a set among possible experimental outcomes @xmath72 at the points @xmath77 .",
    "thus , given a fixed model m and a set of experimental values @xmath80 , parameters estimation within bayesian approach is obtained as follows @xcite , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the _ prior _ distribution for a fixed model m.    since our aim is to characterise @xmath32 in a first - order phase transition region , we assume that the energy distribution @xmath53 ( _ i.e. _  a continuous estimate for @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : st - wham2 ] ) ) is well described by a double - peak function .",
    "this function characterises the coexistent phases at temperatures close enough to the transition temperature @xmath83 , whose shape is a consequence of the free - energy barrier between the ordered and disordered phases .",
    "therefore , the expected energy distribution @xmath53 can be written as a normalized sum of two gaussian distributions with peaks centered at energies @xmath84 and @xmath85 , corresponding to the disordered and ordered phases , respectively @xcite .",
    "if we assume the model m as the cumulative distribution function of @xmath53 , and recalling that for a gaussian distribution the cdf is the error function , we arrive to the following modelling , @xmath86 .",

    "this is a low number compared to the cdf method , which allows a variable number of parameters ( _ i.e. _ fourier coefficients ) defined depending on the demand of the ecdf .",
    "for instance , the cdf method needs 13 fourier coefficients to obtain probability densities for the ubiquitin data and this number goes up to 74 for fibonacci sequences .",
    "furthermore , model i was constructed on the hypothesis that the coexistence of two thermodynamic bulk phases can be well described by two gaussian distributions .",

    "<S> microcanonical thermostatistics analysis has become an important tool to reveal essential aspects of phase transitions in complex systems . an efficient way to estimate the microcanonical inverse temperature @xmath0 and the microcanonical entropy @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> is achieved with the statistical temperature weighted histogram analysis method ( st - wham ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of this method lies on its flexibility , as it can be used to analyse data produced by algorithms with generalised sampling weights . </S>",
    "<S> however , for any sampling weight , st - wham requires the calculation of derivatives of energy histograms @xmath2 , which leads to non - trivial and tedious binning tasks for models with continuous energy spectrum such as those for biomolecular and colloidal systems . here , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two alternative methods that avoid the need for such energy binning to obtain continuous estimates for @xmath2 in order to evaluate @xmath0 by using st - wham : ( i ) a series expansion to estimate probability densities from the empirical cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , and ( ii ) a bayesian approach to model this cdf . comparison with a simple linear regression method is also carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of these approaches is evaluated considering coarse - grained protein models for folding and peptide aggregation . </S>"
