    "in semiconductor heterostructures , and in an environment with an excess of electrons or holes , not only neutral excitons ( @xmath1 ) can be found but also negative or positively charged excitons , respectively .",
    "this happens because , under certain circumstances , excitons capture an extra charge to form the so called trions or charged excitons .",
    "thus , trions represent bound states of three particles : two electrons and a hole in the case of negatively charged excitons ( @xmath2 ) , and two holes and one electron in the case of positively charged excitons ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "bound complexes of three particles have a binding energy which is large enough to make them observable .",
    "the most broadly used experimental technique to investigate trions is the time - resolved photoluminescence @xcite .",
    "recently , generation and recombination processes of excitons and trions have been analyzed using this technique @xcite .",
    "photoluminescence has also been used to investigate two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a trion can be formed by  photoexcitation together with selectively doping to get the charge excess or , alternatively , only by injection or diffusion of electrons and holes .",
    "there are three ways to form trions in photoexcitation . directly , by the resonant excitation of trion electron level and the trapping of a second electron ( or hole ) .",
    "indirectly , either by the excitation of an electron - hole pair , followed by the formation of an exciton , or by resonant excitation of a neutral exciton . in the latter two cases the exciton , after its formation , is attached to an existing free electron ( or hole ) .",
    "the dynamics of the three processes are different @xcite .",
    "the other method involves the injection of electrons and holes by doping regions close to the structure .",
    "injection has the advantage of avoiding the interaction between the electromagnetic field associated with the photoexcitation and the excited electrons @xcite .",
    "spintronics has newly aroused great interest in the scientific community due to its promising future for creating circuits faster and more efficient than that existing in semiconductor devices .",
    "to paraphrase awschalom et al .",
    ", the reason is that the energy needed to generate and transport electron spins is much less than that necessary to create charge electron currents . in practice ,",
    "the main obstacle that faces spintronics is to produce polarized spin currents without loss of polarization during the process @xcite .",
    "one of the main properties of trions is precisely their influence on the polarization and duration of the electron spin in semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) and , thus , in spintronics @xcite . at zero magnetic field",
    "the ground state of the trion is a singlet , that is , the two electrons ( or holes ) have opposite spins . the trion triplet state , in which the two electrons ( holes ) have the same spin direction , is not bound at zero magnetic field .",
    "triplet state only becomes bound under finite magnetic fields . as mentioned above",
    ", the trion state consists of two charges belonging to the most abundant group and the remaining charge belonging to the minority of the total carrier concentration .",
    "both types of carriers may have two directions of angular momentum ( in a typical quantum well , @xmath4 for heavy holes and @xmath5 for electrons ) . in the singlet state the total angular momentum coincides with the angular momentum of the minority carriers , either holes in @xmath2 or electrons in @xmath3 .",
    "the triplet state is observed only in high magnetic fields or when the zeeman splitting is greater than the energy separation between singlet and triplet states @xcite . since its simplicity",
    ", the singlet state is particularly suitable for the study of the spin dynamics .    in the last years",
    "several works have considered photoexcitation and spin polarization in different semiconductor structures and under different resonance conditions .",
    "dynamic studies of spin polarization , including exciton and trion contributions , can be found in the literature 17,18,19,20 .",
    "some authors have reported the resonant photoexcitation at the exciton or trion electron levels is the suitable way to get the spin coherence during a reasonably long time to be used in spintronic devices , without the help of applied magnetic fields or tunneling from magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "others say it is better resonant photoexcitation of free electron level @xcite",
    ". however , still is open the question about the relation between resonance and efficiency . to be precise , what happen if the energy of photoexcitation resonates with the free electron level , the exciton level , or the trion level .",
    "if the excitation energy is in resonance with one level or another , the situation will be different .",
    "in this work we will compare the three choices just mentioned and show that the resonant free electron excitation leads to a higher spin polarization , by means of the intermediate contribution of excitons and trions .",
    "we will consider a long duration pulse to study its effect on the spin polarization .",
    "suppose we have a  quantum well doped in the left barrier , as fig",
    ". 1 shows . applying a suitable low electric field",
    "we can vary the relative position of the fermi level with respect to the ground level of the conduction well , controlling the electron density injected by tunneling into the well .",
    "when we photoexcite free electrons coherently , if the excitation pulse is long enough , free electrons will form excitons through the coulomb interaction with remaining holes .",
    "in addition , as the material is slightly doped with donors , the appearance of negative trions is an immediate consequence .",
    "note that , in quantum wells , the strong dipole - dipole repulsion between excitons prevents the formation of biexcitons .",
    "thus , contributions from these neutral species can be overlooked @xcite .",
    "thus , we deal with three different electronic states ( free , excitonic , and trionic electron ) which will occupy different energy levels .    while free electrons from doping have their spins randomly oriented , it does not happen the same for photoexcited electrons if illuminating with polarized light : photoexcited species have a dominant spin orientation controlled by the polarization of the photon .",
    "for example , applying a circularly polarized light @xmath6 , holes are spin up orientated whilst electrons are spin down @xcite .",
    "because of this preferred orientation one can achieve a net electron spin polarization for practical purposes .",
    "the aim of this paper is the theoretical analysis of the temporal evolution of the spin polarization for electrons when semiconductor qw is doped with different concentrations and photoexcited at different laser frequencies , corresponding to free electron , exciton or trion resonance . besides",
    ", we will analyze the duration of the spin polarization depending on the relationship between doping and photoexcitation energy density .",
    "we will consider all the possible processes of generation and annihilation of excitons , trions and free electrons .",
    "in general , we will not consider in detail the specific physical processes that lead to different relaxation times ( dyakonov - perel , elliott - yafet , bir - aronov - pikus mechanisms , and so on ) .",
    "these processes have been carefully analyzed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "therefore , we chose empirical relaxation times for the simplest case , where there are no external fields ( except a very low electric field necessary to inject the free electrons into the qw ) , inhomogeneities in the interfaces , interaction with the nuclear spin , etc .    we will show that , although the presence of trions is essential to preserve a reasonable spin polarization , photoexcitation of electrons at trion level is not necessary .",
    "we use the matrix density formalism , considering the different generation , recombination and annihilation rates for different types of binding energy and spin polarization @xcite .",
    "the effect of the interband optical pulse is included through the interband generation function .",
    "we will first consider the bloch equations for the general dynamics of the spin polarization for the different species .",
    "then , we will consider the three cases mentioned before , corresponding to the photoexcitation energy in resonance with free electron , exciton or trion level .",
    "we assume an ultrafast  @xmath7 injection of electrons from the doped region into the qw to simplify calculations , when the electronic level lays under the fermi level .",
    "this assumption can be removed if selective doping is deemed .",
    "we consider the excitation laser pulse by the function @xmath8 } ,   \\label{1}\\]]where @xmath9 is the pulse duration and @xmath10 is the front pulse duration .",
    "thus , for @xmath11 ps we have a square pulse and , for @xmath12 , the pulse in a gaussian - like one @xcite .",
    "we simulate a continuous regime excitation by a very long pulse with @xmath13 ps and @xmath14 ps . to consider a pulse starting at @xmath15 ps , we have introduced the shift @xmath16 .",
    "we first consider the general quantum kinetic equation for the density matrix operator @xmath17 , and for electrons placed in an electric field with frequency @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar } \\left [ \\left (   \\widehat{\\delta h_{t}}\\exp \\left ( -i\\omega t\\right ) + h.c.\\right ) , \\widehat{\\eta } ( t)\\right ] .",

    "\\label{5}\\]]with the phenomenological constant @xmath30 .",
    "this constant is the finite relaxation rate . here",
    "@xmath31 is the equilibrium density matrix when the second - order contributions to the response are taken into account .",
    "taking the basis @xmath32 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( 3 )  as a system of kinetic equations for @xmath33 , where we neglect non - diagonal terms if @xmath34 are larger than the collision relaxation and generation rates .",
    "thus , for the diagonal terms,@xmath35where @xmath36 is the photogeneration rate for the @xmath37 state , and @xmath38 is the collision integral rate . using the dipole approximation and the basis @xmath39 , with @xmath40 ( valence ) , @xmath41 ( conduction ) , we get@xmath42where @xmath43 are the electron densities in the valence and conduction bands . for the case",
    "in which there is only photoexcitation , terms @xmath44correspond to the collision - induced relaxation of population in the conduction and valence bands .",
    "if we define the detuning energy as @xmath45 , the interband generation rate can be expressed through@xmath46 ,   \\label{8}\\]]and @xmath47 is the interband velocity .",
    "we will use the reduced generation function @xmath48 where@xmath49 ^{2}\\tau _",
    "{ p}/\\hbar \\label{9}\\]]is the characteristic density of photoexcited charges ( for @xmath50 mev and @xmath13 ps , an excitation energy density of @xmath51 nj @xmath52 corresponds to a characteristic density of  @xmath53 @xmath52 in our structure ) .",
    "it is important to point out that for such a long pulse , a detuning energy of @xmath54 mev is enough to reach the maximum of the generation function @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "2 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , we will use this value in calculations .    since we will consider three photoexcitation cases",
    ", we will take into account three possibilities : @xmath56  corresponding to the laser energies @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) for free , excitonic and trionic electrons , which resonate with their respective levels @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the exciton or trion binding energy ( obviously @xmath63 ) .",
    "thus , we will have three generation functions @xmath64 depending on the level resonance .    in the previous presentation of the density matrix",
    "we have not consider the spin of the particles .",
    "let us do . to study the time evolution of the electron spin polarization ,",
    "we first perform expressions for the temporal evolution of free electron , hole , exciton , and negative trion densities , paying attention to their spin orientation .",
    "we will consider the three possible generation functions as well as all other processes of generation and annihilation of these species .",
    "we will also consider the spin flip of electrons and holes .",
    "then , we will particularize these expressions to the three cases under study .",
    "initially , free electrons are injected into the qw , through the left barrier , quasi - instantaneously and without any spin polarization .",
    "the probability of spin @xmath65 @xmath66 or @xmath67 @xmath68 is the same . applying a circularly polarized light @xmath6 with energy @xmath69 , electron - hole pairs",
    "are generated with the peculiarity that the hole angular momentum is @xmath70 @xmath71 and that of the electron is @xmath67 @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "since the spin flip time of the holes is very small in comparison with the duration times of the remaining involved events , holes with angular momentum @xmath73 @xmath74 almost immediately appear . as the time of spin",
    "flip of electrons is several orders of magnitude greatest than the rest of processes , it will only affect to the behavior of the system at very long times .",
    "nevertheless we will include it in our calculations .",
    "the coulomb interaction between electrons ( injected or photoexcited ) and holes creates the exciton because the binding energy reduces the energy of the system , leading to a more stable state",
    ". initially all the holes , which have angular momentum @xmath75 , will join to electrons @xmath76 to give rise to excitonic bosons with angular momentum @xmath77 @xmath78 . almost simultaneously , given the fast spin flip of the photoexcited holes , holes @xmath73 @xmath74 and electrons @xmath65 @xmath79 give rise to excitons with angular momentum @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
    "we consider that nonoptical active excitons with the same orientation of electron and hole spins can not be photoexcited or recombined .",
    "inclusion of these cases in the bloch equations would lead to nonsense results .",
    "the interaction of excitons with the remaining low - density electron gas leads to the formation of trions .",
    "excitons @xmath82 in which the electron has spin @xmath76 , together with free electrons of spin @xmath83 , form trions ( and conversely for the other orientation ) .",
    "the angular momentum of these trions @xmath84 coincides with the corresponding angular momentum of holes , because the electron spins are compensated each other .",
    "another possibility is the direct formation of trions by the coulomb interaction between electrons and holes without intermediary pseudoparticles .",
    "the choices for angular momentum of these trions are the same already mentioned .",
    "when the circularly polarized light @xmath6 has energy @xmath85 , excitons are directly generated , with the same angular momentum presented before , @xmath77 @xmath78 with hole angular momentum of @xmath70 @xmath71 and electron angular momentum of @xmath67 @xmath72 . as in the former example",
    ", these excitons can produce trions @xmath70 @xmath86 through their interaction with free electrons @xmath65 @xmath66 .    and ,",
    "in the last case , when the energy of the polarized light resonates with the trion level , @xmath87 , the @xmath70 @xmath86 trions are generated by the capture of free electrons @xmath65 @xmath88 .",
    "the above mentioned mechanisms take some time expressed through the generation rates @xmath89 ,",
    "@xmath90 , and @xmath91 . the inverse of the mean time needed for exciton formation is @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the trion formation rate via three - particle processes : two free electrons and a hole for negative trion . and @xmath92is the trion formation rate through two - particle interaction : an exciton plus a free electron .    about the disappearance of the mentioned species , we will consider three mechanisms .",
    "first , the direct recombination of a free electron with a hole .",
    "second , the recombination of an electron and a hole within an exciton , as well as the dissociation of the exciton resulting in an electron and a hole . and third , the recombination of an electron with a hole within a trion leaving free the other electron , together with the dissociation of a trion in two or three particles . in the following expressions , @xmath93 is the radiative recombination coefficient of free carriers , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the inverse of the intrinsic exciton and trion lifetimes , respectively .",
    "dissociation rates for both excitons and trions are so small that neglecting their effect do not change results ( appendix a ) .",
    "moreover , electrons lose their free condition when producing excitons and trions . so the generation rates @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91contribute also as three additional mechanisms for free electron extinction .",
    "further , trion annihilation gives rise to free electrons because the recombination of one electron with the hole leaves an extra free electron .",
    "thus , we have another generation term for free electrons at a rate @xmath95 .",
    "we also define @xmath96 and @xmath97 as the spin flip rate for electrons and holes , respectively .    by writing densities of free electrons , holes , excitons , and negative trions in units of @xmath98 [ @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively ] we project over the two spin states .",

    "this space - charge potential is repulsive for holes and attractive for electrons . at low densities ,",
    "electron - hole attraction dominates over electron - electron and hole - hole repulsion .",
    "when the carrier density increases , the repulsive part of the hartree - fock potential energy increases as well",

    "to standardize equations , we take a referral density @xmath116 as normalization constant for @xmath117  at any case . then , in a first case ( a ) we consider this referral density equal to the photoexcited electron and the injected electron densities @xmath118 this situation is reflected in the initial boundary conditions stating @xmath119 in @xmath116 units . in a second case ( b ) we keep the same doping @xmath120  and use a @xmath98 ten times bigger than the used before @xmath121 , which corresponds to an excitation energy density ten times higher , approximately .",
    "the initial boundary conditions do not change . in a last case ( c ) we return to the first photoexcited electron density @xmath122 but reduce the injected electron density @xmath123 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we calculate the electron spin relative polarization defined as the difference between spin down and spin up free electron concentrations divided by their sum , @xmath127 .    finally , we compare temporal evolution of normalized densities @xmath117 and electron spin relative polarization @xmath128 , for the three above mentioned cases of photoexcitation and doping ( a , b and c ) , when resonant photoexcited level corresponds to free , exciton or trion electron energy level ( cases 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "the spin polarization of the free electron gas takes place essentially by the proper photoexcitation , because @xmath6 polarized light generates spin down but not spin up electrons .",
    "first , we will analyze the role that play the different processes on the net polarization for the case ( a ) . in the hypothetical case in which only doping and photoexcitation coexist , without any other process ,",
    "spin up electron concentration would remain constant , whereas spin down electron concentration linearly increases while the pulse is present ( fig .",
    "3a ) , which would produce certain polarization ` per se ' .",
    "these spin down and spin up electron concentrations will be slightly affected by the inclusion of the free electron - hole recombination along with the rapid flip of the hole spin ( fig .",
    "3b ) . they will change most appreciably for a realistic case , when all the different processes of bimolecular creation and destruction of excitons ( fig .",
    "3c ) or excitons and trions ( fig .",
    "3d ) are included .",
    "the holes generated during the photoexcitation have spin up but , since the hole flipping time is very short , it is possible to consider a similar number of holes with spin up or down .",
    "however , due to the very slow flip of the electron spin , the density of spin down electrons @xmath129 is greater because of the light polarization . as a consequence of its higher density ,",
    "free electron recombination is greater for these spin down electrons .",
    "this could be explained by considering the situation where spin up free holes @xmath71 can find easier this kind of free electrons @xmath72 to recombine with  ( fig .",
    "3b ) .    for the same reason , the disappearance of up and down electrons during the exciton formation process",
    "is not balanced : spin down electrons form more excitons @xmath78 than the others .",
    "thus , a clear decrease of spin down electron @xmath72 density , bigger than the corresponding for spin up electrons , can be observed by comparing fig .",
    "3c with fig .",
    "3b . on the other hand ,",
    "the recombination of excitons is independent of the relative concentration for any spin orientation because each electron in exciton is associated to a hole and its recombination does not depend on others .",
    "moreover , exciton recombination does not influence both spin electron densities .",
    "since both electrons in trion have different spin orientation , three particle trion formation leads to a balanced up and down electron quenching . when the formation of trions arises from excitons ,",
    "there are two possibilities : excitons @xmath78 together with spin up electrons @xmath66 to give trions @xmath130 or excitons @xmath131 with spin down electrons @xmath72 to give trions @xmath132 . as we mentioned above , there are a greater amount of these electrons @xmath72 and of the former excitons @xmath78 , leading to a balanced formation of trions with both spin orientations .",
    "thus , electrons with both spin orientation disappear at a similar rate . moreover , as the spin of electrons in trion is compensated , the spin of the hole in trion is able to flip and so , we can find trions with spin up and down with almost the same probability . the same reasoning for exciton recombination applies to trions recombination . in this case",
    ", the recombination of the electron - hole pair in trion frees an electron , whose spin orientation is equiprobable due to the similar density of the two kind of trions . in order to show all these behaviors",
    "we have added fig .",
    "4 , which corresponds to a magnified version of fig .",
    "3d , with the curves split for the different spin orientations for holes , excitons , and trions .",
    "the resulting relative polarization @xmath128 will reflect all the changes above reported . in fig .",
    "5 we show the polarization calculated for each case included in fig .",
    "3 . thus , in the case depicted in fig .",
    "3a , @xmath133 increases linearly along the pulse duration giving the largest difference of densities @xmath134 .",
    "however , the relative polarization is not the best because also the total amount of electrons @xmath135 is the biggest .",
    "the inclusion of the free electron- hole recombination is not very noticeable in the concentrations behavior ( fig 3b ) but it affects to the polarization leading to the lowest values .",
    "polarization increases when the different processes of creation and annihilation of excitons are included ( corresponding to fig .",
    "3c ) ,  because the total density of electrons with different spins is lower .  and",
    "so , when also creation and destruction of trions are considered ( fig 3d ) , the relative polarization reaches their greatest values .",
    "the influence of the photoexcitation energy density and the doping on the different species normalized densities can be seen in fig .",
    "6 , where we compare the three cases mentioned before : ( a ) with @xmath136 @xmath116 , ( b ) with @xmath137 , @xmath105 @xmath138 , and ( c ) with @xmath139 , @xmath105 @xmath140 . in the upper panel",
    "we represent case ( a ) , which corresponds to case considered in the former figs .",
    "the middle panel displays case ( b ) , where the same doping as in ( a ) but ten times bigger characteristic photoexcitation density leads to a considerable increase of excitons @xmath78 , whose density even exceeds that of the electrons @xmath72 . now there is also a significant trion concentration .",
    "the lower panel shows the last case ( c ) , where photoexcitation energy density goes back to the value of ( a ) , but doping is ten times lower .",
    "although the relation between @xmath98 and @xmath105 recovers the previous case ( @xmath141 ) , the behavior of normalized densities @xmath117 is clearly different . in this case",
    ", the bigger influence of the photoexcitation leads to a big increase on the relative density of spin down electrons @xmath72 and spin up holes @xmath142 now , the exciton @xmath143 formation is not as faster as in ( b ) and a greater variation in densities of spin up and spin down electrons is obtained . as in ( a ) , trion density is practically negligible .",
    "7 displays the resulting relative polarization for the three cases considered .",
    "one can see the clear improvement of the electron spin polarization when characteristic photoexcitation density exceeds doping density ( @xmath141 , cases b and c ) . moreover , relative polarization is better when increasing @xmath98 ( b ) than when diminishing @xmath105 ( c ) .",
    "when excitons are photoexcited resonantly @xcite , the only free electrons that exist are those from the doped region ( this is only strictly true at low temperatures ; if the temperature increases electrons and holes preferred free carriers position ) . moreover , because of all the holes are bound in excitons , there are not free holes . due to the circularly polarized light @xmath6 ,",
    "photoexcited excitons are @xmath144 and their only alternative to form trions is to join spin up free electrons @xmath66  from the doping , leading initiallyto specific trions @xmath86 .",
    "but , because of the fast spin flip of the hole in trion we will find , after several picoseconds , balanced densities for trions @xmath86 and @xmath145 .",
    "thus , the recombination of an electron - hole pair in these trions will leave spin up and spin down electrons with the same probability . in this case , since there are not free holes to bind with free electrons from doping , there is not the possibility of having excitons @xmath131 ; there will exist only photoexcited @xmath78 ones .    fig .",
    "8 shows the density time evolution for the different species and for the same three cases of fig .",
    "as expected , resonance with free electron or exciton level leads to a faster increase of the relative density of spin down electrons @xmath72 or excitons @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "the difference between the two kinds of resonant photoexcitation is more obvious in lower panels ( b and c ) , when @xmath141 . by comparing upper panel ( corresponding to case a ) in both figures , a smaller difference between spin up and down free electron densities",
    "can be seen for this exciton resonance case .",
    "this is more evident as we go through cases b and c. accordingly , this kind of resonant photoexcitation does not present any improvement for spin polarization . fig .",
    "9 depicts the relative electron spin polarization , showing a clear improvement when increasing the photoexcitation energy density ( case b ) , as it occurred formerly ( fig .",
    "however , for the other cases ( a and c ) , spin polarization does not increase as much as when light resonated with free electrons .",
    "finally , we analyze the case of resonant photoexcitation with the trion level . in this case , trions @xmath86 are directly generated by means of the capture of free electrons @xmath79 and without exciton intervention @xcite . as in the previous case ,",
    "the unique free electrons we have are the injected ones , and there are not free holes .",
    "so , as there are not free holes to join injected free electrons , there is not the possibility of having excitons at all .",
    "we will find just photoexcited trions and free electrons .",
    "the circularly polarized light @xmath6 initially  photoexcites specific trions @xmath130 and , due to the fast spin flip of the hole in trion , we will have balanced densities for trions @xmath86 and @xmath132 , as in the exciton resonant case .",
    "10 presents the evolution of the normalized density for the threesituations under study . due to the balanced densities of the two orientations , trions @xmath86 and @xmath147 , we have drawn the sum of both curves in only one . while in the first case ( a ) behavior is very similar to the former ones ( figs . 6 and 8) , does not happen the same when @xmath141 ( b and c ) . in case",
    "( b ) , with @xmath137 , @xmath105 @xmath138 , we can see a fast increase of the relative density of trions , as expected for the photoexcited species but it is clearly less than that shown in figs .",
    "the reason is that now , to generate trions , there must be free electrons available to be captured . since the only electrons we have came from the injected from the doped region , this electron density determines the possible photoexcited trion density . also , because only up free electrons @xmath66 are captured during photoexcitation , the density of these electrons drastically decreases .",
    "however , trion recombination leaves a compensated density of  up and down free electrons .    for @xmath139 , @xmath105 @xmath140 ( c ) , differences are more remarkable among this and the two other cases ( figs . 6 and 8) .",
    "low panel in fig .",
    "10 looks like the upper one , except for the density axis .",
    "the key is that , now , doping is very low and limits trion generation .",
    "thus , in this case we do not find a significative improvement on the density of photoexcited species .",
    "11 shows electron spin relative polarization for the three situations under study , and when photoexciting in resonance with trion level .",
    "as expected , curves coincide for cases a and c. by comparing this figure with figs . 7 and 9",
    ", we can note that , in the present case , spin polarization is substantially worse than in the others , being free electron resonant photoexcitation which leads to the best results .",
    "first , we should mention here the approximations used in the method of calculation . we assume injection as a tunneling process much shorter than all the other processes involved .",
    "thus , we include doping in the initial conditions as prior to photoexcitation .",
    "an important point is the possible effect of the application of external electric fields on trion and electron orientation .",
    "we used field strengths less than 10 kv / cm to prevent the possible ionization or diffusion of trion through the structure @xcite .",
    "higher external fields can affect spin relaxation times through the elliott ",
    "yafet mechanism @xcite .",
    "the fact that excitonic and trionic electron levels are very close in energy , less than @xmath148 mev in the gaas @xcite , should be reflected in a nonzero trion generation rate when excitons are photoexcited .",
    "thus , a few electrons should be generated in the corresponding state . in the present study",
    "the amount of these electrons is negligible because the long pulse leads to a narrow energy dispersion . in this way we have only considered trions formed by means of excitons and free electrons because direct trion generation by resonant exciton photoexcitation can be neglected .",
    "we have used in numerical calculations the eight - coupled bloch system obtained from the kinetic equation for the one - electron density matrix , projected over the spin states , and taking into account eight possible time - dependent processes .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the temporal behavior of the density of free electrons , excitons and trions in doped qws when they are photoexcited with @xmath6 circularly polarized light .",
    "we pay special attention to the electron spin orientation when the sample has different doping concentrations and is subjected to different photoexcitation energy densities .",
    "we have considered three cases of resonant photoexcitation corresponding to the three lower conduction electronic levels ( free , excitonic and trionic electrons ) .",
    "also , we have studied the electron spin relative polarization considering the role played by excitons and trions .",
    "our main conclusion is that , for practical purposes , photoexcitation of free electron level leads to a higher spin polarization .",
    "another important point is the relationship between the characteristic photoexcitation density ( directly related to the photoexcitation energy density ) and doping density .",
    "the effect of both variables on the spin polarization is opposite , being significantly more pronounced for the first one .",
    "thus , we have found that increasing photoexcitation enhances spin polarization while this improvement can be achieved by reducing the doping .",
    "our results show a wide variety of responses , caused by the different carrier densities of free and bound electrons and different photoexcitation energy densities .",
    "present results can be checked by means of photoluminescence measures .",
    "photoluminescence experiments of spin density in @xmath0-type gaas - gaalas qws are available 33 . this work can be applied to any spin relaxation mechanism and other structures by changing the parameters involved .",
    "we expect that this work will aid in the design of the experimental conditions to study electron spin dynamics , as well as in stimulating research in this field .",
    "let us check coefficients involved in the mechanisms with which we have been working on : formation ( @xmath149 ) , dissociation ( @xmath150 ) , and recombination ( @xmath151 ) of excitons and trions .",
    "essentially , we have followed the approach of berney et al .",
    "@xcite , specifying as far as possible to our structure and @xmath152 k. thus , we can outline processes as follows:@xmath153we first consider the formation coefficients , which depend on carrier and the lattice temperatures , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively . for the exciton coefficient @xmath156",
    "we have extrapolated a value of @xmath157 @xmath158ps@xmath126 from fig . 1 in the paper of berney et al",
    ". considering  our coefficient @xmath159 , we obtain a rate of @xmath160 ps@xmath126 . in order to estimate bi- and tri - molecular trion formation coefficients we have followed fig .",
    "2 of the same paper , obtaining @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath158ps@xmath126and @xmath163 @xmath164ps@xmath126 .",
    "thus , formation rate coefficients we have used for trion formation are @xmath165 @xmath166 ps@xmath126 and @xmath167 @xmath166 ps@xmath126 .",
    "coefficients @xmath150 have been calculated using the saha - eggert equations . in the case that concerns us ,",
    "saha - eggert relations can be written as@xmath168where @xmath169 mev and @xmath170 mev are the binding energy for exciton and trion , respectively @xcite .",
    "here @xmath171 , @xmath172where @xmath173 , @xmath174 are the electron and hole effective masses .",
    "thus , we have obtained @xmath175 @xmath52 , @xmath176@xmath52 , and @xmath177@xmath178 .",
    "dissociation coefficients will be @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 , which numerical values are @xmath182 ps@xmath126 , @xmath183 ps@xmath126 , and @xmath184 ps@xmath126 .    as we can see",
    ", the dissociation rates obtained are negligible compared with the formation and recombination rates .",
    "therefore , we have neglected the dissociation coefficients in the system of equations ( 10 - 13 ) because they do not bring any noticeable change in the results .",
    "let us consider the radiative decay times for excitons and trions , which are the inverse of the recombination coefficients @xmath151 .",
    "as the above coefficients , recombination rates also depend on carrier temperature @xcite .",
    "values for our structure and conditions are @xmath185 @xmath166 ps@xmath126 and @xmath186 @xmath166 ps@xmath126 for exciton and trion , respectively .",
    "now , we will consider  free electron - hole radiative recombination . unlike exciton or trion recombination rates , which do not directly depend on their concentrations , free electron recombination does .",
    "free electron must find a free hole to recombine while these charges are already bound in exciton and trion .",
    "following szczytko et al .",
    "@xcite , the bimolecular plasma recombination rate will be @xmath187 @xmath158ps@xmath126 and the radiative recombination coefficient of free carriers , @xmath188 ps@xmath126 .",
    "finally , electron spin relaxation time was taken from dzhioev et al .",
    "@xcite , which empirically obtained a value of @xmath189 ns for a structure and conditions similar to ours . about holes",
    ", we have used the spin flip time obtained by schneider et al .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath190 ps .",
    "thus , the spin relaxation coefficients included in calculations are @xmath191 ps@xmath126 for electrons and @xmath192 @xmath193 ps@xmath126 for holes .",
