    "ngc891 is a bright , non - interacting spiral galaxy ( sa(s)b : de vaucouleurs et al .  1976 ) .",
    "it is very nearly edge - on ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; sofue @xmath3 nakai 1993 ) .",
    "ngc  891 is one of the major members of the ngc1023 group and its distance is estimated to be 9.5mpc for @xmath4 , making for a scale of 22@xmath5/kpc or 46pc/@xmath5 .",
    "many authors have remarked on the apparent similarity between ngc  891 and the milky way .",
    "the interstellar medium in the disk of ngc  891 has been the subject of several studies , notably radio continuum ( allen et al . 1978 ; sukumar @xmath3 allen 1991 ) , hi ( sancisi @xmath3 allen 1979 ; rupen 1991 ) , dust ( howk @xmath3 savage 1997 ) ; co ( garca - burillo et al . 1992 ; scoville et al . 1993 ; sofue @xmath3 nakai 1993 ; garca - burillo @xmath3 gulin 1995 ; sakamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) and ci ( gerin @xmath3 phillips 1997 ) .",
    "far - infrared dust emission was observed by iras ( see wainscoat et al .",
    "1987 ; rice et al . 1988 ) , and at @xmath6 = 1.3 mm by gulin et al . 1993 . in this paper",
    "we present further observations of the submillimeter dust emission from ngc  891 with the new scuba submillimeter continuum array detector .",
    "the scuba 850 and 450 @xmath0 m images were obtained in 1997 september on the jcmt .",
    "scuba employs two arrays of cooled bolometers , each covering a field of about @xmath7 .",
    "the respective filters used have central frequencies of 347 ghz and 677 ghz respectively ; both filters have a bandwidth of 30 ghz .",
    "we observed three fields on ngc  891 ( center , northeast and southwest ) in socalled ` jiggle - mode ' in order to cover the whole galaxy .",
    "chopping distance was 2@xmath8 perpendicular to the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "total integration time for the three fields was 128 minutes .",
    "reduction was performed in the standard manner .",
    "photometric calibration was achieved by skydip analysis and mapping of the standard star crl 618 .",
    "more complete details of the instrument as well as observing and reduction methods can be found in holland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and jenness et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , as well as on the world - wide web ( www.jach.hawaii.edu ) .",
    "the resulting images are shown in figure 1 . especially in the 450@xmath0 m image ,",
    "residual noise is seen at the scuba field edges ; this should be discounted .",
    "gulin et al . ( 1993 ) have fitted two dust components at 15 k and 30 k to their 1.3 mm flux and the iras 100@xmath0 m flux . from our maps , we have determined integrated flux - densities @xmath9 = 4.8@xmath100.6 jy and @xmath11 jy . the observations through the 850@xmath0 m filter include emission from the @xmath12=32 @xmath13co line . in similar beams ,",
    "the first three co transitions occur in intensity ratios of 1:0.75:0.4 ( see garca - burillo et al .",
    "1992 ; gerin @xmath3 phillips 1997 ) . from this",
    ", we estimate an integrated @xmath12=32 co contribution of 0.22 jy to the measured 850@xmath0 m flux - density . corrected for this contribution , the dust continuum emission becomes @xmath14 4.6 jy .",
    "the @xmath12=65 @xmath13co transition is at the edge of the 450@xmath0 m filter ; we expect its contribution to the observed flux to be negligible .",
    "with @xmath15 = 0.73 jy ( gulin et al . 1993 ) , and the iras flux densities @xmath16 = 6 jy , @xmath17 = 7 jy , @xmath18 = 80 jy and @xmath19 = 196 jy ( wainscoat et al . 1987 ; rice et al . 1988 ; young et al .",
    "1989 ) , the infrared / submillimeter spectrum of ngc  891 is now well - determined .    assuming a dust emissivity proportional to @xmath20",
    ", we have fitted these flux - densities with various dust temperatures .",
    "longwards of 100@xmath0 m , a good fit is obtained with a _",
    "single _ dust temperature @xmath21 21 k. however , this fit leaves the mid - infrared fluxes and most of the 60@xmath0 m flux to be explained .",
    "the interstellar dust models by dsert , boulanger @xmath3 puget ( 1990 ) suggest that virtually all of the 12@xmath0 m flux and about 50@xmath22 of the 25@xmath0 m flux is attributable to pah particles .",
    "this implies a ratio @xmath23 = 0.1 for the remaining very - small grain ( vsg ) component which suggests an average vsg size somewhat larger than in the solar neighbourhood , i.e. about 10 nm instead of 7 nm ( see dsert et al .",
    "we have used equation ( 2 ) from gulin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to calculate the total hydrogen mass associated with the radiating dust ( assuming @xmath24 = 1.6 ) and find @xmath25 m@xmath26 .",
    "next , we assume that the 12 - 1300 @xmath0 m spectrum is described by the dust model of dsert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , with big - grain dust radiating at two different temperatures . with dust temperatures @xmath27",
    "= 28@xmath102 k and @xmath28 =",
    "18@xmath101 k , close to the values assumed by gulin et al . ( 1993 ) , calculated fluxes reproduce the observed values to better than 20@xmath22 over the full wavelength range . at 850@xmath0 m",
    ", we find flux - densities of 1.2 jy ( vsg ) , 0.55@xmath100.15 jy ( warm dust ) and 3.1@xmath100.2 jy ( cold dust ) . from this",
    ", we obtain @xmath29 m@xmath26 and @xmath30 m@xmath26 , or a total mass @xmath31 m@xmath26 , slightly less than that estimated by gulin et al .",
    "the ratio @xmath32 is higher than surmised by gulin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    because the dust emission is a strong function of temperature ,",
    "the temperatures are relatively well - determined , depending on the choice of one or two temperature components .",
    "as is clear from the above , the choice of temperature model has relatrively little effect on the derived mass .",
    "following gulin et al ( 1993 ) , we adopt @xmath33 m@xmath26 so that @xmath34 m@xmath26 .",
    "this yields a conversion factor @xmath35 mol @xmath36 @xmath37 , somewhat less than found by gulin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and gerin @xmath3 phillips ( 1997 ) and substantially less than the canonical value .",
    "assuming @xmath38 ( allen @xmath3 sancisi , 1979 ; rupen 1991 ) and all h@xmath39 to be sampled , the overall ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen is 0.38 , the molecular gas fraction is 0.20 and within @xmath40 kpc , the total gas fraction , including helium , is 5% .",
    "the first two values are similar to those found for the milky way and for dwarf irregular galaxies ( israel 1997 ) .",
    "the structure of co and dust continuum emission along the major axis can be roughly described by three components : the very compact central source at ( a circumnuclear disk  garca - burillo et al .",
    "1992 ; scoville et al . 1993 ; sofue @xmath3 nakai 1993 ) , a ` molecular ring ' between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( 2  6 kpc ) and the extended disk traceable out to @xmath43 ( 9 kpc ) . given the edge - on configuration of ngc  891 , the various peaks in the emission are most likely spiral arms seen tangentially .",
    "this includes the bright inner peaks which may well be due to bright spiral arms encircling the bulge rather than a ring .",
    "as figure 1 shows , the 850@xmath0 m ( and 450@xmath0 m ) continuum image is virtually identical to the @xmath12=10 co image .",
    "this is in line with the close resemblance of the 1.3 mm to the @xmath12=21 @xmath13co distribution ( gulin et al .",
    "1993 ) and indeed to the @xmath44 ci distribution ( gerin @xmath3 phillips 1997 ) and the 6 cm continuum emission ( see allen et al .",
    "this is further illustrated by the radial distributions shown in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2c shows @xmath12=10 co/850@xmath0 m emission ratios of 1500 for the central peak and 2000 for the molecular ring peaks ( or inner spiral arm tangential points ) , dropping to 1300 for the inner region inside the ` ring ' .",
    "although decreasing signal - to - noise ratios introduce increasingly large relative errors in the outer disk ratios , there appears to be a steady decrease in this ratio , in the outer disk dropping to 70@xmath22 of the value at @xmath45 , just outside the molecular ring .",
    "the run of the 450/850/1300 @xmath0 m intensities with radius provides no support for significant dust temperature gradients .",
    "we propose that the high ratio of the molecular ring primarily reflects a higher co surface filling factor .",
    "if the inner spiral arms contain a rich population of dense co clouds , this will quite naturally produce a relatively high co filling factor ( hence a high ratio in figure 2c ) at the arm tangential points .",
    "high line - of - sight co optical depths are suggested by the @xmath13co/@xmath46co ratio of 2.5 for the ring ( sakamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the decrease of the co/850@xmath0 m ratio with increasing distance to the center parallels the radial drop in co emissivity shown by scoville et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and the even steeper decrease of @xmath46co emission ( sakamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , resulting in a @xmath13co/@xmath46co gradient increasing from 5 just outside the molecular ring to about 15 in the outer disk .",
    "the latter interpret this as a steep radial decrease of the dense gas fraction , so that we may expect the effects of photo - dissociation processes to increase radially .",
    "this appears to be confirmed by the observed major axis distributions of [ ci ] ( gerin @xmath3 phillips 1997 ) and [ cii ] ( madden et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the central region is quite different .",
    "virtually all major axis profiles exhibit a pronounced dip inside the molecular ring , onto which the compact emission from the circumnuclear disk is superposed .",
    "this suggests that the region _ inside the molecular ring _ , i.e. the region within @xmath47 = 2 kpc corresponding to the bulge of ngc  891 , contains _ little _ interstellar material except for the circumnuclear disk of radius 600 pc .",
    "the emission observed towards the center mostly represents material in the molecular ring with a smaller contribution from the outer disk .",
    "the cavity appears to be filled by very hot ( @xmath48 k ) x - ray - emitting gas , extending into the molecular ring ( bregman @xmath3 pildis 1994 ) . west of the nucleus",
    ", an x - ray jet feature is seen .",
    "this , and the presence of a nuclear disk suggests that ngc  891 has a mildly active nucleus . we have attempted to separate the nuclear continuum emission peak from the more extended emission .",
    "we find fluxes @xmath15 = 55 mjy , @xmath9 = 230 mjy and @xmath49 = 2200 mjy .",
    "corrected for co line contributions ( garca - burillo et al . 1992 ; gerin @xmath3 phillips 1997 ) , these reduce to 40 , 190 and 2200 mjy respectively .",
    "although these fluxes are relatively uncertain , they define a spectrum considerably steeper than that of the galaxy as a whole . if all dust radiates at the same temperature , we find @xmath50 , at least twice as high as the whole galaxy under the same assumption .",
    "a similar temperature ( @xmath51 40 k was derived by sakamoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the molecular gas in the nuclear disk .",
    "we have mapped the submillimetre emission from the edge - on galaxy ngc  891 at wavelengths of 850@xmath0 m and 450@xmath0 m .",
    "the appearance of both maps is very similar to those obtained by others at 1300@xmath0 m and in the @xmath13co line .",
    "the integrated infrared spectrum of ngc  891 shortwards of 100@xmath0 m is dominated by emission from pah particles and very small dust grains .",
    "longwards of 100@xmath0 m emission from large dust grains dominates .",
    "the emission spectrum between 100@xmath0 m and 1300@xmath0 m can be fitted equally well by a single population of grains at a temperature of 20 k , or a bimodal population of grains at temperatures of 18 k and 27 k. in either case , we find a total hydrogen mass of the order of 3@xmath52 m@xmath26 , somewhat less than estimated by gulin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , but close enough to be consistent . as a consequence ,",
    "we confirm their conclusion that the co - to - h@xmath39 conversion ratio in ngc  891 is substantially less ( by a factor of 2  4 ) than the canonical values frequently used .",
    "the distribution of the various ism components as a function of distance to the center of the galaxy of these ism components can be described as roughly gaussian , with a strong central peak and several lesser peaks in the disk superposed .",
    "the central peak originates in a compact circumnuclear disk ( @xmath53 or 0.7 kpc ; see garca - burillo et al .",
    "1992 ; scoville et al .",
    "the compact circumnuclear disk is embedded in soft x - ray emission and is at a temperature of at least 40 k , and probably significantly higher .",
    "the lesser peaks probably mark spiral arms seen tangentially .",
    "although the submillimetre continuum emission from dust and the line emissions from co and ci show very similar distributions , their intensity ratios vary across the galaxy . towards the central region co and especially ci are relatively weak compared to the dust emission at 850@xmath0 m . in the socalled ` molecular ring ' we find the reverse : co and ci are relatively strong . at greater distances to the center ,",
    "the co to dust emission ratio decreases , whereas the ci to dust emission ratio increases .",
    "this behaviour may be explained by an ` empty ' bulge region , by greater co and ci surface filling factors in tangential spiral arms , and by an increase in photo - dissociation effects at greater radial distances due to an increasing paucity of dense molecular clouds .",
