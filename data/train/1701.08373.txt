    "various wireless communication setups can be modeled as interference channels consisting of multiple coexisting transmitter - receiver pairs . to reduce the interference in such systems , there are mainly two categories of receiver structures [ 1]-[2 ] .",
    "the first category are maximum likelihood ( ml)-based receivers achieving the highest possible rates [ 1 ] . however , the ml - based estimation may be practically infeasible , as the size of the search space grows exponentially with the codeword length , the number of antennas , and the number of transmitters [ 1 ] .",
    "the second category are linear receivers ( lr ) which have low complexity in filtering the received signals through a linear structure for decoding .",
    "lrs are often proposed based on the criteria of zero - forcing ( zf ) and minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) [ 1]-[4 ] .",
    "recently , a novel linear receiver referred to as integer - forcing linear receiver ( iflr ) has been designed to simultaneously recover the transmitted messages in point - to - point multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems [ 5 ] .",
    "this idea was derived from the compute - and - forward scheme [ 6 ] .",
    "based on noisy linear combinations of the transmitted messages , iflr recovers independent equations of messages through a linear receiver structure . in this way ,",
    "in contrast to mmse and zf schemes , instead of combating , iflr exploits the interference for a higher throughput .",
    "application of the iflr scheme in mimo multi - pair two - way relaying is proposed in [ 7 ] .",
    "it is shown in [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] that precoding in iflr can achieve the full diversity and the capacity of gaussian mimo channels up to a gap , respectively .",
    "also , [ 10 ] applies successive decoding in iflr and proves its sum rate optimality .",
    "iflr recovers all desirable and undesirable transmitted messages by decoding sufficient number of the best independent equations in terms of achievable rate .",
    "hence , considering iflr in interference networks , the complexity of the lattice decoding and also the best equation selection process grows considerably with the number of transmitters and data streams .",
    "the combination of iflr and interference alignment [ 11 ] , referred to as integer - forcing interference alignment ( ifia ) , is proposed in [ 12 ] to decode sufficient equations to recover the desirable messages .",
    "however , ifia requires channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) .",
    "this is the motivation for our paper in which we design an efficient low - complexity receiver for interference channels with no need for csit .    here",
    ", we propose a linear receiver scheme , referred to as integer - forcing message recovering ( ifmr ) , for interference networks . benefiting from a special equation structure of iflr",
    ", we propose a novel receiver model in which the required number of decodings is limited to twice the number of desirable messages . in our ifmr , independent integer combinations of the desirable messages are recovered in each receiver .",
    "each integer combination , referred to as desirable combined message ( dcm ) , is recovered by decoding two independent equations . here , with a new formulation , the equations can be optimized such that a dcm is recovered with maximum achievable rate . despite of its much less complexity , we prove that our sequential approach in optimizing dcms achieves the same rate as the optimal approach when we can jointly optimize dcms ( theorem 1 ) .    instead of np hard exhaustive search in optimizing the equations of ifmr , we present a practical and efficient suboptimal algorithm to maximize the achievable rate in polynomial time",
    ". the proposed algorithm iterates in three steps , one for the coefficient factors of the two equations and the others for the coefficient vectors of an undesirable combined message ( ucm ) and dcm .",
    "the associated problem with each step is solved in polynomial time .",
    "the convergence of the proposed algorithm is also proved ( theorem 3 ) .",
    "hence , our ifmr scheme provides a low - complexity scheme in recovering the desirable messages through a few decodings of near - optimal integer combinations in interference channels .",
    "our scheme is different and much less complex compared to the iflr scheme that uses a large number of equations for message recovery .",
    "particularly , the complexity of ifmr does not depend on the number of transmitters and the data streams of the interfering transmitters .",
    "also , as opposed to ifia , our scheme requires no csit .",
    "we evaluate the performance of our scheme and compare the results with the minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) and zero - forcing ( zf ) , as well as the iflr schemes .",
    "the results indicate that , in all signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) , our ifmr scheme outperforms the mmse and zf schemes , in terms of achievable rate , substantially .",
    "also , the ifmr scheme achieves slightly less rates in moderate snrs , compared to iflr , with significantly less implementation complexity .",
    "in addition , our proposed algorithm provides a tight lower bound for the results obtained via the np hard exhaustive search .",
    "for instance , consider a three - pair interference channel with single antenna at the transmitters / receivers .",
    "then , the achievable rate of the exhaustive search is only 1 db better than our proposed algorithm in 1 bit / channel use .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model and iflr are briefly described .",

    "this is an acceptable assumption in simple setups with no coordinations and central processing units in which channel state information ( csi ) feedback and beamforming is infeasible . incorporating partial csit",
    "is left for future work . in this system ,",

    "the elements of @xmath21 are assumed to be independent identically distributed ( iid ) gaussian variables with variance @xmath24 .",
    "we focus on real - valued channels",
    ". however , our scheme and results are directly applicable to complex - valued channels via a real - valued decomposition , as in [ 5]-[6 ] .",
    "transmitter @xmath18 exploits a lattice encoder with power constraint @xmath25 to map @xmath19 message streams @xmath26 to a real - valued codeword matrix @xmath27 with dimension @xmath28 , where @xmath8 is the codeword length .    according to fig .",
    "1 , the received signal at receiver @xmath18 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is iid additive white gaussian noise with the variance @xmath31 .",

    "note that the iflr scheme does the lattice equation quantization ( 3 ) @xmath37 times , which increases the implementation complexity with @xmath37 significantly .",
    "hence , the iflr scheme leads to significantly higher complexity compared to the mmse and zf schemes [ 1]-[2 ] , i.e. , @xmath50 more decoding for each receiver @xmath18 .    in section iii",
    ", we propose our ifmr scheme where , independently of @xmath17 and @xmath51 , each receiver @xmath18 only requires lattice equation decoding twice the number of the desirable messages , i.e. , @xmath52 , with a low complexity best equation selection process .",

    "@xmath53 in ( 1 ) , independent dcms are recovered . for each dcm ,",
    "the observed interfered signal is integer - forced to an ucm .",

    "the structure of an equation in ifmr is proposed , and accordingly its receiver model is presented .",

    "for instance , in the cases with @xmath165 and @xmath166 , the performance degradation , compared to the optimal exhaustive search - based approach , is less than 1 db in 1 bit / channel use and 1 db in 2 bit / channel use , respectively .",
    "it is also observed that the ifmr scheme outperforms the conventional mmse and zf receivers at all snrs , and the performance gap increases with snr which is because of the increase in interference .",
    "also , the ifmr scheme achieves slightly higher rates compared to the iflr scheme at low snrs .",
    "it is due to the fact that the optimal equations recovered from ( 6 ) may have zero elements with high probability at low snrs [ 18 ] , whereby a subset of the equations would be enough for recovering the desirable messages .",
    "note that the iflr scheme leads to better achievable rates compared to the ifmr scheme at high snrs , at the expense of much higher complexity .",
    "for example , the iflr scheme has 2 db improvement compared to the ifmr scheme at 1.15 bit / channel use in the one antenna case ( fig .",
    "3 ) and 2.5 db improvement at 2.5 bit / channel use in two antennas case ( fig .",

    "( 4 ) ] @xmath168 as observed , for small values of @xmath167 , the throughput increases with the rate almost linearly , because with high probability the data is correctly decoded . on the other hand , the outage probability increases and the throughput goes to zero for large values of @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , depending on the snr , there may be a finite optimum for the target rate in terms of throughput .    in figs .",
    "7 and 8 , the effect of the number of receiving antennas @xmath158 is assessed on the achievable rate and the outage probability of the proposed algorithm when each transmitter has one antenna .",
    "the outage probability is defined as @xmath169 . here , @xmath167 = 1 bit / channel use is considered . as can be observed from fig .",
    "7 , the achievable rate increases with the number of antennas @xmath158 .",
    "for example , in sum rate of 2 bit / channel use , the system with @xmath170 improves the power efficiency by 4 db and 10 db compared to the cases with @xmath171 and @xmath166 , respectively . also , from fig .",
    "8 , the ifmr scheme results in diversity , i.e. , the slope of the outage probability curves at high snrs , approximately equal to @xmath158 .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a low - complexity linear receiver scheme , referred to as ifmr , for interference channels . in ifmr , an integer combination of the desirable messages of each receiver can be recovered with the help of only two equations independently of the number of transmitters and data streams .",
    "we first proved that the sequential selection of the integer combinations can achieve the same rate as in the optimally joint selection .",
    "then , we proposed a suboptimal algorithm to optimize the required equations and integer combinations in polynomial time and proved its convergence . despite of its much less complexity for ifmr , our proposed algorithm can achieve almost the same performance as in the exhaustive search scheme .",
    "the ifmr scheme also shows a significantly better performance , in terms of the achievable rate , in comparison with the mmse and zf schemes .",
    "let the independent dcm coefficient vectors @xmath172 be selected by the sequential method in ( 10 ) . according to the constraint in ( 10 ) , we have @xmath173 .",
    "hence , the achievable rate of the sequential technique is @xmath174 .",
    "suppose also that the independent set @xmath175 , i.e. , @xmath176 , are the optimum solution of ( 9 ) . without loss of generality , assume that @xmath177 .",
    "thus , the achievable rate of the optimal technique is @xmath178 .    using contradiction , assume @xmath179 .",
