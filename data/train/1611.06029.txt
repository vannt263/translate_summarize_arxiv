    "tight - binding ( tb ) analysis on the two - dimensional lattices draws much attentions nowadays for their predictions of exotic electronic properties before the availability of results based on the experimental investigations .",
    "although the regular polygons like triangles , squares and hexagons fill up a plane surface without overlap and leaving any voids , it is impossible to do so by regular pentagons due to its five - fold symmetry . thus to fill up a plane surface one has to use irregular pentagons .",
    "those irregular pentagons can be derived from the regular one either by changing the angles between the arms keeping its length fixed or by changing both the length of the arms as well as the angles between them .",
    "the cairo pentagonal lattice is made of irregular pentagons with different angles between the arms by keeping their lengths fixed .",
    "the recent theoretical study on cairo pentagonal lattice indicates the presence of a large band - gap .",
    "the magnitude of this gap is 3.25 ev which is predicted by density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "this system is known as penta - graphene ( p - graphene ) which is essentially a cairo pentagonal monolayer of carbon atoms@xcite .",
    "dft analysis on other cairo pentagonal monolayers of boron nitride and silver azide similarly indicates the signature of a single band - gap@xcite .",
    "the tb analysis on p - graphene supports the existence of the same single band - gap whose estimated value is very close to the previous prediction@xcite .",
    "the nature of optical absorption around this band - gap is studied .",
    "the presence of band - gap is also important for the engineering of electronic devices . in this article",
    "we are going to introduce a tb model on another pentagonal lattice that is composed of different types of irregular pentagons ( fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ( a ) ) . for this",
    "model multiple band - gaps are observed in the tb analysis rather than a single one .",
    "the lattice can be derived from the honeycomb lattice in the following way .",
    "the parent ( honeycomb ) lattice is elongated vertically in such a manner that vertical bonds get doubled in its original length .",
    "additional lattice points are introduced in the middle of each vertical bonds . after joining these additional points this particular structure of pentagonal lattice",
    "is obtained . in the resulting lattice ,",
    "any horizontal layer is made of identical pentagons by placing them side by side without overlapping and leaving any voids .",
    "the adjacent layers those are just vertically above or down of this one are made of inverted pentagons .",
    "the lattice is non - bravais .",
    "one can visualize this lattice as composed of six interpenetrating rectangular bravais lattices , those are identical to each other . in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ( b ) , these sublattices are identified by b@xmath0 , b@xmath1 , b@xmath2 , c@xmath0 , c@xmath1 and c@xmath2 .",
    "those sublattices can be divided on the basis of their coordination numbers into two types .",
    "coordination number of both b@xmath0 and c@xmath0 is four while it is three for the others . the rectangular unit cell of this lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ( c ) .",
    "it contains six lattice points .",
    "this lattice has the translational invariance of length @xmath3 along the @xmath4-direction and that of length @xmath5 along the @xmath6-direction , where @xmath7 is the length of shorter arms of the pentagon .",
    "it also has rotational invariance of the angle 180@xmath8 . the first brillouin zone is shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ( d ) .",
    "very few theoretical results are available for this lattice .",
    "the bond - percolation threshold is determined and the stability of collinear nel - type classical ground state for antiferromagnetic ( afm ) heisenberg system on this lattice is studied .",
    "in addition , ground state entropy and energy are estimated for the ising and afm heisenberg models , respectively@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , based on the cairo pentagonal lattice structure , geometric frustration of afm compound , bi@xmath1fe@xmath9o@xmath10 has been investigated@xcite .",
    "another cairo pentagonal lattice structure that has been experimentally realized is the afm organic radical crystal , @xmath11 - 2,6-cl@xmath1-v [ = @xmath11 - 3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,5-diphenylverdazyl]@xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proposed that a stable carbon allotrope called p - graphene could be materialized very soon which is entirely composed of cairo - typed carbon pentagons@xcite . the same argument may hold true for another new carbon allotrope based on the pentagonal lattice addressed here .",
