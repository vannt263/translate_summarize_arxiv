    "the mid - b star hr 2949 was for many years considered to be non - variable , and indeed was listed in standard star catalogues .",
    "however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rivinius et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) noted that the star is actually variable both photometrically as well as spectroscopically .",
    "they classified it as a he - weak star .",
    "here we report the discovery of a magnetic field and describe the line profile variations ( _ lpv _ ) due to surface abundance inhomogeneities .",
    "the existence of these inhomogeneities was already proposed by rivinius et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , but could not be investigated further on the basis of solely four spectra .",
    "eight archival spectra have been obtained with the _ feros _ instrument at la silla , providing a resolving power of 48000 over a spectral range of 375 to 890 nm .",
    "spectropolarimetric ( stokes @xmath0 ) data were taken with espadons at the 3.6 m cfht in the 2009/2010 season , in total 16 measurements .",
    "the observations were obtained as part of the magnetism in massive stars ( mimes ) large program .",
    "* koen & eyer ( 2002 ) ) quote a period of @xmath1d from _ hipparcos _ photometric data .",
    "re - analysing these data using the lomb - scargle statistic , we obtain @xmath2d . in the spectra ,",
    "the helium lines show the strongest variability .",
    "the time base covered by the spectra is long , 1999 to 2009 , but there is severe aliasing .",
    "however , the aliases are narrow and there is only one peak in reasonable agreement with the hipparcos data , at @xmath3d . as the epoch we chose the date of the espadons measurement showing the most negative field , so that our adopted ephemeris is : +    @xmath4",
    "the magnetic field as measured by espadons ( using least - squares deconvolution applied to metallic lines ) confirms the photometric and spectroscopic periods .",
    "figure  1 shows the respective phased variations .",
    "the field varies between @xmath5 and @xmath6 g . there is clear rotational line profile variability ( _ lpv _ ) , with no line in the spectrum unaffected . taking the behavior of the hei lines as a starting point",
    ", the other lines can be sorted into three variability morphology groups : * lines similar to helium * are those of mg i8807 , mgii4481 , oi8446 .",
    "they show a clear modulation of ew .",
    "lines behaving * inversely to hei * , are siii4128 and siiii4553 , crii4588 , pii6043 , p iii4222 , and the balmer lines .",
    "also these vary in ew with rotation .",
    "the majority of lines show a third pattern , e.g.  sii5640 , fe ii4949 , cii4267 , caii8662 , srii4215 , tiii4564 and thus shall be called * metal group * behavior . while these lines show clear _ lpv _ , their ew is rather non - variable .",
    "finally , some lines show different types of * hybrid * variation patterns .",
    "it is noteworthy that the balmer lines show a clear pattern .",
    "the line core shows an abundance - like pattern well described as an `` anti - helium''-group behavior .",
    "we attribute the pattern to an actual variation of the h - abundance , rather than to a change in local surface parameters . however , there are also changes in the balmer line wings probably caused by local parameter variations .",
    "although the effect is subtle , less than 0.5% , and in spite of the notoriously difficult normalization of the balmer wings in echelle data the pattern is identical in all lines .",
    "hr2949 is a magnetic star of the he - weak / si - strong type .",
    "its surface shows the clear signature of the typically complex abundance patterns characteristic to such stars .",
    "in addition to the abundance variation , the variability of the balmer line wings indicates some other local parameter changes , such as pressure or temperature , linked to the magnetic field ."
