    "the stochastic singular control problem is one of the classical research topics in control theory that keeps receiving a lot of interest in years .",
    "a typical such problem has an objective function as a functional of an underlying stochastic process over a finite or infinite horizon that needs to be minimized or maximized .",
    "this objective function often involves a functional of the control actions , which gives its name singular control or impulsive control depending on the form of the objective function .",
    "its well known deterministic counterpart is the minimum fuel control problem .",
    "the application of the stochastic singular control is certainly broad , such as financial engineering , resource management , or mechanical system control , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the goal of the stochastic singular control is to characterize the optimal control policy , if exists , and find the optimal value of the objective function . in a typical",
    "setting , the value function is known to satisfy a partial differential equation , referred to as the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation .",
    "however , the existence and regularity of its solution always remain a big challenge . even in the time homogeneous one dimensional case ,",
    "efforts are needed and special forms are treated in order to characterize the regularity of the optimal value function , see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite",
    ". the form of optimal policies in multi - dimensional or time inhomogeneous singular control problems could be much more complicated .",
    "soner and shreve @xcite studied a two dimensional singular stochastic control problem and showed the existence of a smooth solution to the associated hjb equation , where the underlying process is a two dimensional brownian motion with no drift .",
    "how to extend this method to a general multi - dimensional diffusion is still not clear .",
    "besides the viscosity solution technique on the study of hjb equations and stochastic control problems , e.g.,@xcite@xcite , which often yields a less regular solution , a lot of literature tackle the singular stochastic control problem through the optimal stopping and game theory .",
    "the standard optimal stopping problem is often referred to as the one obstacle problem , and double obstacles problem is referred to as a game .",
    "the connection between singular control and optimal stopping is a well known fact . to name a few , karatzas and",
    "shreve @xcite studied the connection between optimal stopping and singular stochastic control of one dimensional brownian motion , and showed that the region of inaction in the control problem is the optimal continuation region for the stopping problem .",
    "baldursson and karatzas @xcite established and exploited the duality between the myopic investor s problem ( optimal stopping ) and the social planning problem ( stochastic singular control ) , where an integral form and change of variable formula were also presented on this connection .",
    "ma @xcite dealt with a one dimensional stochastic singular control problem where the drift term is assumed to be linear and the diffusion term is assumed to be smooth , and he showed that the value function is convex and @xmath0 and the controlled process is a reflected diffusion over an interval .",
    "guo and tomecek @xcite solved a one dimensional singular control problem via a switching problem , and showed , using the smooth fit property @xcite , that under some conditions the value function is continuously differentiable ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this connection in a finite horizon case can also be found in @xcite , where the regularity of the value function is not fully investigated .    to be brief",
    ", there exists a double obstacle problem ( game ) associated with a singular control problem , and the derivative ( with respect to state variable ) of the value function of the singular control problem is just the value of this game .",
    "the optimal continuation region of this game coincides with the continuation region of the singular control problem , and the boundary of the continuation region turns out to be the reflecting boundary in the optimal singular control so that the controlled process is a reflected diffusion within this boundary .",
    "therefore , it is possible to pass on the regularity of the value function of the game to the regularity of the value function of the singular control , with extra smoothness add - on .",
    "for example , fukushima and taksar @xcite used this idea to show the existence of a classical solution to the hjb equation associated with a general one dimensional singular control problem .",
    "see also @xcite for an extension and a correction .",
    "therefore , the regularity of the value function of optimal stopping and game becomes critical for the study of the singular stochastic control .",
    "there are several major approaches to the study of optimal stopping and game , see @xcite@xcite for a general mathematical framework , and @xcite for an early survey . on the study of regularity of the value function , method of convex analysis",
    "can be found in @xcite , time - discretization method can be found in @xcite , and the penalty method was introduced by stettner and zabczyk @xcite .",
    "another major approach is via the variational inequalities pioneered by bensoussan and lions @xcite .",
    "since the variational inequalities involve dirichlet form , it sparks the research interest in the study of dirichlet form and its connection to markov processes , see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite .",
    "the application of dirichlet form to optimal stopping was studied in @xcite .",
    "zabczyk @xcite extended this result to a zero - sum game .",
    "fukushima and menda @xcite later investigated the refined solutions under absolute continuity condition on the transition function of the underlying process .",
    "however , most of these work dealt with the time homogeneous case .",
    "in this case , the associated hjb equation is an elliptic pde , and theories guarantee the existence of a smooth solution under some conditions , see , e.g. , @xcite . for the time inhomogeneous optimal stopping and game , however , the associated hjb equations are parabolic pdes , and the existence and regularity of the solutions are harder to analyze .",
    "for example , oshima @xcite applied the time inhomogeneous dirichlet form to this problem , and showed the fine and cofine continuity of the value function , with possible existence of exceptional sets in the result .",
    "refined solutions to time inhomogeneous optimal stopping and game via dirichlet form was studied in @xcite .",
    "palczewski and stettner @xcite@xcite used the penalty method to characterize the continuity of the value functions of a time inhomogeneous optimal stopping problem under weak feller condition on the underlying process .",
    "stettner @xcite then extended this method to finite horizon double obstacle problem ( game ) .",
    "but only continuity of the value functions was able to prove .",
    "dai and yi @xcite studied a one dimensional finite horizon optimal investment problem with transaction costs , where the terminal crra utility function is maximized .",
    "this problem is indeed a singular stochastic control problem , and by constructing its connection with a parabolic two obstacle problem , the authors proved the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 in their paper due to different order of @xmath4 ) regularity of the value function .",
    "the risky asset in their model follows a standard geometric brownian motion , and the objective function only involves a function of the terminal wealth .",
    "furthermore , that work lacks the verification theorem to show optimality .    in this paper",
    "we consider a more general model which certainly includes the one in @xcite .",
    "we provide conditions under which a classical solution to the associated hjb equation exists , thus the usual viscosity solution approach is avoided .",
    "the organizations of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the time inhomogeneous singular stochastic control problem that we are concerned with .",
    "then its associated zero - sum game problem is investigated in section [ tidynkin ] , where conditions and regularity of the value function are proved .",
    "this result is passed on to the value function of the singular control in section [ tisingular ] where a verification theorem and the optimal control policy are shown . in section [ opt_jump ]",
    "we study the finite horizon singular control in the situation that the terminal payoff function is more general , and show that the optimal policy involves a possible jump at maturity .",
    "the discussion on the regularity of the free boundaries of the continuation region in the optimal control is provided in section [ reg_b ] , followed by concluding remarks .",
    "given a probability space @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a family of measures under which @xmath7 is a one dimensional ito diffusion @xmath8 in which @xmath9 is a standard brownian motion , we consider the model @xmath10 for some constants @xmath11 , and here @xmath12 is a differentiable bounded function such that @xmath13 , for some constant @xmath14 .",

    "one looks for a control policy @xmath30 that minimizes @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 this problem is called the time inhomogeneous singular control problem .",
    "we solve this problem through a related time inhomogeneous zero - sum game ( dynkin game ) .",
    "now consider the objective function of a time inhomogeneous zero - sum game @xmath33 where @xmath34 follows @xmath35 two players , @xmath36 , observe the process @xmath37 and each of them can stop the process at any time @xmath38 respectively before @xmath39 . if @xmath40 stops the process at @xmath41 , he pays @xmath42 the amount @xmath43for convenience , we call the part @xmath44 the dividend .",
