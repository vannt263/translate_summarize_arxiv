    "the search for topological superconductors in solid - state systems is motivated by the possibility of realizing majorana zero - energy modes at their surfaces , which are of both fundamental and technological importance  @xcite . in the absence of intrinsic topological superconductors ,",
    "much effort has been put into engineering such systems from conventional components  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the proposals involving semiconductor - superconductor hybrid structures  @xcite as hosts for majorana modes , which have attracted considerable experimental attention  @xcite , there have been many recent theoretical proposals for artificially engineering effectively spinless low - dimensional @xmath0-wave topological superconductors  @xcite , which could localize zero - energy majorana modes at suitable defects such as vortex cores or system boundaries .",
    "the subject has been extensively reviewed in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "it is particularly desirable to realize spinless @xmath0-wave superconductors , as they support a single majorana mode at their boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the most promising of these proposals involves proximity - inducing superconductivity in a spin - orbit - coupled semiconducting nanowire in the presence of a magnetic field  @xcite , which has subsequently been the subject of a number of experiments  @xcite . by varying the magnetic field ,",
    "the system is predicted to undergo a transition from a nontopological to a topological phase .",
    "such an external magnetic - field - induced topological quantum phase transition has the considerable advantage of tuning the existence ( or absence ) of the majorana mode in the experimental system simply by changing the zeeman field .",
    "a key signature of the topologically nontrivial state is the quantized value @xmath2 of the differential conductance for tunneling into the wire at zero - bias voltage .",
    "this quantized conductance , associated with perfect andreev reflection , indicates the presence of a single localized majorana zero - energy mode at the wire end  @xcite . for a sufficiently high tunnel barrier",
    ", the conductance spectra will be peaked with this value at zero bias .",
    "while experimental results clearly show the development of such a peak upon tuning the system , at a finite magnetic field , into the predicted topological regime , the value of the zero - bias conductance peak is much less than the expected quantized value .",
    "the reasons for this discrepancy are addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and alternative nontopological explanations have been advanced  @xcite .",
    "the lack of quantization of the experimental observations can be reconciled  @xcite with the majorana theory by including the finite temperature and the finite length of the nanowire ( thus allowing the majorana modes from the two ends to overlap ) , but this physics is beyond the scope of our work where we restrict to zero temperature and a single normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) junction ( assuming the other majorana mode to be far away from this junction ) .",
    "the difficulty in interpreting the tunneling experiments has prompted numerous theoretical studies on the conductance of the nanowire device , using both numerical  @xcite and analytical techniques  @xcite .",
    "although the latter works consider highly idealized models of the system , they are nevertheless valuable as they give clear insight into the parametric dependence of the transport physics as well as its dependence on various physical properties of the experimental setup , which can then be applied to understand the more complicated numerical studies . an important question concerns the change in the conductance as the system is tuned from the topologically trivial to the nontrivial regimes ( e.g. , by tuning the applied magnetic field in semiconductor - superconductor hybrid structures ) .",
    "remarkably , this aspect of the physics has attracted relatively little attention using these analytic methods  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analytically address this aspect of majorana physics in topological nanowire junctions .    in this paper",
    "we examine the conductance spectra of one - dimensional ns junctions involving topological superconductors across their topological transition .",
    "we utilize the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) formalism  @xcite , which is commonly employed to study junctions with unconventional superconductors  @xcite , to obtain analytic results for the tunneling conductance of two models of a topological superconductor junction : a junction between a spinless normal metal and a @xmath0-wave superconductor , and a junction between a spinful normal metal and a spin - orbit - coupled @xmath1-wave superconductor in a magnetic field .",
    "the former is the simplest model for tunneling into a topological superconductor  @xcite , while the latter is a minimum model  @xcite for the semiconductor nanowire device where experimental signatures for majorana zero modes have been reported through the observation of zero - bias tunneling conductance peaks at the ns junction .",
    "we note that the spinless @xmath0-wave superconductor can be regarded as an effective low - energy theory for the semiconductor nanowire , but this is inadequate for understanding the conductance spectroscopy of the device .",
    "our analysis is analytical , and in particular we give explicit expressions for the zero - bias tunneling conductance at zero temperature , which clearly shows an abrupt change at the topological transition .",
    "specifically , we find that in the topological regime , the zero - temperature zero - bias conductance is quantized at a value of @xmath2 independent of the barrier strength @xmath3 , but the detailed structure ( e.g. , the width and the shape ) of the quantized zero - bias conductance peak is controlled by the barrier transparency and the magnitude of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "our btk theory for the topological ns junction also shows that a finite barrier transparency could lead to the experimentally observed soft gap which is ubiquitous in semiconductor nanowire tunneling experiments  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : np ] , we warm up by studying the conductance of a junction between a spinless normal metal and a spinless @xmath0-wave superconductor across the topological transition .",

    "in particular , we obtain analytic results for the conductance spectra in the limits of a strong zeeman field and strong spin - orbit coupling .",

    "we start by considering a one - dimensional junction between a spinless normal metal ( nm ) and a @xmath0-wave superconductor ( @xmath0sc ) , which are located at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "their interface at @xmath6 is modeled by a @xmath7-function barrier of strength @xmath3 following the btk prescription .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 controls the barrier transparency at the ns interface , and is the key parameter in the theory quantifying the tunneling conductance properties at the junction : a low ( high ) value of @xmath3 corresponds to a barrier with high ( low ) transparency at the ns interface .",

    "we have perfect normal reflection . in the nontopological regime ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath83 takes on nonuniversal values and is dependent upon @xmath3 and @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , the zero - bias conductance in the nontopological phase can strongly exceed the quantized value in the topological state : for the gapped nontopological state ( @xmath71 ) and at the topological transition point ( @xmath86 ) , we find the maximum values @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , which are realized for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we plot the calculated conductance as a function of energy in figs .",
    "[ fig : gens ] and  [ fig : gensz ] . in the former",
    "we show examples of the conductance spectra in the nontopological , transition , and topological regimes , while the latter explores more fully the variation of the conductance spectra in the topological state away from zero bias .",
    "the conductance spectra show a much more complicated structure than those in the spinless nm-@xmath0sc junction , reflecting the presence of three distinct gaps ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath77 ) in the strong soc limit of the socsw . indeed , at the energy corresponding to each gap we observe a nonanalyticity in the conductance spectrum .",
    "although there is considerable variation in the conductance spectrum as a function of energy , a number of trends can be discerned : increasing @xmath3 tends to suppress the conductance , the energy variation of the conductance is nonmonotonic in general with cusplike structures at specific energies , and the energy variation of the conductance is stronger near zero energy for larger values of @xmath3 . while the conductance at first tends to be enhanced by increasing the soc , the conductance eventually goes through a maximum before monotonically decreasing .",
    "similarly , the soc increases the width of the zero - bias peak in the topological regime , but beyond a certain soc strength it decreases again .",
    "the basic finding is that , other than the universal quantized majorana peak at zero energy , the tunneling conductance shows interesting and nontrivial dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath34 in the topological phase . in particular , an interesting conclusion of our theory is that the zero - bias conductance could be quantized in the topological phase for small values of @xmath3 without developing a peak in the tunneling conductance at all .",
    "note that the above discussion holds true also for the case where the zeeman coupling in the lead or the chemical potential @xmath93 of the socsw are nonzero . for the case where @xmath94 , the zero - bias peak formed in the topological regime is within an energy range of @xmath92 . since the topological gap @xmath95 decreases with the absolute value of the chemical potential @xmath96 , the width of the zero - bias peak decreases with @xmath96 .",
    "using the btk formalism we have analytically studied the zero - temperature tunneling conductance spectra of ns junctions involving topological superconductors . finite temperature effects within this formalism",
    "simply lead to thermal broadening of the zero - temperature conductance and can be included in the theory numerically by introducing an integration over the fermi function  @xcite . as in the btk paper  @xcite , the finite - voltage conductances are found to depend on the strength of the barrier at the interface , which is parameterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , we have examined a spinless nm-@xmath0sc junction and a spinful nm - socsw junction , paying particular attention to the change in the zero - bias conductance across the topological phase transition .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that the zero - temperature zero - bias conductance is quantized at a value of @xmath2 in the topological regime , in agreement with effective models of these systems based on a single majorana mode coupled to a normal channel . despite this quantization at zero voltage ,",
    "the zero - bias conductance only develops a peak ( or a local maximum ) as a function of voltage for barriers with sufficiently large @xmath3 parameter , or for small and large soc strength .",
    "these parameters also control the width of this peak . in the nontopological regime",
    ", on the other hand , the conductance takes nonuniversal values depending upon the details of the system . in both cases",
    "the conductance spectrum away from zero bias shows considerable variation with the details of the junction .",
    "our calculated btk conductance also shows that the conductance is finite inside the superconducting gap region because of the finite barrier transparency , providing a possible mechanism for the observed  soft gap \" feature in the experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "this effect is qualitatively similar to the  inverse proximity effect \" at the ns interface arising from the finite barrier at the interface as discussed in the recent literature  @xcite , although other possible physical mechanisms for the soft gap behavior have also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "we mention finally that our theory is for a single ns junction which effectively assumes the existence of only a single majorana mode at the ns interface ( with the other majorana being located infinitely far away ) and thus majorana splitting  @xcite due to the wave function overlap between two majorana modes is not germane to our theory ( but can be included if necessary in a future generalization ) .",
    "finally , we emphasize that one of the most salient features of our theoretical work is that it is completely analytical within a continuum model in contrast to most theoretical works on majorana nanowires which focus on numerical simulations within a tight - binding lattice model .",
    "all the microscopic details of the complex normal - superconductor tunneling process are simply subsumed in a single phenomenological parameter @xmath3 (  the interface barrier strength \" of the btk formalism ) allowing our theory a great deal of flexibility for actual modeling of the majorana nanowire experimental results , since the realistic microscopic details of the ns interface are rarely known in the actual experimental nanowire setups .",
    "it is gratifying that our analytical model captures the essential features of the majorana nanowire experiments through our finding of the majorana zero - bias conductance quantization and soft gap feature , with the interesting prediction that for strong metallic junction ( i.e. , for very low interface barrier or a small value of @xmath3 ) the majorana zero - bias conductance may not necessarily be a peak in the tunneling conductance although it would still be quantized since the majorana zero mode necessarily implies perfect andreev reflection .",
