    "<S> integrated photonic devices are poised to play a key role in a wide variety of applications , ranging from optical interconnects @xcite and sensors @xcite to quantum computing @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , we demonstrate the use of an inverse design method that explores the full design space of fabricable devices and allows us to design devices with previously unattainable functionality , higher performance and robustness , and smaller footprints compared to conventional devices @xcite . we designed a silicon wavelength demultiplexer that splits @xmath0 and @xmath1 light from an input waveguide into two output waveguides , and fabricated and characterized several devices . the devices display low insertion loss @xmath2 , high contrast @xmath3 , and wide bandwidths @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the device footprint is @xmath5 , making this the smallest dielectric wavelength splitter to date .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 ginzton laboratory , stanford university , stanford , ca , 94305    @xmath7 _jela@stanford.edu_    electronic hardware description languages , such as verilog and vhdl , are widely used in industry to design digital and analog circuits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the automation of large scale circuit design has enabled the development of modern integrated circuits which can contain billions of transistors . </S>",
    "<S> photonic devices , however , are effectively designed by hand . </S>",
    "<S> the designer selects an overall structure based on analytic theory and intuition , and then fine tunes the structure using brute - force parameter sweep simulations . </S>",
    "<S> due to the undirected nature of this process , only a few degrees of freedom @xmath8 are available to the designer . the field of integrated photonics would be revolutionized if the design of optical devices could be automated to the same extent as circuit design .    </S>",
    "<S> we have previously developed an algorithm which can automatically design arbitrary linear optical devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our method allows the user to _ </S>",
    "<S> design by specification _ </S>",
    "<S> , whereby the user simply specifies the desired functionality of the device , and the algorithm finds a structure which meets these requirements </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , our algorithm searches the full design space of fabricable devices with arbitrary topologies . </S>",
    "<S> these complex , aperiodic structures can provide previously unattainable functionality , or higher performance and smaller footprints than traditional devices , due to the greatly expanded design space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm uses local - optimization techniques based on convex optimization @xcite to efficiently search this enormous parameter space .    here , we demonstrate the capabilities of our inverse design algorithm by designing and experimentally demonstrating a compact wavelength demultiplexer on a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) platform . one of the key functions of silicon photonics is wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) , which multiplies the data capacity of a single optical waveguide or fiber optic cable by the number of wavelength channels used @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . unfortunately , conventional wavelength demultiplexers such as arrayed waveguide gratings @xcite , echelle grating demultiplexers @xcite , and ring resonator arrays @xcite are fairly large , with dimensions ranging from tens to hundreds of microns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our device has a footprint of only @xmath5 , which is considerably smaller than any previously demonstrated dielectric wavelength splitter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the general formulation of the inverse design problem for optical devices . </S>",
    "<S> we choose to specify performance of our device by defining the mode conversion efficiency between sets of input modes and output modes at several discrete frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> these modes and frequencies are specified by the user , and kept fixed during the optimization process . in the limit of a continuous spectrum of frequencies , any linear optical device can be described by the coupling between sets of input and output modes , making this a remarkably general formulation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose the input modes @xmath9 are at frequencies @xmath10 , and can be represented by equivalent current density distributions @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> . then the electric fields @xmath12 generated by the input modes should satisfy maxwell s equations in the frequency domain , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electric permittivity , and @xmath15 is the magnetic permeability of free space .    </S>",
    "<S> we can then specify @xmath16 output modes of interest for each input mode @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the output mode electric fields @xmath18 over output surfaces @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the device performance is then specified by constraining the amplitude coupled into each output mode to be between @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the constraint , @xmath23 where we have used overlap integrals to compute the mode coupling efficiency into each output mode , and assumed that the input and output modes are appropriately normalized .    </S>",
    "<S> the inverse design problem thus reduces to finding the permittivity @xmath14 and electric fields @xmath12 which simultaneously satisfy physics , described by equation [ eqn : wgwdm_physics_spec_1 ] , and the device performance constraints , described by equation [ eqn : wgwdm_physics_spec_2 ] . in general </S>",
    "<S> , we also have additional constraints on the permittivity @xmath14 due to fabrication limitations .    </S>",
    "<S> we use two methods for solving this problem , the _ objective first _ method @xcite and a _ steepest descent _ method . in the _ objective </S>",
    "<S> first _ method , we constrain the electric fields @xmath12 to satisfy our performance constraints in equation [ eqn : wgwdm_physics_spec_2 ] , but allow maxwell s equations to be violated . </S>",
    "<S> we then minimize the violation of physics using the alternating directions method of multipliers ( admm ) optimization algorithm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we call this method `` objective first '' since we are forcing the fields to satisfy the performance objectives first , and then attempting to satisfy maxwell s equations .    in our _ </S>",
    "<S> steepest descent _ method , we constrain our electric fields @xmath12 to satisfy maxwell s equations , and define a performance metric function based on the violation of our device performance constraints in equation [ eqn : wgwdm_physics_spec_2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we then compute the local gradient of the performance metric by solving an adjoint electromagnetic problem , and perform steepest - gradient descent optimization @xcite .    to design the compact wavelength demultiplexer , we chose a simple planar 3-port structure with one input waveguide , two output waveguides , and a square design region , as illustrated in figure * [ fig:1_wgwdm_invdes]a*. for ease of fabrication , the structure was constrained to a single fully etched @xmath24 thick @xmath25 layer on a @xmath26 substrate with air cladding . </S>",
    "<S> refractive indices of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 were used . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental te mode of the input waveguide was used as the input mode for the inverse design procedure , and the fundamental te modes of the two output waveguides were used as the output modes . at @xmath0 , we specified that @xmath30 of the input power should be coupled out of port 2 and @xmath31 of the power should be coupled out of port 3 ; the converse was specified for @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the optimization processes proceeded in several stages , as outlined in figure * [ fig:1_wgwdm_invdes]b*. in the first stage , the permittivity @xmath14 in the design region was allowed to vary continuously between the permittivity of silicon and air ( linear parameterization ) . </S>",
    "<S> the objective first method was used to generate an initial guess for the structure , and then the steepest descent method was to fine tune the structure . in the second stage , </S>",
    "<S> the structure was converted to a binary level - set representation @xcite , and then optimized using steepest descent . up to this point , </S>",
    "<S> the device performance had only been specified at the two center wavelengths , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the final stage , </S>",
    "<S> the device was optimized for broadband performance by specifying the device performance at 10 different wavelengths , with 5 frequencies equally spaced about each center frequency . </S>",
    "<S> broadband performance was previously shown to be a heuristic for structures which are tolerant to fabrication imperfections , and it was hoped that this would result in a more robust design @xcite . the wdm device was designed in approximately 36 hours using a single server with three nvidia gtx titan graphics cards .    </S>",
    "<S> the final designed device is shown in * [ fig:2_wgwdm_struct]a*. the simulated electric fields at the central operating wavelengths of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are plotted in figure * [ fig:2_wgwdm_struct]b*. at both wavelengths , the light takes a relatively confined path through the structure , despite the convoluted geometry of the etched silicon layer .    the devices were fabricated by using electron beam lithography followed by plasma etching . </S>",
    "<S> scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) images of a final fabricated device is shown in figure * [ fig:3_wgwdm_sem]a*. the original design was accurately reproduced by the fabrication process , with the exception of two small @xmath32 holes next to the input waveguide which are missing .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured and simulated s - parameters for the compact wdm device are plotted in figure * [ fig:4_wgwdm_s - param]*. the plotted wavelength range was limited by the spectral bandwidth of the excitation source . </S>",
    "<S> measurements from three identically fabricated devices are plotted together in figure * [ fig:4_wgwdm_s - param]b * , showing that device performance is highly repeatable . </S>",
    "<S> although somewhat degraded in performance with respect to the simulated devices , the fabricated wdm devices exhibit relatively low insertion loss @xmath2 , high contrast @xmath3 , and very broadband @xmath4 pass and stop bands . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the discrepancy between simulation and measurement to fabrication imperfections .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have experimentally demonstrated a compact , practical wavelength demultiplexer designed using our inverse design algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this device provides functionality which never before been demonstrated in such a small structure . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the inverse design of optical devices will revolutionize integrated photonics , ushering in a new generation of highly compact optical devices with novel functionality and high efficiencies . </S>"
