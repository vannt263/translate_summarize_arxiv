    "<S> on the other hand , crystalline insulators are experimentally stable when the applied field is not too strong , and the field - dependent response of the systems ( such as dielectric and piezoelectric properties ) is well defined in the measurements . </S>",

    "<S> it can be demonstrated more clearly as follows : if the system transits from an initial wave - function @xmath21 to a final one @xmath22 , then for a second initial wave - function @xmath23 , the system will transit into the final one @xmath24 , i.e. , the initial phase keeps unchanged . such a process is invariant for time translation . </S>",

    "<S> so if the electric field satisfies the following relation : @xmath81 the dielectric susceptibility diverges and its sign changes when the electric field goes across such points , which results in the peaks of the polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> the revealed properties of polarization at finite fields here are helpful in understanding the convergency of the perturbation theories . </S>",
    "<S> the electric filed associated with the peaks of polarization is a kind of `` singular point '' . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 16 ) it is known that there are more and more such singular points when the electric filed is getting smaller . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the zero field @xmath82 is a non - isolated singular point of which there are always other singular points within any small neighborhoods . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if the properties of the system are expanded in the form of power series in the electric field , the series are not convergent within any finite neighborhood of radius centered about @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> that is the reason why the perturbation theories in continuum formulation are valid only for infinitesimal fields.@xcite    when the band energy @xmath77 has a minimal value , the solution of ground state can be obtained by minimizing the energy functional eq .  </S>",

    "<S> unfortunately , the minimal value of @xmath77 does not exist in continuum formulation due to the term @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> a technique to remove such difficulty is to perform a discretization on the @xmath5-space , i.e. , to restrict the maximal value of the number @xmath67 , which has been adopted in numerical schemes.@xcite however , when the electric field is large enough to shift the higher band to below the lower band , i.e. , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the discretization number in @xmath5-space , the minimizing procedure will fail in obtaining the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> that is the phenomena of collapse appeared in the numerical schemes.@xcite it is clear that such phenomena are associated with the breaking of the numerical schemes , but not with the breaking of the system such as zener tunneling@xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> although there are infinite peaks in the calculated curve of polarization around @xmath82 , the properties of the system is smooth enough in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> so it is necessary to have a short discussion on the width of the peaks . after a simple analysis of degenerate perturbation around the peak </S>",

    "<S> then we get @xmath92^{1/2}= 3.3\\times 10^{-11}$ ] ( in si unit ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that such narrow peaks at small electric fields are too difficult to be observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the properties obtained in experiments reflect an average effect where the peaks are smoothed out . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we depict the curves of the average polarization and dielectric susceptibility after the peaks are removed . </S>",

    "<S> the dielectric susceptibility is non - monotonic , which means some high - order susceptibility terms are negative .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that some issues discussed in this paper , such as the multivalued property of the polarization and the absence of ground state at finite electric fields , are caused by the periodic boundary conditions imposed on the insulators . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider a finite piece of a solid and surface effects , such problems will disappear . </S>",
