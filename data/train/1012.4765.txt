    "a self - map @xmath0 of a metric space @xmath1 is _ non - expansive _ if @xmath2 .",
    "a general problem consists in studying the asymptotic behaviour of the orbits of @xmath0 .",
    "this is motivated in particular by the celebrated theorem of denjoy and wolff  @xcite on the iteration of holomorphic self - maps of the unit disk ( these maps are non - expansive in poincare s metric ) .",
    "other motivations arise from the cases of non - expansive self - maps of banach spaces and of self - maps of cones that are non - expansive in hilbert s , thompson s or riemannian metric , which have received a considerable attention , due in particular to applications in game theory  @xcite , discrete event systems  @xcite , quadratic optimal control or filtering  @xcite , and non - linear perron - frobenius theory  @xcite .",
    "several denjoy - wolff type results , either in the setting of metric spaces , or concerning the special case of cones have appeared , see in particular  @xcite .",
    "the reader may consult the monograph  @xcite for an overview of the field .    in this paper , we consider the linear _ escape rate _",
    "@xmath3 the latter always exists , by a standard subadditive argument .",
    "our main result is the following maximin characterisation of the escape rate .",
    "[ th - minimax ] let @xmath0 be a non - expansive self - map of a complete metrically star shaped hemi - metric space @xmath1 .",
    "then , @xmath4 where the maximum , which is attained , is taken over the set of martin functions @xmath5 of @xmath1 .",
    "if in addition the hemi - metric @xmath6 is bounded from below ( in particular , if @xmath6 is a metric ) , and if @xmath7 , then any function attaining the maximum is a horofunction .",
    "let us explain the terminology .",
    "_ hemi - metrics _ are analogous to metrics , but @xmath8 and @xmath9 may differ .",
    "their definition is a variation of that of _ weak metrics _ in  @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ metrically star shaped _",
    "space is the object of definition  [ defistarshaped ] below .",
    "it requires a distinguished family of geodesics with a common origin to satisfy a convexity inequality .",
    "hence , it is a mild form of busemann s classical non - positive curvature condition  @xcite .",
    "_ martin functions _ and _ horofunctions _ are special lipschitz functions of constant @xmath10 which arise when compactifying the hemi - metric space @xmath1 .",
    "the set of horofunctions ( the _ horoboundary _ ) provides an abstract boundary of @xmath11 .",
    "see   [ subsec - horo ] for details .",
    "theorem  [ th - minimax ] is inspired by the classical collatz - wielandt characterisation of the perron root @xmath12 of a @xmath13 non - negative matrix @xmath14 .",
    "the latter shows that @xmath15 here , @xmath16 denotes the set of real non - negative numbers , and so @xmath17 is the standard positive cone .",
    "nussbaum showed in  @xcite that the latter formula holds more generally when the map @xmath18 is replaced by a non - linear continuous order - preserving @xmath0 of the standard positive cone .",
    "when @xmath0 preserves the interior of this cone , it is non - expansive in the ( reverse ) _ funk hemi - metric _",
    "@xcite defined on this interior by @xmath19 thus , @xmath20 the collatz - wielandt formula and its non - linear extension in  @xcite will be shown to be special instances of the maximin formula  .",
    "theorem  [ th - minimax ] is also motivated by the case of a banach space @xmath11 .",
    "then , one may consider the limit @xmath21 for instance , in the setting of zero - sum games , @xmath0 is the dynamic programming or _ shapley operator _  @xcite ( which acts on a banach space of continuous functions equipped with the sup - norm ) , and the latter expression represents the limit of the mean payoff per time unit as a function of the initial position , when the horizon of the game tends to infinity , see  [ appli - shapley ] for more background .",
    "a theorem of pazy  @xcite shows that the limit   does exist if @xmath11 is a hilbert space ; further improvements , under suitable strict convexity assumptions were done by reich@xcite and then by kohlberg and neyman  @xcite : the limit exists in the weak ( resp .",
    "strong ) topology if @xmath11 is reflexive and strictly convex ( resp .",
    "if the norm of the dual space @xmath22 is frchet differentiable ) . without strict convexity , the limit may not exist , even when @xmath11 is finite dimensional , however , a general result of kohlberg and neyman  @xcite ( corollary  [ linear ] below ) shows that there is always a linear form @xmath23 of norm @xmath10 such that @xmath24 holds for all @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is precisely the term at the left - hand side of  .",
    "the theorem of kohlberg and neyman may also be thought of as a special case of theorem  [ th - minimax ] .",
    "indeed , any horofunction @xmath5 attaining the maximum in   satisfies @xmath27 for all @xmath25 .",
    "we shall see that the kohlberg - neyman theorem follows readily from this result .",
    "we shall also recover as corollaries a generalisation of a result of gaubert and gunawardena  @xcite ( corollary  [ linearcompact ] ) concerning shapley operators , as well as a refinement of a result of gunawardena and walsh  @xcite valid in symmetric cones , corollary  [ cor - symm ] below .",
    "theorem  [ th - minimax ] turns out to be related to a denjoy - wolff type theorem of karlsson  @xcite , theorem  [ thmkarlsson ] below .",
    "karlsson showed that an inequality similar to   holds .",
    "he used a general subadditivity argument , which does not require any non - positive curvature condition .",
    "the statement of  @xcite assumes the metric space to be proper , i.e. , closed balls to be compact , but this assumption can be relaxed by defining horofunctions with respect to the topology of pointwise convergence as we do here .",
    "however , there are essential discrepancies between   and the result of  @xcite : the term @xmath28 is replaced there by the linear escape rate @xmath29 , and the horofunction @xmath5 _ depends _ on the choice of the point @xmath30 , whereas it does not in  .",
    "we shall see that without a non - positive curvature condition , the formula   may not hold ( we give an example in which @xmath31 and @xmath5 necessarily depends on @xmath30 ) .",
    "hence , the maximin theorem  [ th - minimax ] holds only under more restrictive circumstances than the denjoy - wolff type result of karlsson . by comparison ,",
    "the interest of the more special theorem  [ th - minimax ] lies in its strong duality nature : it allows one to certify that @xmath32 , or dually , that @xmath33 , by exhibiting an element @xmath34 such that @xmath35 , or dually a martin function @xmath5 such that @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted in this respect that when @xmath11 is a banach space with a polyhedral norm , the horoboundary admits a simple effective description , see  @xcite .",
    "we say that @xmath37 is a _ hemi - metric _ on a set @xmath11 if the two following conditions are satisfied for all @xmath38 :    1 .",
    "@xmath39 2 .",
    "@xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 .",
    "we then say that @xmath42 is a hemi - metric space .",
    "notice that a hemi - metric is generally not a metric , since it is neither symmetric nor non - negative .",
    "this definition is closely related to the one of a _ weak metric _ in  @xcite , in which @xmath43 is required to be non - negative .",
    "the last condition of the definition corresponds to the _ weak separation _ condition in the latter reference .",
    "we allow @xmath43 to take negative values in order to deal with order - preserving positively homogeneous self - maps of cones ( section  [ sec - cones ] ) .",
    "to any hemi - metric , one can canonically associate a metric by the following lemma .    for any hemi - metric @xmath43 ,",
    "the function @xmath44 is a metric on @xmath11 .    verifying that @xmath6 is symmetric and satisfies the triangular inequality is easy .",
    "the positivity of @xmath6 comes from the fact that for all @xmath30 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 . finally , if @xmath47 then both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are non - positive so by the same argument they are both null , thus @xmath41 .",
    "in the sequel , @xmath11 is equipped with the topology induced by the metric @xmath6 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath42 is _ complete _ when the associated metric space @xmath1 is complete .",
