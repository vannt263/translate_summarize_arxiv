    "a primary scientific motivation for developing the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ was to perform surveys of the extragalactic sky up to 10  kev . the combination of _ chandra s _ superb angular resolving power and high - energy response is enabling the detection and optical identification of hard x - ray source populations at much fainter fluxes than previously possible @xcite .",
    "exposure times of 1  ms in each of two deep fields , the _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and -south ( cdf - s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reach depths of @xmath2 ( ) , and have resolved most of the x - ray background up to 7  kev .",
    "optical spectroscopic followup of a sample of the deep - field sources has revealed a diverse counterpart population @xcite .",
    "attention is now concentrated on understanding the physical nature of the counterparts , as well as their evolution over cosmic time .",
    "wider field - of - view surveys provide an essential complement to the deep fields  which in total cover @xmath4  deg@xmath1  particularly for this latter objective .",
    "large - area coverage is essential for providing statistically significant source samples at intermediate to bright fluxes (  @xmath0 ) . at the bright end of this flux range",
    "there are only @xmath5 sources deg@xmath6 , so that several square degrees must be covered to obtain significant samples .",
    "spectroscopic identification of a large fraction of these is necessary to sample broad redshift and luminosity ranges , and to determine space densities of seemingly rare populations such as high - redshift qso ii s , which appear about once per 100  ksec _ chandra _ field @xcite .",
    "wide - field hard x - ray surveys undertaken with instruments prior to _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ made preliminary investigations of the bright end of the hard source populations , although the positional accuracy achievable with these experiments was insufficient to securely identify a large number of counterparts .",
    "the _ bepposax _",
    "hellas survey @xcite identified 61 sources either spectroscopically or from existing catalogs in 62 deg@xmath1 to a flux limit of  @xmath7 .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "large sky survey identified 31 extragalactic sources in 20 deg@xmath1 @xcite , with the recent addition of 85 more spectroscopically identified sources from the _ asca _ medium sensitivity survey @xcite to a flux threshold of  @xmath8 .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm _ offer the potential to expand significantly this initial work to hundreds of sources detected over many square degrees .",
    "a number of programs are now underway to identify serendipitous sources in extragalactic pointings .",
    "besides the _ chandra _ deep fields , several other individual fields have been studied , and optical spectroscopic followup completed and reported .",
    "these include the lynx cluster field @xcite , the field surrounding abell 370 @xcite , and the hawaii survey field @xcite , each of which covers @xmath9  deg@xmath1 .",
    "ambitious efforts to extend coverage to several deg@xmath1 include the hellas2xmm survey @xcite , and champ @xcite , although followup results from these surveys have not yet been published .",
    "we present here the serendipitous extragalactic x - ray source identification ( sexsi ) program , a new hard x - ray survey designed to fill the gap between wide - area , shallow surveys and the _ chandra _ deep fields .",
    "the survey has accumulated data from twenty - seven _ chandra _ fields selected from gto and go observations , covering more than 2  deg@xmath1 .",
    "we have cataloged more than 1000 sources in the  band , have completed deep optical imaging over most of the survey area , and have obtained spectroscopic data on @xmath10  350 objects .",
    "table  [ tbl : surveycomp ] summarizes the published  x - ray surveys and demonstrates the contribution of the sexsi program .",
    "tabulated flux values have been corrected to the energy band  and to the spectral assumptions adopted here ( see  [ sec : reduction ] ) , as detailed in the footnotes to the table . in the flux range @xmath11 to @xmath12 , the seven existing surveys have discovered a total of 789 sources , several hundred fewer than the total presented here . in the flux range @xmath13",
    "to @xmath14 which lies between the _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ sensitivity limits and the _ chandra _ deep survey capability  where the  relation changes slope and from which the bulk of the  x - ray background arises @xcite  we more than triple the number of known sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : areadepth ] illustrates our areal coverage in comparison with that of previous work , emphasizing how sexsi complements previous surveys .    in this paper , we present the survey methodology and x - ray data analysis techniques adopted , the x - ray source catalog , and the general characteristics of the x - ray source sample . in a companion paper ( @xcite ; paper ii )",
    ", we provide a summary of our optical followup work , including a catalog of @xmath15 magnitudes ( and upper limits thereto ) for over 1000 serendipitous x - rays sources as well as redshifts and spectral classifications for @xmath16 of these objects , and discuss the luminosity distribution , redshift distribution , and composition of the sample .",
    "future papers will address detailed analyses of the different source populations as well as field - to - field variations .",
    "we selected fields with high galactic latitude ( @xmath17 ) and with declinations accessible to the optical facilities available to us ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we use observations taken with the advanced camera for imaging spectroscopy ( acis i- and s - modes ; @xcite ) only ( for sensitivity in the hard band ) .",
    "all the fields presented in this paper have data which are currently in the _ chandra _ public archive , although in many cases we made arrangements with the target pi for advanced access in order to begin spectroscopic observations prior to public release of the data .",
    "table  [ tbl : fields ] lists the 27 survey fields by target , and includes the target type and redshift if known , the coordinates of the field center , the galactic neutral hydrogen column density in this direction @xcite , the x - ray exposure time , and the acis chips reduced and included in this work .",
    "the observations included in our survey represent a total of 1.65 msec of on - source integration time and include data from 134 @xmath19 acis chips .",
    "net exposure times range from 18 ks to 186 ks ; a histogram of exposure times is given in figure  [ fig : exptimes ] .",
    "targets include a galactic planetary nebula , various types of agn , transient afterglow followup observations , ngc galaxies , and clusters of galaxies , particularly those at relatively high redshifts .",
    "for the cases in which the target is an extended x - ray source , we have taken care to exclude those sources potentially associated with the target from our  analysis ( see  [ sec : srcdeletions ] ) .",
    "the x - ray data reduction includes filtering raw event data to reject contaminating particle events , binning the event data into images with specific energy ranges , searching the images for sources , and extracting source fluxes .    for the initial processing steps ,",
    "through source identification , we use standard tools supplied by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ science center ( cxc ) .",
    "we employ _ asca _ event grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , and we eliminate flickering pixels and events at the chip node boundaries . for each chip",
    "we bin events into soft ( 0.3  2.1 kev ) and hard ( 2.1  7 kev ) band images .",
    "the 2.1  kev energy boundary is chosen to coincide with the abrupt mirror reflectance change caused by the ir m - shell edge , and the upper and lower limits optimize signal - to - noise in the images .",
    "we use wavdetect for initial source identification . in a subsequent step",
    "we test the significance of each source individually and eliminate sources with a nominal chance occurrence probability greater than @xmath20 .    for the remainder of the processing , we use primarily our own routines to filter the wavdetect source list to reject spurious detections , to extract source fluxes , and to correct wavdetect positions when required .",
    "in some cases , particularly at large off - axis angles where the point spread function ( psf ) is relatively broad , the wavdetect positions become unreliable , with some positions differing significantly from the centroid of the photon distribution .",
    "the differences are not uniformly distributed , and most are within the expected statistical tolerance . however , in typically one or two cases per field the wavdetect position will differ unacceptably , a discrepancy that has also been noted by others @xcite .",
    "we use the wavdetect positions , the standard used by most other authors , unless the psf - normalized radial shift @xmath21 arcsec , in which case we use the centroid position .    after correcting source positions",
    ", we extract photons from the image to determine source fluxes .",
    "the psf width is a strong function of off - axis angle . to determine extraction radii , we use the encircled energy fractions tabulated by the cxc at eight off - axis angles and at five different energies .",
    "we use the 1.5 kev and 4.5 kev values for the soft and hard bands , respectively , and interpolate linearly between tabulated values in off - axis angle . for the extraction radius we use an encircled energy fraction ranging from 80",
    " 90% , depending on the band and off - axis angle ( see table  [ tbl : psfoaa ] ) .",
    "this optimizes the signal - to - noise ratio , since the optimal fraction depends on signal - to - background ratio . to determine the background level for subtraction",
    ", we identify a number of circular , source - free regions on each chip , and for each source , use the closest region to determine the background .",
    "we define a sufficient number of regions distributed over the chip to ensure that systematic background variations are small compared to statistical uncertainties .    for each wavdetect source , we use the background level in the extraction aperture to calculate a lower limit to the number of total counts for which the probability ) sources and the gaussian limit for high - count ( @xmath22 ) sources . ] that the detection is a random fluctuation is less than @xmath20 .",
    "if the total extracted counts fall below this limit , we deem the candidate wavdetect source to have failed our significance criterion , and remove the source from the catalog . in on - axis chips , there are about @xmath23 detection cells , so we expect @xmath24 false detections per chip .",
    "off - axis chips have 4  8 times fewer detection cells , as we bin them before searching .",
    "thus , on average we expect @xmath25 false detection per field , depending on the number and configuration of chips read out .",
    "to convert extracted source counts to flux , we use standard _ cxo _ software to compute energy - weighted exposure maps using a power - law spectral model with photon spectral index @xmath26 . using these",
    ", we convert soft band counts to a 0.5  2 kev flux , and hard band counts to a 2  10 kev flux again adopting @xmath26 , and apply an aperture correction to account for the varying encircled energy fraction used in source extraction ( see table  [ tbl : psfoaa ] ) .",
    "we use the galactic column density for each field listed in table  [ tbl : fields ] to calculate source fluxes arriving at the galaxy in the hard and soft bands . for an on - axis source ,",
    "the conversion factor in the hard band is  @xmath27 ct@xmath28 , although this value varies by 5 - 10% from field to field owing to the differences in location of the aim point relative to node and chip boundaries .",
    "we note that @xmath29 represents a softer spectrum than the @xmath30 typically used for counts to flux conversion for the deep fields ; our choice was motivated by the brighter average flux of our sample .      in order to calculate the  relation and to characterize the serendipitous source populations in an unbiased manner",
    ", we remove sources associated with the observation targets . in the case of point source targets such as agn , transient afterglows , and the planetary nebula ,",
    "this excision is trivial : the target object is simply excluded from the catalog .",
    "for the nearby galaxies in which the target covers a significant area of the field , we have excised all sources within an elliptical region defined where , in our optical image of the galaxy , the galactic light is @xmath31 11@xmath32 above the average background level .",
    "this led to the removal of 68 sources from the catalog .",
    "finally , in the case of galaxy clusters , chandra s high angular resolution allows one to easily ` see through ' the diffuse emission from the hot intracluster gas to the universe beyond , and it is not necessary to exclude all discrete sources for optical followup studies .",
    "some such sources are , however , associated with the target cluster , and should not be included in our  analysis .",
    "thus , apart from a few sources detected in the hard band which represent the diffuse cluster emission ( and have thus been removed from the catalog ) , we have included all discrete sources detected in the cluster fields , but have flagged all those within @xmath33 mpc of the cluster centroid as potentially associated with the target .",
    "we exclude these flagged sources ( and the associated effective area ) from the  analysis ( a total of 190 sources ) .",
    "only a small fraction of these are actually optical spectroscopically - identified cluster members .",
    "we define the hardness ratios as @xmath34 , where h and s are the corrected counts in the  and  bands respectively .",
    "we extract the counts from our hard- ( 2.17 kev ) and soft- ( 0.32.1 kev ) band images using the centroids obtained by running wavdetect on the images separately ( and subsequently correct the rates to the standard bands ) .",
    "we do this , rather than extracting counts from the soft - band image using the hard - band positions in order to minimize bias , as described below .    in a small number of cases , wavdetect failed to find a soft source both clearly present in the image and with a hard source counterpart ( typically as a result of a second source very nearby ) . in order to correct these discrepancies , and to test for any systematic differences in soft and hard source positions",
    ", we also derived a soft flux for each source using the hard source centroid .",
    "we calculated hardness ratios using both sets of soft counts ( those derived by wavdetect and those extracted using hard - source positions ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : hrcomp.n0 ] and  [ fig : hrcomp.eq0 ] show a comparison of the two techniques .    using the optimal centroid position for a fixed aperture to extract source counts",
    "systematically overestimates source fluxes since the centroid selected will be influenced by positive background fluctuations to maximize the number of counts included  a form of eddington bias ; see @xcite .",
    "thus , calculating hardness ratios by using soft counts extracted from a region with the hard source centroid will produce a systematic bias toward greater hardness ratios .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : hrcomp.n0 ] , where we show the difference in the two methods for calculating the hardness ratio as a function of soft source flux ; while only 9 sources have a difference of @xmath35 , 48 sources have a difference of @xmath36 .",
    "the mean bias is @xmath37 . to avoid this",
    ", we use the hardness ratios derived from the independent soft and hard source catalogs .      in order to construct the hard x - ray source  curve",
    ", we must determine the effective area of our survey as a function of source flux ( shown in figure  [ fig : areadepth ] ) .",
    "we do this by using the same algorithms we employ for the actual source extraction and flux conversion , calculated on a fine grid which samples the entire field of view .",
    "our detailed calculation assures that , independent of the methodology used for background subtraction and source significance testing , our calculation of the effective area will be accurate .",
    "also , since we employ significant off - axis area in the survey , calculating the response with fine sampling across the field of view is required , given the rapid psf changes with off - axis angle and telescope vignetting .",
    "we divide the images from each chip , with the detected sources ` blanked out ' , into a fine grid sampled at a pitch of 8 pixels . at each location , we repeat the steps associated with source detection : we determine the aperture from the off - axis angle , background from the closest circular background region , and effective area from the spectrally - weighted exposure map at that location . using these , we determine the minimum detectable flux at that location corresponding to a spurious detection probability of @xmath20 .",
    "we step across the grid in this manner , so that we determine accurately the sky area as a function of minimum detectable flux even for chips where the response changes significantly over the image .",
    "this procedure results in an effective area function which optimally matches the source detection procedure and supports the construction of a  curve free of any biases which might be introduced by the approximate techniques adopted by some other surveys .",
    "in table  [ tbl : catalog ] we present the sexsi source catalog of 1034 hard - band discrete serendipitous x - ray sources detected as described above .",
    "sources are designated cxosexsi ( our iau - registered name ) followed by standard truncated source coordinates .",
    "the source positions ( equinox j2000.0 ) are those derived from the hard - band x - ray images ; in paper ii we use optical astrometry to derive mean offsets for each x - ray image and provide improved positions ( although offsets are typically less than @xmath38 ) .",
    "we include only sources detected with a chance coincidence probability of @xmath39 in the hard band .",
    "the angular distance of the source position from the telescope axis is given in column 4 .",
    "columns 5 and 6 list the background - subtracted counts for each source within the specified aperture derived from the 2.1  7 kev image , followed by the estimated background counts in that same aperture .",
    "column 7 gives an estimate of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the detection .",
    "the snr is calculated using the approximate formula for the poisson distribution with small numbers of counts given in @xcite :    @xmath40    for high - count sources equation  [ eqn : snr ] converges to the gaussian limit . owing to the relatively large background regions we have employed ,",
    "the background error is negligible in the snr calculation .",
    "it should be emphasized that these values are _ not _ a measure of source significance ( which is @xmath41 in all cases ) but is a measure of the uncertainty in the source flux estimates .",
    "column 8 shows the unabsorbed hard band flux ( in units of @xmath12 ) , corrected for source counts falling outside the aperture and translated to the standard  band assuming a power law photon spectral index of @xmath42 and a galactic absorbing column density appropriate to the field ( see table  [ tbl : fields ] ) .",
    "columns 9  12 provide the analogous values for the soft band .",
    "we derived soft - band fluxes by employing the same procedures on the wavdetect output from the 0.3  2.1 kev images , and then matching sources in the two bands .",
    "the soft fluxes are presented in the .",
    "there are a large number of soft sources which lack a statistically significant hard counterpart ; however , as we are interested in the  source populations , these sources are not included in the table or considered further here .",
    "we do include a catalog of the soft band only sources in the appendix .      as @xcite have recently discussed , the details of source detection and flux extraction can have non - trivial effects on the final source catalog derived from an x - ray image , as well as on conclusions drawn from the  relation . as a test of our methodology ,",
    "we have compared our results on one of the deeper fields in our sample , cl0848 + 4454 , with the analysis published by @xcite ( 2002b ; the spices survey ) which uses the same technique as @xcite apply to the cdf - s .",
    "the source detection algorithm , the flux estimation method , and the effective area calculations all differ from ours , so a comparison is instructive .    @xcite use the sextractor source detection algorithm @xcite applied to a version of the 0.5  7 kev image with a smoothed background and a signal - to - noise cut of 2.1 .",
    "they measure source fluxes using a source aperture of @xmath43 the psf full - width at half - maximum , with the background derived from an annulus @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "their simulations predict five false sources using this procedure .",
    "in contrast , we employ the wavdetect algorithm to generate a list of source candidates from the 2.1  7 kev image , use hand - selected , source - free background regions with larger average areas to minimize statistical uncertainties , and require each source to have a probability of chance occurrence @xmath39 , yielding @xmath46 false source in this field .",
    "as noted above , we also calculate a fine - scale effective area function using exactly the same significance criterion for each psf area on the image .",
    "figure  [ fig : lynx ] summarizes the result of comparing the two source catalogs .",
    "apart from three bright sources in the off - axis s-6 chip which was not analyzed by stern et al . , our catalogs are identical down to a flux threshold of @xmath47 . at fainter fluxes",
    ", there is a large number of spices sources  33 hard band detections  which fail to appear in our catalog ( see figure  [ fig : lynx ]  upper panel ) .",
    "we examined the hard - band images at each of these locations . in seven cases ,",
    "our wavdetect algorithm indicated source candidates were present , but each failed the @xmath41 significance test in the hard band .",
    "in most of the other cases , no source was apparent in the hard band , although quite a number had soft - band counterparts . in some cases",
    ", fortuitous background fluctuations in the annulus surrounding the source may have accounted for the reported spices hard - band detection . in nearly a third of the cases ,",
    "a plausible optical identification has been found , so it is clear that some of these sources are real x - ray emitters .",
    "however , in no case did our algorithm suite miss a source which would pass our specified threshold .",
    "since our effective area function is calculated in a manner fully consistent with our threshold calculation , our  will be unaffected by the absence of these faint , low - significance sources from our catalog .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : lynx ] indicates a systematic offset between the flux scale of the two catalogs of 15  20% , with our sexsi fluxes being systematically higher .",
    "most of this effect is explained by the count - to - flux conversion factors adopted in the two studies ( 3.24 and @xmath48 ct@xmath28 respectively for sexsi and spices ) , which in turn derives from the use of slightly different spectral index assumptions and a different generation of response function for the instrument .",
    "individual fluxes for weaker sources have discrepancies of up to 40% , which can be accounted for by different flux extraction and background subtraction algorithms applied to low - count - rate sources .    in summary , the differences between the two analyses of this field , while producing catalogs differing at the @xmath49 level in both source existence and source flux , are well understood .",
    "in particular we are confident that the self - consistent method we have adopted for calculating the source detection threshold and the effective area function will yield an unbiased estimate of the true   relation for hard - band x - ray sources .",
    "the cdf - n and -s have provided good measurements of the   relationship at fluxes below @xmath51 . in comparison ,",
    "the sexsi sample includes 478 sources with fluxes between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . by combining our measurements with the deep field results",
    ", we can constrain the  over a broad range , which includes the break from euclidean behavior .",
    "we use the cdf - s fluxes from @xcite along with the sexsi sample to construct the  between @xmath52 and @xmath54 . for the same reasons given by @xcite",
    ", we choose to work with the differential curve : the differential measurement provides statistically - independent bins , and comparison does not rely on the bright - end normalization , which must be taken from other instruments . to calculate the sexsi , we use the effective area curve ( figure  [ fig : areadepth ] ) to correct for incompleteness at the faint end of the sample .",
    "we have not corrected for eddington bias which is , by comparison , a small effect .",
    "we employ the cdf - s fluxes with a correction ( of about 5% ) to account for the different spectral index assumption ( @xmath55 for cdf - s compared to @xmath26 for sexsi ) .",
    "to correct for incompleteness in the cdf - s sample , we use the effective area curve provided to us by p. tozzi .",
    "we calculate the differential counts by binning @xmath56 , the number of sources with flux @xmath57 , into flux ranges , @xmath58 , then computing the average effective area , @xmath59 for that range , and forming the differential curve by @xmath60 we normalize to a unit flux of @xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ fig : difflnnlns ] shows the differential  curve from the combined sexsi and cdf - s catalogs , where the indicated errors are 1@xmath32 .",
    "the normalizations between the two agree well in the region of overlap , especially considering the different source extraction techniques and methodologies for calculating the effective area function .",
    "the combined data can not be fit with a single power law , but require a break in slope between @xmath61 .",
    "we fit the sexsi data with a single power law at fluxes above @xmath62 , and the cdf - s data to a separate power law below this .",
    "the fits are shown as solid and dashed lines in figure  [ fig : difflnnlns ] . the two intersect at a flux of @xmath63 .",
    "we note that the exact position of the intersection depends on where we divide the data , but for reasonable choices yielding good fits , the break always lies in the range @xmath64 which contains the break point first predicted on the basis of a fluctuation analysis of the _ einstein _ deep survey fields nearly two decades ago @xcite .",
    "the best - fit curves are parameterized by @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and @xmath67 below @xmath68 .",
    "the quoted errors are @xmath69 formal errors on the fits .",
    "the errors on the data points are statistical errors only , and do not include an estimate of the systematic uncertainties , such as biases on approximations in correcting for incompleteness . based on the good agreement of the overall normalization with other surveys ( see below )",
    ", the systematic errors do not exceed the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the faint - end slope is dependent on where we divide the fit ranges ; cutting the data at @xmath70 yields an acceptable faint - end fit , but with a steeper slope of @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lnncomp ] shows the fractional residuals from the best - fit curves for the sexsi survey ( top panel ) , the cdf - s ( middle ) , and combined hawaii ssa22 and cdf - n sample @xcite . for the hawaii / cdf - n data , we use the binned points ( provided in digital form by l. cowie ) , corrected for the different spectral slope assumed for counts to flux conversion . at the faint end ,",
    "the overall normalizations agree reasonably well , with the cdf - n data systematically slightly ( 1@xmath32 ) above the mean fit to the sexsi and cdf - s data .",
    "the faint - end slope of @xmath72 found here is marginally steeper than the best - fit values of @xmath73 found by @xcite and @xmath74 found by @xcite .",
    "this difference is largely due to the somewhat different normalization ; in addition , as noted above , the placement of the power - law break and the binning affects the best - fit slope , so this discrepancy is not significant . above @xmath75 ,",
    "the deep fields contain only 2  3 bins , and so the shape is much better constrained by the sexsi data .",
    "our best - fit slope at the bright end is @xmath76 , consistent both with a euclidean source distribution , and with the value of @xmath77 found for the hawaii+cdf - n data .",
    "most sexsi sources have too few x - ray counts to warrant spectral fitting , so we rely upon hardness ratios ( @xmath78 ) to characterize the spectral slope . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : hrcalc ] , we calculate the hardness ratio for each source , listed in column 13 of table  [ tbl : catalog ] , using positions determined by independently searching the hard and soft images . we assign hard - band sources that have no soft - band wavdetect counterpart at our significance level a @xmath78 of 1.0 .",
    "we have also determined a hardness ratio derived by extracting flux from the soft - band images at the position determined by searching the hard - band images , which we designate by @xmath79 .",
    "note this does not require a significant independent detection in the soft band , so that for many sources with @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( see figure  [ fig : hrcomp.eq0 ] ) . for reference , the slope of the x - ray background in this energy range , @xmath82 , corresponds to a @xmath78 of @xmath83 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hardness ] presents the @xmath78 for sexsi s 1034 sources as a function of hard - band flux .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : hardhist ] shows these same sources in an @xmath78 histogram .",
    "the lower three panels of figure  [ fig : hardhist ] show the hardness ratio histogram broken into three flux ranges .",
    "the upper right corner of each panel indicates the number of sources and average @xmath78 for each subsample .",
    "the entire sample has an average @xmath78 of @xmath84 , corresponding to @xmath85 .",
    "the histograms clearly illustrate the trend , previously noted by the ms surveys , for higher hardness ratios at lower fluxes .",
    "the highest flux ( second from the top ) panel in figure  [ fig : hardhist ] appears to show a bimodal distribution in hardness ratio , with a peak centered around @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , and a harder , smaller peak centered around @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "as the flux decreases , many of the harder sources move into the @xmath80 bin , while the center of the softer distribution shifts only slightly to the right .",
    "this motivates us to split the hardness distribution at @xmath90 , and investigate the distribution of the two sub - populations separately .",
    "table  [ tbl : hrtest ] shows the result of splitting the three flux - selected histograms at @xmath90 , where we present the average value of @xmath91 for the six populations .",
    "note we use @xmath79 to minimize the skew imposed by the sudden shift of sources to @xmath80 imposed by the requirement of separate detection in the soft image .",

    "presumably the hard sources are on average at lower redshift and thus do not exhibit the evolutionary effects likely to be responsible for the slope break until even fainter flux levels are reached .",
    "the sexsi catalog includes only sources independently identified in the hard band images , and so excludes those sources detected only in the soft band .",
    "thus , we expect our average hardness ratio to be significantly larger than that reported for the deep fields , which include a large fraction of soft - only sources . indeed ,",
    "@xcite analyze a stacked spectrum of the cdf - s total sample and report an average power law index of @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , much softer than our average @xmath102 .",
    "even the faintest subsample ,  @xmath103 , with an average @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , appears softer than our entire sample .    to make a better comparison to the cdf - s",
    ", we eliminated the soft - band only sources from their source catalog  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we translated their fluxes , which had been converted from counts using @xmath106 , to match ours , which assumed @xmath107 ( a correction of about 5% for the hard band ) .",
    "we also correct for the different spectral ranges assumed for their hard count rate measurement ( 2  7 kev for cdf - s compared to 2  10 kev for sexsi ) . using these converted @xmath78 s",
    "with the soft - band only sources ignored , we find that the average @xmath78 for the cdf - s sample is @xmath108 , comparable to the sexsi @xmath78 of @xmath84 . since cdf - s samples the fainter section of the , their slightly higher average @xmath78 is not surprising .    to further compare the surveys",
    ", we break the cdf - s sample into three flux ranges , as we did for our sample in figure  [ fig : hardhist ] .",
    "the cdf - s has no sources in the bright range (  @xmath109 ) . in the medium flux range ( @xmath110  @xmath111 )",
    ", we calculate the cdf - s average @xmath78 to be @xmath112 , as compared to sexsi s average @xmath78 of @xmath113 . for the low flux range ( @xmath114   @xmath115 ) ,",
    "the sexsi s average @xmath78 is @xmath116 as compared to @xmath117 for cdf - s .",
    "for each of these flux ranges we find the average @xmath78 s of sexsi and cdf - s to be comparable , but slightly higher for sexsi .",
    "this is likely explained by the different survey depths and source detection processes .",
    "as with the spices reduction of the cl0848 + 0454 field , cdf - s detects sources in full band ( 0.5  7 kev ) images and then extracts fluxes from the soft and hard band images regardless of detection significance in the individual bands . for a source that is below our threshold in the soft band we will report a flux of zero , while cdf - s may detect positive flux .",
    "if we compare the cdf - s @xmath78 s to our @xmath79 values of @xmath118 and @xmath119 for the mid- and low- flux ranges , we are consistent with the cdf - s values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we have completed the first `` large''-area ( @xmath122 deg@xmath1 ) hard x - ray source survey with the _ chandra _ observatory , and report here the x - ray characteristics of 1034 serendipitous sources from 27 fields detected in the  band .",
    "this work represents a sample size in the critical flux interval @xmath123 to @xmath14 that exceeds the sum of all previous surveys by a factor of three .",
    "we present a technique for calculating the effective area of our survey which is fully consistent with our source detection algorithm ; combined with the large source sample , this allows us to derive the most accurate  relation yet produced for hard x - ray sources at fluxes fainter than @xmath124 .",
    "we find that the slope of the relation is euclidean at fluxes above @xmath47 .",
    "combining the complete source sample with the cdf - s deep survey data indicates a break in the  slope at @xmath63 .",
    "calculation of separate   relations for the hard and soft portions of our sample shows that it is the softer hard - band sources which are responsible for this break ; sources with @xmath97 show no slope change down to a flux an order of magnitude fainter , suggesting ( as our spectroscopic followup and that of the deep surveys of @xcite and @xcite have confirmed ) that the hardest sources are predominantly a lower redshift sample .",
    "future papers in this series will describe our optical observations of this sample , providing further insight into the populations of x - ray luminous objects that comprise the x - ray background .",
    "we are deeply indebted to the following _ chandra _ guest investigators for their willingness to allow us immediate access to their data for the purposes of this statistical investigation of serendipitous sources : dr .",
    "jan vrtilek , dr .",
    "crystal martin , and prof .",
    "q. daniel wang .",
    "we also thank dr .",
    "adam stanford and his collaborators for their enlightened approach to the deepest pointing included in our survey that waived all proprietary rights to these data and dr .",
    "leon van speybroeck for contributing three of his gto cluster fields .",
    "elise laird and alan diercks assisted greatly in the construction of our optical data reduction pipeline with useful code and helpful advice .",
    "james chakan assisted with the x - ray data reduction .",
    "this work has been supported by nasa nag5 - 6035(djh ) , as well as by a small _ chandra _ archival grant .",
    "the work of ds was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with nasa .",
    "in table  [ tbl : softcatalog ] we present a source catalog of 879 soft - band serendipitous x - ray sources which lack a statistically significant hard - band counterpart .",
    "these sources are excluded from the main sexsi catalog ( table  [ tbl : catalog ] ) since the strength of sexsi , and thus our primary scientific interest , lies in the study of  source populations .",
    "these soft sources , detected and analyzed as described in section  [ sec : reduction ] , are designated cxosexsi ( our iau - registered name ) followed by standard truncated source coordinates .",
    "the source positions ( equinox j2000.0 ) are those derived from the soft - band x - ray images .",
    "we include only sources detected with a chance coincidence probability of @xmath39 in the soft band .",
    "the angular distance of the source position from the telescope axis is given in column 4 .",
    "columns 5 and 6 list the background - subtracted counts for each source within the specified aperture derived from the 0.5  2.1 kev image , followed by the estimated background counts in that same aperture .",
    "column 7 gives an estimate of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the detection ( see section  [ sec : catalog ] for details ) .",
    "again , it should be emphasized that these values are _ not _ a measure of source significance ( which is @xmath41 in all cases ) but is a measure of the uncertainty in the source flux estimates .",
    "column 8 shows the unabsorbed soft band flux ( with units of @xmath12 ) , corrected for source counts falling outside the aperture and translated to the standard  band assuming a power law photon spectral index of @xmath42 and a galactic absorbing column density appropriate to the field ( see table  [ tbl : fields ] ) .",
    "this soft - band only catalog does have the target sources carefully eliminated for point sources and nearby galaxies , as described for the main sexsi catalog in section  [ sec : srcdeletions ] .",
    "this led to the removal of 86 sources from this catalog .",
    "however , the sources within @xmath33 mpc of target galaxy cluster centroids are not flagged , as was done with the hard sources in table  [ tbl : catalog ] .",
    "in addition , there has been no attempt to search for extended sources .",
