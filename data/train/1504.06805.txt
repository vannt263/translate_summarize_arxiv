    "strange quark stars are hypothetical type of compact exotic stars which are firstly speculated in refs .  @xcite . describing",
    "the structure of stars , including mass @xmath8 and radius ( @xmath1 ) will be available by solving hydrostatic equilibrium equations . in the case of compact stars , due to high density ,",
    "general relativity ( gr ) dominates and newtonian hydrostatic equilibrium should be replaced by its gr counterpart . assuming a static and spherical symmetric geometry and an isotropic matter , einstein field equations lead to tolman@xmath9oppenheimer@xmath9volkoff equation ( tov ) @xcite .",
    "the structure of compact stars has been investigated by refs .",
    "and many others by solving tov equation using a suitable equation of state . now in this paper",
    ", we deal with the strange quark matter ( sqm ) which its eos is well described by mit bag model @xcite .",
    "+ nuclear matter in very high densities can be anisotropic and it is a great motivation to study the effect of anisotropy in the structure of relativistic stars @xcite .",
    "additionally , existing a solid core and a strong magnetic field in neutron stars can be related to anisotropy in the matter of star @xcite .",
    "solving anisotropic tov equation requires a physically reasonable assumption .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite a specific density profile @xmath10 has been chosen and in ref .",
    "@xcite a special metric function @xmath11 has been utilized to solve it analytically .",
    "but in this paper , we try to apply a numerical method for solving modified tov equation by considering a perturbation term .",
    "initially , we consider an isotropic and free charge matter and obtain a solution for radial pressure @xmath12 .",
    "then in anisotropic case we use the previous @xmath12 as the unperturbed solution in order to study @xmath1 and @xmath13 in this kind of stars .",
    "it should be noted that in this work we are dealing with a non - rotating strange quark star but we can expect that rotation allow a larger maximum mass ( about @xmath14 ) according to ref .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we first solve the tov equation for an isotropic matter and then compare it with a charged and anisotropic one .",
    "discussion and concluding remarks are represented in  3 .",
    "for describing mass and radius of a self gravitating configuration in relativistic term we have to consider a suitable metric . the line element in interior of star , assuming a static and spherically symmetric geometry can be written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the light speed while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are spherically symmetric metric functions .",
    "+ in order to obtain a general relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium , we have to solve the einstein equations : @xmath19 for the metric given in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) .",
    "also we must choose a reasonable energy - momentum tensor which satisfies the following conservation law : @xmath20 now in the next subsections we try to obtain the tov equation for two different cases .",
    "first of all we consider an uncharged perfect fluid . the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid is given by @xcite :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the pressure and mass density respectively which are spherical symmetric @xcite .",
    "we also define the gravitational mass as @xcite : @xmath24 by using the above equation , the einstein equations ( [ ein ] ) and the conservation law ( [ cons ] ) for metric ( [ metric ] ) yield to hydrostatic equilibrium equation :    @xmath25    noticeably @xmath26 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are functions of radial coordinate ( _ @xmath27 _ ) .",
    "equation ( [ mm ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ tov ] ) is called tov equation which for its solvability it has to be supplemented by an eos @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the mit bag model for eos of sqm as : @xmath28 according to ref .",
    "@xcite for sqm2 model @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "now we can solve tov equation numerically , using physical boundary conditions @xcite :    @xmath32    in addition , in the stellar interior , following conditions should be satisfied :    @xmath33    conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) are trivial for preserving hydrostatic equilibrium and ( [ cond3 ] ) refers to causality inside the star which does not permit @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eos ] ) @xcite .",
    "also the eos should satisfy the microscopic stability condition ( [ cond4 ] ) , otherwise the star collapses spontaneously@xcite . in the next section",
    "we will use the obtained pressure @xmath35 as the unperturbed radial pressure for anisotropic case .      in this section instead of a perfect fluid",
    "we are dealing with an anisotropic matter .",
    "it means that pressure in radial and tangential directions are not necessarily the same . with this assumption , which is predicted in very high density ranges@xcite , the energy momentum tensor in cgs unit system",
    "will be @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath5 and @xmath7 are tangential and radial pressure respectively .",
    "the gravitational mass which is the total contribution of the energy density takes the new form as @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radial electric field , defined as : @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the charge density . defining @xmath41 as anisotropy factor @xcite , einstein equations ( [ ein ] ) and conservation equation ( [ cons ] ) lead to :    @xmath42    @xmath43    it should be noted that if @xmath44 , in eq .",
    "( [ tova ] ) the magnitude of radial pressure derivative decreases .",
    "this causes a softer falling of radial pressure which results higher maximum masses and their corresponding radii .",
    "equations ( [ mmnew ] ) and ( [ tova ] ) represent the modified form of tov equation .",
    "it is easy to see that putting @xmath45 and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ tova ] ) , simply return uncharged and isotropic cases . in an anisotropic matter ,",
    "mit bag model is @xcite : @xmath47 we should notice that tangential pressure @xmath5 does not necessarily vanish on the surface of star , in contrary to @xmath48@xcite . solving modified tov equation requires some extra assumptions .",
    "assuming that anisotropy has a slight effect on @xmath48 , we add a perturbation to isotropic pressure profile to obtain @xmath48 as : @xmath49 the following perturbation function has to satisfy these boundary conditions :    @xmath50    regarding to eq .",
    "[ assume ] , @xmath51 and @xmath52 have to satisfy mentioned boundary conditions .",
    "so @xmath53 must meet those conditions too .",
    "gaussian function is the simplest choice ( but not the only one which yields no significant difference . ] ) for fulfilment of the conditions [ s1 ] through [ s4 ] by setting the position of gaussian pressure profile at @xmath54 in the following equation : @xmath55 one can see that this gaussian perturbation can satisfy mentioned boundary conditions physically .",
    "we need @xmath56 and its derivative to be nearly zero at origin and also on the surface .",
    "in fact we can tune @xmath57 and @xmath58 so that the perturbation to be so small at those points . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the anisotropy can cause an increase in the radial pressure .",
    "hence we have chosen a positive and small enough value compared to @xmath48 for parameter @xmath57 . eventually studying charged case",
    "requires one more physically assumption . according to ref .",
    "@xcite electrical charge density can be related to the density of matter as follows : @xmath59 which is a physically reasonable assumption@xcite . in this equation @xmath60 is the charge fraction that can be considered @xmath61 @xmath62 to satisfy causality , stability , and electrical neutrality conditions of stars @xcite .",
    "therefore in the most general case ( charged anisotropic matter ) , there is 7 variables namely @xmath63 and 7 equations ( [ mmnew ] ) - ( [ assume ] ) and ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "we have used runge kutta fehlberg fourth - fifth order method ( rkf45 method ) to solve the corresponding coupled ode systems in each cases below :    1 .",
    "isotropic uncharged ( @xmath64 ) , 2 .",
    "isotropic charged ( @xmath65 ) , 3 .",
    "anisotropic uncharged ( @xmath66 ) , 4 .",
    "anisotropic charged ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "in this paper unlike the analytical solutions for anisotropic matter such as ref .  @xcite and ref .  @xcite we have used numerical result of isotropic solution and a gaussian perturbation rather than using a totally assumed function . in the following subsections",
    "we will discuss the result of adding anisotropy and electric charge to tov equations .",
    "our solution indicate that adding positive gaussian anisotropy and electric charge to tov equation increase the maximum mass of neutron star and can predict more massive neutron stars in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "solving modified tov equation reveals that adding electric charge makes the radial pressure @xmath48 to be increased , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_re ] .",
    "but the sensitivity of tangential pressure @xmath68 to the electric charge is much more , so @xmath6 raises up in charged case as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae ] .",
    "this behavior is not only the direct result of our speculation about @xmath48 , but also comes from the nature of tov equation .",
    "[ fig : mmaxe ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : piche ] refer to uncharged and charged isotropic cases .",
    "one may expect adding electric charge to tov equation causes an increase in the maximum mass of strange quark star @xmath0 and also in the corresponding radius @xmath1 for obtained @xmath0 . since in gr gravitational mass of star and total energy are proportional , adding charge density @xmath40 increases the total energy and therefore the above result makes sense .",
    "however , electrical neutrality condition of stars does not allow a significant growth in maximum masses and their corresponding radii .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmax ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pich ] that the maximum mass of strange quark star has been raised by adding gaussian perturbation for obtaining @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae ] the tangential pressure @xmath5 and anisotropy @xmath6 have a maximum and they do not vanish on the surface .",
    "in fact our solution indicate that if there is an anisotropy in the star , it should be maximum on the surface .",
    "+ recent measurements indicate that there exist a pulsar of mass 1.97 @xmath69 0.04 @xmath4 and this mass rules out nearly all currently proposed equations of state@xcite . we have used a trial and error method to get the mentioned mass above .",
    "our calculations indicate that an anisotropy amplitude of @xmath2 with a standard deviation of @xmath3 and @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) can survive sqm equation of state which satisfies boundary and hydrostatic equilibrium conditions by @xmath71 and @xmath72 uncertainties at the origin and on the surface respectively as is depicted in fig .",
