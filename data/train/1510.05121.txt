    "however , the propagation axis of the optical speckle field is disaligned with respect to the optical lattice axes ; this is expected to strongly reduce the role of the correlation anisotropy .",
    "if we consider the geometrically - averaged correlation length , we obtain a gaussian correlation function with similar full width at half maximum as our speckle pattern with @xmath2 ( within @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , in the experiment the density is inhomogeneous due to the confinement ( with approximately @xmath102 particles per lattice well in the trap center , per spin component ) and the energy distribution is not precisely characterized . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we plot the center - of - mass velocities @xmath103 measured in the experiment , as a function of the disorder strength .",

    "we indeed observe that @xmath103 reaches negligible values ( compatible with the experimental resolution ) in the regime where we predict full localization to occur , depending on the details of the optical speckle pattern .",
    "clearly , a quantitative comparison with the experimental data would require a precise characterization of the experimental atomic density and of the energy distribution .",
    "this would also allow us to clarify the potential role played by states in higher - energy bands .",
    "nevertheless , this qualitative agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions is encouraging , and should stimulate further experimental efforts aiming at observing anderson localization in noninteracting atomic gases in disordered optical lattices .",
    "all details of the optical speckle pattern could be included in our theoretical formalism .     of the atomic cloud ( black squares ) as a function of the disorder strength @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 for the tight - binding model , in the top axis ) .",

    "<S> we study the anderson localization of atomic gases exposed to simple - cubic optical lattices with a superimposed disordered speckle pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the two mobility edges in the first band and the corresponding critical filling factors are determined as a function of the disorder strength , ranging from vanishing disorder up to the critical disorder intensity where the two mobility edges merge and the whole band becomes localized . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis is based both on continuous - space models which take into account the details of the spatial correlation of the speckle pattern , and also on a simplified tight - binding model with an uncorrelated distribution of the on - site energies . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility edges are computed via the analysis of the energy - level statistics , and we determine the universal value of the ratio between consecutive level spacings at the mobility edge . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the role of the spatial correlation of the disorder , and we also discuss a qualitative comparison with available experimental data for interacting atomic fermi gases measured in the moderate interaction regime . </S>"
