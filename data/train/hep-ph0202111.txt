    "over one hundred cosmic ray events with energy higher than @xmath2  gev have been detected by past and present observatories .",
    "about 30 events have energy in the range @xmath3  gev ( see  @xcite for an experimental review ) . in top - down production mechanisms of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) the decay products of very massive particles @xmath0 with @xmath4",
    "gev account for these events .",
    "particle x can be either a gut scale particle produced by the decay of a cosmological network of topological defects created in a phase transition in the early universe  @xcite , or a cold dark matter particle clustered in the galactic halo whose abundance was generated during or shortly after inflation  @xcite .",
    "whatever the nature of @xmath0 is , it decays into partons which hadronise and give the uhecr primaries that we observe on the earth .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the predicted spectrum and composition of uhecrs one has to calculate the nonperturbative fragmentation functions ( ffs ) of partons into hadrons at the energy scale @xmath5 .",
    "several approaches have been taken to solve the fragmentation process and calculate the spectrum of uhecrs : montecarlo generators  @xcite , analytical estimates ( mlla )  @xcite and dglap evolution  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a comparison of these different approaches ) .    as long as supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is a low energy symmetry of nature , the decay of @xmath0 will produce supersymmetric particles .",
    "if r - parity is conserved , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and should be among the primary cosmic rays that reach the earth .",
    "theoretical motivations favour the neutralino as  the  lsp , hence we shall concentrate on neutralinos . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with r - parity conserved , neutralinos are a mixture of higgsinos and neutral gauginos ( bino , @xmath6 , and neutral wino , @xmath7 ) . the precise composition of the neutralinos in terms of the interaction eigenstates depends on the particular susy scenario . for simplicity , we shall concentrate on the constrained mssm , which assumes that the soft susy - breaking scalar masses , the gaugino masses and the trilinear parameters are all universal at the gut scale . in this scenario , it can be shown that in the region of the parameter space where the relic density of neutralinos is of cosmological significance , the lsp is mainly a bino @xcite .",
    "weakly interacting particles like neutralinos or neutrinos have cross sections with ordinary matter too small to be detected with present day uhecr observatories . baryons , nuclei and perhaps photons may account for all the events detected so far  @xcite .",
    "forthcoming detectors will be sensitive to weakly interacting uhecrs ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is therefore important to obtain a good estimate of the neutralino flux expected in top - down models .",
    "the neutralino spectrum in top - down models has already been estimated using montecarlo generators by berezinsky&kachelrie  @xcite . in the montecarlo approach",
    "a primary parton with energy @xmath8 produced in the decay of @xmath0 initiates a parton cascade which proceeds until a specific minimal virtuality is reached .",
    "the squarks and gluinos in the parton shower decay into the lsp and ordinary partons once they reach the scale @xmath9 , the universal mass of squarks and gluinos .",
    "all quark and gluons evolve down to the hadronization scale where a phenomenological model is employed to bind them into hadrons .",
    "the montecarlo simulations did not include the electroweak radiation of neutralinos by off - shell partons in the shower . in the next section",
    "we show how the dglap formalism employed to calculate the neutrino , photon and baryon spectra of uhecr  @xcite can be extended to calculate the spectrum of neutralinos .",
    "we concentrate on the electroweak radiation of neutralinos by off - shell partons to complement the montecarlo simulations .",
    "we find that at large @xmath10 electroweak radiation of neutralinos is important .",
    "the large @xmath10 region is the most relevant for future cosmic ray observatories since in this region the neutralino flux is larger than the neutrino flux and will not be swamped by the neutrino signal .",
    "the main channels of neutralino production are the hadronic decays of @xmath0 .",
    "hence the flux of neutralinos is given by the fragmentation functions from partons , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is any quark @xmath13 and squark flavour @xmath14 , a gluon @xmath15 or a gluino @xmath16 .",
    "the flux is proportional to the sum over @xmath12 of @xmath11 each one weighted with the branching ration for the decay of @xmath0 into parton @xmath12 .",
    "the variable @xmath17 is the fraction of the momentum of @xmath12 carried off by @xmath18 .",
    "these nonperturbative functions depend on the energy scale @xmath19 ; in our case @xmath20 .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath21 with @xmath22 is given by the sum of two terms .",
    "the first one takes into account the ordinary susy qcd branching of partons and gives rise to the so - called dokshitzer  gribov ",
    "parisi ( dglap ) equations  @xcite .",
    "the second term takes into account the emission of neutralinos in the parton shower , which stems from the tree level weak susy coupling among quarks , squarks and neutralinos . for any ( anti)quark and ( anti)squark we obtain , to lowest order in the strong coupling @xmath23 and the weak couplings @xmath24 , @xmath25+\\frac{\\alpha^{\\chi , k}_w(\\mu^2)}{2\\pi }    p_{\\chi q_k}(x)\\otimes d^\\chi_\\chi(x,\\mu^2),\\\\    \\label{eq : moddglaps }   \\mu^2\\partial_{\\mu^2 } d^\\chi_{s_k}(x,\\mu^2 ) & = &     \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu^2)}{2\\pi}\\left [ \\sum_l p_{q_ls_k}(x ) \\otimes      d^\\chi_{q_l}(x,\\mu^2 ) + \\dots \\right]+\\frac{\\alpha^{\\chi , k}_w(\\mu^2)}{2\\pi }    p_{\\chi s_k}(x)\\otimes d^\\chi_\\chi(x,\\mu^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dots inside the square brackets stand for the remaining leading order susy qcd terms .",

    "the wino will eventually decay into the bino , the lsp .",

    "so far we have ignored higgsino production , so some words are now in order .",
    "the magnitude of the gaugino and higgsino couplings to partons are comparable , hence their ffs will be also similar .",
    "for the benchmark points that we have analysed , higgsinos will decay on their way to the earth into winos and subsequently into binos . therefore , for the same kinematical reason as the wino case discussed above , the total number of binos on earth coming from higgsino decay will be a small correction to the direct bino contribution , for @xmath93 .",
    "for the same reason , we have ignored binos coming from the decay of the charginos that are also produced in the parton shower .",

    "the baryon and neutrino curves are obtained from ref .",
    "the neutralino spectrum shown corresponds to benchmark point c in ref .",
    "the final neutralino spectrum does not depend significantly on which benchmark point we choose , since the dominant contribution in the region of interest is given by the bino component produced directly by @xmath0 .",
