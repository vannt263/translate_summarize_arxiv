    "spatial ( or space - time ) dimensionality , topology , and symmetry are central concepts in physics .",
    "this article studies a phenomenon , that of _ dimensional reduction _ or _ holographic correspondences _ , that highlights how these concepts may come together to produce particularly striking signatures .",
    "the dimension of a system is one of its most basic characteristics and typically represents an important measure of its complexity .",
    "dimensional reduction and holographic correspondences refer to the fact that the  apparent \" , or  obvious \" dimension @xmath1 of a system may not be the dimension @xmath2 , @xmath3 , that best characterizes its response to experimental probes and its information content .",
    "we speak of dimensional reduction when the observable physical properties of a system in @xmath1 dimensions behave as if it were @xmath2-dimensional .",
    "we argue for a holographic correspondence when two systems of different dimensionality seem capable of storing and processing comparable amounts of information .",
    "both notions , often undistinguished in current literature , appear in numerous fields including condensed matter , cold atom , high - energy , and black - hole physics . given the cross - disciplinary nature of the subject there is a need to better understand the physical and mathematical basis of dimensional reduction and holographic correspondences .",
    "we believe that this understanding should be rooted in basic principles than in properties of specific models .",
    "this article constitutes an attempt to study _ exact _ and _ effective _ dimensional reductions , and holographic correspondences within a unified framework .",
    "our approach relies on the recent theory of dualities @xcite , and a new theorem that constrains arbitrary correlators of a quantum theory in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the obtained inequalities and bounds afford a practical notion of effective dimensional reduction because they are specified by homologous correlators of an associated , _",
    "local _ , @xmath3 dimensional theory .",
    "also they become specially useful in the presence of _",
    "@xmath4-dimensional gauge - like symmetries _",
    "( or @xmath5-glss for short ) @xcite , with @xmath6 , a geometrically distinguished set of symmetries that we will discuss further below",
    ". the notion of _ exact _ dimensional reduction is further linked to the existence of a duality , mapping the @xmath1-dimensional theory to a @xmath2-dimensional one . in such situations inequalities may be replaced by exact equalities .",
    "we also introduce the concept of _ dimensional reduction by the density of states _ , a concept that may find its way to practical applications in the form of either exact or effective versions , depending on the problem .",
    "we illustrate this technique with @xmath7 type vector theories .",
    "finally , we will show that exact dimensional reduction is sometimes connected to a _ holographic - like entropy _ that scales as the surface of the system , and use large-@xmath0 vector theories to illustrate this point .",
    "remarkably , our take on dimensional reduction / holographic correspondences will allow us to discuss limitations on the storage and robustness of quantum information .    while dimensional reduction / holographic correspondences may seem to be exotic phenomena , they can in fact appear in many systems as the natural consequence of a wealth of physical mechanisms :    \\(1 ) _ restrictions from conservation laws .",
    "_ in some cases , a conservation law ( that can be formalized as a gauge constraint ) favors _ sliding _ dynamics along preferred directions while forbidding motion along other directions .",
    "for example , the glide principle @xcite for elastic solids dictates that dislocations move preferentially along directions that are determined by their topological charges or burger s vectors .",
    "\\(2 ) _ reduced kinetics and interactions along one or more directions . _ in many condensed matter systems a dimensional reduction can occur due to the _ confinement _ of electrons / atoms along planes or lines ( e.g. , wires ) , whereby certain directions become irrelevant . _",
    "reduced tunneling _ , for instance , can appear along certain directions , as in the case of high-@xmath8 cuprates and some other layered systems , due to relatively large separation between planes that suppresses interplane couplings and tunneling from one layer to the next .",
    "similar decoupling can occur in magnetic systems with _",
    "spin exchange interactions _ on geometrically frustrated lattices @xcite , where the coupling between planes ( or other lower - dimensional subvolumes ) along one or more directions becomes negligible . in all of these systems ,",
    "the effective physical interactions and/or kinetic hopping matrix elements describe a lower - dimensional system .",
    "many of these systems are locally inhomogeneous with electrons constrained in some way , but at large distances the symmetry between different directions is restored .",
    "that is , in such cases , converse to the kaluza - klein type compactifications that we list next , _",
    "dimensional reduction may _ ( but need not ) _ emerge at local scales_. at short distance scales the system is effectively of a lower dimensionality than it is at large distance scales .",
    "\\(3 ) _ kaluza - klein compactification .",
    "_ dimensional reduction can be achieved geometrically by compactifying @xmath9 spatial dimensions of a theory through the kaluza - klein @xcite procedure . at low energies or temperatures , excitations along these `` small dimensions '' are suppressed , leading to an effective @xmath2-dimensional theory .",
    "that is , _ dimensional reduction emerges at low energies and large distances_. this type of dimensional reduction is important in string @xcite and supergravity theories , and it has been suggested recently @xcite that may also help to address the langlands duality which is an open problem in basic mathematics .",
    "\\(4 ) _ gravity - gauge dualities ( ads - cft)_. a seemingly different , more subtle , and very powerful form of dimensional reduction is offered by the ads - cft ( or more general gravity - gauge ) holographic correspondences ( dualities ) .",
    "this correspondence relates , via a putative strong - weak coupling duality , different theories : string theory as a theory of quantum gravity on an anti de sitter ( ads ) background in @xmath1 dimensions , and a conformal field theory ( cft ) in @xmath10 space - time dimensions . since its initial discovery @xcite",
    ", the ads - cft correspondence @xcite has been a source of inspiration for many ideas and applications .",
    "apart from its original use in string theory , as a gravity - gauge correspondence @xcite , it has led to many other applications that include hadronic hydrodynamics @xcite and fundamental questions relating to transport in strongly correlated systems @xcite .",
    "similar forms of an ads - cft type correspondence were conjectured for cold atom systems with schrdinger type dynamics @xcite .    this incomplete list of known mechanisms underscores the multitude of disparate phenomena that may lead to dimensional reduction and holographic - like correspondences .",
    "this article will describe simple tools that can help address this diversity in a coherent way . as mentioned already",
    ", we distinguish between two scenarios :    \\(i ) _ effective dimensional reduction .",
    "_ this possibility has , for the most part , not been explored before ( especially in quantum theories ) , and forms a cornerstone of this article .",
    "items ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) above can be seen as realizations of this type of dimensional reduction .",
    "we will illustrate how inequalities with bounds on arbitrary correlation functions , typically strengthened by the presence of @xmath11-glss , relate to an effective dimensional reduction .",
    "\\(ii ) _ exact dimensional reduction .",
    "_ we identify this scenario with the existence of dualities connecting theories of different dimensionality .",
    "these dualities may be exact or asymptotically so in some limit ( such as the large-@xmath0 limit or the weak coupling limit ) .",
    "case ( 4 ) is often conjectured to be exact yet still largely remains to be proved .",
    "the ads - cft correspondence has , however , been convincingly established in the large-@xmath0 limit and several related @xmath12 matrix and other models .    in general ,",
    "an effective dimensional reduction is very different in nature from an _ exact _ dimensional reduction , whence the spectrum of a @xmath1-dimensional system attains a form akin to that of a theory in @xmath13 dimensions with local interactions . in this paper , this _ effective _ scenario is characterized in terms of a flexible formalism that can describe a range of situations that go from  very weak \" to  very strong \" dimensional reduction .",
    "it is essential then to recognize ingredients that will favor the strongest forms of effective dimensional reduction .",
    "symmetries , and more specifically , the @xmath4-glss that we describe in the next section , are one such ingredient . in such cases ,",
    "those symmetries mandate how the bounding @xmath11-dimensional correlation functions decay with distance .",
    "the concept of exact dimensional reduction ( ii ) is more restrictive , and its connection to @xmath14-gls is less clearly understood . if an _",
    "exact _ equivalence is present between all possible correlation functions in two different theories then it will be natural to conjecture that a duality ( i.e. , an exact unitary mapping @xcite ) connects the theory that displays lower- ( @xmath2 ) dimensional behavior , yet described as high- ( @xmath1 ) dimensional theory , to a dual theory explicitly @xmath2-dimensional .",
    "then the inequalities saturate and become equalities .",
    "this occurs , for instance , in some special models @xcite , such as kitaev s model @xcite , that may be constructed and solved using these unitary mappings .",
    "as we will show , this occurs far more generally in the large-@xmath0 limit of rather general @xmath7 type vector theories .",
    "the crux of this result is that in systems such as large-@xmath0 vector theories , the partition function ( or generating functional ) of the system can be expressed in terms of an effective density of states functional .",
    "transformations between systems that reside in different ( space / space - time ) dimensions that preserve this density of states , while maintaining the locality of the theory , automatically correspond to ( dimension reducing ) duality transformations .",
    "we expect , though , that the most complex cases of dimensional reduction / holographic correspondences may be understood as the combined use of ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the results reported in this work hold for a very broad class of systems . throughout",
    ", we will consider arbitrary quantum systems ( or their classical descendants ) in @xmath1- spatial ( or space - time ) dimensions with hilbert spaces which are either finite or denumerably infinite .",
    "the theories to be directly analyzed are defined on a @xmath1-dimensional lattice of _ volume _ @xmath15 . when alluded to",
    ", continuum field theories will be understood to be represented by the continuum ( vanishing lattice size @xmath16 ) limit of an appropriately defined lattice field theory regularizing it .",
    "the hamiltonians ( or euclidean actions ) of the systems that we address have interactions _ local _ in space ( or space - time ) , i.e. , have couplings that veer to zero at large spatial ( or temporal ) separations . in the thermodynamic ( @xmath17 )",
    "limit we will , at times , replace pertinent sums over the fourier modes @xmath18 associated with lattice systems by corresponding integrations over the first brillouin zone . for instance , in the case of a square lattice system , @xmath19 with @xmath20 the linear lattice size along the @xmath21 direction , @xmath22 , @xmath23 being integers , with @xmath16 the lattice constant .",
    "the first brillouin zone is spanned by @xmath24 .",
    "symmetries represent an important element of our analysis .",
    "the most general symmetry @xmath25 of a system with a hamiltonian @xmath26 can be described as a direct sum of arbitrary unitary transformations @xmath27 that act non - trivially only on their corresponding subspaces of fixed energy @xmath28 and of dimension @xmath29 .",
    "that is , the direct sum of unitary transformations @xmath30 constitutes a symmetry of the system , i.e. , @xmath31 , for arbitrary @xmath27 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath25 is a symmetry and @xmath32 is the spectral decomposition of @xmath26 , then @xmath25 has the structure of eq . above , with @xmath33",
    "typically , unitary operations of the type of eq . ( [ t ] ) may correspond to non - local operations .",
    "_ in contrast , the symmetries that are most relevant to dimensional reduction have well defined spatial support_.    this observation ( that will be illustrated often in this paper ) leads to the notion of @xmath14-glss . as alluded to earlier , these are symmetry operations ( of codimension @xmath34 ) that act non - trivially only within a @xmath14-dimensional physical space .",
    "technically , a symmetry is termed @xmath14-gls if fields acted on by the symmetry operators @xmath35 are affected within a region of @xmath5-dimensional support @xcite .",
    "for instance , local ( gauge ) symmetries are of dimension @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , global symmetry operators act on all of the fields of the system and thus their dimension is @xmath37 ( that of the entire system ) . in between these two extremes of local ( @xmath36 ) and global ( @xmath37 ) symmetries there is an intermediate regime where the symmetry operators act on a @xmath38 dimensional spatial region .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that @xmath14-glss can mandate the appearance of topological quantum order ( tqo ) @xcite . in continuum space - time @xmath14-glss",
    "may asymptotically include , as a particular case , the conformal symmetries that appear in conformal fields theories ( cfts ) but are not limited to these",
    ".    it will be useful in the following to keep in mind specific simple examples for which our theorems have easy to grasp yet non - trivial consequences .",
    "the spin @xmath39 , @xmath40 compass model @xcite on a square lattice is one of many such examples .",
    "it is often specified by the hamiltonian @xmath41 with exchange couplings @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are pauli operators located at the lattice site @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "its @xmath46-glss @xmath47 ( @xmath48=0=[h_{\\sf compass},y_{i^2}]$ ] ) satisfy the algebra @xmath49=[y_{i^2},y_{{i^2}'}]=0 . \\label{algxy}\\ ] ] the xu - moore model @xcite , studied before in connection to dimensional reduction , is dual to the compass model @xcite .",
    "as explained in the introduction , our approach to _ effective dimensional reduction _ is based on inequalities .",
    "these inequalities are the subject of a theorem on an effective quantum dimensional reduction ( eqdr ) that we prove in this section",
    ".    intuitively speaking , a system is intrinsically @xmath1-dimensional if it can not be simulated by a lower - dimensional one ( a higher - dimensional simulator is always possible provided some redundancy is allowed @xcite ) .",
    "this idea provides the basis for a good definition of _ intrinsically @xmath1-dimensional _ , but fails to provide simple , practical criteria to search for dimensional reduction .",
    "the eqdr theorem provides one such criterion .",
    "the idea is that @xmath1-dimensional systems have observables @xmath50 that specifically probe @xmath2-dimensional sub - volumes @xmath51 , @xmath52 , of the @xmath1-dimensional space @xmath15 .",
    "the eqdr theorem illustrates that under certain ( not very stringent ) conditions , the expectation values of these @xmath2-dimensional observables are both bounded from above and from below by expectation values taken within _ effective _ @xmath2-dimensional theories .",
    "thus , we can use the behavior of these bounds ( e.g. , how stringent they are for specific theories ) as indicators to search for effective dimensional reduction . as stressed in the introduction ,",
    "the eqdr theorem becomes most useful in the presence of suitable * d*-glss .",
    "the eqdr theorem exploits features of quantum mechanics that force us to reconsider the notion of _",
    "localizability_. this notion poses a problem that was perhaps first fully appreciated in the context of entanglement @xcite but was also carefully considered in connection to the notion of particle ( more specifically , the position of a particle ) in quantum field theory @xcite . remarkably , the notions of localizability that emerged from those two lines of inquiry are ( as far as we can see ) conceptually different , and exploit different mathematical structures on the space of states . hence , in order to apply the eqdr theorem to quantum field theories and many - body systems we need to introduce a redundant representation of the state space of identical particles , and keep the constraint of indistinguishability explicit in the form of a projector onto subspaces of completely ( anti)symmetric state vectors .",
    "this enables us to treat fermions and bosons . in the current work",
    ", we do not discuss the extension of the eqdr theorem to systems with anyon statistics .",
    "the eqdr theorem is inspired by an analogous theorem for classical statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "hence it is convenient to review briefly this theorem on classical dimensional reduction to motivate its quantum analogues and to introduce some useful notation .",
    "consider a _",
    "classical _ model of statistical mechanics that , for concreteness , has its degrees of freedom defined on the sites of a lattice @xmath53 .",
    "the lattice provides a _ set of labels_. in the following , we will loosely allude to @xmath51 as `` the boundary '' of the system and to @xmath54 as `` the bulk '' of the system .",
    "the elementary degrees of freedom of the model can be organized into a lattice field @xmath55 ( @xmath45 denotes a site of the lattice ) that can be broken up into two fields with disjoint supports , @xmath56 , @xmath57    if @xmath50 is a classical observable with support on @xmath51 then we can write @xmath58=f[\\phi_{0}]$ ] so that its canonical ensemble average is @xmath59\\frac{e^{-\\beta e[\\phi_0,\\psi]}}{\\mathcal{z } } = \\sum_{\\{\\psi\\}}\\   \\frac{z[\\psi]}{\\mathcal{z}}\\ \\frac { \\sum_{\\{\\phi_0\\}}f(\\phi_0)e^{-\\beta e[\\phi_0,\\psi]}}{z[\\psi]}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60=e[\\phi_0,\\psi]$ ] is the energy functional , @xmath61}$ ] , with @xmath62 where @xmath63 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath64={\\sum_{\\{\\phi_0\\}}e^{-\\beta e[\\phi_0,\\psi]}}$ ] .",

    "\\langle f\\rangle^d_u \\equiv { \\sf max}_{\\psi}\\ \\langle f\\rangle^d[\\psi ] = \\langle f\\rangle^d[\\psi_{\\sf max}].\\ ] ] it then follows from eq . that @xcite @xmath69    the key observation is that we can think of these bounds as averages for effective @xmath2-dimensional theories",
    "moreover , these theories are characterized by _ local _ energy functionals @xmath70 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ \\   e_u[\\phi_0,\\psi_{\\sf max}].\\ ] ] thus , the inequalities of eq . afford a classical notion of _ effective _ dimensional reduction .",
    "for some systems , it is , to a certain extent , a matter of taste whether we choose to call these inequalities `` classical '' or `` quantum '' as they are directly applicable to _ lattice _",
    "quantum field theory in the euclidean path - integral representation @xcite . however , the path - integral formalism is not always convenient , and some subtleties may arise when this formalism is applied to quantum theories with a boundary .",
    "thus we would like to understand next how to extend this type of reasoning to the operator formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "suppose that we have a quantum system occupying a @xmath1-dimensional spatial volume @xmath15 .",
    "this system is described by the density matrix @xmath71 that we take to be completely arbitrary for now ( in particular , it could be time dependent ) .",
    "that is , the density matrix @xmath71 is solely required to be a positive and normalized @xmath72 operator acting on the state space @xmath73 , with @xmath74 denoting the trace on @xmath75 . a natural question to ask",
    "is whether @xmath71 should play in the quantum arena a role similar to that played by the boltzmann probability distribution in the classical setting .",
    "another important question is `` what does it mean for a quantum observable @xmath50 to be localized on @xmath51 ? '' .",
    "the answer to the latter question depends on how the _ set _",
    "decomposition @xmath76 of the labels is reflected in the state space @xmath73 . if , _ for whatever physical reason _",
    ", the hilbert space associated with the entire system can be expressed as a direct product of the spaces associated with the boundary and bulk , @xmath77 i.e. , _ if the boundary @xmath51 and bulk @xmath54 are distinguishable _",
    ", then we can use the standard notion of subsystems in quantum mechanics to say that @xmath50 _ is localized on @xmath51 _ provided that @xmath78 once we agree on this notion of localizability , the eqdr theorem follows from a simple direct computation involving partial traces .",
    "first we notice that @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the _ partial _ trace operation that takes an operator on @xmath81 to an operator on the state space for the bulk , and @xmath82 denotes the standard trace on @xmath83 .",
    "equation is analogous to the first part of eq . in the classical case . to reproduce the second part ,",
    "_ we assume that the reduced operator @xmath84 is invertible _ , so that we can write @xmath85\\big).\\ ] ] very loosely speaking , in such a case , we can think of @xmath86 as a  conditional probability \" where the conditions pertain to the quantum states of the bulk .",
    "explicitly , the reduced operator @xmath84 can be decomposed in terms of pure states of the bulk as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the projector onto the eigenspace with the eigenvalue @xmath89 .",
    "this ( positive ) eigenvalue represents the probability to find the bulk in the state @xmath88 .",

    "eq . in the classical dimensional reduction theorem ,",
    "notice that eq . expresses the classical average as a conditional expectation value weighted by the probabilities for different possible bulk configurations .",
    "equation has a similar structure .",
    "however , while the left - hand side of eq . is real by construction , the quantities @xmath91\\big)$ ] need not be real valued since the operator @xmath92 need not , in general , be hermitian .",
    "[ this holds even if we assume that @xmath50 is hermitian ( an assumption that we will not invoke ) ] .",
    "later on , it will be useful to consider the situation when @xmath50 is normal ( @xmath93=0 $ ] ) .",

    "it is interesting to notice , however , that the boltzmann distribution can not be ( easily ) extended to gravitational systems @xcite already in their classical incarnation .",

    "the explicit description of the fock space shows that there is a difficulty in applying the eqdr theorem to quantum field theory directly , since in this case the decomposition @xmath53 of the set of labels into bulk and boundary is not readily reflected in the decomposition of @xmath118 into a tensor product as in eq . .",
    "to find a solution to this problem , let us imagine for a moment that the particles in the bulk @xmath54 are _ distinguishable _ from the particles in the boundary @xmath51 , keeping however the particles in the boundary ( bulk ) indistinguishable .",
