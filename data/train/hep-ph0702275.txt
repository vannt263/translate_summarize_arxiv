    "since many years , the @xmath14 system receives a lot of attention in the @xmath15-physics community ( for a review , see @xcite ) . thanks to the interplay between theory and the @xmath15-factory data , valuable new insights into the physics of these modes",
    "could be obtained , raising also the question of having an electroweak ( ew ) penguin sector that is modified by the presence of cp - violating new - physics ( np ) contributions @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall perform an analysis of the @xmath14 modes in the spirit of the strategy developed in @xcite , and will , in particular , address the new data that were reported by the @xmath15-factory experiments babar ( slac ) and belle ( kek ) in the summer of 2006 .",
    "the corresponding working assumptions for the treatment of the hadronic @xmath14 sector can be summarised as follows :    * _ @xmath6 flavour symmetry : _ @xmath6-breaking effects are , however , included through ratios of decay constants and form factors whenever they arise , and the sensitivity of the numerical results on non - factorizable @xmath6-breaking effects is explored .",
    "* _ neglect of the penguin annihilation and exchange topologies : _ these contributions can be probed and controlled through the @xmath16 , @xmath17 system @xcite , which can be fully exploited at the lhcb ( cern ) experiment .",
    "the data support these hypotheses , as all consistency checks that can currently be performed do not indicate any anomalous behaviour .",
    "the following analysis is essentially a study within the standard model ( sm ) , with the goal to perform tests of the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( km ) mechanism of cp violation @xcite .",
    "however , also the effects of np can straightforwardly be explored if we assume that it manifests itself only in the ew penguin sector .",
    "this scenario was , on the one hand , driven by the comparison of the @xmath15-factory data for the @xmath4 observables with their sm predictions .",
    "on the other hand , such a kind of physics beyond the sm can also be accommodated in various specific frameworks , including supersymmetry , models with extra @xmath18 bosons , and scenarios with extra dimensions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : the starting point of our analysis , the @xmath19 system , is discussed in section  [ sec : bpipi ] . in section  [ sec : bpik ] , we then move on to the @xmath4 decays .",
    "finally , our main conclusions and a brief outlook are given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the @xmath19 system consists of the decays @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and their charge conjugates .",
    "as is well known , the corresponding decay amplitudes can be related to one another with the help of the @xmath22 isospin symmetry @xcite , which allows us also to take the effects of ew penguin topologies into account @xcite .",
    "we shall come back to this feature below .",
    "let us first have a closer look at the cp violation in the @xmath0 channel , which receives contributions from tree and penguin diagrams in the sm .",
    "the corresponding decay amplitude can be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath23,\\ ] ] where the @xmath24 amplitude is governed by the colour - allowed tree topologies , @xmath25 is the usual angle of the unitarity triangle , and the cp - conserving hadronic parameter @xmath26 describes  sloppily speaking  the ratio of penguin to tree contributions .",
    "the interference between the different weak amplitudes in ( [ api+pi- ] ) leads to a _",
    "cp asymmetry @xmath27 , whereas the interference between @xmath28@xmath29 mixing and the @xmath30 decay processes generates a _ mixing - induced _ cp asymmetry @xmath31 .",
    "these observables enter the following time - dependent cp asymmetry @xcite : @xmath32 as in @xcite , we shall use a sign convention similar to that of ( [ acp - timedep ] ) also for self - tagging neutral @xmath33 and charged @xmath15 decays coincides with @xmath34 but our @xmath35 differs in sign from @xmath36 @xcite ] .    concerning the measurement of cp violation in @xmath0",
    ", there has been interesting recent progress .",
    "there is now  for the first time  a nice agreement between the babar and belle results for the mixing - induced cp asymmetry : @xmath37 which yields the average of @xmath38 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the picture of direct cp violation is still _ not _ settled : @xmath39     in ( [ gam ] ) with the sm fit of the unitarity triangle obtained by the utfit collaboration @xcite ; the situation is analogous for the corresponding analysis of the ckmfitter collaboration @xcite . ]",
    "this unsatisfactory situation can be resolved with the help of the @xmath1 mode , which receives  in analogy to the @xmath0 channel  also contributions from tree and penguin topologies . however , since @xmath1 is caused by @xmath40 quark - level transitions , it exhibits an amplitude hierarchy which is different from that of the @xmath41 decay @xmath0 , and is actually dominated by the qcd penguin topologies .",
    "direct cp violation in this decay , which is generated through the interference between the penguin and tree contributions , is now experimentally well established : @xmath42 leading to the average of @xmath43 @xcite . in the sm , we may write @xmath44,\\ ] ] where the penguin amplitude @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which measures  sloppily speaking  the ratio of tree to penguin contributions , are cp - conserving strong quantities . using the @xmath6 flavour symmetry and the dynamical assumptions specified in section  [ sec : intro ] , we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 involves the usual wolfenstein parameter @xcite , which implies the following relation @xcite : @xmath49 = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\left[\\frac{{\\cal a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp   k^\\pm)}{{\\cal a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}(b_d\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-)}\\right].\\ ] ] since the cp - averaged branching ratios and the direct cp violation in @xmath1 are well measured @xcite , we may use this relation to _ predict _ the direct cp asymmetry @xmath50 which favours the babar result in ( [ acp - dir - pipi - ex ] ) . furthermore , as the @xmath28@xmath29 mixing phase @xmath51 is known through the cp violation measurements in @xmath52 @xcite , the quantities @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be expressed in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , these parameters can be extracted from the data .",
    "as far as the angle @xmath25 is concerned , we obtain @xmath58 which is in nice agreement with the sm fits of the unitarity triangle @xcite , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : utfit ] . for the remainder of this analysis",
    ", we will use the value of @xmath25 in ( [ gam ] ) .      concerning the determination of the ratio of the penguin to tree amplitudes of the @xmath0 decay as described above",
    ", we find @xmath59 the @xmath19 system offers two more channels . using the isospin symmetry of strong interactions",
    ", their decay amplitudes can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath60\\\\ \\sqrt{2}a(b^0_d\\to\\pi^0\\pi^0)&=&|p|e^{i\\delta_p } \\left[1+(x / d)e^{i\\gamma}e^{i(\\delta-\\theta)}\\right],\\label{api0pi0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the hadronic parameter @xmath61 denotes the ratio of  colour - suppressed \" to `` colour - allowed tree '' amplitudes .",
    "since we have two more @xmath19 observables at our disposal , @xmath62\\frac{\\tau_{b^0_d}}{\\tau_{b^+ } } = 2.02\\pm0.16\\\\ r_{00}^{\\pi\\pi}&\\equiv&2\\left[\\frac{\\mbox{br}(b_d\\to\\pi^0\\pi^0)}{\\mbox{br } ( b_d\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-)}\\right ] = 0.50\\pm0.08,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also given the most recent experimental averages @xcite , @xmath63 and the strong phase @xmath64 can be determined : @xmath65    if we use ( [ api0pi0 ] ) and complement ( [ x - delta ] ) with the numbers in ( [ phid ] ) , ( [ gam ] ) and ( [ d - theta ] ) , the cp asymmetries of the @xmath21 channel can be _ predicted _ in the sm . following these lines",
    ", we obtain the numbers @xmath66 which offer the exciting perspective of observing _",
    "cp violation in this decay .",
    "so far , only data for the direct cp asymmetry are available from the babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations , yielding the following average @xcite : @xmath67 although this result is still compatible with zero at the 1.1 @xmath68 level , the agreement with ( [ acpdir00 ] ) ( note the sign ) is nevertheless very encouraging and gives us further confidence in our analysis .",
    "let us finally note that also the ew penguin contributions are included in our numerical values with the help of the isospin symmetry @xcite , although they have a tiny impact on the @xmath19 system .",
    "let us now turn to our main target , which is given by the @xmath4 system .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 mode , it consists of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , as well as their charge conjugates . in the sm , all these decays are governed by their qcd penguin contributions . however",
    ", also ew penguins may play an important rle .",
    "we distinguish between the following cases :    * _ colour - suppressed _ ew penguins with tiny effects : @xmath1 , @xmath69 . *",
    "_ colour - allowed _ ew penguins with sizeable effects : @xmath70 , @xmath71 .    in the latter case , the ew penguin contributions are even comparable to those of colour - allowed tree topologies .",
    "let us first have a closer look at those @xmath4 observables that are marginally affected by ew penguins .        in subsection  [ ssec :",
    "clarify ] , we have already used the cp - averaged branching ratio and the direct cp asymmetry of the @xmath72 channel . as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : utfit ] , the resulting value of @xmath25 in ( [ gam ] ) agrees nicely with the sm fits of the unitarity triangle .",
    "however , there is another decay with tiny ( colour - suppressed ) ew penguin contributions at our disposal , the @xmath69 channel . in the sm",
    ", its decay amplitude can be written as @xmath73,\\ ] ] where the cp - conserving hadronic parameter @xmath74 is doubly cabibbo - suppressed and , hence , usually neglected . in this limit , we obviously have vanishing direct cp violation in @xmath69 .",

    "it is interesting to note that a similar picture of @xmath77 follows also from the recently observed @xmath78 decays @xcite .",
    "consequently , toy models of final - state interaction effects yielding a significant enhancement of the @xmath77 parameter that were discussed several years ago are now strongly disfavoured out by the @xmath15-factory data .      as an interesting by - product",
    ", the strategy developed in @xcite allows us to predict the observables of the @xmath5 decay , where the ( colour - suppressed ) ew penguin contributions have again a tiny impact . using the sm value of the @xmath79@xmath80 mixing phase @xmath81 @xcite , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the usual parameters of the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite , we arrive at the following predictions of the cp asymmetries : @xmath84 in the case of the cp - averaged branching ratio",
    ", an @xmath6-breaking form - factor ratio enters the prediction , thereby increasing the uncertainties .",
    "if we use the result of a qcd sum - rule calculation @xcite , we obtain @xmath85 the @xmath5 channel was recently observed by the cdf collaboration @xcite ; the most recent experimental result for the cp - averaged branching ratio reads as follows @xcite : @xmath86 within the uncertainties , ( [ bskk - br ] ) is in nice agreement with ( [ bskk - exp ] ) , which is another support of the working hypotheses listed in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "the @xmath87 , @xmath88 system offers a strategy for the extraction of @xmath25 with the help of the @xmath89-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions @xcite , which can nicely be implemented at the lhcb experiment @xcite .",
    "the predictions and hadronic parameters given above are useful for further experimental studies in the preparation for the quickly approaching start of the lhc .",
    "let us now focus on those cp - conserving @xmath4 observables that are sizeably affected by ew penguin contributions . in this context , the following ratios @xcite have received a lot of attention in the literature : @xmath90=1.11\\pm0.07\\\\ r_{\\rm n}&\\equiv&\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\frac{\\mbox{br}(b_d^0\\to\\pi^- k^+)+\\mbox{br}(\\bar b_d^0\\to\\pi^+   k^-)}{\\mbox{br}(b_d^0\\to\\pi^0k^0)+\\mbox{br}(\\bar b_d^0\\to\\pi^0\\bar k^0 ) } \\right]=0.99\\pm0.07,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also given the experimental averages @xcite , taking the most recent measurements by the babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations into account . in these quantities ,",

    "following @xcite , let us now discuss the situation in the plane of @xmath95 and @xmath94 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnrc ] . here",
    "the various contours correspond to different values of @xmath91 , and the position on the contour is parametrized through the cp - violating phase @xmath92 .",
    "we observe that the sm prediction ( on the right - hand side ) is very stable in time , having now significantly reduced errors . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath15-factory data have moved quite a bit towards the sm , thereby reducing the  @xmath4 puzzle \" for the cp - averaged branching ratios .",
    "a similar trend is also seen in the measurements of cp violation in @xmath96 penguin - dominated decays @xcite , where in particular the average value of @xmath97 has moved towards the reference value of @xmath98 .",
    "if we convert the experimental values of @xmath95 and @xmath94 into @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath99 in comparison with the situation of the ratio @xmath100 discussed in subsection  [ sssec : bpik - mixed ] , the agreement between the new data for the @xmath7 and their sm predictions is not as perfect .",
    "however , a case for a modified ew penguin sector can not be made through the new measurements of these quantities .",

    "let us first turn to the neutral decay , which offers an interesting probe for np @xcite . within the sm , we obtain the following predictions : @xmath102 which are much sharper than the current @xmath15-factory data : @xmath103 @xmath104 yielding the following averages @xcite : @xmath105 in analogy to fig .  [ fig : rnrc ]",
    ", we show the situation in the @xmath106@xmath107 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : acp ] .",
    "we see that @xmath106 offers a particularly interesting observable , and that the experimental central values can be reached for large _ positive _ values of @xmath92 .    concerning direct cp violation in @xmath9",

    "consequently , the non - vanishing experimental value of @xmath110 which differs from zero at the @xmath111 level , is likely to be generated through hadronic effects , i.e.  not through the impact of physics beyond the sm .",

    "the large value of @xmath91 would be excluded by constraints from rare decays in simple scenarios where np enters only through @xmath115 penguins @xcite , but could still be accommodated in other scenarios , e.g.  in models with leptophobic @xmath18 bosons .      in analogy to the detailed discussion in @xcite , we have also explored the sensitivity of our new numerical results on @xmath6-breaking effects .",
    "the resulting picture is essentially the same : even if we allow for very conservative uncertainties in the @xmath6-breaking effects , the resulting uncertainties on our predictions are only very moderately increased with respect to our standard analysis , the @xmath6-breaking corrections never become dominant over the other sources of uncertainty .    for numerical details ,",
    "we refer the reader to the discussion in @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that even our standard analysis takes into account a reasonable estimate of @xmath6-breaking related uncertainties which are included in all the theoretical errors quoted in this paper .",
    "the @xmath14 system remains a particularly interesting playground for the testing of the km mechanism of cp violation , and the systematic strategy developed in @xcite continues to provide a powerful tool for the theoretical interpretation of the corresponding @xmath15-factory data .",
    "the recent experimental progress allows us now to use only data where the results of the babar and belle collaborations are in full agreement with each other .",
    "interestingly , the resulting sm picture is very stable , with almost unchanged central values since the original analysis of 2003 , and significantly reduced errors .    in our new analysis ,",
    "we pointed out that the branching ratio and direct cp asymmetry of the @xmath1 decay allow us to clarify the still unsatisfactory situation of the measurements of the direct cp violation in @xmath0 :          * all modes with colour - suppressed ew penguins are found in excellent agreement with the sm . * the data for the @xmath116 have moved quite a bit towards the sm predictions , which are almost unchanged , thereby strongly reducing the  @xmath4 puzzle \" for the cp - averaged branching ratios . * on the other hand , the mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath8 still looks puzzling , and can straightforwardly be accommodated through a modified ew penguin sector with a large , positive value of the cp - violating np phase @xmath92 . *",
    "the non - zero experimental value of @xmath117 in ( [ delta - a ] ) seems to be caused by hadronic and not by np effects .    unfortunately , we still can not draw definite conclusions about the presence of np in the @xmath4 system ( and other @xmath96 penguin decays , such as @xmath118 )",
    ". it will be interesting to keep track of the picture of these decays once the data improve further .",
