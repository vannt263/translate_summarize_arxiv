    "symmetries are fundamental features of the differential equations of mathematical physics .",
    "it yield a number of useful properties such as integrability of odes , symmetry reduction of pdes , existence of various types invariant solutions , conservation laws for the invariant variational problems etc . therefore ,",
    "preserving symmetries in discrete schemes , we retain qualitative properties of the underlying differential equations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop the entire set of invariant difference schemes for the heat transfer equation @xmath3 for all special cases of the coefficients @xmath1 , @xmath2 which extend the symmetry group admitted by equation ( [ eq0 ] ) .",
    "this paper is based on the lie group classification  @xcite ( see also  [ 1 ] ) of the equation ( [ eq0 ] ) with arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this classification contains the result of l  v  ovsyannikov @xcite for equation  ( [ eq0 ] ) with @xmath4 as well as symmetries of the linear case @xmath5 , @xmath4 , which were known by s  lie",
    ".    a few examples of the invariant difference schemes and meshes were considered in  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we complete the paper  [ 2 ] going through all cases of @xmath1 and @xmath2 identified in the group classification  @xcite , we construct difference equations and meshes ( lattices ) which admit the same lie groups of point transformations as their continuous limits .    lie group analysis of difference equations is a very active field of research where many contributions were done , and various approaches were applied by several authors ( see  [ 18 ] ) . in our approach which we are following in this paper we pose the question : how does one discretize a differential equation while preserving all of its lie point symmetries ?",
    "thus a  differential equation and its lie group symmetry are _ a priory _ given but not a difference model .",
    "one then looks for a difference scheme , i.e.  a difference equation and a mesh , that have the same symmetry group and the same lie algebra .",
    "the basic steps in this direction were done [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] , which were summarized in a recent book  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that the invariant difference equations and meshes can be constructed with the help of the entire set of difference invariants of the corresponding lie group . in the next section",
    "we explain how to construct difference models that conserve the whole group of point transformations admitted by the differential equations .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 provides a brief overview of the invariant discretization procedure . in sections  3 , 4 , 5 and  6",
    "we consider the cases of an arbitrary heat transfer coefficient @xmath1 , the exponential heat transfer coefficient @xmath6 , the power heat transfer coefficient @xmath7 and the special case of power heat transfer coefficient : @xmath8 correspondingly .",
    "section  7 is devoted to the linear heat conductivity with a source .",
    "in particular , this section covers detailed study of the invariant difference scheme for the linear heat equation without a source ( @xmath9 ) including such aspects as superposition principle , reduction of the invariant scheme on the optimal system of subalgebras and the way to transform the moving mesh scheme into a stationary one .",
    "notice that in the paper  [ 19 ] there were considered some difference approximations of the linear heat transfer equation , which preserve its different symmetries on different meshes . in",
    "[ 19 ] a difference equation and a  mesh are _ a priori _ given , then it was shown that for some kind of the mesh there were preserved some symmetries of the linear heat equation and another meshes preserve other parts of the symmetries . thus , there are no difference schemes which conserve the _ entire set of symmetries _ in one difference model . in section  7",
    "we will develop the difference mesh and difference equation , which conserve the complete set of original symmetries in the one and the same difference scheme .",
    "the same approach we will apply for some tens of other nonlinear models of heat equation ( [ eq0 ] ) . summarizing conclusions end up the consideration of the entire set of invariant schemes for the equation ( [ eq0 ] ) .",
    "\\1 . let us briefly describe this method , which was called _",
    "the method of finite - difference invariants _  @xcite .",
    "let the differential equation @xmath10 admit a known symmetry group @xmath11 , whose lie algebra is spanned by the operators @xmath12 of the form @xmath13 where the coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , since we consider lie point symmetries .",
    "then we would like to propose a discrete model @xmath20 where the first equation is the approximation of the initial differential equation and the second one defines a difference mesh . both of these equations _ a priori _ are not given and we have to establish the invariant mesh , on which we should approximate the original heat equation .",
    "we will show , that in all special cases of equation  ( [ eq0 ] ) one can construct the system ( [ eqtt ] ) , starting from the entire set of finite - difference invariants of the corresponding lie group .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 in ( [ eqtt ] ) a finite number of difference variables , which are used in the considered _ difference stencil _ ,",
    "i.e.  a finite number of mesh points , which are needed for the approximation of the differential equation ( [ eqet ] ) . the equations ( [ eqtt ] ) can be explicitly connected with each other ( if invariant mesh depends on solution ) or not . in the last case",
    "we can choose the invariant mesh firstly ( for example , a fixed mesh ) and then construct the invariant approximation of the original equation . if a mesh depends on the solution , all specifications of the mesh made in advance lead to restrictions on the symmetries which may be admitted by the considered discrete models .",
    "the idea of the method of finite - difference invariants springs from the invariant representation of differential equations . in the continuous case for the group @xmath11",
    "we can find the complete set of functionally independent differential invariants @xmath22 in the specified space which contains dependent and independent variables as well as the set of derivatives up to the highest derivatives involved in the formulation of the pde  @xcite .",
    "for the heat equation  ( [ eq0 ] ) we consider the space @xmath23 .",
    "we prolong the operator ( [ operator1 ] ) on the variables of the space  @xmath24 @xmath25 with @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the total derivative operators for time and space correspondingly .",
    "differential invariants are solutions of the system of linear equations @xmath29 and can be solved by standard procedure ( see  [ 15 ] ) .",
    "then we represent the invariant differential equation in terms of these invariants @xmath30 the obtained equation is invariant with respect to the group @xmath11 .    \\3 . in the discrete case",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "any given differential equation can be approximated by means of infinitely many difference equations and meshes , which have the original differential equation as its continuous limit .",
    "the requirement of preservation of lie group properties of the differential equation in its discrete counterpart still leaves some freedom in the approximations .",
    "thus , as it can be seen recently , at some point we have to make a chose among the general family of invariant meshes .",
    "the structure of the admitted group essentially effects on construction of equations and meshes .",
    "group transformations can break the geometric structure of the difference mesh that influences approximation and other properties of difference equations .",
    "first steps to the construction of the difference grids geometry based on the symmetries of the initial difference model were done in  [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 ] . there were found classes of transformations that conserve uniformity , orthogonality and other properties of the grids .",
    "it was shown [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 ] that a transformation defined by ( [ operator1 ] ) conserves uniformity of a mesh in @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions if and only if @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote total difference derivatives in the time and space directions with steps  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 correspondingly .",
    "for an orthogonal mesh to be conserved under the transformation , it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath36    when condition ( [ cht ] ) is not satisfied for a given group , the flatness of the layer of a  grid in some direction is rather important . for evolution equations it is significant to have flat time layers .",
    "there is a simple criterion of the invariance of flat time layers under the action of a given operator  ( [ operator1 ] ) : @xmath37 these condition specify invariant geometry of grids for the given lie group symmetries .",
    "if the operator coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 do not depend on solution , then we can choose the invariant mesh as any solution of corresponding condition ( [ ct])([cht2 ] ) . otherwise the conditions ( [ ct])([cht2 ] ) should hold on the solutions of the considered difference model . in that case",
    "we can figure a mesh out starting from the set of difference invariants .",
    "further we choose a stencil which is sufficient to approximate all derivatives which appear in the equation .",
    "we will consider six - point stencils which have three points on each of two time layers .",
    "such stencils allow us to write down both explicit and implicit difference schemes . for different transformation groups we will consider different meshes : orthogonal mesh which is uniform in space , orthogonal mesh which is nonuniform in space and nonorthogonal in time - space mesh , i.e.  moving mesh .",
    "the corresponding stencils are different .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding spaces of discrete variables are of different dimensions so that they have different number of difference invariants @xmath40 for the same lie group  @xmath11 .    for example",
    ", let us take an orthogonal mesh which is uniform in space .",
    "( we will describe later for which groups this mesh can be considered . )",
