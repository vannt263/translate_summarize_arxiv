    "interest in the physics of heavy fermion materials  @xcite has sustained for the past four decades because they display a rich variety of phenomena like lattice kondo effect  @xcite , large electron masses , quantum criticality  @xcite , valence fluctuation driven kondo collapse and unconventional superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena arise mainly due to the presence of an active @xmath6-orbital which forms a very narrow band , and thus leads to strong correlations  @xcite .",
    "the concentration of @xmath6- electrons in heavy fermion alloys can be tuned by substituting non magnetic homologues ; for example lanthanum ( la ) can be substituted for cerium(ce ) .",
    "various examples of such alloys are ce@xmath3la@xmath4cu@xmath5  @xcite , ce@xmath3la@xmath4b@xmath5  @xcite , ce@xmath3la@xmath4cu@xmath7si@xmath7  @xcite , and yb@xmath3lu@xmath4rh@xmath7si@xmath7  @xcite etc .",
    "substitution with non - magnetic homologue , defined as kondo - hole ( kh ) type substitution , leads to a crossover from coherent lattice to incoherent single impurity behaviour .",
    "such a crossover is reflected in dynamics and transport properties .",
    "the other kind of substitution in heavy fermions is ligand field substitution , as in cecu@xmath8au@xmath4  @xcite and ucu@xmath9pd@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this kind of doping in the former leads to a quantum critical point , that in turn manifests in a wide parameter space at finite temperatures and leads to anomalous properties .",
    "experimentally , the changes in physical properties due to kondo - hole type substitution are quite well known . with increasing disorder , the coherence peak in resistivity vanishes while the high temperature single - impurity hammann form is preserved  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the characteristic peak in the thermopower decreases with increasing disorder strength  @xcite . in the extreme dilution limit",
    ", the peak even changes sign  @xcite .",
    "however , these features and their detailed doping dependence is quite material - specific  @xcite .",
    "the hall coefficient , @xmath10 , which is constant ( @xmath11 ) with temperature for normal metals , is highly temperature and concentration dependent for heavy fermion metals .",
    "with increasing concentration of kondo holes , the magnitude of hall coefficient extrapolated to zero temperature ( @xmath12 ) changes sign  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "our main aim is to explore the dynamics and transport quantities across the kondo - hole doping induced crossover from coherent hfs to incoherent single impurity behaviour .",
    "theoretical work on heavy fermions ( hfs ) with kondo hole substitution , modeled by the periodic anderson model ( pam ) , has been extensive .",
    "a standard approach is to embed the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite within the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) framework which yields a dynamical cpa ( dcpa )  @xcite .",
    "the dcpa has been employed in combination with impurity solvers such as slave boson ( sb ) mean field theory  @xcite , numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite and iterative perturbation theory ( ipt )  @xcite to investigate the diluted pam .",
    "we have derived dcpa equations using a feenberg renormalized perturbation series and have employed the local moment approach  @xcite as an impurity solver .",
    "the comprehensive nrg work by grenzebach et al  @xcite focused on resistivity and thermopower in the kondo lattice limit . while our results do concur with ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition , we demonstrate the existence of a universal low energy scale at finite @xmath0 and the dependence of the crossover on @xmath13 in the resistivity .",
    "substitutional effects on optical conductivity , optical scattering rate and hall coefficient have been studied in detail for the first time .",
    "we conclude that quantitative agreement with experimental results necessitates the introduction of _ substitution dependence _ into the model parameters . experimentally measured residual resistivity per unit concentration of magnetic impurities",
    "increases with increasing kondo hole concentration  @xcite .",
    "however , in previously reported theoretical work  @xcite , the residual resistivity peaks at a certain concentration value , and is not monotonic . we have found that including concentration dependence into the orbital energy of itinerant electrons correctly reproduces the known experimental trend in residual resistivity .",
    "the paper is structured as follows ; we first discuss the standard model for heavy fermions , i.e. the periodic anderson model , followed by the formalism of cpa+dmft which is needed to incorporate disorder due to kondo hole substitution . in section  [ subsec : dos_5 ] , we present results for spectral functions , low energy scale and hybridization . in sections  [ subsec : res_5 ] and",
    "[ subsec : therm_5 ] , we discuss resistivity and thermoelectric behaviour . in sections  [",
    "subsec : hall ] , we have discussed the effects of disorder on the hall coefficient and hall angle . in section  [ subsec :",
    "opt_5 ] , we shift to dynamical transport quantities , namely optical conductivity and optical scattering rate . in the final section  [ sec : exp_5 ]",
    ", we have done a detailed comparison of theoretical results with the experimental data for resistivity and thermopower in ce@xmath3la@xmath4b@xmath5 .",
    "the periodic anderson model ( pam ) is the simplest theoretical model to understand the physics of heavy fermions in various regimes . in second quantized notation ,",
    "the pam is expressed as h_pam=-_ij t_ij ( c^_i c^_j + h.c ) + _ i h_ii [ eq5_1 ] where the local part of the hamiltonian is @xmath14 . in this hamiltonian ( equation  [ eq5_1 ] )",
    ", the first term represents kinetic energy of conduction electrons in terms of a hopping amplitude , @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 in the limit of large co - ordination number @xmath17 ) .",
    "we consider the hyper - cubic lattice for which ( @xmath18 ) is the bare c@xmath19 electron density of states .",
    "the second term is diagonal in real space , and represents in sequence , the site energy for conduction electron , localised @xmath6-electrons , hybridization of localised and conduction electrons and the on - site coulomb repulsion between two localised opposite spin electrons respectively .    in order to handle kondo hole substitution and the consequent disorder within dmft  @xcite",
    ", we use the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) which becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we outline our method for incorporating disorder below .",
    "we have employed feenberg renormalized perturbation series ( frps )  @xcite for binary distribution of disorder , i.e. @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 can be any model parameter ) and derived averaged conduction and impurity green s function for pam .",
    "the tight binding hamiltonian which is expressed in second quantized notation as = -_ijt_ijc_i^c_j+_i_c c_i^c_i[eq5_2 ] represents kinetic energy and orbital energy of a non - interacting system . the retarded non - interacting green s function in matrix representation",
    "is given by the following equation , * * g**=[*z+t*]^-1 [ eq5_3 ] where @xmath22 .",
    "the local green s function for the hamiltonian using frps can be written as  @xcite g_ii= [ eq5_4 ] where @xmath23 is a feenberg self - energy and is a functional of local green s functions .",
    "specifically , it is given by the sum of all self - avoiding graphs on the lattice , where the vertices are the local ( site - excluded ) green s functions , while the lines are the hopping amplitudes connecting neighbouring sites  @xcite .",
    "in the limit of infinite - dimensions , the restriction of site - exclusion may be relaxed .",
    "thus , for example , for the bethe lattice , where the only self - avoiding closed paths would be a single - hop to a nearest neighbour , the @xmath24 would be a functional only of the nearest neighbour local ( diagonal ) green s functions .",
    "since @xmath25 is diagonal in the local approximation  @xcite , the green s function in matrix representation is given as * g_())=[*+**t]^-1 [ eq5_6 ] with @xmath26 .",
    "the structure of equations  [ eq5_3 ] and  [ eq5_6 ] is identical and thus the green s function with diagonal self - energy can be written as g_ii;()= [ eq5_7 ] where @xmath23 is exactly the same functional of local interacting green s functions as in the non - interacting case .",
    "so far , we have not invoked any disorder . for a binary alloy , @xmath27 , where every site is surrounded by a fraction @xmath0 of ` @xmath28 ' type sites and @xmath29 of ` @xmath30 ' type .",
    "thus in the feenberg self - energy , since each vertex has a sum over the sites , the argument of the functional becomes a self - averaged quantity .",
    "s_= s and @xmath31 is the disordered averaged cpa green s function and given as g^_()=(1-x)g^_()+xg^ _ ( ) [ eq5_8 ] as discussed in the introduction(section  [ sec : intro_5 ] ) , our focus is on substitutional disorder in @xmath6- sites , and hence we choose @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "equations  [ eq5_13 ] and  [ eq5_14 ] form a self - consistent set of equations for @xmath24 if the self - energies @xmath48 are known . since  @xmath30 \" type for kondo hole substitution does not have  f \" electron , so @xmath49 will have contribution from  @xmath28 \" only and is given by g^_f()=(1-x)^-1 finally , the local green s functions for the @xmath28 type @xmath6- and @xmath34- electrons are given as g^f_()=^-1 [ eq : locgf ] + g^c_()=^-1 [ eq : locgc ] evaluation of local self - energy @xmath50 and the self - consistency of dmft is carried out in the manner discussed in detail in previous works  @xcite for the clean case . for disordered systems , the cpa green s functions are used to evaluate transport properties which have been discussed in the next section . * * * *      since within dmft , vertex corrections are absent  @xcite , the single - particle green s functions are sufficient within the kubo formalism to obtain transport quantities such as dc resistivity and optical conductivity .",
    "the expressions have been derived previously  @xcite for non - disordered case for a hypercubic lattice . with the inclusion of disorder at cpa level ,",
    "the expressions retain the same form , but the c@xmath19 green s function is replaced by the cpa green s function . thus the expression for the real part of optical conductivity is @xmath51 where @xmath52 for a lattice constant @xmath53 , electronic charge @xmath54 , and electron density @xmath55 and @xmath56 . by carrying out a kramers - kronig transform @xmath57 of the @xmath58 we can get @xmath59 , and then the complex optical conductivity , @xmath60 , can be obtained as @xmath61 .",
    "the optical scattering rate is defined as  @xcite @xmath62 .    the dc conductivity",

    "@xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our main objective in this work is to elucidate the emergence of incoherence in heavy fermions through the introduction of kondo holes",
    ". the focal theme throughout this section will be the crossover from coherent lattice behaviour to incoherent single - impurity behaviour as a function of the concentration of kondo holes .",
    "the manifestation of this crossover will be examined in single - particle quantities such as spectral functions , and two - particle quantities such as dc conductivity , optical conductivity , optical scattering rate , thermopower and hall coefficient .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that heavy fermions systems display such a crossover even in the clean limit with an increase in temperature from @xmath69 to beyond the lattice coherence temperature .",
    "we will examine the interplay of disorder and temperature in inducing the incoherence .",
    "the conduction band centre is fixed at @xmath70 .",
    "we begin with single - particle dynamics , i.e , with the density of states and low energy scale .",
    "next , we explore two particle static quantities and finally , we will discuss two - particle dynamical quantities .",
    "the clean limit of the pam has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "it has been found  @xcite that the spectral functions , optical conductivity and resistivity in the strong coupling regime are universal functions of @xmath71 .",
    "the low energy scale , which is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an exponentially decreasing function  @xcite of @xmath74 ( for @xmath75 ) . substituting @xmath6-electrons with kondo holes should give rise to significant changes in the local @xmath6-electron spectrum and the low energy kondo scale .",
    "in a recent work  @xcite , we have shown that the cpa self - energy develops a finite linear in frequency imaginary part , thus a definition of quasiparticle - weight using the cpa self - energy is not possible . however , the local self - energy does have adiabatic continuity to the non - interacting limit , and hence may be used to define a low energy scale , which would naturally depend on the kondo hole concentration , @xmath0 .",
    "we define a low energy scale , @xmath76 as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the quasiparticle weight of the local self - energy for a given @xmath0 . for kondo hole",
    "substituted systems in the strong coupling limit , the low energy scale @xmath76 is exponentially small , which is a prerequisite for the scaling consideration of spectral quantities . in figure",
    "[ fig : unv1 ] , we have shown @xmath76 , which is indeed exponentially decreasing with increasing coulomb interaction @xmath79 for different concentrations .",
    "further , in figure  [ fig : unv ] , we show the universal behaviour of the local f@xmath19 spectral function @xmath80 for different substitution values .    in the panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : unv ]",
    ", we show the local f@xmath19 spectral functions _ vs _ scaled frequency @xmath81 for different coulomb interactions @xmath82 ( solid line ) , @xmath83 ( dotted line ) , @xmath84 ( dashed line ) for substitution value @xmath85 . the f@xmath19 spectral functions for different @xmath79 collapse onto a universal form . similarly in panels ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) the scaling of f@xmath19 spectral functions have been shown for the @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "such universal behaviour of the local f@xmath19 spectral functions for a wide range of substitution values concludes the presence of a low energy scale for kondo hole substituted heavy fermions .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that such universal scaling is not obtained for the disorder averaged , i.e the cpa green s functions .",
    "this naturally implies that transport or other quantities , that depend on the cpa green s functions will not exhibit a scaling collapse as a function of varying interaction strength .    the hybridization function , @xmath89 $ ] , ( where the @xmath24 is the feenberg self - energy ) depends , naturally , on kondo hole concentration .",
    "this @xmath90 may be found through the imaginary part of the inverse of the host green s function , which is determined self - consistently within dmft  @xcite .",
    "we show the @xmath90 in figure  [ fig : dos_5 ] .",
    "it is seen that for small values of concentrations , the hybridization function has a gaussian envelope with spectral weight carved around @xmath91 . with increasing concentration",
    ", the hybridization gap fills up and in the single impurity limit , ( @xmath92 ) we see a featureless gaussian .",
    "this is expected , because in the dilute limit , the impurities should have a negligible effect on the host , hence the hybridization assumes a simple form that is proportional to the non - interacting density of states , which has been chosen to be a gaussian in our work .",
    "one important inference can be made here about the difference between the influence of kondo hole disorder _ vs. _ temperature .",
    "the spectral weight transfer into the hybridization gap is seen to arise from high energy scales , even from the hubbard bands ( figure  [ fig : dos_5 ] ) .",
    "thus , disorder is seen to affect all energy scales .",
    "temperature , in contrast , affects the spectrum only on energy scales that are comparable to the thermal energy scale  @xcite .",
    "hence the incoherence effects induced by disorder are quite distinct to those by temperature .    in the figure  [ fig : wl_5 ]",
    ", we show the low frequency region of the local @xmath6-dos , @xmath93 , ( equation  [ eq : locgf ] ) as a function of ` bare ' frequency , @xmath94 for various values of the kondo hole concentration , @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that a redistribution of spectral weight has occurred with the increase in @xmath0 , and the hybridization gap flanking the kondo resonance fills up giving rise to a broad resonance in the single - impurity limit .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum of the resonance is expected to be proportional to the low energy scale . and given the broadening of the resonance , we must expect that the @xmath95 should increase with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , as the inset shows , the @xmath95 rises almost linearly , and saturates in the single - impurity limit .",
    "next , we will discuss the effect of disorder on finite temperature static response functions i.e resistivity , thermopower , hall coefficient and hall angle .",
    "in the main panel of figure  [ fig : dcres_5 ] , the effects of kondo hole substitution on dc resistivity @xmath96 _ _ v__s scaled temperature @xmath97 , where @xmath95 is the low energy scale for @xmath98 , have been shown . for zero concentration ,",
    "resistivity is zero at @xmath69 and follows @xmath99 behavior ( fermi - liquid ) at low temperatures .",
    "as temperature is increased , a crossover from coherent to incoherent behavior in resistivity take place . at high temperatures ( @xmath100 )",
    ", the resistivity shows the asymptotic single impurity hamann form ( @xmath101 ) as discussed in detail in previous work  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a coherence peak signifies the crossover at low temperatures to coherent lattice behaviour .",
    "coherence peak shifts to lower temperature value with increasing kondo hole concentration .",
    "since the resistivity decreases monotonically with increasing temperature for @xmath102 , lattice coherent behaviour never sets in for the higher concentration values . at @xmath103 , the resistivity for all @xmath0 collapses onto a single universal form , which is simply the resistivity for a single - impurity anderson model ( see inset of figure  [ fig : dcres_5 ]  @xcite ) .",
    "the residual resistivity ( not shown ) does not follow nordheim s rule ( @xmath104 ) , which is consistent with previous work  @xcite and experiments  @xcite .    in a few recent works ,",
    "the authors  @xcite used cpa combined with slave - boson mean field , to show that a ` critical ' concentration of @xmath105 is required to induce a crossover from lattice coherent behaviour to single impurity incoherent behaviour .",
    "this implies that the crossover to incoherence is dependent on the conduction electron concentration . for symmetric kondo insulators , since the @xmath106",
    ", this crossover would occur for an infinitesimal concentration of kondo holes , while in the exhaustion regime  @xcite , the crossover would require a high substitution of the non - magnetic homologue .",
    "we investigate this conduction electron dependence in the crossover through a study of the coherence peak in the resistivity shown in figure  [ fig : crossover ] .    in top panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : crossover ]",
    ", we show the dc resistivity for @xmath107 .",
    "the coherence peak is present upto @xmath108 and resistivity follows single impurity behaviour beyond .",
    "similarly in middle panel(b ) and bottom panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : crossover ] , crossover from lattice coherent to single impurity incoherent behaviour takes place at @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with the finding in ref @xmath113 , mentioned in the above paragraph .",
    "the effect of kondo hole substitution on thermopower for different temperatures has been shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : dctherm_5 ] . like resistivity",
    ", temperature has been scaled by low energy scale of @xmath98 . in the clean case ,",
    "the thermopower rises from zero , reaches a maximum at a universal temperature , @xmath114 , and subsequently decreases monotonically , with a change of sign at non - universal temperatures .",
    "this functional form is preserved for almost all @xmath0 , with a distinct form arising only in the extreme dilution limit ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "however , the position of the ` coherence peak ' exhibits an interesting feature with varying @xmath0 , that is related to the ` critical ' @xmath0 at which the crossover from coherent lattice to single impurity incoherent behaviour occurs in the resistivity . for @xmath116 , the position of the maximum in thermopower red shifts",
    "monotonically with increasing concentration of kondo holes , and for higher @xmath0 , begins to blue shift ( upper panel of figure  [ fig : dctherm_5 ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of this peak however decreases monotonically with increase in @xmath0 and changes sign in the single - impurity limit . in the extreme dilution limit shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : dctherm_5 ] ,",
    "the thermopower looks qualitatively similar to that of siam  @xcite ( inset of lower panel ) , i.e. one peak at low temperature and the other peak with opposite sign at large temperature .",
    "the hall coefficient , @xmath10 , in conventional metals is temperature independent , and a simple measure of the carrier type and density .",
    "heavy fermion metals , on the other hand , exhibit a highly temperature dependent and material specific hall coefficient @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "various theoretical explanations for anomalous hall effect have been discussed in detail in the recent review by s. nair _ et .",
    "al _  @xcite . in the figure  [",
    "fig : hall ] , we show the hall coefficient ( scaled by the @xmath10 at @xmath69 of the single impurity ) _ vs. _ scaled temperature ( @xmath97 ) , where @xmath95 is low energy scale for zero kondo hole concentration , for various values of the kondo hole concentration , @xmath0 . in the clean kondo lattice limit ( @xmath1 ) , the hall coefficient has a finite positive value , which increases with increase in temperature , peaks around @xmath117 and then decreases monotonically with a change of sign at higher non - universal temperatures . at zero temperature ,",
    "the @xmath10 decreases in magnitude and eventually as @xmath118 , changes sign with increasing @xmath0 . in parallel to the behaviour in resistivity , a collapse of @xmath10 _ vs. _ @xmath119 is found at higher temperatures ( @xmath120 ) for all @xmath0 reflecting a crossover from lattice coherent behaviour to single - impurity behaviour , as a function of @xmath119 and @xmath0 .",
    "since we have computed the resistivity and the hall coefficient , it is straightforward to explore the hall angle , which is defined as @xmath121 , as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath119 . since the @xmath10 changes sign with increasing @xmath119 for @xmath122 , we expect , in this range of @xmath0 , the hall angle to show sign change with increase in temperature .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hallangle ] , the variation of hall angle with temperature has been shown for different concentrations of kondo holes . in the concentrated limit ( below @xmath123 ) , hall angle has finite positive value at low temperature and changes sign sharply at large non - universal temperatures .",
    "the sign change occurs only for @xmath124 and beyond that , the sign of hall angle does not change .",
    "an important fact to be noticed here is that the sign change in hall angle occurs almost like a first order transition , which is in complete contrast to the smooth crossover seen in resistivity and hall coefficient , which are numerator and denominator respectively of the hall angle ( @xmath121 ) .    in the next subsection ,",
    "we discuss the effects of kondo hole substitution on dynamical response functions . we consider optics first .      in the left panel of figure  [ fig : opt_5 ]",
    ", we show the @xmath69 optical conductivity computed using equation  [ eq5_18 ] for different values of @xmath0 . with increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the drude peak at @xmath125 melts rapidly and the low frequency region appears flat and featureless .",
    "the dc value of the optical conductivity represents static effects of impurity scattering .",
    "the mid - infrared peak moves to lower frequencies with increase in kondo hole concentration .",
    "this is counter - intuitive if we invoke the renormalized non - interacting picture , which says that the mir peak is positioned at @xmath126",
    ". the scale increases with @xmath0 , so if the mir were to be proportional to @xmath127 , then the mir would experience a blue shift .",
    "so how does one explain the red shift ?",
    "the answer is provided by the dispersion , @xmath128 found by locus of zeroes of the @xmath129 $ ] .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_5 ] .",
    "it is seen that for low concentration , there is a clean minimum direct gap , that is indeed proportional to @xmath127 . with increasing kondo hole concentration",
    ", the direct gap fills up with mid - gap states , which causes the gap to direct excitation to decrease .",
    "eventually , for @xmath130 , there is almost no gap .",
    "thus , the theory predicts that with increasing substitutional disorder , the mir absorption peak should experience a strong red shift .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy represents the damping of the quasiparticles , and the band structure shown in figure  [ fig : opt_5 ] does not fully capture this aspect , since only the real part of the denominator of the cpa green s function is used . to remedy this ,",
    "we also show the full band structure by plotting @xmath131 and frequency dependent @xmath132 as a two dimensional contour plot ( with false colours ) in figure  [ fig : optics1 ] for four @xmath0 values .",
    "we observe that , at @xmath133 , there is almost no spectral weight in the region between the two bands , implying that the mir peak would be a prominent high energy feature . with increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the two bands come closer and appreciable spectral weight appears in the form of mid - gap states arising due to kondo holes .",
    "this indeed implies that the mir peak will redshift and simultaneously , the absorption will be finite all the way from the peak down to @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the incoherent scattering by random kondo hole substitution is responsible for the red - shift of the mir peak and the concomitant destruction of the drude peak .    the optical scattering rate , @xmath134 , defined in section  [ sec : model_5 ] as @xmath135 ,",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : optscat_5 ] . in the concentrated regime ( @xmath1 ) , a characteristic peak is visible in the optical scattering rate at low frequencies .",
    "this is also observed in experiments  @xcite on heavy fermion systems .",
    "this peak is narrow and centred at @xmath95 for small @xmath0 . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", the peak broadens , experiences a red shift , and ultimately vanishes in the dilute limit .",
    "it is precisely around @xmath136 , that this peak structure vanishes , which is attributed to crossover from heavy fermion to single impurity regime .",
    "the high frequency tail is seen to be universal for all @xmath0 .",
    "we further investigate the effect of temperature on the optical scattering rate for finite value of kondo hole concentration and temperature .    in the main panel of figure  [ fig : optscattemp_5 ] ,",
    "the optical scattering rate has been shown for @xmath137 versus scaled frequency @xmath138 .",
    "the peak in optical scattering rate corrodes slowly with increasing temperature , and finally vanishes for @xmath139 for the parameters mentioned in fig .",
    "[ fig : optscattemp_5 ] . in the inset of figure  [",
    "fig : optscattemp_5 ] , the dc resistivity _ vs. _ temperature has been shown for the same parameter regime .",
    "it is seen that the coherence peak appears at the same value of temperature i.e @xmath140 , where peak in scattering rate vanishes ( main panel ) and for all higher temperatures , the resistivity follows single impurity behaviour .",
    "thus , the behaviour of optical scattering rate is consistent with resistivity in terms of predicting the crossover from kondo lattice ( kl ) to single impurity .",
    "in previous work  @xcite , dmft+lma has been employed to compare theory with experiments for a few heavy fermion metals in the clean case .",
    "theoretical comparisons with experiment for disordered case has several complications .",
    "substitutional disorder may change lattice constants which effectively can change the hopping parameters , site energies and hybridization amplitudes .",
    "a precise estimation of model parameters for different values of concentration is next to impossible and thus only qualitative comparison is possible . in figure",
    "[ fig : expres_5 ] , we have compared concentration dependent resistivity of ce@xmath4la@xmath3b@xmath5 by n. sato _ et al _  @xcite with our theory .",
    "in the top panel , we present theoretical data where @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the bottom panel reproduces the ( phonon subtracted ) experimental data of sato  @xcite . with the above choice of parameters and appropriate scaling ( mentioned in previous work  @xcite ) ,",
    "the theoretical data matches excellently with experimental data ( right panel of figure  [ fig : expres_5 ] ) for the clean case ( @xmath98 ) . if we compute resistivities for finite @xmath0 without changing the model parameters , we find that the residual resistivity peaks at a finite @xmath0 , which contradicts the experimental observation that the residual resistivity increases monotonically with increasing @xmath0 and saturates in the dilute limit . hence , in order to get correct trend in residual resistivity with increasing disorder , we introduce a minimal dependence of a single model parameter with @xmath0 .",
    "our choice is the linear dependence of @xmath0 for the conduction orbital site energy ( @xmath144 , with @xmath145 ) which effectively determines the hybridization ( @xmath146 ) of f@xmath19 electrons with the conduction bath .",
    "the argument behind such a choice is that the larger atomic size of the doped lanthanum atom changes the effective hybridization .",
    "the argument is consistent with experimentally found increase in lattice constant upon ce substitution with la  @xcite .",
    "further , the @xmath0-axis is scaled by ratio of coherence peak position in theory to the experiment for zero disorder .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is seen to be qualitatively good .      in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : exptherm_5 ] ,",
    "thermopower measurement by kim  @xcite of ce@xmath4la@xmath3b@xmath5 for varying concentrations of cerium is shown ( note that the @xmath0 used in experiment is @xmath29 in our theory ) .",
    "the experimentally measured thermopower includes electronic ( @xmath6 ) and lattice contributions .",
    "it is important to extract the electronic contribution in thermopower coefficient , since our calculation does not include phonons . for the case of dc resistivity ,",
    "the mattheissen s rule was employed to extract the electronic contribution . for thermopower ,",
    "the nordheim - gorter rule @xmath147 is commonly employed .",
    "the contribution from the first term is small and can be neglected ( as argued in experimental work  @xcite ) , thus @xmath148 .",
    "it is observed that the peak position in thermopower shifts to lower temperatures with increasing @xmath0 . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : exptherm_5 ] ,",
    "the theoretically computed thermopower is shown for the same parameter values as in figure  [ fig : expres_5 ] .",
    "the @xmath0-axis of theoretical data has been scaled uniformaly for all @xmath0 by the ratio of the peak position in thermopower in theory to experiment for @xmath98 .",
    "the theory does agree reasonably with experiments . indeed it is gratifying to note that the theoretically computed dc resistivity and thermopower agree with experiments on la substituted ceb@xmath5 for the same set of parameters .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated kondo hole type of substitution in heavy fermions using coherent potential approximation combined with dynamical mean field theory and local moment approach .",
    "the physics issue in focus is the crossover from heavy fermions to single impurity behaviour in physical properties like resistivity and thermopower .",
    "the approach used here does capture the crossover from kondo lattice to single impurity behaviour as reflected in spectral functions , optics , resistivity , thermopower , hall coefficient and optical scattering rate .",
    "the coherence peak in resistivity which is inherent to heavy fermion systems vanishes beyond a certain value of kondo hole concentration .",
    "this value of concentration is dependent on conduction electron ( @xmath13 ) filling . in the dilute limit",
    ", there is a sign change in thermopower .",
    "the zero temperature hall coefficient and hall angle also change sign at @xmath2 . in the optical conductivity ,",
    "drude peak vanishes beyond the @xmath2 .",
    "the peak structure in optical scattering rate and coherence peak in resistivity has one to one correspondence and are the measure of the coherence in the system .",
    "comparison of our theoretical results with experimental data for resistivity and thermopower yields qualitatively good agreement .",
    "a concentration dependent conduction orbital energy correctly captures the experimental trend in resistivity and thermopower .",
    "coherent potential approximation does not capture inter - site coherence and coherent back scattering effects . recently developed approaches such as the typical medium - dynamical cluster approximation should be able to capture such effects and will be the subject of future investigation .",
