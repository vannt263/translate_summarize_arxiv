    "a problem of an explosion mechanism for type ii supernovae remains unresolved , although this phenomenon is undoubtedly related with the gravitational collapse of an iron core . in this regard of great importance",
    "are the observational manifestations of the explosion that might hint the ways of the problem solution and to play a role of observational tests of models .",
    "one of the specific properties of the explosion mechanism is the asymmetry ( ardeljan et al .",
    "2005 ; blinnikov et al . 1990 ; herant et al .",
    "1992 ; scheck et al .",
    "2004 ; burrows et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it can manifest itself both in the asymmetry of the emission line profiles and in the polarization of radiation .",
    "asymmetry effects were observed for the first time in the anomalous type iip supernova sn  1987a ( for h@xmath1 asymmetry see phillips and williams [ 1991 ] and for the polarization see jeffery [ 1991 ] ) .",
    "both effects have been interpreted in a model of asymmetric @xmath0ni ejecta embedded in the symmetric envelope ( chugai 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "the line asymmetry was observed also in the normal type iip supernova sn  1999em ( elmhamdi et al .",
    "interestingly , in both supernovae the asymmetry was characterized by the redshift which indicated that the @xmath0ni was ejected predominantly toward the far hemisphere .    a standard type iip supernova sn  2004dj ( nakano et al .",
    "2004 ) generated a great interest because of its proximity ( d=3.13 mpc ) .",
    "however , more important is that its nebular spectra revealed a strong line asymmetry , particularly of the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the asymmetry manifested itself as a pronounced blueshift of emission line maximuma by about 1500 km s@xmath2 ( chugai et al . 2005 ) .",
    "modeling the h@xmath1 in that paper led us to conclude that @xmath0ni is distributed as bipolar asymmetric ejecta with a more masive jet residing in the near hemisphere .",
    "the recovery of the @xmath0ni distribution upon the basis of the profile modeling is , strickly speaking , ill - posed problem , so doubts may arise whether this procedure is unambiguous . an independent confirmation is therefore needed .",
    "recently leonard et al . ( 2006 ) reported results of the polarimetric observations of sn  2004dj in which the intrinsic variable polarization in the band of @xmath3   was detected with maximum value of 0.56% at the end of the light curve plateau . according to authors",
    "suggestion the polarization in sn  2004dj arises because of the thomson scattering , while the evolution of the polarization is interpreted as a result of the decrease of the thomson optical depth of the supernovae with spherical envelope and asymmetric core .",
    "it is shown , simultaneously , that the change of position angle of the polarization contradicts to the model of axialy symmetric bipolar @xmath0ni ejecta .",
    "a question arises whether the asymmetry of the @xmath0ni distribution responsible for the h@xmath1 profile asymmetry of the sn  2004dj is able also to account for the polarization at least at the nebular epoch ?",
    "the present paper is concentrated on the answer to this important question . in second section",
    "i describe the model used to compute the electron density distribution caused by the asymmetric @xmath0ni distribution .",
    "the third section presents results of the modelling of h@xmath1 line and of the polarization produced by the thomson scattering of continuum photons in the asymmetric electron distribution .",
    "i adopt 2004 june 28 to be the explosion date in contrast to june 13 adopted in the previous paper .",
    "the revision is dictated by two arguments .",
    "first , plateau length of sn  1999gi , which was used as a template for sn  2004dj , is maximum ( @xmath4 d ) among type iip supernovae , while the average duration is @xmath5 d. second , from the spectral evolution of sn  2004dj patat et al .",
    "( 2004 ) estimate the explosion date to be about july 14 . adopting the plateau duration to be 110 d we come to a compromise explosion date of june 28 , which is two days earlier than the explosion date estimated by vinko et al .",
    "( 2006 ) from the analysis of the photosphere evolution .",
    "the calculation of the intrinsic polarization of sn  2004dj at the nebular epoch is reduced to the calculation of ( a ) the deposition of the gamma - rays of @xmath0co@xmath0fe decay ; ( b ) ionization balance of the hydrogen for the adopted spherical density distribution and asymmetric @xmath0ni distribution ; ( c ) transfer of the polarized radiation on the background of the asymmetric distribution of the electron density .",
    "the optimal parameter choice of the @xmath0ni distribution is determined from the description of the h@xmath1 profile and luminosity .",
    "it should be emphasised that unlike the previous model , in which the h@xmath1 emissivity was assumed to be proportional to the deposition , here i calculate the hydrogen ionization and h@xmath1 emissivity in more detailes .    the adopted model of the sn  2004dj envelope and @xmath0ni distribution , repeats , with minor exceptions , the model used previously for the h@xmath1 profile calculation ( chugai et al .",
    "specifically , the @xmath0ni distribution is represented by the central component and bipolar jets .",
    "note , here the central @xmath0ni component is a complete sphere ( fig .",
    "1 ) , not cut sphere as previously assumed ( chugai et al .",
    "the envelope expands homologously , i.e. , the velocity , radius and age obey the relation @xmath6 .",
    "the envelope is spherically - symmetric ( with the exception of @xmath0ni ) and the density - velocity dependence is exponential @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are determined by the kinetic energy @xmath10 and mass @xmath11 .",
    "the exponential law qualitatively reproduces the density distribution of hydrodynamical models in the relevant velocity range @xmath12 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the hydrogen abundance in the envelope is @xmath13 . in the central zone @xmath14 , which presumably coincides with the spherical @xmath0ni component , the hydrogen resides , presumably , in condensations with @xmath13 and the volume filling factor @xmath15 .",
    "note , in the previous paper the parameter @xmath16 was absent ; instead it was assumed that @xmath16 linearly increased between zero and unity in the velocity range @xmath17 . following the previus paper",
    "i assume here that @xmath0ni condensations are imbedded in the hydrogen - free cocoons with the total mass @xmath18 .",
    "the justification and details of the model of the @xmath0ni distribution along with the method of the calculation of the gamma - ray deposition are given in the previous paper ( chugai et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the hydrogen ionization is calculated from equations of the ionization balance for two - level hydrogen atom with the continuum . in this approximation",
    "we are able to take into account major processes of the nonthermal ionization and excitation along with the photoionization due to the absorption of the two - photon and recombination balmer continuum radiation from the second level ( chugai 1987 ; xu et al .",
    "the radiation transfer in the balmer continuum is treated using a local approximation .",
    "the absorption probability of the recombination balmer continuum is set to be @xmath19 .",
    "here @xmath20 is the local optical depth parameter @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the photoionization cross - section at the threshold , @xmath23 is the population at the second level , @xmath9 is the velocity scale of the exponential density distribution .",
    "the absorption probability of the two - photon radiation is approximately @xmath24 given the frequency dependence of the cross - section ( @xmath25 ) and the weak frequency dependence of the two - photon spectrum .",
    "the total rate of the hydrogen nonthermal ionization and excitation is @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( erg @xmath28 s@xmath2 ) is the energy deposition rate , @xmath29 is the hydrogen ionization potential , @xmath30 is the energy fraction spent on the coulomb heating , which , using calculations by kozma snd fransson ( 1992 ) , can be approximated as @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the hydrogen ionization fraction ) .",
    "strickly speaking , one needs to take into account that the deposition is shared between hydrogen and helium .",
    "however , since the ultraviolet photons emitted by helium owing to the nonthermal ionization and excitation efficiently ionize hydrogen , the omission of the nonthermal ionization of he does not markedly change the rate of hydrogen ionization and excitation compared with the approximation ( [ eq : gdef ] ) .",
    "i assume following xu et al .",
    "( 1992 ) that the energy spent on the nonthermal hydrogen ionization and excitation is shared between the ionization with the branching ratio @xmath33 , second level excitation ( @xmath34 ) and third level excitation ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "collisions with thermal electron are also taken into account . since a thermal balance",
    "is not calculated i adopt the constant electron temperature @xmath36  k. the model with @xmath37  k produces only 5% lower emission measure , i.e. , @xmath38% lower electron concentration .",
    "this demonstrates a weak sensitivity to the electron temperature in the region of reasonable values of this paprameter .",
    "balance equations for the ionization and second level population with principal processes taken into account read @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the photoionization rate for the second level , @xmath42 is the recombination coefficient for excited levels @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the electron concentration , @xmath45 s@xmath2 is the probability of the two - photon transition 21 ( i assume the equipartition between @xmath46 and @xmath47 levels ) , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the collisional excitation coefficients , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are collisional ionization coefficients , @xmath52 is the spontaneous transition rate , @xmath53 is the sobolev escape probability fot the l@xmath1 photon . in equation ( [ eq : g2 ] )",
    "i adopt that the nonthermal excitation of the third level ( second term in the right hand side ) results in the excitation of the second level .",
    "the photoionization rate is determined by the absorption of the two - photon and recombination balmer continuum radiation : @xmath54 the factor 1.42 takes into account the fraction ( 0.71 ) of the two - photon radiation with energy @xmath55 ev and that two photons are emitted simultaneously .",
    "optimal parameters of the @xmath0ni distribution are choosen via modelling the h@xmath1 profile and its evolution .",
    "the h@xmath1 emissivity is calculated using the balance equation for the third level that includes the major processes : recombinations to levels @xmath56 , nonthermal excitation of the third level by fast electrons and de - excitation by thermal electron collisions .",
    "the net rate of the h@xmath1 emission ( erg @xmath28 s@xmath2 ) is then @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the recombination coefficient to levels @xmath56 .",
    "the above equations of ionization and level populations balance are solved for the envelope with the kinetic energy of @xmath59 erg that is characteristic of sn  1987a ( utrobin 2005 ) and ejecta mass @xmath60 .",
    "the adopted @xmath0ni mass is @xmath61 ( chugai et al .",
    "our computations show a weak dependence on the energy .",
    "the model with lower energy , @xmath62 erg being characteristic of sn  1999em ( baklanov et al . 2005 ) predicts practically the same h@xmath1 profile and the very small difference in the h@xmath1 absolute luminosity behavior .",
    "the transfer of the polarized radiation of the quasi - continuum in the @xmath63    band is modelled by monte carlo technique ( angel 1969 ) .",
    "i consider only thomson scattering of photons .",
    "the direction and polarization of the scattered photon is diced according to the dipole scattering law .",
    "stokes vector components @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 of escaping photons are summed in the corresponding polar angle bin .",
    "the number of photons in a typical simulation is @xmath67 .",
    "the code was tested using available analytical results .",
    "in particular , the model reproduces the chandrasekhar - sobolev limit ( @xmath68% ) in the problem of the polarization for the thomson scattering in the plane atmosphere .",
    "calculations of the h@xmath1 profile and polarization were performed for the models with the inclination angle of the @xmath0ni ejecta @xmath69 ( model m1 ) , likewise in the previous model ( chugai et al .",
    "2005 ) , and @xmath70 ( model m2 ) .",
    "parameters of the @xmath0ni distribution for all the models , including previous model m0 ( chugai et al . 2005 ) , are given in table 1 .",
    "starting with the third column the table presents the expansion velocity of the central component , boundary velocities of jets in the near and far hemisphere , mass of the central @xmath0ni component , masses of both @xmath0ni jets , total mass of cocoons , and the volume filling factor @xmath16 of the hydrogen in the central zone ( in the model m0 this parameter is absent ) .",
    "parameters of the model m1 are a bit different from those of the model m0 because the model m1 has a different geometry of the central component , the model m1 takes into account the filling factor , and the model describes sources of h@xmath1 photons in greater details .",
    "both m1 and m2 models sensibly reproduce the observed h@xmath1 luminosity ( fig .",
    "2 ) . this provides a confidence that the model includes essential processes of the hydrogen ionization and excitation in the envelope .",
    "additional support for the model comes from a close similarity between calculated and observed h@xmath1 profiles for different moments ( fig .",
    "3 ) . this confirms the major result of the previous simulations performed in the frame of a more simple model m0 .",
    "one should emphasise , however , that the absolute correspondence between model and observed profile is lacking .",
    "this indicates that the real supernova has , probably , more complicated structure than our model .",
    "the polarization caused by the thomson scattering is computed using the distribution of the electron concentration found from the modelling of the h@xmath1 profile .",
    "isodensity lines for the electron concentration in the model m1 on days 116 and 315 are shown in fig .",
    "the hourglass structure on day 116 is due to the small ( compared with radius ) free path length of gamma - quanta in the inner region and large path length in the outer layers . with time",
    "the @xmath44 distribution gets more spherical because of the increase of the free path length of gamma - quanta . to compute the polarization we must also set the distribution of the photon sources .",
    "i follow a reasonable assumption that the emissivity of the quasicontinuum is proportional to the deposition rate @xmath27 .    the polarization in model m1 and m2 on days 116 and 222 is shown in fig . 5 as a function of cosine of the polar angle @xmath71 measured from the axis of the rotational symmetry .",
    "both models result in the similar polarization for the same angles .",
    "however , for specific inclination angles of the models , i.e. , @xmath69 for m1 and @xmath70 for m2 , the polarization in the model m2 is significantly ( 1.52 times ) larger than in the model m1 . the polarization decline with time reflects both the decrease of the thomson optical depth and spherization of the distribution of the electron concentration .",
    "note , the position angle of the polarization vector in our model is perpendicular to the axis of the rotational symmetry .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the polarization in the model m1ni ( fig .",
    "5 ) which differ from the model m1 by the larger @xmath0ni mass ( @xmath72 versus @xmath61 ) .",
    "the @xmath0ni mass in the model m1ni is equal to that found in sn  1987a .",
    "this calculation demonstrates the polarization for a hypothetical sn  iip with the @xmath0ni mass to be characteristic of sn  1987a and @xmath0ni asymmetry to be characteristic of sn  2004dj .",
    "interestingly , the polarization for the inclination angle @xmath73 in the model m1ni is only by a factor of 1.44 larger than in the model m1 .",
    "this means that the dependence of the polarization on the @xmath0ni mass is somewhat weaker than square root of the mass .",
    "the latter is expected in a naive model with the recombination rate to be proportional to the deposition rate .",
    "let us compare the computed polarization in the model m1ni with the observed polarization of sn  1987a at the nebular epoch . around day 200",
    "the intrinsic polarization of sn  1987a in @xmath74 band ( where effect of line scattering is small ) is about @xmath75% ( cf .",
    "jeffery 1991 ) . according to the model m1ni this value corresponds to the inclination angle of the bipolar ejecta @xmath76 .",
    "this estimate should be regarded , of course , as illustrative .",
    "yet , it is amazing that the value coincides within errors with the inclination of the bipolar ejecta of sn  1987a @xmath77 estimated from different arguments ( wang et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "i return now to the polarization evolution in sn  2004dj .",
    "the calculated polarization in models m1 and m2 taking into account their inclination angles ( table 1 ) is shown in fig . 6 together with the observed polarization for sn  2004dj reported by leonard et al .",
    "the model m2 predicts too large polarization compared to observations and thus should be discarded .",
    "the polarization in the model m1 reproduces the observed value on day 144 .",
    "however , the later decline of the model polarization is slower compared to the observed polarization .",
    "this mismatch possibly stems from the model drawback responsible for poor description of the central part of the h@xmath1 profile on days 222 and 315 ( fig .",
    "our model probably is not quite adequate in the description of the central zone structure , where deviations from the bipolar structure are conceivable .",
    "another drawback of the model is somewhat lower polarization around day 110 compared to observational value ( fig .",
    "the inconsistency of the model at this epoch is , however , unavoidable by , at least , two reasons .",
    "first , on day 107 the supernova is still at the photospheric stage , although at the very end of it . at this epoch",
    "the thermal ionization is dominant , which makes our model unapplicable .",
    "the role of the thermal ionization at that time is illustrated by fig . 7 which shows the h@xmath1 line on days 107 ( leonard et al .",
    "2006 ) , 112 , and 116 ( chugai et al . 2005 ) . on day 116 , as we saw above ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the h@xmath1 line is well described by the model of the nonthermal ionization caused by the asymmetric bipolar @xmath0ni ejecta .",
    "a bit earlier , on day 112 , the profile shows symmetric component related with the residual thermal ionization . on day 107",
    "the symmetric component related with the thermal ionization is dominant ( fig .",
    "our model thus is not applicable for the description of the polarization at this stage .",
    "the second reason , why the model is not valid on day 107 , is even more crucial . according to polarization data ( leonard et al .",
    "2006 ) the position angle ( pa ) of the polarization vector is @xmath78 , whereas for the next observation momemt ( 144 d ) and later on pa@xmath79 . between days 107 and 144 ,",
    "thus , pa rapidly changes by @xmath80 .",
    "the persistence of pa at the nebular epoch is consistent with the model of the axisymmetric bipolar @xmath0ni ejecta , while the observed change of pa at the early epoch , on the contrary , disagrees with this model .",
    "generally , the transition from optically thick to optically thin scattering regime may cause a jump of pa of the polarization vector by @xmath81 ( angel 1969 ) .",
    "this phenomenon , obviously , has nothing to do with the observed pa jump by @xmath80 .",
    "the behavior of pa between days 104 and 144 indicates , therefore , that some additional transient component of polarized radiation dominates around day 107 and this component is not related to axisymmetric @xmath0ni ejecta ( leonard et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the early polarization component may be dubbed for clarity `` photospheric '' in contrast to the `` nebular '' at the epochs @xmath82 d.    in the range of the applicability of the axysymmetric model ( @xmath82 d ) one may claim that the model of the bipolar @xmath0ni ejecta with the inclination angle @xmath69 that describes the h@xmath1 profile also reproduces the observed polarization at the early nebular epoch ( @xmath83 d ) and is consistent qualitatively with the subsequent polarization decrease .",
    "it should be emphasised , however , that at the late nebular epoch ( @xmath84 d ) the theoretical polarization is somewhat higher than the observed one .",
    "the primary goal of the paper was to provide an answer to the question whether the asymmetry of the @xmath0ni distribution responsible for the asymmetry of the h@xmath1 emission line at the nebular epoch of sn 2004dj is able to account for the observed polarization as well .",
    "i constructed a model of the h@xmath1 profile and luminosity with the nonthermal excitation and ionization of hydrogen for the asymmetric @xmath0ni distribution .",
    "i then calculated the transfer of a polarized radiation using monte carlo technique .",
    "the modelling shows that the model of the bipolar ejecta , which describes the h@xmath1 line , predicts that the model polarization is consistent with the observed polarization in sn  2004dj at the early nebular epoch . at the late stage",
    "@xmath84 d the theoretical polarization is somewhat larger compared with observations .",
    "this disparity is possibly related with a more complicated structure of the matter distribution , including @xmath0ni , in the inner zone of the envelope .",
    "the photospheric component of the polarization observed on day 107 is not described in principle by the model of the axisymmtric @xmath0ni ejecta .",
    "leonard et al . ( 2006 ) attribute the early polarization to the deviation of the bipolar @xmath0ni ejecta from the axial symmetry .",
    "according to their conjecture the recombination wave propagating toward the center of the supernova envelope uncovers in sequence layers with different position angles of @xmath0ni clumps .",
    "this might explain the observed change of polarization position angle between days 107 and 144 .",
    "in this model the photosphere plays a role of a homogeneous screen , while asymmetry arise from the enhanced ionization originated from the asymmetric @xmath0ni distribution . the scenario proposed by leonard et al .",
    "( 2006 ) can be dubbed `` the model of non - axisymmetric @xmath0ni ejecta '' .",
    "an alternative conjecture that does not require abandoning the axial symmetry of @xmath0ni ejecta is conceivable either .",
    "note , the photospheric component of the polarization emerged at the phase when the photosphere almost reached the center of the supernova envelope . on the other hand",
    ", the distribution of the chemical abundance in the inner layers of supernova should be essentially inhomogeneous due to an incomplete mixing of the hydrogen and helium enevelopes during the shock wave propagation ( mller et al .",
    "the photosphere that forms in the chemically inhomogeneous material unavoidably should acquire large scale brightness variations that might result in a significant polarization of the photospheric radiation .",
    "such a scenario one may dub a model of `` spotty photosphere '' in contrast to the model of non - axysymmetric @xmath0ni ejecta .    in both conjectures the early polarization is related to the final photospheric phase and in both mechanisms a `` flash '' of polarization should generally emerge at the end of the light curve plateau .",
    "the difference is that in the model of the spotty photosphere the polarization flash should be present even in sn  iip with the almost spherical @xmath0ni distribution , while the model based on the @xmath0ni asymmetry predicts in this case essentially weak / no polarization .",
    "this signature can be used to discriminate between alternative conjectures about the origin of the photospheric component of polarization in sn  2004dj and other sn  iip with the detected polarization flash ."
