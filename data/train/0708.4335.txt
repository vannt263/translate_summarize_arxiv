    "in 1977 berry @xcite conjectured that wave functions of generic chaotic systems , @xmath0 , can statistically be written as random superposition of a complete set of functions , @xmath1 , @xmath2 where the coefficients @xmath3 are independent identically distributed random variables with zero mean and variance obtained from normalization . in particular , any wave function of a two - dimensional billiard obeys the helmholtz equation with energy @xmath4 @xmath5 and can be represented as a formal sum @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are polar coordinates and @xmath9 are the usual bessel functions . for problems without magnetic field wave functions are real and @xmath10 .",
    "consider a chaotic quantum system like the stadium billiard with dirichlet boundary conditions and let us calculate ( numerically ) a large number of eigenfunctions with energies close to @xmath11 .",
    "each eigenfunction gives a well defined set of coefficients , @xmath3 in the expansion ( [ bessel ] ) and it is of interest to know mean values of different functions of these coefficients over the whole ensemble of eigenfunctions .",
    "berry s conjecture means that in the semiclassical limit @xmath12 the result will be the same as if the coefficients @xmath3 would be independent gaussian random variables with @xmath13    though berry s conjecture is one of the oldest conjectures in quantum chaos it has not yet been proved rigorously .",
    "numerically it works very well . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we present two pictures , the left one is a true eigenfunction of a quarter of the stadium with area equal @xmath14 and the right is a random realization of ( [ bessel ] ) with approximately the same energy . in these figures",
    "back and white regions represent nodal domains where the function is , respectively , positive and negative .",
    "the two figures look very similar and the left figure was magnified in order to distinguish better the circular arc of the stadium billiard where the true wave function is zero .    in 2002",
    "blum , gnutzmann and smilansky attracted wide attention to such type of pictures by initiating the investigation of nodal domains of wave functions for different systems @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that nodal domains of chaotic wave functions ( like in figure  [ fig1 ] ) can adequately be described by a critical percolation model .",
    "this conjecture gives a very detailed description of nodal domains and a large number of interesting ( global ) quantities can directly be transposed from percolation results ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it was shown in @xcite that the total number of connected nodal domains for random wave functions has gaussian distribution with mean value , @xmath15 , and variance , @xmath16 , given by the following expressions @xmath17 and @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the mean number of eigenvalues with energy less than @xmath20 . for billiards ,",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is the billiard area .    in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that these relations are well fulfilled by random wave functions . for completeness",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig2 ] the energy dependence of number of nodal domains computed numerically for true eigenfunctions of a quarter of the stadium close to the @xmath23 level .",
    "this figure confirms that expression ( [ mean ] ) agrees well with the results of numerical calculations for chaotic wave functions .",
    "still the numerical data present deviations from the expected value ( [ mean ] ) larger than it follows from ( [ variance ] ) .",
    "the origin of such large fluctuations is related with the existence of wave function scars . for illustration we present in figure  [ fig3 ] pictures of nodal domains corresponding to the two lowest points in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that these pictures have two different parts .",
    "one shows a regular pattern typical for integrable systems and the other is practically indistinguishable from a random wave function as in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is evident that quasi - regular regions are related to the bouncing ball scar .",
    "the left eigenfunction corresponds to the single excitation of the bouncing ball and the right one demonstrates the double perpendicular excitation .",
    "regions of quasi ",
    "integrable behavior have considerably less number of nodal domains than chaotic regions which explains the wide distribution of points in figure  [ fig2 ] .    in @xcite",
    "it was also checked that the distribution of nodal domain areas agrees with the percolation theory prediction @xmath24 and the the fractal dimension of nodal clusters is close to the percolation value @xmath25 these and other numerical calculations confirm that nodal domains of random wave functions ( and of chaotic quantum systems ) are correctly described by critical percolation theory .",
    "however , this conjecture has an intrinsic difficulty @xcite .",
    "the standard percolation theory deals with the following situation .",
    "one has a lattice with each site ( or edge ) positive with probability @xmath26 or negative with probability @xmath27 .",
    "the important assumption here is that these probabilities ( or concentrations ) at different points are independent random variables . for random and chaotic wave functions",
    "this is not the case . from ( [ bessel ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath28 and the values of the wave function at two points are correlated @xmath29 where @xmath30 in mathematical literature one often defines a gaussian random function without explicit representation as in ( [ berry ] ) but by postulating its mean value and variance ( cf .",
    "( [ mean_value ] ) and ( [ thevariance ] ) ) , all other correlation functions being determined by the wick theorem .",
    "it is well known @xcite that for a gaussian random function the probability that its value at two points has the same sign is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the two  point correlation function divided by its value at @xmath33 so that @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , if a random gaussian function is positive at a point , at all close - by points it will be also positive with probability close to @xmath35 . only at large distances",
    "when @xmath36 probabilities of being positive and negative become equal as in the usual percolation . for random wave functions @xmath37 coincides with @xmath38 in ( [ two_point ] ) and because @xmath39 the random wave function correlation function decays quite slowly ( @xmath40 ) which may destroy the validity of percolation theory .",
    "one of the purpose of this paper is to show that this is not the case . in section  [ harris ]",
    "we use so - called harris criterion @xcite to demonstrate that the oscillating character of the correlation function ( [ two_point ] ) leads to strong cancelations and even the slow decay as in ( [ decay ] ) is sufficient in order that nodal domains of random wave functions be in the same universality class as non - correlated percolation .",
    "though harris criterion is not mathematically rigorous , it is widely accepted ( see e.g. @xcite ) and its fulfillment is a strong argument in favor of the validity of the conjecture that nodal domains of random wave functions in the semiclassical limit @xmath41 are described by critical percolation . in section  [ level ]",
    "we generalize this conjecture to level domains i.e. regions where @xmath42 is bigger ( or smaller ) than a non - zero value @xmath43 .",
    "we argue that such domains are also described by percolation theory but this time by the non - critical percolation and the deviation from criticality is proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "harris proposed his criterion in 1974 @xcite to investigate the influence of random defects on the critical behavior of the ising model .",
    "later it was applied to many other models . in particular , in @xcite it was used for correlated percolation and we follow closely this paper .",
    "let us consider a critical percolation problem where concentrations in different sites , denoted by @xmath0 , are correlated .",
    "the criticality condition means that the mean concentration in each site equals a critical value @xmath44 @xmath45 below we assume that the connected part of the two  point correlation function of concentrations depends only on the difference between these points @xmath46 harris criterion was developed to give a condition on function @xmath38 under which correlations are unessential and critical properties of the problem under consideration are the same as for non - correlated percolation .",
    "harris argumentation is as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath47 be the average concentration in a finite volume @xmath48 @xmath49 the mean value of @xmath47 over realizations equals the critical value @xmath50 but for a given realization it differs from it .",
    "consider the situation when inside the volume @xmath48 all sites have the same concentration @xmath47 .",
    "as @xmath51 , it corresponds to a non - critical percolation . from the percolation theory",
    "it is known that points are uncorrelated if they are separated by a distance larger than a certain correlation length ( the cluster size ) @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is certain critical index . for the standard two - dimensional percolation @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath47 is close to @xmath44 this correlation length is large but finite .",
    "divide the whole space into cells of radius of order of @xmath52 in ( [ xi ] ) .",
    "different cells can be considered as uncorrelated but inside each cell concentrations are correlated .",
    "the natural measure of the importance of correlations is the variance , @xmath56 , of @xmath47 which can be computed from the knowledge of the two - point correlation function ( [ correlation ] ) @xmath57 harris criterion @xcite , @xcite states that if the variance is small with respect to @xmath58 , @xmath59 correlations are unessential and all critical quantities are the same as for the standard uncorrelated percolation .",
    "as the integrant in ( [ delta ] ) depends only on the distance between two points one usually simplifies this integral without discussion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) by assuming that one point is somewhere inside @xmath48 and the second point is on a distance @xmath7 of the order of the initial cell size so that the double integral in ( [ delta ] ) can be rewritten as a simple one @xmath60 when the @xmath61-dimensional cell @xmath48 is of the radius @xmath52 , eq .",
    "( [ standard_1 ] ) leads to the following widely used expression @xmath62 if the correlation function decreases as a certain power of the distance @xmath63 one gets @xmath64 therefore @xmath65 the comparison with ( [ harris_crit ] ) leads to the standard harris criterion @xcite that correlations are unessential provided min@xmath66 .    for random wave functions @xmath38 decays as in ( [ decay ] ) and because for the two  dimensional percolation @xmath55 harris criterion seems to indicate that random waves can not be described by usual percolation model . but the above considerations are valid only when the correlation function @xmath38 is positive . when it has oscillations , formulae ( [ standard_1 ] ) and ( [ standard_2 ] ) can not be correct as by definition @xmath56 is non - negative but these expressions may change the sign .",
    "the main point is that the double integral in ( [ delta ] ) can not , in general , be approximated by the simple integral ( [ standard_1 ] ) .    for random wave functions correlation function",
    "is given by ( [ two_point ] ) @xmath67 assuming for simplicity that region @xmath48 is a circle , all integrals over polar angles vanish except the one with @xmath68 and @xmath69 therefore in this case @xmath70 finally as @xmath55 one concludes that @xmath71 which means that harris criterion is fulfilled and nodal domains of random ( and chaotic ) wave functions in the universal ( continuum limit ) have the same critical behavior as the standard critical percolation model .",
    "the success of percolation  like description of nodal domains of random wave functions naturally leads to different generalizations .",
    "in particular , it was mentioned in @xcite that level domains of random functions can also be described by percolation theory .",
    "but contrary to the above case one has to consider not critical but non - critical percolation theory .",
    "level domains are regions where a function is bigger than a certain value @xmath72 with @xmath73 . to understand better how level domains look like we present in figure  [ fig4 ] two pictures .",
    "the left one displays nodal domains for one realization of a random wave function ( [ bessel ] ) .",
    "boundaries between black and white nodal regions correspond to nodal lines where @xmath74 .",
    "the right figure represents level domains of the same wave function .",
    "white ( resp .",
    "black ) regions are domains where @xmath42 is bigger ( resp .",
    "lower ) than @xmath75 ( in a certain normalization ) . boundaries between these regions ( called level lines ) are solutions of equation @xmath76 .",
    "both figures look quite similar . to stress their difference the largest connected clusters in both figures",
    "are highlighted . in the left figure",
    "this cluster connects different boundaries but does not cover the whole region . on the contrary , in the right figure the cluster fills practically all allowed space .",
    "this behavior is quite reminiscent of percolation transition . at critical concentration there",
    "exist an infinite cluster and a large number of finite clusters ( cf .",
    "( [ fisher ] ) and ( [ fractal ] ) ) . when the concentration is bigger than the critical , one infinite cluster with the dimension equal to the space dimension appears .    .",
    "in the both figures the largest connected clusters are highlighted . ]    to quantify different relations between level domains and non - critical percolation we use one  parameter scaling which is assumed to be valid for non - critical percolation not too far from criticality . according to the scaling conjecture",
    "all quantity for non - critical percolation with concentration @xmath26 are the same as for critical percolation with concentration @xmath44 multiplied by a function depending only on one universal combination of parameters .",
    "for example , the number of cluster of size @xmath77 in critical case is given by ( [ fisher ] ) .",
    "for non - critical percolation it takes the following form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a certain function depending on the universal argument @xmath80 here @xmath81 and @xmath82 are universal critical indices . for two - dimensional percolation",
    "they are known analytically ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath83 in ( [ scaling ] ) only the constants @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and the threshold value @xmath44 depend on micro details of the problem such as the type of percolation ( side or edge percolation ) and the form of the lattice ( triangular , square , etc . ) .",
    "the indices @xmath81 , @xmath82 and the function @xmath79 are assumed to be universal ( but depend on dimensionality of the problem ) .    scaling and universality are very important properties of non - critical percolation theory",
    ". we will now check that they are also well fulfilled for level domains of random wave functions .",
    "first we need a relation between the deviation from criticality , @xmath86 , and @xmath43 in ( [ epsilon ] ) . to simplify the formulas below it is convenient to normalize billiard wave functions by the condition @xmath87 where @xmath22 is the billiard area .    with this normalization random wave functions ( [ bessel ] )",
    "are gaussian random functions with @xmath88 ( cf .",
    "( [ two_point ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the probability density that @xmath89 is @xmath90 and the probability @xmath91 that @xmath92 takes the form @xmath93 consequently , for small @xmath43 @xmath94 and for level domains the scaling relations as in ( [ scaling ] ) are valid with the substitution @xmath95 .",
    "consider first the total number of connected level domains .",
    "for this quantity there exists no explicit scale as in ( [ scaling ] ) and the scaling prediction is particular simple . for the non - critical percolation @xmath96",
    "so for level domains it should be @xmath97 with a certain constant @xmath98 and the same function @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath99 is the mean number of connected clusters for a percolation model with concentration @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath100 is the same quantity but for level domains ( [ epsilon ] ) .",
    "@xmath101 is the mean number of nodal domains given by ( [ mean ] ) .    in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "there are two curves .",
    "the solid line is the ratio ( [ n_level ] ) computed numerically for random gaussian functions .",
    "data are well fitted by a quadratic fit @xmath102 .",
    "the dashed line represents the ratio ( [ n_perc ] ) computed numerically for bond percolation on @xmath103 square lattice .",
    "black circles result from the rescaling @xmath104 .",
    "it is clearly seen that points for level domains after rescaling agree very well with data from pure percolation which confirms the scaling ( [ n_perc ] ) and ( [ n_level ] ) .    in figures",
    "[ fig6 ]  [ fig7 ] we present the verification of ( [ scaling ] ) for level domains of random wave functions . in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "the number of clusters with area @xmath77 is plotted for a few different values of @xmath43 and @xmath105 .",
    "curves are clearly different and slopes for @xmath73 differ from the critical percolation value ( [ fisher ] ) predicted for nodal domains .",
    "then we rescale these data using as the abscissa axis the variable @xmath106 as it follows from the one - parameter scaling .",
    "the resulting points are concentrated close to each other and in the left of figure  [ fig7 ] the solid line indicates the average of all such calculations which supports the existence of scaling for level domains . in the same figure two more curves are presented .",
    "the dashed line represents the results of similar calculations but for the non - critical bond percolation on a square @xmath103 lattice and the dotted line is the same but on a square lattice with @xmath107 sites . for these curves",

    "once more the scaling relation is well satisfied . finally on the right part of figure  [ fig8 ]",
