    "the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) entails in a broad sweep knowledge of the diverse properties of nuclear matter : its saturation density , energy per nucleon @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the density ) , incompressibility @xmath1 , the symmetry energy and its density content , @xmath4 the symmetry coefficient @xmath5 , the symmetry slope parameter @xmath6 , the symmetry incompressibility @xmath7 and all the higher symmetry derivatives . a cultivated attention is naturally drawn in recent times to have a refined understanding of this nuclear eos from both experimental and theoretical sides .",
    "the binding energies of stable atomic nuclei are the most accurately known experimental entities in nuclear physics , these supplemented with knowledge of giant monopole and dipole resonances followed by theoretical analysis have yielded some of the eos parameters like the saturation density @xmath8 of symmetric nuclear matter and @xmath9 and @xmath10 in reasonably tight bounds @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the symmetry derivatives @xmath11 and @xmath12 is still not very certain @xcite .",
    "analyses of the different nuclear observables do not help much in removing the uncertainty .",
    "correlation systematics of nuclear isospin with neutron skin thickness @xcite , isospin diffusion @xcite , nucleon emission ratios @xcite or isoscaling @xcite in heavy ion collisions , all yield values of the symmetry slope parameter @xmath13 that are not much in consonance with one another .",
    "some attempt was recently made to constrain @xmath14 in tighter bounds from nuclear masses aided by microscopic calculations @xcite on neutron skin of heavy nuclei , it was found to give @xmath14 = 59 @xmath15 13.0 mev .",
    "other recent attempts , from analysis of the isovector giant dipole and quadrupole resonances in @xmath16pb nucleus @xcite give @xmath14 = 43@xmath17 and 37@xmath1518 mev respectively .",
    "this underscores the still unresolved uncertainty in getting to the value of @xmath14 and asks for newer avenues to understand it .",
    "the present state of the art on symmetry energy and related parameters can be found in the topical issue on nuclear symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "the eos parameters so mentioned pertain to only one density , the saturation density @xmath8 . if all of them are known",
    "precisely , it is in principle possible to construct with a suitable energy density functional ( edf ) the nuclear eos @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the isospin asymmetry .",
    "whereas the high density end of the eos would be of immediate value in understanding the dynamical evolution of the core collapse of a massive star and the associated explosive nucleosynthesis @xcite or the radii and lower bound of the maximum mass of cold neutron stars @xcite , the low - density end helps in getting a closer estimate of the neutron skin thickness or the neutron density distribution @xcite in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "further information on the eos parameters at densities other than @xmath8 may put the nuclear eos on firmer grounds , unfortunately , there are only a few of them . at density",
    "higher than @xmath8 , information from experimental data has still large uncertainty @xcite ; at sub - saturation density , from giant dipole resonance analysis , a quantitative constraint on @xmath5 could be put as 23.3 mev @xmath2024.9 mev @xcite .",
    "further information derived from theoretical analyses at around this density may be of added significance , ( i ) the energy per nucleon of neutron matter is @xmath21 mev at @xmath3= 0.1 @xmath22 @xcite and ( ii ) the density derivative of the nuclear incompressibility @xmath23 1100@xmath1570 mev where @xmath24 is @xmath25 0.7@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "as is evident from the previous discussion , the plethora of nuclear eos failed to effectively well - constrain the density content of the nuclear symmetry energy and the nuclear incompressibility from fits to diverse microscopic nuclear data .",
    "the reason lies in the choice of different sets of microscopic observables to be fitted .",

    ", we have tried to find how the input of the empirical knowledge of these quantities can be used to construct an edf for nuclear matter and to predict the as yet not so well - constrained density dependence of its symmetry properties in reasonably tighter bounds .",

    "@xcite which can lead to somewhat different predictions depending on the observables chosen to be explored , the alternate edifice for the nuclear edf built in this article on the well established nuclear bulk parameters is so structured , as we see later , that it gives an easy and transparent look to the correlations of the predicted values of the density derivatives of the symmetry energy and the nuclear incompressibility to the input parameters .",
