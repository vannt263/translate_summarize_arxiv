    "blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei characterized by high flux variability at all wavelengths and compact ( milli - arcsecond scale ) radio emission of extreme brightness temperatures , often exceeding the compton limit @xcite .",
    "their radio spectra are generally well - described by a power - law shape , with a `` flat '' spectral index @xmath2 ( where the flux density @xmath3 ) .",
    "multi - epoch vlbi ( very long baseline interferometry ) observations often show superluminal expansion , and the radio and optical emission is usually highly polarized .",
    "these general properties are well - described as arising in a relativistic jet pointing close to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the jet , presumably deriving its power from accretion onto a supermassive , rotating black hole surrounded by an accretion disk , contains ultrarelativistic electrons ( with particle lorentz factors @xmath4 reaching @xmath5 , depending on the object ) .",
    "these relativistic electrons produce soft photons from radio up to uv ( or in some cases , soft x - rays ) through synchrotron emission , and high - energy photons up to tev energies , via the inverse - compton process which involves scattering of synchrotron photons ( the ssc scenario ) , as well as scattering of externally produced soft photons ( the external radiation compton , erc , scenario ) . a contribution to the high energy radiation",
    "can also be provided by synchrotron radiation of pair cascades powered by hadronic processes and by synchrotron emission of ultra - high - energy protons and muons ( see reviews of radiative models of blazars by @xcite ) .",
    "noting difficulties of hadronic models to explain the spectra of luminous blazars @xcite , we investigate in this paper only leptonic models , i.e. , the models which involve production of radiation by directly accelerated electrons .",
    "densely sampled , simultaneous monitoring observations throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the radio to @xmath0-ray bands can provide important constraints on such models .    when emission lines are absent or weak , with an equivalent width ( ew ) less than 5   in the rest frame ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a blazar is classified as a bl lac object ; otherwise it belongs to the class of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "while in a majority of bl lac objects - especially in those with the @xmath6 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaking in the far uv - to x - ray range ( the so - called hsp , or `` high - synchrotron peaked bl lac objects '' ) - detection of emission lines is rare , and if detected , the lines are extremely weak ( for recent measurements , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in the objects where the sed peaks in the infrared or optical range ( the so - called lsp , or `` low - synchrotron peaked bl lac objects '' ) , easily discernible emission lines have been detected often .",
    "when detected , such lines provide a measurement of redshift , but also yield crucial information about the details of accretion in the central source . in some cases such as @xcite , discussed in this paper , and even bl lacertae @xcite ,",
    "the prototype of the bl lac class , the ew of emission lines can vary from one observational epoch to another .",
    "this is primarily due to large - amplitude variability of the nonthermal continuum , which becomes brighter or fainter with respect to the presumably less - variable emission lines .",
    "regardless , the detailed properties of the emission lines are crucial in establishing the radiative environment encountered by the jet emerging from the nucleus , and thus are indispensable in establishing the most likely source of seed - photon population for inverse compton scattering .",
    "while the most compelling scenario has the internal jet photons dominating this population in the hsp sub - class , and the external photons ( from emission - line region , or disk photons rescattered by the medium confining the lines ) in fsrqs , the situation with lsp bl lac objects is unclear .",
    "studies of an lsp blazar provide an exceptional opportunity to answer this question .",
    "it is one of the original bl lac objects in the @xcite compilation , discovered via optical identification of a variable radio source by @xcite .",
    "early observations - as well as the inspection of historical plates - revealed that optical variability can range over 5 magnitudes @xcite , motivating monitoring observations over a wide range of frequencies since its discovery .",
    "the redshift @xmath7 has been inferred from weak optical emission lines by @xcite , but even earlier optical spectroscopy revealed two absorption line systems , one at @xmath8 , and another , weaker one at @xmath9 discovered by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the intervening @xmath8 system has also been detected in absorption in the radio , via the redshifted hydrogen 21 cm line by @xcite and @xcite , but also as a ly@xmath10 absorber , revealing damped ly@xmath10 properties @xcite , and implying _ a considerable absorption in other bands_. detailed studies of that absorbing system by @xcite allow accurate corrections to be applied to the observed optical spectra in order to determine reliably the intrinsic spectrum of the blazar .",
    "likewise , since the environment in the field of is complex and includes several possibly interacting foreground galaxies at @xmath8 as well as the system at @xmath9 , the _ emission _ in the optical - uv band ( and to much lesser degree , in the soft x - ray band ) may be contaminated .",
    "one galaxy , probably a normal spiral , is 1.3 arcsec east , while another object , about 2  arcsec to the south , is known to be an agn and could affect the flux of when it is very faint , especially in the bluer part of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "historical data for this source are abundant .",
    "radio observations were performed by many instruments , starting from about 100  mhz up to 300  ghz , and including multi - epoch vlbi studies @xcite .",
    "space and ground - based infrared data are available from sub - mm ( far - ir ) down to micron wavelengths ( near - ir ) ; optical bands , ubvri , have been extensively monitored by many telescopes around the world . has also been detected in the high energy band by essentially all soft x - ray observatories including @xmath11 ( @xcite ) , @xmath12 ( @xcite ) , @xmath13 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath14 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , _ beppo - sax _ ( @xcite ) , @xmath15 ( @xcite ) , and _ xmm - newton _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "this source has also been identified as a powerful and strongly variable @xmath0-ray emitter via observations by @xmath16 onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( @xmath17 ) in the high @xmath0-ray energy range from 30  mev to 20  gev , with six pointings between 1992 and 1997 providing two detections @xcite and four upper limits .",
    "the mid - energy @xmath0-ray emission was probed by _ comptel _ during @xmath17 cycle 4 ( 1994 - 1995 ) , yielding only upper limits for the flux in the interval of 0.75 - 30  mev .",
    "these numerous multi - wavelength observations show that is characterized by extreme variability on long ( month - years ) and short ( intraday ) time scales over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the study of blazars , of their broad - band spectra and of their complex variability , has been greatly enriched since the start of scientific observations with the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) in 2008 august @xcite thanks to its high sensitivity and essentially uninterrupted observations afforded by the survey mode .",
    "such new and sensitive @xmath0-ray observations motivated many multi - band campaigns , often conducted with dedicated facilities , and was ( and continues to be ) one of the well - sampled targets .",
    "this paper presents the results of the lat monitoring of , as reported in section [ sec : fermi ] .",
    "the description of multi - wavelength observations conducted between 2008 august and 2009 february when the source showed strong activity in @xmath0-rays as well as in radio through optical and x - ray bands @xcite , follows in section [ sec : mw_data ] .",
    "the analysis of those data , including the discussion of the temporal profiles measured in various bands and the connection to the @xmath0-ray activity , is reported in section [ sec : mw_lightcurve ] .",
    "a significant part of these data have been independently analyzed by @xcite . in section [ sec : sed ] we present the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and its temporal behavior , and discuss the implications of the data on the modeling of emission processes and the structure of the jet in : there , we argue that while the equivalent width of emission lines in this object might suggest a classification as a bl lac object , the isotropic luminosity inferred from the data indicates it is a quasar . in section [ sec : modeling ] , we show models of the broad - band emission in the context of synchrotron + compton models .",
    "our consideration of the broad - band sed suggests that the most likely mechanism for @xmath0-ray emission is comptonization of circumnuclear ir radiation from dust , commonly present in quasars .",
    "this is a different scenario from the one proposed by @xcite , who argued for the synchrotron self - compton process .",
    "we discuss these two approaches in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the lat , the primary instrument onboard the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray observatory , is an electron - positron pair conversion telescope sensitive to @xmath0-rays of energies from 20  mev to @xmath18 300  gev .",
    "the lat consists of a high - resolution silicon microstrip tracker , a csi hodoscopic electromagnetic calorimeter and an anticoincidence detector for the identification of charged particles background .",
    "the full description of the instrument and its performance can be found in @xcite .",
    "the large field of view ( @xmath192.4  sr ) allows the lat to observe the full sky in survey mode every 3  hours .",
    "the lat point spread function ( psf ) strongly depends on both the energy and the conversion point in the tracker , but less so on the incidence angle .",
    "for 1  gev normal - incidence conversions in the upper section of the tracker the psf 68@xmath20 containment radius is 0.8@xmath21 .",

    "were excluded from the data set .",
    "in addition , events with zenith angles larger than 105@xmath21 with respect to the earth reference frame @xcite were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the data were analyzed with an unbinned maximum likelihood technique described by @xcite using the analysis software ( gtlike ) developed by the lat team .",
    "accurate spectral and flux measurements require a reliable accounting for the diffuse foreground due to the galactic interstellar emission , as well as the extragalactic diffuse @xmath0-ray emission , the residual cosmic ray background , and contamination from nearby sources .",
    "the fitting procedure simultaneously fits for the parameters of the source of interest as well as of nearby @xmath0-ray sources and the diffuse backgrounds , which in turn have been modeled using gll@xmath22iem@xmath22v02 for the galactic diffuse emission and isotropic@xmath22iem@xmath22v02 for the extragalactic isotropic emission models .",

    "they included the vlbi imaging data , and concluded that the @xmath0-ray emission zone is associated with the 7  mm radio core ( i.e. at @xmath142 from the bh ) and propose that production of @xmath0-rays is dominated by a turbulent multi - zone ssc process .",
    "we comment on these differences below , noting that we perform detailed modelling of the broad - band spectrum of the object .    as the long term radio light curves of indicate , the active season in 2008 started about 200 days before reaching the maximum . during this period of time",
    "any portion of the jet propagates over a distance of @xmath143 tens of parsecs , i.e. much larger than the length of a blazar zone inferred from the time scales of the short term flares .",

    "particularly prominent flares are seen in the optical light curves .",
    "their @xmath33-day time scales imply that the extension of the dissipative zone is @xmath144 which nicely corresponds with the location of the blazar zone derived from our model . in order to form such flares at a distance of @xmath145 , a lorentz factor of @xmath146",
    "is required .",
    "interestingly , a similarly large lorentz factor is required in the @xcite model to explain the observed @xmath147-day time scale of the flux decay at @xmath148 .",
    "this can be inferred by taking into account that radiative cooling of electrons emitting at 1 mm is inefficient and that the time scale of the flux decrease , as determined by the adiabatic losses , is @xmath149 .",
    "vlbi observations of do not exclude such a large value of the bulk lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "finally we comment about the objections made by @xcite regarding the application of erc models for the production of @xmath0 rays in .",
    "they pointed out that in this model it is impossible to explain the lack of correlation between short - term variations of the @xmath0-ray and optical fluxes because of a lack of variations of the external radiation field .",
    "however , in the fast cooling regime , variations of the inverse - compton flux are determined not by variations of the seed radiation field but by variations of the electron injection function .",
    "it does not matter whether the seed radiation is external or internal , so this criticism may also be applied to the ssc models .",
    "hence , the lack of a clear correspondence between variations in these two spectral bands must have a different origin than fluctuations in the background radiation .",
    "they can be related to variations of the doppler factor and magnetic fields in the kinematically and geometrically complex dissipative zone . in particular",
