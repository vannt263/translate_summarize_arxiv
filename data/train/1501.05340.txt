    "wave phenomena are pervasive throughout many scientific fields , wave computation has been one of the central topics in computational sciences and has also been at the forefront of scientific computing . it becomes more and more important as the boundary of wave - related application problems keeps pushing outward .",
    "solving these application problems largely hinges on computing the solutions of the governing wave equation(s ) . among them",
    "those involving high frequency waves are often most difficult to analyze and solve numerically .",
    "this is due to the fact that a high frequency ( or large wave number ) , which means a very short wave length , results in a strongly indefinite pde problem and a highly oscillatory solution .",
    "consequently , very fine meshes must be used to resolve the wave , which in turn results in extremely large non - hermitian and strongly indefinite algebraic systems to solve , a daunting task especially in high dimensions .    in this paper",
    "we shall focus our attention on one type of wave phenomena , that is wave propagation through some isotropic elastic media .",
    "this type is often encountered in applications from materials science , medical science , petroleum engineering , just to name a few .",
    "specifically , we shall consider the following elastic helmholtz problem : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , which represents an isotropic elastic media , is an open and bounded domain .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the unit outward normal vector to @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes the imaginary unit .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the ( fourier - transformed ) displacement vector of the elastic media @xmath12 . @xmath0 and @xmath13 are both positive constants for which @xmath0 denotes the frequency of the sought - after elastic wave traveling through @xmath12 with speed @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a @xmath15 real symmetric positive definite matrix .",
    "@xmath16 is the stress - tensor in @xmath12 defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the lam constants for the elastic media @xmath12 .",
    "equations and can arise either from the frequency domain treatment of linear elastic wave equations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or from seeking a time - harmonic solution to the following linear elastic wave equations : @xmath20 when @xmath21 the boundary condition is known as the first - order absorbing ( radiation ) boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this boundary condition is an artificial boundary condition which has the property of completely absorbing incoming plane waves that are perpendicular to the boundary @xmath22 .",
    "this boundary condition is imposed on the boundary @xmath22 of the truncated domain @xmath23 of some unbounded domain with the intent of making the problem computationally feasible .    as is the case for the scalar helmholtz equation , which governs time - harmonic acoustic waves",
    ", the frequency @xmath0 also plays a key role in the analysis and implementation of any numerical method for the elastic helmholtz equations .",
    "it is a well - known fact that in order to resolve the wave numerically one must use some minimum number of grid points in each wave length @xmath24 in every coordinate direction .",
    "this requires a minimum mesh constraint @xmath25 , where @xmath1 denotes the mesh size .",
    "the widely held  rule of thumb \" is to use @xmath26 grid points per wave length . in @xcite , babska _",
    "et al _ proved the necessity of this  rule of thumb \" in the @xmath27-dimensional case of the scalar helmholtz equation .",
    "in @xcite it was also shown that the h@xmath28 error bound for the finite element solution contains a pollution term that contributes to the loss of stability for the finite element method in the case of a large frequency .",
    "this pollution term also causes the error to increase as @xmath0 increases under the mesh constraint @xmath25 .",
    "this forces one to adopt a more stringent mesh condition to guarantee an accurate numerical solution .",
    "the loss of stability of the standard finite element method applied to helmholtz - type problems remains as an open issue to be resolved . in @xcite a stringent mesh condition of @xmath29 ( called the asymptotic mesh regime ) was required to obtain optimal and quasi - optimal error estimates for the scalar helmholtz equation . in @xcite a similar mesh constraint of the form @xmath30",
    "was used to obtain error estimates for the elastic helmholtz equations , where @xmath31 is a constant to be discussed later in this paper .",
    "requiring such a stringent mesh constraint makes the use of a practical coarse approximation space impossible in the case that @xmath0 is large .",
    "this is a major hurdle that must be overcome if one wishes to use multi - level algebraic solvers such as the multigrid method or the multi - level domain decomposition method .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to develop and analyze an interior penalty discontinuous galerkin approximation method which is unconditionally stable with respect to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the above elastic helmholtz problem , which is different from the goal of the earlier dg work @xcite .",
    "specifically , we seek a numerical method in which a priori solution ( or stability ) estimates can be obtained for all @xmath32 .",
    "our work in this paper can be regarded as the elastic counterpart of those reported in @xcite , where the scalar helmholtz equation and the time - harmonic maxwell s equations were the focuses of study .",
    "we like to note that all three helmholtz - type problems share the above mentioned two main difficulties , namely , strong indefiniteness and non - hermitian character .",
    "however , due to the fact that to their leading operators are very different , in particular , they have quite different kernel spaces , the formulation and analysis of the desired ip - dg methods are significantly different , although they are conceptually similar .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec-1b ]",
    "we establish a new generalized weak coercivity property for the elastic operator @xmath33 , and derive a stability estimate for the pde solution as a corollary of the generalized weak coercivity property . in section [ sec-2 ]",
    "we introduce some notation and present the formulation of our ip - dg method studied in the rest of the paper . in section [ sec-3 ]",
    "we derive a stability ( or a priori solution ) estimate for the numerical solution in all mesh regimes including the pre - asymptotic regime ( i.e. @xmath34 for some @xmath35 ) . in section [ sec-4 ]",
    "we employ the non - standard error estimate technique , which uses an elliptic projection along with the ( discrete ) stability estimate , to establish optimal order error estimates in both broken h@xmath28-norm and the @xmath3-norm .",
    "section [ sec : elastic_ipdg_numerics ] is devoted to numerical experiments that validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the proposed method s advantage over the standard finite element method .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove that the sesquilinear form @xmath36 defined in the weak formulation of  satisfies a generalized weak coercivity property .",
    "similar results were also obtained for the scalar helmholtz equation and the time - harmonic maxwell s equations @xcite . as a direct consequence of the weak coercivity property proved in this section , we will obtain stability estimates for the solution @xmath37 of .    throughout the rest of this paper we adopt the standard @xmath3-space norm and inner product notation .",
