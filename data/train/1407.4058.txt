    "the theoretical investigation and the phenomenological analysis of anisotropies in the cosmological microwave background ( c@xmath1b ) radiation is recursively considered as a singular valuable check on the validity of simple inflationary cosmological models .",

    "depending on the current thermodynamic regime , the free streaming massive neutrinos can affect the cosmological evolution of tensor modes by increasing the magnitude of the anisotropic stress , which acts as an effective viscosity , absorbing gravitational waves in the low frequency .",
