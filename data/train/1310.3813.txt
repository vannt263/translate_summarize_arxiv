    "ever since its discovery , graphene@xcite has shown a great potential for applications in nano - technology@xcite , especially in electronic transport@xcite .",
    "studies of superconductivity in graphite intercalation compounds ( gics)@xcite , recent experimental evidence of a superconducting state in graphite - sulfur composites@xcite , and the growing interest in superconducting nano - devices@xcite have motivated theoretical investigation of possible superconductivity in the two - dimensional graphene systems@xcite .",
    "single- and few - layer graphene may exhibit a superconducting state upon adatom deposition or intercalation .",
    "as in the case of alkali - metal and alkaline - earth gics , superconductivity in modified - graphene systems can be explained by the electron - phonon coupling enhancement that arises from the presence of an intercalant - derived band as well as graphitic @xmath1-bands at the fermi level@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies within the density functional theory ( dft ) framework were conducted on single- and few - layer graphene systems with intercalated and deposited dopants .",

    "they argued that removal of quantum confinement , in going from lic@xmath0 gic to li - covered monolayer graphene , could bring the li - derived states down in energy to the fermi level .",
    "this enhances the electron - phonon coupling strength , making li - covered single - layer graphene a superconductor at t@xmath8 k.    the recent fabrication of lithium intercalated graphene bilayer @xcite raises the question of whether this two - dimensional material would also exhibit a superconducting state .",
    "in addition , the possibility of a further enhancement of the electron - phonon coupling strength in few - layer graphene systems intercalated with lithium , remains an open issue .    in this work",

    "keeps the interlayer band from being occupied . as figure 3a reveals , the bottom of the li - derived band is @xmath62 ev above the fermi energy .",

    "in this work , we presented the results of calculations of the electronic structure and electron - phonon interaction for several configurations of graphene - lithium systems .",
    "we assessed the structural stability and the strength of the electron - phonon coupling with respect to the stacking sequence and number of layers of lithium adatoms and the graphene sheets .",

    "structural stability of the systems was later confirmed with the calculation of the phonon dispersion curves , which do not show the presence of any imaginary frequencies .",
    "we found that , in contrast to the corresponding gics , li - covered graphene systems exhibit an incomplete charge transfer from the lithium atoms to the graphene planes , giving rise to a lithium - derived band which crosses the fermi level simultaneously with graphitic @xmath1-bands .",
