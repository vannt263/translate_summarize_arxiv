    "in condensed matter physics there are several models presenting spatial modulated structures of some local property , such as , for instance , the position of the particles , the magnetization and the charge density bak1982 .",
    "such modulation can be commensurate or incommensurate in relation to the underlying lattice .",
    "a phase is named commensurate if the ratio between the period of the modulation  and the period of the lattice is a rational number . otherwise , the phase is named incommensurate .",
    "the basic mechanism leading to modulation is the competition between interactions favoring distinct orderings @xcite .",
    "for example , the modulated structures observed in rare - earth metals @xcite were interpreted as a consequence of the competition generated by the spatially oscillatory interaction rkky @xcite . in order to explain the spatial modulation found in erbium",
    ", elliott introduced an ising model @xcite , twenty years later named annni ( axial - next - nearest - neighbor ising ) model @xcite .",
    "it is one of the simplest models able to exhibit a rich phase diagram containing a complex region of spatially modulated phases selke1988,yeomans1988,selke1992 .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian    @xmath14 \\ \\sigma _ { x , y , z}% \\end{array}%\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is an ising spin variable at the site @xmath16 of a simple cubic lattice , @xmath17 is the nearest neighbor interaction in the @xmath18 planes , @xmath19and @xmath20 are the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interactions in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "* *  * * here @xmath21  and @xmath20  compete and may have opposite or same signs .",
    "however , when @xmath19  and @xmath20  have opposite signs , the competition between them may give rise to the modulated phases .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram of the model displaying the main commensurate phases in the plane of the reduced temperature @xmath22 against the competition parameter @xmath23 , shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] , was obtained in the beginning of the eighties @xcite  and is divided in three major regions : the modulated region ( m ) , the paramagnetic ( p ) and the ferromagnetic ( f ) phases . in this diagram , as well as in the whole paper , we make @xmath24 .",
    "the paramagnetic phase is separated from the ferromagnetic phase and from the modulated region by critical lines p - f and p - m respectively . on the other hand ,  a first - order transition ( f - m ) takes place between the ferromagnetic and the modulated region .",
    "the critical line p - m belongs to the universality class of the xy model , whereas the critical line p - f presents ising - like critical behavior @xcite .",
    "the transition lines p - f , p - m and f - m meet at the lifshitz point ( lp ) , introduced theoretically by hornreich et al . @xcite .",
    "the location of the lp in the phase diagram of the annni model was obtained for the first time from high temperature series technique @xcite . however",
    ", the precise location of the lp is difficult to obtain because , close to it , one meets the challenging task of dealing with modulated phases of very large periods .",
    "thus , latter attempts to locate the lp were made .",
    "single spin - flip monte carlo simulations were performed along the p - f critical line towards the lp @xcite , thus avoiding the modulated region . despite the successful results obtained from these works , it was only recently that the lifshitz point was located with high precision @xcite  by means of a new variation of the cluster wolf algorithm @xcite .",
    "concerning the critical properties of the lp , it was shown that this multicritical point belongs neither to the universality class of the xy model nor to the one of ising model @xcite .",
    "this fact gave rise to much interest in the study of the particular critical behavior of a lp .",
    "thus , the critical properties of the lp found in the phase diagram of the annni model were widely studied by several approaches hornreich1980,mo1991 , among them @xmath25expansions@xcite , high temperature series technique @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the most complete results concerning the lp were obtained for the magnetic compound mnp , which exhibits a lp belonging to the universality class of the lp present in the annni model @xcite .",
    "here it is important to mention that although this model has been widely explored by methods from equilibrium statistical mechanics , there are no results for the 3d annni model obtained by an approach that deals with mc simulations performed far from equilibrium @xcite that will be employed in this paper .",
    "however we remark that several works in the literature have used previously a dynamical approach to study the lifshitz points .",
    "for example the critical dynamics of relaxation of the model near the lifshitz point has been studied by the @xmath26expansion and the exponent @xmath1  was numerically estimated for uniaxial and biaxial cases @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in @xcite the growth of a order parameter is studied when a system at lifshitz point is quenched from the homogeneous disordered state to the ordered state where correlation and structure factors after quench in this system are analyzed via renormalization group method .",
    "numerical estimates of exponent @xmath1  are supplied in this same reference .",
    "studies about dynamics of annni model were developed but in two dimensional versions of the model but such works do not explore critical properties .",
    "for example , in @xcite , @xcite , the kinetics of domain growth of the one and two - dimensional anisotropic annni model was explored via monte carlo methods using glauber and heat - bath multispin dynamics respectively .    in the next subsection we briefly present the non - equilibrium approach to be used in our analysis .",
    "the study of critical properties originated from statistical fluctuations of spin systems became possible in non - equilibrium stage after the seminal ideas of janssen , schaub and schmittmann  @xcite and huse  huse1989 . by quenching systems from high temperatures to the critical one",
    ", they have shown that universality and scaling behavior appear even in the early stages of time evolving , via renormalization group techniques and numerical calculations respectively .",
    "hence , by using short time dynamics , one can often circumvent the well - known problem of the critical slowing down that plagues investigations of the long - time regime .    here",
    ", we briefly review finite size scaling in the dynamics relaxation of spin systems .",
    "we present our alternative derivation of some power laws in the short time dynamics context .",
    "readers , who want a more complete review about this topic , may want to read @xcite .",
    "this topic is based on time dependent simulations , and it constitutes an important issue in the context of phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "such methods can be applied not only to estimate the critical parameters in spin systems , but also to calculate the critical exponents ( static and dynamic ones ) through different scaling relations by setting different initial conditions .",
    "the dynamic scaling relation obtained by janssen _",
    "k_-th moment of the magnetization , is written as @xmath27where the arguments are : the time @xmath6 ; the reduced temperature @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the critical one , the lattice linear size @xmath30 and initial magnetization @xmath31 .",
    "here , the operator @xmath32 denotes averages over different configurations due to different possible time evolutions from each initial configuration compatible with a given @xmath31 .    on the right - hand side of the equation",
    ", one has : an arbitrary spatial rescaling factor @xmath33 ; an anomalous dimension @xmath34 related to @xmath31 .",
    "the exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the equilibrium critical exponents associated with the order parameter and the correlation length , respectively .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 is the dynamic one , which characterizes the time correlations in equilibrium . after choosing @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath29(@xmath37 ) , and @xmath38",
    "we obtain @xmath39 .    denoting @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", one has : @xmath42 .",
    "the derivative with respect to @xmath30 is : @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\]]where we have explicitly : @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the limit @xmath46 , @xmath47 ,",
    "one has : @xmath48 .",
    "the separability of the variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath51 leads to @xmath52 , where the prime means the derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "since the left - hand - side of this equation depends only on @xmath50 and the right - hand - side depends only on @xmath53 , they must be equal to a constant @xmath54 .",
    "thus , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , resulting in @xmath57 .",
    "returning to the original variables , one has : @xmath58 .",
    "on one hand , choosing @xmath59 and calculating @xmath60 , at criticality ( @xmath61 ) , we obtain @xmath62corresponding to a regime under small initial magnetization .",
    "this can be observed by a finite time scaling @xmath63 in equation ( mainshorttime ) , at critical temperature ( @xmath61 ) which leads to @xmath64 .",
    "defining @xmath65 , an expansion of the averaged magnetization around @xmath66 results in : @xmath67 . by construction @xmath68 , since @xmath69 and @xmath70 is a constant , discarding the quadratic terms we obtain the expected power law behavior @xmath71 .",
    "this anomalous behavior of initial magnetization is valid only for a characteristic time scale @xmath72 @xmath73 .    on the other hand",
    ", the choice @xmath74 corresponds to the case which the system does not depend on the initial trace and @xmath75 leads to simple power law : @xmath76that similarly corresponds to decay of magnetization for @xmath77 .",
    "the evaluation of critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath78 via monte carlo simulations concerns taking averages over different runs . in the second case ,",
    "simpler simulations are considered because since the system starts from the ferromagnetic ( ordered ) initial state . however ,",
    "the first one is somewhat difficult to deal with , once it demands working with prepared initial states with a precise value of @xmath31 ( sharp preparation ) , besides the delicate limit @xmath79 .",
    "an alternative way to determine this exponent was proposed by tom and oliveira @xcite , where it was shown that the time correlation function of the order parameter also follows a power law scale form at the short - time regime , i. e.    @xmath80    the main advantage in the use of eq .",
    "( [ correlation ] ) is that one does not need to fix precisely the initial order parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the only requirement is that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 stands for the average of the quantity @xmath83 over different initial configurations .",
    "now , let us look at the second moment of magnetization .",
    "since the spin - spin correlation @xmath84 is negligible for @xmath85 , we have that for a fixed @xmath6 , @xmath86and by considering the scaling relation ( with @xmath63 ) for the second moment of magnetization , we have according to [ mainshorttime ] :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the system dimension .    using monte carlo simulations ,",
    "many authors have obtained the dynamic exponents @xmath3 and @xmath1 as well as the static ones @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and other specific exponents for several models : baxter - wu  arashiro2003 , 2 , 3 and 4-state potts  @xcite , ising with multispin interactions  @xcite , ising with competing interactions @xcite , models with no defined hamiltonian ( celular automata )  @xcite , models with tricritical point  silvaii2002 , heisenberg  @xcite , protein folding  arashiro3 and so on .",
    "the sequence to determine the static exponents from short time dynamics is : first we determine @xmath1 , performing monte carlo simulations that mixes initial conditions  @xcite , and consider the power law for the cumulant @xmath89    this ratio has proven to be useful for the calculation of the exponent @xmath1 for the several spin models governed by boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics but its application also includes models with spin - flip based on generalized statistics @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "graphs of @xmath90 against @xmath91 lay on the same straight line for different lattice sizes , without any re - scaling in time , yielding more precise estimates for @xmath92 .",
    "although it seems clear from eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) , it is worth to stress here that two independent runs are necessary in order to calculate the ratio @xmath93 : in one of them @xmath94 , while in the other one @xmath75 .",
    "equations ( [ correlation]),([initial slip ] ) , and ( [ z ] ) solve the problem in determining the dynamic critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "but the ability of short - time monte carlo simulations goes beyond the evaluation of dynamic critical exponents , in the sense that this technique also allows us to obtain the static critical exponents which will be discussed in sequence .",
    "starting from @xmath75 , we have the expected power law described by eq.(decay_ferro ) , so considering @xmath95 , we must expect @xmath96which is obtained by differentiating the quantity @xmath95 in relation to reduced temperature @xmath97 .",
    "when dealing with monte carlo simulations , the partial derivative is approximated in first order by the difference @xmath98",
    "\\label{aproximation}\\]]where @xmath99 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ aproximation ] ) above that two independent simulations are necessary to obtain the exponent @xmath100 : one of them evolves at the temperature @xmath101 , whereas the other one evolves at @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , with @xmath103 estimated from eq.([z ] ) we obtain the estimated @xmath104 according to @xmath105 obtained from eq.([derivative ] ) , by calculating the product:@xmath106 ^{-1}\\]]where the uncertainty in @xmath104 is calculated through uncertainty of @xmath1 ( @xmath107 ) and the uncertainty of @xmath105 ( @xmath108 ) , previously obtained by statistics over @xmath109 different seeds , according to the error propagation equation @xmath110    finally , in order to obtain an estimate @xmath111 , we firstly estimate @xmath112 obtained from the magnetization decay ( [ decay_ferro ] ) and after we perform the product @xmath113 ^{-1}\\]]and the propagated error is directly calculated as a function of the respective uncertainties:@xmath114    here , it is important to mention that the ratio @xmath115 already should have been previously calculated by the evaluated @xmath112 from eq.([decay_ferro ] ) and @xmath103 from eq.([z ] ) such that:@xmath116    not only quantities related to the moments of the magnetization can explain the non - equilibrium aspects of phase transitions and critical phenomena , but also those related to the first passage time probabilities and variations of this topic ( see e.g @xcite,@xcite ) . by considering this approach and under the same nonequilibrium conditions ,",
    "a new exponent was initially proposed by @xcite : the global persistence exponent @xmath117 .",
    "it is related to the probability @xmath5 that the global order parameter has not changed sign up to time @xmath6 after a quench to @xmath29 , according to expected power law behavior@xmath118as argued by majumdar _",
    "@xcite , if the dynamics of the global order parameter is described by a markovian process , @xmath119 is not a new independent exponent and it can be related to other critical exponents , @xmath120where @xmath121 is the autocorrelation exponent in the expected power law @xcite : @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the value of the spin variable @xmath124 at the site @xmath125 of a d - dimensional system of linear size l , assumed , at instant @xmath6 , @xmath1 is the dynamic critical exponent defined as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are time and spatial correlation lengths , respectively .",
    "however , the time evolution of the order parameter is , in general , a non - markovian process and @xmath119 turns out to be a new independent critical exponent describing the evolving of the stochastic dynamic process toward the equilibrium .    in order to evaluate the persistence probability @xmath5 , we first define @xmath129 as the fraction of runs for which the magnetization changes its sign for the first time at the instant @xmath6 .",
    "our probability @xmath5 is numerically calculated from the cumulative distribution function of such @xmath129 .",
    "so , @xmath5 describes the probability of magnetization does not cross the origin up to time @xmath6 , @xmath130we start our simulations with a random initial condition , where @xmath131 .",
    "here it is important to mention that such a concept is very versatile and it has been applied to characterize several applications such as tricritical points @xcite , besides interdisciplinary applications such as : analysis of bankruptcies of players in public goods games @xcite , econophysics @xcite and many others . so it can also be interesting , for example , to study lifshitz points in spin models .",
    "the target of this paper is to enlarge our knowledge of the of the annni model , by studying the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase - transition with special attention to the lifshitz point ( lp ) .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section ( [ mcsimulations ] ) we give more details about numerical simulations that will be performed at the lifshitz point .",
    "moreover , we describe a simple method recently developed by r. da silva et al . in @xcite  that refines the critical parameters based on the best determination coefficient in linear fit @xmath132 versus @xmath133 . in this same section",
    "we present a first part of our results , where we explicitly show the refinement of critical temperatures of second order line ( ferromagnetic - paramagnetic ) up to the lifshitz point .",
    "finally in section ( [ results ] ) we present our estimates for the critical exponents and in this case we divide our results in two branches : in the branch ( a ) , we evaluate critical exponents ( only @xmath1 and @xmath115 ) for each temperature estimated along critical line previously estimated by the refinement process . in these first calculations ,",
    "the aim is only the monitoring of the behavior of these two exponents ( one dynamic and the other static ) to show the pronounced difference between ising - like points and the lifshitz point . in the second branch ( b ) of this same section",
    "we present the complete results and studies for both dynamic ( @xmath3 , @xmath119 , and @xmath1 ) and static ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) critical exponents specifically for the lifshitz point , comparing the later with results obtained in previous experimental and theoretical works .",

    "here we address time dependent mc simulations in the context of so - called short time dynamics . before evaluation of some critical exponents and the complete study of the lifshitz point ( next section ) ,",
    "also in this section we apply the refinement method to estimate the critical parameters of several points along second order line including the lifshitz point itself .",
    "the algorithm to estimate the critical temperature is divided in two stages : i ) a coarse grained location ; ii ) fine scale refinement . in stage",
    "i ) , since the magnetization must behave as a power law @xmath143 , by fixing a specific @xmath144-value , we conjecture that changing @xmath145 from @xmath146 up to @xmath147 , the corresponding best @xmath148 is the one that leads to the best linear behavior of @xmath132 versus @xmath91",

    "these extreme values were extracted from the literature , since they correspond to best known estimates for the 3d ising model ( @xmath156 which corresponds to @xmath157 ) and lp ( @xmath158 which corresponds to @xmath159 ) respectively . just as a safeguard",
    ", we enlarge this interval , by performing @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "so , for each input @xmath144-value , by using @xmath162 , we span our temperatures on a range described by parametrization @xmath163 @xmath164 , @xmath165 , so for each temperature , a linear fit is performed and one calculates the determination coefficient of the fit as : @xmath166with @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the number of monte carlo sweeps . in our experiments ,",
    "we have used @xmath169 mc steps , discarding the initial @xmath170 mcsteps for more robust estimates .",
    "hence , @xmath171 means an exact fit , and so the closer @xmath172 is from the unity , the better is the fit . here , @xmath173 and @xmath33 are the linear coefficient and the slope in the linear fit @xmath132 versus @xmath91 , respectively . from @xmath33 , one estimates the exponent @xmath174 .",
    "after , one finishes this part of our refinement method ( i ) , we pass to the second part of refinement , the fine scale stage ( ii ) . starting from the critical temperature @xmath175 obtained in the first stage",
    ", we use the process considering a more refined displacement , i.e. , @xmath176 .",

    "we can observe that @xmath197 is universal when @xmath20 is small , i.e. , the interaction among second neighbors in @xmath1 direction is not pronounced resulting in @xmath198 which is exactly expected for universality class of 3d ising .",
    "however , in the neighborhood of the lifshitz point , the exponent @xmath1 has a sensitive increase resulting in @xmath199 .",

    "<S> in this work , we study the critical behavior of second order points and specifically of the lifshitz point ( lp ) of a three - dimensional ising model with axial competing interactions ( annni model ) , using time - dependent monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we used a recently developed technique that helps us localize the critical temperature corresponding to the best power law for magnetization decay over time : @xmath0 which is expected of simulations starting from initially ordered states . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we obtain original results for the dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 , evaluated from the behavior of the ratio @xmath2 , along the critical line up to the lp . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explore all the critical exponents of the lp in detail , including the dynamic critical exponent @xmath3 that characterizes the initial slip of magnetization and the global persistence exponent @xmath4 associated to the probability @xmath5 that magnetization keeps its signal up to time @xmath6 . our estimates for the dynamic critical exponents at the lifshitz point are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , values very different from the 3d ising model ( annni model without the next - nearest - neighbor interactions at @xmath1-axis , i.e. , @xmath9 ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we also present estimates for the static critical exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 , obtained from extended time - dependent scaling relations . </S>",
    "<S> our results for static exponents are in good agreement with previous works </S>"
