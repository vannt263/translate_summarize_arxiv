    "flavor mixing in the quarks , in the standard model , arises from the unitary mixing matrices which diagonalize the corresponding mass matrices . in the quark sector",

    "one can also work in a basis in which the up - quark ( down - quark ) mass matrix @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is diagonal . in these bases",
    "the mixing matrix in the quark sector ( like in the neutrino sector ) will come from a single mass matrix . clearly , if we knew the mass matrices fully then the corresponding mixing matrices are completely determined . in practice ,",

    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 provide a simple criterion for selecting suitable mass matrices . in particular , the latter is remarkable in that it shows that if @xmath26 is real for a given @xmath8 , then the jarlskog invariant for the matrix @xmath7 which diagonalizes it vanishes .",
    "we consider    @xmath28    for @xmath29 this reduces to the so called fritzsch type mass matrix  @xcite and will give @xmath30 .",
