    "compute - and - forward ( cmf ) method , proposed by nazer and gastpar  @xcite , is an innovative approach for efficient communications over multi - user relay networks . here , instead of recovering single messages ,",
    "the relays attempt to reliably decode ( compute ) and pass an integer linear combination of the transmitted messages , referred to as an equation , to the destination . by receiving sufficient equations and their corresponding equation coefficients vectors ( ecvs ) ,",
    "the destination can solve the linear equation system to recover the desired messages .",
    "the cmf method enables exploiting , rather than combating , the multiple access interference in a wireless relay network , and thus results in improved network throughput  @xcite .",
    "a `` cmf method '' designed for a multi - user multi - relay network consists of two main parts , namely , `` computing scheme '' and `` forwarding strategy '' . computing scheme is the structure that is used in each relay to find ecvs and to compute the desired equations from the received signals by the relays . on the other hand ,",
    "forwarding strategy determines the plan of exchanging information over the network , e.g. how to transmit decoded equations by the relays to the destination , and how to recover the desired messages at the destination .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     [ tb : compare ]    the first developed computing scheme is introduced in  @xcite , called standard computing ( std - cm ) scheme , in which each single - antenna relay , independently of the other relays , decodes only one equation with the highest possible rate .",
    "this leads to an integer optimization problem in each relay to find the integer ecv of its equation . in std - cm scheme , the local channel state information ( csi ) should be known by the relay . following  @xcite ,",
    "different computing schemes have been suggested in the literature that can be employed as a part of the cmf methods over multi - user multi - relay networks , e.g. ,  @xcite . in  @xcite , and  @xcite , the std - cm scheme is used for different network structures . in  @xcite ,",
    "the std - cm scheme is generalized to the case of multiple - antenna users and relays . in  @xcite , to reduce the optimization complexity , the authors propose the simplified version of std - cm scheme that limits the integer ecvs to be selected from a predetermined set . in  @xcite , a blind computing scheme is introduced that , as opposed to other referred works , requires no csi at the relays , at the cost of being sub - optimal . in  @xcite",
    ", a computing scheme is designed to address the timing asynchronism in cmf methods .",
    "the multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) detection scheme suggested in  @xcite , called integer - forcing linear receiver ( iflr ) , simultaneously recovers multiple ecvs and can be employed as a computing scheme by a multi - antenna relay . in the scheme utilized by  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "each relay finds a number of not - necessarily independent integer ecvs with the highest computation rates .",
    "the performance of computing schemes can be improved by utilizing the previously decoded equations in decoding the subsequent equations  @xcite .",
    "the idea follows the same intuition as in successive interference cancellation ( sic ) used in multi - user receivers  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 7 ) and is partially studied in several works  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "sic is implemented in a single - antenna relay for recovering two equations . in  @xcite ,",
    "a variant of iflr scheme is proposed based on sic . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors modify the iflr scheme to take advantage of the remaining correlations among noises at the equalizer s output via noise - prediction , and improve the detection performance . in this approach",
    ", the receiver uses previous equations at each step , to reduce the effective noise in subsequent recovering steps .",
    "this modified scheme , called successive integer - forcing , is a generalized form of the schemes in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the first forwarding strategy , for cmf method , is the one employed in original cmf method  @xcite , called standard forwarding ( std - fw ) strategy . with the std - fw ,",
    "all @xmath0 relays send in turn their decoded equations to the destination .",
    "the std - fw strategy is also employed in  @xcite and  @xcite . in  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "a cooperative forwarding strategy is proposed to find linearly independent ecvs with highest possible rates .",
    "a centralized forwarding strategy is exploited in  @xcite , where all relays send their ecvs along with their corresponding rates to the destination and the destination selects the relays with the highest computation rates that have linearly independent ecvs .",
    "one of the main challenges for cmf methods is the rank failure problem , in which the received equations by the destination may be linearly dependent , and hence the destination can not recover its desired messages .",
    "this problem deteriorates the performance of cmf methods considerably and leads to a low order of diversity  @xcite . to decrease the probability of rank failure problem ,",
    "@xcite imposes a constraint on the selected integer ecvs in each relay , and  @xcite employs large number of relays .",
    "also ,  @xcite , suggest cooperation among relays or using a centralized coordinator .",
    "although cooperative and centralized approaches decrease the probability of rank failure significantly , they require additional signaling overhead , feedback channels , or global csi  @xcite . assuming global csi at the users ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite design transmit precoders for the users , to reduce the probability of selecting dependent equations by the relays . however , none of the mentioned methods remove the rank failure problem completely within the practical constraints of the system .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel forwarding strategy , referred to as selection forwarding ( sel - fw ) strategy , to combat the rank failure problem .",
    "this strategy can be used for arbitrary number of relays / users , and , in combination with a proper computing scheme , solves the rank failure problem .",
    "the sel - fw strategy needs the minimum number of orthogonal relay - to - destination ( r - d ) channels ( see section  [ subsec : sel - fw ] for details ) .",
    "also , the proposed sel - fw strategy requires negligible signaling overhead or feedback channels . as a proper computing scheme for sel - fw strategy",
    ", we extend the std - cm scheme to decode multiple linearly independent equations in each relay .",
    "we refer to this technique as extended computing ( ext - cm ) . moreover , to increase the computation rates of the equations at relays , we exploit the sic idea in ext - cm scheme , and develop the successive computing ( suc - cm ) scheme . employing the suc - cm scheme leads to enhanced performance compared to the ext - cm scheme .    considering the combinations of the sel - fw strategy with the ext - cm or suc - cm schemes , we propose two novel cmf methods .",
    "first , we introduce the extended cmf method , which is the sel - fw strategy in combination with the ext - cm scheme .",
    "second , we propose the successive cmf method that utilizes the sel - fw strategy along with the suc - cm scheme . moreover , we consider the generalized version of the original cmf method  @xcite with multiple - antenna relays as the benchmark approach .",
    "the original cmf method consists of the std - fw strategy and the std - cm scheme ( see table  [ tb : compare ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "the main contributions of our work , compared to the state - of - the - art schemes , can be outlined as :    1 .",
    "we propose two novel cmf methods for the multi - user multi - relay networks , namely , extended cmf and successive cmf methods , with arbitrary number of users / relays and relay antennas .",
    "as opposed to aforementioned cmf methods , our proposed methods solve the rank failure problem , use the minimum required number of orthogonal r - d channels , impose negligible signaling overhead or feedback channels to the network , and each relay requires only local csi .",
    "all these are gained at the cost of added complexity , compared to the original cmf method , due to finding larger number of ecvs at the relays .",
    "our paper is different from  @xcite because , first , we exploit the suc - cm scheme in a multi - user multi - relay network .",
    "second , we derive concise formulations ( equations  ( [ eq : bk_opt])-([eq : q_k ] ) ) and explicit framework ( in section  [ subsec : suc - cm ] ) for the suc - cm scheme for general setups with different number of users / relay antennas .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a novel approach to significantly facilitate the solution of the integer optimization problem in the suc - cm scheme ( see theorem  [ th : opt_sic ] ) .",
    "we provide theoretical diversity analysis for our proposed methods in the cases with different r - d channels ( theorems  [ th : d - ideal ] , [ th : d - nf ] , and  [ th : d - wf ] ) .",
    "none of the derived analyses have been presented before .",
    "4 .   as opposed to  @xcite , which is sensitive to channel estimation error ( cee )  @xcite , we show , through numerical simulations , that the successive cmf is significantly robust against the cee .",
    "this makes the successive cmf a proper method for practical applications .",
    "our diversity analysis and numerical simulations indicate that extended cmf and successive cmf methods achieve full diversity , i.e. the maximum possible diversity order , of the multi - user multi - relay network , provided that the r - d channels have a certain minimum quality .",
    "furthermore , we show that the successive cmf method provides signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) gains and high robustness against cee , compared to the extended cmf method , while has more complex structure .",
    "both methods outperform the original cmf method considerably .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , the system model is introduced .",
    "the forwarding strategies and computing schemes are presented in section  [ sec : dest ] and  [ sec : relay ] , respectively .",
    "closed - form equations and modified optimization problem for the successive case are given in section  [ sec : relay ] , as well .",

    "the notation @xmath6 indicates the linear independency of vector @xmath7 and the set of vectors @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath9 is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a network , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] , consisting of @xmath11 users , as the message sources , @xmath0 multi - antenna relays , and one common destination as the information sink .",
    "the users and the destination exploit a single antenna .",
    "each relay is equipped with @xmath12 receive antennas .",
    "the network aims to reliably convey all messages from the sources to the destination with the highest possible rate .",
    "we assume that there is no direct link between the sources and the destination .    the real channel coefficient from source @xmath13 , to antenna @xmath14 , of the relay @xmath15 , is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath0 channels from relays to the destination are orthogonal point - to - point channels .",
    "we consider two cases of ideal and non - ideal r - d channels . in the ideal case ,",
    "the r - d channels are noiseless with sufficient capacity to transfer the required information without errors . for the non - ideal case , each r - d channel has the real coefficient @xmath17 , and independent zero - mean additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with variance @xmath18 .",
    "the relays are supposed to have the same power constraint @xmath19 .",
    "we define the channel coefficient matrix @xmath20 , corresponding to @xmath21 mimo channel from users to relay @xmath22 , as @xmath23 , m=1,\\ldots , m,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the channel coefficient vector corresponding to the links between different users and the @xmath25-th antenna of the relay @xmath22 , as @xmath26^{{t } } } , n=1,\\ldots , n.\\ ] ]    our system structure is based on the standard cmf , proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the user @xmath13 , exploits a lattice encoder to map its corresponding message @xmath27 to a real symbol @xmath28 of length @xmath29 , which is a lattice point with @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the power constraint of user @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the user @xmath31 transmits the symbol @xmath33 over the channel .",
    "each transmission frame consists of two phases . in the first phase ,",
    "all users transmit their symbols simultaneously to the relays .",
    "hence , the received signal at @xmath25-th antenna of relay @xmath22 can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the zero - mean additive white gaussian noise vector with variance @xmath36 . in the second phase ,",
    "the relays send their information through the orthogonal point - to - point channels ( e.g. consecutive time slots ) to the destination .",
    "as it is well - known , a channel coefficient in heavily built - up urban environments can be modeled as a zero - mean circularly - symmetric complex gaussian random variable that results in rayleigh and uniform distributions for gain and phase components of the channel , respectively  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) . since in most scenarios ( e.g. simple point - to - point channels ) , the phase can be compensated , the channel coefficients can be modeled as real rayleigh variables . however , since in cmf , all users transmit simultaneously and each relay receives a linear combination of the transmitted signals , the channels phases can not be compensated . therefore , for the real case , i.e. when the transmitted signals are real , each relay can exploit the in - phase or quadrature component of its received signals .",
    "hence , the effective channel is equal to the real or imaginary part of the complex channel , which can be modeled as a real zero - mean gaussian random variable .",
    "the case in which each relay employs both the in - phase and quadrature components of its received signals , to achieve an improved performance , is equivalent to a relay that uses only one of the signals components and has twice the number of receive antennas .    for the complex case ,",
    "each user sends two different messages over real and imaginary parts of the channels and each relay exploits both the in - phase and quadrature components of its received signals . for this case , in  @xcite it is shown that by real - valued decomposition of the complex channel matrix , the complex @xmath37 mimo channel between each user and each relay can equivalently be modeled as a real @xmath38 mimo channel . note that the snr is the same for the real and complex models  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to cover all discussed cases , we assume that each relay considers only the in - phase components of its received signals . hence , a real zero - mean gaussian distribution with unit variance is considered for the channel @xmath16 for all values of @xmath31 , @xmath22 , and @xmath25 .",
    "note that our assumptions are in harmony with  @xcite and  @xcite , and the same procedure as in the paper is applicable in the cases with complex distributions .    for the case of non - ideal r - d channels ,",
    "since we consider orthogonal point - to - point channels , the channel noises can be compensated , and hence the assumption of real channels is applicable . to cover different r - d channel conditions , we consider the nakagami distribution with the parameter  @xmath39 for the channels coefficients .",
    "the fading severity decreases with @xmath39 .",
    "rayleigh and awgn channels are the special cases of the nakagami channel corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the case of ideal r - d channels is equal to noiseless nakagami channels with @xmath41 . from  @xcite ,",
    "a @xmath42 mimo channel with nakagami distributed channel coefficients and parameter @xmath39 can be modeled by a siso channel with nakagami distribution and parameter @xmath43 .",
    "hence , without loss of generality , we consider a single channel coefficient @xmath44 for each r - d channel that follows the independent real nakagami distribution with parameter @xmath45 and unit variance .",
    "furthermore , we assume block - fading conditions where the channel coefficients are constant during each transmission frame and independent of the ones in the other transmission frames .",
    "relay @xmath15 , receives @xmath12 signals @xmath46 , as expressed in  ( [ eq : yn_m ] ) , in the first transmission phase . by exploiting its @xmath12 received signals",
    ", the relay aims to compute an equation .",
    "an equation @xmath47 is a linear combination of the users symbols @xmath48 , with integer coefficients , as : @xmath49 where @xmath50^{{t } } } \\in { \\mathbb{z}^l}$ ] is referred to as the equation coefficient vector ( ecv ) corresponding to equation @xmath47 .",
    "the rate of decoding an equation is called computation rate .",
    "note that a set of equations are called linearly independent if and only if their corresponding ecvs ( equation coefficients vectors ) are linearly independent .",
    "moreover , the rate of recovering a message ( or an equation ) from a set of equations is equal to the minimum computation rate of the equations that are used in its recovery .",
    "the forwarding strategy is an important part of the cmf methods that determines how the information , including selected ecvs , decoded equations , and cooperation and feedback signals , flows over the network . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the forwarding strategies .",
    "std - fw is the forwarding strategy of the original cmf method  @xcite .",
    "however , as original cmf is used as a benchmark for comparisons of our proposed methods , it is described here . in the original cmf method ,",
    "each relay decodes the best equation , i.e. the equation with the highest computation rate , based on its received signals ( see section  [ subsec : relay : stdcmf ] ) . in the second transmission phase",
    ", each relay sends its decoded equation to the destination in its dedicated channel .",
    "hence , the destination receives @xmath0 equations from the relays .",
    "the destination , selects @xmath11 linearly independent equations , with the highest computation rates , out of the @xmath0 received equations , and then can recover all messages .    in the original cmf method",
    "@xcite , since each relay finds its best equation statistically independently of the other relays , the equations received by the destination may be linearly dependent .",
    "if the received equations are linearly dependent , the coefficient matrix of the equations is singular and the rank failure occurs .",
    "thus , the destination can not recover all messages .",
    "rank failure problem results in significant performance degradation in original cmf method and decreases the diversity order drastically  @xcite .    in the std - fw strategy ,",
    "all @xmath0 relays send in turn their decoded equations to the destination .",
    "hence , it requires @xmath0 time - slots or orthogonal channels . in the std - fw strategy",
    ", the number of relays should be equal or greater than the number of users .",
    "our proposed forwarding strategy , i.e. sel - fw , is used in both of our extended cmf and successive cmf methods . in these methods ,",
    "each relay finds the @xmath11 best ecvs , i.e. the @xmath11 linearly independent ecvs with the highest computation rates , based on its received signals ( see section  [ sec : relay ] ) .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the minimum of the computation rates for the best ecvs of relay @xmath22 .",
    "note that from the best equations of relay @xmath22 all @xmath11 messages can be recovered with rate @xmath51 . in sel - fw strategy ,",
    "the relay with highest @xmath51 is selected .",
    "the relay selection can be performed in either of the following ways :    * each relay sends its rate @xmath51 to the destination .",
    "destination selects the highest rate and informs the selected relay through a low - rate feedback channel .",
    "the feedback rate is @xmath52 bits per relay selection interval . *",
    "similar to  @xcite , each relay sets a timer with the value @xmath53 proportional to the inverse of its rate @xmath51 .",
    "the timers start to count down at the beginning of the second transmission phase .",
    "the relay whose timer reaches zero first ( which has the highest rate ) broadcasts a flag to inform other relays and is selected as the best relay .",
    "we assume that the flag is a short - time high - energy signal that can be sensed by the other relays with a probability close to one .",
    "this approach needs no feedback channel .",
    "note that the relay selection is necessary once the channels coefficients have changed , i.e. the best relay is fixed for the coherence interval of the channels .",
    "thus , for slow fading channels , relay selection imposes negligible additional complexity and overhead to the network .    the selected relay decodes and forwards its @xmath11 best equations , corresponding to its best ecvs , to the destination through @xmath11 orthogonal channels .",
    "utilizing the @xmath11 received independent equations , the destination can solve and recover all messages , without encountering the rank failure problem .",
    "note that , since @xmath11 messages are transmitted over the network , the destinations needs at least @xmath11 equations from the relays to recover all messages .",
    "hence , the minimum number of required r - d orthogonal channels is equal to @xmath11 , that is achieved by sel - fw strategy .",
    "note that , although selecting one relay is not globally optimal for recovering @xmath11 independent equations with highest rates , it eliminates the need for information exchange among the relays , as it is required in cooperative strategies .",
    "[ re : complexity ] based on the sel - fw strategy , each of the @xmath0 relays finds @xmath11 ecvs , but only the selected relay ( with highest @xmath51 ) decodes the @xmath11 equations corresponding to its ecvs . on the other hand , in the original cmf method ,",
    "each of the @xmath0 relays selects an ecv and decodes the corresponding equation .",
    "hence , to compare the overall computational complexity , in the former , @xmath54 ecvs are selected and @xmath11 equations are decoded , while in the latter @xmath0 ecvs are selected and @xmath0 equations are decoded .",
    "the std - fw and sel - fw strategies require computing schemes that can be employed in a relay to find the best ecv or the best @xmath11 linearly independent ecvs , respectively .",
    "moreover , the technique of computing equations , corresponding to the selected ecvs , should be specified by the computing schemes .",
    "we assume that each relay knows only local csi , as in , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "all equations of the current section are written for each relay @xmath15 .",
    "hence , for simplicity of presentation , we remove the index @xmath22 from the equations .",
    "a relay receives @xmath12 signals , @xmath55 , at its antennas in the first transmission phase , as expressed in  ( [ eq : yn_m ] ) .",

    "then , the signal @xmath81 is used as the input of the relay lattice decoder to recover the desired equation @xmath82 .    the std - cm scheme presented above , is the generalized ( with multiple antenna ) version of the computing scheme of the original cmf method  @xcite and is the basis of the other presented computing schemes in this paper .",
    "ext - cm is used as the computing scheme of our extended cmf method . in our proposed forwarding strategy ,",
    "i.e. sel - fw , the relay needs to find @xmath11 independent ecvs with the highest computation rates .",

    "the other ecvs are calculated sequentially through @xmath83 where the constraint @xmath84 guarantees that the ecv @xmath85 is linearly independent of the previous ecvs @xmath86 .",
    "the above optimization can be solved by employing the same method as in  @xcite , except that the search space is over vectors independent of the previous ecvs . moreover , the approaches suggested in  @xcite can be exploited to find the solution of  ( [ eq : ak ] ) with reduced complexity .    by finding the ecvs",
    ", the relay can decode the corresponding equations . specifically , for decoding the @xmath87-th equation , it calculates the combining coefficient vector @xmath88 from  ( [ eq : b ] ) and generates the combined signal @xmath89 from  ( [ eq : ybar ] ) .",

    "hence , the sum rate of recovering all messages from these @xmath11 equations is equal to @xmath93    in ext - cm scheme , @xmath11 linearly independent equations are selected sequentially , as expressed in  ( [ eq : ak ] ) .",
    "a different approach , named iflr , is presented in  @xcite to recover multiple equations at the receiver of a point - to - point mimo channel . however , since in iflr the data streams of transmit antennas are independently coded , the scheme can be exploited in a multi - user scenario as well .",
    "the iflr scheme results in the following optimization @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes @xmath96 excluding the zero vector , @xmath97 shows the cardinality of the set @xmath98 , and @xmath99 equals the rank of the matrix whose columns are the elements of @xmath98 . comparing  ( [ eq : rsum - iflr ] ) with  ( [ eq : ak ] )",
    "reveals that in iflr scheme , all equations are selected simultaneously ( jointly ) to maximize the sum rate , as opposed to our ext - cm approach with sequential ecvs selection .",
    "the iflr scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of rates of the recovered equations  @xcite . in the following theorem",
    ", we prove that our sequential selection of ecvs , achieves the same rate as the iflr scheme , and hence , is optimal .",

    ", we propose the suc - cm scheme . in ext - cm scheme , since all @xmath11 equations are recovered from a single relay , the minimum rate of them , i.e. @xmath100 , tends to zero as @xmath11 increases . to solve this issue",
    ", we can use the previous decoded equations to improve the computation rates of the subsequent equations .    in the first step of suc - cm scheme , the first ecv @xmath79 and its corresponding equation @xmath101 are determined the same as in the std - cm and ext - cm schemes . in the @xmath87-th step , @xmath102 , the relay desires to find the @xmath87-th ecv @xmath103 and decode its corresponding equation @xmath90 .",
