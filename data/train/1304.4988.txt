    "the antiferromagnetic ( af ) ising model on a triangular lattice is one of the most fundamental models for geometrically frustrated systems .",
    "when the interaction is restricted to the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) pairs , frustration in each triangle prevents the system from forming a long - range order ( lro ) down to zero temperature , and the ground state has extensive degeneracy and associated residual entropy  @xcite .",
    "the degenerate ground state is extremely sensitive to perturbations .",
    "for instance , an infinitesimal second - neighbor interaction lifts the degeneracy and induces a lro in the ground state ; a two - sublattice stripe order [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] is selected as the ground state when the additional interaction is af , while a three - sublattice ferrimagnetic ( fr ) order [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) ] is selected for the ferromagnetic ( fm ) interaction .",
    "in such a degenerate situation , thermal fluctuations also play an interesting role . in general",
    ", there is a possibility that a high - entropic state is selected out of the ground state manifold by raising temperature this is called the order by disorder  @xcite .",
    "for the af ising model , a candidate for such an emergent state is a partially disordered ( pd ) state .",
    "the pd state is peculiar coexistence of magnetically ordered moments and thermally - fluctuating paramagnetic moments .",
    "such possibility was first discussed by the mean - field study in the presence of second - neighbor fm interaction  @xcite ; the mean - field study predicted that a three - sublattice pd phase with an af ordering on the honeycomb subnetwork and paramagnetic moments at the remaining sites [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](c ) ] was induced at finite temperature from the degenerate manifold in the limit of vanishing second - neighbor interaction .",
    "although such pd state was experimentally observed in several co compounds  @xcite and theoretically shown to present in a stacked triangular lattice model  @xcite , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in two - dimensional triangular lattice models have indicated that pd is fragile and remains at most as a quasi - lro ; namely , in most cases , the pd state is taken over by another peculiar intermediate state , the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) state  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recently , the authors have studied ising - spin kondo lattice models on a triangular lattice  @xcite and kagome lattice  @xcite by mc simulation , and showed the presence of pd state in the purely two - dimensional models . in these models",
    ", the interplay between localized moments and itinerant electrons plays a crucial role in the following points .",
    "first , the kinetic motion of electrons induces effective interactions known as the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the long - ranged and oscillating nature of the interactions drives keen competition between different magnetic states .",
    "furthermore , the change of magnetic states affects the electronic state in a self - consistent manner through the spin - charge coupling ; the system can gain the energy by forming some particular electronic state associated with magnetic ordering . in the previous study",
    ", the authors suggested that the pd state is stabilized by the non - perturbative role of itinerant electrons  @xcite .    in this contribution , we present our comprehensive numerical results on the magnetic and electronic properties of the ising - spin kondo lattice model on a triangular lattice . to further clarify the stabilization mechanism of pd",
    ", we analyze the evolution of band structure under the pd type magnetic texture on the basis of a simple mean - field argument .",
    "the analysis suggests that the spin - charge coupling can stabilize the pd state by the slater mechanism . bearing this mean - field picture in mind , we present and discuss the results of mc simulation in details .",
    "we distinguish the two intermediate - temperature states , pd and kt - like states , from the two - sublattice stripe and three - sublattice fr lro states , and identify the range of the phases by varying the electron filling and the strength of spin - charge coupling . analyzing the phase diagram and electronic states in comparison with the mean - field picture , we conclude that the two - dimensional pd state is stabilized through the slater mechanism .",

    "the pd state in our model also retains six low - energy states with different up - down - paramagnetic configurations , and hence , the transition to pd is expected to be classified in the framework of six - state models . however , from the argument of duality properties , it is prohibited that the six - state models exhibit a single second - order transition for changing temperature  @xcite . for instance , a two - dimensional six - state clock model shows two kt transitions at finite temperature , without exhibiting true lro for @xmath151  @xcite . on the other hand",

    "to summarize , by a combined analysis of the mean - field type calculation and monte carlo simulation , we have investigated the origin of the partial disorder in the ising - spin kondo lattice model in a two - dimensional triangular lattice . in the mean - field type calculation , we have clarified that a local magnetic field of the partial disorder type induces a metal - insulator transition at 1/3 filling at a critical value of the field .",

    "the monte carlo result shows that the partially disordered state appears above a nonzero value of the spin - charge coupling , and that it is insulating and accompanied by charge disproportionation .",
    "the nonzero critical value of the spin - charge coupling and the opening of the charge gap are both qualitatively consistent with the mean - field analysis .",

    "an interesting extension of the current work would be to consider the effect of quantum fluctuation of localized spins . in our result , the partial disorder remains stable down to very low temperature , implying that the paramagnetic spins are largely fluctuating and sensitive to perturbations at low temperatures .",
    "hence , an interesting possibility is that , by including quantum fluctuations , the partial disorder is further stabilized and remains stable even in the ground state . indeed , a similar partial disorder was found in the ground state of the kondo lattice model with quantum spins at half filling  @xcite .",
