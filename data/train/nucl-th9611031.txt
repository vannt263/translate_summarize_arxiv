    "an important insight from recent theoretical research on hanbury - brown  twiss ( hbt ) interferometry is that for dynamical sources which undergo collective expansion the hbt radius parameters , which characterize the width of the two - particle correlation function , develop a dependence on the pair momentum @xcite .",
    "the detailed momentum dependence is somewhat model - dependent , and in general it is not simple @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , the most abundant candidates for interferometry studies , charged pions , are strongly contaminated by decay products from unstable resonances some of which only decay long after hadron freeze - out @xcite .",
    "such resonance decays were shown to introduce an additional momentum dependence of the hbt radius parameters and of the intercept parameter @xcite which complicates the extraction of the expansion flow .",
    "a systematic approach towards extracting the expansion velocity from experimental hbt data thus presupposes a careful analysis of the interplay of flow and resonance decays on the gross features of the two - particle correlation function .",

    "we will use for our analysis a simple analytical model for the source function , which assumes local thermalization at freeze - out and produces hadronic resonances by thermal excitation .",

    "at least for the model studied here , the kurtosis provides thus the cleanest distinction between scenarios with and without transverse flow .",
    "its value and @xmath91-dependence are thus very important ingredients for the interpretation of 2-particle correlations .",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated in the outward direction : as long as the source does not expand transversally ( @xmath178 ) , the visibility of resonance decay effects in @xmath197 is clearly linked to a non - zero positive kurtosis of the correlator , and vice versa . for non - zero transverse flow , however , the outward correlator begins to develop small deviations from a gaussian @xcite even without resonance decays ; these show up in a _ negative _ value for the kurtosis .",
    "this effect increases for larger transverse pair momenta @xmath91 .",
    "the kurtosis generated by collective expansion is particularly prominent in the longitudinal direction where flow - induced non - gaussian features they have been noticed first @xcite .",
    "the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ f12 ] clearly shows the interplay of non - gaussian features induced by resonance decays ( leading to a positive kurtosis ) and longitudinal expansion flow ( causing a negative kurtosis ) . at small @xmath91",
    "the resonance contributions dominate ; at large @xmath91 the resonances loose importance while the flow - induced kurtosis becomes stronger , leading to overall negative values of the kurtosis .",
    "within a broad class of model emission functions for locally thermalized and collectively expanding sources we have presented a comprehensive study of resonance decay effects on two - pion bose - einstein correlations . we have found that , with regard to their influence on the correlation function , the resonances can be subdivided into three classes :    * _ long - lived resonances _ with width @xmath316 mev can not be resolved in the correlation measurement ; they reduce the correlation strength @xmath3 but otherwise do not influence the shape of the correlation function in the region where it can be measured . * _ short - lived resonances _ with width @xmath317 mev : they decay into pions close to their production point and thus do not change the spatial width of the pion emission function .",
    "hence they do not affect the sideward correlator whose width is defined by the transverse spatial size of the source . in the outward and longitudinal correlator and in the lifetime parameter @xmath273 of the ykp parametrization , which are all in one way or other sensitive to the lifetime of the source , they contribute via the additional time duration of pion emission due to their own lifetime .",
    "these contributions are small and on the order of the resonance lifetime . * _ the @xmath90 meson . _ with its width of about 8 mev it is not sufficiently long - lived to escape detection in the correlator , but also not sufficiently short - lived to not change the spatial width of the emission function . as a consequence it can lead to severe non - gaussian distortions of the correlator .",
    "these latter distortions cause serious problems .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] that both the method of extracting width parameters from the correlator via gaussian fits and the calculation of these parameters in terms of space - time variances can lead to quantitatively unreliable results .",

    ". for sufficiently high statistics data , hbt radius parameters determined in this way are free of systematic uncertainties .",
    "for the examples studied here , they show a much weaker influence from resonance decays than we had expected on the basis of previous work @xcite .",
    "the normalized fourth order @xmath1-cumulant ( kurtosis ) serves as a quantitative lowest - order measure for the non - gaussian features of the correlator .",
    "it is sensitive to both resonance decays and flow which ( at least for the models studied here ) contribute , however , with different signs .",
    "the kurtosis thus provides the cleanest signal to distinguish between scenarios with and without transverse flow .",
    "our detailed numerical model study of @xmath1-moments has shown that resonance decays which modify the hbt radius parameters ( defined via the @xmath1-variance of the correlator ) also lead to a positive kurtosis .",
    "it can be related to the long non - gaussian tails in the source distribution generated by the decay pions .",
    "collective expansion , on the other hand , generates a negative kurtosis because it tends ( in our model ) to let the source at its edges decay more steeply than a gaussian .",
    "we see practically no flow effects on the kurtosis in the sideward direction , a weak effect due to transverse expansion in the outward direction , and a somewhat larger effect due to the strong longitudinal expansion in the longitudinal direction . in the transverse direction resonance effects on the hbt radius @xmath228",
    "can thus be directly correlated with a non - zero , positive kurtosis . the existence or not of a non - vanishing kurtosis @xmath318 and its @xmath91-dependence",
    "can thus be used to assess the amount of contamination in @xmath228 from @xmath90-decays and to separate these effects from transverse flow .",

    "<S> we study the effect of resonance decays on intensity interferometry for heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> collective expansion of the source leads to a dependence of the two - particle correlation function on the pair momentum @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the possibility to reconstruct the dynamics of the source from the @xmath0-dependence of the measured `` hbt radii '' . </S>",
    "<S> here we address the question to what extent resonance decays can fake such a flow signal . within a simple parametrization for the emission function we present a comprehensive analysis of the interplay of flow and resonance decays on the one- and two - particle spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the non - gaussian features of the correlation function introduced by long - lived resonances and the resulting problems in extracting meaningful hbt radii . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to define them in terms of the second order @xmath1-moments of the correlator @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this yields a more reliable characterisation of the correlator in terms of its width and the correlation strength @xmath3 than other commonly used fit procedures . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized fourth - order @xmath1-moments ( kurtosis ) provide a quantitative measure for the non - gaussian features of the correlator . at least for the class of models studied here , the kurtosis helps separating effects from expansion flow and resonance decays , and provides the cleanest signal to distinguish between scenarios with and without transverse flow . </S>"
