    "in this paper we shall study quantized , linear perturbations of the gravitational field of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "since this represents a study of the one - loop approximation to a theory of quantum gravity , it should provide useful insights into what the full theory should look like .",
    "in addition , there is a growing body of evidence which suggests that the influence of non - conformally invariant quantum fields , foremost of which is linearized gravity , strongly dominates that of conformally invariant quantum fields in the neighborhood of a space - time singularity . for example it has been shown recently@xcite that the value of the renormalized energy density for the graviton field in the vicinity of a conical singularity in an otherwise flat space - time ( the idealized cosmic string ) is roughly ten times that for the electromagnetic field and one hundred times that for the conformally coupled scalar field .",
    "a knowledge of how gravitons behave near the singularity at the center of a black hole is therefore also likely to be crucial to our understanding of quantum gravity .",
    "the classical theory of linearized perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole was developped by regge and wheeler,@xcite zerilli@xcite and others . here",
    "we follow the approach of teukolsky,@xcite who gave a complete set of solutions to the perturbation equations for a kerr black hole within the newman - penrose formalism . in this formalism",
    "the system is described by two quantities  the perturbed weyl scalars @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( here and in the following , a dot indicates a linearly perturbed quantity ) .",
    "these are the field variables of interest describing the semi - classical theory , since    \\(a ) they carry in their real and imaginary parts information on all the dynamical degrees of freedom of the perturbed field ;    \\(b ) they are invariant under both gauge transformations and infinitesimal tetrad transformations which leave the metric perturbation intact,@xcite as befits a physical quantity ;    \\(c ) they are simply expressed ( albeit in a particular gauge ) in terms of the metric perturbation which provides the most direct route to quantization;@xcite and    \\(d ) they directly measure the energy flux of classical perturbations of the black hole across the horizon and at infinity.@xcite    in this work our main concern will be to extend the work of candelas _",
    "et al._,@xcite by first presenting formulae for the expectation values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with respect to the three physically relevant quantum states for the schwarzschild black hole , namely the boulware , unruh and hartle - hawking states , and then evaluating these expressions numerically .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath3 are quadratic in the field variables their expectation values will be infinite ; however differences between the expectation values of either @xmath2 or @xmath3 with respect to the various quantum states mentioned above are finite and these differences are the objects which we will calculate .",
    "( indeed , some would argue that such differences are more likely to be of physical significance than the results obtained from renormalization procedures . ) in the process of achieving these main goals we also fill several gaps in the literature concerning quantized perturbations of black holes ; in particular we present both low - frequency analytic formulae and a set of wronskian relations for the reflection and transmission coefficients associated with the theory .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows : the two sections immediately following this introduction summarize the essentials of what is already known about the classical and semi - classical theories of linear perturbations of black holes .",

    "the question of orthonormality of the mode set is rigorously addressed , the perturbations are quantized and expressions for differences between the expectation values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the boulware , unruh and hartle - hawking states are presented in terms of the radial functions .    in sec .",
    "[ powerseries ] we prepare the expressions obtained for the various expectation values for numerical evaluation .",
    "the first step is to derive a power series representation for the general solution to the radial equation ; the particular radial solutions occuring in the expectation values may then be substituted for these power series , weighted by appropriate constants called reflection and transmission amplitudes by virtue of the analogy with classical scattering .    before the differences between the expectation values can be evaluated numerically , the reflection and transmission amplitudes must be determined explicitly .",
    "this is achieved in sec .",
    "[ powerseries ] by comparing the power series representations for the particular radial solutions at large values of the radial coordinate with their known asymptotic forms .",
    "graphs are presented for these amplitudes against frequency and angular number , and the results are checked for both internal and external consistency ; the former by means of wronskian relations derived between the coefficients in appendix [ relations ] and analytic formulae for the amplitudes valid at low frequencies derived in appendix [ smallomegaapp ] ; the latter by reproducing pages@xcite results for the luminosity due to graviton emission from the black hole .    in sec .",
