    "the first evidence for an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch was presented in the late 1990s by riess et al .",
    "@xcite and perlmutter et al .",
    "@xcite . fitting a cosmological model including a cosmological constant matched the supernovae type ia of the considered data sets significantly better than a model without such a constant . in the following years , a lot of effort was put into getting larger supernova ( sn ) sets of increasing quality @xcite . on the other hand , a variety of cosmological models",
    "have been developed that could be fit to the newest data sets .",
    "those models are characterized by certain parameters which are used to derive a redshift - luminosity relation that can be compared to the observed values .",
    "the problem with this so - called dynamical approach is that it is impossible to test without assumptions on the matter and energy content of the universe if there really is a phase of acceleration in the expansion history of the universe .",
    "some authors tried to avoid this problem by taking a kinematical approach , i.e. they only considered the scale factor @xmath1 and its derivatives , such as the deceleration parameter @xmath2 , without using any model specific density parameters or a dark energy equation of state .",
    "the first kinematical analysis of sn data was done by turner and riess @xcite who considered averaged values @xmath3 for redshift @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 concluding that a present acceleration and a past deceleration is favoured by the data .",
    "other authors tested a variety of special parameterizations of @xmath2 @xcite or used @xmath7 @xcite or the hubble rate @xmath8 @xcite . instead of considering a special parameterization ,",
    "a more general approach has been done by shapiro and turner @xcite who expanded the deceleration parameter @xmath9 into principal components .",
    "rapetti et al .",
    "@xcite expanded the jerk parameter @xmath10 into a series of orthonormal functions .",
    "however , one has to be careful when doing a series expansion in @xmath11 as sne with a redshift larger than 1 are not within the radius of convergence .",
    "this problem can be solved by reparameterizing redshift @xcite .    in the present work we will neither make any assumptions about the content of the universe , nor about the parameterization of @xmath2 or another kinematical quantity .",
    "moreover , we do not need to assume the validity of einstein s equations .",
    "instead , we will only ask the question if the hypothesis holds that the universe never expanded accelerated between the time when the light was emitted from a sn and today .",
    "our assumption for the test is that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "this is certainly not true for the real universe in a strict sense .",
    "however , we follow the standard approach in assuming that the cosmic structure does not modify the observed sn magnitudes and redshifts apart from random peculiar motion .",
    "the basic idea of this analysis has already been presented by visser @xcite and has been applied to sn data by different groups @xcite .",
    "but while santos et al .",
    "@xcite made some mistakes in their analysis ( that we will discuss later in section [ concl ] ) and gong et al .",
    "@xcite only state that accelerated expansion is `` evident '' , we are able to give a quantitative value for this evidence",
    ". additionally , we study the size of systematic effects",
    ".    for the fit one usually marginalizes over a function of the absolute magnitude @xmath12 and the hubble constant @xmath13 because these two values can not be determined independently by only considering sne .",
    "marginalization is not suitable for our analysis because in order to do so a special cosmological model or at least a parametization of @xmath2 has to be inserted , which is what we want to avoid .",
    "but the sne can be calibrated by cepheid meassurements and thus the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are determined . using this additional information ,",
    "no marginalization is needed .",
    "as there is still a controversy @xcite about the appropriate calibration method , we will take two quite different results of calibration into account @xcite .    in order to test the robustness of our analysis ,",
    "we consider two different sn data sets ( the 2007 gold sample @xcite and the essence set @xcite ) , where the data of the essence set are once obtained by the multicolour light - curve shape ( mlcs2k2 ) @xcite fitting method and once by the spectral adaptive light - curve template ( salt ) @xcite .",
    "both calibration methods are applied to each set .",
    "the analysis shows that in all cases the data indicate an accelerated expansion .",
    "but the confidence level at which acceleration can be stated strongly depends on the data set , the fitting method and the calibration .",
    "we begin our analysis by assuming a flat universe , but later also consider the cases of an open and a closed universe .",
    "we want to keep our test as model - independent as possible , but still a few assumptions have to be made .",
    "we consider inflationary cosmology to be correct .",
    "this implies large scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe as well as spatial flatness .",
    "( yet , we will give up the assumption of a flat universe later in section [ openclosed ] . )",
    "we also assume that cosmological averaging ( here along the line of sight ) does not modify the result obtained in a friedmann - lematre model .",
    "in such a universe , the luminosity distance @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 as we are interested in the question whether the universe accelerates or decelerates at the present epoch , we need to examine the deceleration parameter @xmath2 : if @xmath9 is positive , the universe expands decelerated , for a negative @xmath9 it accelerates .",
    "@xmath2 can be expressed in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath8 : @xmath16 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath11 . integrating this equation yields @xmath17",
    "our null hypothesis is that the universe never expanded accelerated , i.e. @xmath18 for all @xmath11 . under this assumption",
    ", the above equation turns into the inequality @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "thus , for the luminosity distance we have @xmath21    in order to test our hypothesis , we consider different data sets of sne type ia .",
    "if the observed luminosity distance is significantly larger than the luminosity distance of a universe with a constant @xmath22 , the hypothesis can be rejected at a high confidence level .",
    "note that the rejection of the hypothesis does not mean that there was no deceleration between the time the light was emitted from a sn until now , it only gives evidence that there was at some time a phase of acceleration .",
    "thus , we can not determine the transition redshift between deceleration and acceleration .",
    "this restriction to our analysis comes from the integral over redshift in the calculation of @xmath14 .    as a first step ,",
    "the data in the considered sets have to be calibrated consistently .",
    "the distance modulus @xmath23 is related to the luminosity distance by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is given in units of mpc .",
    "the distance modulus of the sne ia in those sets is always given in arbitrary units because the absolute magnitude @xmath12 can not be measured independently of the hubble constant @xmath13 . only the apparent magnitude @xmath26 and thus the relative distance moduli are measured at high precision . in order to determine the absolute magnitude , the sne have to be calibrated by measuring the distance of cepheids in the host galaxies . then also the hubble constant can be determined .",
    "but there is still disagreement between different groups about the correct calibration analysis . in this work",
    "we will consider two results for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , namely that of riess et al .",
    "@xcite and that of sandage et al .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we will refer to those results as riess calibration and sandage calibration , respectively .",
    "the difference in the calibration comes mainly from the different assumptions on the evolution of the cepheid period - luminosity relation with host metallicity @xcite .",
    "so for preparing the data for our analysis , first the distance moduli @xmath27 have to be adjusted to the assumed absolute magnitude .",
    "we define the magnitude @xmath28 as the observed distance modulus @xmath27 of the @xmath29-th sn minus the distance modulus in a universe with constant deceleration parameter @xmath22 at the same redshift @xmath30 : @xmath31 -25 \\,.\\ ] ] if the error in redshift and the peculiar velocities of the sne are already included in the error @xmath32 given in a certain data set , then the error @xmath33 of @xmath28 equals @xmath32 .",
    "otherwise , the resulting error of @xmath28 is calculated by : @xmath34^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\,.\\ ] ]    let @xmath35 be the theoretical distance modulus of a cosmological model , which describes the expansion of the universe correctly",
    ". then @xmath36 would be the `` true '' value corresponding to the meassured sn value @xmath28 .",
    "the null hypothesis for our test is that the universe never expanded accelerated , i.e. @xmath37 for each sn .",
    "we reject that hypothesis if the measured value @xmath28 lies above a certain action limit @xmath38 , otherwise we accept it",
    ". we want to keep the risk low that we conclude a late time acceleration of the universe , when there is indeed no acceleration at all .",
    "therefore the action limit must be relatively high .",
    "if we want the confidence level for concluding an accelerated expansion to be 99% , the action limit must be @xmath39 .",
    "for a confidence level of 95% , the limit is @xmath40 .",
    "here we assume that the measured values @xmath28 at a given redshift follow a normal distribution .    on the other hand , we can test the hypothesis that the universe expanded accelerated all the time from light emission of a sn until today . this hypothesis can be rejected at a 99% cl if @xmath28 is below the action limit @xmath41 .",
    "that would mean that there must have been a phase of deceleration in the late time universe , but it would not exclude a phase of acceleration .",
    "the important parameters of the sne are obtained by fitting their light - curves .",
    "the results depend on the fitter that is used .",
    "the most common fitter is mlcs2k2 @xcite . here",
    "we will also consider the salt fitting method @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the two methods is in how the peak luminosity corrections are determined by the colour of the sne @xcite .",
    "while mlcs2k2 assumes that the corrections that have to be made are only due to dust , salt takes an empirically approach to determine the relation between the colour and the luminosity correction .    for the analysis we take the following sn ia",
    "data sets :    gold 2007 ( mlcs2k2 ) : the gold sample by riess et al .",
    "( 2007 ) @xcite , which was obtained by using the mlcs2k2 fitting method    essence ( mlcs2k2 ) : the set given by wood - vasey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) @xcite , which includes data from essence , snls @xcite and nearby sne @xcite , fitted with mlcs2k2    essence ( salt ) : the same set fitted with salt    as suggested by riess et al .",
    "@xcite , we discarded all sne with a redshift of @xmath42 from the gold sample , which leaves us 182 sne with @xmath43 .",
    "in essence ( mlcs2k2 ) and essence ( salt ) , the sne with bad light curve fits were rejected for each fitting method",
    "this leaves 162 sne for essence ( mlcs2k2 ) and 178 for essence ( salt ) with @xmath44 .",
    "153 of the sne are contained in both sets . due to the differences of the sne contained in essence ( mlcs2k2 ) and essence ( salt )",
    "we will refer to them as different sets in the following .",
    "nevertheless , you should keep in mind that they share a large number of sne and thus are not independent sets .",
    "the riess calibration yields a value for the v - band magnitude of @xmath45mag , where @xmath46 is the time of the b - band maximum . for the gold 2007 set @xmath47",
    "was considered to be @xmath48mag .",
    "therefore , in order to get the appropriate distance modulus @xmath49 , we need to substract @xmath50mag from the value given in the gold sample . from the distance modulus values in the essence sets",
    "@xmath51mag have to be substracted because in these sets a b - band magnitude of @xmath52mag is assumed and riess et al .",
    "@xcite give the relation @xmath53 .",
    "for this calibration one gets a hubble constant of @xmath54 .    the results of sandage et al .",
    "@xcite for the sne absolute magnitudes are @xmath55mag and @xmath56mag and for the hubble constant @xmath57(statistical ) @xmath58 5.0(systematic ) .",
    "so considering the sandage calibration , we have to add 0.02mag to distance moduli of the gold sample and substract 0.01mag from the values given in the essence sets .",
    "the relevant parameter for our analysis is @xmath28 given by equation .",
    "its values are plotted in figure [ deltamufig ] for the sne of the three data sets and the two different calibration methods .",
    "the curve for a flat @xmath59cdm model ( with @xmath60 ) is shown in the plots in order to give the reader a notion of how the redshift - dependency of @xmath61 could look like .",
    "most of the data values are positive which indicates an accelerated expansion .",
    "a similar diagram has been presented by gong et al .",
    "@xcite for single sne as well as for binned sn data where they used a combined gold and essence data set .",
    "they kept the arbitrary value of the absolute magnitude @xmath12 given in the set and then determined the hubble constant by using sne with @xmath62 to be @xmath63 . at this point",
    "they stopped their analysis by concluding that due to the large number of sne that lie above the curve of a universe with @xmath22 , accelerated expansion is evident .",
    "but the fact that there are also several data points below that curve and that the errors @xmath33 ( with a typical value of 0.23mag for mlcs2k2 and 0.18mag for salt ) are approximately of the same size as the values @xmath28 give rise to the question how certain acceleration really is .",
    "thus , we will provide a more quantitative analysis in this work .",
    "+   +    we counted the sne of each set whose values of @xmath28 were above the action limit @xmath64 and those above @xmath39 ( which indicates acceleration at a 95% and a 99% cl , respectively ) and those with values below @xmath65 and below @xmath66 ( which indicates deceleration ) .",
    "the results are shown in table [ acctab1 ] .",
    "the clearest evidence for an accelerated expansion is given by the essence ( salt ) set with the riess calibration with 64 sne indicating acceleration at a 99% confidence level and none indicating deceleration . also in the other sets accelerated expansion is preferred with the exception of essence ( mlcs2k2 ) in the sandage calibration where none of the two expansion histories is preferred in the test using the action limit @xmath67 .",

    "( for a discussion on these differences at low redshifts , see @xcite . )",
    "this could be an indication that at least one of the two fitting methods does not give the correct result . in order to consider this possibility we take a look at the differences between @xmath28 obtained by salt and @xmath28 obtained by mlcs2k2 .",
    "they are shown in figure [ mudiff ] for the 153 sne contained in both essence sets .",
    "for some sne the difference is very large ( namely up to one magnitude ) . in order to see",

    "the result is shown in figure [ weightmudiff ] .",

    "therefore , the average over all sne of a set does not characterize the function @xmath74 .",

    "thus , their value of @xmath92 does not hold .",
    "the shortcoming of the work of gong et al .",
    "@xcite is that they have not applied any statistics at all .    instead of only considering single sne",

    "we argue that we reject the null hypothesis of no acceleration for a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe at high confidence ( @xmath93 ) .",

    "for the two different light - curve fitters applied to the essence sne using the riess calibration , we get values of 11.9@xmath0 and 17.0@xmath0 .    wood - vasey et al .",
    "argue that the differences due to different light curve fitters are not important as they disappear when marginalization is applied @xcite .",
    "this is true if the data are only used to determine the parameter values of a certain cosmological model as in this case no calibration of @xmath12 and @xmath13 is needed . but",
    "nevertheless , the fitters should give the same result for a given absolute magnitude @xmath12 .",
    "if this is not the case , a systematic error in the determination of the apparent magnitude @xmath26 is introduced by at least one of the fitters .",
    "systematics due to different fitters have also been described in @xcite and those within the gold sample in @xcite .",
    "the different results obtained by the two calibrations are very surprising .",
    "our test only depends on the reduced distance modulus @xmath94 and not on the absolute magnitude or the hubble constant individually .",
    "( note that this is the quantity which is marginalized when fitting cosmological parameters . )",
    "starting from different calibrations @xmath95 and @xmath96 leads to different values of @xmath13 , determined by observation of sne , in such a way that @xmath97 should in principle be the same for both values of @xmath12 .",
    "thus our test should not depend on the calibration .",
    "however , the fact that the calibration changes our result significantly can be explained as follows : @xmath13 is determined by observing sne .",
    "riess et al .  and sandage et al .",
    "use different sets of sne and different fitting methods for this determination .",
    "the systematic errors due to different sets and fitters then of course also influence the result for the hubble constant leading to different values @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    for a conservative conclusion , we need to take the set that gives the weakest evidence for acceleration , namely essence ( mlcs2k2 ) in the sandage calibration . using this set ,",
    "accelerated expansion can be stated at 5@xmath0 if we assume a spatially flat or closed universe . in an open universe",
    "the evidence is much weaker , namely 1.8@xmath0 .",
    "these results only hold if the correct analysis of sne is somewhere in the range of the cases we considered here . but as we observe enormous systematic effects in our test , we can not be sure of this assumption .",
    "thus , it is a major issue to better understand how sne have to be observed and analyzed .",
    "remember that results of this work are only valid if the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the situation changes dramatically if we give up those assumptions .",
    "there exist enormously large structures in the universe , an example is the sloan great wall with an extension of @xmath100400 mpc @xcite . besides , there are also big voids and superclusters on a 100 mpc scale .",
    "this roughness of the universe could spoil the validity of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "indeed it is possible to construct inhomogeneous models that can describe the observational data without the need of an average acceleration @xcite .    some observational evidence for inhomogeneity and anisotropy in sn hubble diagrams has recently been presented by @xcite , probably due to large scale bulk motion and perhaps systematic effects . a non - trivial scale dependence of the hubble rate due to the so - called cosmological backreaction @xcite has been shown in @xcite .",
    "this effect of averaging can also mimic curvature effects @xcite and thus strongly influence the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state , as has been shown in @xcite .",
    "thus we think a major task must be to establish the acceleration of the universe independently of the assumption of strict homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "we thank dragan huterer , thanu padmanabhan , aleksandar raki , adam riess and bastian weinhorst for discussions , comments and references to the literature .",
