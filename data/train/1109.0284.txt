    "in recent years , studies have unveiled the existence at @xmath5 1 - 2 of a population of massive spheroidal galaxies with small size , hence called compact ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and also references therein ) .",
    "when comparing those high redshift galaxies with local ones of similar mass , it appears that their sizes are smaller by a factor of @xmath62 - 3 and up to 5 @xcite .",
    "the general view is that the compactness increases with redshift , mass and the level of quiescence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "despite potential selection biases affecting the comparison of high vs low redshift samples ( see hereafter ) , which might affect conclusions on the evolution in size , the existence of a significant number of compact galaxies at high redshift is firmly established ..    the presence of compact etgs in the local universe is still debatable .",
    "apparent disagreements may come from the different definitions for a compact galaxy ( i.e. the different mass and size criteria chosen to define a galaxy as compact ) .",
    "for example , on the one hand , the analysis of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) samples reveals that a negligible fraction of galaxies are compact @xcite , even when taking into account the possible incompleteness due to the sdss spectroscopic target selection algorithm @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite studied etgs in local clusters and found that a significant fraction of their sample is made of compact objects . when compared to high redshift samples @xcite ,",

    "the picture concerning the subsequent evolution of compact galaxies down to @xmath8 is more difficult to draw .",
    "the comparison of high redshift to local samples may be affected by two selection biases : age selection bias against young galaxies in high redshift samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and progenitor bias due to morphological evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . within this context",
    ", it is still unclear which part of the galaxy population went through evolution and which mechanism contributed to it .",
    "if the compact galaxy population requires evolution , one efficient process may be minor dry mergers @xcite : through the accretion of gas - poor satellites , a compact galaxy will increase significantly its size with a limited increase of its mass and no star formation . in this scenario",
    ", the accreted material will extend the outer parts of the compact galaxy , leaving its core unchanged .",
    "this is in remarkable agreement with observations : local elliptical galaxies have in their core regions surface stellar density profiles similar to those of high - redshift compact galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "another proposed scenario for size evolution of compact spheroids is expansion consequent to substantial mass losses due to , e.g. , stellar winds and/or quasar feedback @xcite .    to go deeper in understanding these mechanisms ,",

    "the fact that @xcite do not find an environmental dependence on the evolution of the msr and we do , probably reflects the different range in mass probed by the two works .",

    "recent works have found very compact galaxies in the field at @xmath147 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "our galaxies with masses @xmath126 are a few , and show a large dispersion in size : they lie on the local msr independently of the environment ( see figure [ fig : msr ] ) , but their small number does not permit us to draw conclusions on their behaviour .",

    "are on average more compact in denser environments . when comparing the msr at high redshift with the one in the local universe , the uncertainty on the mass coming from the model used to estimate it and the choice of the local msr can significantly influence the conclusion on the importance of the size evolution . when using ma05/cb07 models , we find that the majority of cluster and group etgs are below the local relations , whereas field etgs follow a msr similar to the local one . from a kolmogorov - smirnov ( kuiper )",
    "statistical test , the cluster and field samples for galaxies with masses @xmath122 do not follow the same size ratio distribution , at 85% ( 90% ) and 90% ( 95% ) using ma05 and cb07 models , respectively .",
    "when using bc03 models , the two distributions do not differ .",

    "those results are in close agreement with those of @xcite , who studied a sample of 62 etgs with @xmath148 .",
    "as concluded by these authors , the lack of dependence of the compactness on the redshift of formation is not consistent with models that predict compact galaxies to have formed at earlier times , when the universe was more dense .",
    "when we compare the msr of cluster and group etgs vs field etgs , we find that , at similar masses , cluster and group etgs are more compact than field etgs . on average this does not depend on cluster galaxy age .",
    "this result is in contrast with what has been found so far for field galaxies at @xmath110 at higher masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it might be due to the different range in masses that we are probing .",
    "if this was confirmed by larger samples , it would mean that environmental effects are visible in the evolution of the msr for etgs with @xmath3 .",
    "our results are mainly driven by galaxies with masses @xmath149 .",
    "our galaxies with masses @xmath4 follow the same trends that the entire sample .",
    "our galaxies with masses @xmath126 are a few , but they lie on the local msr independently of the environment ( see figure [ fig : msr ] ) ; however their small number does not permit us to draw conclusions on their behaviour . as concluded by other authors",
    "@xcite , the very compact galaxies at @xmath150 should have gone a dramatic evolution in size to reproduce our results at @xmath2 .",
    "this growth between @xmath150 and @xmath110 seems to be somehow different in cluster and field galaxies . @xcite",
    "have shown that , in the field , etgs enlarge their size and increase their stellar mass by a factor of 5 between @xmath151 and @xmath110 . at @xmath0 ,",
    "field galaxies are already on the local msr , while cluster galaxies still have compact sizes on average ( see also * ? ? ? * for a similar result at @xmath152 ) , indicating that their size distribution still needs to be enlarged ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "since in the local universe , the etg msr does not depend on environment @xcite , our results imply that an evolution in the msr of cluster and group etg size is required to explain current observations , while field etgs show a msr that is compatible with the local one .",
    "the evolution of the msr in dense environments might reflect either an evolution in size of the pristine population or the transformation of etg progenitors that are not classified as etg at @xmath2 or the accretion of a new population of larger etgs .    in the first case , minor dry merger events",
    "could have enlarged the size of the etg population . in the second case ,",
    "compact etgs might have not had much evolution , but a new population of larger etgs could have been formed by not - etg progenitors or accreted in dense environments at @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "this new population might not have been observed at @xmath2 because its progenitors are not etgs at that time .",
    "these galaxies might be disk galaxies that have evolved from a large bulge spiral population or galaxy mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "these results pose some challenges to current state - of - the - art galaxy evolution models that predict a nearly mass - independent size for etgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , we have checked , nearly independent of environment .",
