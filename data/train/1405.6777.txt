    "nowadays the thermodynamic description of the efficient performance regimes in heat devices has been becoming of special relevance , due to the growing importance of saving energy resources in any operation of energy conversion .",
    "the carnot s theorem states the upper bounds of heat - energy conversion processes between two heat reservoirs at temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 : for a heat device working as a heat engine ( he ) the maximum efficiency is @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , while working as a refrigerator ( re ) the maximum coefficient of performance ( cop ) is @xmath5 .",
    "however , these upper bounds are of no practical use since they refer to reversible cycles with zero power output for he and zero cooling power for re . for the thermodynamic analysis of real heat devices ( working at non - zero rate along irreversible paths ) ,",
    "different models and different figures of merit ( based on thermodynamic , economic , compromised , and sustainable considerations ) have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "a part of such models is founded on finite - time thermodynamics ( ftt ) considerations .",
    "ftt focuses on irreversibilities caused by finite - rate heat transfers between the working fluid , and the external heat reservoirs , internal dissipation of the working fluid and heat leaks between the heat reservoirs .",
    "the optimization procedure in ftt , carried out under a fixed cycle time , usually assumes two degrees of freedom , that is , the inner temperatures of the isothermal steps of the working system  @xcite . in spite of their analytical simplicity , these models can reproduce , at least qualitatively , the power - efficiency and the cooling power - cop behaviors observed in real he  @xcite and re  @xcite .",
    "more simplified ftt models assume the so - called endoreversible approximation  @xcite , where the heat leaks and the internal dissipations are neglected . in this case , if the linear heat transfer laws are additionally assumed for the external heat exchange , the resulting efficiency at maximum power becomes the well - known curzon - ahlborn ( ca ) efficiency @xmath6  @xcite .    in the recently proposed low - dissipation ( ld )",
    "model  @xcite , the basic starting point is that the entropy production in the isothermal hot ( cold ) heat exchange process is assumed to behave as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 denoting the corresponding time durations , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 being coefficients containing information on the irreversibility sources . considering @xmath9 and @xmath10 as degrees of freedom for optimization , the ld model for he provides the upper ( @xmath13 ) and lower ( @xmath14 ) bounds for the efficiency at maximum power @xmath15 under extremely asymmetric dissipation limits @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . indeed , the ld model allows us to recover the curzon - ahlborn value @xmath18 when symmetric dissipation is considered ( @xmath19 ) , in this case without assuming any specific heat transfer law .",
    "an important result of the ld model for he is the linking of the ca efficiency to symmetry considerations , providing a unified framework to understand the quasi - universal behavior shown by the efficiency at maximum power of many different kinds of heat engines .",
    "an extension of the ld model to re was also reported  @xcite , but in this case considering , as a figure of merit , the @xmath20 function defined as @xmath21 , being @xmath22 and @xmath23 the cop and the cooling power , respectively .",
    "the lower ( @xmath24 ) and upper ( @xmath25 ) bounds of the cop at maximum @xmath20 were obtained under extremely asymmetric dissipation limits @xmath26 and @xmath17 , respectively  @xcite . under the symmetric condition ( @xmath19 ) , the optimized cop was found to be @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "this result , obtained previously in different contexts  @xcite , could be viewed as a counterpart of the ca efficiency for he , though this point is a current issue of discussion  @xcite ( see sec .",
    "linear irreversible thermodynamics ( lit ) is a well - founded formalism , which is focused on the irreversible evolution of macroscopic systems allowing us to extend the scope of the equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "lit assumes systems in local equilibrium and defines thermodynamic forces and fluxes both interlinked by means of linear relationships governing the macroscopic evolution . from the lit principles , it is possible to construct models of heat devices  @xcite , from which the optimization procedure considers the thermodynamic force as the sole relevant degree of freedom . in",
    "lit the endoreversible features of the simplified ftt models ( including the ca model  @xcite ) of heat devices are recovered under the so - called tight - coupling condition  @xcite .",
    "minimally nonlinear irreversible thermodynamic ( mnlit ) models have also been proposed for cyclic and steady - state heat devices , in order to account for possible thermal dissipation effects in the interaction between the working system and the external heat reservoirs  @xcite .",
    "these models incorporate the onsager relations with an additional nonlinear dissipation term . as in lit ,",
    "the optimization procedure also involves only one degree of freedom ( the thermodynamic flux ) , and the outstanding results provided by the low - dissipation models  @xcite are recovered by the mnlit model as a particular case  @xcite and  @xcite ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we stress that a numerical validation of the ld - model and thus the mnlit model has been confirmed in a computer simulation of a carnot cycle with a single particle  @xcite",
    ". however , the mnlit models are subject to some criticism . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that the mnlit models are misleading , since dissipations should naturally appear in the lit models when the local onsager relations are extended to a global scale .",
    "indeed , for the thermoelectric devices these authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the joule dissipation is well - founded in lit based on this argument .",
    "however , for any generic heat device , the relation between the local and global scales may be too complicated or it simply has not been obtained yet . in such cases , the addition of the dissipative terms adopted in the mnlit models could be considered as a reasonable and natural assumption in order to explain the thermodynamic ( macroscopic ) influence of the local dissipative effects on a generic heat device .",
    "the present paper is aimed to present results obtained by the mnlit models for both he and re , and it has two main goals : ( i ) to present a unified description of non - isothermal heat devices for he and re , making emphasis on the global performance characteristics of the behaviors of power - efficiency and cooling power - cop curves , including the non - tight - coupling case ; and ( ii ) to analyze the maximum efficiency and the efficiency at maximum power regimes for he and the maximum cop and the cop at maximum cooling power regimes for re .",
    "especially , we reveal the impacts of irreversibilities by heat leaks ( degrees of the coupling strength ) , internal dissipations , and their interplay on the performance of the heat devices , by considering their various limits .    to attain these goals , after giving a brief theoretical background in sec .",
    "ii , we present in sec .",
