    "@xmath0 next , we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing the design parameters , which is a very challenging mixed discrete - continuous optimization problem .",
    "we propose a two - step optimization framework to obtain a near optimal solution with superior performance and manageable complexity .",
    "specifically , we first characterize the structural properties of the asymptotically optimal solutions . then , based on these properties , we obtain the near optimal solution , which achieves better performance in the general region than any asymptotically optimal solution , under a mild condition .",
    "@xmath0 finally , by numerical simulations , we show that the near optimal solution achieves a significant gain in successful transmission probability over some baseline schemes .",
    "we consider a two - tier hetnet where a macro - cell tier is overlaid with a pico - cell tier , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] . the locations of the macro - bss and the pico - bss",

    "the locations of the users are also distributed as an independent homogeneous ppp @xmath6 with density @xmath7 .",
    "we refer to the macro - cell tier and the pico - cell tier as the @xmath8st tier and the @xmath9nd tier , respectively .",
    "consider the downlink scenario .",
    "each bs in the @xmath10th tier has one transmit antenna with transmission power @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 .",
    "each user has one receive antenna .",
    "all bss are operating on the same frequency band of total bandwidth @xmath14 ( hz ) .",
    "consider a discrete - time system with time being slotted and study one slot of the network .",
    "we consider both large - scale fading and small - scale fading . due to",
    "large - scale fading , a transmitted signal from the @xmath10th tier with distance @xmath15 is attenuated by a factor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the path loss exponent of the @xmath10th tier . for small - scale fading , we assume rayleigh fading channels@xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the set of @xmath19 files ( e.g. , data objects or chucks of data objects ) in the hetnet .",
    "for ease of illustration , assume that all files have the same size .",

    "each user randomly requests one file , which is file @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the file popularity distribution is given by @xmath23 , which is assumed to be known apriori .",
    "in addition , without loss of generality ( w.l.o.g . ) , assume @xmath24 .",
    "the hetnet consists of cache - enabled macro - bss and pico - bss .",
    "each bs in the @xmath10th tier is equipped with a cache of size @xmath25 to store different files .",
    "assume @xmath26 .",
    "each macro - bs is connected to the core network via a wireline backhaul link of transmission capacity @xmath27 ( files / slot ) , i.e. , each macro - bs can retrieve at most @xmath28 different files from the core network in each slot .",

    "we are interested in the case where the storage and backhaul resources are limited , and may not be able to satisfy all file requests . in this section ,",
    "we propose a joint caching and multicasting design with certain design parameters , which can provide high spatial file diversity and ensure efficient content dissemination .      to provide high spatial file diversity , we propose a _ hybrid caching design _ consisting of identical caching in the 1st tier and random caching in the 2nd tier , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the set of @xmath32 files cached in the @xmath10th tier . specifically ,",
    "our hybrid caching design satisfies the following requirements : ( i ) _ non - overlapping caching across tiers _ : each file is stored in at most one tier ; ( ii ) _ identical caching in the 1st tier _ : each macro - bs stores the same set @xmath33 of @xmath29 ( different ) files ; and ( iii ) _ random caching in the 2nd tier _ : each pico - bs randomly stores @xmath30 different files out of all files in @xmath34 , forming a subset of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we have the following constraint : @xmath35    to further illustrate the random caching in the 2nd tier , we first introduce some notations .",

    "then , based on the insights obtained , we shall focus on reducing complexity while maintaining superior performance . ]",
    "@xmath50 denote @xmath51 . to facilitate the analysis in later sections , based on @xmath52",

    "note that @xmath52 and @xmath58 depend on @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in this paper , we use @xmath59 and @xmath60 when emphasizing this relation .",
    "therefore , the hybrid caching design in the cache - enabled hetnet is specified by the design parameters @xmath61 .    to efficiently utilize backhaul links and ensure high spatial file diversity",

    "let @xmath62 denote the set of @xmath63 files which can be retrieved by each macro - bs from the core network .",
    "thus , we have the following constraint : @xmath64 therefore , the file distribution in the cache - enabled hetnet is fully specified by the hybrid caching design @xmath61 .      in this part",
    ", we propose a multicasting design associated with the hybrid caching design @xmath61 .",
    "first , we introduce the user association under the proposed hybrid caching design . in the cache - enabled hetnet ,",
    "a user accesses to a tier based on its desired file .",
    "specifically , each user requesting file @xmath65 is associated with the nearest macro - bs and is referred to as a macro - user . while , each user requesting file @xmath44 is associated with the nearest pico - bs storing a combination @xmath66 ( containing file @xmath67 ) and is referred to as a pico - user .",
    "the associated bs of each user is called its serving bs , and offers the maximum long - term average receive power for its desired file@xcite .",
    "note that under the proposed hybrid caching design @xmath61 , the serving bs of a macro - user is its nearest macro - bs , while the serving bs of a pico - user ( affected by @xmath52 ) may not be its geographically nearest bs .",
    "we refer to this association mechanism as the _ content - centric association _ in the cached - enabled hetnet , which is different from the traditional _ connection - based association _",
    "@xcite in hetnets .",
    "now , we introduce file scheduling in the cache - enabled hetnet",
    ". each bs will serve all the cached files requested by its associated users .",
    "each macro - bs only serves at most @xmath28 uncached files requested by its associated users , due to the backhaul constraint for retrieving uncached files .",
    "in particular , if the users of a macro - bs request smaller than or equal to @xmath28 different uncached files , the macro - bs serves all of them ; if the users of a macro - bs request greater than @xmath28 different uncached files , the macro - bs will randomly select @xmath28 different requested uncached files to serve , out of all the requested uncached files according to the uniform distribution .",
    "we consider multicasting in the cache - enabled hetnet for efficient content dissemination .",
    "suppose a bs schedules to serve requests for @xmath68 different files .",
    "then , it transmits each of the @xmath68 files at rate @xmath69 ( bit / second ) and over @xmath70 of total bandwidth w using fdma .",
    "all the users which request one of the @xmath68 files from this bs try to decode the file from the single multicast transmission of the file at the bs .",
    "note that , by avoiding transmitting the same file multiple times to multiple users , this content - centric transmission ( multicast ) can improve the efficiency of the utilization of the wireless medium and reduce the load of the wireless links , compared to the traditional connection - based transmission ( unicast ) .    from the above illustration",
    ", we can see that the proposed multicasting design is also affected by the proposed hybrid caching design @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the design parameters @xmath61 affect the performance of the proposed joint caching and multicasting design .",
    "in this paper , w.l.o.g . , we study the performance of the typical user denoted as @xmath71 , which is located at the origin .",
    "we assume all bss are active .",
    "suppose @xmath71 requests file @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the index of the tier to which @xmath71 belongs , and let @xmath73 denote the other tier .",
    "let @xmath74 denote the index of the serving bs of @xmath71 .",
    "we denote @xmath75 and @xmath76 as the distance and the small - scale channel between bs @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "we assume the complex additive white gaussian noise of power @xmath79 at @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath78 requests file @xmath67 and file @xmath67 is transmitted by bs @xmath80 , the signal - to - interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) of @xmath78 is given by @xmath81    when @xmath71 requests file @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , let @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) denote the numbers of different cached and uncached files requested by the users associated with bs @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath71 requests file @xmath44 , let @xmath89 denote the number of different cached files requested by the users associated with bs @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath91 are discrete random variables , the probability mass functions ( p.m.f.s ) of which depend on @xmath92 , @xmath93 and the design parameters @xmath94 .",
    "in addition , if @xmath95 , bs @xmath80 will transmit file @xmath67 for sure ; if @xmath96 , for given @xmath97 , bs @xmath80 will transmit file @xmath67 with probability @xmath98 . given that file @xmath67 is transmitted , it can be decoded correctly at @xmath71 if the channel capacity between bs @xmath80 and @xmath71 is greater than or equal to @xmath99 .",
    "requesters are mostly concerned with whether their desired files can be successfully received .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we consider the successful transmission probability of a file requested by @xmath71 as the network performance metric . by total probability theorem ,",
    "the successful transmission probability under the proposed scheme is given by : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is given by , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are given by and , respectively .",
    "note that in and , each term multiplied by @xmath104 represents the successful transmission probability of file @xmath67 .",
    "later , we shall see that under the proposed caching and multicasting design for content - oriented services in the cache - enabled hetnet , the successful transmission probability is sufficiently different from the traditional rate coverage probability studied for connection - oriented services @xcite .",
    "in particular , the successful transmission probability considered in this paper not only depends on the physical layer parameters , such as the macro and pico bs densities @xmath105 and @xmath106 , user density @xmath93 , path loss exponents @xmath107 and @xmath108 , bandwidth @xmath14 , backhaul capacity @xmath28 and transmit signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) @xmath109 and @xmath110 , but also relies on the content - related parameters , such as the popularity distribution @xmath92 , the cache sizes @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the design parameters @xmath111 . while , the traditional rate coverage probability only depends on the physical layer parameters . in addition",
    ", the successful transmission probability depends on the physical layer parameters in a different way from the traditional rate coverage probability .",
    "for example , the content - centric association leads to different distributions of the locations of serving and interfering bss ; the multicasting transmission results in different file load distributions at each bs @xcite ; and the cache - enabled architecture makes content availability related to bs densities .",

    "<S> heterogeneous wireless networks ( hetnets ) provide a powerful approach to meet the dramatic mobile traffic growth , but also impose a significant challenge on backhaul . </S>",
    "<S> caching and multicasting at macro and pico base stations ( bss ) are two promising methods to support massive content delivery and reduce backhaul load in hetnets . in this paper , we jointly consider caching and multicasting in a large - scale cache - enabled hetnet with backhaul constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a hybrid caching design consisting of identical caching in the macro - tier and random caching in the pico - tier , and a corresponding multicasting design . by carefully handling different types of interferers and adopting appropriate approximations </S>",
    "<S> , we derive tractable expressions for the successful transmission probability in the general region as well as the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and user density region , utilizing tools from stochastic geometry . </S>",
    "<S> then , we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing the design parameters , which is a very challenging mixed discrete - continuous optimization problem . by using optimization techniques and exploring the structural properties </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a near optimal solution with superior performance and manageable complexity . </S>",
    "<S> this solution achieves better performance in the general region than any asymptotically optimal solution , under a mild condition . </S>",
