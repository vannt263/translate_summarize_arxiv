    "electronic transport in low dimensional systems is a key to explore important interference effects , local currents , switching mechanisms and other unique properties that are pre - requisites for estimating the potentiality of these systems as quantum interference devices  @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of work in this direction has already revealed the unique features of phase coherent electron transport through quantum dots ( qd ) , aharonov - bohm ( ab ) rings , and model molecular systems  @xcite .",
    "a major part of the studies in low - dimensions so far describes electron transport in the so called two - terminal nano- or mesoscopic devices  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is a fast developing field , and has stimulated lot of theoretical work based on the non - equilibrium green s function approach within the density functional theory  @xcite .    comparatively speaking ,",
    "much smaller volume of literature on the three or four terminal electronic transport have come up in recent times  @xcite .",
    "a two - terminal device is essentially a single path device .",
    "the transport here is marked by a sharp jump in the transmission phase , and is constrained by the onsager relations of time reversal symmetry  @xcite and the current conservation  @xcite .",
    "so , the inclusion of a third terminal that allows the current to flow out of the system and breaks the unitarity condition , is likely to be useful in extracting useful information related to the quantum coherence is low - dimensional systems  @xcite .    in this communication",
    "we undertake an in - depth study of the three - terminal magneto - transport of interacting electrons in a fractal network .",
    "specifically , we choose a fractal geometry following a sierpinski gasket ( spg )  @xcite .",
    "such a planar gasket is shown in figs .",
    "[ spg1 ] and [ spg2 ] , and can be thought to be equivalent to a self - similar arrangement of single level qd s  @xcite sitting at the vertices of each elementary triangle . with the present day advancement in lithography    practically any design can be tailor made , and the present work thus offers an excellent opportunity to study the simultaneous effects of magnetic field , electron - electron interaction and the dephasing caused by the introduction of a third lead in the system .",
    "our motivation behind the present work is two - fold .",
    "first , we observe that the multi - terminal transport in systems with multiply connected geometry is a very little addressed ( or , unaddressed ) problem . in particular , the in - built self similarity of systems such as",
    "the spg opens up the possibility of investigating the tunneling or switching aspect of these systems at arbitrarily small scales of energy .",
    "secondly , it is essential , for a completeness in the understanding of the spectral properties of fractal networks to know , if the well known multi - fractal , cantor set energy spectrum of non - interacting electrons  @xcite still retains its character even in the presence of electron - electron interaction or dephasing caused by a third electrode . in a recent work , the effect of electron - electron interactions on the persistent current in a closed loop spg has been reported  @xcite , but no result exists for open self - similar systems connected to electron reservoirs by multiple leads .    on its own merit ,",
    "the effect of electron - electron interaction on the spectral properties is of great importance .",
    "several experiments done on fractal networks have studied the magnetoresistance , the    superconductor - normal phase boundaries on sierpinski gasket wire networks  @xcite .",
    "these experiments pioneered the actual observational studies of spectral properties and flux quantization effects on planar networks and the aharonov - bohm effect in systems without translational invariance .",
    "although in an early paper the problem of interacting electrons on a percolating cluster that displays a fractal geometry  @xcite , has been addressed , to the best of our knowledge , no rigorous effort has been made so far to unravel the effect of an interplay of electron - electron interaction and an external magnetic field on deterministic networks such as a sierpinski gasket ( spg ) , even at a mean field level .",
    "thus , apart from a critical investigation of the possibility of a fractal _ device _ , the present work is also likely to throw light on the fundamental spectral properties of the _ deterministically disordered _ systems .",
    "we find quite interesting results .",
    "working within a tight - binding framework we develop a mean field method of studying the three - terminal transport in interacting systems .",
    "the method is then applied to a planar spg and we show that , dephasing definitely reduces the corner - to - corner propagation of electrons , with or without the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the magnetic field , in the absence of the electron - electron interaction generates an apparent continuum in the transmission spectrum .",
    "the _ continuum _ has already been observed in several fractal lattices  @xcite including an spg  @xcite , and is practically unaffected even when the electron - electron interaction is switched ` on ' .",
    "a detailed study on the effect of positioning of the third electrode is also made , and the transport properties of an anisotropic gasket are compared with its isotropic counterpart . for a comparative study ,",
    "the results of the two - terminal transport are also presented along with the three - terminal cases .    in what follows ,",
    "we present our model quantum system in section ii .",
    "the essentials of the mean field calculation are discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv contains the numerical results and related discussions , and we draw our conclusions in section v.",
    "let us begin by referring to fig .",
    "[ spg1 ] where a @xmath0-rd generation spg is attached to two semi - infinite one - dimensional ( @xmath1d ) metallic leads , namely , lead-1 and lead-2 via the atomic sites a and b. each elementary plaquette of the gasket is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath2 ( measured in unit of the elementary flux quantum @xmath3 ) .",
    "the filled red circles correspond to the positions of atomic sites in the spg . in a wannier basis",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian of the interacting gasket reads , @xmath4 \\nonumber \\\\ &   & + \\sum_i u c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}c_{i\\uparrow } c_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger } c_{i\\downarrow } \\label{spgham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath5 is the on - site energy of an electron at the site @xmath6 of spin @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 is the nearest - neighbor hopping strength . in the case of an anisotropic spg ,",
    "the anisotropy is introduced only in the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath9 which takes on values @xmath10 and @xmath11 for hopping along the _ horizontal _ and the _ angular _ bonds , respectively . due to",
    "the presence of magnetic flux @xmath2 , a phase factor @xmath12 appears in the hamiltonian when an electron hops from one site to another site .",
    "a negative sign comes in when the electron hops in the reverse direction . as the magnetic filed associated with @xmath2",
    "does not penetrate any part of the circumference of the elementary triangle , we ignore the zeeman term in the above tight - binding hamiltonian ( eq .  [ spgham ] ) . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of an electron at the site @xmath6 with spin @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath15 is the strength of on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian for the non - interacting leads can be expressed as , @xmath16 where different parameters correspond to their usual meaning .",
    "these leads are directly coupled to the gasket where the hopping integral between the lead-1 and gasket is @xmath17 , and , it is @xmath18 between the gasket and lead-2 . with this setup",
    "we investigate two - terminal electron transport through an spg .    for three - terminal quantum transport",
    "we connect an additional lead with the gasket . a schematic view of a @xmath0-rd generation spg attached to three semi - infinite @xmath1d metallic leads , viz , lead-1 , lead-2 and lead-3 is shown in fig .",
    "the gasket and the side - attached leads are described by the same prescriptions as described above .",
    "before going to the calculation of electronic transmission probability through the interacting model of an spg described by the tight - binding hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "[ spgham ] , first we decouple the interacting hamiltonian using the generalized hartree - fock approach  @xcite . the full hamiltonian is completely decoupled into two parts .",
    "one is associated with the up - spin electrons , while the other is with the down - spin electrons .",
    "the on - site potentials get modified appropriately , and are given by , @xmath19 @xmath20 where , @xmath21 is the number operator . with these site energies , the full hamiltonian ( eq .  [ spgham ] ) can be written in the decoupled form ( in the mean field ( mf ) approximation ) as , @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_i \\epsilon_{i\\downarrow}^{\\prime } n_{i\\downarrow } + \\sum_{\\langle   ij \\rangle } v \\left[e^{i\\theta } c_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger } c_{j\\downarrow } + e^{-i\\theta } c_{j\\downarrow}^{\\dagger } c_{i\\downarrow}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\sum_i u \\langle n_{i\\uparrow } \\rangle \\langle n_{i\\downarrow }   \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & h_{\\mbox{spg},\\uparrow } + h_{\\mbox{spg},\\downarrow } -   \\sum_i u \\langle n_{i\\uparrow } \\rangle \\langle n_{i\\downarrow } \\rangle \\label{equ400 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to the effective tight - binding hamiltonians for the up and down spin electrons , respectively .",
    "the last term is a constant term which provides a shift in the total energy .      with these decoupled hamiltonians ( @xmath25 and @xmath24 ) of up and down spin electrons ,",
    "now we start our self consistent procedure considering initial guess values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for these initial set of values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we numerically diagonalize the up and down spin hamiltonians",
    ". then we calculate a new set of values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these steps are repeated until a self consistent solution is achieved .",
    "now we are at the stage of calculating electron conduction across an spg .    to determine two - terminal conductance ( @xmath28 ) of the gasket , we use landauer conductance formula  @xcite .",
    "at much low temperature and bias voltage it can be expressed as , @xmath29 where , @xmath30 and @xmath31 correspond to the transmission probabilities of up and down spin electrons , respectively , across the spg .",
    "since no spin - flip scattering term exists in the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ spgham ] ) , spin - flip transmission probabilities will not appear in eq .",

    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are the retarded and advanced green s functions , respectively , of the spg including the effects of the leads .",
    "for the complete system i.e. , the spg and two leads , the green s function is expressed as , @xmath38 where , @xmath39 is the energy of the injecting electron .",
    "evaluation of this green s function needs the inversion of an infinite matrix , which is really a difficult task , since the full system consists of the finite size gasket and two semi - infinite @xmath1d leads .",
    "however , the full system can be partitioned into sub - matrices corresponding to the individual sub - systems and the green s function for the gasket can be effectively written as , @xmath40 where , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the self - energies due to coupling of the gasket to the lead-@xmath1 and lead-@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "all information of the coupling are included into these self - energies .      in order to calculate the conductance in three - terminal spg , we use bttiker formalism , an elegant and simple way to study electron transport through multi - terminal mesoscopic systems . in this formalism",
    "we treat all the leads ( current and voltage leads ) on an equal footing and extend the two - terminal linear response formula to get the conductance between the terminals , indexed by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in the form  @xcite , @xmath45 where , @xmath46 gives the transmission probability of an electron with spin @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) from the lead-@xmath43 to lead-@xmath44 .",
    "now , similar to eq .",

    "we inspect all the essential features of magnetic response of an spg network at absolute zero temperature and use the units where @xmath50 . throughout our numerical work we set @xmath51 for all @xmath6 and choose the nearest - neighbor hopping strength @xmath52 . in the anisotropic case we select @xmath53 and @xmath54 throughout .",
    "for side - attached leads ,    the on - site energy ( @xmath55 ) and nearest - neighbor hopping strength ( @xmath56 ) are fixed at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the hopping integrals ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath59 ) between the leads and spg are set at @xmath60 .",
    "energy scale is measured in unit of @xmath9 .",
    "all the essential features of electron transport are obtained both for an isotropic gasket and its anisotropic counterpart .",
    "the two - terminal conductance of a @xmath61-th generation isotropic gasket is shown in fig .",
    "[ twotermsym ] with the leads connected in the positions a and b only .",
    "the left panel shows the conductance in zero magnetic field , and represents the familiar fragmented , scanty distribution of the transmission resonances that mark such a lattice .",
    "the on - site hubbard interaction displaces the resonance peaks , but no marked changes in the spectrum is observed .    with the magnetic field turned ` on ' there is however , a remarkable change .",
    "the spectrum apparently exhibits continuous parts , which have previously been reported  @xcite to support extended single particle states for spinless , non - interacting electrons .",
    "we observe here that , the electron - electron interaction , though reduces the overall conductance of the system , preserves the continuum at the central part of the spectrum . as the interaction @xmath15",
    "is increased , the central continuum is more or less undisturbed , though the average transmission amplitude still exhibits lower values compared to its @xmath62 counterpart .",
    "in addition , there is a signature of opening up of new gaps in the spectrum as it appears in fig .",
    "[ twotermsym](f ) .    in fig .",
    "[ twotermasym ] we show the two - terminal conductance across an spg of the same size as before , but now with a hopping anisotropy such that , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the effect of hopping anisotropy is , in general , to    increase the overall conductance . the sparse spectrum in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ twotermsym ] is now replaced by a substantial density of resonant transmission peaks .",
    "the introduction of @xmath15 still reduces the average conductance , but the action is now somewhat ` delayed ' .",
    "we need a larger value of @xmath15 to generate a noticeable change in the conductance spectrum .",
    "this is evident from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ twotermasym ] . on the right panel ,",
    "the interplay of the magnetic field and the electron - electron interaction is displayed .",
    "the central _ continuum _ of the isotropic gasket case is still there , but with numerous conductance minima somewhat obscuring the continuity of this part .",
    "as @xmath15 increases , one observes genuine anti - resonances in the previously sustained continuum in the spectrum .",
    "we now discuss the three - terminal transport in a spg network . on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ threetermsym1 ] the results of the conductance between the leads @xmath1 and @xmath35 are shown .",
    "the third terminal @xmath0 connects to    an electron reservoir .",
    "the effect of dephasing is obvious .",
    "the spectrum in zero magnetic field is even thinner now , and the interaction @xmath15 plays its part .",
    "the magnitude of the resonance peaks get suppressed compared to the coherent transport in the two - terminal case . a fine scrutiny ( not shown here )",
    "will reveal a level broadening due a dominant phase randomizing effect  @xcite leading to a loss of phase coherence .",
    "strangely enough , in presence of the magnetic field , the dephasing effect is just not enough to destroy or alter appreciably , the central continuous part of the conductance spectrum .",
    "we have carried out extensive numerical analysis of the continuum in the conductance spectrum , and it appears that the band remains intact over finer scales of energy interval and even for a larger sized spg .",
    "therefore , we are tempted to conclude that there exists a band of extended eigenstates ( characterized by finite transmittivity ) in an spg fractal threaded by a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the gasket and that , its a quite _ robust band _ , unperturbed by either the electron - electron interaction , or the presence of any dephasing effect .    in the asymmetric case however , the conductance is strongly sensitive on the lead positions .",
    "for example , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the conductance @xmath65 across the @xmath1-@xmath35 terminals is much larger compared to @xmath66 or @xmath67 , particularly in presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the apparent continuum in the spectrum persists , as before , even with an increasing value of @xmath15 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ threetermasym ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have examined in details , the three - terminal transport in a planar sierpinski gasket fractal with a magnetic field threading each elementary triangle .",
    "the electron - electron interaction is considered in the hubbard form , and the hamiltonian is solved within a generalized hartree - fock scheme .",
    "the sensitivity of the conductance spectrum on the positioning of the leads is studied extensively , and some prototype results have been displayed and discussed .",
    "it is seen that the major role of the third lead is to bring down the average conductance of the system . the same role is played by the hubbard interaction .",
    "the anisotropic gasket has been found to be more conducting than its isotropic counterpart with or without the electron - electron interaction",
    ". however , the curious result is that , the continuum of states generated in the spectrum of an spg as the magnetic field is turned on , is practically unaffected by the dephasing effect caused by the additional electrode or by the on - site hubbard interaction ."
