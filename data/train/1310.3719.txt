    "auxetic materials are rather special and unusual elastic solids .",
    "their poisson s ratio @xmath2 is negative , which means that it is easy to change their volume while fixing their shape , but it is hard to change their shape while fixing their volume @xcite .",
    "this behavior is just opposite to that of an ideal liquid @xcite and to that of an ideal pentamode metamaterial @xcite . in general , auxetic materials",
    "can be anisotropic , in which case the poisson s ratio turns into a poisson s matrix @xcite .",
    "there are no fundamental bounds for the values of the elements of the general poisson s matrix @xcite . in sharp contrast , there are established bounds for stable elastic isotropic media . here , the poisson s ratio is connected to the ratio of bulk modulus @xmath3 ( the inverse of the compressibility ) and shear modulus @xmath4 via @xcite @xmath5 for a stable elastic solid , neither bulk nor shear modulus can be negative .",
    "for example , exerting a hydrostatic pressure onto a material with @xmath6 would lead to an expansion , further increasing the pressure , further increasing the volume , etc .",
    "this non - negativity together with equation ( [ b_g ] ) immediately translates into the well - known interval of possible poisson s ratios of @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "effectively isotropic auxetic materials with @xmath8 composed of disordered polymer- or metal - based foams have extensively been studied in the literature , for a recent review see ref.@xcite .",
    "it is not clear though how one would systematically approach , along these lines , the ultimate limit of @xmath9 .",
    "such ultimate extreme auxetic materials are called `` dilational '' because they support strictly no other modes than dilations .",
    "intuitively , for example , if one exerts a force onto a statue of liberty made of a dilational material at any point and along any direction , one can change its volume , but it will always maintain exactly the shape of the statue of liberty . obviously , this behavior is very much different from that of a regular elastic solid .",
    "as an impact would be distributed throughout the entire elastic structure , dilational materials can , for example , be used as shock absorbers @xcite .",
    "early three - dimensional auxetic metamaterials with anisotropic poisson s ratio have recently been presented @xcite .",
    "it is again not clear though how this approach @xcite could be brought towards an isotropic behavior with @xmath10 . in the literature , several conceptual models for dilational metamaterials",
    "have been discussed @xcite .",
    "these , however , contain elements like `` perfect joints '' and `` rigid rods '' that still need to be translated to a three - dimensional continuous microstructure composed of one constituent material ( and vacuum in the voids ) that can be fabricated with current technology . in this paper , inspired by the two - dimensional conceptual model of ref.@xcite",
    ", we introduce a three - dimensional blueprint for such a dilational material .",
    "several questions arise .",
    "does this microstructure support unwanted easy modes other than the wanted dilations ? can this microstructure at all be described by a simple elasticity tensor and a constant mass density ?",
    "for so - called cosserat materials or for materials with anisotropic mass - density tensors @xcite , the answer would be negative .",
    "our blueprint contains small internal connections mimicking the mentioned `` ideal joints '' .",
    "how small do these connections have to be ? the blueprint uses a simple - cubic translational lattice .",
    "do we really get an isotropic poisson s ratio ?",
    "in general cubic elastic solids , the answer would be negative . to address all of these questions , we start by presenting calculated phonon band structures for our blueprint .",
    "next , we compare these with static continuum - mechanics calculations .",
    "these can then directly be compared with our static experiments on macroscopic polymer - based metamaterials made by three - dimensional printing .",
    "finally , we show that also microscopic versions can be fabricated by recent advances in galvo - scanner dip - in direct - laser - writing optical lithography .",
    "a related but different idea has recently been demonstrated by a rubbery chartreuse ball with 24 carefully spaced round dimples @xcite .",
    "these buckliballs can also be arranged into bucklicrystals @xcite .",
    "our three - dimensional blueprint depicted in fig.1 is based on a recently published two - dimensional conceptual model @xcite .",
    "this model contains `` ideal joints '' and `` rigid bars '' . in our blueprint ,",
    "the ideal joints are implemented by small connections between the square and the triangular elements . upon pushing from one side , for example from the top , the inner squares rotate and the triangular outer connection elements get pulled inwards . thus , ideally , the structure contracts laterally by the same amount as it contracts vertically .",
    "the poisson s ratio would thus be @xmath10 .",
    "we will have to investigate though to what extend we approach this ideal for a finite connection size @xmath11 compared to the cubic lattice constant @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the very thin rigid bars in @xcite have been eliminated in our blueprint because they can not be implemented using a single constituent material . as a result , it is not clear whether unwanted easy modes of deformation might occur . indeed , in preliminary simulations",
    ", we have found that using only one sense of rotation of the squares , the squares do not only rotate around their center , but rather also translate . to eliminate this unwanted easy mode",
    ", we use a three - dimensional checkerboard arrangement with the discussed motif alternating with its mirror image . the small cubes with a side length identical to the thickness of all squares and triangles are not necessary for the function of the metamaterial .",
    "they are , however , crucial as markers in our measurements of the poisson s ratio ( see below ) .",
    "they are hence considered in all our band structure and static calculations to allow for direct comparison .    .",
    "the other parameters are : block size @xmath13 , width of the holding element @xmath14 , layer thickness @xmath15 , holder length @xmath16 , and connection size @xmath17 . ]",
    "the phonon band structure reveals all modes of the elastic metamaterial , possibly including unwanted easy modes other than dilations ( see above )",
    ". the long - wavelength limit of the band structure can be the starting point for a description in terms of effective elastic metamaterial parameters ( see next section ) . in our numerical band - structure calculations for the dilational metamaterial structure in fig.1",
    ", we solve the usual elastodynamic equations @xcite for the displacement vector @xmath18 containing the time - independent rank-4 elasticity tensor @xmath19 and the scalar mass density @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 by using a commercial software package ( comsol multiphysics , mumps solver ) .",
    "we impose bloch - periodic boundary conditions onto the primitive cubic real - space cell shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we have carefully checked that all results presented in this paper are converged .",
    "typically , convergence is achieved by using several ten thousand tetrahedra in one primitive real - space cell .",
    "we choose an isotropic polymer as constituent material with young s modulus @xmath22 , poisson s ratio @xmath23 , and mass density @xmath24 .",

    "it becomes immediately clear that the slope of the low - frequency or long - wavelength acoustic modes is not the same for all directions , it is anisotropic . along the @xmath30-direction ( i.e. , along the principal cubic axes ) , the velocity of the longitudinally polarized mode is smaller than that of the transversely polarized modes ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) . in isotropic",
    "elastic media , the opposite holds true . as to be expected , the phase velocities are larger for larger @xmath29 . we note in passing that the band structure in fig.[fig2 ] for @xmath26 exhibits a complete three - dimensional elastic ( i.e. , not only acoustic ) band gap between normalized frequencies of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this region with zero bulk phonon density of states corresponds to a gap - to - midgap ratio of @xmath33 .",
    "this complements other possibilities reported in the literature @xcite . to further emphasize the anisotropy , we also plot the phase velocity in polar diagrams in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "constant phase velocity would lead to circles in the two - dimensional cuts depicted . clearly , the curves shown in fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) are not circular at all , neither for the small nor for the large value of @xmath29 .",

    "<S> dilational materials are stable three - dimensional isotropic auxetics with an ultimate poisson s ratio of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we design , evaluate , fabricate , and characterize crystalline metamaterials approaching this ideal . </S>",
    "<S> to reveal all modes , we calculate the phonon band structures . on this basis , using cubic symmetry , we can unambiguously retrieve all different non - zero elements of the rank-4 effective metamaterial elasticity tensor , from which all effective elastic metamaterial properties follow . while the elastic properties and the phase velocity remain anisotropic , the effective poisson s ratio indeed becomes isotropic and approaches @xmath0 in the limit of small internal connections . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is also supported by independent static continuum - mechanics calculations . in static experiments on macroscopic polymer structures fabricated by three - dimensional printing , we measure poisson s ratios as low as @xmath1 in good agreement with theory . </S>",
