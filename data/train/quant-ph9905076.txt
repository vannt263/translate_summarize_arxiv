    "1 )    @xmath5    within the context of the new relativistic equation which had just been published by dirac@xcite .",
    "he found ( see section 2 below ) that the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath6 if @xmath7 was large were given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the kinematic factor @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the momentum of the transmitted particle for @xmath12 it is easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) that when @xmath13 , @xmath9 seems to be negative with the paradoxical result that the reflection coefficient @xmath14 while @xmath15 .",
    "so more particles are reflected by the step than are incident on it .",
    "this is what many articles and books call the klein paradox .",
    "it is not , however , what klein wrote down .",
    "klein noted that pauli had pointed out to him that for @xmath16 , the particle momentum is given by @xmath17 while the group velocity @xmath18 was given by    @xmath19    so if the transmitted particle moved from left to right , @xmath20 was positive implying that @xmath11 had to be assigned its negative value    @xmath21    with this choice of @xmath11    @xmath22    and @xmath23 ensuring that both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are positive or zero and satisfy @xmath26 for @xmath3 @xmath27 is there still a paradox ?",
    "the general consensus both now and for the authors who followed klein and did the calculation correctly is that there is .",
    "let the potential step @xmath28 for fixed @xmath29 then from eq .",
    "( [ kappa2])@xmath30 @xmath9 tends to a finite limit and hence @xmath25 tends to a non - zero limit .",
    "the physical essence of this paradox thus lies in the prediction that according to the dirac equation , fermions can pass through strong repulsive potentials without the exponential damping expected in quantum tunnelling processes .",
    "we have called this process klein tunnelling @xcite .",
    "we begin with a summary of the dirac equation in one dimension in the presence of a potential @xmath31 and show how klein s original result for @xmath32 and @xmath25 is obtained .",
    "we go on to the papers of sauter in 1931 , who replaced klein s potential step with a barrier with a finite slope , and then to hund in 1940 who realised that the klein potential step gives rise to the production of pairs of charged particles when the potential strength is sufficiently strong .",
    "this result although not well known is a precursor of the famous results of modern quantum field theory of schwinger @xcite and hawking @xcite which show that particles are spontaneously produced in the presence of strong electric and gravitational fields .",
    "in part ii we turn to the underlying physics of the klein paradox and show that particle production and klein tunnelling arise naturally in the dirac equation : when a potential well is deep enough it becomes supercritical ( defined as the potential strength for which the bound state energy @xmath33 and positrons will be spontaneously produced .",
    "supercriticality is well - understood @xcite , @xcite and can occur in the coulomb potential with finite nuclear size when the nuclear charge @xmath0 @xmath34 .",
    "positron production via this mechanism has been the subject of experimental investigations in heavy ion collisions for many years .",
    "we then show that if a potential well is wide enough , a steady but transient current will flow when the potential becomes supercritical . in order to analyse these processes",
    "it is necessary to introduce the concept of vacuum charge .",
    "we consider the implications of these concepts for the coulomb potential and for other physical phenomena and we end by pointing out that klein was unfortunate in that the example he chose to calculate was pathological .      in one - dimension",
    "it is unnecessary to use four - component dirac spinors .",
    "it is much easier to use two - component pauli spinors instead @xcite.we adopt the convention @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the above choice agrees with @xmath37 the free dirac hamiltonian in one dimension is @xmath38 and so the dirac equation takes the form @xmath39 in what follows @xmath40 stands for the wavevector , @xmath4 for its magnitude and @xmath41 .",
    "we try a plane wave of the form @xmath42 and substitute in ( [ frd ] ) .",
    "the equation is satisfied by @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the positive energy ( or particle ) solutions have the form @xmath45 and the negative energy ( or hole ) solutions are @xmath46 where @xmath47 are appropriate normalization factors .",
    "if we take the particle to be in a box of length 2@xmath48 with periodic boundary conditions at @xmath49 and @xmath50 we obtain    @xmath51    alternatively we can use continuum states and energy normalisation ; then    @xmath52      in the presence of the klein step , the hamiltonian is @xmath53 where @xmath31 is now given by eq.([step ] ) .",
    "the dirac equation reads @xmath54    consider an electron incident from the left .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction is @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57    for @xmath16 since that state is a hole state ( see fig .",

    "klein s surprising result was widely discussed by theoretical physicists at the time .",
    "bohr thought that the large transmission coefficient that klein found was because the klein step was so abrupt .",
    "he discussed this with heisenberg and sommerfeld and as a result sommerfeld s assistant sauter@xcite in munich calculated the transmission coefficient for a potential of the form    @xmath62    with @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in order to obtain negative energy states ( holes ) to propagate through the barrier as in the klein problem , we require @xmath67 .",
    "sauter s potential thus should reduce to the klein step if @xmath68 were very large .",
    "sauter s potential is of course more physical than klein s : it simply represents a constant electric field @xmath69 in a finite region of space .",
    "klein tunnelling in this case would imply that low energy electrons could pass through a repulsive constant electric field without exponential damping .",
    "bohr conjectured that the klein result would only be reproduced if the sauter field were so strong that the potential difference @xmath70 would be attained at distances of the order of the compton wavelength of the electron ; that is to say that the electric field strength @xmath71 .       after a lengthy calculation involving the appropriate hypergeometric functions",
    ", sauter obtained the result he was seeking : he obtained an expression for the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 which reduced to the klein values @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath74 nevertheless but for weaker fields he obtained    @xmath75    a non - paradoxical result since it shows the exponentially - suppressed tunnelling typical of quantum phenomena .",
    "what no one realised at the time is that sauter had anticipated schwingers@xcite result of quantum electrodynamics by twenty years ( see next section ) .",
    "note also that eq .",
    "( [ sautres ] ) shows explicitly that bohr s conjecture is correct : in order to violate the rule that tunnelling in quantum mechanics is exponentially suppressed we require electric fields of field strength @xmath76 .",
    "the next major contribution to the subject came ten years later .",
    "hund @xcite looked again at the klein step potential but from the viewpoint of quantum field theory , not just the one particle dirac equation .",
    "he concentrated on charged scalar fields rather than spinor fields .",
    "he considered both the klein step potential and a sequence of step potentials .",
    "his result was as surprising as klein s original result .",
    "hund found that provided @xmath70 where @xmath77 , then a non - zero constant electric current @xmath78 had to be present where the current was given by an integral over the transmission coefficient @xmath79 with respect to energy @xmath29 .",
    "the current had to be interpreted as spontaneous production out of the vacuum of a pair of oppositely charged particles .",
    "hund attempted to derive the same result for a spinor field but was unsuccessful : it was left to hansen and ravndal @xcite forty years later to generalise this result to spinors ( for a good discussion of the difference between scalar and spinor fields incident on a klein step see manogue@xcite ) .",
    "we show in the appendix for a klein step or more general step potential such as those considered by hund and sauter in the dirac equation that there is indeed a spontaneous current of electron - positron pairs produced given by    @xmath80    in agreement with hund s result for scalars .",
    "( [ pprod ] ) is very powerful : it is a sort of optical theorem .",
    "if spontaneous pair production occurs at a constant rate , then the time - independent reflection and transmission coefficients must incorporate this process .",
    "if sauter had known of eq .",
    "( [ pprod ] ) , he would have been able to predict schwinger s @xcite result on spontaneous pair production by a constant electric field simply by using the value of the transmission coefficient he had calculated in eq .",
    "( [ sautres ] ) .",
    "we now investigate the underlying physics behind these phenomena .",
    "why is it that electrons can tunnel so easily through a high potential barrier ? why are particles produced in strong potentials ?",
    "are these two questions the same question ; that is to say is the result that particles are produced by a klein step or other strong field the reason for klein tunnelling . to answer these questions",
    "we turn our attention to a potential barrier which is not the klein step but is similar and has better - defined properties .",
    "this is the square barrier ( fig .",
    "4 )    @xmath81    electrons incident from the left would not be expected to be able to distinguish between a wide barrier ( i.e. @xmath82 and a klein step .",
    "the results are in fact not identical but they do display the same characteristics .",
    "it is easy to show that the reflection and transmission coefficients are given for a square barrier by @xcite @xmath83    note that tunnelling is easier for a barrier than a step : if    @xmath84    corresponding to @xmath85 then the electron passes right through the barrier with no reflection : this is called a transmission resonance @xcite .",
    "as @xmath86 becomes very large for fixed @xmath87 and @xmath7 , @xmath88 becomes very large and @xmath89 oscillates very rapidly . in those circumstances we can average over the phase angle @xmath88 using @xmath90 to find the limit    @xmath91    it may seem unphysical that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are not the same as @xmath24 and @xmath25 but it is not",
    ": it is well known in electromagnetic wave theory @xcite that reflection off a transparent barrier of large but finite width ( with 2 sides ) is different from reflection off a transparent step ( with 1 side ) .",
    "the square barrier thus demonstrates klein tunnelling but it now arises in a more physical problem than the klein step .",
    "the zero of potential is properly defined for a barrier whereas it is arbitrary for a step and the energy spectrum of a barrier ( which attracts positrons ) or well ( which attracts electrons ) is easily calculable .",
    "particle emission from a barrier or well is described by supercriticality : the condition when the ground state energy of the system overlaps with the continuum ( @xmath94 for a barrier ; @xmath95 for a well ) and so any connection between particle emission and the time - independent scattering coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be investigated .",
    "we discussed the field theoretic treatment of this topic in a previous paper @xcite which we refer to as cdi .",
    "we quickly review the argument of that paper .",
    "spontaneous fermionic emission is a non - static process and in the case of a seemingly static potential , it is necessary to ask how the potential was switched on from zero .",
    "we follow cdi in turning on the potential adiabatically",
    ". we will consider the square well    @xmath96    but it is easiest to begin with the very narrow potential @xmath97 which is the limit of a square well with @xmath98 .",
    "the bound states are then very simple : for a given value of @xmath99 there is just one bound state corresponding to either the even @xmath100 or odd ( @xmath101 wave functions @xcite with energy given by    @xmath102    when the potential is initially turned on and",
    "@xmath99 is small the bound state is even and its energy @xmath29 is just below @xmath94 . as @xmath99 increases , @xmath29 decreases and at @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath29 reaches zero . for @xmath105 , @xmath29 becomes negative .",
    "assuming that we started in the vacuum state and therefore that the well was originally vacant , we now have for @xmath106 the absence of a negative energy state which must be interpreted as the presence of a ( bound ) positron according to dirac s hole theory .",
    "let @xmath99 increase further and @xmath29 decreases further until at @xmath107 @xmath95 which is the supercriticality condition .",
    "so for @xmath108 the bound positron acquires sufficient energy to escape from the well .",
    "this is the phenomenon of spontaneous positron production as described originally by gershtein and zeldovich @xcite and pieper and greiner @xcite .",
    "note that this picture requires that positrons ( as well as electrons ) are bound by potential wells when the potential strength is large enough : we return to this point later when we discuss the coulomb potential .",
    "how is it possible to conserve charge and produce positrons out of the vacuum ?",
    "this question has been a fruitful ground for theorists in recent years .",
    "the key point is that the definition of the vacuum state of the system ( and of the other states ) depends on the background potential : this leads to the concept of vacuum charge @xcite , @xcite . at this point",
    "a single particle interpretation of a potential in the dirac equation is insufficient and field theory becomes necessary ( as is also seen in the discussion of radiation from the klein step in the appendix ) .",
    "but nevertheless it turns out that once the concept of vacuum charge is introduced , first quantisation is all that is necessary to determine its value .",
    "we shall refer the reader to cdi for a proper treatment of vacuum charge ; we just write down the essential equations here",
    ".       the total charge is defined by ( according to our conventions the electron charge is @xmath1091 )   @xmath110   \\label{ch1}\\ ] ] writing the wave function @xmath111 in terms of creation and annihilation operators we eventually find that @xmath112 where the particle charge @xmath113 is an operator which counts the number of electrons in a state minus the number of positrons while the vacuum charge @xmath114 is just a number which is defined by the difference in the number of positive energy and negative energy states of the system : @xmath115 given the definition of the vacuum we immediately get @xmath116    we illustrate the use of the vacuum charge by returning to the delta function potential @xmath117 . for @xmath99 just larger than @xmath118 , @xmath119 because a positron has been created , but now the vacuum charge @xmath120 because the number of positive energy states has decreased by one while the number of negative energy states has increased by one .",
    "so the total charge @xmath121 is in fact conserved . as the potential",
    "is increased further , @xmath99 will reach @xmath122 where @xmath95 and the bound positron reaches the continuum and becomes free .",
    "note that at supercriticality , there is no change in vacuum charge ; the change occurs when @xmath29 crosses the zero of energy .",
    "note also that at supercriticality the even bound state disappears and the first odd state appears .",
    "we can continue to increase @xmath99 and count positrons : the total number of positrons produced for a given @xmath99 is the number of times @xmath29 has crossed @xmath123 that is @xmath124   \\label{charge0}\\ ] ]    and @xmath125 -@xmath113 where @xmath126 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath127 for positron emission the more interesting quantity is the number of supercritical positrons @xmath128 , that is the number of states which have crossed @xmath95 .",
    "this is given by    @xmath129\\ ] ]      we can now return to the case that we are interested in which is that of a wide well or barrier .",
    "so let us consider the general case of a square well potential of strength @xmath130 and then look at a wide well for which @xmath131 most closely corresponding to the klein step .",
    "we follow the discussion given in our papers cdi and cd @xcite .",
    "we must find first the condition for supercriticality and then the number of bound and supercritical positrons produced for a given @xmath132       the bound state spectrum for the well @xmath133 is easily obtained : there are even and odd solutions given by the equations    @xmath134    @xmath135    where now the well momentum is given by @xmath136 .",
    "we have changed the sign of @xmath7 so that it is now attractive to electrons rather than positrons in order to conform with other authors who have studied supercritical positron emission rather than electron emission .       from eq ( [ even ] )",
    "we see that the ground state becomes supercritical when @xmath137 and therefore @xmath138 from eq ( [ odd ] ) the first odd state becomes supercritical when @xmath139 and @xmath140 clearly the supercritical potential corresponding to the nth positron is    @xmath141    it follows from eq ( [ nth ] ) that @xmath142 is an accumulation point of supercritical states as @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore it is a threshold : a potential @xmath7 is subcritical if @xmath144 .",
    "it is not difficult to show for a given @xmath130 that the number of supercritical positrons is given by    @xmath145\\ ] ]    the corresponding value of the total positron charge @xmath113 can be shown using eqs ( [ even],[odd ] ) to satisfy    @xmath146\\leq q_p\\ ] ]    so for large @xmath86 we have the estimates    @xmath147    @xmath148    now we can build up an overall picture of the wide square well @xmath149 . when @xmath7 is turned on from zero in the vacuum state an enormous number of bound states is produced . as @xmath7 crosses @xmath3 a very large number @xmath150 of these states cross @xmath151 and become bound positrons .",
    "as @xmath7 crosses @xmath152 a large number @xmath128 of bound states become supercritical together .",
    "this therefore gives rise to a positively charged current flowing from the well .",
    "but in this case , unlike that of the klein step , the charge in the well is finite and therefore the particle emission process has a finite lifetime .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath153 large enough the transient positron current for a wide barrier is approximately constant in time for a considerable time as we shall see in the next section .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to the case @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "this is not necessary but it avoids having to calculate the dynamics of positron emission while the potential is still increasing beyond the critical value .",
    "we can assume all the positrons are produced almost instantaneously as the potential passes through @xmath156 it also means that the kinematics are non - relativistic .",
    "hence for a sufficiently wide",
    "well so that @xmath157 is large , @xmath158 .",
    "the well momentum of the nth supercritical positron is still given by eq ( [ quant ] ) @xmath159 which corresponds to an emitted positron energy latexmath:[$%    energies have discrete values although for @xmath86 large , they are closely spaced .",
    "the lifetime @xmath161 of the supercritical well is given by the time for the slowest positron to get out of the well .",
    "the slowest positron is the deepest lying state with @xmath162 and momentum @xmath163 .",
    "hence @xmath164 so the lifetime is finite but scales as @xmath165 .",
    "but a large number of positrons will have escaped well before @xmath161 .",
    "there are @xmath128 supercritical positrons initially and their average momentum @xmath166 corresponds to @xmath167 ; hence @xmath168 which is independent of @xmath86 .",
    "thus a transient current of positrons is produced which is effectively constant in time for a long time of order @xmath169 @xmath170 .",
    "we thus see that the square well ( or barrier ) for @xmath86 sufficiently large behaves just like the klein step : it emits a seemingly constant current with a seemingly continuous energy spectrum .",
    "but initially the current must build up from zero and eventually must return to zero .",
    "so the well / barrier is a time - dependent physical entity with a finite but long lifetime for emission of supercritical positrons or electrons .",
    "note again that the transmission resonances of the time - independent scattering problem coincide with the energies of particles emitted by the well or barrier .",
    "it is therefore tempting to use the pauli principle to explain the connection . following hansen and ravndal @xcite",
    ", we could say that @xmath72 must be zero at the resonance energy because the electron state is already filled by the emitted electron with that energy .",
    "but it is easy to show that the reflection coefficient is zero for bosons as well as fermions of that energy , and no pauli principle can work in that case .",
    "furthermore emission ceases after time @xmath161 whereas @xmath171 for times @xmath172 .",
    "it follows that we must conclude that klein tunnelling is a physical phenomenon in its own right , independent of any emission process .",
    "it seems that klein tunnelling is indeed distinct from the particle emission process : to show this is so we return to the square barrier to show that klein tunnelling occurs even when the barrier is subcritical .",
    "it is clear from eq ( [ barr ] ) that while the reflection coefficient @xmath72 for a square barrier can not be @xmath173 , neither is the transmission coefficient @xmath73 exponentially small for energies @xmath174 when @xmath175 even though the scattering is classically forbidden .",
    "the simplest way to understand this is to consider the negative energy states under the potential barrier as corresponding to physical particles which can carry energy in exactly the same way that positrons are described by negative energy states which can carry energy .",
    "it follows from eq ( [ rs / ts ] ) that @xmath32 and @xmath25 correspond to reflection and transmission coefficients in transparent media with differing refractive indices : thus @xmath9 is nothing more than an effective fermionic refractive index corresponding to the differing velocities of propagation by particles in the presence and absence of the potential . on this basis",
    ", tuning the momentum @xmath11 to obtain a transmission resonance for scattering off a square barrier is nothing more than finding the frequency for which a given slab of refractive material is tranparent .",
    "this is not a new idea . in jensen s words",
    " a potential hill of sufficient height acts as a fabry - perot etalon for electrons , being completely transparent for some wavelengths , partly or completely reflecting for others  @xcite",
    ".       we can now look in more detail at klein tunnelling : both in terms of our model square well / barrier problem and at the analogous coulomb problem .",
    "the interesting region is where the potential is strong but subcritical so that emission dynamics play no role and sensible time independent scattering parameters can be defined . for electron scattering off the square barrier",
    "@xmath176 we would thus require @xmath177 @xmath178 together with @xmath130 so that positrons can propagate under the barrier .",
    "for the corresponding square well @xmath179 there are negative energy bound states @xmath180 provided that @xmath181 @xmath182 [ cf .",
    "eq.([charge ] ) ] .",
    "so when the potential well is deep enough , it will in fact bind positrons .",
    "correspondingly , a high barrier will bind electrons .",
    "it is thus not surprising that electrons can tunnel through the barrier for strong subcritical potentials since they are attracted by those potential barriers .",
    "another way of seeing this phenomenon is by using the concept of effective potential @xmath183 which is the potential which can be used in a schrodinger equation to simulate the properties of a relativistic wave equation .",
    "for a potential @xmath31 introduced as the time - component of a four - vector into a relativistic wave equation ( klein - gordon or dirac ) , it is easy to see that @xmath184 hence as the energy @xmath29 changes sign , the effective potential can change from repulsive to attractive .       for the pure coulomb potential , it is well known that there is exponential suppression of the wave functions for a repulsive potential compared with an attractive potential .",
    "for example , if @xmath185 is the ratio of the probability of a positron penetrating a coulomb barrier to reach the origin compared with the probability of an electron of the same energy , then if the particles are non - relativistic @xmath186 where p and @xmath29 are the particle momenta and energies and this is exponentially small as @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "but if the particles are relativistic @xcite @xmath188 where @xmath189 is a ratio of complex gamma - functions and is approximately unity for large @xmath0 .",
    "so @xmath190 for @xmath191 which is not specially small although it still decreases exponentially with @xmath192       in order to demonstrate klein tunnelling for a coulomb potential we require first the inclusion of nuclear size effects so that the potential is not singular at @xmath193 and second that @xmath0 is large enough so that bound positron states are present .",
    "this means that @xmath0 must be below its supercritical value @xmath194 of around @xmath195 but large enough for the @xmath196 state to have @xmath197 .",
    "the calculations of references @xcite and @xcite which depend on particular models of the nuclear charge distribution give this region as @xmath198 which unfortunately will be difficult to demonstrate experimentally . nevertheless , the theory seems to be clear : in this subcritical region positrons should no longer obey a tunnelling relation which decreases exponentially with z such as that of eq .",
    "( [ rel ] ) .",
    "instead the coulomb barrier should become more transparent as @xmath199 increases , at least for low energies .",
    "by analogy with the square barrier we may expect that maximal transmission for positron scattering on a coulomb potential should occur around @xmath200 although the onset of supercriticality implies that time independent scattering quantities may no longer be well - defined .",
    "we are now carrying out further detailed calculations to clarify the situation for positron scattering off nuclei with @xmath0 near @xmath194 to see if we can simulate klein tunnelling .",
    "it seems that klein was very unfortunate in that the potential step he considered is pathological and therefore a misleading guide to the underlying physics .",
    "klein s step represents a limit in which time - dependent emission processes become time - independent and therefore a relationship between the emitted current and the transmission coefficient exists , as we show in the appendix . in general no direct relationship",
    "would exist between the transient current emitted and the time - independent transmission coefficient .",
    "the physics of the dirac equation which underlies klein s result is rich : it includes spontaneous fermionic production by strong potentials and the separate phenomenon of klein tunnelling by means of the negative energy states characteristic of relativistic wave equations , similar to interband tunnelling in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "spontaneous positron production due to supercriticality has not yet been unambiguously demonstrated experimentally in heavy ion collisions but experiments on superfluid @xmath1he - b@xcite , @xcite have displayed anomalous effects when the velocity of a body moving in the fluid exceeds the critical landau velocity @xmath201 .",
    "these experiments have now been interpreted in the same way as supercritical positron production@xcite .",
    "it may well be that fermionic many - body systems can be used to demonstrate the fundamental quantum processes which klein unearthed seventy years ago       we wo uld like to thank a. anselm , g barton , j d bjorken , b. garraway , r hall , l b okun , r laughlin , g e volovik and d waxman for advice and help .",
