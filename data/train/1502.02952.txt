    "damage phenomena in elastically deformable solids and their analytical studies have received a lot of attention in the mathematical literature , e.g. , @xcite . especially models which employ a phase field approach and incorporate higher - order terms were the focus in some recent works . in that case ,",
    "an internal variable indicates the degree of structural integrity and , depending on the material and the scaling , may be defined as the volume or the surface density of microvoids or microcracks , respectively , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this approach has also been utilized for approximations of surface discontinuities occurring in the displacement field of fracture models and turned out to be very useful for numerical implementations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main difficulty for a rigorous mathematical investigation of the underlying pde systems is that the damage variable is forced to be monotonically decreasing in time ( irreversibility ) and , if possible , bounded in the unit interval .",
    "this kind of non - smooth evolution had motivated different concepts of weak solutions and regularization techniques in the literature ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , to the authors best knowledge , a global - in - time well - posedness result for strong solutions with inhomogeneous boundary data was left open . together with sufficiently strong a priori estimates such a result",
    "could be exploited to study optimal control problems typically arising in engineering problems focused on resistance against damage and failure .",
    "the following model problems with boundary control illustrate some practical examples :    * suppose that a workpiece is exposed to external forces during an experiment and that certain parameters related to those forces can be controlled",
    ". a control problem could be to choose optimal parameters in order to prevent further damage in the material . *",
    "related to the first scenario we might be interested in calculating additional forces not to prevent but to redirect crack spreading to non - critical components of the structure and to avoid complete failure .",
    "* another problem might be the determination of external forces in order to deliberately induce a damage progression .",
    "for instance , it might be desirable to separate certain parts of the workpiece in industrial processes .    by now , to the authors best knowledge , the mathematical contributions addressing those and related problems are inspired by the pioneering work @xcite and employ fracture models to control the energy release rate of a single crack in a quasi - stationary setting by optimal shape design techniques , fibers or applied forces ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the cracks are explicitely modeled by non - smooth domains with or without non - penetration conditions for the deformation .",
    "a main issue consists in determining optimal forces or inclusions in the solid in order to cease crack propagation or to release as much energy as possible .    in this paper",
    "we would like to advance a different approach for such control problems by utilizing a phase field model for damage .",
    "the kind of model under consideration was motivated by fr ' emond and nedjar in @xcite and is stated below . under certain structural assumptions we are able to investigate well - posedness of strong solutions and existence of optimal boundary controls for a coupled evolutionary system describing damage processes in viscoelastic materials in two spatial dimensions .",
    "this enables us to investigate optimal control problems where we aim to control the damage phase field variable via external boundary forces .",
    "the cost functional will measure maximal deviations from desired phase field profiles .    in the first part of this paper we study existence and then , for constant viscosity @xmath0 , well - posedness of the following pde problem : + _ for a given time interval @xmath1 and reference configuration @xmath2 with boundary @xmath3 and outer unit normal @xmath4 , find @xmath5 such that _    [ eqn : pdesystem ] @xmath6    _ with the subgradient _",

    "we replace the subgradient @xmath57 in by a smooth approximation @xmath58 with @xmath59 . on the one hand",
    "this enables us to perform the a priori estimates in lemma [ lemma : aprioridiscr ] , while , on the other hand , the @xmath56-approximation might be helpful for further studies such as optimality systems , numerical implementations etc .",
    "we emphasize that the existence analysis constitutes the main part of this paper and strongly relies on the two - dimensional _ ladyzhenskaya s inequality _ originally devised for the @xmath60 navier - stokes equations ( see @xcite and the calculation ) . * continuous dependence on the data @xmath61 and , in particular , uniqueness of strong solutions for system - are proven in theorem [ theorem : contdepcont ] ( see also corollary [ cor : uniqueness ] ) under the assumption of constant viscosity @xmath0 .",

    "it is natural to ask if the reverse holds , i.e. , whether every optimal control for the original control problem can be approximated by a sequence of optimal controls of the @xmath56-approximating control problems .",
    "unfortunately , we will not be able to prove such a `` global result '' that applies to all optimal controls for the original control problem .",
    "the reason for that lies on the non - convexity of the optimal control problems ( both the original one and the @xmath56-approximating control problems ) and consequently on the non - uniqueness of the optimal controls .",
    "however , a `` local '' result can be established by introducing so - called adapted optimal control problems in theorem [ theorem : adaptedocp ] .",
    "let us recall some already established results in the mathematical literature of phase field models for damage / gradient - of - damage models :    * local - in - time well - posedness of strong solutions for damage - elasticity systems with scalar - valued displacements , homogeneous dirichlet conditions for the displacements and linear dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath0 on @xmath15 is proven in @xcite and in @xcite for one - dimensional models .",
    "since a degenerating elastic energy with respect to @xmath15 is considered and enhanced estimates are established for small times , the solutions are obtained locally in time . in the work @xcite",
    "such rate - dependent damage - elasticity system with the additional second order term @xmath64 has been coupled with an equation for heat conduction incorporating highly non - linear terms .",
    "existence , uniqueness and regularity results are established locally in time .",
    "* rate - independent gradient - of - damage models are explored in @xcite and in subsequent papers , e.g. , @xcite . in that case the corresponding dissipation potential @xmath65 is positive , convex , and positively - homogeneous of degree 1 . from the modeling point of view",
    "it means that the damage progression is considered on a faster timescale than the acting of the external forces .",
    "the authors considered non - smooth domains and employed weak notions referred to as _ energetic formulation _ in order to prove existence of solutions .",
    "the degenerating case where the material may loose all its elastic properties due to heavy damage is also studied .",
    "further cases involving nonlinear @xmath66-laplacians with @xmath67 or even @xmath68 instead of the classical laplacian in the damage equation are investigated in @xcite , where also higher temporal regularity is shown . * a weak notion for rate - dependent damage models coupled with cahn - hilliard equations was introduced in @xcite for quasi - static balance of forces and in @xcite with inertial effects and without the viscosity term in .",
    "existence of weak solutions is proven there for non - smooth domains and mixed - boundary conditions for the displacements whereas uniqueness is left open . *",
    "well - posedness and vanishing viscosity results for damage models with ( nonlocal ) higher - order @xmath69-laplacian are established in @xcite ( see also @xcite for vanishing viscosity results for damage models with a regularized nonlinear @xmath70-laplacian in non - smooth settings ) .",
    "the authors study both viscous ( rate - dependent ) and , via the vanishing viscosity limit , rate - independent pde systems for damage .",
    "existence of solutions is provided in both situations where in the latter case a novel energetic formulation making use of arc - length reparameterization in order to describe the behavior of the system at jumps is utilized .",
    "in particular , the existence results cover the case of the standard laplacian in two spatial dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the uniqueness problem has been solved under special conditions , where in the case of two or three spatial dimensions the @xmath69-laplacian is assumed to be of higher - order than the classical laplacian . *",
    "coupled thermoviscoelastic and isothermal damage models incorporating @xmath71-laplacian operators are analyzed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the full heat equation including all dissipative terms and @xcite for damage - dependent heat expansion coefficients ) . in those works homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions for the displacements are assumed .",
    "uniqueness is shown in the isothermal case by adopting @xmath72 and by dropping the irreversibility constraint .",
