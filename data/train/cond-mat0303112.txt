    "physically this embodies the fact that as @xmath203 , the kondo resonance in @xmath83 collapses at the qcp , leaving only the tails and producing a featureless @xmath83 that is no longer pinned to unity at the fermi level , @xmath204 . in this way @xmath83 ( and hence @xmath8 ) _ at _ the qcp is distinct from that _ approaching _ it , where @xmath205 is small but strictly non - zero and any rescaling in terms of it recovers eq.(8 ) ( and hence @xmath68 ) .",
    "the non-[g]fl , interacting nature of the fixed point @xcite is clearly evident ; embodied both in @xmath206 and , relatedly , in the @xmath173 behaviour @xmath207 ( eq.(11 ) with @xmath74 ) , whose decay to zero with the same power as the hybridization vitiates the necessary condition @xcite for adiabatic continuity to the non - interacting limit and hence a gfl state .    in summary",
    "we have considered a local moment approach to the pseudogap anderson model close to the symmetric quantum critical point ; focusing on @xmath28 single - particle dynamics , in which the collapse of the kondo resonance as the qcp is approached is directly manifest ( the present approach does not enable us to handle on a comparable footing the local magnetic susceptibility @xmath208 considered in @xcite ) .",
    "local impurity spectra close to the qcp have been shown to exhibit scaling in terms of a low - energy scale , @xmath191 - 1|^{1/r}$ ] for small @xmath100 , that vanishes as the qcp is approached from either phase ; and scaling spectra in both phases have been obtained analytically .",
    "the situation is summarised in fig .",
    "2 , representing a natural complement to the conventional picture in the ( @xmath209,@xmath1)-plane that schematises the crossover behaviour of static properties in the vicinity of a qcp @xcite . here by contrast , crossovers in dynamics are exemplified in the ( @xmath210,@xmath1)-plane at @xmath28 : for @xmath211 the low - energy spectral characteristics of the gfl and lm phases are distinct , while for @xmath212 each reduces to the _ common _ form @xmath213 ; such that the latter behaviour , precisely that of the qcp itself , ever increasingly dominates the dynamics of either phase as the transition is approached and @xmath214 vanishes .",
    "the pseudogap aim is itself a paradigm for understanding generic aspects of local quantum phase transitions , see e.g.  [ 11 - 13 ] ; and we are currently extending our approach to encompass the asymmetric case and the influence of a local magnetic field ."
