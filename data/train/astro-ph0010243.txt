    "globular clusters are rich sources of radio pulsars . since the discovery of the first pulsar in a cluster by @xcite , a series of deep searches have accumulated almost 50 pulsars in globular clusters , with the majority of these being binary millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for reviews .",
    "fruchter & goss ( 1990 ; 2000 , hereafter fg00 ) used the very large array ( vla ) to detect steep - spectrum radio sources , which are likely pulsars , in numerous globular clusters .",
    "they discovered a relatively bright point - like source within @xmath3 of the optical center of cluster ngc6544 ( @xmath4mjy at 20 cm and @xmath5mjy at 90 cm ) . @xcite searched ngc6544 at 50 cm as part of a survey of globular clusters and found no pulsars down to a limiting flux density of @xmath6mjy .",
    "it has been argued that doppler smearing from orbital motion could explain the lack of detection of pulsations from the pulsar - like sources found in vla surveys ( fg00 ) .",
    "the sensitivities of observations whose durations exceed even a few percent of the orbital period may be drastically reduced for traditional analyses @xcite .",
    "various schemes have been developed to correct , at least partially , for this loss of sensitivity when the doppler effect of the orbital motion can be approximated as a constant frequency derivative ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these `` acceleration '' searches have met with significant success , including the discovery of nine new binary msps in the globular cluster 47  tucanae @xcite .",
    "we have discovered a binary msp in ngc6544 using fourier - domain techniques to correct for pulsar orbital motion .",
    "this pulsar is almost certainly the radio source reported by fg00 near the center of the cluster .",
    "results from our single observation indicate that this object shares many of the properties displayed by the burgeoning class of eclipsing binary msps .",
    "these systems are characterised by short orbital periods ( @xmath7hours ) and very low - mass companions ( @xmath8 )  @xcite . @xcite",
    "independently discovered this pulsar and report the results of follow - up observations .",
    "we observed ngc6544 , a dense core - collapsed globular cluster , on 1998 february  7 with the multibeam data acquisition system on the parkes radio telescope in australia .",
    "signals from each of two orthogonal linear polarizations were measured and summed from 256 contiguous 0.25mhz wide channels centered at 1332mhz .",
    "each channel was one - bit sampled at 8khz and written to magnetic tape .",
    "the full observation comprised 28.9 minutes of data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss the observing system in detail .    since no pulsars were known in this cluster before our observation , we searched a wide range of possible dispersion measures ( dms ) for candidate signals .",
    "we dedispersed the data into time series of 13865600 points using 600 trial dms from 0 to 600pc@xmath9 , in increments of 1pc@xmath9 .",
    "this stepsize allowed a worst - case dispersion smearing over our bandwidth of @xmath10ms .",
    "after barycentering the data using the jpl  de200 ephemeris @xcite , we performed a fast fourier transform ( fft ) on each time series and saved the resultant spectra to disk .",
    "traditional time - domain acceleration searches are performed by stretching or compressing a time series to compensate for a constant frequency derivative and then fourier transforming the resulting series .",
    "we have developed a fourier - domain acceleration search ( s.  ransom & s. eikenberry 2000 , in preparation ) to compute the coherent fourier response over portions of the frequency  frequency derivative ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) plane using only local fourier amplitudes from an fft of the whole dataset .",
    "similar techniques were described in @xcite .",
    "the method correlates a predicted fourier response with a subset of the complex fourier amplitudes in the initial full - length fft .",
    "we effectively apply a matched filter to the data which `` sweeps up '' all of the signal power that the orbital motion spreads over nearby frequency bins .",
    "fourier - domain acceleration searches offer several significant advantages over their time - domain counterparts :    1 .",
    "fourier methods do not require stretching or compressing the time series .",
    "time - domain stretching or compressing is usually performed using linear interpolation , which changes the statistics of the data .",
    "portions of the data are effectively two - bin averaged which decreases sensitivity to high frequency signals .",
    "time - domain techniques require a full - length fft for each trial acceleration .",
    "for very long integrations ( which are common in cluster searches ) that do not fit into the computer s core memory , ffts take orders - of - magnitude more time to compute than usual ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fourier technique requires only a single full - length fft for each observation ( or trial dm ) .",
    "correlations using only localized fourier amplitudes are fast and memory efficient .",
    "the correlations can always be performed in core memory and are calculated efficiently using short ffts and pre - computed response templates .",
    "the memory locality also allows efficient parallelization of fourier - domain searches .",
    "4 .   the fourier - domain method allows the calculatation of only independent @xmath11@xmath12  trials . with time - domain techniques , as described by @xcite , any choice of acceleration stepsize results in either under- or over - sampling accelerations for the vast majority of frequencies searched .",
    "this amounts to loss of sensitivity or wasted cpu cycles respectively .",
    "a small amount of over - sampling can be incorporated to eliminate `` scalloping '' in both the @xmath11 and @xmath12  directions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we performed fourier - domain acceleration searches on each of the long ffts looking for signals that drifted by up to 100 fourier frequency bins during the observation .",
    "if we define @xmath13 to be the number of fourier bins that the pulsar frequency ( @xmath14 ) drifts over the course of an integration , the corresponding average acceleration of the pulsar is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the total integration time . for this observation ,",
    "a frequency drift of 100 fourier bins corresponds to an acceleration of 500ms@xmath17 for a 10hz signal or 5ms@xmath17 for a 1000hz signal . since most known binary pulsars show maximal accelerations of only a few ms@xmath17 , we were sensitive to all but the most exotic binaries or pulsars with spin periods ( @xmath18 ) much less than @xmath19ms .",
    "pulse profiles of strong candidates were folded at a series of trial dms , frequencies , and frequency derivatives around the acceleration search values in order to maximize the signal - to - noise .      an @xmath20 ( single trial ) detection of the 1.7hour binary psr  j1807@xmath212459  in the globular cluster ngc6544 using a fourier - domain `` acceleration '' search .",
    "contour intervals correspond to 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , and 150 times the average local power level .",
    "the intrinsic pulsar period and @xmath22 ( which corresponds to an un - accelerated fft of the data ) are marked by the solid black lines .",
    "the dashed line is the predicted `` path '' of the pulsar given the orbital solution in table  1 . during the 28.9minute observation ,",
    "the pulsar moved from @xmath23 oclock to @xmath24 oclock on the ellipse .",
    "the peak s slight offset from the ellipse and the presence of `` shoulders '' indicate that the constant @xmath12   assumption of the acceleration search could not fully correct for the orbital motion during this observation .",
    "we detected a strong pulsar candidate ( power / average local power @xmath25 corresponding to a single trial significance of @xmath20 ) at a dm of 134pc@xmath9 .",
    "the average frequency was 326.85895hz and the signal had drifted by 8.6 fourier bins ( @xmath26ms@xmath17 ) during the observation ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "search techniques that do not account for acceleration would have detected the signal at about @xmath27 times the average local power level , corresponding to an @xmath28 detection .",
    "optimization of the candidate by pulse - folding produced a narrow pulsar - like profile at a localized maximum in dm of 134pc@xmath9 indicating that the signal was almost certainly not due to terrestrial interference .",
    "the @xcite free - electron model gives an estimated distance of 3.3kpc ( @xmath29% error ) for this dm in the direction of ngc6544 , in fair agreement with the published cluster distance of @xmath30kpc obtained by fitting the mean _ v _  magnitudes of horizontal branch stars @xcite .",
    "we estimated a pulsar flux density at 1332mhz of @xmath2mjy by comparing the integrated pulsed flux and observed noise to the predicted system noise level given a system sensitivity and total system temperature of @xmath31 .",
    "the multibeam system has a cold - sky @xmath32k and a sensitivity of 1.36jyk@xmath33 .",
    "@xcite measured a sky temperature at 408  mhz in the direction of ngc6544 of @xmath34k . assuming a spectral index of @xmath35 , which is typical for this region @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath36k and @xmath37k at 1332mhz .",
    "fg00 reported a 20 cm flux density of @xmath4mjy and a spectral index of @xmath38 between 90 cm and 20 cm which corresponds to a flux density of @xmath39mjy at 1332mhz .",
    "our measured flux density agrees with that of fg00 within the errors , suggesting that the pulsar may be the previously unidentified point source near the core of ngc6544 .",
    "since the dm - based distance estimate for the pulsar matches published values for ngc6544 , cluster membership is very likely .",
    "the relatively large signal acceleration indicates that the pulsar is in a short period binary with a low - mass companion .",
    "these systems , almost without exception , have eccentricities very near to zero due to tidal circularization ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .      orbital fit for psr  j1807@xmath212459  assuming an eccentricity of zero .",
    "the error - bars plotted are @xmath40 uncertainties in the pulse arrival times .",
    "an eclipse , if present , should occur near true anomaly@xmath41 , which corresponds to superior conjunction",
    ". the apparent lack of an eclipse could be due to the relatively high observing frequency ( 1332mhz ) .",
    "the inset plot shows the observed pulse profile after folding with the best - fit orbital ephemeris and pulsar frequency .",
    "the error - bar indicates @xmath40 uncertainties in the profile values .     ",
    "error ellipses ( from inner to outer of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) for the orbital period and semi - major axis of psr  j1807@xmath212459 .",
    "the large covariance is due to the fact that the observation covered only @xmath45 of the orbital period . in order to study the assumption that the pulsar is a member of a low - mass binary with an eccentricity of zero",
    ", we split the observation into 16 equal - length parts and folded the data in each at the nominal pulsar frequency .",
    "we determined phase offsets for each of the pulse arrival times and performed a levenberg - marquardt least - squares fit of a circular orbit ( i.e. sinusoid ) to the phase offsets .",
    "the results are tabulated in table  1 and the residuals and error ellipses of the fit are shown in figures  2 and 3 respectively .",

    "each of these systems displays a pulse period of a few milliseconds , an orbital period of 1 - 10hours , and a very low - mass companion ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "* for a review ) using an exchange interaction between a neutron star ( ns ) and a hard primordial binary containing at least one relatively massive main sequence ( ms ) star ( @xmath57 1 - 3_@xmath50 ) .",
    "if the exchange interaction results in a binary containing the ns and the massive ms star , the system enters a common - envelope ( ce ) phase once the ms star evolves and fills its roche lobe . at the end of the ce phase ,",
    "the ns emerges with a very low - mass companion in a very short period circular orbit .",
    "systems with orbital periods @xmath58hours undergo evolution due to gravitational radiation and enter a second phase of mass transfer that spins the ns up to millisecond periods .",
    "the scenario described by @xcite is possible only if the exchange interactions occurred at a time when massive ms stars were still present in the cluster .",
    "the nss and primordial binaries must also have undergone mass segregation and ended up near the cluster core before the ms stars evolved .",
    "the timescale for mass segregation is the half - mass relaxation time , which for ngc6544 is @xmath59myr @xcite .",
    "this is significantly less than the ms lifetime of a 1 - 3_@xmath50  star and implies that this scenario may have produced psr  j1807@xmath212459 .",
    "alternatives to `` spin - up '' models exist in which the ns is created either by accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf ( wd ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the coalescence of a pair of massive wds @xcite .",
    "pairs of primordial binaries interact to produce hard binaries which contain a massive wd or wds that these models require .",
    "the nss that result from these models are born spinning rapidly ( @xmath60ms ) , have relatively weak ( @xmath61 g ) magnetic fields characteristic of msps , and may have low - mass companions in very short period orbits .",
    "interestingly , these systems could be the progenitors of the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) rather than their descendants @xcite .",
    "future observations of psr  j1807@xmath212459  will lead to improved measurements of rotational and orbital parameters , an estimate of or upper limit to the orbital eccentricity , and perhaps information about the circumstellar medium if eclipses are detected .",
    "@xcite predict that many similar systems must exist in the globular cluster system  some with orbital periods as short as @xmath62min .",
