    "the theory of combinatorial limits keeps attracting a growing amount of attention .",
    "combinatorial limits have sparked many exciting developments in extremal combinatorics , in theoretical computer science , and other areas .",
    "their significance is also evidenced by a recent monograph of lovsz  @xcite . the better understood case of convergence of dense structures originated in the series of papers by borgs , chayes , lovsz , ss , szegedy , and vesztergombi  @xcite on the dense graph convergence , and the notion was applied in various settings including hypergraphs , partial orders , permutations , and tournaments  @xcite .",
    "the convergence of sparse structures ( such as graphs with bounded maximum degree ) referred to as the benjamini - schramm convergence  @xcite is less understood despite having links to many problems of high importance .",
    "for example , the conjecture of aldous and lyons  @xcite on benjamini - schramm convergent sequences of graphs is essentially equivalent to gromov s question of whether all countable discrete groups are sofic .",
    "other notions of convergence of sparse graphs were also proposed and studied @xcite .    in the light of many results on the convergence of graphs",
    ", one can ask whether a reasonable theory of matroid convergence can be developed .",
    "the first obstacle to building such a theory comes from the fact that matroids when viewed as hypergraphs ( e.g.  with edges being the bases ) can be too sparse for the classical dense convergence approach to be directly applied , and too dense for the sparse convergence approach at the same time .",
    "for example , the number of bases of the graphic matroid of @xmath0 is @xmath1 , an exponentially small fraction of all @xmath2-element subsets of the edge set of @xmath0 and an even tinier fraction of all subsets of the edge set , which rules out the dense convergence approach . on the other hand , each element of this matroid is contained in a non - constant number of bases , and it is impossible to follow the sparse convergence approach .",
    "we overcome this obstacle by adapting the notion of the first order convergence to matroids .",
    "the notion of the first order convergence was introduced by neetil and ossona de mendez  @xcite as an attempt to unify the convergence notions in the dense and sparse settings : a sequence of structures of a fixed type ( e.g. ,  graphs ) is _ first order convergent _ if the probability that a random @xmath3-tuple of its elements has a first order property @xmath4 , converges for every choice of @xmath4 ( a formal definition can be found in subsection  [ subsect - fo ] ) .",
    "it holds that every first order convergent sequence of dense structures is convergent in the dense sense and every first order convergent sequence of sparse structures is convergent in the benjamini - schramm sense .    in the analogy to graphons in the setting of dense graphs and graphings in the setting of sparse graphs , an analytic limit object called a",
    "limit modeling _ was proposed in  @xcite to represent asymptotic properties of first order convergent sequences .",
    "unlike in the dense and sparse graph settings , it is not true that every first order convergent sequence of graphs has a limit modeling .",
    "for example , the sequence of erds - rnyi random graphs @xmath5 for @xmath6 is first order convergent with probability one but it has no limit modeling ( * ? ? ? * lemma 18 ) . in the same paper , neetil and",
    "ossona de mendez showed the following .",
    "[ thm - treedepth ] every first order convergent sequence of graphs with bounded tree - depth has a limit modeling .",
    "this result was extended to first convergent sequences of trees and graphs of bounded path - width  @xcite .",

    ", it seems natural to prove the analogue of theorem  [ thm - treedepth ] , which is actually one of our results ( theorem  [ thm - branchdepth ] ) . on the way towards theorem  [ thm - branchdepth ] , we need to find a matroid parameter that can play the role of the graph tree - depth .",
    "we do so by introducing a parameter called branch - depth in section  [ sect - branch - depth ] .",
    "we believe that this matroid parameter is the right analogue of the graph tree - depth because it has the following properties , which we establish in this paper .",
    "we refer the reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) for a thorough discussion of the graph tree - depth .    *",
    "the branch - depth of a matroid corresponding to a graph @xmath7 is at most the tree - depth of @xmath7 . *",
    "the branch - depth of a matroid corresponding to a graph @xmath7 with tree - depth @xmath8 is at least @xmath9 if @xmath7 is @xmath10-connected . *",
    "the branch - depth is a minor monotone parameter ( the same holds for graph tree - depth ) . *",
    "the branch - depth of a matroid is at most the square of the length of its longest circuit ( recall that the tree - depth of a graph @xmath7 is at most the length of its longest path ) . *",
    "the branch - depth of a matroid is at least the binary logarithm of the length of its longest circuit ( recall that the tree - depth of a graph @xmath7 is at least the binary logarithm of the length of its longest path ) .",
    "in addition , there exists an efficient algorithm that given an integer @xmath8 and an oracle - represented input matroid either outputs its decomposition of bounded depth or it determines that the branch - depth of the input matroid exceeds @xmath8 .",
    "equipped with the notion of branch - depth , we prove the following theorem in section  [ sect - modeling ] .",
    "[ thm - branchdepth ] every first order convergent sequence of matroids with bounded branch - depth that is representable over a fixed finite field has a limit matroid modeling .",
    "note that matroids representable over finite fields have a structure more similar to graphs than general matroids and it is not surprising that theorem  [ thm - branchdepth ] includes this assumption .",
    "in fact , we show in section  [ sect - non - exist ] that neither the assumption on the bounded branch - depth nor the assumption on the representability over a fixed finite field can be dropped .",
    "in particular , we construct a first order convergent sequence of binary matroids that has no limit modeling , and a first order convergent sequence of rank three matroids representable over rationals that has no limit modeling .",

    "<S> the model theory based notion of the first order convergence unifies the notions of the left - convergence for dense structures and the benjamini - schramm convergence for sparse structures . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that every first order convergent sequence of graphs with bounded tree - depth can be represented by an analytic limit object called a limit modeling . </S>",
    "<S> we establish the matroid counterpart of this result : every first order convergent sequence of matroids with bounded branch - depth representable over a fixed finite field has a limit modeling , i.e. , there exists an infinite matroid with the elements forming a probability space that has asymptotically the same first order properties . </S>",
    "<S> we show that neither of the bounded branch - depth assumption nor the representability assumption can be removed . </S>"
