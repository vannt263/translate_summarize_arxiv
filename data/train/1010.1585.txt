    "the waterfall phenomenon observed in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy on cuprate superconductors has attracted some attention .",
    "this phrase summarizes the following phenomenology @xcite : for photon energies around @xmath2 , where photoholes are created predominantly in o2p states@xcite , a quasiparticle band can be seen dispersing away from the fermi energy as @xmath3 is approached but then - along the @xmath4 direction roughly at @xmath5 - rapidly looses intensity and can not be resolved anymore . instead there is a band of weak intensity which seems to drop almost vertically in @xmath0 space towards higher binding energy , thus creating the impression of a kink in the quasiparticle band .",
    "up to binding energies of @xmath6 there is a black region around the @xmath3-point with no spectral weight at all .",
    "finally , at binding energies of around @xmath7 the waterfall seems to merge with one or several bands of high intensity , which often correspond very well to bands predicted by lda calculations .",
    "+ in experiments with photon energies @xmath8 ( where an appreciable fraction of the photoholes is created in cu3d states@xcite ) and when the spectra are taken in higher brillouin zones@xcite , however , the low energy quasiparticle band can be resolved all the way to @xmath3 and shows no indication of a kink .",
    "this band therefore undoubtedly exists and has no kink so that the only possible explanation for the black region and the apparent kink seen at low photon energies are matrix element effects .",
    "this conclusion has in fact been reached by inosov _",
    "_ on the basis of their experimental data@xcite .",
    "a very similar conclusion was also reached by zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite who showed that the kink in the quasiparticle band appears only in the second derivative of the momentum distribution curves but is absent in the second derivative of the energy distribution curves which shows a smooth quasiparticle band instead .",
    "they concluded that the kink is not an intrinsic band dispersion .",
    "+ some support for this point of view comes from the fact that the waterfall phenomenon is observed over the whole doping range , from the antiferromagnetic insulator to the fermi - liquid - like overdoped compounds , so that it is obviously unrelated to any special features of the electronic structure .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of a hole in an antiferromagnetic insulator is one of the very few reasonably well - understood problems in connection with cuprate superconductors .",
    "for this special problem good agreement between experiment@xcite , various approximate calculations@xcite , and exact diagonalization of small clusters@xcite has been found and no theory for hole motion in an antiferromagnet predicts a kink in the quasiparticle band . here in particular the work of leung and gooding@xcite should be mentioned who studied the spectral function for a single hole in a @xmath9-site cluster by exact diagonalization and found a well - defined and smooth quasiparticle band in excellent agreement with the results of the self - consistent born approximation@xcite .",
    "moreover , since plasmons with energies below the charge transfer gap are not expected in the insulating compound and since the coupling to spin excitations is obviously described very well by the self - consistent born approximation , a hypothetic bosonic mode can be almost certainly ruled out as an explanation of the waterfall phenomenon in the undoped compounds and , due to the near - independence of the phenomenon on the doping level , also for the entire doping range .",
    "+ one type of matrix - element effect which partly explains the nonobservation of the quasiparticle band at @xmath3 has been discussed by ronning _",
    "et al._@xcite . at the @xmath3-point in the first brillouin zone",
    "the photoelectrons are emitted exactly perpendicular to the cuo@xmath1 plane which we take as the @xmath10-plane of the coordinate system .",
    "in this situation - and if we neglect small deviations from this symmetry in the actual crystal structure - the experimental setup has @xmath11 symmetry . the expression for the photocurrent@xcite involves the dipole matrix element @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the vector potential of the incoming light , @xmath14 is the momentum operator , @xmath15 the initial and @xmath16 the final state .",
    "the state @xmath16 differs from @xmath15 by + a ) the presence of an electron in the so - called leed state , which far from the surface evolves into a plane wave @xmath17 and hence transforms according to the identical representation + b ) by the presence of a hole with momentum @xmath18 in a zhang - rice singlet .",
    "since the zhang - rice singlet has a cu3d@xmath19 orbital as its nucleus@xcite it has the same symmetry .",
    "+ it follows that @xmath16 and @xmath15 have the same parity under reflection in the @xmath20 plane so that the dipole matrix element is zero if @xmath13 is in the cuo@xmath1 plane . on the other hand @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath15 aquire a relative minus - sign under a rotation by @xmath21 around the @xmath22-axis so that the dipole matrix element is zero as well if @xmath13 is perpendicular to the cuo@xmath1 plane .",
    "this means that it is impossible to observe a state with the character of a zhang - rice singlet at @xmath3 in normal emission . as ronning _",
    "_ pointed out , however , this argument can not explain the nonobservation of the quasiparticle band at @xmath3 in higher brillouin zones , where the photoelectrons are no longer emitted in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "+ moreover , a similar effect has been observed in arpes studies of the compound srcuo@xmath1 which contains cuo chains . with a photon energy of @xmath23 and polarization parallel to the chains - which generates holes in @xmath24-bonding o2p orbital - there is no intensity at @xmath25@xcite . if the photon energy is increased to @xmath26 , however , the spinon - band around @xmath25 can indeed be resolved@xcite .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the waterfall effect but in this compound the cuo@xmath1 plaquettes are perpendicular to the surface of the crystal .",
    "we conclude that there must be a second mechanism for the extinction of spectral weight around @xmath3 in both , the one and two dimensional systems . + an explanation of the waterfall phenomenon has been given by basak _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "these authors first showed that the waterfall phenomenon can not be reproduced by a calculation of arpes spectra from lda band structures and eigenfunctions alone , a procedure which has otherwise been found to be highly successful in describing arpes spectra of cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "instead , these authors obtained good agreement with experiment by additionally introducing a self - energy which describes the coupling to a bosonic mode .",
    "the basic mechanism for the waterfall and the variation of the arpes spectra with photon energy then is bilayer splitting which is enhanced by the coupling to the bosonic mode , in particular the vertical part of the waterfall turns out to be the strongly renormalized bonding combination of the two single - layer wave functions .",
    "this model reproduces the strong changes of arpes spectra with photon energy @xmath27 in the range @xmath28 as observed by inosov _",
    "et al._@xcite quite well .",
    "on the other hand , inosov _ et al .",
    "_ gave a different explanation for this variation , namely the rapid variation of the cu3d photoemission intensity at the cu @xmath29 absorption threshold at @xmath30 .",
    "since the strong variation of photoemission spectra at the @xmath29 threshold is well established for 3d transition metal oxides@xcite this appears a plausible explanation .",
    "+ there have been attempts to reproduce a kink in the band structure within the framework of a single - band hubbard or t - j model@xcite .",
    "the high - intensity bands observed near @xmath3 at binding energies of @xmath6 thereby are identified with high energy features observed previously in exact diagonalization@xcite or quantum monte - carlo@xcite studies for such models .",
    "+ in the present manuscript we take the point of view that the waterfall phenomenon is a pure matrix - element effect , as pointed out by inosov _",
    "et al._@xcite and zhang _ et al._@xcite .",
    "thereby the crucial point is the nature of the low - energy hole states as zhang - rice singlets .",
    "since the phases of the o2p hole within a zhang - rice singlet correspond to momentum @xmath31@xcite there is perfect destructive interference with the phases of a p - like photohole with momentum @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 integer .",
    "the quasiparticle band at @xmath3 therefore can be observed only at photon energies where the cross section for hole creation in @xmath35-orbitals is large - because the destructive interference occurs only for o2p - photoholes - and in higher brillouin zones where the argument by ronning _",
    "et al._@xcite does not apply .",
    "+ in section ii we will discuss exact diagonalization results for a 1-dimensional charge transfer model . in section iii",
    "we discuss the spectra of a 2-dimensional charge transfer model by the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) . in section",
    "iv we discuss the experimental relevance of the binding energy of the zhang - rice singlet and section v gives summary and conclusions .",
    "we study a 1-dimensional ( 1d ) charge transfer model by exact diagonalization . we choose a 1d model",

    "we choose @xmath43 as the unit of energy and use the values @xmath44 and @xmath45 throughout .",

    "also , the energy of the @xmath41-like peak agrees exactly with that of the @xmath41-orbital , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "+ surprisingly the @xmath41-like band can be identified also in the strongly correlated case , particularly so near @xmath25 .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath41-like bloch state with @xmath25 does not mix with the @xmath35-like bloch state due to parity so that a hole created in this state is unaffected by the coulomb repulsion on the @xmath35-sites .",
    "accordingly , the energy of this peak still is @xmath56 .",
    "this state is analogous to the 1 ev - peaks in the real cuprate materials@xcite .",
    "near @xmath25 the mixing still is small so that @xmath57 is effectively only a weak perturbation .",
    "+ on the other hand the upper band of predominant @xmath35-character disappears completely and is replaced by a spectrum which is very similar to that of a 1d single - band hubbard model .",

    "it turns out that for the above values of @xmath43 , @xmath57 and @xmath61 a very good match can be obtained by choosing the parameters of the single - band hubbard model to be @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "there is a rather obvious one - to - one correspondence between the peaks , the different holon bands characteristic for the spectra of finite clusters of the one - dimensional hubbard or t - j model@xcite can be identified in both spectra .",
    "the main difference occurs at energies @xmath62 between @xmath63 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is most likely the consequence of mixing and level repulsion between the single - band hubbard - like bands and the free - electron - like @xmath41 band .",

    "this indicates that the zhang - rice construction@xcite for reduction of the low - energy sector of the two - band model to a single band model also works well for this 1d model . on the other hand , for higher energies",
    "the 2-band model has additional states which correspond to the non - bonding combination of @xmath41-orbitals .",
    "+ figure [ fig4 ] shows the photoemission spectrum of the two - band model split into its @xmath41- and @xmath35-component .",
    "this demonstrates that the key features@xcite of the waterfall phenomenon can be seen already in this simple 1d model : near @xmath3 there is no @xmath41-like intensity in the single - band hubbard - like states , instead all @xmath41-like intensity resides in the free - electron - like band ( this is the huge peak at @xmath64 ) .",
    "the @xmath41-like intensity alone therefore shows the black region around @xmath25 and a high - energy - kink whereby the vertical part of the waterfall is due to the incoherent continuum of the single - particle spectrum of the single - band hubbard model . in the @xmath35-like spectrum on the other hand",
    "the quasiparticle band can be followed right up to the @xmath3-point .",
    "already this simple model therefore reproduces the key features of the waterfall phenomenon and the photon energy dependence of the spectra : the waterfall occurs in the first brillouin zone for all photon energies and in higher brillouin zones for photon energies where the cross section for cu3d is small .",

    "this corresponds to the binding energy of the zrs and has no counterpart in the single - band model . in simplest terms",
    ", we would therefore expect that the photoemission part of single particle spectral functions of the two - band model can be obtained from that of the single band model by @xmath83 in this expression several simplifications have been made : the zrs is assumed to extend only over one plaquette , which is probably not correct .",
    "this implies that processes where a zrs in a plaquette around site @xmath40 is generated by actually creating a hole in a neighboring unit cell are neglected .",

    "the main differences occur for larger @xmath80-values and may also be due to the fact that the zrs is not restricted to one plaquette and also the hybridization with the @xmath41-like band which is absent in the single - band hubbard model . on the other hand , given the simplicity of the procedure for converting the single - band spectra into two - band spectra this not so bad and qualitatively explains the extinction of @xmath41-like intensity around @xmath3 at least qualitatively : this is due to the factor of @xmath91 in the matrix element @xmath92 , which describes the destructive interference between the phase factors of the two @xmath41-orbitals in the bonding combination @xmath93 and in the electron operator @xmath94 .",
    "this is in turn the consequence of the oscillating sign of the hopping integral in ( [ ham ] ) so that the same mechanism should also be effective in the 2d cuo@xmath1-plane .",
    "+ the exact diagonalization results then can be summarized as follows : the oscillating sign of the @xmath46 hybridization induces an oscillating sign also in the bonding combination of @xmath41-orbitals around a given @xmath35-site .",

    "+ to summarize the discussion so far : the low - energy hole addition spectrum of the three - band model can be obtained to reasonable approximation from an effective single - band model whereby the @xmath41-like spectrum needs to be corrected by a simple @xmath0-dependent factor which originates from the interference between the phases of @xmath41-orbitals in the bonding combinations and the phases in a bloch state with momentum @xmath0 .",
    "if this correction is done @xmath41-like and @xmath35-like spectra can be obtained to good approximation from he spectrum of a single band hubbard model . + we now apply this finding to compute approximate the spectra for a cuo@xmath1 plane , but this time make use of the fact that in a single - band hubbard model larger clusters can be used as a reference system .",
    "we again apply the vca but thus time we use a @xmath154 cluster with periodic boundary conditions as reference system .",
    "we used a cluster with @xmath137 holes corresponding to a hole concentration of @xmath155 .",
    "it is important to use as large a cluster as possible for the exact diagonalization step , because only large clusters reproduce the incoherent continua in the spectral function sufficiently well and , as will be seen below , these incoherent continua are crucial to explain the experimentally observed spectra .",
    "solution of a @xmath154 cluster by exact diagonalization is only possible with periodic boundary conditions , which are not customary in vca calculations . on the other hand , we do not want to discuss the phase diagram of the hubbard model but we mainly want to obtain the spectral function so this is justified .",
    "in fact , the spectral function obtained by the simpler cluster perturbation theory@xcite is almost exactly the same as the one obtained by vca .",
    "+ having obtained an approximate spectrum for the single - band hubbard model we again use ( [ approx ] ) together with ( [ corrfac ] ) to obtain the @xmath35-like and @xmath41-like intensity for the three - band model .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig9 ] for momenta along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "+ it can be seen that the figure reproduces the waterfall effect quite well . in the @xmath35-like spectrum",
    "the low - energy quasiparticle band can be seen together with a broad high intensity part at more negative binding energy .",
    "moreover there is appreciable incoherent weight around @xmath156 .",
    "these incoherent continua are well known from exact diagonalization@xcite and self - consistent born calculations@xcite for the t - j model .",
    "their intensity decreases with increasing distance from @xmath156 .",
    "this decrease is due to the coupling of photoholes to spin and charge fluctuations@xcite . in the @xmath41-like spectrum",
    "the factor @xmath157 in ( [ corrfac ] ) creates the dark region around @xmath156 .",
    "accordingly , the quasiparticle band seems to disappear at @xmath158 .",
    "since the incoherent weight is reduced by the same factor @xmath157 , it disappears at the same momentum which creates the impression of a band which has a kink at @xmath158 . at the kink the spectral weight of the band drops sharply .",
    "qualitatively this is exactly what is seen in the arpes spectra which show the waterfall phenomenon .",
    "the chimney - like appearance of the spectum is due to the fact that the @xmath35-like spectral weight can be approximated by a product : @xmath159 decreases with @xmath160 - see the left part of figure [ fig9 ] - whereas the first factor , @xmath161 vanishes at @xmath156 and increases with @xmath160 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath41-like spectral weight must go through a maximum and this maximum corresponds to the apparent vertical part of the band . for a quantitative discussion it would be necessary to take into account also the interference between hole creation in cu3d@xmath19 and o2p orbitals .",
    "this however would necessitate to know the relative magnitude and phase of the respective dipole matrix elements and this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "( color online ) left : spectral function of the the single band hubbard model with @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "+ right : spectral function of the the single band hubbard model multiplied by @xmath164 ( see ( [ corrfac ] ) ) . ]",
    "lastly we wish to point out that the energy shift @xmath84 - i.e. the binding energy of the zrs - does indeed have some relevance for the interpretation of experimental data and has in a sense been observed directly .",
    "we refer to the results of meevasana _",
    "et al._@xcite ) who reported an anomalous enhancement of the noninteracting bandwidth in bi2201 .",
    "these authors pointed out that the energy difference between an assumed band bottom at @xmath3 and the fermi energy seems to be larger than the occupied bandwidth predicted by lda calculations and concluded that there is an anomalous correlation induced band widening rather than the expected correlation narrowing .",
    "+ we now estimate the position of @xmath165 with respect to an 1ev peak as an intrinsic reference energy and show that the fermi energy can be obtained quite accurately from a single - band hubbard or t - j model by consequent application of the zhang - rice construction@xcite . to begin with , meevasana _ et al . _",
    "observed a band at @xmath3 with downward curvature and a binding energy of @xmath166 relative to the fermi level at @xmath3 ( this is the band labelled b in figure 1 of ref .",
    "the authors point out that this is an umklapp of a band at the @xmath167-point , or @xmath31 in a simple cubic 2d model .",
    "this is therefore probably the same state as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. a state composed of o2p@xmath95 orbitals which right at @xmath31 has zero hybridization with any of the correlated cu3d orbitals",
    ". inspection of fig .",
    "3(c ) of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the energy of an _ electron _ in this state at @xmath31 - and accordingly its umklapp at @xmath3 - is @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the orbital energy for o2p electrons .",
    "since this is a single - particle - like state , the corresponding binding energy in the photoemission spectrum is @xmath170 .",
    "+ next , we consider the fermi energy .",
    "the largest part of the energy shift thereby is the binding energy of the zrs , @xmath84 , which was discussed above . in the matrices",
    "( [ singham_pl ] ) and ( [ twoham_pl ] ) the energy of a hole in an o2p orbital , i.e. @xmath171 , was chosen as the zero of energy so that we have to change @xmath172 .",
    "it remains to add the fermi energy @xmath173 of the single - band hubbard model itself : @xmath174 so that @xmath175 to evaluate @xmath84 we use the parameter set given by hybertsen _ et al._@xcite in their table i. the only exception is the direct oxygen - oxygen hopping .",
    "here we use the value @xmath176 which has been extracted directly from experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite where it also was found to be consistent with previous estimates .",
    "we then obtain @xmath177 .",
    "the fermi energy of the single - band hubbard model may be estimated from exact diagonalization results . in a @xmath154 cluster",
    "this was found to be @xmath178 at @xmath179@xcite and @xmath180 at @xmath181@xcite .",
    "estimated @xmath182 and @xmath183 so that @xmath184 .",
    "we estimate @xmath185 so that eventually @xmath186 .",
    "the value in figure 1 of meevasana _ et al . _ is @xmath187 .",
    "the agreement is reasonable given the uncertainty about some parameters but it is quite obvious that taking into account the binding energy @xmath84 is indispensable to obtain a correct estimate of the fermi energy .",
    "+ the value of @xmath188 obviously depends on @xmath189 so that small variations from one compound to the other may well explain the variations observed by meevasana _ at al._. the fermi energy of the hubbard model will change with doping as well , but these changes are a faction of @xmath190 .",
    "accordingly , the distance between the free - electron - like state at @xmath3 and the fermi energy should always be @xmath187 and this is indeed the case in bi2201 and bi2212@xcite .",
    "all in all one can say that the consequent application of the zrs picture can explain the position of the fermi energy relative to a 1ev peak - which forms a natural intrinsic reference energy - quite well .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the relationship between the single - particle spectra of actual charge - transfer models and corresponding effective single band hubbard models . in the noninteracting case",
    "@xmath48 the charge transfer models have several bands and it was found that those bands with predominant ligand ( i.e. @xmath41 character in the present models ) are almost unaffected by the strong correlations .",
    "bands with predominant @xmath35-character are split into two hubbard bands which can be mapped quite well to those of an effective single - band hubbard model .",
    "it turned out that the spectra of @xmath41 and @xmath35 electrons to good approximation can be obtained from that of the single band hubbard model by a constant shift in energy - the binding energy of the zhang - rice singlet - and , in the case of the @xmath41-like spectrum , by a factor which might be termed the form factor of the zhang - rice singlet .",
    "+ these results give a natural explanation for the waterfall phenomenon in terms of a pure matrix element effect - as has previously been inferred by inosov _",
    "et al._@xcite and zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite from an analysis of their experimental data . here",
    "one has to distingish between two different effects : the first one - pointed out already by ronning _",
    "et al._@xcite - applies only to the special situation of near - normal emission of photoelectrons . here",
    "the vanishing of the dipole matrix element @xmath191 makes it impossible to observe zrs - derived states .",
    "+ the second matrix element effect is the form factor of the zhang - rice singlet mentioned above , which describes the interference between the phases of the @xmath41-like photohole and those of the o2p - orbitals within a zhang - rice singlet - which locally correspond to a state with momentum @xmath31 .",
    "this makes it impossible to couple to a zrs - derived state by creating a @xmath41-like photohole with momenta near @xmath32 with integer @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "+ these two simple rules explain under which experimental conditions the waterfall is observed or not : in the hole - doped compounds and at photon energies where predominantly o2p - like holes are produced , the quasiparticle band around @xmath3 can be observed neither in the first nor in any higher brillouin zone and instead the waterfall appears . if photon energies where cu3d holes are generated are used , the quasiparticle band can not be observed in the first bz , but in higher brillouin zones . in this case",
    "the waterfall is absent and no kink in the quasiparticle band appears .",
    "+ in the electron - doped compounds the quasiparticles correspond to extra electrons in cu3d@xmath19 orbitals so that the considerations regarding the form factor of the zrs do not apply .",
    "the argument regarding the vanishing of the dipole matrix element @xmath191 , however , remain unchanged so that the quasiparticle band around @xmath3 can not be observed in the first brillouin zone either - this has indeed been observed by ikeda _ et al._@xcite and moritz _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it should be possible , however , to observe the full quasiparticle band without a kink in a higher brillouin zone .",
    "+ in those cases where the dark region around @xmath3 is present , the apparent vertical part of the waterfall corresponds to the incoherent continua in the single - particle spectral function of the t - j model .",
    "since these continua are formed from states which also correspond to zhang - rice singlets , they become extinct near @xmath32 as well .",
    "additional evidence comes from the fact that these band portions show the same dependence on photon polarization as the quasiparticle band itself@xcite .",
    "+ finally , the high intensity bands observed at @xmath3 at binding energies",
    "higher than @xmath187 have no correspondence in a single - band hubbard or t - j model - otherwise they would not be observed in normal emission - but are precisely the bands of predominant o2p - character which remain unaffected by the strong correlations .",
    "they are analogous to the @xmath192-peaks observed at high - symmetry points in cuprates@xcite and correspond to @xmath193 drived states which have little or no hybridization with the strongly correlated @xmath35-orbitals .",
    "these states therefore are essentially single particle states , which immediately explains their much higher intensity as compared to the quasiparticle band . +",
    "all in all the present theory indicates that the waterfall phenomenon constitutes an experimental proof of the zhang - rice construction of a single - band hubbard or t - j model to describe the low energy states of the cuo@xmath1 planes and in fact provides a direct visualization of the energy range in which the states of the real cuo@xmath1-plane correspond to those of a single - band hubbard or t - j model .",
    "it shows moreover that the incoherent continua predicted by various calculations for the t - j or hubbard model are indeed observable in experiment in that they are responsible for the vertical part of the waterfalls themselves .",
