    "the pyrochlore lattice , comprised of corner - sharing tetrahedra , is the archetype of magnetic frustration in three dimensions@xcite ( fig.[fig_crystallo ] ) . since its early study by anderson in 1956,@xcite frustrated spin hamiltonians on the pyrocholore lattice",
    "have provided a seemingly - inexhaustible source for the study of fundamental physics.@xcite in particular , spin liquid ground states have been predicted for such a lattice decorated with heisenberg@xcite or xxz@xcite spins .",
    "more recently , pyrochlore magnets have been put forward as realistic vehicles for the realization of a quantum spin ice ( qsi ) state , using the generic @xmath2 nearest - neighbour anisotropic exchange hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is a promising quantum spin ice candidate as it possesses both an ( effective ) @xmath2 spin , thanks to the well isolated crystal field kramers doublet ground state appropriate to yb@xmath3,@xcite and strong quantum fluctuations brought by anisotropic exchange interactions and an xy @xmath4-tensor.@xcite several studies have focused on the nature of the ground state in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , yet a consensus has been elusive to date.@xcite early neutron scattering experiments ruled out the presence of conventional static order down to 90mk in a polycrystalline sample@xcite , whereas other single crystal studies concluded the ground state was ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "the results of local probes are even more puzzling .",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath5sr ) measurements evidenced the presence of true static moments on the muon timescale , through the observation of both a drop of asymmetry and a decoupling of the muon spins in longitudinal applied fields@xcite , along with a drastic slowing down of the fluctuation rate below @xmath6 for certain samples@xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath5sr studies by dortenzio _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite found a non - magnetic , fluctuating ground state , in both stoichiometric polycrystalline and single crystal samples , _ despite _ the presence of pronounced specific heat anomalies at @xmath7  mk and @xmath8  mk , respectively .",
    "it is clear that local defects , either oxygen vacancies@xcite or excess magnetic ions@xcite ( referred to as stuffing ) , vary significantly between polycrystalline powders and single crystals , and are likely responsible for such sample dependencies . here , by applying hydrostatic pressure to well - characterized yb@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath11 samples , with @xmath12 and @xmath13@xcite",
    ", we observe a magnetic transition in the stoichiometric , @xmath12 sample from a disordered ground state into a splayed ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "this result sheds light on the origin of the sample dependence in the ground state selection for yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and is consistent with the recent theoretical proposal that yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 lies close to a phase boundary in the generic qsi hamiltonian phase diagram@xcite .",
    "@xmath5sr measurements under hydrostatic pressures as high as 25 kbar , and at temperatures as low as 0.245 k were performed on yb@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath11 samples , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the gpd beamline of psi .",
    "the muons are implanted inside the bulk of the material , and act as local magnetic probes .",
    "the signal coming from the muons that stop inside the pressure cell was measured separately and subtracted ( see supplementary fig . 1 and supplementary fig .",
    "2 ) from the overall signal .",
    "fig.[fig_musr]a shows the temperature dependence of the muon spin relaxation for the stoichiometric , @xmath12 sample in zero field , @xmath14 , as a function of time @xmath15 and under an applied pressure @xmath16  kbar .",
    "well above @xmath17 k , at @xmath18  k , the majority of the yb@xmath3 magnetic moments are paramagnetic and in a fast fluctuating regime , and display single - exponential relaxation . for @xmath19",
    "k , we observe the development of a small magnetic fraction @xmath20 of the yb@xmath3 moments , which grows non - linearly as the temperature decreases .",
    "the absence of oscillations at short time is indicative of a highly disordered magnetic state .",
    "the zero - field relaxation is well described by a gaussian distribution of static internal fields with standard deviation @xmath21 ( see supplementary note 1 ) , and the following phenomenological function : @xmath22 in a purely static scenario , the second term ( 1/3-tail ) should be constant . here ,",
    "a fluctuating component is nonetheless observed and we modelled this using a relaxation rate @xmath23 .",
    "the third term accounts for the paramagnetic component , and assumes the same relaxation rate @xmath23 , for simplicity .",
    "the unconventional shape of the zero - field longitudinal relaxation was discussed in detail in ref@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the evolution of the relaxation in temperature of the @xmath12 sample under zero applied pressure , in fig.[fig_musr]b , shows little or no magnetic fraction ( @xmath24% ) at any temperature above our base @xmath25  k , in agreement with dortenzio et al.s previously reported @xmath5sr studies . using equation ( [ pzf ] )",
    "we extract the magnetic fraction for each pressure and temperature , and collect the results in fig.[fig_musr]c .",
    "the development of the magnetic fraction with temperature is clearly pressure dependent , and turns on strongly at low temperatures , below @xmath17 k , for our minimum pressure of 1.2 kbar . for each pressure , one can define a critical temperature @xmath6 , such that for @xmath26 , 50% of the magnetic moments are frozen .",
    "the corresponding @xmath27 phase diagram is shown in fig.[fig_diag ] .",
    "clearly , the phase transition extrapolated from finite pressure measurements to zero pressure , agrees well with the sharp @xmath28 anomaly at @xmath17 k , appropriate to the @xmath12 sample .",
    "however the zero - pressure state for the @xmath12 sample at 0.245 k , below @xmath6 , is disordered , indicating that the ground state of the stoichiometric , @xmath12 sample , is a spin liquid .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath13 sample .",
    "the zero - field relaxation at @xmath25  k under zero and an applied pressure @xmath29  kbar are shown in fig.[fig_musr]d . strikingly , no frozen magnetic fraction is observed upon the application of a pressure as high as @xmath29  kbar .",
    "instead , we observe an increase of the relaxation for this @xmath13 sample , demonstrating its sensitivity to pressure .",
    "the temperature dependence of the relaxation is reported in fig.[fig_musr]e and f. one can speculate that a transition to a fully ordered state , as it is observed for the @xmath12 sample , would require higher pressures or lower temperatures , consistent with the lower @xmath30  k of the @xmath13 sample .",
    "@xmath5sr studies on other samples have reported a drastic slowing down of spin fluctuations@xcite , or static order@xcite , under _ zero _ applied pressure for temperatures below 0.25  k. in the light of our results , even relatively low ( applied or chemical ) pressure can destroy the disordered spin liquid state and induce magnetic order . a low level of defects in the different samples is a natural explanation to the contradictory @xmath5sr results .",
    "such disorder , at the @xmath31 2 % level , is difficult to characterize , but it is largely absent in polycrystalline samples , synthesized at lower temperatures by solid state methods .",
    "ti@xmath10o@xmath11*. the vertical axis displays the pressure @xmath32 in logarithmic scale and the horizontal axis the temperature @xmath33 .",
    "empty black circles define the transition line between the collective paramagnetic ( pm , orange ) and the splayed ferromagnetic ( sfm , blue ) regions relative to the @xmath12 sample .",
    "the transition temperature is defined such that for @xmath26 50% of the magnetic moments are frozen ( see fig.[fig_musr ] c ) .",
    "error bars allows @xmath6 to be defined between 40% and 60% of the magnetic fraction .",
    "the green region highlights the presence of a disordered , non - magnetic , phase ( qsl ) found at @xmath34 .",
    "black thick line is a guide to the eye .",
    "dashed purple line is the hypothetical transition line for @xmath13 . ]",
    "armed with the knowledge of the @xmath27 phase diagram in fig.[fig_diag ] , we sought to determine the nature of the pressure - induced magnetic order in yb@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath11 samples , with @xmath12 , by performing neutron diffraction on the stoichiometric powder sample at the d20 high - flux diffractometer of the ill .",
    "the detection of small magnetic moments under pressure using neutron diffraction is challenging due to the significant background signal of the pressure cell itself .",
    "fig.[fig_neutron]a shows the neutron diffraction data for the maximum hydrostatic pressure of the cell , @xmath35 kbar , and temperatures from 400 to 100mk , from which a background measured at 800mk was subtracted .",
    "we clearly observe the development of magnetic bragg intensities at the ( 111 ) , ( 311 ) , ( 222 ) and ( 004 ) positions upon cooling below 400mk .",
    "this is firm evidence for the existence of long range magnetic order in yb@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath11 samples , with @xmath12 , under an applied pressure @xmath35  kbar .",
    "the refinement of the neutron diffraction data gives us the temperature dependence of the ordered moment , shown in fig.[fig_neutron]b .",
    "the contrast with previous experiments under zero pressure is striking .",
    "first , the saturated moment @xmath36  @xmath37 is much smaller than that @xmath38  @xmath37 reported previously for different yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 samples@xcite , although similar to the ordered moment in the @xmath39 ordered state of yb@xmath0ge@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite second , the ordered moment vanishes cleanly above @xmath40  k , with no anomalous magnetic bragg intensity well above @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the previously reported order parameter at @xmath34 of our @xmath12 polycrystalline sample is anomalous @xcite ; it shows no change across @xmath6 and only falls off at much higher temperatures .",
    "consistency with our @xmath34 @xmath5sr results on the same sample requires that this bragg - like scattering is dynamic on slow time scales . that notwithstanding , the magnetic structure previously refined on the basis of a very high temperature ( @xmath31 8 k ) background subtraction gave a splayed ice - like ferromagnetic structure@xcite , with the moments on a tetrahedron lying mainly in the [ 100 ] direction with a positive splay angle @xmath41 , such that the moments tilt towards the local [ 111 ] direction ( fig.[fig_neutron]c ) .",
    "the components perpendicular to the local [ 111 ] axis obey the 2-in/2-out ice rule on a single tetrahedron .",
    "a different type of splayed ferromagnet , with the perpendicular components satisfying the all - in / all - out structure , has also been reported recently@xcite , in addition to a nearly collinear ferromagnet ( @xmath42)@xcite , for other samples .",
    "the magnetic structure associated with the true bragg scattering we refine here in the stoichiometric @xmath12 sample under @xmath35  kbar is also a splayed ice - like structure , but with a much reduced splay angle @xmath43 , such that it is close to a collinear [ 100 ] ferromagnet ( fig.[fig_neutron]d ) .",
    "these results bring a fresh perspective on the long standing debate about the presence or absence of static magnetic order in the quantum pyrochlore magnet yb@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath11 .",
    "the acute sensitivity to local ( through the yb@xmath3 stuffing ) or applied pressure is surprising .",
    "however , a corollary of our new @xmath27 phase diagram is that non - stoichiometric samples with non - zero chemical pressure can easily display an ambient applied pressure phase transition to a splayed ferromagnetic state at @xmath6 . yet ,",
    "this interpretation remains challenged by the fact that our @xmath13 sample does not show evidence for magnetic order at ambient pressure , and by previous reported observations of a magnetic transition in polycrystalline , likely @xmath44 , sample even under zero pressure@xcite .",
    "this may indicate that the non - magnetic low temperature region of the phase diagram is extremely narrow , existing only for a certain range of @xmath45 , whose absolute values are still to be determined .",
    "this would actually be reminiscent of the recent findings on the tb@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath11 pyrochlore magnet , that has been shown to display an ordered phase that is extremely sensitive to disorder , appearing only for @xmath46.@xcite    furthermore , the present work illustrates the relevance of applying hydrostatic pressure to tune the magnetic properties of frustrated pyrochlore compounds , a path that was followed by pioneering work on the other spin liquid candidate tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite in case of yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , we found that the pressure tunes the delicate balance between the anisotropic exchanges of the quantum spin ice hamiltonian , and selects a splayed ferromagnetic ground state away from the degenerate antiferromagnetic ground states manifold .",
    "this scenario confirms recent theoretical proposals that yb@xmath47ti@xmath47o@xmath48 lies close to phase boundaries derived from the generic @xmath49 quantum spin ice hamiltonian@xcite , and provides the missing key to understand its exotic magnetic properties . particularly appealing",
    "is the prediction that accidental degeneracies in the vicinity of these phase boundaries can lead to the emergence of a quantum spin liquid.@xcite this would offer a natural explanation for a non - magnetic , disordered state under zero pressure in stoichiometric yb@xmath47ti@xmath47o@xmath48 and recent observations of a continuum of gapless quantum excitations@xcite at low temperatures .",
    "after publication we became aware of the work of arpino et al .",
    "that study in details the effect of off - stoichiometry in yb@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath11 samples@xcite .",
    "the yb@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath11 samples with @xmath12 and @xmath13 were prepared at the brockhouse institute for materials research , mcmaster university .",
    "the @xmath12 powder sample was obtained through conventional solid - state reaction between pressed powders of yb@xmath0o@xmath50 and tio@xmath0 sintered at 1200@xmath51c in air .",
    "the @xmath13 powder sample was obtained by crushing a single crystal grown by the floating zone method in 4 atm of o@xmath0 with a growth rate of 5mm / h .",
    "more details on the details of the synthesis and the characterization can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath5sr measurements were carried out at the gpd instrument of the paul scherrer institut , switzerland .",
    "about 1 g of each powder sample was mixed with @xmath52 mm@xmath53 of a pressure medium ( daphne 7373 oil ) and placed inside the sample channel of a double - wall pressure cell .",
    "two different cells were used , labelled as ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ( see supplementary note 1 ) , and are described in more details in ref.@xcite .",
    "the muon momentum was adjusted in order to obtain an optimal fraction of the muons stopping in the sample , with optimal values found at @xmath54 and @xmath55 mev/_c_. the relaxation of both cells were measured without any sample down to 0.245 k. the applied pressure was determined by measuring the superconducting transition temperature of a small piece of pure indium inserted in the sample channel.@xcite      the neutron diffraction experiment was conducted at the d20 beamline , a high intensity two axis diffractometer , at the institut laue - langevin , using a neutron wavelength @xmath56  . a mass of 1.5 g of yb@xmath47ti@xmath47o@xmath48 powder sample and a small amount of nacl powder , which serves as a pressure calibration , were both mounted in a high pressure clamp cell and inserted in a @xmath53he-@xmath57he dilution fridge .",
