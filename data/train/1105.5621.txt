    "among the instruments for measuring the magnetic moment of a sample at high applied fields and cryogenic temperatures two types of magnetometers are most common : squid - based systems , which detect the flux through a closed superconducting loop , and the vibrating sample magnetometer@xcite ( vsm ) , which measures the change of flux through normal conducting pick - up coils .",
    "although the resolution of squid magnetometers exceeds that of a vsm by several orders of magnitude , the measurement speed of the vsm has made this instrument very popular for a fast characterisation of superconductors or magnetic materials , in particular , if the resolution is not critical .    in a vsm",
    "the harmonic translation of the sample induces a voltage in nearby pick - up coils , which is proportional to the magnetic moment of the sample .",
    "the obvious idea of rotating the sample , has , however , received less attention and only a limited number of instruments has been built.@xcite there is , to our knowledge , no rsm capable of measuring at cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields .",
    "this is probably due to the challenging mechanical construction : the bearing system must be compatible with cryogenic temperatures and the small bore size of high field magnets requires a very compact design , which limits the radius of the sample rotation .",
    "a simple consideration shows that despite this restriction the sensitivity of an rsm should exceed that of a vsm .",
    "the voltage induced in the pick - up coils is the product of the sample s speed @xmath0 and a geometric factor @xmath1 , which depends on the arrangement of the pick - up coils relative to the sample : @xmath2 . at a given frequency @xmath3 ,",
    "the speed of a sample rotating at a distance @xmath4 from the centre is @xmath5 and the maximum speed of a sample oscillating with amplitude @xmath6 is @xmath7 , i.e. , the rsm sample speed is greater if @xmath8 .",
    "this condition is easily met also in the narrow sample space of a cryostat equipped with a high - field magnet .",
    "moreover , there is a great potential to enhance the geometric factor @xmath1 by rotating the sample very close to the pick - up coils .",
    "schematic diagram of the rsm setup .",
    "a motor outside the vti connects to the drive shaft , which rotates the sample holder .",
    "the signal of the four pick - up coils is preamplified and measured by a lock - in amplifier using the reference signal provided by the motor controller.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    figure  [ fig : sketch ] sketches the main components of the rsm setup , which is similar to previously developed instruments and installed vertically into a gas - flow cryostat .",
    "the mode of operation is simple : a motor rotates the sample , which passes the pick - up coils positioned underneath .",
    "the induced voltage is preamplified and the harmonics are measured by a lock - in amplifier using the reference signal provided by the motor controller .",
    "we discuss the design of some crucial components in detail below .",
    "3d visualisation of the bottom part of the rsm .",
    "all components are inside a stainless steel tube coaxial with the magnetic field of the solenoid .",
    "the cylindrical bearings , which support the drive shaft are connected to the rsm tube ( only the lowermost is shown ) . the sample ( brown cube )",
    "is positioned in the ring - shaped grove of the aluminium sample holder and rotates closely above the coils . here ,",
    "the sample holder is shifted to show the bottom titanium tip ( black cone ) and the pick - up coil system ( equal colours refer to equal polarity ) . ]    a stainless steel tube of about one meter length and 28.5 mm in diameter ( 2.5 mm less than the inner diameter of our vti ) contains the pick - up coil system and all the mechanical components , except the brushless dc motor , which is outside the vti at ambient atmosphere and flanged to the top of the tube .",
    "the motor axle connects through a vacuum - tight seal to a short rod made of rubber . this elastic intermediate piece , which has a rigid connection with the drive shaft ,",
    "but is slideably mounted to the motor axle , fulfils two functions : it damps vibrations of the motor and compensates the differences in the thermal expansion of the stainless steel tube and the aluminium drive shaft ( a few millimetres when cooling the rsm to liquid helium temperature ) .",
    "the drive shaft ( 6.3 mm in diameter ) is coated with a carbon fibre reinforced polymer and supported by three plain bearings made of graphalloy@xcite ( the hollow cylinders have a length of 25 mm and an outer diameter of 19 mm ) . the aluminium sample holder ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bottom ] ) is screwed to the end of the drive shaft and can be removed for sample mounting .",
    "a ring - shaped groove machined close to the edge of the disk contains the sample ( usually glued with vacuum grease ) and reduces the sample to pick - up coil distance to about one millimetre .",
    "the bottom bearing is the most crucial component , because it has to guarantee stable rotation ( the main source of noise are vibrations ) and operate with low friction to avoid heating .",
    "this is achieved by the titanium tip of the sample holder , which spins in the conical hole of the metal disk underneath .",
    "the instrument rotates at 15hz , because the signal - to - noise ratio is optimal at this speed and the heat generation acceptably low .",
    "this corresponds to a signal with a frequency of 30hz , because the period of the pick - up coil system is half a rotation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] ) .",
    "the cooling power is provided by the helium gas flowing through holes at the bottom of the tube .",
    "( we tested the instrument also successfully in liquid helium . )",
    "because the temperature sensor can not be mounted to the rotating parts , it is positioned at a small distance just above the sample .",
    "signal of the pick - up coil system .",
    "( a )  four coils with alternating polarity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom ] ) compose the total signal .",
    "the graph also shows the contribution of two neighbouring coils positioned at 90 and 180@xmath9 to the total signal .",
    "this arrangement has two effects : first , an external field sweep generates no net signal , second , the individual signals interfere positively and create strong peaks .",
    "( b )  the period of the system is 180@xmath9 , i.e. , half a rotation .",
    "the first harmonic is the principle component and its peaks are shaped by the third harmonic ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : radius ] ) .",
    "all higher harmonics are almost negligible . ]",
    "the pick - up coil system is a fundamental part of the instrument , because the geometry factor @xmath1 defines the signal ( together with the speed @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to analyse the coil parameters in detail",
    ".    earlier work@xcite aimed at increasing the signal by maximising the flux through a single coil and suggested to use coils with a cross - section ( perpendicular to the axis ) , which is similar to that of the sample .",
    "we do not follow this design criterion , because a careful analysis requires that instead of the magnetic flux the measured quantity , i.e. , the strongest harmonic of the induction voltage , has to be optimised . in order to calculate the induced voltage ,",
    "the full time dependence of the flux must be known ; calculating the flux only at a certain position ( above the centre of the coil ) is not sufficient .",
    "our numerical calculations simulate the movement of a permanent magnet ( @xmath10mm@xmath11 ) over the pick - up coil system .",
    "the radius of the innermost winding @xmath12 and the sample - to - coil distance @xmath13 are fixed , whereas the outer radius @xmath14 and the height @xmath15 of the coils are free parameters in the simulations .",
    "we limited the calculations to a set of four coils , symmetrically positioned at a distance of 8 mm from the centre . a higher number of coils is impractical , because mounting and wiring four coils is already a very tedious task in the narrow sample space of the rsm . the polarity of the coils alternates as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom ] , which eliminates the induction produced by the external field sweep .",
    "after computing the flux as a function of the rotation angle by integrating the magnetic field through each winding and summing over all turns we calculate the induced voltage by derivation ( the time and the angular derivative are directly proportional ) and extract the harmonics by fourier transformation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] for an example ) .",
    "our simulation exactly represents the pick - up coil system without any simplifications , except that larger wire diameters of up to 100 m have been used to speed up the calculations .",
    "the calculations , which were carried out by varying @xmath14 for various @xmath15 , show that the total signal is mainly composed of the first and the third harmonic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] ) and that the reduction of the third harmonic results from the overlap of the coil signals .",
    "we find that the measured quantity , i.e. , the strong first harmonic of the induction voltage , increases up to the maximum outer coil radius compatible with our setup ( @xmath16 ) , even if the coil cross - section exceeds that of the sample .",
    "( figure  [ fig : radius ] presents this calculation with the coil height of the final setup . )",
    "this highlights the importance of exact numerical calculations of the true signal , because the application of a simpler design criterion based on the magnetic flux@xcite would result in coils with smaller radii and lower signal .",
    "moreover , the fact that the derivative of the first harmonic with respect to @xmath17 still increases at @xmath16 shows that the outermost windings contribute most to the signal .",
    "because space and not a loss in signal strength is the limiting factor in our configuration , we use the largest possible pick - up coils compatible with our setup : about 6 mm high with a radius of 4 mm having 8000 turns of 38 m thick copper wire .",
    "dependence of the pick - up coil signal on the outer coil radius .",
    "the magnitude of the first harmonic , which is the measurement quantity , does not decrease if the coil cross - section @xmath18 exceeds that of the sample ( approximately at @xmath19 ) .",
    "the derivative of the first harmonic with respect to @xmath17 still increases at @xmath16 , which demonstrates that the outermost windings contribute most to the signal . ]",
    "in a vsm the distance of the sample to the pick - up coils is usually much larger than its dimensions , which allows to treat the sample as a dipole .",
    "the small sample to pick - up coil distance of the rsm enhances the resolution , but makes the instrument also sensitive to the geometry of the sample .",
    "( note , that this is not a demagnetisation effect , which depends on the stray field of the sample and is independent of the measurement method . )",
    "it is therefore necessary to calibrate the rsm for every sample geometry and a reference measurement in another magnetometer is needed to determine the calibration constant .",
    "comparison of vsm and rsm measurements on a v@xmath20si single crystal after background subtraction .",
    "the rsm measurement shows very good agreement with the vsm data up to the maximum field of the vsm ( the rsm data is shifted for clarity in this graph only ) .",
    "the lower inset demonstrates the superior resolution of the rsm ( the grey area corresponds to the typical vsm noise of @xmath21am@xmath22 ) .",
    "the upper inset shows the determination of the upper critical field @xmath23 of the superconductor ( at this field the magnetic moment of the sample vanishes ) . here",
    ", the grey area indicates the rsm noise , which is as low as @xmath24am@xmath22 at 15 t .",
    "this allows a precise determination of this parameter up to high magnetic fields . ]",
    "measurements without a sample show that the background of the sample holder increases with the magnetic field and is as low as @xmath25 at 15 t .",
    "the low background is a consequence of the sample rotation : contrary to a vsm , where the oscillation moves the sample out of the centre of the magnet to lower fields the sample rotates around the symmetry axis of the magnet in the rsm and the magnetic field inhomogeneity does not have an effect ( also the sample holder does not break the symmetry ) .",
    "all the measurements presented herein use the first harmonic , because experiments have shown that it has the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( about a factor of ten less for the third harmonic ) .",
    "the noise decreases by orders of magnitude when disconnecting the motor and the drive shaft by removing the intermediate piece .",
    "this demonstrates that the main source of noise are mechanical vibration induced by the rotating drive shaft . under the assumption that the vibrations move the pick - up coil system in radial direction out of the centre of the magnet we can estimate the amplitude of these vibrations from the pick - up coil inhomogeneity and the radial magnetic field gradient .",
    "we find a vibration amplitude of about 5@xmath26 m .    to determine the resolution we carried out measurements on a superconducting v@xmath20si single crystal ( @xmath27mm@xmath11 ) in the rsm and in our oxford maglab vsm ( @xmath28 mm amplitude , 55hz ) using a field sweep rate of 0.5@xmath29 . here",
    ", the background , i.e. , the non - superconducting contribution , is due to the paramagnetic signal of the v@xmath20si sample and is highly linear .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp ] shows the reversible magnetisation after subtracting this term and demonstrates that both instruments agree well up to the maximum field of the vsm .",
    "the low noise level of the rsm , which is more than a factor of ten lower than that of the vsm , is compatible with the resolution of a magnetic moment as low as @xmath24am@xmath22 at a background field of 15 t .",
    "this allows to determine , for example , the upper critical field @xmath23 ( the field , where the magnetic moment of the superconductor goes to zero ) with great precision .",
    "the resolution of the rsm is excellent at high field sweep rates and can be further enhanced at the expense of measurement time by reducing the field sweep rate and increasing the averaging time of the lock - in amplifier .",
    "we successfully implemented a rotating sample magnetometer operating at cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields .",
    "after calibration the rsm measurements compare well to vsm data .",
    "the resolution of the rsm is @xmath24am@xmath22 at 15 t ( exceeding that of a typical vsm by about a factor of ten ) and the background signal of the sample holder is is as low as @xmath30am@xmath22 at 15 t .",
    "the magnetometer is thus ideally suited for a precise and swift characterisation of superconducting and magnetic samples in a wide temperature and magnetic field range .",
    "we wish to express our sincere gratitude to h. hartmann for technical support and acknowledge the assistance of j. emhofer with the cad software ."
