    "it has only been after the observations by the beppo - sax satellite and the optical identification of grbs that their enormous energetics , @xmath2@xmath3 times larger than those of sne , have been determined : energies of the order of @xmath4 erg , equivalent to the release of @xmath5 in few tens of seconds .",
    "this situation has become even more interesting after the observation of a temporal coincidence between the emission of a grb and a sn , see e.g. grb 980425@xcite and sn 1998bw@xcite .",

    "it was only in 1968 that a pulsar was discovered at its center following the predicted existence of rapidly rotating nss in that decade then soon after observed as pulsars .",
    "however , there still remains to explain an outstanding physical process needed to model this object : the expulsion of the shell of the sn during the process of gravitational collapse to a ns .",
    "we are currently gaining some understanding of the physical processes governing nss , motivated by the research on grbs and bh formation which is being fully exploited to this end at the present time .",
    "paradoxically the study of bhs was started by the discovery of the ns in the crab nebula .",
    "this study and the understanding of bh formation and consequently of the emission of grbs is likely to lead , in this faustian effort to learn the laws of nature , to the understanding of the process of ns formation and the expulsion of the remnant in the sn explosion .",
    "that nss exist in nature has been proven by the direct observation of pulsars .",
    "the year @xmath7 marked the discovery of the first pulsar , observed at radio wavelengths in november @xmath8 , @xmath7 by jocelyn bell burnell and antony hewish @xcite .",

    "i described how the observations of the vela satellites were fundamental in discovering grbs , see fig .",
    "initially it was difficult to model grbs to understand their nature since their distance from the earth was unknown , and thousands of models were presented @xcite attempting to explain the mystery they presented .",
    "just a few months after the public announcement of their discovery @xcite , with t. damour , a collaborator at princeton , i formulated a theoretical model based on the extractable energy of a kerr - newmann bh through a vacuum polarization process as the origin of grbs , see fig .",

    "the crucial contribution to interpreting grbs came from the beppo - sax satellite which led to a much more precise definition of their position in the sky obtained using a wide field x - ray camera and narrow field instrumentation .",
    "this enabled the optical identification of grbs and the determination of their cosmological redshifts , and consequently of their energetics , which turned out to be up to @xmath18 erg , precisely the value predicted by damour and myself in ref .  .",
    "since that time no fewer than ten different x- and @xmath22-ray observatory missions and numerous observations at optical and radio wavelengths have allowed us to reach a deeper understanding of the nature of grbs .",

    "instead our approach is directed to the fundamental physical processes occurring outside the horizon of a bh and to their possible detection in the dynamical phases of bh formation .",

    "this mechanism is essential to extract energy from the bh , an amount which can be as high as @xmath23 of its total mass energy as already mentioned above . to reach a theoretical understanding of this problem , it was necessary to introduce the dyadotorus , see fig .",

    "these results also agree with the well - understood ib / c nature of the sn associated with grbs .",
    "the most likely explanation for sn ib / c , which lack h and he in their spectra , is that the sn progenitor star is in a binary system with an ns ; see also refs .   and also .",

    "a total accreted mass of up to @xmath153 in a time of a few hours was obtained there for a normal type ii sn .",
    "thus a similar amount of mass can be accreted in the two cases , but in the latter the accretion occurs over a longer time .",
    "to reach a high accretion rate of the inner sn material onto the central ns , a mechanism is needed that helps to increase the density of the ns surrounding layers , which is decreasing due to the expansion after being unbound by the sn explosion .",
    "ref .   analyzed the possibility of having a reverse shock wave as this mechanism while it moves back through the sn core .",
    "the reverse shock is formed in the interaction of the mantle gas with the low - density envelope .",
    "the time scale of the accretion process is thus determined by the time it takes the reverse shock to reach the vicinity of the central newly born ns , which is a few hours in the case of sn ii progenitors .",
    "however , the existence of a low - density outer envelope , e.g. h and he outer layers , is essential for the strength of the reverse shock . fall - back accretion onto the central ns is expected to be relevant only in sn ii but not in sn ic like those associated to grbs , where h and he are absent .    the argument",
    "presented in naturally explains the sequence of events : sn explosion  igc - bh formation  grb emission .",
    "correspondingly , the accretion of the material ejected by the sn into the nearby ns of the igc model presented here occurs almost instantaneously .",
    "indeed for the sn expansion parameters obtained from the observations of episode 1 in grb 090618 ( see eq .",

    "<S> the coincidental occurrence of a grb with a supernova ( sn ) is explained within the induced gravitational collapse ( igc ) paradigm , following the sequence : 1 ) an initial binary system consists of a compact carbon - oxygen ( co ) core star and a neutron star ( ns ) ; 2 ) the co core explodes as a sn , and part of the sn ejecta accretes onto the ns which reaches its critical mass and collapses to a black hole ( bh ) giving rise to a grb ; 3 ) a new ns is generated by the sn as a remnant . </S>",
