    "temporal intermittency is the occurrence of a signal accompanied by random alternation between long laminar phases and relatively short bursts , which is widely observed in nonequilibrium dynamical systems .",
    "for example , the rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite , the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite , and an rf - driven josephson junction @xcite exhibit intermittent phenomena . in the field of nonlinear physics ,",
    "intermittency is tacitly understood as the occurrence of intermittent chaos .",
    "here we confine ourselves to the pomeau - manneville intermittency @xcite .",
    "the onset of intermittent chaos is associated with a loss of stability of periodic motion , which is classified into three types : type - i ( saddle - node bifurcation ) , type - ii ( hopf bifurcation ) , and type - iii ( subharmonic bifurcations ) .",
    "the pomeau - manneville ( pm ) system , @xmath0 @xmath1 , is a typical model of a poincar map for intermittent chaos @xcite .",
    "the system is called non - hyperbolic , since it has an indifferent fixed point @xmath2 with @xmath3 , in the neighborhood of which laminar motions are generated , and the ergodic measure @xmath4 localizes as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one of the important problems in such a non - hyperbolic system is the appearance of nonstationarity . in a nonstationary regime",
    "where @xmath6 , the ergodic measure @xmath4 can not be normalized , and the @xmath7 fluctuation is generated .",
    "nonstationarity can be shown , for example , in the behavior of the renewal function @xmath8 , which is the ensemble average of the number @xmath9 of chaotic bursts during the time interval @xmath10 $ ] @xcite .",
    "therefore , the renewal rate defined by @xmath11 represents the average occurrence probability of the bursts during @xmath10 $ ] . in stationary regimes , this probability does not depend on time , @xmath12 .",
    "however , in the nonstationary regime @xmath13 , it depends on time as @xmath14 . in particular , at the critical point @xmath15 , it behaves as @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the renewal rate indicates the nonstationarity of the intermittent chaos .",
    "although many studies of intermittency have dealt with chaotic systems , intermittent dynamics are also observed in nonchaotic systems .",
    "intermittent strange nonchaotic attractors ( snas ) are generically created in quasiperiodically forced systems through quasiperiodic saddle - node bifurcations @xcite , through quasiperiodic subharmonic bifurcations @xcite , and through several types of crisis @xcite , where the scaling behavior is characteristic of type - i , type - iii , and crisis - induced intermittency , respectively . unlike the analogy between the intermittencies in snas and those in chaotic systems , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the difference is not clear , except for the original difference in the sign of the largest nontrivial lyapunov exponent @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we present a marginal quasiperiodic gradient system ( mqpgs ) as a mathematical extension of a nonuniform oscillator @xmath17 , which arises in several fields , such as electronics , condensed - matter physics , mechanics , and biology @xcite , and study the stagnant motion generated by the system .",
    "the term `` nonchaotic stagnant motion '' in this paper represents anomalous dynamics accompanied by long laminar phases and those interruptions _ not _ based on chaotic dynamics .",
    "stagnant motion in a mqpgs is related to the spatial quasiperiodicity of the gradient , which differs from the temporal quasiperiodicity in intermittent snas .",
    "the quasiperiodic gradient could be implemented in some josephson junction circuits .",
    "our main result is the theoretical derivation of the asymptotic divergence of the displacement in a mqpgs . by comparing the asymptotic behavior in the mqpgs with the renewal rate in a pm system",
    ", we clarify a significant difference in the relaxation property of the long - time average of the dynamical variable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  ii introduces the mqpgs and mentions some implementation methods , section  iii presents the analysis of a two - period case of a mqpgs , and section  iv gives the derivation of the density function of residence times near stagnation points .",
    "section  v clarifies the parameter dependence of the largest residence time from a number - theoretic point of view , section  vi gives the derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the mqpgs , and the last section presents a comparison between the nonchaotic stagnant motion of mqpgs and the intermittent chaos of the pm system from the viewpoint of asymptotic behavior .",
    "a nonuniform oscillator @xcite is described by the equation @xmath18 in the time scale normalizing the phase - averaged angular frequency . here",
    "@xmath19 is the control parameter , and @xmath20 corresponds to the uniform oscillator .",
    "the nonuniform oscillator has a phase - drift ( @xmath21 ) or phase - locked state ( @xmath22 ) as a result of saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "there are many oscillatory phenomena explained by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nonuniform ] ) , such as those in oscillating neurons , firefly flashing , a josephson junction and an overdamped pendulum driven by a constant torque @xcite .    as a mathematical extension ,",
    "it is natural to ask what happens when the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nonuniform ] ) becomes quasiperiodic .",
    "thus , we introduce an mqpgs described by a one - dimensional ordinary differential equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are parameters , @xmath26 is irrational , and @xmath27 .",
    "we are also interested in the rational system ( @xmath26 is rational ) , since the mqpgs is indistinguishable from well - approximated rational systems in a finite time and with finite resolution .",
    "the mqpgs could be implemented in asymmetric multijunction superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) modeled after 3jj squid ratchet proposed by zapata et al .",
    "figure  1 shows the schematic representation of an asymmetric multijunction squid threaded by a flux @xmath28 , where the left and right branches contain @xmath29 and @xmath30 identical josephson junctions , respectively .",
    "the squid is driven by a dc current @xmath31 , which splits into two branch currents , @xmath32 ( left ) and @xmath33 ( right ) .",
    "we assume that the junctions are described by the resistively shunted junction ( rsj ) model @xcite with resistance @xmath34 and critical current @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , we consider the overdamped limit , @xmath36 , where the junction capacitance @xmath37 is negligible ( see fig .  1(b ) ) , and also the nyquist noise current is neglected",
    ". then , the phase @xmath38 , across the single junction @xmath39 on the left branch , obeys the following equation : @xmath40 on the right arm , the phase @xmath41 of the junction @xmath42 obeys the equation obtained by replacing labels @xmath43 and @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : squid ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "if identical initial conditions are assumed , the only solutions for each junction are phase - locked states , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the limit where the total loop inductance @xmath47 is negligible , @xmath48 ,",
    "the total flux is approximately equal to the external flux @xmath28 , where @xmath49 is the flux quantum .",
    "then , the integration of the gauge invariant phase around the loop yields @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , the kirchhoff s current law @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 which approximately describes the mqpgs with @xmath54 , under the condition of @xmath55 , if all the variables are transformed properly . note that the better approximation of @xmath54 yields the better implementation .",
    "also , the mqpgs could be implemented in a dc - driven circuit consisting of overdamped josephson junctions coupled by ideal transformers .",
    "however , we omit a detailed description , since this is not the purpose of this paper .",

    "we observe the alternation between long stagnant phases and rapid moving phases , which is reminiscent of intermittent chaos ( see inset of fig .  2 ) .",
    "when @xmath57 is irrational , the equilibrium points vanish except for the origin , but the motion stagnates in the vicinity of @xmath75 if the value of @xmath57 is close to @xmath65 .",
