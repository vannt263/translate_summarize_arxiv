    "the abundance of li is a predictable function of surface temperature .",
    "spectroscopy of large samples of stars in the milky way s halo @xcite and in metal - poor globular clusters @xcite show that li abundances in dwarf stars remain at the same value ( @xmath4)$ ] where @xmath5 is the number density of atoms . ] until the first dredge - up on the subgiant branch . in this surface convection episode ,",
    "material from deeper , hotter layers of the stars mixes with material at the stellar surface .",
    "the deeper layers contain no li because li burning is very efficient at @xmath6  k , cool compared to hydrogen burning temperatures . as a result ,",
    "the first dredge - up depletes the photospheric value of li by a factor of 1520 @xcite .",
    "another dilution episode occurs at the luminosity function bump in the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "extra mixing processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) further introduce li - depleted material to the stellar surface .",
    "the abundance of li in red giants drops drastically as the star evolves beyond the rgb bump .",
    "after both dilution episodes , the number density of li atoms drops to below 10 parts per trillion .",
    "almost all first - ascent red giants with luminosities greater than the rgb bump have @xmath7 .",
    "some stars exhibit glaring exceptions to the standard picture of li evolution .",
    "for example , excess li often accompanies @xmath8c enhancement in cj stars @xcite .",
    "these stars could have participated in `` hot bottom burning '' ( a phrase coined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wherein @xmath9li can be synthesized in the star and observed at its surface @xcite .",
    "specifically , the reaction @xmath10 , part of the pp - ii hydrogen burning chain , occurs at temperatures greater than @xmath11  k. li can be produced from be by electron capture : @xmath12 .",
    "however , the second reaction must occur at @xmath13  k , or else the li will be destroyed by proton capture .",
    "the proposed cameron - fowler ( @xcite ) mechanism solves the temperature discrepancy by theorizing that @xmath9be can be brought to the surface of the star , where it may capture an electron to create @xmath9li .",
    "the stellar surface is cool enough to preserve li .",
    "however , the ongoing convection guarantees that the surface li atoms do not last long .",
    "they quickly return to destructive temperatures .",
    "thus , the surface composition of li is a balance between its creation by the cameron - fowler mechanism and its destruction by convection .",
    "hot bottom burning is effective at producing @xmath9li in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with masses of about 47  @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the convective envelopes of these stars reach layers where @xmath9be is created .",
    "however , some less massive giants on both the rgb and agb have been found to be li - rich ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the convective envelopes of these stars do not reach layers with @xmath9be .",
    "therefore , @xmath9be should not be transported to the surfaces of these stars in the context of the standard model of stellar evolution .",
    "if the cameron - fowler mechanism is operating in these stars , then it requires `` extra mixing '' or `` cool bottom processing '' @xcite to connect the base of the convective envelope to deeper regions of the star that contain be . at one time , thermohaline convection was considered as a source of the extra mixing @xcite , but the diffusion was later shown to be too slow to account for the photospheric compositions of red giants @xcite .",
    "alternative mixing processes include magnetic buoyancy @xcite and rotation @xcite",
    ".    even though low - mass , li - rich giants are rare , their existence challenges the standard theory of stellar evolution .",
    "they have spawned numerous modifications to the standard model .",
    "different explanations depend on the evolutionary state of the star : the rgb bump @xcite , the agb @xcite , or even anywhere along the rgb @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the composition of the star also influences the strength of extra mixing and therefore the surface abundance of li @xcite .",
    "globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) are excellent places to search for li - rich giants . first , they offer space densities high enough for efficient observations with multi - object spectrographs .",
    "second , the stars are at a uniform distance , which eases the determination of evolutionary state and li abundance .",
    "]    @xcite obtained spectra of nearly 3000 red giants in eight dsphs with the deimos medium - resolution , multi - object spectrograph @xcite on the keck  ii telescope . of these data ,",
    "2812 spectra included the spectral region around the resonance line at 6708   .",
    "the slit placement of the other stars caused their spectra to terminate redward of 6708   .",
    "we quantified the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns ) of the spectra in the vicinity of the li line by computing the inverse standard deviation of continuum - normalized pixels within 8    of the li line but excluding the 4    immediately surrounding the line .",
    "we searched for detections of the li line in the 2054 spectra with @xmath15 that included the appropriate spectral range .",
    "we found 15 spectra with strong li lines .",
    "the sample is random because the stars were not chosen for any property that could predict li enhancement .",
    "one of these stars , star 461 in the draco dsph , was already known to be li - rich @xcite .",
    "the other stars belong to five dwarf galaxies : sculptor , fornax , leo  i , leo  ii , and canes venatici  i. this sample more than doubles the number of known li - rich , metal - poor ( @xmath2 } \\la -0.7 $ ] ) red giants .",
    "table  [ tab : sample ] gives the identities of the 14 newly discovered , li - rich stars . because the stars reside in different galaxies , the photometry is not homogeneous .",
    "table  [ tab : sample ] gives the filter set in which each star was observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the li - rich stars spectra around the li line , and table  [ tab : abundances ] gives the previously measured @xcite temperatures , surface gravities , microturbulent velocities , and metallicities for these stars .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the li resonance lines by fitting gaussians . in order to estimate the uncertainty on ew",
    ", we resampled the spectra 1000 times . in each realization",
    ", we perturbed the flux value of each pixel .",
    "the amount of perturbation was sampled from a gaussian random distribution with a width equal to the measurement uncertainty of the pixel s flux .",
    "the ews of the detected li lines range from 175 to 694  m",
    ". table  [ tab : abundances ] gives the ews .",
    "we measured the ews only to illustrate that these lines are very strong and easily detected .",
    "we used spectral synthesis , not the ews , to quantify the li abundances .",
    "the li - rich stars positions in color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds , figure  [ fig : cmds ] ) are consistent with either the rgb or agb .",
    "the colors and magnitudes of the two branches are hardly different for the old populations typical of dsphs . whether the stars in our sample belong to the rgb or agb , they belong to dwarf galaxies that are too old to host the 47  @xmath16 agb stars that can produce li in the standard model of stellar evolution @xcite",
    ". the colors of the li - rich stars are also much redder than intermediate - mass agb stars .",
    "therefore , these low - mass stars are anomalous regardless of their evolutionary states .",

    "the existence of li - rich red giants and their abundances do not correlate with any measurable parameter .",
    "although @xcite found that li - rich giants seem to cluster in the cmd , including at the rgb bump , our sample shows no such clustering . @xcite and @xcite found a similar result in the milky way disk and bulge .",
    "these and our samples have the advantage that the stars are in stellar systems with known distances .",
    "therefore , the magnitude distance from the rgb bump does not need to be inferred from spectroscopically determined atmospheric parameters .",
    "in addition to positions in the cmd , our stars temperatures , surface gravities , iron abundances , and [ @xmath144/fe ] abundance ratios are not unusual in any regard with respect to li - normal stars in the same dwarf galaxies .",
    "although the resolution of our spectra is too low to measure rotation , at least 80% of metal - poor , li - rich red giants in another survey @xcite exhibit typical rotation velocities .    the typicality of metal - poor , li - rich stars in all regards",
    "except li abundance suggests that these stars are not unusual in terms of their intrinsic properties or external stimuli .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of li - rich , metal - poor giants in our sample shows that the frequency of the li - rich phenomenon in dsphs  about 1%is roughly the same as in the milky way disk , bulge , and halo @xcite .",
    "the apparent randomness of giants that exhibit large li abundances restricts extra mixing models .",
    "for example , the sudden increase in angular momentum caused by engulfment of a planet could induce extra mixing @xcite .",
    "however , the occurrence of planets in the solar neighborhood is far more likely around metal - rich stars @xcite .",
    "assuming that stars in dsphs also obey a correlation between metallicity and the occurrence of hot jupiters and that the occurrence relation extends to very low metallicities ( @xmath145 } < -0.5 $ ] ) , the stars in our sample are extremely unlikely to host hot jupiters .",
    "in fact , we could find no model in the literature that adequately explains the available observations for li - rich , low - mass , metal - poor giants ( li enhancements as high as @xmath146 even near the tip of the rgb , no concentration in the cmd , weak correlation with rotation ) .",
    "because li - rich , metal - poor giants are otherwise ordinary , we suggest that li enhancement does not arise only in special cases . instead , we echo a previous suggestion @xcite that extra mixing and its associated li enhancement could be a brief , universal phase of stellar evolution .",
    "the lifetime of a 10  gyr old red giant is 420  myr , 35  myr of which is spent above the rgb bump @xcite .",
    "the rate of li depletion with increasing luminosity in ngc  6397 @xcite is roughly @xmath147 . just above the rgb bump ,",
    "red giants brighten by one magnitude in 19  myr @xcite . from these derivatives",
    ", we infer that the @xmath148-folding time for li in the atmosphere of a normal , metal - poor red giant near the rgb bump is about 5  myr , or 15% of the lifetime of the red giant above the rgb bump . however ,",
    "the convection zone is deeper closer to the rgb tip than at the rgb bump , so the li destruction rate must accelerate .",
    "furthermore , the destruction rate could be even faster in the presence of extra mixing , which brings photospheric material to even hotter temperatures .",
    "the accelerated li destruction could conspire to reduce the observable lifetime of an instantaneously li - enhanced star to just 1% of the lifetime above the rgb bump . in this scenario ,",
    "about 1% of all red giants above the bump would appear li - rich .",
    "@xcite postulated that this process happens at the rgb bump in a li flash that also serves to temporarily increase the luminosity of the red giant , which could explain why li - rich giants are observed at all luminosities between the bump and the tip of the rgb . however , neither @xcite nor @xcite could achieve high enough mixing rates in their models to trigger a li flash .",
    "nonetheless , the idea that li enhancement is a brief , universal phase of stellar evolution remains attractive in order to explain the lack of correlation with almost any other measurable parameter .",
