    "the schramm - loewner evolution sle@xmath2 is a one - parameter family of conformally invariant measures on non - intersecting planar curves . in many cases , interfaces in two - dimensional models of statistical mechanics at criticality",
    "are conjectured to be described by sle .",
    "for example , the scaling limit of the planar loop - erased random walk ( lerw ) is known to be sle@xmath3 , interfaces in the 2d ising model sle@xmath5 and critical percolation hulls to be described by sle@xmath6 . while these systems can be also studied using traditional methods of theoretical physics like ( boundary ) conformal field theory and coulomb gas methods",
    ", schramm has given a novel and rigourous approach via conformally invariant stochastic growth processes .",
    "lerws were the starting point and motivation for the development of sle in schramm s seminal paper @xcite .",
    "today their scaling limits and relations to sle are well understood in simply - connected domains , where conformal invariance was shown by lawler , schramm and werner @xcite .",
    "properties in multiply - connected domains are more involved but much recent progress was obtained , e.g. in a series of works by dapeng zhan @xcite . in this paper , we mainly study properties of planar lerws / sle@xmath3 in doubly - connected domains , emerging from one boundary component and conditioned to finish when hitting the second boundary component .",
    "in contrast to the simply - connected case , curves in doubly - connected domains may wind non - trivially around various boundary components . here",
    "we concentrate on these winding properties of loop - erased random walks on cylinders in two cases : ( 1 ) with one endpoint fixed on one boundary component , and the other endpoint free on the other boundary component , ( 2 ) with both endpoints fixed on different boundary components .",
    "we establish these results by solving a differential equation arising from sle@xmath2 with @xmath1 on the cylinder . another motivation to study",
    "the cylinder is that numerical simulations of critical systems are often performed in a cylinder geometry , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "@xmath7 we give a brief description of sle .",
    "in particular , we outline two variants of sle in simply - connected domains which prove to be limits ( in some sense ) of the doubly - connected case . after this",
    "we discuss sle on cylinders , being prototypes of doubly - connected domains .",
    "section @xmath8 provides a detailed discussion on endpoint probabilities and winding properties of sle@xmath2 on cylinders .",
    "inspired from analogies with diffusion - advection in @xmath9-dimensional burgers flows , we present analytical results for the case @xmath1 , study various limits and point out a relation between the winding of lerws and conditioned one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "finally , conditioning walks to exit via a given point , we derive the winding statistics for lerw with fixed endpoints on the cylinder . in section",
    "@xmath10 , somewhat aside the main topic , we provide the endpoint distribution in the case @xmath11 and point out a relation to reflected two - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "we conclude in section @xmath12 .",
    "the appendix contains computations of exit probabilities for brownian motion and random walks on the lattice , in relation to distribution of exit points for sle@xmath3 and their finite - size corrections .",
    "it also contains a partial ( periodised ) result about bulk left - passage probabilities with respect to a point in the covering space of the cylinder , as well as a path - integral version of the endpoint distribution problem .",
    "in this section we give an informal description of sle . for detailed accounts we refer the reader to the many existing excellent review articles on this subject ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "stochastic loewner evolutions ( sle ) describe the growth of non - intersecting random planar curves or hulls emerging from the boundary of planar domains @xmath13 by means of stochastic differential equations .",
    "a crucial feature of sle is _ conformal invariance _ : if two domains @xmath13 and @xmath14 are related by a conformal mapping @xmath15 , then the image of sle in @xmath13 is sle in @xmath16 .",
    "another key property is the so - called _ domain markov property _ of sle .",
    "conditioning on the curve / hull @xmath17 grown up to time @xmath18 in @xmath13 , the remainder of the curve is just sle in the slit domain @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , these two properties are ( almost ) imply that the growing hulls a characterised by a single positive parameter @xmath20 .    for simply - connected domains , conformal invariance and the riemann mapping theorem naturally lead to a description of the curves in terms of conformal mappings @xmath21 which uniformise @xmath22 to @xmath13 , and map the tip of @xmath17 to some point on the boundary of @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath21 is solution of a differential equation in @xmath18 with initial condition @xmath23 , called the _ loewner equation_. sle in simply - connected domains comes in different flavours , according to which the loewner differential equation varies . in section",
    "[ sec : slescd ] , we shall concentrate on so - called radial and dipolar sles .",
    "compared to simply - connected domains , sle in multiply - connected domains , proves to be more involved because no equivalent of the riemann mapping theorem is at hand @xcite . in this article",
    ", we concentrate on doubly - connected domains @xmath13 with the topology of an annulus .",
    "their boundary is given by two disjoint simple curves @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "a classical theorem of complex analysis states that each such a domain may be mapped onto the annulus @xmath26 with some @xmath27 , such that for example @xmath24 is mapped to @xmath28 and @xmath25 to @xmath29 .",
    "conformal invariance of sle legitimates the choice of @xmath30 as a reference domain .",

    "the cylinder @xmath34 may always be mapped back onto @xmath30 via the conformal mapping @xmath35 .",
    "the height of the cylinder @xmath27 is called _ the modulus _ , and the boundary components are given by @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37+ip$ ] which we shall refer to as `` lower '' and `` upper boundary '' respectively .",
    "we shall study hulls @xmath17 growing from @xmath38 to @xmath39 as shown on figure [ fig : strip]a and b. in section [ sec : sledcd ] , we analyse the loewner equation for @xmath21 mapping @xmath40 to some cylinder @xmath41 with ( in general ) different modulus @xmath42 .",
    "a mapping back to @xmath34 does not exist since one may show that there is no conformal mapping sending a cylinder of modulus @xmath43 to a cylinder of modulus @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we show how the doubly - connected version of sle on @xmath34 interpolates between radial and dipolar sle .      before embarking into considerations on general values for the modulus @xmath43 we shall consider limiting cases of semi - infinite cylinders @xmath44 and very thin cylinders @xmath45 in order to establish a connection with well - known variants of sle in simply - connected domains .",
    "_ @xmath44 and radial sle . _",
    "radial sle starts from a boundary point @xmath46 to a bulk point @xmath47 of some simply - connected planar domain @xmath13 .",
    "its loewner equation is most conveniently written for the unit disc @xmath48 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 where @xmath51 where @xmath52 is some real - valued function of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( the point @xmath55 remains unchanged during time evolution ) .",
    "the time parametrisation has been chosen so that @xmath56 .",
    "the real - valued function @xmath52 is related to the image of the tip @xmath57 of the growing trace @xmath17 by @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , conformal invariance and the domain markov property imply that @xmath59 is simple brownian motion with a diffusion constant @xmath20 and a linear drift @xmath60 . if we ask for rotation invariance as it occurs in physical systems ( and throughout this paper ) , the drift vanishes @xmath61 . for later considerations",
    ", we outline another useful version of radial sle .",
    "in fact , the unit disc @xmath62 may be sent to the semi - infinite cylinder @xmath63 via the conformal mapping @xmath64 ( here the principal branch of the logarithm has been chosen ) . in this geometry , the loewner equation for the new uniformising map @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 obtained from ( [ radialeq ] ) using @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "since we aim at studying winding probabilities , let us recall how to estimate the distribution of the winding angle @xmath68 for large @xmath18 @xcite . for the unit disc @xmath62 as @xmath69 ,",
    "the tip of the radial sle trace @xmath57 approaches @xmath70 . we may therefore write @xmath71 , by using the taylor series expansion @xmath72 near @xmath70 , from what follows @xmath73 .",
    "hence the winding angle @xmath74 turns out to be a gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath75 . for the infinite cylinder @xmath63",
    ", the winding angle corresponds to the real part of the tip allowed to vary continuously on @xmath76 , and its probability distribution is approximately given by @xmath77    _ @xmath45 and dipolar sle . _",
    "another version of sle is obtained by considering planar curves in a simply - connected domain @xmath13 from a boundary point @xmath46 to a side arc @xmath78 @xcite not containing @xmath79 .",
    "let us choose the geometry of an infinite strip @xmath80 of height @xmath43 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "this version of sle is related to the cylinder problem on @xmath34 in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "loosely spoken , if @xmath43 is very small the sle trace will not feel the periodicity of the cylinder but only hit the upper boundary close to the point @xmath88 on the upper boundary ( this statement can be made more precise , see below ) .",
    "the equivalent to the winding angle distribution for radial sle is the probability distribution of this exit point for dipolar sle , which we shall denote @xmath89 . for any @xmath20 it is given by @xcite @xmath90^{4/\\kappa } }    \\label{eqn : dipolarepd}\\ ] ]      let us now turn to the case of general modulus @xmath43 .",
    "the loewner equation for the uniformising map @xmath21 of sle@xmath0 on @xmath34 is given by @xcite @xmath91 with standard brownian motion @xmath92 and the function @xmath93 the process is defined between @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) where the trace starts from point @xmath70 on the lower boundary up to @xmath96 where the sle trace hits the upper boundary at some random point @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "the time parametrisation of the curves is chosen in such a way that @xmath21 maps @xmath40 to @xmath41 with @xmath99 .",
    "one possible way to derive and is by considering an infinitesimal hull , and using invariance properties of @xmath34 , namely translation invariance @xmath100 and reflection invariance @xmath101 ( see @xcite where this has been explicitly carried out for an annulus geometry ) .    [",

    "we decompose the honeycomb lattice into two triangular sub - lattices whose sites are coloured by @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "nearest neighbours of a @xmath105site thus belong to the @xmath106lattice and vice versa .",
    "we study lattice walks starting from a @xmath105site at the lower boundary to some any @xmath106site at the upper boundary and shall impose absorbing boundary conditions on @xmath106sites at either boundary .",
    "in fact , it shall be convenient to map the problem to a `` brick wall '' lattice as shown on figure [ fig : geometry]b , and introduce a suitable coordinate system .",
    "then it is straightforward to write the the master equations for the probability @xmath107 that the walker starting from @xmath108 can be found at @xmath109 at time @xmath18 : @xmath110 with boundary conditions @xmath111 and @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the kronecker symbol which takes the value @xmath114 if @xmath115 , and @xmath116 otherwise . moreover , identification of @xmath117 and @xmath118 leads to periodicity @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",

    "the reader may find a detailed account of the strategy with applications to other lattice types in @xcite .",
    "here we only sketch the solution .",
    "first , we solve the bulk equation by a separation ansatz @xmath134 .",
    "forming linear combinations of solutions found from this ansatz , we obtain the general bulk solution @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are constants , @xmath139 and @xmath140 index sets , and @xmath141 however , we exclude @xmath142 .",

    "in the case where @xmath143 is odd , @xmath117 takes even values from @xmath149 to @xmath150 . introducing a lattice scale @xmath151 such that @xmath152 , @xmath153 , we would like to study the scaling limit @xmath154 , @xmath155 in such a way that the geometrical height @xmath156 and width @xmath157 remain finite .",
