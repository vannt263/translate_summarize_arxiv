    "two types of elastic models that focus on the faithful reproduction of macroscopic quantities like the hs fraction , are the following : in the first approach , the cooperativity in the hs - ls transition is defined in terms of local distortions which interact with one another elastically causing a long range effective interaction between spin states .",
