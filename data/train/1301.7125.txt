    "this observatory was established in 1995 to push forward with the super - kamiokande experiment and has become a world frontier center of neutrino physics .",
    "many studies complementary to the flagship sk are also ongoing as illustrated in figure  [ map ] .",
    "experiments to search for dark matter and double beta decay are very active now .",
    "further a new 3  km gravitational wave telescope is being constructed and the next generation flagship experiment : hyper - kamiokande is seriously discussed in japanese physics community .",
    "super - kamiokande ( sk ) is a water cherenkov detector containing 50,000 tons of pure water viewed by 11,129 ( inner detector:32kton ) and 1,885 ( outer detector:18kton ) photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "a broad range of energies is studied with the sk detector , from a few mev up to @xmath6(tev ) . in the low energy region below @xmath720mev ,",
    "solar neutrino interactions are detected by neutrino - electron scattering . at higher energies , atmospheric neutrino interactions covering 5 orders of magnitude",
    "are detectable by neutral- and charged - current neutrino - nucleon interactions .    in this presentation , we focus on the lower energy physics , solar neutrino .",
    "sk detects solar neutrinos through neutrino - electron elastic scattering , where the energy , direction , and time of the recoil electron are measured . due to its large ( 22.5kton )",
    "fiducial mass sk makes precise measurements of @xmath8b solar neutrinos , including precision information on their energy spectrum and its time variation .",
    "since sk - iii started , we have made many efforts to reduce backgrounds .",
    "the most serious background comes from the beta decay of @xmath9bi , which is produced in the decays of radon in the air and detector materials as well as from radium in the water . in order to reduce the @xmath9bi background ,",
    "the sk water system has been upgraded .",
    "first , the cooling power of the heat exchanger for the supply water was increased so as not to induce convection in the tank , which transports radon near the pmts into the fiducial volume .",
    "second , new membrane degasifier units were added to increase the efficiency of radon removal from the supply water .",
    "third , the water flow in the detector was precisely investigated and optimized to reduce the background contamination in the fiducial volume as much as possible . during the sk - iv period",
    "we have introduced a precise temperature control system for the inlet water to further reduce convection in the water .    as a result of these improvements ,",
    "the background rate in the lower energy region in sk - iv has been reduced by a factor of more than three compared to the sk - i period .",
    "further , it has allowed a lower analysis energy threshold . until the end of march 2012 ,",
    "1069.3 days of sk - iv solar neutrino data for analysis was taken .",
    "a clear solar neutrino signal in the 3.5 - 4.0mev kinetic energy region was observed at more than @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , we developed a new analysis method for these low energy regions based on the amount of multiple coulomb scattering of electrons using the pmt hit pattern of the cherenkov cone .",
    "lower energy electron hit patterns ( i.e. the @xmath9bi background ) are more isotropic than those of the higher energy solar neutrino recoil electrons .",
    "this analysis improves the statistical uncertainty of the number of signal events by about 10% .",
    "we use this new method for recoil energies below 7.5mev .",

    "the @xmath24 value using the combined sk - i to sk - iv data is @xmath25 , which is a 2.3@xmath14 difference from zero .",
    "figure.[sk : sol05 ] shows @xmath24 as a function of @xmath26 together with the expectation .",

    "this analysis was then compared and combined with the reactor neutrino results from kamland@xcite .",
    "the obtained range of sin@xmath29 from the solar global analysis is @xmath30 , while the value of the kamland reactor analysis is @xmath31 . in the combined fit sin@xmath29",
    "was found to be @xmath32 , which is a roughly 2  @xmath14 hint that @xmath33 is different from zero .",
    "this has been already discussed prior to 2010@xcite .",
    "after 2011 , the t2k and reactor experiments presented indications and later evidence for a finite @xmath33 . the combination of their measurements yields @xmath34 and the result of the combined analysis of the global solar and kamland reactor data is consistent with this value .",
    "assuming @xmath35 is fixed at 0.025 , the obtained parameters from the global solar analysis are @xmath36ev@xmath37 and sin@xmath38 . comparing these values with those from kamland , ( @xmath39ev@xmath37 and sin@xmath40 ) , there is a 1.8  @xmath14 level tension in the @xmath41 results . combining the global solar data with kamland ,",
    "the oscillation parameters become @xmath42ev@xmath37 and sin@xmath43 .",
    "among the most plausible dark matter candidates , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which are expected to couple to ordinary matter primarily through the weak force , can be detected directly through observation of nuclear recoils produced in their elastic scattering interactions with detector nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the most convincing signature of the wimps appears in the directions of nuclear recoils .",
    "it is provided by the earth s velocity through the galactic halo ( @xmath7230  km / s ) and the distribution of the nuclear recoil direction shows a large asymmetry .",
    "hence , detectors sensitive to the direction of the recoil nucleus would have a great potential to identify wimps .",
    "time projection chambers ( tpcs ) with fine spacial resolutions are among such devices , and we are developing a micro - tpc  @xcite , which can detect three - dimensional fine tracks of charged particles .",
    "since the energy deposits of wimps to nuclei are only a few tens of kev and the range of nuclei is limited , the micro - tpc should be operated at low pressures .",
    "we are interested in operating the micro - tpc with cf@xmath44 because @xmath45f has a special sensitivity to sd interactions for its unique spin structure .",
    "we performed our first dark matter search in 2010 at kamioka laboratory using newage-0.3a detector  @xcite .",
    "the exposure was 0.524kg@xmath5days .",
    "the gas pressure was 152torr and the energy threshold was 100kev .",
    "then , second search was conducted from january 2012 to may 2012 .",
    "this exposure was 0.140kg@xmath5days with the same gas pressure as before and the energy threshold was lowered to 50kev .",
    "figure  [ newlimit ] shows the energy spectra and exclusion limits obtained through these searches .",
    "we set a limit of 800  pb for 100  gev wimps , however it is indispensable to lower the threshold and background . in this presentation",
    ", we report on the study of lowering the energy threshold via operating the detector in lower pressure .",
    "the low pressure gas study was performed using newage-0.3b detector in the surface laboratory .",
    "a schematic drawing of newage-0.3b is shown in figure  [ newdet ] the size of the @xmath46-pic ( no.sn070309-3 ) is @xmath47@xmath48 cm , and the number of pixels is 768@xmath49768 .",
    "we supply a positive high voltage to the anode electrodes of the @xmath46-pic ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "a large area gem , consisting of a 50mm - thick polyimide layer sandwiched between 5mm - thick copper electrodes is set at 5 mm above the @xmath46-pic to obtain sufficient gain .",
    "the size of the gem is 23cm@xmath4928 cm , and this gem is segmented into 8 parts to reduce the risk by discharges .",

    "the size of the drift cage is @xmath54 cm .",
    "copper electrodes are formed on the inner surface of the drift cage by every 1 cm .",
    "we supply a positive high voltage ( @xmath55 ) to the drift plane .",

    ", width=302 ]    as a beginning , the gain dependence on the bias voltages was measured to optimize operation parameters for cf@xmath56 at 76torr .",
    "we had operated the previous newage-0.3a at a gas gain of 700 with 152torr gas .",
    "accordingly , the optimum gas gain should be 1400 at 76torr , because the primary electron density became 1/2 of the previous detector . in figure",
    "[ gain ] , the obtained gas gain against @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the induction field ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the other two parameters are fixed in each plot .",
    "the gas gain increased with @xmath57 until the voltage was limited by discharged .",
    "as for @xmath60 and @xmath59 , gain curves saturate below 2000 .",
    "this gain suppression is due to the operation in low gas pressure .",
    "the mean free path of an electron in 76torr of cf@xmath56 gas is several mm , and this length is close to the thickness of the gem ( 50 mm ) , therefore the gas amplification at the gem is to be suppressed .",
    "although it turned out that the gain is saturated , we have achieved the required gas gain of 1400 .",
    "the optimized parameters are @xmath61v , @xmath62v , @xmath63v and @xmath64kv .    , @xmath60 and @xmath59 ( or @xmath65.,width=188 ]    then , the angular resolution of newage-0.3b was evaluated using nuclear tracks by neutrons from a @xmath66cf source .",
    "we determined the angular resolution by comparison of measured and simulated distributions of the recoil angle .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ angle ] .",
    "we plan to move the newage-0.3b detector to kamioka underground in 2013 . in order to operate it with lower pressure gas ,",
    "we need an even higher gas gain . as shown in above the gain",
    "is saturated at around 2000 in the current set up , therefore we have started to test a new gem which has a thickness of 100 mm instead of 50 mm .",
    "we are also improving the data acquisition system ( daq ) for recording the time - over - threshold ( tot ) of the @xmath46-pic signals in order that we can measure the energy deposition at each strip .",
    "over the past 10 years , some experiments indicate a possible wimp signal  @xcite with a lighter mass of @xmath67@xmath68 and with a spin - independent cross section of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "these positive signals have come predominantly from experiments without the capability to discriminate between electromagnetic and nuclear recoils , while other experiments that have this ability have excluded light wimps at these cross - sections  @xcite . in this presentation , a search for light wimps using a 5591.4kg@xmath5day exposure of the xmass experiment without nuclear recoil discrimination is presented .",
    "xmass is a single phase liquid xenon scintillator detector containing 1050 kg of xe in an ofhc copper vessel . as shown in figure .",
    "[ xmass_detector ] xenon scintillation light is collected by 630 hexagonal and 12 cylindrical inward - pointing hamamatsu r10789 series photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) arranged on an 80 cm diameter pentakis - dodecahedron support structure within the vessel to give a total photocathode coverage of 62.4% .",
    "these pmts view an active target region containing 835 kg of liquid xenon . in order to monitor the pmt stability and measure the trigger efficiency , eight blue leds with teflon diffusers are mounted to the support structure .",
    "there are six leds arranged along the equator and one each at the top and the bottom of the pentakis - dodecahedron . to shield the scintillator volume from external gammas , neutrons , and muon - induced backgrounds , the copper vessel is placed at the center of a @xmath7010 m @xmath49 11 m cylindrical tank filled with pure water .",
    "this volume is viewed by 72 hamamatsu r3600 20-inch pmts to provide both an active muon veto and passive shielding against these backgrounds .",
    "this is the first water cherenkov shield used in a dark matter search experiment . to perform energy and position reconstruction calibrations",

    "a more detailed description of the xmass detector is presented in  @xcite .",
    "the data used for this analysis , corresponding to 6.70 days of livetime , was taken in february 2012 with a low trigger threshold of four pmt hits  @xcite . using 122kev gammas from the @xmath73co calibration source",
    "the xenon light yield was found to be 14.7photoelectrons / kevee .",
    "this large light yield allows the analysis threshold to be lowered sufficiently for sensitivity to low mass wimps . in order to achieve optimal sensitivity ,",
    "the entire detector volume is used because fiducialization is increasingly difficult at these low energies .",
    "a sequence of data reduction is applied to remove events caused by the tail of the scintillation light distribution after energetic events ; ( 1 ) events triggered only with the liquid xenon detector are selected , ( 2 ) events that occurred within 10ms of the previous event are rejected , and ( 3 ) events whose timing distribution has an rms greater than 100ns are removed .",
    "the last cut is applied to remove cherenkov events originated from @xmath76k contamination in the pmt photocathodes ; events with more than 60% of their pmt hits occurring within the first 20ns of the event window are removed as cherenkov - like .",
    "figure  [ fig : spe ] shows simulated wimps energy spectra overlaid on the observed spectrum after the data reduction was applied .",
    "wimps are assumed to be distributed in an isothermal halo with @xmath77km / s , a galactic escape velocity of @xmath78km / s , and an average density of 0.3gev / cm@xmath4 . in order to set a conservative upper bound on the spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross section",
    ", the cross section is adjusted until the expected event rate in xmass does not exceed the observed one in any energy bin above the analysis threshold .",
