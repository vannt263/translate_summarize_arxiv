    "astrophysical @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath0 processes are thought to synthesize all nuclei heavier than the iron group .",
    "the @xmath6 ( slow neutron capture ) and @xmath7 ( rapid neutron capture ) processes proceed via neutron capture reactions followed by until the appearance of stable nuclei .",
    "while the @xmath6 process is responsible for the production of nuclei along the main @xmath8-stability line only , the @xmath7 process contributes to nuclear abundances on the main stability line as well as its neutron - rich side , not accessible to slow neutron captures .",
    "additionally , there are 35 rare nuclei along the proton - rich side of the stability line between se and hg , the so - called @xmath0 nuclei which can not be synthesized by neutron captures . instead",
    ", those nuclei have to be created by an additional process , tentatively called the @xmath0 process .",
    "a number of different ways have been suggested ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) to synthesize @xmath0 nuclei , including combinations of different processes .",
    "currently the most favored process is photodisintegration in hot ( explosive or non - explosive ) shells of massive stars , also called the @xmath9 process @xcite .",
    "this @xmath9 process is governed by mostly ( @xmath9,n ) , ( @xmath9,p ) and ( @xmath10 ) reactions on preexisting @xmath6 and @xmath7 seed nuclei in the temperature range between and .",
    "after an initial production of proton - rich isotopes by ( @xmath9,n ) reactions , the synthesis path branches to nuclides with lower charge @xmath11 at isotopes for which ( @xmath9,p ) or ( @xmath9,@xmath5 ) reactions are faster than the neutron release .",
    "the ( @xmath9,p ) and ( p,@xmath9 ) reactions are important for the production of the lower mass @xmath0 nuclei while ( @xmath9,@xmath5 ) reactions contribute to the abundances of medium and heavy mass @xmath0 nuclei @xcite .",
    "the modeling of @xmath0 ( or @xmath9 ) process nucleosynthesis requires a large network of thousands of nuclear reactions involving stable and unstable nuclei .",
    "the relevant astrophysical reaction rates derived from the reaction cross sections are necessary inputs to this network .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data for charged - particle induced reactions are scarce above iron .",
    "so far , while more proton capture reaction cross sections were studied , only a limited number of @xmath5-capture reaction cross sections , mostly in the lower mass region , are available @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 process studies are therefore based mostly on hauser - feshbach statistical models to predict the reaction rates .",
    "although the ( p,@xmath9 ) measurements generally agree with the statistical model predictions within less than a factor of two , the ( @xmath12 ) measurements are considerably lower compared to their model predictions and indicate that the measured alpha capture reaction cross sections are not correctly described by global parameterizations .

    "it has to be noted that both the potentials @xcite and @xcite have been fitted to scattering data at higher energies , @xcite to data above for a wide range of nuclei , @xcite to data above for nuclei around .",
    "the potential of @xcite , on the other hand , has been fitted to reaction data for nuclei in the mass range but was found to reproduce @xmath5-induced low - energy reaction cross sections well also for targets outside of this range .",
    "shows that the calculations with the potentials of @xcite and @xcite overestimate the ( @xmath12 ) @xmath4 factors by maximally a factor of 1.8 and 8.3 , respectively . for the potential of @xcite , although an agreement is observed at lower energies , the theoretical prediction deviates from the experimental data as the energy increases .",
    "the case of the ( @xmath5,n ) reaction is shown in .",
    "the calculations with the potential of @xcite have best agreement with the measured @xmath4 factors .",
    "the predictions with the potential of @xcite are higher than the experimental results by factors of between 1.5 and 2.1 , with closer agreement at higher energy , while the obtained values with the potential of @xcite underestimate the measurements by factors from 3.5 to 4.4 , with better agreement at lower energy .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath4 factor is overall reproduced satisfactorily by the potentials @xcite and @xcite when appropriately scaled .",
    "the potential of @xcite yields an increase in the @xmath4 factor which is too steep when going to low energy .",
    "note , however , that the predictions with the potentials of @xcite and @xcite become quite similar above 14 mev .",
    "hauser - feshbach cross sections depend on a number of nuclear properties which have to be known experimentally or predicted by a model .",
    "non - smoker@xmath14 is a global code in its standard setting , not fine - tuned to any local parameters and aiming at the best global description for a wide range of nuclei although there may be some deviations encountered when looking at individual reactions in an isolated manner . in order to understand the sensitivities and to disentangle the different contributions of nuclear properties or transitions ,",
    "it has to be remembered that the central quantities in the statistical model are transmission coefficients @xmath15 being related to averaged widths @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a nuclear level density . the cross section ( or @xmath4 factor )",
    "is related to the transmission coefficients in the entrance and exit channel @xcite @xmath18 where the subscript `` @xmath19 '' labels the total quantities which include all energetically accessible , `` open '' channels .    in our case ,",
    "the entrance channel is always the system formed by an @xmath5 particle and the target nucleus whereas the exit channel either contains a @xmath9 or a neutron plus the final nucleus , depending on the considered reaction .",
    "particle transmission coefficients are calculated by solving the schrdinger equation using an optical potential , radiative transmission coefficients include a sum of possible @xmath9 transitions with strengths derived from theoretical descriptions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) . in principle , also the nuclear level density enters both types of transmission coefficients via a sum over possible final states . however , the relevant final states are experimentally known for the reactions discussed in this paper and no theoretical nuclear level density has to be invoked . for a given reaction and projectile energy it is not always obvious which ( energy dependent ) transmission coefficients ( or average widths ) contribute most to the cross section according to the above equation and",
    "thus dominate the sensitivity .",
    "similar considerations apply to eq .",
    "( [ eq : haufesh ] ) as to the well - known dependence of breit - wigner resonant cross sections @xcite .",
    "when the widths in the numerator are of very different size and the larger width dominates the total width , the larger width will cancel out and the cross section depends only on the smaller width .",
    "the dependence is more complicated if both widths are of similar size or another open channel significantly contributes to the total width .",
    "since the widths change with energy , also the sensitivity is energy dependent .    in order to inspect the sensitivity of the astrophysical @xmath4 factors for the @xmath1in(@xmath5,@xmath9 ) and @xmath1in(@xmath5,n ) reactions to changes in the @xmath5 , neutron , and @xmath9 width ,",
    "additional calculations were performed , starting from the standard prediction ( using the potential of mcfadden and satchler @xcite ) and independently varying the widths by factors 0.5 and 2 . here , the sensitivity @xmath20 is defined as the ratio of relative change in the @xmath4 factor to one in the width , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the change in the @xmath4 factor and @xmath23 is the change in the width @xmath24 .",
    "shows the @xmath5 , neutron , and @xmath9 width sensitivities of the @xmath4 factors for the @xmath1in(@xmath5,@xmath9 ) and @xmath1in(@xmath5,n ) reactions : zero sensitivity means there is no change in the @xmath4 factor when the width is varied while @xmath25 means the @xmath4 factor changes by the same factor as the width .    at low energies , the @xmath4 factor for",
    "the @xmath1in(@xmath5,@xmath9)@xmath26sb reaction is mainly sensitive to the variation in @xmath5 width , as seen in , since the @xmath9 width is larger than the @xmath5 width due to the coulomb barrier hindering @xmath5 particles to form a compound nucleus .",
    "the coulomb repulsion is easier overcome at higher energy , leading to an increase in the @xmath5 width whereas the @xmath9 width is much less energy dependent .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity to the @xmath9 width increases with increasing energy . above the neutron threshold",
    "also the neutron width quickly increases and dominates the total width .",
    "this leads to a rescaling and keeps the sensitivity to both @xmath5 and @xmath9 width high .",
    "therefore , at the lowest energies ( and within the astrophysically relevant gamow window ) the @xmath4 factor is almost exclusively dependent on the @xmath5 width while it is sensitive to both @xmath5 and @xmath9 width above the gamow window .",
    "this is why a variation of the @xmath9 width will not change the @xmath4 factor at low energy , as shown in , whereas a change in the @xmath5 width will impact the @xmath4 factor almost equally at all energies , as seen in .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath1in(@xmath5,n ) reaction is less complex than that of the capture reaction .",
    "it is also shown in .",
    "the @xmath4 factors are sensitive to the @xmath5 width across the full energy range , similar to the case of the ( @xmath5,@xmath9 ) reaction .",
    "there is appreciable sensitivity to the neutron width only in a small energy range above the neutron threshold . towards higher energy ,",
    "the neutron width becomes large , will dominate the total width and thus cancels out .",
    "this can also be seen in which show the absolute changes of the predicted @xmath4 factors when varying the @xmath5 and neutron width , respectively .",
    "pondering the above sensitivities it becomes obvious that the ( @xmath5,n ) experiment  although astrophysically of minor importance  is useful to test the optical @xmath5 potential which enters the calculation of the @xmath5 widths .",
    "the capture reaction shows a more complicated dependence on _ three _ widths , the @xmath5 , @xmath9 , _ and _ neutron width . unfortunately , the @xmath1in(@xmath5,n ) reaction does not allow to test the optical potential at astrophysically relevant energies because of the neutron threshold at positive energy",
    "contrary to the first impression one might get from , a combined study of reveals that the potential of @xcite actually reproduces the data best . only a slight rescaling is needed to reproduce the @xmath4 factor of the ( @xmath5,n ) reaction .",
    "only the data point at the lowest energy may hint at an incorrect energy dependence towards even lower energies .",
    "however , this may also be caused by an incorrect neutron width just above the channel opening .",
    "taking into account the above conclusion , the measured capture @xmath4 factor shows that the @xmath9 width seems to be predicted too large .",
    "however , a rescaling of the @xmath9 width will not affect the @xmath4 factor at the two lowest measured energies ( see ) .",
    "at these two energies , the neutron width is also small and may have an impact . as shown in , to decrease the low - energy @xmath4 factor of the ( @xmath5,n ) reaction and to bring it in accordance with the data , a decrease of the neutron width",
    "is needed . however",
    ", a smaller neutron width would lead to an even larger @xmath4 factor at low energy in the ( @xmath5,@xmath9 ) reaction because in the capture reaction the neutron width only appears in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : haufesh ] ) as part of the total width .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath5 width is predicted too large at the smallest energies and this can account for the low - energy behavior in both reactions .",
    "interestingly , it appears as if the potential of @xcite provides the required @xmath5 width at those lowest energies ( see ) although its energy dependence is not suited to reproduce the ( @xmath5,n ) data at slightly higher energy ( see ) . to explain the ( @xmath5,@xmath9 ) across the full range of measured energies",
    ", a combination of a smaller @xmath5 width and a smaller @xmath9 width can reproduce the data .",
    "using the activation method , the cross sections of the reaction @xmath1in(@xmath5,@xmath9)@xmath26sb was measured from effective center - of - mass energy and the ones of the reaction @xmath1in(@xmath5,n)@xmath13sb in the energy range .",
    "this is at the upper end of the astrophysically relevant energy window .",
    "the results were compared to hauser - feshbach calculations with different optical @xmath5+nucleus potentials .",
    "a sensitivity study was performed by varying particle and @xmath9 widths .",
    "we conclude that the combined ( @xmath5,@xmath9 ) and ( @xmath5,n ) data is acceptably well described by the potential of @xcite , except at the lowest energies where we see an indication that the energy dependence is incorrect and leads to overestimated @xmath4 factors .",
    "it appears as if there is a transition from a potential close to the one of @xcite to a potential close to the one of @xcite within the gamow window .",
    "we also found that the predicted @xmath9 width is too large but this is irrelevant at astrophysical energies .",
    "since the reverse rate varies in the same manner as the forward rate according to the principle of detailed balance , the photodisintegration rate will also become lower when the low - energy ( @xmath5,@xmath9 ) @xmath4 factors become smaller @xcite .",
    "although @xmath1 in can be produced by @xmath26sb(@xmath9,@xmath5)@xmath1 in , as studied here , the direct impact of a changed rate on @xmath0 process calculations will be limited because the @xmath26sb(@xmath9,n)@xmath13sb channel is considerably faster @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs for the destruction of @xmath1 in by ( @xmath9,@xmath5 ) and ( @xmath9,n ) reactions .",
    "nevertheless , problems with the optical alpha potential and the prediction of low - energy rates similar to the ones found here are expected for nuclei comprising ( @xmath9,@xmath5 ) branchings in the @xmath0 process path .",
    "further measurements to lower energy with @xmath1 in and other targets are required to globally determine the actual energy dependence of the optical @xmath5 potential at low energy and thus improve the prediction of astrophysical @xmath4 factors and reaction rates .",
