    "emission spectroscopy at extreme- and far - ultraviolet wavelengths will provide the key to our eventual understanding of the origin , distribution , and physical processes of the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "observing diffuse interstellar emission at these wavelengths has , however , proven technically challenging , and only a handful of detections have been obtained to date @xcite .",
    "thus , the recent observation of diffuse galactic  emission with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ by @xcite is both exciting , because of what it can tell us about the state and distribution of hot gas in the galaxy , and frustrating , because of the long integration times ( @xmath13 ksec ) required .",
    "we are therefore pleased to report the serendipitous detection of diffuse galactic  emission in two ( relatively ) short _ fuse",
    "_  observations of the coma and virgo clusters . combining our emission - line intensities toward virgo with the  column density measured toward m87 ,",
    "we constrain the physical properties of the emitting gas .",
    "these results bode well for future efforts to map the sky at far - uv ( fuv ) wavelengths .",
    "_ fuse _  comprises four separate optical systems .",
    "two employ lif optical coatings and are sensitive to wavelengths from 990 to 1187  , while the other two use sic coatings , which provide reflectivity to wavelengths as short as 905  .",
    "the four channels overlap between 990 and 1070  . for a complete description of _ fuse",
    "_ , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the _ fuse _  spectrum of the coma cluster was obtained in 17 separate exposures on 2000 june 18 and 19 .",
    "each exposure was centered on 12@xmath1459@xmath15490 , + 275746  ( j2000 , or @xmath16 in galactic coordinates ) , near the center of the coma cluster .",
    "the total exposure time was 28608 s , with 23553 s obtained during orbital night .",
    "we use the entire 29-ksec data set in our analysis .",
    "our spectrum of the virgo cluster is a combination of data from two locations near the cluster center .",
    "two exposures , centered on 12@xmath1431@xmath15073 , + 122346  ( @xmath17 ) and totaling 2242 s , were obtained on 2000 june 13 .",
    "seven exposures , centered on 12@xmath1431@xmath15134 , + 122210  ( @xmath18 ) and totaling 8688 s , were obtained on 2000 june 17 .",
    "the total integration time is 10,930 s , all of it during orbital night .",
    "all observations were made through the 30  @xmath3 30  low - resolution ( lwrs ) aperture .",
    "the data - reduction procedures applied to these data are discussed in detail in @xcite and are not repeated here .    while the resolution of the _ fuse _  spectrograph is approximately 15 km s@xmath6  for a point source , diffuse emission filling the lwrs aperture yields a line profile that is well approximated by a top - hat function with a width of @xmath10 106 km s@xmath6 .",
    "our spectra are quite faint , so we bin the coma data by 8 detector pixels , or about 15.5 km s@xmath6 . approximately 7 of these bins are required to span a diffuse emission feature , providing ample sensitivity to its line profile .",
    "we bin the data from the shorter virgo observation by 16 pixels .",
    "we distinguish between detector pixels and 8- or 16-pixel bins throughout this letter . because of the wide disparity in the effective areas of the various detector    0.3 in    segments @xcite , combining faint spectra from different segments does not significantly improve their signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we thus use data only from the segment with the highest effective area at the wavelength of interest .",
    "the _ fuse _  flux calibration , based on theoretical models of white - dwarf stellar atmospheres , is believed accurate to about 10% @xcite .",
    "corrections to the nominal _ fuse _  wavelength scale are derived from the measured positions of airglow features in the day - time coma spectrum and are good to about 0.01  .",
    "error bars are assigned to the data assuming gaussian statistics , then smoothed by 9 bins to remove small - scale features in the error spectrum without significantly changing its shape .",

    "the observed profile of a diffuse emission feature represents a convolution of its intrinsic profile , assumed to be a gaussian , with the 106 km s@xmath6  top - hat function discussed above .",
    "free parameters in the fit are the level and slope of the continuum ( assumed linear ) and the intensity , wavelength , and intrinsic fwhm of each emission line .",
    "the observed continuum level is consistent with the dark - count rate determined from unilluminated regions of the detector @xcite .    the model that best fits our coma spectrum between 1030 and 1040 yields a @xmath31 of 166.7 for 173 degrees of freedom , including the  @xmath32 airglow line .",

    "is straightforward .",
    "we use the arguments of @xcite to reject four alternative explanations for the emission observed in the 10301040   region of the lif 1a spectrum : scattered light in the cross - dispersion direction on the detector , atmospheric airglow emission , solar  contamination , and h@xmath36  fluorescence . furthermore",

    "we list in table 2 those features that are significant at the 3-@xmath35 level by both tests , with three exceptions : first , we discard any features detected in known stray - light stripes ( see @xcite ) .",

    "neither instrumental calibration uncertainties nor contamination by emission from other species can explain this effect .",
    "more likely , the apparent velocity differences are optical - depth effects . because the optical depth of the 1038   line is half that of the 1032   line , the 1038   flux that we observe may have been emitted in regions far beyond those responsible for the 1032   flux .",
