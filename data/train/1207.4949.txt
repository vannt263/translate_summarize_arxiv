    "radio and optical flux , polarization , and timing information along with proper motions , have made it possible to construct likely scenarios for the dynamics and location of emission in the various different wavebands .",

    "the large scale magnetic field may dissipate if the regular magnetic structure is destroyed as a result of a global mhd instability , the kink instability being the most plausible candidate ( lyubarskii 1992 , 1999 ; eichler 1993 ; spruit et al 1997 ; begelman 1998 ; giannios & spruit 2006 ) .",

    "it is known from the field of thermonuclear fusion that the nonlinear development of the kink instability is different for external and internal kink modes ( e.g. bateman 1978 ) .",
    "the external instability develops in a current carrying plasma filament surrounded by a vacuum magnetic field ; this instability is disruptive . in space conditions , such a configuration is not relevant because some amount of plasma is present everywhere and the magnetic field is frozen into this plasma . in this case",
    "the so - called internal kink instability develops .",
    "the internal kink mode develops inside a resonance surface on which helicity of the magnetic field lines matches that of the eigenmode . in dissipation - less mhd",
    "this instability is known to saturate if the toroidal field is small compared to the poloidal one ( e.g. bateman 1978 ) .",
    "finite resistivity makes the internal kink mode disruptive . however , the corresponding time - scale , although short in laboratory devices , significantly exceeds the alfvn time - scale and is too long to disrupt a fast outflow .",
    "on the other hand , the toroidal field is large in astrophysical magnetized outflows and beyond the alfvn surface the toroidal field exceeds the poloidal field . therefore the question of whether the kink instability is able to disrupt the jet s structure and trigger violent magnetic dissipation remains open .",
    "only fully 3d simulations allow proper study of the kink instability in the non - linear stage . at this time",
    "only a few 3d simulations of relativistic , magnetized jets have been performed , and the results are still controversial .",
    "mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) simulated the generation and propagation of a relativistic highly magnetized jet and found no significant development of non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "on the contrary , mignone et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found strong wiggling of the jet .",
    "the discrepancy may be attributed to the difference in the setup .",
    "mignone et al .  ( 2010 ) assumed that the magnetic field was purely toroidal , whereas mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) simulated jet launching from a rotating magnetized configuration and their jet contained both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components .    in a previous paper ( mizuno et al .",
    "2009 ) , we considered helically magnetized static plasma columns ( or more generally rigidly moving flows considered in the proper reference frame ) .",
    "simulation results showed that the initial configuration is strongly distorted but not disrupted by the cd kink instability .",
    "we also investigated the influence of a velocity shear surface on the linear and non - linear development of cd kink instability of force - free helical magnetic equilibria in 3d and found that helically distorted density structure propagates along the jet with speed and flow structure dependent on the radius of the velocity shear surface relative to the characteristic radius of the helically twisted force - free magnetic field ( mizuno et al .",
    "recently oneill et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have also investigated the cd kink instability in a local , co - moving frame using the 3d relativistic mhd module within the athena code ( beckwith & stone 2011 ) .",
    "their results for a static , force - free configuration are consistent with ours .",
    "they also studied rotating jets with a purely toroidal magnetic field , the hoop stress being balanced by the pressure and centrifugal force , and found that in this case , the instability brings the system into a turbulent state .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the nonlinear behavior of the cd kink instability in a differentially rotating jet .",
    "as in our previous studies , we perform simulations in a reference frame co - moving with the jet so that the plasma velocities in our frame are only mildly relativistic ( in the general case of differentially moving flow , there is no frame of reference where the velocities vanish ) . as our goal is to investigate step by step the role of different factors in the development of the instability , here",
    "we concentrate on the differential rotation and neglect for a while the sideways expansion of the jet even though the last could presumably slow down or even suppress the instability .",
    "these effects deserve a separate study . for a while",
    "we assume that the jet expands slowly enough .",
    "we consider configurations close to the force - free equilibrium of a rotating jet , in which poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields are comparable and the transverse equilibrium is maintained by a balance between the hoop stress , pressure of the poloidal field and the electric force where the centrifugal force and the gas pressure remain small .",
    "our setup is motivated by an analysis of the structure of poynting dominated jets ( lyubarsky 2009 ) . even though the magnetic field in the jet is predominantly toroidal , the poloidal field can not in general",
    "be neglected because one has in fact to compare the fields in the comoving frame where the toroidal field is much less than in the lab frame . in cylindrically equilibrium configurations ,",
    "the poloidal and toroidal fields are comparable in the comoving frame .",
    "the jet structure relaxes to a locally equilibrium configuration if the jet is narrow enough so that the alfvn crossing time is less than the proper propagation time .",
    "an important point is that only such jets could be subject to the kink instability because the characteristic instability time - scale is larger than the alfvn crossing time .",
    "therefore stability analysis is relevant only for jets with non - negligible poloidal field .",
    "the poloidal field can be neglected only if the jet expands rapidly enough so that the alfvn crossing time exceeds the proper jet propagation time ; then the jet is unable to relax to an equilibrium configuration and therefore the hoop stress remains unbalanced .",
    "such jets can indeed be considered as composed from concentric magnetic loops ; however , no global mhd instabilities can develop in causally disconnected flows therefore we do not consider such configurations here",
    ".    note that causality considerations ( in terms of alfvn crossing time ) are of primary importance even in non - relativistic jets , see analysis by moll et al .",
    "an important difference is that beyond the alfvn point , a non - relativistic jet could not be in transverse equilibrium because the toroidal field exceeds the poloidal one and the hoop stress is not counterbalanced by the electric force as in relativistic flows . in non - relativistic jets ,",
    "the flow reaches approximate energy equipartition already near the alfvn point and beyond this point , where the kink instability could develop , most of the energy is already transferred to the plasma ( moll et al .",
    "2008 , moll 2009 ) .",
    "it is a specific property of relativistic flows that well beyond the alfvn point , the flow could remain poynting dominated and the transverse structure of the flow could be close to that in cylindrically equilibrium magnetic configurations .    in this paper , we focus on the temporal development of cd kink instability in a differentially rotating relativistic jet with periodic box .",
    "in this situation , we follow the evolution of a few wavelengths of instability in a reference frame within a small simulation domain .",
    "many previous relativistic and non - relativistic mhd simulations of jet formation and propagation ( e.g. , nakamura & meier 2004 ; nakamura et al . 2007 ;",
    "moll et al . 2008 ; moll 2009 ; mckinney & blandford 2009 ; mignone et al .",
    "2010 ) have followed the spatial properties of development of kink instability in the jet . even though only such simulations could take into account properly real conditions , it is difficult to figure out a role of different factors and therefore to gain physical insights",
    ". therefore we choose the investigation of temporal development of instabilities in an infinite cylindrical jet . at this step ,",
    "we concentrate on the role of the differential rotation , which introduces an important physical factor : the net electric force , which opposes to the hoop stress",
    ". therefore differentially rotating jets could be in the transverse equilibrium even if the transverse gradient of the poloidal field is zero .",
    "the linear stability analysis shows ( istomin & pariev 1994 , 1996 ; lyubarskii 1999 ) that the instability growth rate goes to zero when the transverse gradient of the poloidal field vanishes ( but the poloidal field has to be comparable with the toroidal field in the comoving frame ) .",
    "here we investigate dependence of the non - linear development of the instability on the transverse structure of the jet .",
    "we demonstrate that the instability could become disruptive only if the poloidal field significantly decreases outwards from the axis .",
    "when the profile of the poloidal field is shallow , the instability develops slowly and eventually saturates .",
    "we describe the numerical method and setup used for our simulations in  2 , present our results in  3 , in  4 compare our results to instability expectations and conclude .",
    "in order to study time evolution of the cd kink instability in the relativistic mhd ( rmhd ) regime , we use the 3d grmhd code `` raishin '' in cartesian coordinates .",
    "raishin is based on a @xmath6 formalism of the general relativistic conservation laws of particle number and energy - momentum , maxwell s equations , and ohm s law with no electrical resistance ( ideal mhd condition ) in a curved spacetime ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the raishin code , a conservative , high - resolution shock - capturing scheme is employed .",
    "the numerical fluxes are calculated using the hll approximate riemann solver , and flux - interpolated constrained transport ( flux - ct ) is used to maintain a divergence - free magnetic field .",
    "we have used the mc slope - limiter scheme ( second order ) for reconstruction in the simulations performed in this paper .",
    "the raishin code performs special relativistic calculations in minkowski spacetime by choosing the appropriate metric .",
    "the raishin code has proven to be accurate to second order and has passed a number of numerical tests including highly relativistic cases and highly magnetized cases in both special and general relativity ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006 , 2011b ) .",
    "the aim of our simulations is to elucidate the impact of the kink instability on poynting dominated jets .",
    "the basic picture we keep in our minds is the following .",
    "a rotating black hole is embedded in a large - scale magnetic field supported by currents flowing in the accretion disk .",
    "a magnetized wind flows outwards both from the black hole and from the disk but most of the energy is transported along the field lines threading the horizon and , maybe , the inner part of the disk ( blandford 1976 ; lovelace 1976 ; blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "the kink instability comes into play when the toroidal field in the comoving frame becomes comparable to the poloidal field .",
    "this occurs at distances small compared to the outer disk radius ( but beyond the  light cylinder \" radius ) ; the flow in this region may be considered as quasi - cylindrical with the magnetic field having a maximum within some core and gradually decreasing in the lateral direction .",
    "no external medium reaches this zone .",
    "therefore we consider cylindrical magnetic configurations with a well - defined core and extended wings .",
    "our goal is to understand how the kink instability affects the structure and dynamics of the core where most of the magnetic energy is concentrated .    in our simulations",
    "we choose a force - free helical magnetic field for the initial configuration ( mizuno et al .",
    "a force - free configuration is a reasonable choice for the poynting dominated jet . in general , the force - free equilibrium of a cylindrical rotating jet is described by the equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the speed of light . in particular",

    "recall that the centrifugal and pressure forces at our setup are small but not negligible so that our initial force - free configuration ( eqs . 1 - 4 )",
    "is not a true equilibrium even though close to it .",
    "therefore a little relaxation occurs for a few alfvn times .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "6 shows that the kink instability comes into play at @xmath110 , well after the relaxation finishes .",
    "the evolution of @xmath103 in the simulations shows that a characteristic time for the development of the instability is about a dozen alfvn crossing times , i.e. , exponential growth from a minimum near @xmath111 to a maximum at @xmath112 .",
    "this agrees with the general estimate of the maximum instability growth rate , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the core radius .",
    "the exact coefficient depends on the transverse distribution of the parameters ; specifically for constant pitch with @xmath63 and uniform density , appl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found @xmath115 .",
    "note that this estimate is made in the frame moving with the kink ; for a relativistic jet , the growth rate of the instability in the lab frame decreases by the lorentz factor ( lyubarskii 1999 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath107 is opposite to the time evolution of the kinetic energy as it should be because the cd kink instability develops at the expense of the magnetic energy .    in the internal kink instability ,",
    "unstable modes match the helicity of the magnetic field lines so that the wavelength of unstable perturbations is determined by the magnetic pinch , @xmath116 ( e.g. bateman 1978 ) .",
    "this condition remains valid also in relativistic flows ( lyubarsky 1999 ) , therefore the pitch could be small there , like in the configuration considered by appl et al ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "therefore the pitch , as well as the wavelength of the unstable perturbations , could not be less than the core radius in this case .",
    "in relativistic flows , the toroidal field could be larger than the poloidal because the hoop stress could be nearly balanced by the electric force ; then the pitch could be less than the jet radius . in highly relativistic jets ,",
    "the toroidal field significantly exceeds the poloidal one in the lab frame ; therefore the wavelength of unstable perturbations are small , in the lab frame , as compared with the jet radius .",
    "this may be thought of as a relativistic contraction of unstable loops . ] .",
    "our simulations indeed show a decrease of the unstable wavelength with decreasing pitch .",
    "figure 7 shows three dimensional density isosurfaces and figure 8 shows two dimensional images of the xz - plane at @xmath100 for the constant pitch cases for the angular velocity amplitudes @xmath117 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .    in the @xmath118 case ,",
    "the behavior of the growing kink in the linear and nonlinear phase is very similar to that in the @xmath58 case . in both cases ,",
    "only the @xmath99 kink mode wavelength grows .",
    "the propagation speed of the kink is @xmath119 and slightly slower than the maximum axial drift speed of @xmath120 . in the @xmath70 case ,",
    "both @xmath99 and @xmath121 kink mode wavelengths grow ( see fig . 7c and 8c ) .",
    "this is because the pitch decreases with the increasing @xmath10 and the shorter @xmath121 wavelength is now unstable . in the nonlinear phase",
    ", only the @xmath99 kink mode wavelength is excited far from the axis where the pitch is larger .",
    "the propagation speed of the kink is @xmath122 and the initial maximum axial drift speed is @xmath123 . in the case @xmath124 , one can also see @xmath99 and @xmath121 kink mode wavelengths growing . in the nonlinear phase , growth of the cd kink instability",
    "produces a complicated radially expanding structure as a result of the coupling of multiple wavelengths , and the cylindrical jet structure is almost disrupted .",
    "this indicates that taking into account the coupling of multiple unstable wavelengths is crucial to determining whether the jet is eventually disrupted . in this case",
    "the propagation speed of the kink is @xmath125 , and the initial maximum axial drift speed is @xmath126 .    in order to investigate multiple wavelength growth and coupling in moderate angular velocity cases ( @xmath117 and @xmath60 ) ,",
    "we have performed simulations using longer simulation box ( @xmath127 for @xmath117 and @xmath128 for @xmath70 ) and the results are shown in figure 9 .    in this longer simulation box",
    "we now see development of both the @xmath129 and @xmath121 kink mode wavelengths in the @xmath117 simulation where in the shorter box only the @xmath129 kink mode wavelength was observed .",
    "note that the @xmath99 and @xmath121 wavelengths are intrinsically longer in the longer simulation box .",
    "growth of the multiple wavelengths leads to a considerably different structure at longer times as a result of multiple wavelength interaction .",
    "at least initially the result of the @xmath70 simulation in the longer simulation box looks similar to that of the @xmath70 simulation in the shorter simulation box .",
    "however , the structure is again considerably different at longer times even though two wavelengths were excited initially in the shorter box . here",
    "the difference occurs because the shorter simulation box only allowed the @xmath121 wavelength to grow near to the axis .",
    "these differences serve to show how important the coupling of multiple wavelengths can be to the long term development of the instability in the non - linear stage , and we see that coupling between multiple wavelengths can lead to disruption of cylindrical jet structure in the nonlinear stage .      according to the linear theory of the kink instability in relativistic force - free jets , the instability growth rate decreases with decreasing outward gradient of the poloidal magnetic field and becomes zero when the poloidal field is homogeneous ( istomin & pariev 1996 ; lyubarskii 1999 ) . in order to study the influence of the transverse poloidal magnetic field profile",
    ", we have performed simulations with four different poloidal field profile parameters , @xmath18 .",
    "we choose @xmath130 which leads to increase in the pitch , p , because it is expected that in jets , the magnetic field lines are less tightly wrapped with radius .",
    "a density isosurface for @xmath131 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 with @xmath70 is shown in figure 10 .",
    "for @xmath131 , a helical density structure with the @xmath121 kink mode wavelength develops near the axis by @xmath132 . in the nonlinear phase , some expanding helical density structure associated with the @xmath99 wavelength",
    "is seen at large radius but near the axis , cylindrical density structure remains .",
    "the evolution is similar to the @xmath133 case but the evolution time is longer . for @xmath134 , helically twisted density structure with the @xmath121 wavelength",
    "is clearly seen around the transition from the linear to the nonlinear phase . in the nonlinear phase",
    ", the helical density structure slowly expands radially .",
    "for @xmath135 , helically twisted density structure does not expand significantly in the nonlinear phase .",
    "thus our simulations indicate that for smaller @xmath18 , the cd kink instability can grow only near axis and non - linear growth is suppressed .",
    "we note that smaller @xmath18 cases have stronger magnetic fields and faster initial rotation .",
    "the faster rotation near the axis creates some numerical noise near the axis at early simulation times .",
    "however , this numerical noise does not affect our simulation results .",
    "figure 11 shows the evolution of the volume - averaged relativistic energies determined within a cylinder of radius @xmath102 for @xmath131 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 with @xmath70 .    for @xmath131 ( dotted lines ) ,",
    "the evolution profile is similar to that of the @xmath63 case although the scaling is different .",
    "compared to the @xmath63 case , the transition from the linear to the nonlinear phase occurs slightly later ( @xmath136 ) . for @xmath134 ( dashed lines ) ,",
    "the growth rate is much lower than for the @xmath63 case .",
    "the linear growth phase lasts until @xmath137 . in the nonlinear phase , kinetic and magnetic energies do not decrease .",
    "this indicates non - linear stabilization and structure developed initially is maintained in the nonlinear stage .",
    "for @xmath135 ( dash - dotted lines ) , transition to the nonlinear phase happens at a lower maximum value of @xmath138 than for the @xmath134 case .",
    "the growth rate in the @xmath135 case is lower than that in the @xmath134 case .",
    "these simulations with different transverse poloidal magnetic field distribution , show that the transverse poloidal magnetic field distribution strongly affects growth of the cd kink instability . in accordance with the linear theory",
    ", the instability grows slower with decreasing outward gradient of the poloidal field and the simulations show that the instability can saturate in this case .",
    "we have investigated the influence of rotation and differential motion on the linear and nonlinear development of the cd kink instability of poynting dominated jets in 3d rmhd simulations .",
    "this work provides an extension of our previous study using a static column ( mizuno et al .",
    "2009 ) , and both studies can be considered to represent cd kink instability development in a comoving frame .",
    "our combined studies show that results are strongly affected by the choice of the transverse gas density and pressure profile where the constant gas density and pressure in the previous static column simulations led to matter domination in the periphery where the magnetic field is smaller than in the core .",
    "for this reason , the growth of the cd kink instability was suppressed in the nonlinear phase in the earlier static simulations . in the present paper , we have taken the gas density and the pressure to decrease outwards together with the magnetic field so that the system is magnetically dominated everywhere .",
    "according to a linear analysis of the stability of relativistic force - free jets ( istomin & pariev 1996 ; lyubarskii 1999 ) , the growth rate of the kink instability decreases with the decreasing gradient of the poloidal magnetic field and becomes zero if the poloidal field is homogeneous .",
    "this is partially a relativistic effect because in non - relativistic force - free flows , for the hoop stress to be balanced by the the poloidal field requires a gradient in the poloidal field and the poloidal field can not be constant ( with the exception of singular cases like @xmath139 ) . in the relativistic case ,",
    "the hoop stress can also be partially balanced by the electric force ( lhs of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) and thus the poloidal field gradient can be smaller than in the non - relativistic case or even vanish .",
    "our simulations confirm the strong dependence of the instability on the lateral distribution of the poloidal magnetic field ; the last is controlled , in our setup , by the parameter @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "2 ) . for @xmath140 , which corresponds to a significant decrease of the poloidal field in the jet core , unstable perturbations grow until the initial cylindrical structure is disrupted , with the disruption caused by the non - linear interaction of multiple growing wavelengths . note that the unstable perturbations match the helical structure of the magnetic field lines so the wavelength of unstable perturbations is determined by the magnetic pitch . in relativistic jet flows , the toroidal field can significantly exceed the poloidal one ( because of the presence of the electric force ) , the pitch can be much less than the jet radius , and multiple wavelengths are inevitably excited",
    ". however , we find that a decrease in @xmath18 and accompanying more homogeneous poloidal field leads to slower perturbation growth in accord with linear stability analysis , non - linear saturation of the instability , and the initial cylindrical structure is not disrupted .",
    "our simulations were performed in the frame comoving with the jet . in a differentially moving flow , any frame in which the velocities are mildly relativistic may be considered as a comoving frame .",
    "the instability develops for a time @xmath141 in the comoving frame therefore in the lab frame , the instability develops at a scale @xmath142 , where @xmath43 is the jet lorentz factor .",
    "the instability could develop only if the alfvn crossing time is less than the proper propagation time , @xmath143 one can show ( lyubarsky 2009 ) that such jets should be narrow enough , @xmath144 , and at any distance from the source , the structure of the flow in these jets is the same as the structure of an appropriate cylindrical equilibrium configuration .",
    "this justifies our using equilibrium cylindrical configurations as an initial setup for the stability analysis .",
    "when propagating through a medium with decreasing pressure jets expand . condition ( 12 ) is satisfied if the external pressure decreases with the distance not faster than @xmath145 . in this case",
    "the flow is accelerated such that @xmath146 until the kinetic energy of the flow becomes comparable with the magnetic energy ( i.e. , until @xmath147 , the ratio of the poynting to the plasma energy fluxes , drops to about unity ) .",
    "after equipartition is reached , the flow is accelerated extremely slowly so that the true matter dominated stage ( when @xmath147 drops to , say , 0.1 ) is reached only at unreasonably large distances ( lyubarsky 2010a ) .",
    "simulations of jet launching by a spinning accreting black hole reveal that in real poynting dominated jets , the poloidal field is very close to uniform ( tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "according to our results , the cd kink instability only weakly develops in this case .",
    "this explains why mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) did not observe the kink instability in their simulations .",
    "however , when the jet is accelerated up to @xmath148 , the poloidal flux is concentrated towards the axis ( beskin & nokhrina 2009 ; lyubarsky 2009 ) .",
    "we have shown that such a configuration is subject to disruptive kink instability and therefore our study suggests that poynting dominated jets are accelerated up to approximate equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic energies and then the regular structure is disrupted by the kink instability . since the jet is already highly relativistic at this stage , the flow remains collimated but the magnetic energy is efficiently dissipated .",
    "recall that such a scenario is valid only for jets satisfying @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the opening angle of the jet .",
    "this condition is rather restrictive ; for example it is violated in gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. tchekhovskoy et al . 2010 ) . in agns ,",
    "the observations show a large scatter in @xmath151 , the median value being @xmath152 ( pushkarev et al .",
    "one can speculate that the violent magnetic dissipation triggered by the cd kink instability gives rise to the flaring activity of blazars .",
    "the observations suggest that the flares can occur relatively far from the central engine , at the distance of hundreds and thousands gravitational radii ( tavecchio et al .",
    "this agrees with our conjecture that the jet is first accelerated till @xmath148 and only then does the kink instability come into play .",
    "the effect of jet rotation considered in the present instability study provides a more realistic setup than that provided by a static plasma column ( rigidly moving flow ) .",
    "however , we still have not included the lateral spatial expansion expected for relativistic jets .",
    "jet expansion has strong consequences for the behavior of instabilities on jets modeled as cylinders of constant radius .",
    "jet expansion has a stabilizing effect , since magnetic instabilities become ineffective when the alfvn speed drops below the lateral expansion speed of the jet .",
    "currently only a few non - relativistic mhd simulations have explored the effect of jet expansion on the development of cd kink instability ( moll et al . 2008 ; moll 2009 ) . in future work",
    ", we plan to investigate the effect of jet expansion on the development of cd kink instability in the relativistic mhd regime .    in our current and past simulation work",
    ", we assume the ideal mhd condition .",
