    "the first semiclassical method , the wkb method@xcite , was published almost simultaneously with the publication of the schrdinger equation in 1926 . since then , semiclassical methods have continued to attract great interest for two primary reasons .",
    "first , semiclassical methods give insight into classical - quantum correspondence .",
    "second , for large systems they hold the promise of significant computational advantages relative to full quantum mechanical calculations . in particular , in recent years much progress has been made in the chemical physics community in developing _ time - dependent _ semiclassical methods that are accurate and efficient for multidimensional systems . by semiclassical methods ,",
    "one generally means the calculation of a quantum mechanical wavefunction or propagator via the propagation of classical ( or classical - like ) trajectories .",
    "mathematically speaking , semiclassical methods cast the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , which is a pde , in terms of odes related to classical equations of motion . from a physical point of view",
    ", the semiclassical methods try to circumvent the non - locality of quantum mechanics .",
    "in this paper we present a new method that is to some extent a cross between a numerical grid method and a semiclassical method .",
    "the method is derived by inserting a trial form @xmath0 into the tdse and calculating the time - dependent complex phase at a _",
    "stationary _ position .",
    "since the method yields an approximate solution of the tdse at a fixed position it is a cousin of grid methods .",
    "however , we compute @xmath1 by solving a hierarchy of spatial derivatives of @xmath1 along a stationary trajectory ; information from the neighboring trajectories is incorporated only through the initial conditions .",
    "this property makes the approximation local from the quantum mechanical point of view , and hence a cousin of semiclassical methods .",
    "we refer to the new method as the zero - velocity complex action method ( zevca ) since it employs a complex phase ( action ) and stationary trajectories .",
    "the substitution of @xmath0 as an ansatz in the tdse is the same starting point as several methods that are based on the hydrodynamic and bohmian formulations of quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "more specifically , zevca is related to the derivative propagation method@xcite , the trajectory stability method@xcite and bohmian mechanics with complex action@xcite . as in the case with zevca",
    ", these methods incorporate equations of motion for a hierarchy of spatial derivatives of the phase ( and amplitude ) that are calculated along trajectories .",
    "but unlike zevca , in these other approaches the time dependent trajectories _ propagate _ in either real or complex configuration space .",
    "the zevca formulation employs fixed trajectories that yield the time dependence of the wavefunction at a _ fixed _ , _ predetermined _ position in configuration space . in reference @xcite section 7.2",
    ", wyatt considers the solution of the global hydrodynamic equations of quantum mechanics on fixed grid points ( eulerian grid ) but he dismisses its usefulness as a numerical tool . the zevca formulation shows how to obtain useful output of a local propagation at a single grid point .    for a number of quantum mechanical calculations , such as thermal rates or tunneling probabilities , knowledge of the wavefunction in all of configuration space is unnecessary : these quantities can be calculated by data at a single position or a small interval of space .",
    "for such calculations , zevca has a significant numerical advantage since it produces local information at a predetermined position .",
    "the first application of zevca that we present in this paper is the calculation of tunneling probabilities ; zevca is well suited for this calculation since tunneling probabilities can be calculated from a time integral of the probability current at a fixed position . the second application is the calculation of the lowest energy eigenvalue of a bound potential . for this application",
    "we make a minor modification to the zevca formulation to adapt it to imaginary time propagation . in both applications",
    "we calculate the results by propagating _",
    "just a single trajectory_.    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ form ]",
    "we formulate zevca for the real time schrdinger propagator ( section [ schro ] ) and the imaginary time schrdinger propagator ( section [ boltzmann ] ) . since the multi - dimensional representation of zevca is somewhat more complicated , we present only the one - dimensional derivation .",
    "section [ num_app ] is dedicated to the implementation of zevca for the derivation of tunneling probabilities ( [ tunnel ] ) and the first energy eigenvalue of a bound potential ( [ lowene ] ) . in section [ summary ]",
    "we present our summary and concluding remarks .",
    "we start by inserting the ansatz@xcite @xmath2,\\ ] ] into the tdse @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a complex function , @xmath5 is planck s constant divided by @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the mass of the particle and @xmath8 is the potential energy function . the subscripts denote partial derivatives .",
    "the result is a quantum hamilton - jacobi equation@xcite @xmath9 where we recognize the classical hamilton - jacobi equation on the lhs . on",
    "the rhs is an additional non - classical term that can be referred to as a `` quantum potential '' .",
    "our aim is to solve eq.([st1 ] ) using the method of characteristics .",
    "this method is usually applied to the solution of first order pdes .",
    "the underlying idea of the method of characteristics is to transform a single pde ( or a set of pdes ) to a set of odes that are solved along a characteristic curve .",
    "the characteristic is defined by setting a dependence between the independent variables of the pde ( or pdes ) , in our case @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "zevca makes the simplest possible choice for the characteristics : @xmath12 i.e. the characteristics are trajectories that remain at a constant position .",
    "the time dependence of the phase along the trajectory is given by inserting @xmath4 in the lagrangian time derivative defined as @xmath13 the choice we made in eq.([dxdt ] ) equates the lagrangian time derivative and the partial time derivative @xmath14 .",
    "the result of the substitution is @xmath15 where we have used eq.([st1 ] ) .",
    "the integration of eq.@xmath16 requires @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "note that the initial position @xmath19 acts as a parameter .",
    "defining @xmath20\\equiv \\left.\\frac{\\partial^{n } s}{\\partial x^{n}}\\right|_{[x(0),t]},\\ ] ] we can write a general equation of motion for @xmath21 \\ \\forall n$ ] in the following manner .",
    "we take the @xmath22 spatial partial derivative of eq.([st1 ] ) @xmath23 and insert the result in the time derivative of @xmath24 @xmath25 where we have assumed that the time and spatial derivatives are interchangeable .",
    "equation ( [ dsndt ] ) reveals that the equation of motion of @xmath24 depends on the result of two subsequent equations ( by the dependence on @xmath26 ) and on all prior equations by the term @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the general characteristic solution of eq.([st1 ] ) yields an infinite hierarchy of odes defined by eqs.([dsndt ] ) where @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , we have converted eq.([st1 ] ) to an infinite set of local but coupled odes that generate the time dependence of the complex phase and its spatial derivatives at position @xmath19 .",
    "an approximation can now be obtained by truncating the set at some @xmath29 ; this is done by setting @xmath30 .",

    "the mapping of @xmath40 to pure imaginary time @xmath41 ( hence the termimaginary time propagation \" ) transforms the last equation to the form of the tdse @xmath42 where for simplicity we allow a slight misuse of notation @xmath43 . at this stage",
    "we insert in eq.([sh_t ] ) an ansatz identical to eq.([trial2 ] ) @xmath44,\\ ] ] and apply the zevca formulation ( section [ schro ] ) .",
    "this yields equations identical to eqs.([dxdt2 ] ) and ( [ initial ] ) with the only difference being @xmath45 .",

    "the relative error between the exact tunneling probability and the asymptotic value of @xmath61 ( see eq.([bt ] ) ) for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is roughly @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",

    "= 9.5 cm = 9.5 cm    = 9.5 cm = 9.5 cm    the zevca formulation of tunneling probabilities has a significant restriction on its use .",

    "the choice of @xmath19 must satisfy two properties : ( 1 ) the derivatives of the potential ( @xmath96 $ ] , @xmath97 ) must have at least one term that is significantly different from zero . ( 2 ) the initial wavefunction at @xmath19 ( @xmath98 $ ] ) needs to be significantly different from zero .",
    "these restrictions ensure that the initial conditions `` capture '' the wavefunction and the potential s surroundings at @xmath19 .",

    "in contrast , the zevca transformation from the schrdinger real time propagator to the imaginary time propagator is unique and the fixed characteristics are obtained for all time simply by _ choosing _ @xmath118 .",
    "as we demonstrate , the energy eigenvalues obtained using zevca are of the same accuracy as using tsm while the formulation is decidedly simpler .    for the sake of comparison , we consider two of the potentials that were studied in reference @xcite .",

    "we see a faster convergence to the exact result as a function of @xmath71 than in the quartic case .",
    "the reason is that the parameters of the morse potential correspond to a small perturbation from a harmonic oscillator potential . for the harmonic oscillator it is possible to show that the zevca approximation for @xmath84 yields the exact quantum result . for anharmonic oscillators ,",
    "the truncation at @xmath84 incorporates only @xmath142 , \\ j=0,1,2 $ ] in eqs.([dxdt2 ] ) , which is equivalent to making a harmonic approximation to the potential ( note that the results obtained for @xmath84 for both the quartic potential and the morse potential correspond to the energy eigenvalue of the harmonic approximation to the two potentials respectively ) . since the parameters of the morse potential correspond to a smaller perturbation from a harmonic oscillator potential than the parameters for the quartic potential , the convergence with @xmath71 is faster .",
    "we have presented zevca , a new approximation for quantum dynamics calculations that is a cross between a grid method and a semiclassical method .",
    "the formulation was applied to the calculation of tunneling probabilities and low energy eigenvalues , with surprisingly good accuracy .",
    "the zevca formulation has several advantages : ( 1 ) the derivation of the formulation is straightforward and the equations of motion are readily solvable by standard numerical software . ( 2 ) the zevca approximation yields the solution of the tdse at a fixed and predetermined position .",
    "this allows for easy application to quantum quantities that require only local information .",
    "( 3 ) the zevca formulation requires the calculation of the potential and its derivatives only at @xmath19 ( see eqs.([dxdt2 ] ) ) .",
    "this is in contrast to most semiclassical methods that propagate trajectories in configuration space and require the calculation of the potential ( or its derivatives ) at each time step .",
    "( 4 ) no root search is needed as in many other semiclassical methods .",
    "( 5 ) the extension to imaginary time propagation is easily attainable .",
    "( 6 ) by taking @xmath143 , zevca formally gives the exact quantum result .",
    "although we have not conducted a rigorous comparison of timings , for the applications presented here zevca was found to be several orders of magnitude faster than the exact quantum calculation using a split operator method .",
    "still , the numerical implementations reveals a number of limitations .",
    "first , the convergence to the exact result as a function of @xmath71 seems to be asymptotic , in the sense that there is an optimal choice of @xmath71 .",
    "second , the method has difficulty at nodal positions .",
    "surprisingly , this is not a result of the original ansatz ( eq.([trial2 ] ) ) but is a limitation imposed by the condition of fixed trajectories .",
    "since the trajectories are fixed , clearly they can not cross .",
    "we have demonstrated elsewhere that making the ansatz ( [ trial2 ] ) but allowing for contributions from crossing trajectories can produce interference effects such as nodes and oscillations@xcite .",
    "third , in section [ tunnel ] we have presented limitations on the relation between the position of the initial wavefunction , the derivatives of the potential and the choice of @xmath19 .",
    "these limitations originate from the need to incorporate in the initial conditions of zevca `` sufficient '' data for a successful propagation .",
    "an alternative to the procedure we have described is to discard ansatz ( [ trial2 ] ) and construct a hierarchy of odes for the wavefunction @xmath144 $ ] itself , instead of for the complex phase , @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "we have explored this direction but found that it produces very poor results . in the case of an initial gaussian wavepacket",
    "it is readily verified that the truncation for @xmath145 does not entail any approximation to the complex phase derivatives @xmath146 $ ] ( see eqs.([moment0 ] ) ) .",
    "this is not the case for the derivatives of the initial wavefunction @xmath147 $ ] itself , which go to infinity as a function of @xmath71 for every choice of @xmath19 .",
    "this observation provides additional justification for making the replacement @xmath148 in the first place .",
    "we are currently working on several extensions of the zevca formulation .",
    "specifically , we are exploiting the local properties of zevca for the calculation of thermal rates@xcite .",
    "similar to the implementations of zevca we have presented in this paper , the calculation of thermal rates requires only local information .",
    "this allows us to obtain thermal rates for one - dimensional systems using only two trajectory propagations .",
    "we aim at exploring both zevca and its close relative , bohmian mechanics with complex action , in multi - dimensional quantum systems .",
