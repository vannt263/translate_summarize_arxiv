    "condensed states of identical bosons at zero temperature in a confining external field are accessible for experiments in many laboratories @xcite",
    ". most often the condensates are formed by one species of bosons , but also two - component structures have been investigated .",

    "the spin states may then be converted from one to the other while maintaining the total number of atoms .",
    "also collective oscillations can be studied experimentally as in @xcite for @xmath1rb .",
    "two - component boson condensates of different atoms have other properties as investigated by combining @xmath1rb and @xmath2k @xcite .",
    "more recently mixtures of boson and fermion systems have been realized @xcite .",
    "the theory for two - component condensates are mostly based on the mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom lead to spatial symmetry breaking in a cylindrical trap as shown in @xcite .",
    "collective excitations in such traps are predicted @xcite . with two different trap frequencies",
    "also spherical traps allow collective excitations @xcite .",
    "the spatial asymmetry is sometimes favored even in spherical traps @xcite .",
    "repulsion between the two components can lead to separation of the two components both in the ground state and for the collective oscillations @xcite .",
    "stability conditions can be derived from properties of the collective modes @xcite .",
    "another type of formulation using hyperspherical coordinates for one - component boson systems was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this formulation was extended to include two - body correlations for one - component @xmath3-body boson systems @xcite .",
    "this treatment allowed both very large scattering lengths and attractive two - body interactions .",
    "the mathematical collapse is prevented by a finite range interaction .",
    "conditions for the physical collapse are rather similar to mean - field results .",
    "still the computed correlated structures for large scattering length may be physically interesting @xcite .",
    "the present paper follows up with more details and new calculations on a recent attempt to extend the hyperspherical formulation to two - component boson systems @xcite .",
    "although several new features appear , we still only employ the lowest - order approximation with inclusion of three collective coordinates .",
    "this is the minimum number of degrees of freedom which can describe individual sizes of the two subsystems and their separation distance . a demand for more complicated extensions may arise , but the specific direction is better decided after digestion of the results from the simplest model survey .",
    "in section [ sec2 ] we formulate the theoretical framework where the effective potential is introduced .",
    "the properties of this key quantity is investigated in details in section [ sec3 ] , especially with respect to minima and their curvatures .",
    "then we are equipped to establish stability conditions for the total system as discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "our conclusions are contained in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "finally , for completeness we include a number of rather tedious mathematical details in three appendices , but the main text can be read independently because only analytic and numerical results are used .",
    "we consider a dilute system of two species of bosons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with boson masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 and particle numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "the interaction strengths of the two - body zero - range pseudo potentials , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , are related to the @xmath0-wave scattering lengths , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "this normalization is adopted to provide the correct large - distance behavior of the effective potential in mean - field computations @xcite .",
    "we shall use hyperspherical coordinates with hyperradii defined for both the individual and the total systems @xcite , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total mass , @xmath27 is an arbitrary normalization mass , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the individual center of mass coordinates and @xmath30 is the overall center - of - mass coordinate , i.e. @xmath31 the center of mass separation of the two components is then given by the coordinate @xmath32 .",

    "can also be separated in terms related to total center of mass , relative and intrinsic @xmath4 and @xmath5 degrees of freedom , i.e. @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the usual three - dimensional derivatives with respect to the indicated coordinates , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the intrinsic kinetic - energy operators expressed by hyperspherical coordinates for each boson system , see @xcite .",
    "the two - body interactions depend only on relative distances and we can completely separate relative and total center of mass motions .",
    "furthermore , we can separate relative @xmath4 and @xmath5 except for the coupling term @xmath52 . the hamiltonian in equation ( [ eq : th ] ) then becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the usual angular momentum operator with respect to @xmath43 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 consist of first and second order derivatives with respect to the hyperangular degrees of freedom indicated by the indices .",
    "this hamiltonian reduces for @xmath57 and identical interactions , @xmath58 , to the one - component system described in @xcite .",
    "the separable center of mass motion is given by the harmonic oscillator solutions to the hamiltonian in equation ( [ e50 ] ) .",
    "the relative motion can be determined by the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method where the wave function for fixed values of @xmath59 is expanded on the complete set of eigenfunctions for @xmath60 in equation ( [ e60 ] ) .",
    "the leading term in the lowest adiabatic channel is expected to consist of the lowest partial waves , where the wave function is independent of all ( hyper)angles . this is the assumption valid in the large - distance limit where all particles are far from each other and all directional dependence is averaged out @xcite .",
    "then the wave function for the lowest eigenvalue reduces to the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 only depends on the three radial coordinates .",
    "this radial wave function and the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath63 are determined from the schrdinger equation obtained by combining equations ( [ e55 ] ) and ( [ e80 ] ) , i.e. @xmath64f(\\rho_a,\\rho_b , r )   = e_{\\rm rel}f(\\rho_a,\\rho_b , r ) \\label{e85 }   \\\\",

    "then @xmath74 is given as @xmath75 which can be considered as the energy surface depending on the three collective coordinates @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the properties of this effective potential then reflects the properties of the solutions which , if necessary , could be computed from the eigenvalue equation ( [ e85 ] ) .",
    "the expression reduces to the one - component potential @xcite when @xmath76 and all particles are identical , i.e. @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the common scattering length and @xmath79 .",
    "to be specific we consider parameters corresponding to a system where both components are @xmath1rb atoms with the mass @xmath80 kg @xcite . the bosons in both components are assumed to be trapped in the same spherical harmonic potential with the frequency @xmath81hz .",
    "the related oscillator length @xmath82 is then 2.22 @xmath83 m .",
    "the particle numbers @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the three @xmath0-wave scattering lengths @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are variable parameters .",
    "all terms in the potential ( [ eq : ueff ] ) are simple and explicitly given , except the function @xmath70 arising from the interaction @xmath52 in equation ( [ eq : intab ] ) , see appendix [ app : int ] . without this interaction",
    "the two subsystems would decouple and each behaves as a separate one - component system .",
    "we show this interaction term in figures [ fig1a ] and [ fig1b ] for several sets of particle numbers and hyperradii .",
    "the general features are a monotonous function with a flat maximum at @xmath76 and vanishing exactly for @xmath84 . for given @xmath3",
    "the symmetric combination of @xmath85 and @xmath86 leads to the highest maximum value of unity corresponding to the smallest average distance between particles in the subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the interaction between the two components is strongest for symmetric systems with coinciding centers .",
    "as the centers are moved apart , the interaction becomes larger for different values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "asymmetric division of a given total number of particles also decrease the interaction . these properties directly reflect the dependences of the overlap between the two density distributions .",
    "the two - body interaction strength @xmath24 is a proportionality factor on the function @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , attraction prefers symmetric division and coinciding centers , whereas repulsion prefers precisely opposite , i.e. asymmetry and large distance between the center of masses .",
    "we minimize the effective potential in equation ( [ eq : ueff ] ) with respect to @xmath87 and @xmath88 for fixed @xmath35 and given scattering lengths and particle numbers .",
    "we first choose interactions corresponding to the two - component condensate of two spin states of @xmath1rb .",
    "the three scattering lengths are then almost identical and given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the bohr radius @xcite .",
    "the total number of particles is rather arbitrarily fixed to be @xmath91 .",
    "the results for identical scattering lengths are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main features are that the effective potential at @xmath76 is independent of the division of particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but still strongly varying with the total number @xmath3 .",
    "this potential value at @xmath76 is the same as obtained for the one - component potential in equation ( [ e38 ] ) when @xmath36 is calculated from equation ( [ e25 ] ) with the minimum values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    for these identical repulsive scattering lengths and the symmetric divisions of @xmath92 ,",
    "the systems prefer coinciding centers of mass , i.e. the potential has a minimum for @xmath76 .",
    "as we increase the particle asymmetry , another minimum appears at @xmath93 and for @xmath94 ( or @xmath95 ) eventually becomes deeper .",
    "the minimum at @xmath76 remains , but now separated by a barrier .",
    "the deepest of these minima is found when @xmath96 .",
    "even larger asymmetries again increase the depth and eventually only the @xmath76 minimum remains as for a one - component system .",
    "maintaining @xmath97 we show in figure [ fig2 ] the variation with the scattering length @xmath98 for a symmetric division of particle numbers .",
    "the flat region around @xmath76 is always present , but the minimum for @xmath99 turns into a maximum when @xmath100 .",
    "then the repulsion between the subsystems is strong enough to move the minimum at @xmath76 to finite values corresponding to values @xmath101 . for less repulsion , @xmath102",
    ", the minimum at @xmath76 is always present and in addition another minimum at finite @xmath35 appears for sufficiently asymmetric particle divisions .",
    "the basic characteristics of a system are size and energy .",
    "the root - mean - square distance is the measure of the size of a system which in our coordinates are given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the root mean square radii for total and individual subsystems and @xmath107 represents the expectation value for the total wave function .    for identical interactions of @xmath108 we found in @xcite that @xmath109 in the minimum at @xmath76 independent of particle division .",
    "this structure closely resembles the one - component system . increasing the distance @xmath35 between the centers of the subsystems",
    "reduce all three root mean square radii .",
    "however , as @xmath110 changes , the system with the largest particle number always maintains roughly the same value of about @xmath111 .",
    "in contrast , the root mean square radius of the other subsystem decreases to about half of the value for @xmath76 .    the minima of effective potentials as in figure [ fig2 ] define the preferred structures .",
    "the effect of the repulsion is that the two systems try to avoid each other while staying at distances small compared to the size of the confining external field .",
    "the large subsystem is exploiting the space almost like it was alone in the trap .",
    "when one subsystem is small , it becomes advantageous to place about half of its particles outside the other subsystem .",
    "then the repulsion on the small subsystem from the trap and the other subsystem is minimized .    when @xmath94 , the lowest minimum occurs at finite @xmath35 .",
    "the center of mass of the small system @xmath5 remains within the radius @xmath112 until @xmath113 .",
    "for even smaller subsystems the center of @xmath5 moves a little outside @xmath105 , but still the distance between the centers at the minimum remains smaller than @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , complete separation between the systems does not occur .",
    "many of these basic properties remain for @xmath115 as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the root mean square radii again are largest for @xmath76 with values increasing as a function of @xmath24 corresponding to decreasing the overlap in order to decrease the energy .",
    "for relatively large values of @xmath35 where the subsystems essentially can avoid overlapping , the sizes become independent of @xmath24 . at intermediate distances",
    "a minimum size is always found .",
    "the smaller the repulsion @xmath24 , the less is the variation with center of mass distance .",
    "the local minima in the @xmath35-direction represent a projection in the three dimensional space .",
    "we can evaluate the stability by computing the second derivatives of the effective potential in these points .",
    "the kinetic energy operators already only contain second derivatives and the relative hamiltonian @xmath116 is then to second order approximated by @xmath117 where we used the notation of the @xmath118-matrix sandwiched between the two vectors .",
    "all first order derivatives are zero in these minima .",
    "the approximation in equation ( [ eq : qf ] ) is almost directly three separable harmonic oscillators .",
    "we first redefine the variables by scaling with the related masses as @xmath119 then all three kinetic energy operators are dimensionless and the energy unit is @xmath120 .",
    "it is now sufficient to diagonalize the potential matrix in equation ( [ eq : qf ] ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian then has eigenvalues and eigenvectors @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "the total energy is given by @xmath124 with the non - negative integers @xmath125 corresponding to one - dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "the excitation energies for each of these vibrational degrees of freedom are then integer multiples of @xmath126 .    for the minimum at @xmath76 the @xmath33-@xmath34 and the @xmath35 degrees of freedom decouple completely .",
    "this is a consequence of the flat maximum at @xmath76 for the interaction function in figures [ fig1a ] and [ fig1b ] , because first order @xmath35-derivatives of @xmath70 then vanish and the only other @xmath35-dependence is the @xmath127 arising from the external field .",
    "for this minimum the lowest vibrational @xmath35-mode carries the energy @xmath128 dictated by the boundary condition at @xmath76 corresponding to negative parity .",
    "the total energy is in this case given by @xmath129 .",
    "still the vibrational excitation energies are integer multiples of @xmath130 .",
    "the normal modes are given by the components of the eigenvectors @xmath131 defining a direction in the coordinate system @xmath132 .",
    "the physical system has natural length scales for the different degrees of freedom corresponding to the initial coordinates @xmath59 .",
    "they are exhibited by the sizes of the subsystems , i.e. the root mean square radii defined in equations ( [ e57])-([e59 ] ) .",
    "thus the proper physical length scales are @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which means that we should multiply the coefficient measuring the @xmath33-component by @xmath135 to change to the coefficient measuring the corresponding root mean square radius . the normal mode directions with these root mean square unit vectors are then represented by the vectors @xmath136 .",
    "these eigenvectors and the related eigenvalues are given in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "for the minimum at @xmath76 the @xmath35-direction is completely decoupled from the two other normal modes mixing @xmath33 and @xmath34 . by far",
    "the lowest eigenvalue corresponds to the @xmath35-mode which means vibrations of the relative center of mass .",

    "this vibration is around the equilibrium structure where the subsystems both are of equal size .    the highest - lying mode for the @xmath76 minimum corresponds to in - phase oscillations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the equal amplitudes of the real size components , @xmath149 , combined with orthogonality of @xmath150 and @xmath151 , implies that @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .    in general ,",
    "the vector @xmath154 is at the minimum position precisely in the direction of the total hyperradius defined in equation ( [ e25 ] ) . for @xmath76 the root mean square radii of the two subsystems are equal and we have from equations ( [ e57])-([e59 ] ) that @xmath155 .",

    "all three directions are mixed in the normal modes as seen in table [ tab2 ] .",

    "the second mode again corresponds almost completely to the isovector breathing mode , i.e. out - of - phase oscillation with equal real size amplitudes of the two subsystems .",
    "now an admixture of up to 30% probability in the @xmath35-direction is present .",
    "the highest - lying mode is in - phase oscillation of the two subsystems .",
    "again this mode corresponds to maximum variation of the total hyperradius and therefore the breathing mode can not be fully exploited .",

    "the highest vibrational excitation energy , @xmath157 , is consistently about @xmath158 which is the one - component result for a bose - einstein condensate in the limit of large particle numbers @xcite .",
    "this breathing mode is energetically less favored than the isovector breathing mode , where one subsystem oscillates against the other and the repulsive interaction minimizes the overlap . in both these modes",
    "all three repulsions contribute .",
    "the stability is first of all determined by the existence of minima . however , for many - body atomic systems lower lying minima certainly exist with structures completely different from condensed states .",
    "these metastable states are confined by barriers providing a finite lifetime . in three - dimensional quantum mechanics",
    "the minimum in the potential energy may be too shallow or narrow to allow the zero point oscillations .",
    "crude estimates of stability are then first obtained by locating extremum points with positive curvature in the potential .",
    "second by comparing the vibrational energies with the barrier heights .",
    "let us first assume identical scattering lengths where two minima in the @xmath35-direction appears for some divisions of particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the values of the effective potential at these two minima for @xmath76 and @xmath156 are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the first prominent feature is that only the @xmath76-minimum exists for @xmath159 . for more asymmetric divisions , @xmath160 ,",
    "the minimum at finite @xmath35 quickly becomes substantially deeper .",
    "the zero point energies are added to the potential , but the sum coincides with the potential within the thickness of the lines in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "both oscillations are essentially always classically allowed , i.e. around finite @xmath35 very quickly after it appeared and around @xmath76 until the asymmetry reaches very small values .    the highest minimum located at @xmath76 could in principle decay into the lowest minimum at finite @xmath35 .",
    "the related lifetime can be estimated by the wkb tunneling approximation where the decay rate @xmath161 is given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the turning points and @xmath165 is the oscillation frequency in the @xmath35-direction .",

    "the largest system maintains the same size @xmath168 independent of particle number .",
    "the size of the smallest system decreases with increasing asymmetry . in all cases we find that @xmath169 , i.e. complete separation between systems never occurs . furthermore , @xmath170 when @xmath171 , i.e. the center of mass of the small system remains within the radius of the large system except for very asymmetric particle divisions .",
    "the stability of the @xmath35-mode changes with the three interactions . for @xmath76",
    "the condition for instability against separation of the two center of masses is a negative curvature in the minimum of the effective potential in the @xmath35-direction .",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath172 , @xmath85 and @xmath173 and define the coordinate at the potential minimum by @xmath174 .",
    "this minimum point is determined as the zero point of the first derivative , i.e. @xmath175 , which is equivalent to @xmath176 = 0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with precisely one solution @xmath177 when @xmath178 .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath179 is positive for @xmath180 .    a negative curvature , @xmath181 , is then equivalent to @xmath182 the instability condition , @xmath183 , is equivalent to the inequality @xmath184 , which in turn is equivalent to the two simultaneous conditions @xmath185    when @xmath186 the critical repulsion derived from equation ( [ e165 ] ) corresponds to @xmath187 . for finite values of @xmath97",
    "the critical value of @xmath24 has to be correspondingly increased .",
    "the behavior of the effective potential is illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] for parameter combinations close the critical values for separation of the two centers of mass .",
    "the potentials are rather flat and the minimum therefore quickly moves to separation distances comparable to the trap length .",
    "qualitative understanding can be reached by analytic investigations for symmetric systems , i.e. @xmath85 , @xmath188 with the constraint @xmath76 .",
    "then the condition that the effective potential at @xmath76 has no stationary point , @xmath189 for any coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 , can be expressed as @xmath190 then the two - component system is unstable since collapse to a point is unavoidable .",
    "stability requires , beside a stationary point , also that the curvature is positive in all directions .",
    "then the eigenvalues of the curvature matrix must all be positive at the stationary point .",
    "for @xmath76 we then construct and diagonalize the matrix @xmath191 for @xmath86 we can compute the eigenvalues analytically and find the conditions expressing when at least one of them is negative and the point therefore unstable . in [ app : int2 ] we derive these conditions , i.e. the system is unstable when the following two inequalities both are satisfied @xmath192 the last inequality , the stability condition for the @xmath4-component alone , can be obtained both in the mean - field approximation and with hyperspherical coordinates @xcite . furthermore , equation ( [ e173 ] ) is obtained from equation ( [ eq : stable - rho ] ) for non - interacting subsystems , where @xmath193 . both equations ( [ eq : stationary ] ) and ( [ eq : stable - rho ] ) can be derived in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "these conditions are most easily visualized by two - dimensional contour diagrams of the effective potential as function of @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath76 .",
    "such a diagram is shown in figure [ fig9 ] for interactions very close to the critical values given in equations ( [ eq : stable - rho ] ) and ( [ e173 ] ) .",
    "the potential increases when either @xmath33 or @xmath34 individually become large .",
    "this effect of the external field is especially clearly seen along the line @xmath194 , where the potential decreases from large values at very large distances , proceeds through a minimum located at around @xmath195 to reach a maxium at about @xmath196 , and finally decreases to @xmath197 at the origin . however , the minimum along this line is in fact a saddle point and therefore unstable as soon as both degrees of freedom are included . from the saddle point",
    "the energy decreases in the `` isovector '' direction where the sum of @xmath33 and @xmath34 remains constant .",
    "this saddle point changes into a stable minimum with slightly larger repulsion between the two subsystems as illustrated in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the same qualitative behavior is seen along the @xmath194 line , where the minimum and maximum are shifted to positions further apart at about @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "also the regions at relatively large distances along the coordinate axes are essentially unchanged . in the `` isovector '' direction , as well as in all other directions ,",
    "the potential now increases as characteristic for a minimum .",
    "however , the minimum is very shallow and only a small amount of energy would destabilize the system .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss the stability for different interactions .",
    "we consider again equal particle division while independently varying the scattering lengths @xmath200 and @xmath24 .",
    "the numerically computed stability diagram is shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "we shall discuss the different regions in this contour plot in comparison with the analytic derivation .",
    "first , we consider two attractive subsystems , @xmath201 , where the coinciding centers are preferred .",
    "the computed stability condition then follows the expression in equation ( [ eq : stationary ] ) , which for @xmath202 reduces to the one - component stability condition .",
    "thus , the attraction between @xmath4 and @xmath5 reduces the stability region .",
    "it is amusing that @xmath203 leads to the apparently identical stability condition of @xmath204 .",
    "however , since @xmath205 now the total number of pair interactings is twice as large , i.e. @xmath206 compared to @xmath207 .    for relatively small repulsion , @xmath208",
    ", the stability follows the expression in equation ( [ eq : stable - rho ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a local , but unstable minimum at @xmath76 , since equation ( [ e173 ] ) then also is obeyed .",
    "these conditions are related to structures of coinciding centers and therefore they are the same as derived from the mean - field approximation @xcite .    for larger repulsion , @xmath209 , separate center of masses of the two systems",
    "are energetically favored .",
    "the condition for separation is given in equation ( [ e165 ] ) which follows the computed stability curve in the interval @xmath210 .",
    "the substantial reduction of the region of mean - field stable solutions is then defined by the difference between the curves described by equations ( [ e165 ] ) and ( [ eq : stable - rho ] ) .    for larger repulsion",
    "@xmath211 the stable region is larger than found from equation ( [ e165 ] ) , because the structure at finite @xmath35 is stable for relatively strong repulsion between the subsystems .",
    "this repulsion has the effect of squeezing each of the subsystems more than if they had been left alone as described by equation ( [ eq : stationary ] ) .",
    "then the stable region in figure [ fig6 ] is in fact smaller than for non - interacting subsystems , because the barrier preventing collapse now is circumvented by the energetically favored smaller sizes and the finite @xmath35 .",
    "each subsystem therefore finds itself with values of @xmath212 and @xmath213 on the unstable side of the barrier preventing collapse if each were left alone .",
    "the mutual repulsion destabilizes the total system compared to separate subsystems .",
    "we use hyperspherical coordinates to describe a mixture of two different components each consisting of identical bosons . sufficiently dilute and spatially",
    "extended systems can be rather well approximated by use of only @xmath0-waves for all relative angular momenta . from far apart",
    "only the monopole part of the interactions is important and this is reflected in the wave function .",
    "we are then left with a wave function only depending on the most important coordinates , i.e. the hyperradius for each subsystem and the distance between the two center of masses .    with a wave function depending on these three collective coordinates and three - dimensional @xmath214-functions as the two - body interactions",
    "we derive the corresponding schrdinger equation and compute the effective potential .",
    "the behavior of this potential and the external field as a function of the three collective coordinates are decisive for the properties of the two - component system .",
    "several features are similar to results from the mean - field approximation .",
    "we used the simplest non - trivial assumptions and leave lots of room for improvements . especially two - body correlations could be included in the wave function and finite range two - body interactions with the correct behavior could be employed .",
    "when the interaction between particles in the two subsystems is attractive , the potential has a minimum for coinciding centers of mass .",
    "then the stable structures are quite similar to those obtained with the mean - field approximation . when the repulsion is sufficiently strong , new stable structures arise with finite distance between the centers .",
    "asymmetric particle numbers in the subsystems favor these structures . for moderate repulsion",
    "two stable structures are simultaneously present for centers coinciding and at a finite distance .",
    "new vibrational modes appear .",
    "the three normal modes essentially correspond to relative center of mass motion with the lowest energy , isovector and isoscalar motion with out - of - phase and in - phase oscillations of the two subsystems as the second and third mode , respectively .",
    "only the highest - lying isoscalar vibration is present in one - component systems , where the excitation energy of @xmath215 times the energy quantum of the harmonic trap almost precisely is found in our computations .",
    "new stability conditions are established .",
    "the relative center of mass degree of freedom provides both more stable structures and reduced stability compared to mean - field calculations .",
    "even when the independent subsystems are marginally stable , a comparably strong repulsion between the subsystems destabilizes the total system .    in conclusion ,",
    "new features arise for two - component systems , i.e. different stable structures , excitation modes , and stability conditions .",
    "we want to compute the expectation value of the interaction @xmath52 in equation ( [ e7 ] ) over all angles , i.e. all coordinates except @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that the constant angular wave function @xmath67 is normalized in the corresponding space , i.e. @xmath216 , where @xmath217 with the notation from equation ( [ e30 ] ) precisely defined in @xcite .",
    "the boson symmetry implies that this expectation value is @xmath218 where the position vectors can be expressed by center of mass coordinates and jacobi vectors @xmath219 , i.e. @xmath220 with @xmath221 , we need the @xmath214-function in spherical coordinates , i.e. @xmath222 where @xmath223 are legendre polynomials , @xmath224 is the angle between @xmath225 and @xmath43 , and @xmath226 .",
