    "a primary effect of a magnetic field on a type ii superconductor is to shift the specific heat peak to a lower temperature . indeed , this shift provided some of the earliest evidence for type ii superconductivity@xcite . in a mean - field treatment",
    "this behavior can be comprehended as follows : to retain the continuous character of the zero field transition the ginzburg - landau correlation length @xmath11 is supposed to diverge along the so called upper critical line of continuous phase transitions defined by @xmath12 calculations of the specific heat within the framework of the abrikosov theory and its generalizations@xcite yield at this mixed state to normal state phase boundary for the jump in the specific heat coefficient the expression @xmath13 , where the factor of proportionality is of order unity and takes the effect of the vortex lattice into account . matching with the zero field jump",
    "then requires that @xmath14 thus , the magnetic field reduces both , the transition temperature and the jump in the specific heat .",
    "although this mean - field scenario describes the experimental data of various type ii superconductors with comparatively large correlation length amplitude @xmath15 , including  mgb@xmath6@xcite , 2h - nbse@xmath6@xcite , and nb@xmath16zr@xmath10@xcite , reasonably well , it neglects an essential effect of an applied magnetic field .",
    "in analogy to liquid @xmath17he in a uniformly rotating container@xcite , the magnetic field applied to a type ii superconductor is an external perturbation which drives the system away from criticality .",
    "close to the transition temperature @xmath0 the correlation length @xmath1 increases strongly when @xmath0 is approached .",
    "however , for nonzero rotation frequency @xmath18 or magnetic field @xmath2 the average distance between vortex lines , @xmath19  or @xmath20 is a limiting length scale .",
    "for this reason @xmath1 can not grow beyond @xmath21 . consequently , for finite @xmath18 or @xmath2 , the thermodynamic quantities like the specific heat are smooth functions of temperature .",
    "as a remnant of the singularities along @xmath22 the quantities exhibit a maximum or an inflection point along @xmath23 .",
    "such a finite size effect also occurs in zero magnetic field due to inhomogeneities with length scale @xmath24 .    in this context",
    "it is instructive to refer to the early literature focused on fluctuation effects in type ii superconductors .",
    "implicit in most of these treatments is the assumption that fluctuations do not interact ; that is , only gaussian fluctuations are considered@xcite .",
    "although this assumption breaks down in the critical region , it captures some of the qualitative aspects of fluctuations in zero magnetic field .",
    "if the gaussian approximation is used to calculate thermodynamic properties of a type ii superconductor near the mean - field phase boundary @xmath25 , singular behavior of thermodynamic and transport properties is predicted to occur@xcite .",
    "however , the fluctuations of a bulk superconductor in a magnetic field become effectively one dimensional , as noted by lee and shenoy @xcite ; and a bulk superconductor behaves like an array of rods parallel to the magnetic field with diameter @xmath5 . since fluctuations become more important with reduced dimensionality and",
    "there is a limiting magnetic length scale @xmath5 it becomes clear that the critical line @xmath25 is an artefact of the approximations .",
    "indeed , calculations of the specific heat in a magnetic field which treat the interaction terms in the hartree approximation and extensions thereof , find that the specific heat is smooth through the mean - field transition temperature @xmath25@xcite . in the context of finite size scaling this is simply due to the fact that the correlation length of fluctuations which are transverse to the applied magnetic field are bounded by the magnetic length @xmath26 .",
    "a main point of this paper is to show that in a type ii superconductor the correlation length can not grow beyond the magnetic length scale @xmath27 where @xmath4 is a universal amplitude when critical fluctuations dominate .",
    "hence , the correlation length @xmath28 is bounded by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the critical exponent of the correlation length . beyond the mean - field approximation it differs from @xmath31 . due to this finite size effect",
    "the maximum of the specific heat peak is shifted to a lower temperature @xmath32 given by @xmath33 although this finite size scaling result agrees formally with the mean - field expression for @xmath34 ( eq.([eq1 ] ) ) with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 is not a line of continuous phase transitions . along this line",
    "the specific heat peak adopts its maximum value and the correlation length attains the limiting length scale @xmath5 . on the other hand , there are sample inhomogeneities with length scale @xmath24 , as well .",
    "they imply that the correlation length @xmath38 can not grow beyond @xmath24 , @xmath39 thus , the zero - field specific heat singularity is rounded . replacing in eq.([eq7 ] ) @xmath5 by @xmath24 , it is seen that the maximum of the zero field specific heat shifts to the lower temperature @xmath40 .",
    "however , in contrast to the magnetic counterpart , where the length scale @xmath41 can be varied at will in terms of the magnetic field strength , the length scale of the inhomogeneities remains fixed . in type ii superconductors where inhomogeneities are unavoidable , two limiting regimes , characterized by @xmath42 can be distinguished . for @xmath43",
    "the magnetic field induced finite size effect limits @xmath1 to grow beyond @xmath5 , while for @xmath44 it is the length scale of the inhomogeneities . since @xmath5 can be tuned by the strength of the applied magnetic field ( eq.([eq5 ] ) ) , both limits are experimentally accessible .",
    "@xmath43 is satisfied for sufficiently high and @xmath44 for low magnetic fields .",
    "thus , the occurrence of a magnetic field induced finite size effect requires that the magnetic field and the length scale of inhomogeneities affecting thermodynamic properties satisfy the lower bounds @xmath45 it is important to recognize that these bounds hold , whenever fluctuations are at work . noting that thermodynamic and transport measurements are usually performed up to @xmath46 t , it becomes clear that the magnetic field induced finite size effect allows to trace fluctuations , to extract critical properties of the homogeneous system and to derive a lower bound for the length scale of inhomogeneities which affect the thermodynamic properties of type ii superconductors .",
    "such an analysis may also help to distinguish between possible mechanisms where the length scale of the inhomogeneities enters in an essential way .",
    "below , we give a summary of the main results of this paper . a related analysis of expansivity measurements on yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath47 exposed to a magnetic field",
    "was recently performed by lortz@xcite , in terms of a comparison with a model for uniformly rotating @xmath17he@xcite .",
    "we show that in isotropic extreme type ii superconductors and nonzero magnetic field @xmath2 the correlation length can not grow beyond the limiting length scale @xmath48 , where @xmath4 is a universal amplitude .",
    "since @xmath4 turns out to be of order one , @xmath5 is comparable to the average distance between vortex lines .",
    "given this limiting length scale , we derive the scaling expression for the line @xmath49 , along which the correlation length attains the limiting magnetic length scale @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that close to zero field criticality the ratio between @xmath23 and the melting line @xmath50 is a universal number .",
    "these results , extended to anisotropic type ii superconductors are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results of schilling _",
    "et al_.@xcite and roulin _",
    "et al_.@xcite for yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath47 .",
    "moreover , we find that the data of roulin _ et al_.@xcite for the temperature and magnetic field dependent specific heat coefficient , properly rescaled , falls on a single universal curve , which is the finite size scaling function .",
    "the phase diagram which emerges consists of the lines @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the @xmath54-th component of the applied magnetic field @xmath55 .",
    "our analysis of the data for the optimally doped sample@xcite provides consistent evidence for critical properties falling into 3d - xy universality class@xcite , while the data of the underdoped sample@xcite uncovers the characteristics of a 3d-2d crossover@xcite .",
    "although the mean - field scenario describes the experimental data of various type ii superconductors with comparatively large correlation length amplitudes , including  mgb@xmath6@xcite , 2h - nbse@xmath6@xcite and nb@xmath16zr@xmath10@xcite , remarkably well , we find that this treatment underestimates the relevance of fluctuations . indeed the experimental data for the specific heat coefficient",
    "is fully consistent with a magnetic field induced finite size effect , although the critical regime is not attained .",
    "as a by - product we deduce for the length scale of the inhomogeneities affecting the thermodynamic properties of yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath47 , mgb@xmath6 , 2h - nbse@xmath6 and nb@xmath16zr@xmath10 lower bounds ranging from @xmath56 a to @xmath57 a. surprisingly enough , @xmath57 a applies to the cubic superconducting alloy nb@xmath16zr@xmath10 . since the available data does not extend to very low fields larger values are conceivable . in any case , these lower bounds are consistent with the estimates obtained from a finite size scaling analysis of  the zero field specific heat data of nearly optimally doped yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath47 single crystals , giving length scales ranging from 290 to 419 a @xcite .",
    "this raises serious doubts on the relevance of the nanoscale spatial variations in the electronic characteristics observed in underdoped bi-2212 with scanning tunnelling microscopy@xcite .",
    "as stm is a surface probe , it appears to be that these nanoscale inhomogeneities represent a surface property .",
    "furthermore , in spite of the consensus that in type ii superconductors in an applied magnetic field a phase transition to a state of zero resistance should occur , we show that the magnetic finite size effect points to the opposite conclusion .",
    "this is in agreement with the work reported in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we present a short sketch of the finite size scaling theory@xcite and show that in isotropic extreme type ii superconductors and nonzero magnetic field @xmath2 the correlation length can not grow beyond the limiting length scale @xmath58 , where @xmath4 is a universal constant . since @xmath4 turns out to be of order one , @xmath5 is comparable to the average distance between vortex lines . given this magnetic field induced limiting length scale , we derive the scaling expression for the line @xmath49 , along which the correlation length attains the limiting magnetic length scale @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that close to zero field criticality the ratio between @xmath23 and the melting line @xmath50 is a universal number .",
    "these results are then extended to anisotropic type ii superconductors .",
    "moreover , we find that the data for temperature and magnetic field dependent specific heat coefficient , properly rescaled , should fall on a single universal curve , which corresponds to the finite size scaling function .",
    "in sec.iii we analyze experimental data for the temperature dependence of the specific heat coefficient in various magnetic fields in terms of the inhomogeneity and magnetic field induced finite size effects .",
    "we concentrate on under- and optimally doped yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath47 , where single crystal data for fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the ab - plane are available @xcite and extend to the critical regime .",
    "accordingly , the full potential of the magnetic field induced finite size effect can be explored .",
    "the analysis of the data for the optimally doped sample provides consistent evidence for critical properties falling into 3d - xy universality class , while the data of the underdoped sample uncovers the characteristics of a 3d-2d crossover@xcite .",
    "although the mean - field scenario describes the experimental data of various type ii superconductors with comparatively large correlation length amplitudes , including  mgb@xmath6@xcite , 2h - nbse@xmath6@xcite and nb@xmath16zr@xmath10@xcite , remarkably well , we find that this treatment underestimates the relevance of fluctuations . indeed , the experimental data for the specific heat coefficient is fully consistent with a magnetic field induced finite size effect , although the critical regime is not attained . as a by - product we obtain for the length scale of the inhomogeneities affecting the thermodynamic properties of  yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath47 , mgb@xmath6 , 2h - nbse@xmath6 and nb@xmath16zr@xmath10 lower bounds ranging from @xmath56 a to @xmath57 a. surprisingly enough , @xmath57 a applies to the cubic superconducting alloy nb@xmath16zr@xmath10 . since the available data does not extend to very low fields larger values are conceivable",
    "this raises serious doubts on the relevance of the nanoscale spatial variations in the electronic characteristics observed in underdoped bi-2212 with scanning tunnelling microscopy@xcite .",
    "although we concentrate on the specific heat , it is shown that the magnetic field induced finite size effect also affects the other thermodynamic and the transport properties , including the magnetoconductivity .",
    "the finite size scaling theory is based on the assumption that the system feels its finite size when the correlation length becomes of the order of the confining length @xmath24 . for a physical quantity @xmath59",
    "this statement can be expressed as@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 @xmath24 denotes the relevant confining length , @xmath0 the transition temperature and @xmath62 the correlation length of the bulk system .",
    "thus , the correlation length , @xmath63 , with critical amplitude @xmath64 , critical exponent @xmath30 , where @xmath65 , can not grow beyond @xmath24 as @xmath66 .",
    "thus at @xmath67 , where @xmath68 there is no singularity and the transition is rounded . due to this finite size effect",
    "the maximum of the specific heat peak occurs at a temperature @xmath32 shifted by @xmath69 given the singular behavior of the specific heat coefficient of the perfect system @xmath70 the magnitude of the peak located at @xmath32 scales then as @xmath71 here we used the universal relation@xcite @xmath72 between the critical amplitudes of the specific heat coefficient @xmath73 , correlation length and correlation volume @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 is the critical exponent of the specific heat singularity and @xmath76 are universal numbers .",
    "since superconductors fall in the experimentally accessible critical regime into the 3d - xy universality class , with known critical exponents and critical amplitude combinations , we take the universal properties , including@xcite @xmath77 for granted . in superconductors",
    "the order parameter is a complex scalar for which one has to define below @xmath0 the transverse correlation length @xmath78 .",
    "it is proportional to the helicity modulus , related to the london penetration depth via@xcite @xmath79    since real systems are not only inhomogeneous but are almost always impure , it is important to clarify whether or not quenched disorder affects the critical behavior . in general , the critical behavior of disordered systems is complicated , but there is a criterion , due to harris @xcite .",
    "it states that the critical behavior of disordered systems does not differ from that of the pure system when @xmath80 .",
    "this is the case when the critical exponent @xmath75 of the specific heat is negative .    rewriting eq.([eq17 ] ) in the form @xmath81 we realize that the @xmath24 dependence of the specific heat coefficient at @xmath82 allows to determine critical amplitude and exponent combinations . a useful generalization of this relation is obtained from eqs.([eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) , namely@xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the finite size scaling function of its argument . in the limit @xmath85 and at small but fixed values of @xmath86 , @xmath87 . when we leave @xmath24 fixed and consider the limit @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath89 , while at @xmath32 , where @xmath90 , eq.([eq17 ] ) requires that @xmath91 .",
    "this scaling form allows to determine how far the specific heat of a system with restricted extent can be described in terms of a universal scaling function .",
    "the study of finite size effects in the @xmath92-transition of @xmath17he , as the bulk is confined more and more tightly in one or more dimensions@xcite , as well as computer simulations of model systems @xcite , have been a very good ground for testing such finite size scaling predictions . in this context",
    "it is essential to recognize that a finite size scaling analysis allows to assess the importance of critical fluctuations and to extract universal critical point properties of the homogeneous system .",
    "moreover , a systematic analysis also allows to determine the length scale and even the shape of the inhomogeneities@xcite .    in type ii superconductors and nonzero magnetic field @xmath2",
    "there is an additional limiting length scale . to derive this magnetic length scale we note that the free energy density of an anisotropic type ii superconductor adopts below but close to the zero field transition temperature  @xmath0 the scaling form@xcite @xmath93 @xmath94 is the transverse correlation length along direction @xmath54 , diverging in zero field as @xmath95",
    ", @xmath96 is a universal number @xcite and @xmath97 a universal scaling function of its argument .",
    "furthermore , @xmath65 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the applied magnetic field . in zero field",
    "( i.e. @xmath100 ) one recovers for @xmath101 the scaling expression of the 3d xy universality class@xcite , leading to the universal relation ( [ eq18 ] ) . in the isotropic case ( @xmath102 ) this scaling form",
    "was confirmed by perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "this scaling should give an adequate description of the physics of extreme type ii single crystal superconductors in an intermediate critical regime , where gauge fluctuations are suppressed , leaving a quenched vector potential .",
    "in establishing the limiting magnetic length scale we consider the isotropic case , to simplify the notation . in analogy to uniformly rotating superfluid @xmath17he",
    "it does not depend on temperature@xcite .",

    "there are also inhomogeneities of length scale @xmath24 . as aforementioned , two limiting regimes characterized by @xmath125 ( eq.([eq10 ] ) ) can be distinguished . for @xmath43",
    "the magnetic field induced finite size effect sets the limiting length scale , because @xmath118 is bounded by @xmath5 , while for @xmath44 , @xmath118 is limited by @xmath24 , the length scale of the inhomogeneities . since @xmath58 ( eq.([eq24a ] ) ) , both limits are experimentally accessible .",
    "@xmath43 requires sufficiently large and @xmath44 small magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of a magnetic field induced finite size effect requires that the magnetic field strength exceeds the lower bound @xmath126(eq.([eq11 ] ) ) . on the contrary its absence up to the field @xmath2 provides a lower bound for the length scale of the inhomogeneities @xmath127 ( eq.([eq24a ] ) ) .    supposing that @xmath43 is satisfied , the singularity in the specific heat is replaced by a broad peak reaching its maximum value at @xmath128 which decreases with increasing field strength . from eq.([eq15 ] ) we obtain for the shift and with eq.([eq17 ] ) for the height of the peak in the specific heat coefficient the expressions @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively .",
    "we note that for @xmath80 ( eq.([eq19 ] ) ) the peak height decreases monotonically even for small fields . since for fixed magnetic field strength @xmath2 , @xmath131 , while @xmath132 , it becomes clear that the critical regime considered here can be attained in superconductors with sufficiently small correlation length amplitude only .",
    "here@xmath133 can be tuned into the experimentally accessible range by increasing the magnetic field , while @xmath134 is controlled by the small inverse correlation volume .    since the transverse correlation lengths which are parallel to the applied field are limited by the length scale @xmath5 , eq.([eq29 ] )",
    "is readily extended to the anisotropic case for magnetic fields applied parallel to the a , b or c - axis : @xmath135 where @xmath136 the specific heat coefficient at @xmath32 adopts then the form given by eq.([eq7 ] ) with the correlation volume appropriate for the anisotropic case .",

    "there is a discontinuity in the internal energy associated with coexistence of the abrikosov lattice and the vortex liquid .",
    "this in turn gives rise to a @xmath150-function peak in the specific heat@xcite and to a singularity in the scaling function @xmath97 of the free energy density ( eq.([eq22 ] ) ) at some universal value @xmath151 of its argument . according to eq.([eq22 ] ) the melting line @xmath152 is then fixed by    @xmath153    on the other hand there is the @xmath51 , where @xmath154 attains the limiting magnetic length scale @xmath155 . using eqs.([eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq33 ] ) we find @xmath156 and the ratio @xmath157 turns out to be universal . because a limiting length scale , like @xmath5 @xmath158 , also leads to a rounding of first - order transitions@xcite , the vortex melting transition is expected to broaden with increasing magnetic field .",
