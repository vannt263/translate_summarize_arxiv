    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies is shaped by the aftermath of recent , massive star formation ( sf ) .",
    "huge cavities filled with coronal gas are believed to be blown in the ambient medium through strong stellar winds of the most massive stars as well as through subsequent type ii supernova ( sn ) explosions of stars more massive than @xmath118  m@xmath12 ( see tenorio ",
    "tagle & bodenheimer 1988 for a review ) .",
    "the structures that form during such processes are often referred to as bubbles ( diameter @xmath1310  pc ) , superbubbles ( @xmath13200  pc ) or supergiant shells ( @xmath131  kpc ) .",
    "a recent development is the finding that supergiant shells reach much larger sizes in dwarf galaxies than in more massive spiral galaxies ( puche _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , walter &  brinks 1998  hereafter referred to as wb98 ) .",
    "this is attributed to dwarfs having a lower gravitational potential , which allows shells to grow more easily , and to the absence of differential rotation and spiral density waves , which prevents them from being destroyed prematurely .",
    "dwarf galaxies are therefore ideally suited to study the origin and evolution of supergiant shells .    cox & smith ( 1974 ) not only realized that the energy input of sne creates cavities filled with hot gas , but that the cooling time is relatively long ( @xmath14 to @xmath15 years , depending on density and temperature of the matter within ) , allowing the creation of a tunneling network ( the swiss cheese model ) .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1977 ) discussed a model in which fast stellar winds are adiabatically shocked to temperatures of order @xmath14@xmath16  k. these winds then act like a piston , driving the expansion of the outer shell of swept - up ambient material .",
    "the basic picture still stands today , although several refinements have been proposed , e.g. , by chu & mac  low ( 1990 ) who calculate the expected x ",
    "ray emission from superbubbles .",
    "the ism that is swept up accumulates in the form of an expanding shell and forms the rim of a superbubble or supergiant shell .",
    "the resulting shocks on their rims may induce new generations of sf , or sf regions may be created simply via gravitational fragmentation ( elmegreen 1994 , for an early discussion see mueller & arnett 1976 ) .",
    "direct observational evidence for the theoretical scenarios mentioned above is still scarce .",
    "very few , if any , supergiant shells have been detected to date through the emission of the coronal gas ( see bomans _",
    "et al .  _",
    "1996 for a review ) .",
    "in fact , it is the neutral and ionized gas which has proven to be the best tool to trace the outlines of superbubbles .",
    "the best direct evidence has come from rosat pspc observations , giving information about the plasma properties of the interior of some superbubbles .",
    "examples are the supergiant shell lmc4 ( bomans , dennerl & krster 1994 ) , the superbubbles n44 ( kim _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and n11 ( mac  low _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , all three situated in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the supergiant shell sgs2 in ngc4449 ( bomans , chu & hopp 1997 ) and the possible supershell near holmbergix ( miller 1995 ) . in the following",
    "we will present the probable detection of coronal gas filling a supergiant shell within the nearby ( 3.2  mpc ) dwarf galaxy ic2574 .",
    "the neutral interstellar medium of ic2574 has been extensively studied by wb98 using observations obtained with the nrao very large array .",
    "an surface brightness map of ic2574 is shown in fig .",
    "wb98 find a total of 48 holes in ic2574 most of which are expanding .",
    "the most prominent of these holes ( no .  35 in their study ) is the subject of this letter .",
    "an map of the region around this hole is shown as a blowup in fig .",
    "the size of the hole is @xmath111000  pc @xmath17 500  pc ( which corresponds to an effective radius @xmath18  pc ) and its radial expansion velocity is @xmath1125  @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamical age is therefore about @xmath19 years . wb98",
    "show that the 1@xmath20scale height of the disk is approximately 350  pc , or of the same order as the radius of the hole .",
    "hence , the hole is still contained within the disk ( no material lost due to blow  out of the gas into the halo ) . given the derived scaleheight and ambient average column density of @xmath21 , the ambient volume density before the creation of the hole",
    "is estimated at @xmath22 .",
    "the mass that was present before the evacuation of the hole which now must be largely accumulated on the rim is therefore about @xmath23  m@xmath24 . using these numbers and correcting the mass for the contribution of primordial helium , we estimate the kinetic energy of the expanding shell to be @xmath25  ergs .",
    "no signature of an infalling high  velocity cloud ( hvc ) is found in the data and wb98 propose an internal origin for the creation of the hole . using the numerical models of chevalier ( 1974 ) , who calulates the late phase of supernova remnants in which the shell accretes matter from both the interstellar medium and the hot interior , an energy input of @xmath26  ergs by a star forming region is needed to create this hole .",
    "note that the kinetic energy of the hole is of order 10% of this value , which is about half the value originally predicted by weaver _",
    "et al .  _",
    "this energy is equivalent to about 100 type ii sne and the strong stellar winds of their progenitors ; a major sf event .      in order to trace regions of current sf activity ,",
    "h@xmath4 maps were obtained by wb98 . a greyscale representation of their h@xmath4 map is given in fig .",
    "although the global sf activity in ic2574 is rather low , a ring of regions is prominent in the northeast quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "a blowup of the h@xmath4 emission around the same region as in fig .",
    "2a is given in fig .",
    "note that virtually all h@xmath4 emission in that region is situated on the rim of the shell ( as first noticed by martimbeau , carignan & roy 1994 ) .",
    "three wolf  rayet stars have been detected in the most luminous region on the northern rim by drissen , roy & moffat ( 1993 ) .",
    "iue spectra through the same region show the presence of p  cygni profiles indicating the presence of strong stellar winds ( rosa , joubert & benvenuti 1984 ) .",
    "using the calibration by miller & hodge ( 1994 ) , the total h@xmath4 flux on the rim is @xmath27  erg  @xmath28s@xmath7 which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath29 l@xmath24 ( l@xmath30  erg  s@xmath7 ) or an energy equivalent of about 50 stars of spectral type o5 ( wb98 ) .",
    "this is almost one third of the h@xmath4 luminosity of 30  dor , which is believed to be the most active sf region in the local group ( chu & kennicutt 1994 ) .",
    "the average volume densities derived on the rim of the shell are 3  @xmath9 for the neutral ( southern part ) and 2  @xmath9 for the ionized hydrogen in the northern part .",
    "this suggests that most of the neutral gas component in the northern part of the hole has been ionized by the prominent sf regions .",
    "radio continuum maps of ic2574 were obtained at @xmath316 cm using the vla d  array . a map of the @xmath316cm emission is presented in fig .",
    "we detect four radio sources in the region of the supergiant shell ; their positions and flux densitities ( in parentheses ) are b102459.7 + 684320 ( s=0.9mjy ) , b102503.1 + 684348 ( s=1.1mjy ) , b102507.5 + 684325 ( s=0.8mjy ) and b102507.7 + 684346 ( s=0.8mjy ) .",
    "the flux densities are accurate to within 20% .",
    "three of the four sources coincide with regions of intense h@xmath4 emission on the rim of the shell .",
    "these sources have radio / h@xmath4 flux ratios that are consistent with the radio emission being purely thermal ( caplan & deharveng 1986 ) .",
    "this result confirms that the h@xmath4 emission traces photo  ionized gas and that these sources are indeed regions and not shock  ionized regions due to the expansion of the hole .",
    "the source furthest to the southwest , b102459.7 + 684320 , is clearly nonthermal ( see fig .",
    "2d ) and its radio emission is well in excess of what one would expect from an region on the basis of the rather weak h@xmath4 emission .",
    "it most likely is a supernova remnant given its nonthermal nature , its appearance as a point source and a flux density which is consistent with the brighter snrs found in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , duric _ et al .  _ 1995 ; lacey _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "in order to examine the x  ray properties of ic2574 , we have analysed a rosat pspc observation towards ic2574 ( us600145p , total integration time : 7.3ks ) .",
    "the pspc point spread function at @xmath32kev is about @xmath33 ( fwhm ) across the area of interest .",
    "the pointed rosat pspc observation reveals a significant x ",
    "ray feature which is coincident with the very center of the hole .",
    "a contour map of the x  ray emission is overlaid on the h@xmath4emission in figs .",
    "1b ( whole galaxy ) and 2b ( blowup ) .",
    "an overlay with the is presented in fig .  2c .",
    "this x  ray feature has an angular extent of about @xmath34 ( fwhm ) , with its major axis aligned with the hole .",
    "note that the emission is extended even if we account for the residual pointing uncertainties of the rosat telescope of about @xmath35 ( hasinger 1997 , priv .",
    "in addition , rosat s wobble direction during the observations was perpendicular to the orientation of the major axis of the hole . based on the rosat pspc observations we therefore find evidence for extended x  ray emission originating from the interior of the hole",
    ". however higher resolution observations will be needed to confirm this .",
    "ic2574 is located at a high galactic latitude ( @xmath36 ) , which means that the photoelectric absorption due to the galactic interstellar medium is moderate .",
    "the leiden / dwingeloo @xmath521-cm line survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) gives an column density of @xmath37 after separating the galactic diffuse emission from that of ic2574 . because of the apparently clear line of sight through the hole ( see fig .",
    "1a ) we considered it justified to neglect any contribution to the column density within ic2574 .    to separate the source counts from that of the diffuse x  ray background",
    ", we performed an on / off analysis .",
    "this method also removes the contribution of the so - called non - cosmic x  ray background radiation ( snowden _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) . in order to obtain quantitative information about the spectrum of the x  ray feature",
    ", we evaluated the standard rosat hardness ratios ( hr1 and hr2 ) , which range from -1 ( soft ) to 1 ( hard ) .",
    "we took this approach because the number of photons is too low for a standard analysis of the x  ray spectrum .",
    "we divided the rosat energy band into the three main energy bands , denoted as rosat c - band ( 0.25kev , pi channels 11 - 41 ) the m - band ( 0.75kev , 52 - 90 ) and j - band ( 1.5kev , 91 - 201 ) .",
    "the evalution of hr2 which is nearly unaffected by galactic absorption yields a value of hr2=@xmath38 .",
    "this leads to a first estimate of the temperature of log(t[k])@xmath116.8 .",
    "adopting this estimate we can correct the soft bands for photoelectric absorption by the galactic ism ( snowden _ et al .",
    "this analysis yields hr1=@xmath39 and the following photon counts for energies below and above 1 kev : @xmath40cts and @xmath41cts .",
    "this simple approach indicates that the x  ray feature emits most of its photons below @xmath42kev .",
    "combined with the fact that the source is elongated , this suggests that a high mass , or even low mass x ",
    "ray binary is unlikely to be the source of the detected emission .",
    "it should be noted though that a possible contribution from x  ray binaries to the observed x ",
    "ray emission can not be ruled out completely at this point .",
    "using the hardness ratios and assuming a reduced metallicity of about 15% solar ( as derived in a few regions in ic2574 by miller & hodge 1994 ) , we calculate a plasma temperature range , according to raymond & smith ( 1977 ) , of log(@xmath43[k])=6.97.1 .",
    "if the x  ray plasma within the hole contains more metals the temperature will be lower ( log(@xmath44[k])=6.46.8 ) .",
    "note that a higher abundance is more likely since the interior of the shell has recently been enriched by the heavy elements ejected by the sne that created the hole . as a result the true temperature will lie somewhere in between",
    "; we adopt a temperature of log(@xmath8)\\,=\\,6.8\\pm0.3 $ ] for the remainder of this paper .    for a plasma of log(@xmath8)\\,=\\,6.8\\pm 0.3",
    "$ ] and a reduced metallicity we evaluate an emission measure of @xmath45 .",
    "assuming an extent of the line of sight through the x  ray cavity of 700pc , we derive an electron density of @xmath46 .",
    "this value is similar to the densities found in the supergiant shell sgs2 in ngc4449 ( 0.03@xmath47 ) or in the lmc4 ( @xmath48 ) ( bomans _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . the total x  ray luminosity of the interior of the hole is @xmath49ergss@xmath7 which lies in between the values for sgs2 in ngc4449 ( @xmath50ergss@xmath7 ) and lmc4 ( @xmath51ergss@xmath7 ) .",
    "this luminosity is about one order of magnitude higher than predicted by theoretical models ( see , e.g. , the calculations by chu",
    "_ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , as is the case with most x  ray luminosities determined thus far ( n11 being the only exception to date  see the discussion by mac  low _ et al .",
    "if we assume that the supergiant shell is the result of a recent sf event , the picture which emerges from the observations discussed above is the following : about @xmath52  years ago ( the dynamical age of the hole ) , a major sf event took place at the center of what today shows up as a prominent hole .",
    "since its creation some @xmath53  ergs of energy have been deposited by the most massive stars , into the ambient ism . about 10% of this energy is now still present in the form of the kinetic energy of the expanding shell .",
    "note that the least massive stars that go off as sn are most probably still present in the cavity since their lifetime ( @xmath54 years ) is somewhat longer then the dynamical age of the hole .",
    "in other words , there is still some energy input going on today which might explain why the derived temperature for the interior of the hole is at the upper end for supergiant shells .",
    "on the other hand , a larger than expected contribution from x  ray binaries may also explain the high temperature estimate .",
    "adopting a sound speed of 100  @xmath1  for the coronal gas filling the hole , we derive a time of only @xmath55  years before a soundwave actually reaches the rim of the shell .",
    "the gas has therefore had enough time to establish a relatively uniform distribution within the cavity . for a plasma temperature of log(@xmath8)\\,=\\,6.8\\pm0.3",
    "$ ] and an internal density of @xmath56@xmath9 we derive an internal pressure of @xmath57k@xmath9 ( lmc4 : p @xmath58k@xmath9 ) .",
    "this value has to be compared to the much lower pressure of the ambient warm ionized medium ( @xmath59k@xmath9 ) .",
    "this means that it is probably this hot gas which is still driving the expansion of the shell ( see , e.g. , weaver _",
    "et al .  _ 1977 ) . the shell , as it is sweeping up material , has already reached the point at which secondary star formation can take place , as evidenced by the regions located along its perifery .",
    "the energy of the hot  gas interior can be approximated by @xmath60 and yields a value of @xmath10ergs .",
    "the model by weaver _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1977 ) predicts that about 50  % of the total energy deposited by sne goes into the thermal heating of the gas interior a superbubble .",
    "our values indicate that , within the errors , indeed most of the energy deposited by the sn explosions has gone into the heating of the gas .",
    "note that a small decrease in temperature and increase in the ambient density would bring these numbers in even closer agreement .",
    "in fact , it is the broad agreement of the observed numbers with those derived from theory which gives us added confidence that it is indeed hot diffuse gas that fills the cavity rather than a cluster of x  ray binaries .",
    "a definitive answer will have to await the better spectral and spatial resolution of future x  ray missions , such as axaf and xmm , which are expected to shed further light on this unique object .",
