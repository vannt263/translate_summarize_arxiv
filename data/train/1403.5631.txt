    "bolometers are now the most sensitive receivers for astrophysical observations in the submillimetre spectral range .",
    "after decades of improvement , they are able to operate with a sensitivity limited by the photon noise of the observed source when operated outside of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the principle of a bolometer is that the heat deposited by the incoming radiation is measured by a thermometer .",
    "the theory of bolometers has been developed in founding papers @xcite and refined later @xcite .",
    "they have shown that their photometric responsivity strongly depends on its interaction with the readout electronics , through the variation of the electrical power deposited in the thermometer ( the electro - thermal feedback ) .",
    "these theories have been developed for a semiconductor thermometer element biased by a direct current ( dc ) voltage through a load resistor .",
    "the readout electronics for bolometers experienced a radical change more than a decade ago .",
    "most of them are now using a modulated bias current in order to get rid of low frequency noises that plague amplification systems @xcite .    the theory developed for a dc bias",
    "must be altered for alternative current ( ac ) biased bolometers in the presence of stray capacitance in the circuit .",
    "this was evidenced in the planck - hfi instrument @xcite in spite of the fact that the readout electronics had been designed @xcite to mimic , as far as possible , the operation of a dc bias .",
    "very significant differences were found in absolute responsivity and even in value of the optimal bias current for the planck bolometers .",
    "this was shown to be mostly due to the effect of parasitic capacitances in the wiring , which can not be neglected in many practical experimental setups .",
    "this effects have been studied in several papers dedicated to the characterization of bolometers and calorimeters by measuring their effective impedance ( e.g. @xcite ) , but we are here essentially interested in effective tools able to predict the responsivity and optimise the tuning of bolometers in specific configurations .",
    "brute force modelling based on numerical integration of thermal and electrical equations of the bolometers proved to be feasible but computationally too heavy to be applied on wide ranges of the many parameters of the models . to facilitate the computation , we have developed an analytical model of the responsivity of ac biased semiconductor bolometers .",
    "this model was used as an aid to predict the behaviour of the bolometer of planck - hfi and to optimize their tuning .",
    "its numerical application proved to be flexible and fast enough to study the effects of all variable parameters .",
    "this paper describes this analytical model and its application with a set of parameters not too far from the realistic cases encountered in planck - hfi .",
    "the next section is dedicated to the differential equations driving the thermal and the electrical behaviour of the electro - thermal system comprising the bolometer and its readout electronics .",
    "it focuses on the derivation of an analytical solution giving the responsivity for both the dc and ac biased cases .",
    "section three addresses the various noises encountered and shows that the optimal bias currents are different in the two cases . in the fourth section",
    "the model is applied to analyze the effects of some essential parameters ( cold stage temperature , modulation frequency , value of the stray capacitance , optical background ) .",
    "section five deals with the shape of the periodic bias wave to cover the case of square bias current used in planck - hfi .",
    "let us consider a low temperature bolometer consisting of an absorber attached to a semiconductor thermometer .",
    "the bolometer is attached to a heat sink at temperature @xmath0 through a thermal link of thermal conductance @xmath1 .",
    "the incoming optical power deposits energy in the absorber and heats the whole bolometer including the thermometer .",
    "the absorbed optical power will determine the equilibrium temperature @xmath2 of the bolometer :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the total power dissipated in the bolometer that is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the absorbed radiant power and @xmath7 is the electrical power .",
    "@xmath1 can be well represented in many cases by :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the static thermal conductance at temperature @xmath0 ( @xmath10 in the case we investigate here ) .",
    "the dominant electrical conduction mechanism in the thermometer is the variable range hopping between localised sites and the resistance of the device varies with both applied voltage and temperature .",
    "the relation between the resistance and the temperature of the bolometer @xcite is set by : @xmath11    where @xmath12 is a characteristic parameter of the material , @xmath13 is a parameter depending on the material and the geometry of the element , @xmath14 is related to the average hopping distance and @xmath15 is the electric field across the device . in absence of electrical non - linearities and other effects such as electron - phonon decoupling , the thermistor resistance depends only on temperature : @xmath16    the impedance changes induced by the temperature variations can be measured by an appropriate readout circuit that we are going to detail and discuss hereafter .           the readout electronics is designed to measure the impedance of the temperature sensitive element of the bolometer .",
    "this is done by injecting a current , and therefore depositing power in the bolometer , which changes its temperature .",
    "consequently , the bolometer responsivity and performance strongly depend on the design of the readout electronics .",
    "the responsivity @xmath17 is the derivative of the bolometer voltage with respect to the optical absorbed power @xmath18 :    @xmath19    it is a strong indicator of the coupling efficiency achieved by readout electronics for a given bolometer .    we compare here after the responsivity obtained with a classical dc bias and a sine - shape ac bias .",

    "the optical power @xmath32 absorbed by the bolometer and the responsivity of the bolometer can be directly computed in the time domain . on the other hand ,",
    "a dc bias current increases the level of low frequency noise , like flicker noise , making the detection of a faint and slowly varying optical signal impossible .",

    "[ fig : comp ] it is clear that in both cases ( ac and dc ) , the responsivity strongly depends on the bias current in the bolometer .",

    "we want to present a general result , not depending on the preamplifier noise level . since our practice and all the simulations ( see fig . [",

    "the amplitude and the position of the peak responsivity are different for the two types of bias current . in the case presented in fig .",

    "we are now interested in establishing the performance of ac readout electronics biased with a sine wave",
    ". we will derive the responsivity , the nep and how the nep depends on the main parameters ( stray capacitance , modulation frequency , optical background and plate temperature ) for three typical bolometers optimized to observe the sky between 0.3 and 3 mm cooled to a temperature of 100 mk . in order to obtain an analytical solution to this problem , we developed a model in the frequency domain using the fourier formalism .",
    "the results could be also obtained in the case of a square ac model .",
    "the two methods are detailed in the appendices a and b.              the first stage of preamplifiers for semiconductors bolometers are classically j - fets giving optimal performance at 100 k or more .",

    "[ fig : nepvscpsin ] , we plot for our three test bolometers the excess of nep versus the value of the stray capacitance . for a typical value of 150 pf ,",
    "the nep excess is several percents ( from 4 % to 8 % ) .",
    "let us note here that the dc bias case is identical to an ac case without stray capacitance .",
    "as we have seen in previous section , the use of an ac bias has the advantage of presenting a noise spectrum flat down to very low frequencies , while dc biased readouts show a large 1/f component at frequencies less than about 10 hz .",
    "the modulation frequency of the electronics will be chosen therefore taking into account the requirement of keeping the flicker noise less then the johnson noise but also taking into account the scanning strategy of the instrument and the angular responsivity of the optics . in the case of planck hfi for example",
    "@xcite the full width at half maximum @xmath64 ranges from 5 to 9 arcmin and the scanning speed is 6 degrees per second .",
    "so , in the limit of small angles , the maximum frequency of interest is given by the relation :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the frequency of the optical modulation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nepvsfmodsin ] we consider the excess nep with respect to a 85 hz modulation frequency . in the worst case",

    "the background strongly affects the static performance of a bolometer by changing the operating point . with respect to others parameters ,",
    "the background is the most uncertain and variable parameter during an observational campaign .",
    "a good understanding of the effect of the optical background on the static performances of a bolometers is therefore a key point during the calibration of the instrument . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nepvswopthfi ] we present the relative variation of the total nep versus the nominal background for our test bolometers .",

    "the degradation in nep is 2 % with respect the nominal background for a background increase of + 16.5 % .",
    "following the first order thermal model of a bolometer ( eq .  [ bolo ] ) , we know that a change in temperature of the plate corresponds exactly to a change of background power on the bolometer . in this case the equivalent power generated from a change of the plate temperature is :    @xmath67    our test bolometers were designed for a plate temperture of 100 mk . the nep variation in the range 95 mk  105 mk",
    "is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : nepvst0hfi ] .",
    "we find that a change of the plate temperature of 1 mk gives a change in nep of 0.8 % in the worst case .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nepcomp ] . the sine case is better for both responsivity and nep .",
    "this is more obvious for the responsivity ( better by about 10 % ) than for the total nep ( better by about 4 % ) .",
    "we conclude that in terms of nep , a bolometer connected to a sine ac biased readout electronics would be more sensitive .",
    "let us remark that the difference in nep is modest .",
    "let us also notice that an ac sine bias would induce significant variations in the temperature of the fastest bolometers , bringing them into the non - linear regime . on the contrary , the square bias deposits a nearly constant power in the bolometers , that deviate from their mean temperature only by small amounts .",

    "it allowed us to predict the responsivity and the noise of semi - conductor bolometers cooled at 100 mk and biased by ac currents in a realistic environment .",
    "it sheds some light on the differences between ac and dc biased bolometer and on the different optimal bias currents for these two cases .",
    "three test bolometers rather similar to planck s ones were used to illustrate our results .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * the ac responsivity is always lower than the dc responsivity .",
    "this is due to a more effective electro - thermal feedback .",
    "the resulting excess of nep depends on the relative part of the preamplifier noise in the total nep . in our test cases the excess nep ranges from 4 % to 10 % , which is more than compensated for by shifting of the low frequency noises out of the range of useful frequencies .",
    "frequencies down to 1 mhz are measurable with a well designed ac readout electronics . *",
    "the ac bias rms current providing to the maximum of the responsivity is about twice larger than that obtained for a dc bias .",
    "this concerns the current through the bolometer and results from the different electro - thermal feedback . * for a stray capacitance of @xmath68 150 pf we obtain an excess nep of 10 % in the worst case ( 3  mm bolometer ) and 4% in the best case ( 0.3 mm bolometer ) .",
    "* around a modulation frequency of 90 hz , the excess nep ranges between 0.2 % and 0.5 % per hz . *",
    "the sensitivity of nep to background is dlog(nep)/dlog(wbg ) = 0.22 to 0.42 * the sensitivity of nep to the plate temperature is dlog(nep)/dlog(tplate ) = 0.3 to 0.8 around 100 mk , but is rather non - linear . * the performances of a sine bias are better than the square bias . in our test cases ,",
    "this result is more obvious in the responsivity ( better by about 10 % ) than in the total nep ( better by about 4 % ) .",
    "but non - linear effects may show up in the sine case for bolometers fast enough to respond to the modulation frequency .",
    "let us consider the bias circuit of fig .",
    "[ fig : acmod ] with a stray capacitance in parallel to the bolometer and a load capacitance in series .",
