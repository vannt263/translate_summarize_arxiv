    "variable radio sources probe extreme physical conditions in the universe : the sparks that emerge from high energy density regions around compact objects such as black holes , neutron stars , and magnetized stars , and the glowing embers that appear in the afterglow of relativistic explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the pulse is inferred to originate outside of the galaxy , possibly at a distance of a billion light years , implying a source of enormous energy density .",
    "subsequent investigations have supported both cosmological @xcite and terrestrial origins @xcite for similar events .",
    "the so - called `` lorimer burst '' is controversial , however , because of the possibility that the event is due to man - made radio signals or radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "rfi presents a significant limitation on the ability to detect and characterize pulsed emission .",
    "man - made radio signals occur throughout the radio spectrum , are variable in time and frequency , and can be strong enough to be detected in the far - out sidelobes of the antenna primary beam response @xcite .",
    "examples of rfi are satellite transmissions , aircraft communications , radar , tv , radio , cell phone , and other point - to - point communication systems . in the time domain",

    "* ) in which a small reference antenna is employed for detection of a voltage stream that contains the rfi but not the astronomical signal .",
    "cross - correlation of the two voltage streams can generate weights that are used to subtract the reference stream from the astronomy stream .",

    "@xcite discusses the theory of using aic with telescope arrays .",
    "laboratory and field tests have demonstrated that the technique can effectively cancel interferers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "aic has an advantage over other techniques , in that it makes no assumption about the frequency- or time - domain characteristics of the rfi .",
    "searches for dispersed pulses should robustly cope with a wide variety of interference , producing low false detection rates with little impact on sensitivity to true astronomical impulses .",

    "data from the ata were captured in a fast spectrum fly s eye mode @xcite in which each antenna can be pointed to a different patch of the sky in order to cover a large area at the expense of interferometric information and thus spatial resolution . in this mode , the digitally sampled waveform from each antenna in the array is mixed to baseband and converted to the frequency domain ( channelized ) via fourier techniques ; in this case , a 128 channel streaming polyphase filterbank is computed over 512-sample windows .",
    "successive channelized windows are accumulated as a power spectrum and the cumulative spectra are written rapidly to disk .",
    "we recorded 128-channel accumulated power spectra at a continuous rate of 1600 spectra per second for each of 44 antennas using 8 bits of precision .",
    "data were obtained at rf frequencies that spanned from 1325 to 1535 mhz .",
    "accumulated power spectra are known as incoherent data because the detection process removes phase information from the signal .    figure  [ fig : crabs ] shows two examples of dispersed pulses from the crab pulsar as observed in ata fast spectrum data .",
    "the left - hand plot shows a strong detection , with signal to noise ( snr ) of 26.5 , while the right - hand plot shows an event with snr of 6.7 .",
    "the crab pulsar has a dispersion measure of @xmath1 , which translates to a 35 ms delay between the highest and lowest frequency channels in the observed band .",
    "the curves follow the expected quadratic dependence of the cold plasma dispersion relation",

    "ms is an rfi impulse that affects all frequency channels , whereas the horizontal segment beginning at 310 ms is a transient rfi event at a single frequency , 1380 mhz .",
    "the right - hand image shows two prominent features ; a 60 cycle per second pattern synchronized over all frequencies and a 20 ms period of time , ending at 300 ms , in which all frequencies have lower power than usual .",
    "several of the frequency channels in either image have power levels that are sharply higher than adjacent channels and subtle horizontal striations indicate that power does not always vary smoothly with frequency .",
    "the goal of this work is to mitigate the effects of these and other types of rfi in anomaly detection in fly s eye data .",
    "five rfi filtering methods are discussed below : _ time centering _ removes means for each time sample in a spectrogram whereas _ frequency centering _ removes means for each frequency ; _ energy clipping _",
    "normalizes spectra whose total energy exceeds a threshold ; _ huber normalization _ is a nonlinear high - pass normalizing filter in the time direction that clips outlying pixels to @xmath2 standard deviations ; and _ adaptive interference cancellation _ ( aic ) cleans the signal from a target antenna by removing any correlated portion that it shares with a set of reference antennas .",
    "each filter operates on a _ spectrogram _",

    "filters are sometimes used in series , so each input spectrogram may have already been modified by a previous filter .",

    "the operator notation , @xmath19 , mnemonically indicates a _ time _ centering filter .",
    "a frequency centering filter subtracts frequency means from a spectrogram , thus operating in the opposite direction of time centering .",
    "however , frequency centering is implemented on successive time windows of a spectrogram to limit the memory requirements for filtering a long stream of spectra .",

    "this operation can be parallelized independently over the frequencies .",
    "signals showing sudden spikes in the energies at all frequencies are likely to be terrestrial in origin .",

    "@xcite achieved attenuation of 72 db in the first aic system used in the radio astronomy domain .",
    "the value of using more than one reference antenna was also made explicit : it permits cancellation of a greater number of uncorrelated noise sources .",
    "we use the primary idea of aic  subtracting interference identified by correlating with reference antennas  but adapt it to the fast spectrum data collected by ata in fly s eye mode .",
    "the major difference from typical applications is that phase information is not available in the ata energy spectra .",
    "even so , interference can be estimated by dynamic linear combinations of the primary and reference spectra .",
    "subtracting estimated interference from the primary spectra mitigates its impact on dispersed pulse detection .",
    "aic assumes that a primary sensor receives a signal of interest plus interference that is not correlated with the signal .",
    "in addition , some number of reference sensors do not receive the signal of interest but do receive the same interference as the primary sensor plus noise that is uncorrelated with the interference .",
    "these are reasonable assumptions for fly s eye data because individual antennas are sensitive to astronomical signals originating in different regions of the sky and both atmospheric and terrestrial rfi typically infect multiple antennas .",
    "an important quality of aic is that it makes very few assumptions about the characteristics of the interference .",
    "aic can be used to mitigate a wide class of rfi that appears simultaneously in multiple antennas . if a specific rfi pattern is prevalent ( e.g. , the 60 hz signals common in radio astronomy observations ) , then an effective rfi filter can be designed to mitigate that specific type of signal .",
    "aic is likely to be somewhat less efficient at mitigating specific known interference patterns , but aic is adaptive in the sense that it will handle a wide class of interferers without the need to design a different filter for each type of interference .",

    "the aic formulation is effective , however , even when the intensity of rfi varies by antenna and by frequency because the projection onto @xmath87 is the best ( least - squares ) linear combination of the reference windows for estimating the rfi in the target input sequence @xmath94 .",
    "the algorithm requires specification of the window width @xmath23 and the set of reference signals .",
    "we set @xmath101 samples , which , at the sampling rate of 1600 hz , is about 400 ms .",
    "choice of reference signals is discussed in section  [ sec : methods ] .    note that for the fly s eye data we are operating on power spectra rather than time - series voltage data , which is the conventional target .",
    "nevertheless , the projection method described here applies to both and can be used to remove rfi .",
    "examples of chirped signals from the crab pulsar appear in figure  [ fig : crabs ] .",
    "the presence of a chirp is indicated by higher than expected values of energy in the pixels along the _ chirp path_. we define the chirp path with time index @xmath6 and dispersion measure as @xmath102 this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : chirppath ] for @xmath103 and a specific dispersion measure .",
    "the black curves are chirps starting at @xmath104 with dispersion delay given by the cold plasma dispersion law .",
    "the grid of dashed lines indicates pixel boundaries in a spectrogram .",
    "if the center of a pixel lies between the chirps then it is in the chirp path for the given start time ( @xmath6 ) and dispersion measure ( dm ) .",
    "while there are many other ways that a discrete chirp path could be defined , this definition has the desirable quality that every pixel in the spectrogram belongs to one and only one chirp path for a given dispersion measure .",
    "therefore , successive chirp paths do not share pixels and so are statistically independent of each other as long as the energy values at different pixels are independent of each other .",
    "our approach to determining whether a chirp is present along a chirp path is to perform a standard t - test comparing the mean energy for pixels in the chirp path to the mean for pixels in the background .",
    "the set of background pixels for a chirp starting at time @xmath6 with dispersion measure @xmath105 is denoted as @xmath106 and consists of pixels concurrent with the chirp path but excluding the chirp path , as indicated by gray shading in figure  [ fig : chirppath ] .",
    "the t - test and the effects of deviations from its sampling assumptions are discussed in many introductory statistics tests ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the gaussian assumption becomes less important with larger samples .",
    "non - constant means and variances in the chirp path or the background have the potential to affect both the false alarm rate of the test statistic and its ability to make correct detections . a large",
    "t - score indicates the presence of a chirp .",
    "if the pixels in @xmath107 and @xmath106 are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) samples drawn from gaussian distributions , then the t - scores are drawn from a t - distribution with @xmath108 degrees of freedom .    in this paper",
    "we only explore analysis of pulses with a width equal to the sampling time .",
    "real astronomical pulses , however , can have widths much larger than the sampling time . these broader pulses can be addressed through hierarchical averaging of the time series data and application of the same chirp integration .    as discussed in section  [ sec : predictingfa ] , these assumptions do not hold , and this may affect whether a fixed threshold for the t - score can produce a false detection rate that is consistent over time .",
    "it is desirable to make accurate predictions about the false detection rate for a given detection threshold .",
    "being able to predict the number of false alarms would allow setting a detection threshold to achieve an allowable false alarm rate .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know of any way to predict the number of false alarms in the presence of rfi because rfi invalidates the statistical independence assumptions typically required for estimating false detections . for example , since the pixels values in the spectrogram are not independent in the presence of rfi , successive chirp sums are not independent if we do not completely remove rfi .",
    "nonetheless , as rfi filters improve , we expect that it will be possible to predict the number of false alarms more accurately .",
    "thus , for the detection techniques described above , we discuss methods for predicting the number of false alarms assuming that no chirp and no rfi is present .",
    "to predict the number of false alarms , we assume that successive t - scores are samples from a t - distribution .",
    "when the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath108 ) is large ( greater than 50 typically suffices ) the t - distribution approximates a standard gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , since approximately 2.5% of standard gaussian draws are greater than 1.96 , we estimate a false alarm rate of 2.5% for a chirp detection threshold of @xmath109 .",
    "a threshold of 6 gives an estimated false alarm rate of @xmath110 .",
    "for the ata , one hour of data from each of 44 antennas sampled at 1600 samples / second contains 253,440,000 samples .",
    "therefore , a threshold of 6 should yield approximately 1 false alarm every 4 hours , using a gaussian approximation to the distribution of t - scores .",
    "there are reasons to be skeptical of our attempt to estimate the number of false alarms even in the absence of rfi .",
    "for example , the assumption that successive t - scores obtained by either of our methods are independent is incorrect , since the pixels used to compute the t - score at time @xmath6 include pixels used to calculate the t - score at time @xmath111 .",
    "the effect of the lack of independence is not clear , except that our estimates of the false alarm rate should deviate from the actual false alarm rate .",
    "in addition , the mean and variance estimates obtained using ewmt change slowly , so may not be good estimates at the onset or offset of rfi .",
    "there is reason to expect that many types of rfi will decrease the false alarm rate below our expectations .",
    "many types of rfi and other noise sources will increase the variance of the pixel energies . since this variance is in the denominator of the t - score",
    ", we expect that our estimate of the false alarm rate will be higher than the actual false alarm rate in the presence of rfi .",
    "an unfortunate corollary is that we expect lower t - scores for chirps in rfi , implying that we will be more likely to miss chirps embedded in rfi .",
    "however , a decrease in detection rate may be preferable to excising segments of spectrograms containing rfi .",
    "we tested various combinations of the rfi mitigation filters described in section [ sec : rfi ] on ata data in fly s eye mode .",
    "specifically , one hour of power spectrograms was extracted simultaneously from 44 receivers with 128 frequency channels from @xmath112 mhz to @xmath113 mhz , with a frequency resolution of @xmath114 mhz per channel .",

    "these are some of the worst cases .",
    "the vast majority of data segments would appear as white noise in this type of display .",
    "each spectrogram in figure  [ fig : embed ] also has an artificially embedded chirp that is visible beginning at 100 ms in the highest frequency of each segment and sweeping through the frequency band over about 35 ms of time .",
    "these 10 segments include impulsive rfi , such as the white vertical lines in ( h ) and ( i ) , as well as single - frequency transients , such as the horizontal streaks at about 1375 mhz in ( b ) and ( j ) .",
    "the black and white bands in ( a ) alternate at 60 cycles per second , which is likely an instrumentation artifact , along with the similar but subtler patterns in ( b ) , ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "we refer to all of this clutter as rfi , even though some of it is not likely to have originated in the radio frequency domain .",
    "the artificial chirps in figure  [ fig : embed ] have a @xmath115 corresponding to that of the crab pulsar . to embed a chirp starting at a particular time , we added energy to appropriate frequency bins in each spectrogram during the duration of the chirp .",
    "we use the cold plasma dispersion law to find the chirp frequency for each time sample from the start of the chirp to the end of the chirp . for each time sample during a chirp , energy was typically added to two frequency bins  the two bins bordering the chirp frequency  with the total energy @xmath116 split in proportion to the distances between the bin frequencies and the chirp frequency . for example , if the embedded chirp has frequency @xmath117 and the bordering bins have center frequencies @xmath118 and @xmath119 , then energy @xmath120 is added to the bin with frequency @xmath118 and the remainder is added to the next higher bin .",
    "the examples in figure  [ fig : embed ] show embedded chirps with energy level @xmath121 .",
    "this is the strongest of four energy levels used for this study : 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.25 and 2.0 .",
    "( although measurements in our spectrograms are proportional to energy , at the time these data were collected the ata fly s eye mode did not calibrate each antenna to an absolute reference .",
    "therefore , embedding chirps with fixed energy @xmath116 into uncalibrated data equates to embedding signals of differing absolute strength , depending on the antenna gain . )    ) and weakest ( @xmath122 ) embedded energy on the ( j ) section of rfi.,title=\"fig : \" ] + ) and weakest ( @xmath122 ) embedded energy on the ( j ) section of rfi.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    figure  [ fig : embed2 ] shows the rfi in panel ( g ) from figure  [ fig : embed ] with the chirp embedded at the strongest ( @xmath123 , top ) and weakest ( @xmath122 , bottom ) energy levels . the weak chirp is barely visible in the lower image but was detected at a level as low as 5 false alarms in 138 million time samples , equivalent to one full day of observing .    figure  [ fig : flow ] illustrates the process we used to compare the effectiveness with which various filtering strategies ( discussed further below ) mitigate rfi .    , and a given rfi filter .",
    "this was repeated for each combination of four signal strengths and six filters.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    each of the 44 antenna output files used for our study is approximately an hour in length .",
    "seven of these files were used to provide examples of rfi . in three of the seven files , we studied rfi at two different times , and in the remaining four , we chose only a single time , making total of 10 different rfi exemplars as shown in figure  [ fig : embed ] .",
    "chirps were embedded with each of the four energy levels listed above in each of the 10 exemplars for a total of 40 examples of embedded chirps .",
    "the data set with embedded chirps is referred to as the _ test set_.    another 17 of the 44 files were randomly selected , so that together with the seven files in the test set , a total of 24 files are identified as the _ reference set_. the reference set represents approximately 24 hours worth of data .",
    "the reference set was processed identically to the test set and used to determine how many false alarms to expect per day for thresholds corresponding to detection of each of the 40 different embedded signals .    from the remaining 20 files ( those not used in the reference set ) ,",
    "10 were randomly chosen as the cleaning signals to use with aic filtering .",
    "the remaining 10 files were not used in the tests reported here . each filtering strategy aimed at mitigating rfi",
    "was applied to both the test set and the reference set , followed by t - test calculations for chirp detection .",
    "the number of t - scores in the reference set greater than or equal to the t - score for each embedded chirp in the test set is the number of false alarms .",
    "false alarm counts were computed for each combination of four energy levels and the 10 rfi sections in the reference set , giving 40 false alarms counts for a given filtering strategy .",
    "six filtering strategies were tested using the processing described above and illustrated in figure  [ fig : flow ] .",
    "each filtering strategy consists of a combination of the mitigation filters presented in section  [ sec : rfi ] .",
    "the six strategies , identified by short names , are defined below and rationale is given for the specific choices selected for each strategy .",
    "frequency centering and aic filters operate on consecutive time windows of spectrograms . in each case",
    "below , the window size was set to @xmath101 samples , corresponding to 400 ms time windows .",
    "this window size is about 11 times longer than the embedded chirps so that the chirp represents only a small fraction of data in a window .",
    "the filtering strategies are as follows :    none : : :    is the t - test detector on the raw spectrograms  no filter is applied .",
    "this is included for reference , even though it is not a competitive    strategy .",
    "center freq : : :    is frequency centering in which frequency means are subtracted from    successive spectrogram windows . this filter is included primarily for    a comparison with the following strategy .",
    "center freq + aic : : :    applies frequency centering to the file to be cleaned and to each of    the 10 aic cleaning files .",
    "then aic is run on each window of the    spectrogram . comparing this strategy to the previous one",
    "allows for    measuring the value of the more complex aic calculations beyond the    simple frequency centering calculations .",
    "if no reference signals were    used in the aic cleaning algorithm , aic would be identical to the    `` center freq '' approach above . to emphasize that aic centers the    frequencies _ and _ uses additional reference signals , we write `` center    freq + aic '' for the case where frequency centering is applied to the    file to be cleaned and to each of the 10 aic cleaning files before    applying aic .",
    "center freq , time : : :    performs frequency centering ( in windows ) and then time centering .",
    "this allows for comparing the value of time centering beyond that of    frequency centering ( the second strategy ) and provides a reference for    the following strategy .",
    "center freq , time + aic : : :    is frequency and time centering ( as above ) on the file to be cleaned    and on each file in the aic cleaning set .",
    "then aic is run on each    window of the spectrogram .",
    "comparison to the previous strategy shows    the incremental value of aic beyond two - way centering .",
    "huber + center time + energy truncation : : :    first applies huber filtering with @xmath124 , and    @xmath42 .",
    "next the mean energy at each time is removed .",
    "finally the energy clipping filter is applied with a threshold of    @xmath125 .",
    "this strategy is intended to determine the value    of outlier mitigation as implemented in huber filtering and energy    clipping .",
    "choices of @xmath57 and @xmath126 come from    setting the effective window width to 1600 samples    ( @xmath127 ) , so that the smoothing is scaled to one    second of time .",
    "this is much longer than the 400 ms used for aic and    frequency centering .",
    "the rationale is that the combination of huber    filtering and energy clipping mitigates outlying rfi data values so    that smoothing can be done on longer time scales without the risk of    bad data corrupting the filter output for a prolonged period .",
    "the    value @xmath42 should clip approximately 5% of the individual    data values in the huber thresholding function .",
    "similarly    @xmath125 is the 0.95 quantile of the @xmath128    distribution with @xmath129 degrees of freedom and this    should clip energy from approximately 5% of the normalized spectra as    explained in section  [ sec : energy - clipping - ct ] .",
    "these are reasonable    choices informed by usual practices in application of robust    statistics .",
    "a good measure of the ability of a filter combination to mitigate rfi and retain the signal of a chirp is the count of t - scores greater than or equal to the t - score of a given chirp .",
    "for example , after embedding a chirp in one of the test - set files and running a given filter combination over the data , suppose the chirp generates a t - score of @xmath130 .",
    "the number of false alarms for this case is determined by counting how many t - scores are greater than @xmath130 when the same filtering is applied to the 24 hour reference set with no embedded chirps .",
    "false detection counts are obtained for each embedded chirp in combination with each choice of rfi filter .",
    "figure  [ fig : alarms ] plots false detections in 24 hours corresponding to each of the 10 rfi examples shown in figure  [ fig : embed ] with various strengths of embedded chirps and various combinations of filtering . within each panel ,",
    "different lines correspond to different filter combinations and each line presents false detections for each of five embedded chirp strengths .",
    "six of the seven lines are for the six filter combinations detailed in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "the seventh , labeled `` aic & huber , '' is discussed below .",
    "false detection counts drop toward zero as the strength of the embedded signal increases .",
    "the vertical axis is scaled to emphasize the low range of false detections .",
    "values above 100 represent chirps that could not reasonably be detected by close individual analysis of all detections in a single day of observation time .        the rfi examples , a ",
    "j , in figure  [ fig : embed ] and the corresponding panels in figure  [ fig : alarms ] are ordered according to decreasing success of the huber filter , center time , and energy clipping combination .",
    "interestingly , centering filters with and without aic tend to perform well when huber does poorly , and vice versa .",
    "in particular , in the top row of plots , the huber filter is uniformly best , while it is not much better than no filtering in the bottom row of plots .",
    "however , the `` center freq .",
    "+ aic '' filter is best in the bottom row of plots , except for case `` i '' where the two frequency and time centering filters do somewhat better .",
    "the fact that the huber filter complements `` center freq .",
    "+ aic '' suggests that a better strategy would be to combine both methods , as described below .",
    "in fact , the lines labeled `` combined aic & huber '' show that the combined aic and huber method does indeed perform well on all ten embedded chirps .",
    "the combined method is not uniformly best , but it is the only strategy that never performs poorly relative to the other filters .",
    "false alarms for the `` combined aic & huber '' strategy were computed as follows .",
    "let @xmath131 denote the minimum of the false detection counts for `` center freq .",
    "+ aic '' and for `` huber + center time + energy truncation '' .",
    "this @xmath131-score is computable from the empirical distribution of @xmath6-scores over the 24 hour reference set and is itself a detection statistic .",
    "a small @xmath131-score near zero denotes strong evidence of a chirp .",
    "for an embedded chirp with @xmath132 , the false detection count is the number of @xmath131-scores in the reference set that are less than or equal to @xmath133 .",
    "these counts are shown in figure  [ fig : alarms ] for the `` combined aic & huber '' method .",
    "radio frequency interference is a dominant limiting factor in the design and performance of fast radio transient experiments .",
    "we present here an analysis of the effectiveness of several rfi mitigation methods , with the goal of a more rigorous statistical understanding of the performance of these filters .",
    "we apply these methods to actual interference present in data obtained as part of the ata fly s eye survey . a search for synthetic dispersed pulses that were added to the interference data",
    "was employed as a means to determine the rate of false detections .",
    "filters explored in various combinations include time centering , frequency centering , adaptive interference cancellation ( aic ) , huber filtering , and energy clipping .",
    "huber filtering in combination with energy clipping and time centering proved very effective at eliminating rfi that was primarily broad in frequency but variable in time . in many cases ,",
    "application of these filters led to zero false positives when applied to 24 hours of data .",
    "for the case of rfi that is predominantly frequency - dependent , the huber filter is largely ineffective . in these cases ,",
    "frequency centering with and without aic is the most effective .",
    "unfortunately , the frequency centering approach produces many false positives for broadband rfi .",
    "a method that combines huber and aic filtering proves uniformly effective over a range of time- and frequency - dependent interferers .",
    "it is the only method explored that will produce a low number of false positives under all rfi examples considered here .",
    "aic is computationally intensive and is applicable to only the subset of experiments in which reference signals are available .",
    "the computational complexity of aic is much higher than that for using a robust filtering approach .",
    "for example , given signals from @xmath25 antennas , each having @xmath36 frequency channels output at each time , we will need to use aic on @xmath134 primary signals with up to @xmath135 reference signals for each primary signal .",
    "this implies that we need to form and solve @xmath134 systems of linear equations for each primary signal in each window of time .",
    "if we use the maximum number of reference signals , then the algorithm does not scale well with increasing numbers of radio antennas .",
    "while modern computing devices are often optimized to do linear algebraic calculations as needed for aic , as the number of antennas grows , the computational burden may eventually be too high .    to decrease the computational costs",
    ", compromises will need to be made .",
    "for example , we may have to arrange radio telescopes so that telescopes that are close to each other point to different locations in space .",
    "this will help ensure that the same noise signals are observed by each telescope but the signals of interest will not be observed by multiple telescopes .",
    "doing this will allow fewer reference signals to be used for each primary signal .",
    "alternately , aic could be used as a second stage of processing to further clean spectra that are suspected of having dispersed impulses .",
    "we need to understand the trade - offs of various aic algorithms , and how the aic algorithms interact with other rfi mitigation techniques as well as pulse detection techniques .",
    "finally , we note that the forms of rfi used for testing these algorithms are by no means exhaustive .",
    "it is certainly of interest to apply these algorithms to data obtained from other telescopes in different rfi environments .",
    "nevertheless , we see promise in huber filtering and aic for mitigation of rfi from incoherent spectra in the search for fast radio transients .    the authors would like to acknowledge the generous support of the paul g. allen family foundation , who have provided major support for design , construction , and operations of the ata .",
