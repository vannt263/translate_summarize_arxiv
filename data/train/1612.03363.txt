    "try to choose this place in such a way as to make as large as possible the angle between the axis passing through the chosen point and the centre of the earth , and the rotated axis determined after some fixed time interval .",
    "if the time period is less than six hours , the choice is simple : we must locate ourselves somewhere on the equator .",
    "however , if the elapsed time is chosen between six and twelve hours , the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "we have to travel north ( or south ) the equator , eventually reaching , for twelve hours , the 45th parallel north ( say on the border between montana and wyoming ) or the 45th parallel south ( e.g. , in becks , a small settlement on the south island of new zealand ) . in the former ` short time ' case , the maximal attainable angle is equal to the earth s angle of rotation , but in the latter , i.e. , when the time is long enough , we can always find a point on the earth ( or , more precisely , a circle of latitude ) such that the angle between the two lines in question is right . now ,",
    "if we swap the earth for the bloch sphere representing qubits , this simple riddle illustrates the difference between two kinds of unitary transformations ( represented here as bloch sphere rotations ) : non - chaotic and chaotic ones .",
    "the exploration of this difference is the main theme of this paper .",
    "the invariant that we shall use to distinguish chaotic unitaries is quantum dynamical entropy .",
    "the notion of ( classical ) _ dynamical entropy _ ( or _ entropy rate _ ) is due to claude e. shannon @xcite , who introduced it into information theory , and andrei kolmogorov @xcite , who made it a basic tool for studying dynamical systems . in",
    "his seminal paper shannon discussed the problem of computing entropy for a discrete and ergodic information source sending messages to a receiver .",
    "this quantity can be determined from the statistics of finite message sequences , namely , it is the limit of entropy of a block of symbols divided by its length , or the limit of conditional entropy of the next symbol given the preceding ones , as the block length tends to infinity . in the kolmogorov - sinai theory the definition of entropy is very similar to shannon s , except that instead of message sequences , the results of discrete measurements ( represented there by finite partitions of the phase space ) are analysed and then the supremum over all such measurements is taken .",
    "the entropy defined in this way is invariant with respect to metric isomorphisms of dynamical systems .",
    "moreover , using the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy , we can formally distinguish _ regular _ systems ( with dynamical entropy equal to zero ) from _ chaotic systems _",
    "( with strictly positive dynamical entropy ) .    in the present paper we consider a quantum analogue of this notion .",
    "we analyse the situation where successive measurements are performed on a finite - dimensional quantum mechanical system whose evolution between two subsequent measurements is given by a quantum operation .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the quantum system is described by a finite - dimensional unitary operator , and the measurement process either by a _",
    "von neumann - lders  instrument _ ( represented by a projection valued measure - pvm ) or by a _ generalised lders instruments , _ disturbing the initial state in the minimal way ( represented by a positive operator valued measure - povm ) .",
    "if the measure consists of rank-1 operators , then such process generates two markov chains : the first one in the space of states ( so - called _ discrete quantum trajectories _ , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the second one in the space of measurement outcomes . the dynamical entropy ( entropy rate ) of the latter can be used to estimate the randomness of the measurement results .    understood in this way",
    ", quantum dynamical entropy was introduced independently by srinivas @xcite , pechukas @xcite , beck and graudenz @xcite , see also @xcite , and recently rediscovered and analysed by crutchfield and wiesner under the name of _ quantum entropy rate _ @xcite .",
    "it is also closely related to the _ entropy of unitary matrices , _ used in different contexts by various authors @xcite . imitating the definition of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy and taking the supremum over the class of pvm measurements , we get the _ pvm - dynamical entropy _ , which depends only on the quantum dynamics and characterizes its ability to produce random sequences of measurement outcomes . in the case of povms",
    "the situation is more complicated as there are two independent sources of randomness that can influence the value of dynamical entropy .",
    "the first is the underlying dynamics of the system , described by a unitary operator .",
    "the second is the povm measurement , which potentially introduces some additional randomness . subtracting the dynamical entropy calculated for trivial ( identity ) dynamics from the original entropy rate , and then taking the supremum over the class of povm measurements , we get another quantity , the _ povm - dynamical entropy _ , which again depends only on the unitary operator and is larger than or equal to its pvm counterpart .",
    "these measurement independent definitions of dynamical quantum entropy for finite - dimensional systems were introduced in a more general setting in @xcite and then developed further in @xcite .",
    "however , only preliminary results have been obtained so far . in the present paper",
    "we study the notion of pvm - dynamical entropy in full details , postponing more comprehensive analysis of the povm - dynamical entropy to further publications .",
    "note that a widely accepted generalization of ks entropy for quantum mechanics has not yet been found , in spite of the fact that several attempts to define such a quantity have been made @xcite .",
    "in particular , the best - known quantum dynamical entropies , such as the connes - narnhofer - thirring ( cnt ) entropy @xcite or the alicki - fannes ( af ) @xcite entropy , vanish for finite - dimensional quantum systems @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",

    "in the closing section we would like to briefly discuss some issues related to the povm - dynamical entropy .",
    "we start by recalling the notion of entropy of a povm . by the _ ( shannon )",

    "@xmath301 , where @xmath302 for @xmath13 ( @xmath8 ) , we mean the function @xmath303 defined by @xmath304 for an input state @xmath18 ; see @xcite for the history and information - theoretic interpretation of this notion . if @xmath305 , we put @xmath306 . applying ( [ formula ] ) , we see that the entropy of @xmath86 with respect to @xmath25 can be expressed as the mean entropy of @xmath25 averaged over the output states of @xmath25 transformed by @xmath41 : @xmath307 and so @xmath308 from ( [ dynentrel ] ) and ( [ meaentrel ] ) we obtain @xmath309\\text{. } \\label{dynfor}%\\ ] ]    for pvms we have @xmath310 .",
    "surprisingly , in the general case we can find situations where intertwining a povm - measurement with some ( or even any ) unitary operator can produce smaller entropy than that generated by the measurement itself .    to illustrate this phenomenon ,",
    "assume that @xmath311 is a sic - povm , i.e. , a rank-1 povm satisfying the condition @xmath312 for @xmath313 , @xmath314 .",
    "then , from ( [ dynfor ] ) and @xcite , we get @xmath315 we also have @xcite the following bound @xmath316 which is known to be actually attained for the ` tetrahedral ' sic - povm in dimension @xmath317 @xcite , for all sic - povms in dimension @xmath263 @xcite , and for the hoggar sic - povm in dimension @xmath318 @xcite . consequently ,",
    "for every @xmath86 we get @xmath319 thus , from this point of view , sic - povms and pvms lie on the opposite ends of the spectrum .",
    "it seems that the interplay between the two kinds of randomness , one coming from the measurement and one associated with unitary evolution , makes the study of the povm - dynamical entropy particularly difficult .",
    "in the present paper we solve some problems concerning chaotic unitaries and pvm - dynamical entropy ; however , many questions remain unanswered .",
    "we get several sufficient and/or necessary conditions for a matrix to maximize the pvm - dynamical entropy ( proposition [ hadamard ] , corollary [ trace ] , theorem [ necess ] ) , but only for qubits ( propositions [ entdyn2 ] and [ chaotic2 ] ) and qutrits ( theorem [ chaotic3 ] ) we can fully describe the set of chaotic unitaries .",
    "the problem of characterising this property in higher dimensions , starting from ququads , remains open .",
    "the fact that the probability of finding a chaotic matrix among unitaries is smaller for qutrits ( theorem [ c3 ] ) than for qubits ( theorem [ c2 ] ) suggests the conjecture that this probability decreases , possibly to zero , when the dimension of the hilbert space grows to infinity .",
    "this contrasts with the result of theorem [ meaent ] that the mean pvm - dynamical entropy increases logarithmically with the dimension and is , in fact , almost as large as possible .    on the other hand ,",
    "extending the definition of the dynamical entropy to other classes of measurements opens up a number of natural questions for further analysis . moving on to a broader class of povms ,",
    "we are faced , especially in the case of sic - povms ( eq .",
    "( [ entsic ] ) ) , with the paradoxical fact that a unitary dynamics combined with a measurement can decrease the randomness , which provides an example of a phenomenon with no classical counterpart .",
    "it is also not clear whether the inequality between the pvm - dynamical entropy and the povm - dynamical entropy can be sharp .    leaving the realm of rank-1 operators , we encounter an even more interesting situation , first described by one of us ( w.s . ) in the more general setting of operational approach to ( quantum ) dynamics and measurement process @xcite , and then by wiesner and co - authors in a series of papers @xcite . in this case the measurement process together with the unitary dynamics still produces a markov chain in the space of states , but the accompanying process generated in the space of the measurement outcomes does not have to be markovian @xcite , which makes computing the dynamical entropy more challenging .",
    "finally , a natural direction for further research is to study the semiclassical limit of the dynamical entropies defined here , see also @xcite .",
