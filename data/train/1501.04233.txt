    "both organs are usually examined with ultrasound probes through natural cavities , therefore the diagnostic capability can be enhanced by fusing the morphological image from ultrasound with a pet metabolic image . the endoscopic approach and the use of the tof information with an unprecedented ctr of 200 ps ( 3 cm along the line of response ) allow to define a specific region of interest ( roi ) and",

    "the distance between two adjacent sipms in the matrix ( center to center ) is 3.6 mm .",
    "these sipms exploit the through silicon via ( tsv ) technology , leading to less dead space and a reduced connection length as compared to conventional wire - bonded sipm .",
    "the following sections describe the experimental setup , the analysis method and the results of the characterization of 256 sipm matrices .",
    "the layout of the experimental laboratory setup is shown in figure [ sipm_setup ] . in a light tight box ,",
    "the sipm matrix is mounted on a motherboard incorporating linear amplifiers ( infineon bga614 ) and high voltage filters .",
    "the signal for each of the 16 sipms of the matrix is obtained using low intensity blue light ( advanced laser diode system , 451 nm ) .",
    "the amplified sipm output is readout by a vme - based charge - to - digital converter ( caen qdc965a ) with a resolution of 25 fc per qdc bin .",
    "the heat generated by the active components on the sipm motherboard is dissipated by a fan .",

    "the first peak corresponds to the pedestal ( zero pixel fired ) while the following peaks correspond to an increasing number of pixels fired .",
    "after the pedestal subtraction , the spectrum is projected into the frequency space using a fast fourier transform .",
    "the period of the first harmonic is taken as the value of the sipm gain ( @xmath3 ) in qdc units , which is then converted into number of electrons by the following formula : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the qdc resolution of 25 fc per qdc bin and @xmath6 is the amplification factor of the readout board ( 19 db , @xmath7 8.9 ) .",
    "the error on the gain is about 1% , obtained as one bin in the fourier space plus an additional uncertainty of 5 @xmath8 , evaluated by repeating the measurement multiple times under the same conditions .",
    "+        figure [ gainfit ] shows the gain dependence on the voltage bias applied .",

    "local differences in temperature have been observed within the sipm matrix , due to the inhomogeneous dissipation of the heat generated by the amplifiers .",
    "therefore an offline temperature correction ( see section [ tempsection ] ) has been applied in order to compare the results .",
    "figure [ ubdhist ] shows the distribution of the breakdown voltages at 25 @xmath17c for all the sipms .",
    "+ although the @xmath13 spread for all the sipm is about 2 v , this must not exceed 0.5 v in each single sipm matrix , because this is the maximum voltage bias tuning range of the asic developed for the sipm readout @xcite @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ vbdminmax ] , all the sipm matrices respect this requirement .",
    "+ finally , the results obtained have been compared to the operating voltages ( @xmath18 ) provided by the sipm producer .",

    "+ the probability of having two dark events in the time @xmath20 is very low , therefore the events corresponding to more than 1 pixel fired are mainly due to correlated noise , which will be described in the next section .",
    "+ the events in the pedestal peak , i.e. the events with charge less than 0.5 pixel threshold , are not affected by correlated noise , hence they are used to calculate the uncorrelated dcr , defined as @xmath21 . + in a time range @xmath22 , the expected number of @xmath21 events @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the number of events in the pedestal distribution is given by the poisson probability density function for zero @xmath21 events in the time @xmath22 : @xmath25 the @xmath21 is therefore calculated using : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of events in the pedestal peak and @xmath28 is the total number of events recorded .",
    "the error on the calculated value depends on the statistic of the sample and on the quality of the spectrum . + for each sipm the @xmath21 is evaluated for 30 voltage levels , in a range of 3 v starting about 1 v above the breakdown voltage .",
    "500k event samples are collected for each voltage point .",
    "+ also the dcr has a dependence on the temperature , therefore a correction ( see section [ tempsection ] ) has been applied in order to compensate for temperature variations .",
