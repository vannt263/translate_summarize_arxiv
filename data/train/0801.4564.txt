    "modern developments in efforts to consistently combine gravity and quantum mechanics have indicated that quantum field theory has too many degrees of freedom .",
    "the entropy of a geometrical object seems to depend on the area of a boundary surface . in the case of a black hole",
    ", thermodynamic arguments suggest that its entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed on the microscopic side by calculations for some special cases of black holes .",
    "the separation of a system into two subsystems gives rise to the notion of the entanglement entropy which quantifies the quantum correlations between the two subsystems .",
    "one can take the subsystems to be two regions of space separated by a boundary surface .",
    "early calculations in quantum field theories indicated that the entanglement entropy between the degrees of freedom in two regions separated by a boundary surface is proportional to the area of the boundary surface  @xcite .",
    "these developments have led to the intuition that the entanglement entropy is dominated by degrees of freedom close to the boundary surface , so it is natural to expect that the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area .",
    "the connection between the entropy of a geometric system , on the one hand , and the entanglement entropy between the quantum field theory degrees of freedom between spatially disconnected regions , on the other hand , is not clear .",
    "there have even been suggestions that the black hole entropy is entirely entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possibility that when the boundary surface is taken to be an event horizon , the two types of entropy are identical or at least related .",
    "therefore it becomes important to examine the properties of entanglement entropy in more general cases and attempt to understand its properties when the entanglement involves regions separated by a horizon .",
    "the entanglement entropy is ultraviolet divergent and must be regularized .",
    "presumably a more fundamental theory at the planck scale will provide the mechanism that eliminates the divergence . since we",
    "are not yet aware of how the underlying theory regularizes the divergence , we are forced to do so by hand in calculations .",
    "the regularization involves the planck scale and the expectation that entanglement entropy may be connected to the theory of quantum gravity is suggested by simple dimensional analysis . if indeed the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of the boundary surface in planck units , then the connection to a holographic principle similar to the one suggested by the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , may apply to the entanglement entropy .",
    "after the initial studies of the entanglement entropy  @xcite , most research in the subject has been devoted to cfts .",
    "when a field theory is conformal , there are additional tools to compute the entanglement entropy , which , in fact , is proportional to the central charge  @xcite .",
    "even when the cft is modified by adding mass deformations  @xcite , the same property holds . also , recent calculations of entanglement entropy in this context suggest a holographic interpretation  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the entanglement entropy and holography has also been discussed in more general contexts  @xcite .",
    "scaling of the entaglement entropy with the area of the boundary have also been verified by numerical computations  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the entanglement entropy of a quantum field theory in the case of an arbitrary boundary surface embedded in a background with spatial curvature .",
    "our results contain many previously derived results as special cases , but are more general because we consider arbitrary geometries .",
    "ultimately one would want to consider the even more general case involving spacetime curvature , so the comparison with other forms of entropy can be made explicit .",
    "in this section , we compute the entanglement entropy by using two main tools , the replica method and the heat kernel method .    in the replica method ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the entropy is expressed as the limit @xmath0 of an expression involving the @xmath1th power of the ( reduced ) density matrix . expressing the density matrix as a path integral",
    ", we are lead to consider the manifold which is the result of gluing @xmath1 copies of the original manifold .",
    "this gives an expression of the entropy in terms of the path integral over closed curves in the glued manifold , which is described in the subsection  [ replica - method ] .",
    "for a free scalar field on an arbitrary base manifold , the resulting path integral is expressed in terms of the spectral quantities of a differential operator .",
    "it is convenient to study these quantities by the heat kernel method .",
    "we use it in the subsection  [ heat - kernel ] to obtain an expression for the entropy in which the dependence on the hypersurface is factored out .",
    "this leads to several properties of the entropy which we derive in the subsection  [ several - properties - of - entropy ] .",
    "in particular , we compute the entropy for a hypersurface which is a direct product of manifolds , prove the addititivity property of the entropy , and compute the leading terms of asymptotic expansions of the entropy .    in the heat kernel method ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the spectral information is obtained from an asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel of the operator .",
    "all terms in the expansion are determined by the geometry of the underlying manifold . although they can be computed in principle , the computations are quite complicated in practice .",
    "the parameters in the resulting asymptotic expansion are an ultraviolet cutoff scale and geometric scales associated with the manifold . in the subsection  [ asymptotics ] , this leads to an asymptotic expansion for the entropy , which involves geometric quantities associated with the hypersurface .",
    "we show that the term proportional to the volume of the manifold is absent and the leading term is proportional to the volume of the hypersurface .",
    "we consider a field theory on a generally curved space which is divided by an arbitrary hypersurface into two parts .",
    "the quantum fields in the two parts are entangled , and our goal is the calculation of the entanglement entropy .",
    "let @xmath2 be an @xmath3 dimensional riemannian manifold without a boundary and let @xmath4 be a closed hypersurface ( a submanifold of codimension @xmath5 ) .",

    "the second equality embodies the replica method ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to obtain the path integral representation for the @xmath1th power of the density matrix we introduce an auxiliary field @xmath21 defined on @xmath22 and which satisfies the boundary condition @xmath23 .",

    "let @xmath25 be an action for the field @xmath26 .",
