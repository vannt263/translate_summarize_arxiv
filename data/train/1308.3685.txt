    "the r - mode instability was first discovered in @xcite and it was predicted that the instability could become a significant source of gravitational radiation .",
    "this happens because the r - modes are generically unstable to the cfs gravitational - radiation - driven instability @xcite .",
    "the r - mode instability follows immeadiately from the fact that r - modes that are prograde with respect to a distant observer are retrograde in the comoving frame for all values of the angular velocity ( the canonical energy of the modes is negative ) . for some nice reviews",
    "see @xcite . however , different mechanisms to damp the instability have to be considered : one of them is viscosity @xcite , another one could be sufficiently strong magnetic fields @xcite . the instability windows for non - magnetized newtoninan stars were initially calculated in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the effect of magnetic fields on r - modes was discussed in @xcite for a spherical shell and in @xcite for a neutron star with purely toroidal field , in all cases in the newtonian context .",
    "this paper is a first part of a project that is supposed to contribute to the understanding of the instability window for slowly rotating relativistic neutron stars with magnetic fields .",
    "we are here interested in and focused on the modification of the r - modes in the presence of magnetic fields and its effects on the gravitational wave emission",
    ". the effect of magnetic fields on the r - mode frequencies could be interesting for astrophysical objects such as magnetars , that have magnetic fields of the order of magnitude @xmath2 g and are very slow rotators with rotational periods of a few seconds .",
    "we consider here stars of comparable magnetic fields with rotational periods of a few milliseconds ( due to a numerical difficulty : longer periods would need longer time evolutions ) .",
    "the issue of viscous damping of the mode , which determines the instability window of the r - mode , is further complicated by the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore we leave it for future work .",
    "we treat the problem within the realm of perturbation theory , first by deriving general perturbation equations and then by solving them numerically with a 2d lax - wendroff method .",
    "the same numerical methods were used and tested in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the 2d dynamical evolution in this case is that it avoids both the r - mode continuous spectrum problem @xcite and the need for truncating the solution at some @xmath9 ( as done for instance in @xcite for torsional modes of a relativistic star with a dipole magnetic field ) .",
    "we first calculate the r - mode frequencies for different values of the rotation parameter and magnetic fields .",
    "then we calculate the instability growth rate due to the emission of gravitational waves as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "( this gives both general relativistic and magnetic field corrections to the results of @xcite . )",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section we describe our background model and in the third section we present the full perturbation equations of our model .",
    "this section is followed by the fourth section , where we compute the r - mode frequencies for different rotation rates of the star , as a function of the magnetic field . in the fifth section",
    "we compute the growth time due to the r - mode gravitational wave emission as a function of magnetic field . in the sixth section we present the concluding remarks .",

    "we work with a slowly and uniformly rotating magnetized star with a polytropic equation of state .",
    "our model neutron star has @xmath11 , @xmath12 km , and the pressure @xmath13 is given by the polytropic equation of state @xmath14 , taken with the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the rest - mass density of the star . the keplerian frequency @xmath18 ( mass shedding limit ) that we use in our paper to normalize the rotation of the star is  @xmath19 .",
    "the effect of the rotation is taken up to the linear order in the rotation parameter @xmath20 , which means one considers the effect of the rotation on the spacetime metric ( frame dragging function ) , but neglects the effect of the rotation on the stellar structure .",
    "( the deformations of the stellar fluid due to rotation are of the order @xmath21 . )",
    "we consider a dipole magnetic field and for the realistic neutron stars with magnetic fields ( up to the order of @xmath22 for magnetars ) , one can neglect the effect of the magnetic field on both the stellar structure and the background metric ( for a more detailed argumentation , see @xcite ) .",

    "moreover , this current profile allows us to consider the magnetic field as force - free at the surface ( the lorentz force goes to zero at the surface of the star as @xmath44 ) .    choosing the vector potential as @xmath45 ( same parity and symmetry choices as we did for @xmath46 above ) ,",

    "( for an analysis of the accuracy of the cowling approximation , but only for f and p modes , see @xcite . for r - modes , the cowling approximation gives more accurate frequencies , as these modes do not involve large density variations @xcite . )",

    "another constraint that has to be fulfilled is the time independent mhd equation , that is checked to be satisfied in each step of the calculation ( up to certain determined numerical error ) .",
    "the time independent mhd constraint is obtained from the perturbed ideal mhd equation by subtracting the appropriate multiple of the @xmath70 component of the perturbed induction equation .",
    "the constraint reads :      our integration domain occupies only the first quadrant , since we take advantage of the symmetries at the equatorial plane .",
    "our numerical grid typically has @xmath85 points in @xmath86 , where @xmath27 varies in @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath68 in @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "we take usually 10.000 - 50.000 time steps in the evolution of the equations , depending on the rotating rate and , consequently , the frequency of the r - mode . in each time evolution",
    "we observe at least several periods of oscillation of the perturbations .",
    "we point out here that our time evolutions were so far stable , and we did not see signs of the hydromagnetic instability observed in @xcite for axial - led perturbations in newtonian gravity .",
    "the investigation of this issue in our relativistic treatment is left for a future work .",
    "we limited the maximum rotation rate considered here by @xmath89 , motivated by the results of @xcite , where they see corrections of the order @xmath90 in the r - mode frequencies for @xmath91 .",
    "we also limited our minimum rotation rate at @xmath92 because of numerical reasons , as already stated in the introduction ( lower rotation rates would demand longer simulations ) . in the next section",
    "we discuss the numerical limits on the magnetic field .",
    "the final equations obtained via the linear combinations and redefinitions of variables can be found in the appendix [ a1 ] . in appendix",
    "[ a2 ] we present simplified equations obtained from the equations in appendix [ a1 ] by neglecting the coefficients of the order @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "these simplified equations can be useful for sufficiently weak magnetic fields and sufficiently slow rotation rates , where neglecting the @xmath93 and @xmath94 terms could be justified .",

    "we solve the system of equations with a 2d lax - wendroff scheme with non - constant coefficients @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to a previous work @xcite for further details on the numerical setup used for obtaining the r - mode frequency and eigenfunction .",
    "( in @xcite it was used for non - magnetized and differentially rotating stars . )",
    "we calculated the r - modes first for zero magnetic field .",
    "the dependence of the r - mode frequencies on the rotation parameter for the non - magnetized field case is shown in figure [ fig : rmode0 ] .",
    "we compared results with @xcite for the star with @xmath96 , and found that our results match with less than 3% error .",

    "the approximation of the simplified equations is shown to break down in this case at the value of magnetic field around @xmath97 g , while the results obtained from the full equations _ seem _ to breakup at a larger magnetic field around @xmath98 g. for larger magnetic fields than @xmath99 g ( where we do not entirely trust our results ) , we still see that the r - mode disappears completely due to the growth of another mode ( possibly an alfvn mode ) .",
    "we believe that the breakdown in the behavior of the r - mode frequencies is caused by the growth of this other mode and the subsequent deformation of the r - mode .",
    "this is consistent with the expectations based on the results of @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in the figure [ fig : rmode2 ] , the r - mode frequencies change very little when one turns on the magnetic field .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of @xcite for newtonian stars .",
    "the change of the frequencies is more pronounced for smaller values of the rotation parameter . for @xmath100 and magnetic field @xmath101",
    "g , the r - mode frequency changes by a little less than 4% . in case of larger rotation",
    "@xmath102 the same value of magnetic field changes the r - mode frequency by 1% .    even though the variations are small , one can still clearly observe from fig.[fig : rmode2 ] the behavior of the frequencies with respect to the increasing magnetic field . such a behavior seems to have remarkable features : the r - mode frequencies behave for sufficiently large @xmath20 ( @xmath103 ) as @xmath104 , whereas for a smaller value of @xmath20 , ( @xmath105 ) , the behavior of the frequencies with respect to the magnetic field is given as @xmath106 .",
    "let us note that the @xmath106 dependence was observed for the r - modes of the spherical shell in @xcite .    in figures",
    "and we show the plots of the r - mode eigenfunctions for all the variables .",

    "the r - mode instability growth times ( for @xmath95 ) are calculated by using the usual quadrupole formula ( for the details see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic timescale is calculated from the equation : @xmath108 with @xmath109 ,  @xmath59 .",
    "the energy time derivative is calculated from the quadrupole formula as : @xmath110 with @xmath111^{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the mass and the current multipoles defined as in @xcite .",
    "( we use both mass and current multipoles , but because the r - modes involve only a perturbed velocity field , to the lowest order in @xmath20 , gravitational radiation through current multipoles dominates over that produced by mass multipoles @xcite . ) in particular the multipoles can be expressed as : @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( here @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the multipoles defined in @xcite . )",
    "we were able to fit the function @xmath1 for zero magnetic fields as a functions of the rotation period @xmath118 as @xmath119 with the dimensionless parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 taking the values  @xmath122   and  @xmath123 .",

    "we are comparing our results with @xcite where the calculations were done for the newtonian polytropes with stellar parameters close to ours .",
    "we obtained 27 - 34 % faster emission of gravitational waves compared to the newtonian setting . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         the instability growth time scale @xmath1 relative change due to the magnetic field is shown in figure .",
    "we can see that the relative change becomes positive for lower values of magnetic fields ( increasing the growth time and slowing down the emission of gravitational waves ) and then becomes negative for larger values of the magnetic field ( with the opposite effect ) , causing a relative change of up to @xmath3 5% .",
    "similarly to the r - mode frequencies , the relative effect of the magnetic field is more pronounced for the lower rotation rates . however , to estimate the amount of gravitational waves emitted and the window of the instability we would need to calculate the viscosity damping rates and that is left for future work .",
    "we presented here a model for a rotating magnetized star , in which we neglect the distortion of both the geometry and the fluid by a _ dipolar _ magnetic field .",
    "we derived the full perturbation equations in the cowling approximation . after solving the 2d time evolution problem with a lax - wendroff method , we computed the r - mode frequencies using the fourier spectrum of the solution and we were able to extract the eigenfunctions of the perturbations . the frequencies and eigenfunctions of the r - mode",
    "were then used to calculate the growth time scale due to gravitational radiation , using the newtonian quadrupole formalism .",
    "we found that the effect of the magnetic field on the frequencies is very small , ( up to 5% for the lowest rotation rates ) . for lower rotation rates the frequencies follow a @xmath124 dependence and , for higher rotation rates , a @xmath125 dependence .",
    "the effect on the r - mode growth time @xmath1 indicates a faster emission of gravitational waves , compared to the newtonian non - magnetized calculations of @xcite .",
    "we found that @xmath1 is more significantly affected by the presence of general relativity ( @xmath126% ) and less significantly by the presence of magnetic field ( up to @xmath127% ) .",
    "our results indicate that the relative effects of the magnetic field are more pronounced for more slowly rotating stars",
    ". therefore it could be possible that they achieve higher values for magnetars , that have rotation periods about 1000 times larger than the ones considered here ( due to numerical limitations ) .",
    "however , it is not trivial to estimate how large these corrections would be , given the complicated dependence on both rotation and magnetic field of the solutions .",
    "the effect of viscosity will play of course a key role in determining the actual instability window and is left for the future work .",
    "a more realistic description of the star would also need to include work with realistic equations of state and a stellar crust , together with considering the backreaction from the production of toroidal magnetic field @xcite .",
