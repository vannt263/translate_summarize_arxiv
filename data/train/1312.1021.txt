    "experiment@xcite indeed shows an opposite field dependence for such systems with pd and pt n - layers . that the sign of the electric field contribution to the pma reflects the n - layer whereas the field is applied to the opposite surface between f and i supports the current rashba model",
    "this is in stark contrast with the popular surface doping model@xcite , for which the effects of surface doping are limited by the ( possibly magnetically modified ) fermi - thomas screening length . in reality@xcite ,",

    "@xmath24 , the required asymmetry might be controlled in nfn tri - layers by varying in a systematic manner , at the mono - layer level , the thickness of one of the normal metal layers and by using metals with different spin - orbit couplings .",
    "in reality the effect of the substrate transmitted to , and through , the bottom normal metal will imply an asymmetry even for large n - layer thickness .",
    "indeed the pma surface term for au / fe(110)/au(111 ) structures does show an non - monotonic dependence on the top au layer thickness@xcite .",
    "experiments@xcite for fe layers on vicinal ag(001 ) and au(001 ) surfaces and which undergo a symmetry breaking ( 5@xmath7920 ) surface reconstruction manifest an in - plane surface term reflecting this broken symmetry and which is larger for au , with its stronger spin - orbit coupling , than for ag .",
    "it is predicted that the surface coercivity field @xmath80 is proportional to @xmath81 where @xmath2 is the internal electric field corresponding to the zero - bias rashba contribution to the anisotropy .",
    "such a non - linear field dependence is observed , e.g. , for the in - plane contribution for a ( ge , mn)as",
    "/ zro@xmath82 surface@xcite .",
    "in other experiments@xcite with cofeb / mgo / cofeb structures there is qualitative difference between the @xmath24 dependence of the anisotropy field @xmath80 of the , `` top '' and `` bottom '' , cofeb layers of this three layer structure , even when they have similar thicknesses .",
    "the bottom layer has a larger @xmath80 and is roughly linear while @xmath80 becomes highly non - linear as @xmath83 as would be expected as @xmath84 .",
    "the most direct experimental test of the model is the observation of the band splittings for a model rashba system with a variable contact with an itinerant ferromagnet .",
    "this can result in giant magnetic anisotropy ( gma ) energies .",
    "for example a @xmath85mev ( or @xmath86 t ) is reported in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements@xcite on bulk bitei . for a thin film of this , or similar material , in contact with an itinerant ferromagnet such as fe , a suitable exchange splitting @xmath87 , tuned to the order of @xmath48 , might be induced and a gma will result . arpes performed as a function of the direction of the magnetisation @xmath88 might determine both @xmath48 and the momentum dependence of the exchange splitting leading to estimates of both the pm and dm contributions and which might be directly compared with magnetisation and magnetic resonance measurements .",
    "the electrical control of such a gma has evident important application for non - volatile memory applications .",
    "there are clearly many more complicated embodiments of such a device .    in conclusion",
    ", it is suggested that the rashba magnetic field due to the internal electric field in the surface region of an ultra - thin ferromagnet can make an important contribution to the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy .",
    "such surface fields might be modified by application of an applied electric field .",
    "since the internal fields at two surfaces tend to cancel , an asymmetry between the surfaces is important .",
    "such an asymmetry is caused by different metal and insulator caping layers .",
