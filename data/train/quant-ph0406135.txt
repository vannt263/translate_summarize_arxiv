    "given the extensive use of quantum entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing @xcite , the theory of entanglement , in particular , entanglement quantification , is a topic important to quantum information theory .",
    "however , apart from a limited number of cases like low dimension hilbert spaces and for pure states , the mathematical structure of entanglement is not yet fully understood .",
    "the entanglement properties of bipartite states have been widely explored ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "this has been aided by the fact that bipartite states possess the nice mathematical property in the form of the schmidt decomposition @xcite , the schmidt coefficients encompassing all their non - local properties .",
    "no such simplifying structure is known in the case of larger systems .",
    "approaches using certain generalizations of schmidt decomposition @xcite and group theoretic or algebraic methods @xcite , have been taken in this direction .",
    "a number of methods for comparing or quantifying or qualifying entanglement have been proposed for bipartite systems and/or pure states such as entanglement of formation @xcite , entanglement cost @xcite , distillable entanglement @xcite , relative entropy of entanglement @xcite , negativity @xcite , concurrence @xcite and entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "however , these quantifications do not always lend themselves to being computed , except in some restricted situations . as such",
    ", a general formulation is still an open problem .",
    "it is known that state transformations under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) are very important to quantifying entanglement because locc can at the best increase only classical correlations .",
    "therefore a good measure of entanglement is expected not to increase under locc . a necessary and sufficient condition for the possibility of such transformations in the case of bipartite states",
    "was given by nielsen @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of his result was the existence of _ incomparable _ states ( the states that can not be obtained by locc from one another ) .",
    "bennett et al .",
    "@xcite , formalized the notions of reducibility , equivalence and incomparability to multi - partite states and gave a sufficient condition for incomparability based on _ partial _ entropic criteria .    in this work ,",
    "our principal aim is not to quantify entanglement , but to develop graph theoretic techniques to analyze the comparability of maximally entangled multipartite states of several qubits distributed between a number of different parties .",
    "we obtain various qualitative results concerning reversibility of operations and comparability of states by observing the combinatorics of multiparitite entanglement . for our purpose , it is sufficient to consider the graph theoretic representation of various maximally entangled states ( represented by specific graphs built from epr , ghz and so on ) .",
    "although this might at first seem overly restrictive , we will in fact be able to demonstrate a number of new results .",
    "furthermore , being based only on the monotonicity principle , it can be adapted to any specific quantification of entanglement .",
    "therefore , our approach is quite generic , in principle applicable to all entanglement measures . since the entanglement of maximally entangled states is usually represented by integer values , it turns out that we can analyze entangled systems simply by studying the combinatorial properties of graphs and set systems representing the states .",
    "the basic definitions and concepts are introduced through the framework set in section [ framework ] .",
    "we introduce a technique called _ bicolored merging _ in section [ bicoloredmerging ] , which is essentially a combinatorial way of quantifying maximal entanglment between two parts of the system , and inferring transformation properties to be satisfied by the states .",
    "in section [ skpsel ] , we present our first result : the impossibility of obtaining two einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs among three players starting from a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state ( theorem [ skpghzreverse ] ) .",
    "we then show that this can be used to establish the impossibility of implementing a two - pronged teleportation ( called _ selective teleportation _ ) given pre - shared entanglement in the form of a ghz state .",
    "we then demonstrate various classes of incomparable multi - partite states in section [ classmulentan ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the minimum number of copies of a state required to prepare another state by locc and present bounds on this number in terms of the _ quantum distance _ between the two states in section [ quantumdistance ] .",
    "we believe that our combinatorial approach vastly simplifies the study of entanglement in very complex systems .",
    "moreover , it opens up the road for further analysis , for example , to interpret entanglement topologically . in future works",
    ", we intend to apply and extend these insights to non - maximal and mixed multipartite states , and to combine our approach with a suitable measure of entanglement .",
    "in this section we introduce a number of basic concepts useful to describe combinatorics of entanglement .",
    "first , an _ epr graph _",
    "@xmath1 is a graph whose vertices are the players ( @xmath2 ) and edges ( @xmath3 ) represent shared entanglement in the form of an epr pair .",
    "formally :    epr graph : for @xmath0 agents @xmath4 an undirected graph @xmath5 is constructed as follows : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the graph @xmath9 thus formed is called the epr graph of the @xmath0 agents .",
    "a spanning tree is a graph which connects all vertices without forming cycles ( i.e. , loops ) . accordingly :    spanning epr tree : a _ spanning tree _ is a connected , undirected graph linking all vertices without forming cycles .",
    "an epr graph @xmath9 is called a _ spanning epr tree _ if the undirected graph @xmath10 is a spanning tree .",
    "the above notions are generalized to more general multipartite entanglement by means of the concept of a _ hypergraph_. a usual graph",
    "is built up from edges , where a normal edge links precisely two vertices .",
    "a hyperedge is a generalization that links @xmath11 vertices , where @xmath12 .",
    "a graph endowed with at least one hyperedge is called a hypergraph . from the combinatorial viewpoint",
    ", a simple and interesting connection can be made between entanglement and hyperedges : an @xmath0-cat state ( also sometimes called an @xmath0-ghz state ) corresponds to a hyperedge of size @xmath0 . in particular",
    ", an epr state corresponds to a simple edge connecting only two vertices .",
    "formally :    entangled hypergraph : let @xmath13 be the set of @xmath0 agents and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is such that its elements ( agents ) are in @xmath17-cat state .",
    "the hypergraph ( set system ) @xmath18 is called an entangled hypergraph of the @xmath0 agents .",
    "a graph is connected if there is a path ( having a length of one or more edges ) between any two vertices . accordingly :    connected entangled hypergraph : a sequence of @xmath19 hyperedges @xmath20 , @xmath21 , ... , @xmath22 in a hypergraph @xmath23 is called a _ hyperpath _ ( path ) from a vertex @xmath24 to a vertex @xmath25 if    1 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath26 have a common vertex for all @xmath27 , 2 .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are agents in @xmath13 , 3 .",
    "@xmath28 , and 4 .",
    "@xmath29 .",
    "if there is a hyperpath between every pair of vertices of @xmath13 in the hypergraph @xmath30 , we say that @xmath30 is connected .",
    "analogous to a spanning epr tree we have :    entangled hypertree : a connected entangled hypergraph @xmath31 is called an entangled hypertree if it contains no cycles , that is , there do not exist any pair of vertices from @xmath13 such that there are two distinct paths between them .",
    "further :    @xmath11-uniform entangled hypertree : an entangled hypertree is called an @xmath11-uniform entangled hypertree if all of its hyperedges are of size @xmath11 for @xmath32 .    in ordinary graphs , a vertex that terminates , i.e. , has precisely a single edge linked to it is called a terminal or pendent vertex .",
    "this concept is extended to the case of hypergraphs :    pendant vertex : a vertex of a hypergraph @xmath23 such that it belongs to only one hyperedge of @xmath33 is called a pendant vertex in @xmath30 .",
    "vertices which belong to more than one hyperedge of @xmath30 are called non - pendant .    in the paper",
    "we use polygons for pictorially representing an entangled hypergraph of multipartite states .",
    "( there should be no confusion with a closed loop of epr pairs because we consider only tree structured states ) .",
    "a hyperedge representing an @xmath0-cat amongst the parties @xmath34 is pictorially represented by an @xmath0-gon with vertices distinctly numbered by @xmath35 .",
    "we write these vertices @xmath36 corresponding to the @xmath0 vertices of the @xmath0-gon in the pictorial representation in arbitrary order .",
    "this only means that out of @xmath0 qubits of the @xmath0-cat , one qubit is with each of the @xmath0 parties .",
    "a result we will require frequently is that there exist teleportation @xcite protocols to produce @xmath0-partite entanglement starting from pairwise entanglement shared along any spanning tree connecting the @xmath0 parties .",
    "that is , there exist locc protocols to turn a @xmath0-party spanning epr tree into an @xmath0-regular hypergraph consisting of a single hyperedge of size @xmath0 .",
    "the protocol is detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the basic idea is readily described .",
    "it is essentially a scheme to deterministically create a maximally entangled @xmath0-cat state from @xmath37 epr pairs shared along a spanning tree .",
    "briefly , the protocol consists in teleporting entanglement along a spanning tree .",
    "players not on terminal vertices along the tree execute the following subroutine",
    ". suppose player alice shares an @xmath38-cat with @xmath39 preceding players along the tree and wishes to create an @xmath40-cat state including bob , the next player down the tree .",
    "first she entangles an auxiliary particle with her particle in the @xmath38-cat state by means of local operation .",
    "she then uses her epr pair shared with bob to teleport the state of the auxiliary particle to bob .",
    "the @xmath40 players , including alice and bob , now share an @xmath40-cat state , as desired .",
    "another result we will require in some of our proofs , given as the theorem below , is that the spanning epr tree mentioned above is also a necessary condition to prepare an @xmath0-cat state starting from shared epr pairs .",
    "[ skpnec ] given a communication network of @xmath0 agents with only epr pairs permitted for pairwise entanglement between agents , a necessary condition for creation of a @xmath0-cat state is that the epr graph of the @xmath0 agents must be connected .",
    "proof of the theorem is given in appendix 1 using our method of bicolored merging developed in section iii .",
    "monotonicity is easily the most natural characteristic that ought to be satisfied by all entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "it requires that any appropriate measure of entanglement must not change under local unitary operations and more generally , the expected entanglement must not increase under locc .",
    "we should note here that in locc , lo involves unitary transformations , additions of ancillas ( that is , enlarging the hilbert space ) , measurements , and throwing away parts of the system , each of these actions performed by one party on his or her subsystem .",
    "cc between the parties allows local actions by one party to be conditioned on the outcomes of the earlier measurements performed by the other parties .",
    "apart from monotonicity , there are certain other characteristics required to be satisfied by entanglement measures .",
    "however , monotonicity itself vastly restricts the choice of entanglement measures ( for example , marginal entropy as a measure of entanglement for bipartite pure states or entanglement of formation for mixed states ) . in the present work",
    ", we find that monotonicity , where proven for a particular entanglement measure candidate , restricts a large number of state transformations and gives rise to several classes of incomparable ( multi - partite ) states .",
    "so , in order to study the possible state transformations of ( multi - partite ) states under locc , it would be interesting to look at the kind of state transforms under locc which monotonicity does not allow .",
    "we can observe that monotonicity does not allow the preparation of @xmath41 or more epr pairs between two parties starting from only @xmath0 epr pairs between them .",
    "in particular , it is not possible to prepare two or more epr pairs between two parties starting only with a single epr pair and only locc .",
    "this is an example of impossible state transformation in bipartite case as dictated by the monotonicity postulate .",
    "we anticipate that a large class of multi - partite states could also be shown to be incomparable by using impossibility results for the bipartite case through suitable reductions .",
    "for instance , consider transforming ( under locc ) the state represented by a spanning epr tree , say @xmath42 , to that of the state represented by another spanning epr tree , say @xmath43 ( see figure [ figure30a ] ) .",
    "this transformation can be shown to be impossible by reducing to the bipartite case as follows : we assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a protocol @xmath44 which can perform the required transformation .",
    "it is easy to see that the protocol @xmath44 is also applicable in the case when a party @xmath45 possesses all the qubits of parties @xmath46 and @xmath47 and another party @xmath48 possesses all the qubits of the parties @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this means that party @xmath45 is playing the role of parties @xmath51 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 is playing the role of parties @xmath52 and @xmath50 . clearly , any locc actions done within group @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is a subset of lo available to @xmath48 ( @xmath45 ) and any cc done between one party from @xmath53 and the other from @xmath54 is managed by cc between @xmath48 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , starting only with one edge ( @xmath55 ) they eventually construct @xmath42 just by lo ( by local creation of epr pairs representing the edges @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 by @xmath48 and @xmath59 by @xmath45 ) .",
    "they then apply protocol @xmath44 to obtain @xmath43 with the edges @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "( refer to the figure [ figure30c ] ) .",
    "all edges except @xmath62 and @xmath63 are local epr pairs ( that is , both qubits are with the same party , @xmath45 or @xmath48 ) . now the parties @xmath45 and @xmath48 share two epr pairs in the form of the edges @xmath62 and @xmath63 , even though they started sharing only one epr pair . but",
    "this is in contradiction with monotonicity : that expected entanglement should not increase under locc .",
    "hence , we can conclude that such a protocol @xmath44 can not exist !",
    "the approach we took in the above example could also be motivated from the marginal entropic criterion ( noting that this criterion in essence is also a direct implication of monotonicity ) .",
    "as clear from the above example , the above scheme aims to create a bipartition among the @xmath0 players in such a way that the marginal entropy of each partition is different for the two states . in many cases , this difference will simply correspond to different number of epr pairs shared between the two partitions .",
    "given two multi - partite states , the relevant question is :  is there a bipartition such that the marginal entropy for the two states is different ? \" .",
    "if yes , then the state ( configuration of entanglement ) corresponding to the higher entropy can not be obtained from that to lower entropy by means of locc .",
    "it is convenient to imagine the two partitions being ` colored ' distinctly to identify the partitions which they make up .    in general ,",
    "suppose we want to show that the multi - partite state @xmath64 can not be converted to the multi - partite state @xmath65 by locc .",
    "this can be done by showing an assignment of the qubits ( of all parties ) to only two parties such that @xmath64 can be obtained from @xmath0 ( @xmath66 ) epr pairs between the two parties by locc while @xmath65 can be converted to more than @xmath0 epr pairs between the two parties by locc .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that each party is given either of two colors ( say @xmath45 or @xmath48 ) .",
    "finally all qubits with parties colored with color @xmath45 are assigned to the first party ( say @xmath45 ) and that with parties colored with second color to the second party ( say @xmath48 ) .",
    "this coloring is done in such a way that the state @xmath64 can be obtained by locc from less number of epr pairs between @xmath45 and @xmath48 than that can be obtained from @xmath65 by locc . local preparation",
    "( or throwing away ) of epr pairs is what we call merging in combinatorial sense .",
    "keeping this idea in mind , we now formally introduce the idea of bicolored merging for such reductions in the case of the multi - partite states represented by epr graphs and entangled hypergraphs .",
    "suppose that there are two epr graphs @xmath67 and @xmath68 on the same vertex set @xmath69 ( this means that these two multi - partite states are shared amongst the same set of parties ) and we want to show the impossibility of transforming @xmath70 to @xmath71 under locc , then this is reduced to a bipartite locc transformation which violates monotonicity , as follows :    1 .",
    "bicoloring : assign either of the two colors @xmath45 or @xmath48 to every vertex , that is , each element of @xmath69 .",
    "2 .   merging : for each element @xmath72 of @xmath20 , merge the two vertices @xmath73 and @xmath74 if and only if they have been assigned the same color during the bicoloring stage and assign the same color to the merged vertex .",
    "call this graph obtained from @xmath70 as bcm ( bicolored - merged ) epr graph of @xmath70 and denote it by @xmath75 .",
    "similarily , obtain the bcm epr graph @xmath76 of @xmath71 .",
    "the bicoloring and merging is done in such a way that the graph @xmath76 has more number of edges than that of @xmath75 .",
    "4 .   give all the qubits possessed by the vertices with color @xmath45 to the first party ( say , party @xmath45 ) and all the qubits possessed by the vertices with color @xmath48 to the second party ( say , party @xmath48 ) . combining this with the previous steps",
    ", it is ensured that in the bipartite reduction of the multi - partite state represented by @xmath71 , the two parties @xmath45 and @xmath48 share more number of epr pairs ( say , state @xmath77 ) than that for @xmath70 ( say , state @xmath78 ) .",
    "we denote this reduction as @xmath79 .",
    "now if there exits a protocol @xmath44 which can transform @xmath70 to @xmath71 by locc , then @xmath44 can also transform @xmath78 to @xmath77 just by locc as follows : @xmath45 ( @xmath48 ) will play the role of all vertices in @xmath69 which were colored as @xmath45 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the edges which were removed due to merging can easily be cretated by local operations ( local preparation of epr pairs ) by the party @xmath45 ( @xmath48 ) if the color of the merged end - vertices of the edge was assigned color @xmath45 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this means that starting from @xmath78 and only lo , @xmath70 can be created .",
    "this graph is virtually amongst @xmath80 parties even though there are only two parties .",
    "the protocol @xmath44 then , can be applied to @xmath70 to obtain @xmath71 by locc .",
    "subsequently @xmath77 can be obtained by the necessary merging of vertices by lo , that is by throwing away the local epr pair represented by the edges between the vertices being merged .",
    "since the preparation of @xmath77 from @xmath78 by locc violates the monotonocity postulate , such a protocol @xmath44 can not exist !",
    "an example of bicolored merging for epr graphs has been illustrated in figure [ figure31 ] .",
    "the bicolored merging in the case of entangled hypergraphs is essentially the same as that for epr graphs . for the sake of completeness , we present it here .",
    "suppose there are two entangled hypergraphs @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath82 on the same vertex set @xmath13 ( that is , the two multi - partite states are shared amongst the same set of parties ) and we want to show the impossibility of transforming @xmath83 to @xmath84 under locc .",
    "transformation of @xmath83 to @xmath84 can be reduced to a bipartite locc transformation which violates monotonicity thus proving the impossibility .",
    "the reduction is done as follows :    1 .",
    "bicoloring : assign either of the two colors @xmath45 or @xmath48 to every vertex , that is , each element of @xmath13 .",
    "merging : for each element @xmath85 of @xmath86 , merge all vertices with color @xmath45 to one vertex and those with color @xmath48 to another vertex and give them colors @xmath45 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "this merging collapses each hyperedge to either a simple edge or a vertex and thus the hypergraph reduces to a simple graph with vertices assigned with either of the two colors @xmath45 or @xmath48 .",
    "call this graph obtained from @xmath83 as bcm epr graph of @xmath83 and denote it by @xmath87 .",
    "similarily obtain the bcm epr graph @xmath88 of @xmath84 .",
    "the bicoloring and merging is done in such a way that the graph @xmath88 has more number of edges than that of @xmath87 .",
    "4 .   give all the qubits possessed by the vertices with color @xmath45 to the party one ( say party @xmath45 ) and all the qubits possessed by the vertices with color @xmath48 to the second party ( say party @xmath48 ) .    we denote the above reduction as @xmath89 .",
    "the rest of the discussion is similar to that for the case of epr graphs given before . in the figure [ figure32 ] , we demostrate the bicolored merging of entangled hypergraphs .",
    "note that the two entangled hypergraphs @xmath83 and @xmath84 are locc comparable only if one of @xmath89 and @xmath90 is not true .",
    "equivalently , if both of @xmath89 and @xmath90 hold , then the entangled hypergraphs @xmath83 and @xmath84 are incomparable .",
    "it is also interesting to note at this point that locc incomparability shown by using the method of bicolored merging is in fact _",
    "strong incomparability _ as defined in @xcite",
    ". we would also like to stress that any kind of reduction ( in particular , various possible extensions of bicolored merging ) which leads to the violation of _ any _ of the properties of a potential entanglement measure , is pertinent to show the impossibility of many multi - partite state transformations under locc .",
    "since the bipartite case has been extensively studied , such reductions can potentially provide many ideas about multi - partite case by just exploiting the results from the bipartite case .",
    "in particular , the definitions of epr graphs and entangled hypergraphs could also be suitably extended to capture more types of multi - partite pure states and even mixed states and a generalization of the idea of bicolored merging as a suitable reduction for this case could also be worked out .",
    "we know that a ghz state amongst three agents @xmath45 , @xmath48 and @xmath91 can be prepared from epr pairs shared between any two pairs of the three agents using only locc @xcite .",
    "we consider the problem of _ reversing _ this operation , that is , whether it is possible to construct two epr pairs between any two pairs of the three agents from a ghz state amongst the three agents , using only locc . by using the method of bicolored merging",
    ", we answer this question in the negative by establishing the following theorem .",
    "[ skpghzreverse ] starting from a ghz state shared amongst three parties in a communication network , two epr pairs can not be created between any two sets of two parties using only locc .",
    "suppose there exists a protocol @xmath44 for _ reversing _ a ghz state into two epr pairs using only locc .",
    "in particular , suppose protocol @xmath44 starts with a ghz state amongst the agents @xmath45 , @xmath48 and @xmath91 , and prepares epr pairs between any two pairs of @xmath45 , @xmath48 and @xmath91 ( say , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , corresponding to configuration @xmath70 as shown in figure [ figure33 ] ) .",
    "since we can prepare the ghz state from epr pairs between any two pairs of the three agents , we can prepare the ghz state starting from epr pairs between @xmath45 and @xmath48 , and @xmath45 and @xmath91 .",
    "once the ghz state is prepared , we can apply protocol @xmath44 to construct epr pairs between @xmath45 and @xmath91 and between @xmath48 and @xmath91 using only locc ( i.e. , configuration @xmath94 ) .",
    "so , we can use only locc to convert a configuration where epr pairs exist between @xmath45 and @xmath91 and between @xmath45 and @xmath48 , to a configuration where epr pairs are shared between @xmath45 and @xmath91 and between @xmath48 and @xmath91 .",
    "the possibility of @xmath44 means that the marginal entropy of @xmath91 can be increased using only locc , which is known to be impossible .    the same result",
    "could also be achieved by similar bicolored merging directly applied on the ghz state and any of @xmath70 or @xmath71 but we prefer the above proof for stressing the argument on the symmetry of @xmath70 and @xmath71 with respect to the ghz . moreover",
    ", this proof gives an intuition about possibility of incomparability amongst spanning epr trees as @xmath70 and @xmath71 are two distinct spanning epr trees on three vertices .",
    "we prove this general result in the theorem [ twoeprtrees ] .",
    "the above theorem motivates us to propose some kind of comparison between a ghz state and two pairs of epr pairs in terms of the non - local correlations they possess . in this sense , therefore , a ghz state may be viewed as less than two epr pairs .",
    "it is easy to see that an epr pair between any two parties can be obtained starting only from a ghz state shared amongst the three parties and locc .",
    "the third party will just do a measurement in the diagonal basis and send the result to other two . by applying the corresponding suitable operations they get the required epr pair .",
    "> from theorem [ skpnec ] , we observe that a single epr pair , between any two of the three parties , is not sufficient for preparing a ghz state amongst the three parties using only locc .",
    "these arguments can be summarised in the following theorem .",

    "now @xmath45 takes four qubits ; she prepares two epr pairs one from the first and second qubits and the other from the third and fourth qubits .",

    "moreover , from theorem [ skpnec ] ( see appendix 1 for proof ) , no disconnected epr graph would be able to yield @xmath0-cat just by locc .",
    "these two observations combined together lead to the following theorem which signifies the fact that these two multi - partite states can not be compared .    [ catgraph ] a cat state amongst @xmath0 agents in a communication network is locc incomparable to any disconnected epr graph associated with the @xmath0 agents having more than one edge .",
    "the above result indicates that there are many possible forms of entanglement structures ( multi - partite states ) which can not be compared at all in terms of non - local correlations they may have .",
    "this simple result is just an implication of the necessary combinatorics required for the preparation of cat states .",
    "one more interesting question with respect to this combinatorics is to compare a spanning epr tree and a cat state .",
    "a spanning epr tree is combinatorially sufficient for preparing the cat state and thus seems to entail more non - local correlations than in a cat state .",
    "the question whether this ordering is strict needs to be further investigated .",
    "it is easy to see that an epr pair between any two parites can be obtained starting from a cat state shared amongst the @xmath0 agents just by locc ( theorem [ catepr ] ) .",
    "therefore , given @xmath37 copies of the cat state we can build all the @xmath37 edges of any spanning epr tree just by locc .",
    "but whether this is the lower bound on the number of copies of @xmath0-cat required to obtain an spanning epr tree is even more interesting .",
    "the following theorem shows that this is indeed the lower bound .",
    "[ treecat ] starting with only @xmath105 copies of @xmath0-cat state shared amongst its @xmath0 agents , no spanning epr tree of the @xmath0 agents can be obtained just by locc .",
    "suppose it is possible to create a spanning epr tree @xmath106 from @xmath107 copies of @xmath0-cat states .",
    "as we know , an @xmath0-cat state can be prepared from any spanning epr tree by locc @xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath107 copies of @xmath0-cat can be converted to @xmath106 , then @xmath107 copies of any spanning epr tree can be converted to @xmath106 just by locc . in particular , @xmath107 copies of a chain epr graph ( which is clearly a spanning epr tree , figure [ figure36 ] ) can be converted to @xmath106 just by locc .",
    "now , we know that any tree is a bipartite connected graph with @xmath37 edges across the two parts .",
    "let vertices @xmath108 be the members of the first group and the rest be in the other group . construct a chain epr graph where the first @xmath38 vertices are @xmath109 in the sequence , and the rest of the vertices are from the other group in the sequence ( figure [ figure36 ] ) . in bicolored merging",

    "* proof of theorem [ skpnec ] * : + we use the method of bicolored merging to prove the fact that any disconnected epr graph @xmath267 on @xmath0-vertices can not be converted to an @xmath0-cat state on those vertices under locc .",
    "we first note that the bcm epr graph of an @xmath0-cat state , irrespective of the bicoloring done , is always a graph which contains exactly one edge .",
    "now as @xmath267 is disconnected it will have more than one connected components .",
    "let these components be @xmath268 , where @xmath269 .",
    "the bicoloring is done as follows : assign the color @xmath45 to all the vertices in the component @xmath270 and the color @xmath48 to all other vertices i.e. all vertices in @xmath271 . after merging",
    ", therefore , @xmath267 reduces to a disconnected graph with no edges i.e. the bcm epr graph of @xmath267 is a graph with @xmath272 isolated vertices and no edges .",
    "now if we are able to prepare an @xmath0-cat state from @xmath267 just using locc , we could also prepare an epr pair between two parties who were never sharing an epr pair just using locc .",
    "this violates monotonicity and hence the theorem is proved .",
    "proof of the claim : we first show that on the same vertex set , the number of hyperedges in any @xmath11-uniform hypertree is always same .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath38 be the number of vertices and hyperedges in a @xmath11-uniform hypertree .",
    "we show by induction on @xmath38 that @xmath276 .",
    "now take a @xmath11-uniform hypertree with @xmath38 hyperedges . remove any of the hyperedges to get another hypergraph ( which may not be connected ) having only @xmath279 edges .",
    "this removal may introduce @xmath272 connected components ( sub - hypertrees ) ; @xmath280 .",
    "let these components have respectively @xmath281 number of hyperedges .",
    "therefore , @xmath282 .",
    "the total number of vertices in the new hypergraph ( with the @xmath272 sub - hypertrees as components ) , @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the number of vertices in the component @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , @xmath285 ( under induction assumption ) .",
    "now the number of vertices in the original hypertree , @xmath286 because @xmath272 vertices were already covered , one each in the @xmath272 components .",
    "therefore , @xmath287 .",
    "the result is thus true for @xmath38 and hence for any number of hyperedges by induction .",
    "this result implies that any @xmath11-uniform hypertree on the same vertex set will always have the same number of hyperedges .",
    "take any vertex say @xmath292 .",
    "since @xmath293 and @xmath83 is a hypertree therefore connected , @xmath214 can not be an isolated vertex and therefore @xmath294 such that @xmath295 .",
