    "there is growing evidence from x - ray observations and numerical simulations that bulk of the baryons in the universe resides in groups and clusters of galaxies , seen as diffuse ionized gas ( e.g. fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "the hot gas interacts the passing cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons through the so - called sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , depending uniquely on the total thermal energy of the gas contained in the system .",
    "consequently , the effect is not only independent of the redshift of the system but also insensitive to detailed structure of the gas distribution .",
    "therefore , it is well suited for studies of distant groups and clusters and their cosmic evolution .",
    "motivated by these advantages , the purely sz - based sky surveys have been proposed ( bartlett & silk 1994 ; barbosa et al . 1996 ) and several dedicated interferometric arrays for non - targeted sz surveys are under construction ( e.g. kneissl 2000 ; holder et al .",
    "2000 ; udomprasert , mason & readhead 2000 ; fan & chiueh 2001 ) .",
    "it has been realized that non - targeted sz surveys can act as a sensitive probe of the cosmological parameters via the sz counts and in particular their redshift distribution ( barbosa et al .",
    "1996 ) . both numerical simulations ( e.g. holder et al .",
    "2000 ; seljak , burwell & pen 2000 ; springel , white & hernquist 2000 ) and analytic treatment ( e.g. bartlett 2000 ; fan & chiueh 2001 ) have been developed in recent years towards the demonstration of how remarkably one can set tight constraints on the cosmic density parameter @xmath5 , the cosmological constant @xmath6 and the normalization parameter @xmath7 using the forthcoming sz surveys . essentially , all these predictions are based on the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function ( mf ) ( press & schechter 1974 ) , together with the mass - temperature relation and a constant gas fraction which convert the gas temperature and mass in the sz effect into the dark halo mass in the ps formalism . while the ps formalism and the mass - temperature relation have been justified by numerous optical / x - ray observations and in particular by numerical simulations on broad mass scales from groups to rich clusters , the robustness of our predictions for sz source counts based purely on these theoretically motivated mechanisms should be further tested .",
    "recall that sz surveys provide no direct information about the distribution and evolution of dark halos in the universe .",
    "whenever the gas is involved , we should worry about the contamination of other non - gravitational heating processes , the possible departure of the gas from hydrostatic equilibrium , and the different evolution scenario of the gas from that of the dark halos .",
    "therefore , it is worthy of exploring an independent estimate of sz counts based more closely on the well - established observational facts , and comparing it with the result from the above standard theoretical model .",
    "this permits an examination of the reliability / uncertainty of the theoretically expected sz counts and their cosmological applications .    in this paper , we calculate the expectations for sz surveys of clusters using the observationally determined cluster x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) and x - ray luminosity(@xmath0)-temperature(@xmath1 ) relation instead of the standard ps formalism .",
    "our strategy is to utilize as far as possible our current knowledge of x - ray clusters in the prediction of sz cluster counts .",
    "we wish to compare our prediction on the basis of observational facts with that from the theoretical ps formalism .",
    "in fact , there is noticeable difference in the working hypotheses between the two scenarios : first , the cluster xlf exhibits no or only mild evolution at least out to @xmath8 , while the mf of dark halos represented by the ps formalism is sensitive to redshift unless an open cosmological model or a nonzero cosmological constant is properly introduced ; second , the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for clusters ( @xmath9 ) deviates remarkably from the simply scaling law ( @xmath10 ) expected from self - similar evolution of both dark matter and intracluster gas with cosmic epoch , which compares with the well established mass - temperature relation ( @xmath11 ) adopted in the standard ps approach . in a sense , the employment of the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 relation permits the inclusion of other non - gravitational heating in the prediction of sz cluster counts , although the effect may be minor for rich clusters .",
    "alternatively , we note that the x - ray cluster counts can be reproduced remarkably well within the framework of the ps formalism via the cluster @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ( kitayama & suto 1997 ) .",
    "it remains interesting to examine the issue of whether the ps formalism and the cluster xlf via the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation can predict the same sz cluster counts .",
    "we begin with a brief summary of the procedure of evaluating the total sz flux for a given cluster at redshift @xmath12 ( see also barbosa et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the change in cmb intensity by thermal sz effect of hot intracluster gas is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath1 are the electron mass , density and temperature , respectively , and the integral is along the line - of - sight .",
    "the spectral dependence is represented by @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath18 , and @xmath19 k is the temperature of cmb .",
    "the total integrated sz flux over the cluster face is then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angular diameter distance to the cluster .",
    "if we assume that the gas is isothermal , then the above integral over the entire volume of a cluster can be replaced by the total gas mass of the cluster , @xmath22 . introducing the gas fraction @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total cluster mass , we have @xmath25    virial theorem suggests that the virial mass @xmath24 , virial radius @xmath26 and temperature @xmath1 of a cluster are scaled as @xmath27 . specifically , if we define @xmath26 as the radius within which the mean cluster density is @xmath28 times the critical density of the universe @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 , then the mass - temperature relation in terms of the notations of bryan & norman ( 1998 ) reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the hubble constant , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is a normalization factor in the range of @xmath36 .",
    "this relation has been well justified by both numerical simulations ( evrard , metzler & navarro 1996 ; bryan & norman 1998 ) and x - ray observations ( horner et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath0 emitted as thermal bremsstrahlung by the intracluster gas follows @xmath37 . in the self - similar model ( kaiser 1986 ) , this reduces to @xmath38 . in principle",
    ", the x - ray luminosity @xmath0 can be linked with the virial mass @xmath24 through equation ( 6 ) .",
    "however , there are primarily two reasons that we can not adopt this approach in our analysis below : firstly , unlike the @xmath24-@xmath1 relation discussed above , it remains unclear how to properly normalize the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ( see kitayama & suto 1997 ) . secondly , a number of observational tests of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation have revealed a steeper @xmath0-@xmath1 relation close to @xmath39 especially in poor clusters ( see wu , xue & fang 1999 for a recent summary ) , which deviates significantly from the theoretical argument @xmath10 , provided that the baryon fraction in clusters is universal .",
    "such a discrepancy is often interpreted as the contamination of non - gravitational heating processes in the early phase of formation and evolution of clusters ( e.g. cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1998 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 1998 ; ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 ) . if we confine ourselves to rich clusters as selected by the ongoing and upcoming sz surveys , the effect of non - gravitational heating is probably only minor .",
    "nonetheless , without loss of generality we adopt the following @xmath0-@xmath1 relation determined empirically from x - ray observations @xmath40 where the free parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be fixed in the fitting of x - ray data .",
    "now , the total sz flux equation ( 5 ) can be re - written as @xmath45 or @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the dimensionless part of @xmath21 : @xmath49 . replacing the gas temperature in equation ( 10 ) by the x - ray luminosity in term of equation ( 8)",
    ", we have @xmath50 these relations constitute a crucial link between the total sz flux in sz surveys and the cluster distribution characterized by mf or xlf .",
    "in the standard model , the ps formalism is adopted to describe the mf of clusters , which provides a reasonable scenario for the evolution of abundance of massive dark halos that grow from random - phase gaussian initial fluctuations : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean cosmic density , @xmath53 is the linear over - density of perturbations that collapsed and virialized at redshift @xmath12 , and @xmath54 is the linear theory variance of the mass density fluctuation in sphere of mass @xmath24 . multiplying this mf by the comoving volume element and integrating over masses greater than the limit @xmath55 set by the sz flux @xmath56 ( equation [ 9 ] ) yield the differential number of sz clusters : @xmath57 where the comoving volume element is @xmath58 the total sz cluster counts can be obtained by integrating the above expression over entire redshift space @xmath59    following viana & liddle ( 1999 )",
    ", we adopt the linear over - density threshold @xmath60 and the approximate expression for the variance of the fluctuation spectrum filtered on the comoving scale @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63,\\ ] ] and @xmath64 is the so - called shape parameter .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 is defined by @xmath66 }                { g[\\omega_{\\rm m},\\omega_{\\lambda}]},\\ ] ] in which the linear growth factor can be reasonably approximated by ( carroll , press & turner 1992 ) @xmath67}.\\ ] ] numerous studies have been devoted to the calibration of the present value @xmath7 using primarily cmb anisotropy measurements and cluster abundances .",
    "we adopt the result deduced by eke , cole & frenk ( 1996 ) based on the cluster temperature function @xmath68 another parameter is the overdensity of dark matter with respect to the critical density @xmath29 , @xmath28 , for which we take the approximate expression fitted by bryan & norman ( 1998 ) @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "this formula is accurate to within @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "the reliability of the theoretical prediction for sz cluster surveys from the cluster xlf depends on our current knowledge of the dynamical properties of intracluster gas and the cosmic evolution of the cluster xlf . over the past years",
    ", various surveys with rosat using different x - ray selection methods have yielded an unprecedented sampling of the xlf of local and distant clusters .",
    "essentially , the local xlf and the xlf at high redshifts out to @xmath73 are found to be in excellent agreement with each other , indicating that bulk of cluster population have experienced no significant evolution since @xmath8 ( e.g. ebeling et al .",
    "1997 ; collins et al . 1997 ; rosati et al .",
    "1998 ; burke et al . 1997 ; de grandi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , this does not exclude the possibility that the most luminous clusters ( typically @xmath74 @xmath75 kev@xmath76>5\\times10^{44}$ ] erg s@xmath3 ) may become rarer with increasing redshift , at least at @xmath77 ( rosati et al .",
    "so , we would like to adopt both non - evolving and evolving xlfs of clusters in our theoretical predictions of sz cluster surveys and compare their differences .",
    "the differential xlf of clusters can be modeled by the schechter function ( e.g. ebeling et al . 1997 ; rosati et al .",
    "2000 ; etc . )",
    "@xmath78 where the cosmic evolution is characterized by @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "( rosati et al . 2000 ) .",
    "for the non - evolving xlf , we adopt the local xlf constructed by ebeling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the 0.5 - 2 kev band : @xmath81 mpc@xmath82 ( @xmath83 ergs s@xmath3)@xmath84 , @xmath85 ergs s@xmath3 and @xmath86 , where the hubble constant is @xmath87 , and the errors are @xmath88 confidence limits . for the evolving xlf",
    ", we adopt the evolution parameters given by rosati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for an einstein - de - sitter universe : @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in order to convert the above xlf given in a flat cosmological model of @xmath91 and @xmath92 into the ones in arbitrary cosmological models , we demand that the observed number ( @xmath93 ) of clusters in a given redshift interval ( @xmath94 ) be conserved , namely , @xmath95 in which the quantities @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath0 with and without the subscript ` 0 ' correspond to the einstein - de - sitter universe ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) and other cosmological models , respectively .",
    "this enables us to express the cluster xlf in arbitrary cosmological models in terms of the xlf in the einstein - de - sitter universe : @xmath98 here x - ray luminosities in the two cosmological models are connected by @xmath99 ^ 2 l_{\\rm x,0},\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the corresponding luminosity distances . for nearby clusters , the luminosity distance @xmath100 and the comoving volume element @xmath96 are insensitive to the cosmological parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "so , the local xlf of the einstein - de - sitter universe remains roughly unchanged when scaled to arbitrary cosmological models .",
    "replacing the mf in equations ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) by the cluster xlf and integrating over x - ray luminosity give the differential and total number of clusters with sz flux greater than @xmath56 : @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively , where the lower limit @xmath104 is determined by equation ( 12 ) .",
    "finally , we come to the observationally determined @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for clusters . with the improvement of the accuracy in the determination of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations for local and distant clusters over the past two decades , it has been well established that the cluster @xmath0-@xmath1 relation exhibits no significant evolution at least out to @xmath105 ( e.g. mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; della ceca et al .",
    "2000 ; fairly et al .",
    "this sets @xmath106 in equation ( 8)",
    ". however , the observationally determined @xmath0-@xmath1 relation varies with the x - ray luminosity range : the best - fit @xmath0-@xmath1 relation becomes shallower for x - ray luminous clusters than for fainter ones , which is probably associated with non - gravitational heating .",
    "here we would like to work with two x - ray luminosity ranges : @xmath74 @xmath107 @xmath108 kev ] @xmath109 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath74 @xmath107 @xmath108 kev ] @xmath110 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the former corresponds roughly to the ongoing and upcoming sz cluster surveys ( e.g. grego et al .",
    "2000 ; udomprasert et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the latter may be useful for future sz poor cluster surveys .",
    "we determine the corresponding cluster @xmath0-@xmath1 relations in the 0.5 - 2.0 band using the non - exhausted catalog of x - ray clusters compiled by wu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and xue & wu ( 2000 ) .",
    "a total of 86 luminous ( @xmath111 ) and 162 luminous plus faint ( @xmath112 ) clusters whose measurement uncertainties in both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are available are used for this analysis .",
    "our best - fit @xmath0-@xmath1 relations in the 0.5 - 2 kev band are @xmath113 where @xmath0 is computed for a flat cosmological model of @xmath91 and @xmath87 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in units of @xmath83 erg s@xmath3 and kev , respectively , and the quoted errors are @xmath88 confidence limits .",
    "note that these relations are apparently shallower than the bolometric x - ray luminosity - temperature relation which reads @xmath114 for an ensemble of 162 clusters analyzed above .",
    "the similar tendency was noticed by markevitch ( 1998 ) for the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation in the 0.1 - 2.4 band . in principle , the best - fit @xmath0-@xmath1 relations in other cosmological models can be correspondingly obtained . here",
    "we d rather take a simple way to estimate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations for other cosmological models in terms of equation ( 26 ) .",
    "essentially , the ps formalism provides a good approximation of the mf for dark halos over entire mass ranges .",
    "the theoretically predicted sz counts based on equations ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) have therefore included the contribution of less massive virialized objects satisfying the sz flux limit @xmath56 ( equation [ 9 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we have set a lower x - ray luminosity limit ( @xmath111 or @xmath112 ) in the estimate of the sz cluster counts within the framework of the cluster xlf . in order to facilitate our comparison of the sz cluster counts between the two different scenarios , the mass thresholds in equations ( 14 ) and ( 16 )",
    "should be compatible with the x - ray luminosity thresholds in equations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) .",
    "this can be achieved by combining the @xmath24-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath1 relations , equations ( 6)-(8 ) .",
    "it appears that the resultant lower mass limit @xmath55 varies with cosmological model , the cluster @xmath0-@xmath1 relation and redshift . for examples , in the case of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath87 , the typical values of @xmath55 at @xmath115 set by @xmath116 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath117 erg s@xmath3 are @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "we adopt three cosmological models to perform our numerical computations : the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model , a low density , flat cdm model with a nonzero cosmological constant of @xmath6 ( @xmath120cdm ) and a low density , open cdm model ( ocdm ) , and their parameters are summarized in table 2 .",
    "in addition , the baryon fraction is assumed to be @xmath121 .",
    "we demonstrate our numerical results using a central frequency of @xmath122 ghz for the sz survey , which is roughly the amiba range ( fan & chiueh 2001 ) .",
    "the differential sz counts of clusters with a flux density @xmath123 mjy ( approximately the amiba flux sensitivity ) and the integrated sz counts of clusters within redshift @xmath124 are displayed in figure 1 and figure 2 for the three cosmological models and the two x - ray luminosity limits , respectively . we have extrapolated the cluster xlfs to @xmath125 , while at lower redshifts",
    "the sz counts are primarily governed by the lower x - ray luminosity limit @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "the latter accounts for the sharp drop of the sz counts towards @xmath115 especially in the case of @xmath128 , leading the maximum location ( @xmath129 ) of the differential sz counts to move to a larger redshift as compared with the curves predicted by the ps approach .",
    "beyond @xmath129 the differential sz counts given by mf follow the well - known dependence on cosmological models ( e.g. barbosa et al .",
    "1996 ; holder et al .",
    "2000 ) :    llllll model & @xmath5 & @xmath6 & @xmath130 & @xmath64 & @xmath7 + scdm & 1 & 0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.52 + @xmath120cdm & 0.3 & 0.7 & 0.83 & 0.25 & 0.93 + ocdm & 0.3 & 0 & 0.83 & 0.25 & 0.87 +    the sz cluster counts predicted by the mf , the non - evolving and evolving xlfs of clusters demonstrate remarkable differences : firstly , in the scenario of non - evolving xlf much more clusters would be expected at high redshifts than those predicted by the cluster mf and evolving xlf models .",
    "this explains the significant excess of differential sz counts at high redshifts in the non - evolving xlf model .",
    "secondly , as compared with the sz cluster counts depicted by the ps formalism , the evolving xlf model yields an excess of the sz counts within @xmath131 but a deficit at higher redshifts in @xmath120cdm and ocdm models . in scdm model , the opposite situation occurs at high redshifts .",
    "this last point can be understood qualitatively : the dark halos would experience a rapid evolution in scdm model than in @xmath120cdm and ocdm models .",
    "alternatively , we can not exclude the possibility that the above deficit of sz cluster counts at high reshifts predicted by the evolving xlf model in @xmath120cdm and ocdm is partially due to our extrapolation of the evolving xlf model by rosati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to high redshifts ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "nonetheless , it is seen that the expectations for sz cluster counts are indeed sensitive to the evolving xlf model .",
    "thirdly , the expected sz cluster counts depend critically on the adopted @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "the fact that neither of the xlf models can precisely reproduce the differential and integrated distributions of the sz clusters predicted by the standard ps formalism in three popular cosmological models especially in the @xmath120cdm arises from our shallow @xmath0-@xmath1 relations .",
    "note that the consistency in the distributions of sz cluster counts between the mf and xlf models are apparently improved for the cluster sample with the lower x - ray luminosity limit @xmath112 which exhibits a slightly steeper @xmath0-@xmath1 relation @xmath133 .",
    "recall that many previous attempts at reproducing the xlf and number counts of clusters from the ps formalism require a steep bolometric x - ray luminosity - temperature relation @xmath39 ( e.g. kitayama & suto 1997 ; mathiesen & evrard 1998 , borgani et al .",
    "in particular , a shallower @xmath0-@xmath1 relation leads to an underestimate of the local density of x - ray luminous clusters according to the ps approach ( mathiesen & evrard 1998 ) , which may partially account for the differences in the predicted sz clusters between the mf and xlf models at lower redshifts shown in figure 1 .",
    "fourthly , the slope of the integrated sz cluster counts , @xmath134 , depends not only on cosmological models as noticed in the literature ( e.g. barbosa et al .",
    "1996 ) but also on cluster xlf .",
    "for x - ray luminous clusters with @xmath111 , the total number of the predicted sz clusters can differ by an order of magnitude among the mf , the non - evolving and evolving xlf models . in a word ,",
    "the cosmological applications of sz cluster counts may be complicated by the presence of cosmic evolution of the intracluster gas which may not been fully accounted for in the cluster ms described by the ps formalism .",
    "the ps approximation has been widely adopted in the theoretical predictions of non - targeted sz surveys . in principle , such a treatment allows one to include the contribution of all the virialized halos distributed at different redshifts .",
    "it appears that the predicted sz counts can act as a sensitive probe of the cosmological parameters such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( barbosa et al .",
    "1996 ; holder et al .",
    "2000 ; springel et al .",
    "2000 ; bartlett 2000 ; fan & chiueh 2001 ; etc . ) . yet",
    ", the expectation for sz surveys within the framework of the ps formalism is based on an oversimplified scenario in which the isothermal gas is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with and follow the cosmic evolution of the underlying gravitational potentials of virialized dark halos .",
    "moreover , it does not account for the hot diffuse gas associated with large - scale structures or distributed beyond the virial radii , or non - gravitational heating effect .",
    "other work is thus needed to test and implement this purely theoretical treatment in order for future non - targeted sz surveys to become an effective probe of the universe . while a sophisticated treatment of the issue should eventually rely on numerical simulations , an approximate yet useful estimate of the sz counts of clusters",
    "would be possible by working with the observed xlf instead of the theoretically motivated mf .",
    "current x - ray observations suggest that bulk of rich clusters have experienced no significant evolution out to @xmath8 , whereas the most luminous , high redshift clusters are apparently rarer .",
    "with the employment of both non - evolving and evolving xlfs of clusters , together with the observationally determined @xmath0-@xmath1 relation and the virial theorem which set up a link between the sz flux and the cluster xlf , we have calculated the expected sz cluster counts for two x - ray luminosity limits , @xmath116 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath117 erg s@xmath3 in the 0.5 - 2.0 band .",
    "the non - evolving xlf has resulted in a significant excess of sz cluster counts at high redshift as compared with the evolving xlf . moreover ,",
    "a slightly steeper @xmath0-@xmath1 relation than the observed one ( @xmath135 in the bolometric band ) may be needed to reproduce the distributions of sz clusters predicted by the standard ps formalism even in the prevailing @xmath120cdm model .",
    "a comparison of the predicted sz number counts of clusters between mf and xlf is potentially important for the cosmological application of future sz surveys of clusters , e.g. the determination of the cosmological parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc . ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the sz cluster counts predicted by the two scenarios shown in the present paper seems to suggest that large uncertainties may arise if future sz cluster counts are directly fitted to the theoretical prediction by the standard ps model , although the present analysis may suffer from other problems such as the uncertainties in the cluster xlf and @xmath0-@xmath1 relation at high redshift .",
    "we emphasize that sz cluster surveys are uniquely governed by the content of intracluster gas and its dynamical and cosmic evolution , which are only indirectly related with the virialized dark halos . in this regard",
    ", the cluster xlf provides a better estimate of sz cluster counts .",
    "so , regardless of the uncertainties in the adopted xlf and @xmath0-@xmath1 relation our present expectations for sz cluster counts from cluster xlf can be considered to be a mock sz observation of clusters with the improvement of the accuracy in the determinations of the cluster xlf and @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , one will be soon able to have a more precise estimate of the sz cluster counts and compare it with the predictions of the ps approach .",
    "it is likely that further work should be done before sz cluster surveys are used for cosmological purpose .",

    "<S> we present a comparison of the sz cluster counts predicted by the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function ( mf ) and the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the employment of the cluster xlf , together with the observationally determined x - ray luminosity(@xmath0)-temperature(@xmath1 ) relation , may allow us to estimate the sz cluster counts in a more realistic manner , although such an empirical approach depends sensitively on our current knowledge of the dynamical properties of intracluster gas and its cosmic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> using both the non - evolving and evolving xlfs of clusters suggested by x - ray observations , we calculate the expectations for sz surveys of clusters with x - ray luminosity @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath4 erg s@xmath3 in the 0.5 - 2.0 band , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the non - evolving xlf results in a significant excess of sz cluster counts at high redshifts as compared with the evolving xlf , while a slightly steeper @xmath0-@xmath1 relation than the observed one is needed to reproduce the distributions of sz clusters predicted by the standard ps formalism . </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that uncertainties in the cosmological application of future sz cluster surveys via the standard ps formalism should be carefully studied . </S>"
