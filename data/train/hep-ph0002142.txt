    "the experimental measurement of the gauge self - couplings is an important test of the standard model ( sm ) , that is still at the beginning at present colliders .",
    "the trilinear gauge couplings have recently become a subject of studies at lep ii and tevatron ( for recent results , see @xcite ) , and will also be measured at the linear collider ( lc ) @xcite .",
    "the quartic couplings are very weakly constrained by present experimental data , through loop diagrams  @xcite , while the observation of quartic gauge coupling effects at tree - level at lep is rather difficult when photons are involved  @xcite and is completely outside the reach of lep when only massive gauge bosons are present .",
    "the determination of quadrilinear gauge couplings is of particular interest in connection with the problem of the electroweak symmetry breaking . indeed ,",
    "if a higgs boson lighter than 1 tev does not exist , the tree - level amplitudes for the gauge boson scattering in the standard model are known to violate the unitarity limits at tree - level , indicating the existence of strong interactions .",
    "this scenario can be the result of different models of symmetry breaking and may be described in the general framework of effective lagrangians , where the electroweak interactions in the low - energy limit are represented by one general parameterization @xcite .",
    "different values of the parameters correspond to different models .",
    "the effective lagrangian is organized as a power series in @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scale of momenta of the phenomena under study and @xmath5 gev is the scale of symmetry breaking .",
    "the lowest - order terms of this expansion are model - independent .",
    "the higher order terms involve new gauge coupling structures that give rise to anomalous vertices and contain coefficients that are model - dependent .",
    "it is worth noticing that the lowest - order non - trivial quartic couplings in the effective lagrangian ( that are the @xmath6 or dimension - four terms ) involve only massive gauge bosons and thus their effects can be observed either in loop contributions , or at tree - level in processes with at least six fermions in the final state .    the measurement of the parameters describing the gauge self - couplings , that gives the opportunity of constraining some possible models of new physics , will be an important objective of the lc , where significant improvements will be possible with respect to present colliders for various reasons . in the first place , the c.m .",
    "energy is sufficiently high for the production of up to three gauge bosons in the final state , making it possible to study the quadrilinear couplings at tree - level .",
    "moreover , since the deviations from the sm values of these couplings destroy the unitarity cancellations , their effect is enhanced at high energy . finally , the special features of the lc , such as the high luminosity and the possibility of having polarized @xmath7 and @xmath8 beams will provide a very high sensitivity to the anomalous couplings .",
    "several phenomenological studies have been performed on the possibility of constraining the anomalous quartic couplings at @xmath0 colliders in the approximation of real vector bosons in the final state , both for the couplings including photons  @xcite and for those involving gauge bosons only  @xcite . in the latter case , however , for more realistic predictions , as observed above , processes with at least six fermions in the final state have to be examined .",
    "this kind of processes also allows for the analysis of final - state distributions that are not accessible in the real approximation , and that can give useful information .",
    "the objective of the present study is to analyse a class of six - fermion ( @xmath9 ) processes where the genuine quartic gauge couplings of dimension four are involved .",
    "the results that will be shown have been obtained by means of complete tree - level calculations in the framework of the chiral approach to electroweak interactions .    in section  [ sect:2 ] the theoretical framework and some technical details of the calculation are explained . in section  [ sect:3 ]",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed , and section  [ sect:4 ] contains the conclusions .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide an analysis , that has never been done till now , of the impact of a complete electroweak @xmath9 calculation on the study of anomalous quartic couplings .",
    "the numerical results contained in the following section are a first illustrative application of the new implementation of anomalous couplings in the code mentioned above , and the processes considered , although not giving a complete picture of the anomalous quartic coupling phenomenology , are relevant due to their sizeable , as can be seen below .",
    "the processes @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , have been considered .",
    "this choice is motivated by the two objectives of having contributions from all possible quartic vertices involved in the anomalous terms under consideration , and of having no more than two neutrinos in the final state .",
    "the first point can be explained by considering the signature @xmath38 : as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : agcd0 ] , that shows the diagrams with a quadrilinear vertex , this signature includes contributions from the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath27 vertices .    from the point of view of the calculation , in order to obtain the correct sum over colours , with the version of alpha used here , that does not contain the colour degrees of freedom , it is necessary to apply a procedure analogous to the one already illustrated in ref .",
    "this procedure consists of the combination , with proper weights , of the results from the different processes and is valid in the approximation of massless quarks and unit ckm matrix .",
    "the signatures @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 must be combined according to the following formula : [ eq:3.1 ] _ uudd + _ udcs + _ uuss = n_c(_uudd + ( 2n_c-1)(_udcs+_uuss ) )  , where the results directly provided by alpha are denoted by @xmath41 , while the  including the colour degrees of freedom are denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "the signatures @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are obtained from the previous ones by means of the simultaneous exchanges @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and , given the set of parameters adopted here , they give exactly the same result , so that they can be easily taken into account by including a factor of 2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) .    in principle , assuming that the @xmath48-tagging technique is applied , and thus the @xmath48 quark can be identified , a realistic calculation should take into account all the possible combinations of the remaining flavours , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 that can not be distinguished .",
    "these combinations include , in addition to those mentioned above , the final states @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55",
    "@xmath56 and those obtained from these with the exchanges @xmath46 and @xmath47 . moreover a sum over the neutrino flavours should be made .",
    "such signatures have been neglected in this first analysis .",
    "nevertheless , it will be possible to examine the most important qualitative features of the phenomenology of anomalous gauge couplings in @xmath9 processes , while referring to further developments for a better accuracy from a quantitative point of view .",
    "in the following , the results of complete electroweak calculations at tree level are presented , where the above specified class of processes is considered .    as can be seen in the scattering of real gauge bosons , as a consequence of the absence of the higgs boson and of the gauge cancellations that ensure unitarity ,",
    "the  at high energy can be expected to increase rapidly and to violate the unitarity bounds .",
    "the energy at which unitarity is violated depends on the values of the parameters @xmath29 : these should then be taken within some bounds if the unitarity condition has to be respected at a given energy .",
    "however , it is useful to make a first rough analysis of the dependence of the  on the anomalous parameters in a wide range , while the sensitivity to the anomalous couplings in a smaller range will be studied in a second step .",
    "thus , in the first set of results , the  has been evaluated at the two c.m .",
    "energies of 500 gev and 1 tev , and allowing each of the coefficients @xmath29 to vary in the range @xmath57 , while keeping all the others equal to zero .",
    "a simple set of kinematical constraints has been adopted , by requiring the invariant masses of the `` up - anti - up '' and `` down - anti - down '' quark pairs to be greater than 70 gev ( where `` up '' stands for @xmath49 and @xmath51 and `` down '' for @xmath50 and @xmath52 ) , so as to eliminate the soft photon contributions to pair production .    in the plots of fig .",

    "the  turns out to have a very strong growth with energy for large values of the anomalous coefficients .",
    "the growth of the  with energy is in agreement with results for the scattering of real longitudinal gauge bosons obtained by means of the equivalence theorem  @xcite .",
    "moreover it can be observed that the greatest effects are given by the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while the coefficient @xmath60 gives the smallest effect .",
    "to understand this fact it is useful to examine the expressions of the operators in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.6][eq:2.10 ] ) , where it can be seen that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the only terms where the vertex @xmath23 appears .",
    "this vertex gives a greater enhancement with respect to the others due to the fact that the couplings of the @xmath33 boson to the fermions are stronger than those of the @xmath18 boson .",
    "for the same reason , the operator @xmath61 has the smallest effect , since it contributes only to the @xmath27 vertex .",
    "moreover the @xmath27 vertex , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : agcd0 ] , can appear only in @xmath52-channel diagrams , and has not the advantage of the @xmath62-channel growth at high energy .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath60 , that induce violation of the custodial symmetry , are more constrained by the radiative corrections to the @xmath65 parameter with respect to @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "energy is considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : a45sscanr ] , where the energy range between 500 gev and 1 tev is studied for the case without anomalous couplings and for two choices of the anomalous parameters taken as examples , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "the solid curves include initial - state radiation  @xcite ( isr ) and beamstrahlung  @xcite ( bs ) , while the dashed ones are in the born approximation .",
    "the growth with energy is already present when the parameters @xmath29 are equal to zero , and is enhanced when they are different from zero .",
    "the effect of isr and bs is to reduce the effective c.m .",
    "energy , and this explains the observed lowering of @xmath68 in the  with respect to the born approximation .    in order to study the sensitivity of some differential distributions to the anomalous couplings , two samples of events have then been generated , one with all the @xmath29 equal to zero and the other with @xmath69 .",
    "energy is 1 tev and the numbers of events correspond to a luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath70 . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : a45sscanr ] , all the quark pairs have an invariant mass greater than 60 gev .",
    "a relatively large value of @xmath58 has been chosen , so as to have sizeable effects : indeed , the objective of this analysis is to obtain clear indications on the cuts to be applied for enhancing the sensitivity to the anomalous couplings under study . among the variables considered ,",
    "the ones that turn out to be most sensitive to the parameter @xmath58 are defined in the following way .",
    "the invariant mass of the system of four jets is indicated as @xmath71 .",
    "this variable does not require any identification procedure .",
    "the other variables that have been studied are based instead on simple identification algorithms , to take into account the fact that the quark flavours are not distinguishable .",

    "the angle of one reconstructed @xmath33 boson with respect to the beam axis is indicated as @xmath75 . for each event , the four jets are ordered in transverse momentum and are labelled with @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the one with greatest @xmath78 .",
    "the invariant masses of pairs of jets are then considered , and one in particular , @xmath79 , that is the invariant mass of the pair of jets with lowest @xmath78 , is found to be most sensitive to the anomalous couplings under study . in fig .",

    "significant deviations are found in the shapes of the distributions .",
    "this is due to the lorentz structures of the anomalous vertices involved , that tend to populate the region of phase - space with high transverse momenta for the gauge bosons .    in view of a realistic simulation ,",
    "these distributions include the effects of isr and bs .",
    "it has been verified that these effects do not introduce significant variations with respect to the born approximation , as can be expected , since the variables considered do not involve the momenta of the neutrinos .    on the contrary , the distribution of the missing mass , defined as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the missing momentum , is strongly affected by isr and bs .",
    "this variable , that in the born approximation is the invariant mass of the neutrino pair , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmiss ] : in the upper plot the case with @xmath82 is considered , while the lower plot refers to @xmath69 .",
    "the solid histograms include isr and bs , the dashed histograms are in the born approximation . in both plots the peaks corresponding to the @xmath18 mass are almost cancelled by the effects of isr and bs .",
    "results very similar to those illustrated above are obtained for the coupling @xmath59 . on the basis of this analysis of distributions ,",
    "suitable cuts have then been determined to enhance the sensitivity to the anomalous couplings @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : a45fine ] , where the  in the born approximation is shown as a function of the parameters @xmath58 ( upper plot ) and @xmath59 ( lower plot ) in the range @xmath83 .",
    "the cuts are defined as follows : @xmath71 is greater than 420 gev , the invariant mass of the two jets with the lowest transverse momenta , @xmath84 , is greater than 80 gev and the angle of one reconstructed @xmath33 boson with respect to the beam axis satisfies @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , the invariant mass of all the quark pairs is greater than 60 gev .",
    "it has been found that neither the addition of a cut on the variable @xmath86 nor its substitution to one of the above cuts can improve the results obtained . in the same plots ,",
    "the @xmath87 limits around the value of the  for @xmath82 , with an experimental error corresponding to a luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath70 , are shown .",
    "it can be seen that the sensitivity to the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 turns out to be in the range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these conclusions are not modified by the introduction of isr and bs , since the variables used in the cuts are not sensitive to these effects .",
    "the analysis of anomalous dimension - four quartic gauge couplings involves processes with at least six fermions in the final state .",
    "a set of processes of this kind has been considered in this work . by using a monte carlo event generator that has already been employed for other phenomenological studies on @xmath9 physics , complete tree - level results",
    "have been obtained , in the context of the electroweak chiral lagrangian formalism .",
    "the five dimension - four operators giving genuine quartic anomalous couplings have been considered , and a special attention has been devoted to the two custodial - symmetry conserving ones , usually indicated by @xmath20 and @xmath21 and involving the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 . after studying the energy dependence of the  and the effects of initial - state - radiation and beamstrahlung , a set of kinematical cuts has been considered in order to enhance the signals of the anomalous couplings .",
    "a sensitivity to the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 has been found at 1 tev .",
    "the results discussed above can be seen as an example of the possibilities of study of these phenomena through a complete tree - level simulation of @xmath9 processes . in order to make the calculations quantitatively more accurate , some simplifications that have been adopted here",
    "should be eliminated : namely the class of signatures to be taken into account should include a full sum over the indistinguishable neutrino and quark flavour combinations in the final state , and the effect of qcd backgrounds should be considered . in particular the latter improvement can be achieved by means of the last version of alpha  @xcite , that includes the qcd lagrangian .",
