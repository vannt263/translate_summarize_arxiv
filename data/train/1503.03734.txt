    "we notice that the factor 10 between the @xmath36 values is related to the ratio of their relevant energies , then we can compare their tep response taking into account this factor 10 in temperature analysis .. figure [ fig12 ] shows the longitudinal and transverse tep responses of ceru@xmath9si@xmath9 at 290  mk by comparison to the cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 ones at 3  k. at @xmath168 in ceru@xmath9si@xmath9 a drastic change of the fs has been reported @xcite and is associated with a strong increase of @xmath68 and @xmath36 right at @xmath168 preserving a quasi constant @xmath159 ratio . due to the large magnetoresistivity anisotropy , the transverse and longitudinal signals have opposite sign response at @xmath168 .",
    "however , the metamagnetic transitions present quite similar width , @xmath171  2 t , for transverse and longitudinal configurations . this width is quite larger than the width detected for cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 at @xmath2 ( @xmath172 0.02 ) . comparing to ucoal that presents a first order metamagnetic transition from pm to fm",
    ", we notice that a sharp change of @xmath78 at the transition also occurs in this compound @xmath173 .",
    "thus , the tep signal in cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 at @xmath131 is clearly governed by the strong first order nature of the metamagnetic transition while the fs crossover detected at @xmath168 in ceru@xmath9si@xmath9 is characteristic of a sole lifshitz transition .",
    "these new cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 data lead to emphasize its difference with the isostructural yb compound ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9 .",
    "previous discussions can be found in refs . .",
    "in case of cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 there is no divergence of @xmath68 or @xmath36 coefficient at @xmath4 or @xmath2 .",
    "such phenomena have been reported for the yb heavy fermion system ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9 ( t@xmath174  mk ) as the magnetic field is swept through the af phase transition ( @xmath175  t along the easy axis)@xcite .",
    "kondo breakdown has been involved in this system with the new idea of local quantum criticality with fluctuations between small and large fs .",
    "although a signature of a fs change has been observed in hall effect @xcite no corresponding variation in the tep can be detected on approaching @xmath176 for @xmath48@xcite .",
    "however a lifshitz transition appears at @xmath177  t@xmath178 as the magnetic polarization reaches a critical value @xcite .",
    "the common feature of the anomaly at @xmath179 in ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9 and here at the first order transition of cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 at @xmath131 is the crossing through a critical value of electronic polarization .",
    "indeed , this mechanism may imply metamagnetism ( case of ceru@xmath9si@xmath9 ) or not ( case of ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9 ) .",
    "recently the observation of the itinerant nature of @xmath7 electrons in ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9 in the pm phase above @xmath147 at zero magnetic field @xcite ( in good agreement with previous dhva experiments @xcite ) leads to a strong suspicion on the switch of the @xmath7 localization to describe the quantum phase transition . a new approach",
    "is so called strong coupling theory of heavy fermion criticality @xcite , the basic phenomena being that critical spin fluctuations of the af wave vector @xmath180 induces fluctuations at small @xmath181 with the consequence of diverging effective mass over the whole fs .    in the weak coupling case of cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 , the switch from itinerant to localized picture is driven by the onset of the af order and its associated brillouin zone change .",
    "the consequence on ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9 is still an open question as the magnetic structure has not been determined yet .",
    "cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 presents the additional property to lose its magnetic anisotropy under pressure presumably on entering in the mixed valence regime while in ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9 the change of the anisotropy on entering in the trivalent regime seems to occur only above 90  kbar @xcite .",
    "as emphasized at @xmath6 in cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 the intersite magnetic coupling ( @xmath38 ) is higher or comparable to the kondo energy . in ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9",
    "it is quite the opposite however the trivalent configuration can be stabilized enough to present very low energy excitation and at the end in the mk range to order magnetically since the 13 electrons of the @xmath7 shell ( @xmath182 ) are strongly localized by comparison to the @xmath183 case@xcite .",

    "three different fermi surfaces ( labeled fs i , ii , iii ) correspond to the af , pm , ppm states . due to the 1@xmath186 order nature of the quantum phase transition at @xmath81 ,",

    "the ( @xmath22 , @xmath12 , @xmath6 ) lines as well as the ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath11 ) ones have been determined by tep measurements .",
    "due to the first order nature of the quantum phase transition at @xmath81 , the fermi liquid ( fl ) temperature below which @xmath66 fl law is obeyed is finite at @xmath81 ( @xmath187 2  k ) .",
    "the lines drawn on the ( @xmath188 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 ) planes ( using partly ref .  ) are possible guesses with @xmath2 terminating at a critical end point with a continuation by a cross over line above @xmath81 .",
    "another possibility , as it happens for the system ce(rh@xmath189ru@xmath190 ) @xmath9si@xmath9 @xcite , will be the collapse of @xmath131 at @xmath81 and thus a decoupling between @xmath155 and @xmath131 . in this phase diagram ,",
    "the superconducting ( sc ) domain glued on @xmath81 is represented ; the sc territory appears quite narrow . clearly , it is necessary to revisit the sc properties .",
    "our main message is that af , pm and ppm phases have three different fs . as with @xmath11 scan in high magnetic field ( @xmath13 for @xmath191 and @xmath192 for @xmath193 ) no phase transition",
    "is expected , no @xmath11 modification of the fs topology may occur in the ppm domain . as discussed for the pseudometamagnetism of ceru@xmath9si@xmath9 @xcite , an itinerant description on cerh@xmath9si@xmath9 close to @xmath4 whatever is the strength of the magnetic field seems a sound approach . to confirm the validity of our conclusions , new experiments must be realized .",
    "for example at @xmath6 , inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystal will confirm or not if the intersite magnetic coupling overpasses the kondo energy and will establish if the crystal field excitations are dispersionless .",
    "further high pressure experiments far above @xmath4 will validate or not our proposal of the proximity of @xmath4 and @xmath157 .",
    "the loss of the ising character on crossing @xmath4 must be confirmed by microscopic measurements . by high energy spectroscopy experiments ,",
    "the pressure evolution of the @xmath7 trivalent occupancy number ( n@xmath194 ) should be determined as well as the crystal structure .",
    "a recent advance is a precise determination of the fs at zero pressure in both pm ( @xmath195 ) and af ( @xmath196 ) by arpes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dhva signal change at @xmath131 on entering in the ppm phase has been recently observed directly @xcite .",
