    "let @xmath0 be a random sample from the probability density function @xmath1 .",
    "the kernel density estimator of @xmath1 is computed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a smoothing parameter that is usually called the bandwidth , and the kernel @xmath4 is assumed to be of the second order , which means that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "most frequent choices of @xmath4 include the gaussian , epanechnikov , and quartic kernels ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the two most commonly used measures of performance of @xmath8 are the integrated squared error ( ise ) and the mean integrated squared error ( mise ) defined as @xmath9 let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the minimizers of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 functions , respectively .    both bandwidths @xmath10 and @xmath11 are unavailable for practical use since their computation requires knowing @xmath1 .",
    "there exist many data - driven bandwidth selection techniques ( see the survey of  @xcite ) .",
    "some of the most popular bandwidth selectors are the plug - in rule of  @xcite and the least squares cross - validation ( lscv ) method proposed independently by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the cross - validation method is quite popular among practitioners because of its simplicity .",
    "moreover , it requires fewer assumptions on @xmath1 compared to the plug - in method .",
    "nevertheless , the method is criticized because of producing too variable bandwidths and selecting the trivial bandwidths for the data sets that contain substantial amount of tied observations ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "a well known lscv paradox consists in the method s improved performance on the harder estimation problems ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a couple of successful modifications of the lscv method that take advantage of this paradox are the one - sided cross - validation ( oscv ) method proposed by  @xcite and the indirect cross - validation ( icv ) method of  @xcite .",
    "both methods are supported by the corresponding r packages ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    the oscv method is originally introduced in the regression context ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite extended the method to the case of smooth densities .",
    "a density function @xmath1 is referred to as _",
    "smooth _ if it is twice continuously differentiable , whereas it is called _ nonsmooth _ if it is continuous but has finitely many simple discontinuity points in its first derivative . the oscv method in the smooth case is shown to greatly stabilize the bandwidth distribution ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this article extends the oscv method to the case of nonsmooth density functions .",
    "@xcite introduced the left - sided and right - sided oscv versions based on the so - called left - sided and right - sided kernels , respectively .",
    "both one - sided kernels are obtained by multiplying a benchmark two - sided kernel by a linear function and restricting the support of the one - sided kernel to either @xmath14 $ ] ( left - sided case ) or @xmath15 ( right - sided case ) . in this article we restrict our attention on the right - sided oscv version .",
    "the right - sided kernel @xmath16 based on the benchmark two - sided kernel @xmath17 is computed as @xmath18 it follows that @xmath16 is of the second order .",
    "generally , the benchmark kernel @xmath17 is different from the kernel @xmath4 used to compute @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite implemented oscv based on @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the epanechnikov kernel .",
    "the oscv function based on a one - sided kernel @xmath16 is defined as @xmath21 where the definition of @xmath22 is given in the appendix . in the above expression @xmath23",
    "is the density estimator based on the kernel @xmath16 and the bandwidth @xmath24 , whereas @xmath25 is its leave - one - out modification that is computed from all data points except @xmath26 .",
    "the above version of the oscv function mimics the traditional definition of the cv function of  @xcite and  @xcite and slightly differs from the function used in  @xcite and the follow - up articles ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in the oscv function of  @xcite , the estimator @xmath27 under the sum is replaced by @xmath23 .",
    "this is justified by assuming @xmath28 .",
    "we find this assumption rather restrictive since the one - sided versions of the most frequently used kernels do not possess this property . since the case @xmath29 does not substantially complicate the oscv implementation , we proceed by using  .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the minimizer of  .",
    "@xcite defined the oscv bandwidth in the smooth case as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 the functionals @xmath22 and @xmath33 are defined in the appendix .",
    "the oscv bandwidth @xmath34 is consistent for the mise optimal bandwidth @xmath11 , that is @xmath35 .",
    "in this section we extend the oscv algorithm to the case of a nonsmooth density @xmath1 that has simple discontinuities in its first derivative at the points @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the extension is based on the asymptotic expansion of mise of the kernel density estimator in the nonsmooth case ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) that has the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined in the appendix .",
    "the above expression yields the following asymptotically optimal bandwidth @xmath41 : @xmath42 the asymptotic expansion of @xmath43 , the mise function for @xmath23 , has the same form as that of @xmath44 with @xmath4 and @xmath45 being replaced by @xmath16 and @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the asymptotically optimal bandwidth for @xmath43 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath47 this motivates defining the oscv bandwidth in the nonsmooth case as @xmath48 .    in both smooth and nonsmooth cases the oscv bandwidth",
    "is defined by multiplying @xmath30 , the minimizer of the oscv function  , by a rescaling constant .",
    "the constant @xmath49   is used in the smooth case , whereas the constant @xmath50   is used in the nonsmooth case .",
    "it is remarkable that the expressions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are identical to those in the oscv implementation for regression functions ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "this follows from similarity of the corresponding asymptotic expansions of mise of the kernel density estimator and the mean average squared error ( mase ) of the local linear estimator .",
    "the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the case @xmath51 for the most frequently used kernels @xmath4 and their one - sided counterparts @xmath16 are given in table  [ tab : constants ] .    .rescaling constants for the most frequently used kernels.[tab : constants ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the robust kernel used in the fully robust oscv implementation in the regression context ( see  @xcite ) is also robust in the density estimation setting .",
    "this kernel is a member of the following family : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a two - sided counterpart of @xmath54 , and @xmath55 the kernel has @xmath56 and is plotted in figure  [ fig : robust_kernels ]  * ( a)*. it is worth to mention that the one - sided gaussian kernel @xmath57 is obtained from   by either setting @xmath58 or @xmath59 .    despite the fact that the kernel with @xmath56 works well in the regression context ( see  @xcite ) , its performance in the density estimation framework is unsatisfactory .",
    "our inspection of the @xmath54-based oscv curves for a sequence of random samples generated from @xmath60 revealed that the considerable part of them has two local minima with the largest one being inappropriately large .",
    "however , the more serious problem with @xmath54 is that it frequently produces the oscv curves that tend to @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite argued that the lscv method experiences this type of problem even for such frequently used kernels as epanechnikov , quartic , and gaussian .",
    "inappropriate performance of the kernel with @xmath56 on @xmath60 stimulated further search for the robust kernels .",
    "first of all , we inspected performances of two other robust kernels mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "both these kernels are members of the family   with @xmath63 and the values of @xmath64 equal to 0.4275 and 0.9821 .",
    "one of the kernels ( with @xmath65 ) is plotted in figure  [ fig : robust_kernels ] * ( b)*. the other kernel ( with @xmath66 ) has a similar shape and performance .",
    "unfortunately , both kernels are found to produce highly variable and biased upwards bandwidth distributions , at least in the case of @xmath60 .    in our next attempt , we considered another member of   with @xmath67 that is plotted in figure  [ fig : robust_kernels ] * ( c)*. this kernel is almost robust with @xmath68 .",
    "it has a quite different shape compared to the one - sided kernels considered so far , but , unfortunately , performs even worse than them . indeed , for all inspected realizations from @xmath60 and the @xmath69 density it produced the oscv curves that tended to @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "it is remarkable that the kernel with @xmath67 is equal to zero at the origin .",
    "this implies that @xmath70 , the two - sided counterpart of this kernel , is nonnegative and bimodal ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "according to  @xcite and  @xcite such a kernel has potential for oscv implementation in the regression context .    further experimenting with the kernels from the family   is possible by using the r function ` oscv_li_dens ` from the r package ` oscv ` .",
    "indeed , many other robust kernels can be found in  .",
    "it is entirely possible that there exists one that performs better than the kernels discussed above .",
    "three other almost robust kernels considered below are not the members of   but originate from the dissertation of  @xcite .",
    "these kernels , denoted by @xmath71 @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , are defined below .",
    "figure  [ fig : robust_kernels ] * ( d ) * shows @xmath71 .",
    "the graphs of the other two kernels are not included since they are fairly similar in shape to @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath74}(u),}\\\\ \\displaystyle{l_2(u)=30u^2(1-u)^2(8 - 14u)i_{[0,1]}(u),}\\\\ \\displaystyle{l_3(u)=140u^3(1-u)^3(10 - 18u)i_{[0,1]}(u ) . } \\end{array}\\ ] ] all of the above kernels have @xmath75 .",
    "it appears that each of the kernels @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 produces quite wiggly oscv curves for random samples generated from @xmath60 and the @xmath69 density .",
    "the figure  [ fig : robust_kernels ] shows variety of robust and almost robust one - sided kernels of different shapes , but none of them performs satisfactory in the case of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , finding a kernel that improves practical performance of the method in the nonsmooth case appears to be an open challenging problem .",
    "the oscv method for smooth density functions is proposed by  @xcite . in this article",
    "we extend the oscv methodology to the case of nonsmooth densities .",
    "we also introduce the fully robust oscv version that produces consistent bandwidths in both smooth and nonsmooth cases .",
    "the proposed oscv modifications , essentially , use different one - sided kernels to select the bandwidths by the cross - validation method .",
    "the selected bandwidths are then rescaled and plugged - in to the gaussian density estimator . the nonsmooth density @xmath60 plotted in figure  [ fig : f_nonsmooth ]  * ( a ) *",
    "is used for discrimination of the proposed oscv extensions .",
    "we found and investigated many robust and almost robust kernel candidates for the fully robust oscv implementation .",
    "some of them are shown in figure  [ fig : robust_kernels ] .",
    "none of these kernels performs satisfactory in the case of @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the nonsmooth version of oscv based on the one - sided gaussian kernel @xmath57 performs worse that the ordinary lscv method in the case of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , practical implementations of the proposed theoretical extensions remain open to further research efforts .",
    "the main problems experienced by the majority of the considered robust and almost robust one - sided kernels were selecting too variable bandwidths and/or producing multiple local minima in the oscv curves .",
    "similar difficulties were faced when implementing the icv method ( see  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that some nontraditional negative - valued cross - validation kernels may substantially improve the asymptotic properties of the cross - validation method while introducing challenging problems with their practical use .",
    "the current implementation of the oscv method in the smooth case of  @xcite is based on the one - sided epanechnikov kernel @xmath76 .",
    "it appears that @xmath76 produces inappropriately wiggly oscv curves in the case of @xmath60 ( see figure  [ fig : oscv_realization_epanechnikov ] * ( b ) * ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath76 frequently yields insufficiently smooth oscv curves even in the case of the standard normal density ( see figure  [ fig : oscv_realization_norm ] * ( a ) * ) .",
    "the problem of @xmath76 occasionally producing rough criterion curves persists for real data sets ( see figure  [ fig : oscv_geyser ] * ( a ) * ) . on the other hand , we empirically found that for variety of smooth and nonsmooth densities and different sample sizes , the one - sided gaussian kernel @xmath57 usually produces smooth oscv curves with one local minimum ( see figures  [ fig : oscv_realization_epanechnikov ] * ( a ) * , [ fig : oscv_realization_norm ] * ( b ) * and  [ fig : oscv_geyser ] * ( b ) * for illustration ) .",
    "this indicates that @xmath57 might be , potentially , superior than @xmath76 for practical implementation of the oscv method in the smooth case .",
    "this matter , however , requires further investigation that is out of scope of this article that is mainly devoted to extending oscv to the case of nonsmooth densities .",
    "the almost robust one - sided kernel shown in figure  [ fig : robust_kernels ]  * ( c ) * with @xmath67 has a nonnegative two - sided counterpart @xmath70 .",
    "it then follows from the conclusions of  @xcite and  @xcite that this kennel might , potentially , lead to successful implementation of the fully robust oscv method in the regression context .",
    "this article and the recent publication of  @xcite are supported by the r package ` oscv ` that can be used for reproducing the presented results and allows for further experimenting in attempts of improving the oscv method s practical implementation for smooth and nonsmooth density and regression functions .",
