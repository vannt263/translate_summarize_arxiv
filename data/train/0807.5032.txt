    "there is a vast literature where the anharmonic oscillator is studied from various points of view .",
    "the aim of this paper is to bring some of these ideas together .",
    "the paper consists of two parts .",
    "the first part is devoted to the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillator at even negative @xmath1 @xmath5 understood in the sense of analytical continuation .",
    "a remarkable feature of these values of @xmath1 is that a part of the spectrum can be found by solving algebraic equations . in principle , this fact is known since long ago @xcite but as usual with exactly solvable models , one can arrive at the same results using many different ways , and the alternative derivations discussed here may deserve attention .    the second part of the paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of large orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "as is well known , the perturbative series for the anharmonic oscillator is divergent because of the factorial growth of the coefficients .",
    "however , one can show that in even negative dimensions ( [ d - even - negative ] ) the factorial growth disappears and the perturbative series becomes convergent .",
    "taken alone , this fact is quite natural and not too exciting . but this observation gives an interesting solution to another old problem .",
    "let us return to the case of general @xmath1 where we have the factorial growth of perturbative coefficients .",
    "it is well known that the asymptotic behavior of large-@xmath6 orders of the perturbation theory is reached very slowly because of the @xmath7 corrections that are usually rather large in practically interesting cases",
    ". therefore it would be rather interesting to construct quantities for which the asymptotic regime is reached faster than @xmath7 .",
    "this problem is especially acute in quantum field theoretical models where only several first orders of the perturbation theory can be usually computed . in this paper",
    "we construct and study special quantities whose approach to the asymptotic regime is _ factorially fast _ instead of the traditional slow @xmath7 convergence to the asymptotic form .",
    "it is interesting that the same construction can be used in quantum field theory .",
    "in fact , this paper appeared as an attempt to understand some superfast convergence effects that are seen in quantum field theory @xcite .    before starting with a detailed derivation of the exact solution for the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillator at negative even dimensions @xmath1",

    "testing some special cases , the authors of @xcite found an unexpected factorization of their polynomials into `` elementary polynomials '' . in the framework of the current paper",

    "this approach is very close to the method of original work @xcite but we implement this method so that the @xmath21 algebra remains explicit .",

    "the answer is that these roots have a very interesting property : in the limit @xmath31 some subsets of the roots are convergent to points @xmath32 and this convergence is factorially fast . in quantum mechanics this superfast factorial convergence may be an amazing but useless curiosity .",
    "however , in the context of quantum field theory analogous effects are important .",
    "indeed , in quantum field theory one is usually limited to a rather small amount of perturbative terms .",
    "four or five orders are usually considered as a great achievement .",
    "therefore the existence of quantities with factorial convergence to the asymptotic form instead of the slow @xmath7 convergence of ( [ e - k - asymptotic-0 ] ) is extremely interesting for field theoretical applications .",
