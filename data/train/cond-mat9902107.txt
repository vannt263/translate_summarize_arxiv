    "in the hope to get a better understanding of strongly interacting systems , there has been considerable interest in ladder systems .",
    "@xcite these ladder systems have proven to be a theoretical wonderland , both analytically @xcite and numerically .",
    "@xcite however , much of the analytic work done on ladders has been in weak coupling ( or perturbatively in some parameter ) , namely because there are very few analytic methods at strong coupling .",
    "exact diagonalization , monte carlo , and density matrix renormalization group methods have been the primary tools for studying these systems at strong coupling .",
    "each of these methods has both strengths and weaknesses when considering the lattice sizes , temperatures , and couplings on can consider .    with the ability to fabricate these materials ,",
    "@xcite ladders are not just a theoretical playground .",
    "for example , in @xmath0 , there are well separated two - leg ladders composed of @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite also the cuprate - like material @xmath2 consists of weakly coupled @xmath3 two - leg ladders , @xcite and the material @xmath4 consists of weakly coupled @xmath3 three - leg ladders .",
    "@xcite    recently , a powerful analytic method was developed to deal with strongly coupled quasi - one dimensional systems  the recurrent variational approach ( rva ) .",
    "@xcite this method is similar in spirit to wilson s numerical renormalization group @xcite and white s density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "@xcite the key idea in all of these methods is to build up the system by adding on sites at the boundary .",
    "however , the real power of the rva is that , though analytic , the physics of the problem is taken into account in an unbiased way and elucidated quite clearly .",
    "for example , the importance of different configurations in the ground state wave function is determined without any outside assumptions , and the physics of these configurations is made clear .    in this work",
    ", we apply the rva to the two - leg hubbard ladder at strong coupling and small dopings .",
    "though a considerable amount of work has been done on the hubbard ladder and many of its properties are known , we are unaware of any work which has put this information together and constructed a ground state wave function . our goal in this work is to provide a simple physical picture of what the ground state might look like and to go ahead and construct a ground state wave function .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two - leg hubbard ladder is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 creates a fermion at site * i * with spin @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the hopping matrix element along the chain , @xmath10 is the hopping matrix element perpendicular to the chain ( i.e. , along the rung ) , and @xmath11 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "site * i * has coordinates @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it will also be convenient to introduce the following two operators : @xmath15 which creates a singlet across sites * i * and * j * , and @xmath16 which creates a doubly occupied site .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider the half - filled case . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the hubbard ladder at small dopings . in sec .",
    "iv we present our results for the ground state energies and compare with dmrg . finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize our results and present some concluding remarks .",
    "we begin with the half - filled ladder . what are the ingredients necessary to construct a wave function which captures the physics of the half - filled hubbard ladder ?",
    "a trail of clues has been laid by previous works .",
    "first of all , we know that at strong coupling the half - filled    = 3.25 in    hubbard model is equivalent to the heisenberg model . secondly , it is known that the two - leg heisenberg ladder ( and hubbard ladder ) have a spin gap and short range spin correlations .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state captures the essential physics of the two - leg heisenberg ladder.@xcite hence , the rvb picture should capture the essential physics of the half - filled hubbard ladder at strong coupling .",
    "thus we propose a generalization of the rvb state as our variational ansatz .",
    "a key property of the rvb state is that it is the exact solution to the @xmath17 heisenberg plaquette .",
    "therefore , we base our generalized rvb state on the exact solution to the @xmath17 hubbard plaquette . since the @xmath17 plaquette will serve as the basis for our ansatz , we discuss it in detail below .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath17 plaquette is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:2x2half ]",
    ".    we will be mainly interested in the case @xmath21 . in table",
    "[ table:2x2half ] we list the values of the parameters for several values of @xmath11 ( with @xmath22 ) .",
    "= 3.1 in    .values of the parameters for the half - filled 2x2 plaquette ( with @xmath23 ) which give the exact groundstate .

    "@xcite these facts continue to be true for low doping in larger ladders .",
    "also , notice that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is from the half - filled ladder .",
    "this will play a role in writing our ansatz for the doped ladder .      using the configurations of the generalized rvb state as well as the hole pair configurations , a typical configuration for the doped ladder",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : typicaldoped ] .",
    "= 2.9 in = .6 in    the ground state will be a superposition of all such configurations shown in fig .",

    "recursively_. specifically , we build the ground state of a ladder with @xmath28 rungs and @xmath29 holes using the knowledge of the ground states of a ladder with @xmath30 rungs and @xmath31 holes .",
    "this is achieved by recursion relations which express the ground state @xmath32 in terms of the ground states @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35.@xcite    using the above ingredients , we consider the following ansatz for the doped hubbard ladder @xmath36    = 3.6 in = 2.9 in    which is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : goodstates1 ] . for completeness , the states in terms of the operators in eqs .",
    "[ singlet ] and [ double ] are given in appendix b.    a few words are in order about the configurations in our ansatz .",
    "i ) the ansatz contains the configurations for the rvb state , as well as the configurations for holes bound in pairs .",
    "the hole pair states are based on the exact solution to the 2x2 plaquette with 2 holes , and our ansatz reproduces this exact solution .",
    "ii ) the states @xmath37 and @xmath38 extend over three rungs .",
    "these states are necessary to allow the hole pairs to move smoothly through the rvb background .",
    "iii ) note that physically , the picture of hole pairs moving through an rvb background can only be appropriate for low dopings .    to compute the values of the coefficients in our ansatz ,",
    "we treat them as variational parameters and minimize the ground - state energy with respect to these parameters",
    ". it will be useful to define @xmath39 they are supplemented by the initial conditions @xmath40    to determine the values for the variational parameters for given ( finite ) values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we iterate the recursion relations and we minimize the quantity @xmath43 .",
    "the actual recursion relations are quite unwieldly ; we have relegated them , as well as their derivation , to appendix b.    what is the nature of the state we have constructed ? in order to answer this question , we plot @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 vs. doping .",
    "these parameters contain most of the physics of our ansatz .",
    "@xmath44 is the `` rvb parameter '' ; @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the weights of the hole pair configurations .",
    "the results were obtained on a @xmath47 ladder .",
    "first , consider fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters](a ) .",
    "@xmath44 begins at @xmath48 and increases ( i.e. , becomes less negative ) with doping until a critical doping , @xmath49 , where it vanishes . beyond this doping",
    ", @xmath44 is positive .",
    "this has also been found for the @xmath50 ladder . @xcite",
    "upon doping , the hole pairs cause destructive interference which degrades the rvb mechanism . for @xmath51 ,",
    "this destructive interference has driven @xmath44 positive , and it is no longer appropriate to think of our state as describing hole pairs moving through an rvb background .",
    "@xcite    similar to the t - j ladder , the difference between @xmath52 and @xmath51 can be attributed to two different internal structures of the hole pairs . for @xmath52",
    "the hole pairs have a @xmath25 structure _ relative _ to the rvb background . for @xmath51",
    "the hole pairs have an @xmath7-wave like symmetry relative to their background .",
    "@xcite    now consider figs .",
    "[ fig : parameters](b ) and [ fig : parameters](c ) .",

    "this shows the importance of the diagonal frustrating bonds for all dopings .",

    "first , we show results for energy per site vs. @xmath11 in fig .  [ fig : energyvsu ] . for comparison , dmrg results are presented for the same set of parameters .",
    "@xcite at half - filling , as we would expect , our ansatz is most accurate for large @xmath11 and large @xmath10 .",
    "the ground state energy per site for a @xmath47 half - filled ladder as a function of @xmath11 for various @xmath10 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyvsu](a ) . for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "the energy from the rva agrees with dmrg to within @xmath57 and improves as @xmath11 or @xmath10 is increased . up to about @xmath58 , longer bonds ( extending over at least 3 rungs ) are coming into play .",
    "these states should be included in the ansatz to further improve the overlap with the ground state . at @xmath59 and @xmath56 ,",
    "our ansatz gives a ground state energy within @xmath60 of the dmrg result .",
    "it should be noted that for the heisenberg ladder , the rvb state gives a ground state energy within @xmath60 of true +    = 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    ground state energy , obtained from dmrg .",
    "@xcite a recent +    = 3.0 in    dmrg study of different ladder models found that the hubbard model and heisenberg model begin to agree only for rather large @xmath11 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is not surprising that the rvb picture becomes as good for the hubbard model as it is for the heisenberg model at @xmath61 .",
    "[ fig : energyvsu](b ) shows the ground state energy of the rva ansatz as a funtion of @xmath11 for various @xmath10 for a doping of @xmath62 on a @xmath47 ladder .",
    "again , we show energies obtained from dmrg for the same set of parameters . for @xmath59 and @xmath63 , the two energies agree to only within @xmath64 and improves slightly as @xmath10 is increased . for example , at @xmath59 and @xmath65 , the overlap of energies increases to @xmath66 .",
    "further discrepancies occur when the doping is increased to @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : energyvsu](c ) ) .",
    "the differences in ground state energies occur due to the importance of `` pair - breaking '' configurations , like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairbreaking ] .",
    "the weights of these types of states increase as we move away from half - filling . consequently , to further improve the rva ansatz , such states must be included in the wave function .",
    "note also that our ansatz would be essentially exact for the case where hole pairs are well localized on a rung . for the @xmath50 model with @xmath68 , pairs are well localized along a rung , and the ground state is essentially a product of rung singlets and rung hole pairs . however , for the hubbard model at strong coupling ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) , this is not the case .",
    "holes would always rather occupy _ adjacent _ rungs , even for @xmath70 , since this minimizes the coulomb energy from doubly occupied sites . to see this consider a @xmath17 plaquette with 2 holes ;",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 . with 1 particle on each rung ( i.e. , one hole on each rung ) ,",
    "the ground state energy is approximately @xmath73 ; with both particles on the same rung ( i.e. , both holes on the same rung ) , the ground state energy is approximately @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , at large u , the particles would rather occupy adjacent rungs .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : adjacent ] . )",
    "the situation we have with the doped ladder is similar to what we had for the half - filled ladder in the early stages of this work .",
    "we found that without the states +    = 2.9 in    = 3.25 in    @xmath75 and @xmath76 which extend over three rungs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : goodstates ] ) , the rva did not accurately reproduce the ground state even at extremely large @xmath11 .",
    "however , once we included @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the results from the rva improved drastically .",
    "based on these results , we expect the rva to greatly improve by including the states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairbreaking ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xeplot1 ] we plot energy per site vs. doping for a @xmath47 ladder for @xmath55 and @xmath59 ( with @xmath63 ) in order to better understand the region of validity of our rva ansatz .",
    "again , we see good agreement with dmrg results at half - filling . however , as soon as we dope , configurations like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairbreaking ] are also important .",
    "it is interesting to note that the idea of hole pairs moving through the rvb background seems to more accurately represent the ground state of the @xmath50 model than the hubbard model . using the well known relation at strong coupling , @xmath77",
    ", the rva agrees to within @xmath78 of the true ground state energy of the @xmath50 ladder for @xmath79 @xmath80 at a doping of @xmath62 .",
    "there are two ways to interpret this ; either the t - j model supports pairing better than the hubbard model , or we must view the hole pairs in the hubbard model as having a larger size ( i.e. larger coherence length . )",
    "to summarize , we applied the recurrent variational approach to the two - leg hubbard ladder .",
    "our results were in qualitative agreement with previous results on the heisenberg and t - j ladders .",
    "for the half - filled ladder , the generalized rvb state became more accurate in the parameter regime where the hubbard and heisenberg ladders were shown to coincide .",
    "however , comparison of the rva with dmrg for the doped ladder indicate that hole - pairs moving through an rvb background is incomplete ; it does not capture the essential physics .",
    "`` pair - breaking '' configurations are also necessary to capture the essential physics .    as we saw , the strength of the rva is the ease in which we could extract the physics .",
    "we were able to see the importance of the configurations in our ansatz quite easily .",
    "furthermore , the rva has a natural way in which to include longer bonds in the ansatz to more accurately represent the groundstate wavefunction .",
    "the importance of such additional states to the physics of the ladder is not easily probed with other techniques .",
    "generalized rvb states similar to ours have been considered previously for the half - filled hubbard ladder .",
    "@xcite fano _ et .",
    "al . _ were even able to produce an ansatz coming within @xmath81 of the true groundstate energy for a ( half - filled ) 2x4 ladder at @xmath59 .",
    "( their ansatz included diagonal bonds of length @xmath82 .",
    ") however , none of these works considered the doped case . using the approach in ref .",
    "17 ( in terms of dimer coverings ) , it appears to be a formidable task to consider doping .",
    "this is one of the strengths of the rva ; doping is handled rather easily .",
    "even though our results for the doped ladder showed that hole pairs moving through an rvb background is incomplete , the rva offers a straightforward way to improve the situation , namely include `` pair - breaking '' configurations ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairbreaking ] ) in the ansatz .",
    "another ( and probably better ) way to improve the situation for the doped ladder is to consider a matrix product ansatz .",
    "@xcite a matrix product ansatz can be generated by first order recursion relations .",
    "@xcite in the rva , the size of the hole - pairs are fixed .",
    "( in our case , the hole pairs had a size of one lattice spacing . )",
    "however , by construction , the matrix product ansatz takes into account hole pairs of _ arbitrary _ size .",
