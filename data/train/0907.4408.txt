    "as particle physics is entering the era of lhc , one may expect direct evidences to be available to establish whether new particles and interactions are present . meanwhile",
    ", high sensitivity studies of low energy phenomena would complement the direct discovery physics at lhc .",
    "the flavor changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) processes , such as @xmath8 transitions , arise only from loop effects within the standard model  ( sm ) , and are therefore very suitable for testing the sm and probing its various extensions .",
    "recently , both cdf and d0 collaborations have announced the measurements of cp violation parameters in @xmath14 system , with the obtained cp - violating phase @xmath15\\,(68\\% { \\rm c. l.})\\quad { \\rm   cdf\\,\\,collaboration}\\,\\cite{cdf}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while within the sm this phase is expected to be @xmath16=-2\\times ( 0.018\\pm0.001)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which deviates from the d0 measurement eq .",
    "( [ d0 ] ) by more than @xmath17 . combining all the available experimental information on @xmath0 mixing ,",
    "the utfit collaboration claims that the divergence of @xmath18 between the experiment measurements and the sm prediction is more than @xmath19  @xcite . taking into account the deviation of @xmath20 in a generic scenario of np",
    ", the ckm - fitter group has found that the sm is disfavored at @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , comparing an updated theoretical predication of @xmath22 mixing with d0  @xcite and cdf  @xcite early results based on @xmath23 data , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have found the mixing phase @xmath17 deviated from the sm expectation .",
    "such a large observed phase , if still persisting in the upcoming experimental measurements , would indicate a signal of new physics  ( np ) manifested in @xmath8 transitions . in the following numerical analyses , we would use the utfit results of @xmath20  @xcite as benchmarks .",
    "motivated by the above observed anomaly , in this paper we shall pursue possible solutions within a family non - universal @xmath1 model  @xcite , which could be naturally derived in certain string constructions  @xcite , @xmath24 models  @xcite and so on .",
    "searching for such an extra @xmath1 boson is an important mission in the experimental programs of tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "performing constraints on the new @xmath1 couplings through low - energy physics is , on the other hand , very important and complementary for direct experimental searches .",
    "it is interesting to note that , within such a specific scenario , both the cp - violating phase problem and the well - known@xmath2 puzzle \" in hadronic @xmath25 decays could be resolved  @xcite . since both the @xmath0 mixing and the @xmath25 decays",
    "involve the same @xmath26 couplings , it is worthwhile to perform a constraint on these couplings with all the available experimental data taken into account simultaneously . at the same time",
    ", we could also get the allowed ranges for flavor - conserving @xmath27 and @xmath28 couplings .",
    "the fcnc @xmath29  ( @xmath30 ) transition , which gives rise to the rare inclusive @xmath31 and the purely leptonic @xmath32 decays , is another important process to probe np . averaging the recent experimental data from babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite and cleo@xcite , the heavy flavor averaging group  ( hfag ) presents the following total branching ratio  @xcite @xmath33 as for the ones in the low ( @xmath34 ) and high ( @xmath35 ) @xmath9 regions , after naively averaging the babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite measurements , we get respectively @xmath36 theoretically , with the up - to - date input parameters , the sm predictions  @xcite for the above three observables are about @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , which agree with the experimental data well .",
    "it implies that such observables in @xmath31 , together with the measurements of @xmath0 mixing and hadronic @xmath25 decays , may provide strict constraints on the new @xmath1 couplings involving the lepton sector .    as for the @xmath7 decay , in addition to the electro - weak loop suppression ,",
    "the decay rate is helicity suppressed in the sm and predicted to be about @xmath40  @xcite , which is still one order of magnitude lower than the cdf upper bound  @xcite @xmath41 it is expected that precise measurements would be available at the upcoming experiments at lhc and super b factories . as a consequence , we shall also investigate the @xmath1 contribution to this decay mode within the parameter spaces constrained by @xmath0 mixing , @xmath25 and @xmath42 decays .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , after a brief review of @xmath43 mixing within the sm , we pursue possible solutions to the @xmath0 mixing anomaly within a family non - universal @xmath1 model , taking into account the constrains from @xmath12 decays  @xcite . in section  3 , the effects of such a np scenario on @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays are investigated in detail .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  4 .",
    "appendix .",
    "a includes all of the theoretical input parameters .",
    "within the sm , the effective hamiltonian @xmath45 for @xmath44 mixing , relevant for scales @xmath46 is given by  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "accurate to next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) in qcd , the off - diagonal term @xmath49 in the neutral b - meson mass matrix is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass of @xmath52 boson , @xmath53 the `` bag '' parameter , and @xmath54 the b - meson decay constant .",
    "explicit expressions for the short - distance qcd correction function @xmath55 and the `` inami - lim '' function @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , could be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently utfit collaboration has performed a model - independent analysis of np effects to @xmath44 mixing in terms of two parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with the following parametrization  @xcite @xmath60 within the sm , the modulus @xmath58 and the phase @xmath59 are predicted to be one and zero , respectively . combining all the available experimental information on @xmath44 mixing , the fitting results at @xmath61 and @xmath62 probabilities from ref .",

    "it could be reduced by @xmath79  ( @xmath81)/@xmath82  ( @xmath83 ) .",

    "is enhanced by about @xmath89 .",
    "more generally , we give up any assumptions for the @xmath1 couplings @xmath90 and @xmath65 .",
    "because of the interference effect between @xmath90 and @xmath65 , the allowed regions for these two parameters are now larger than the ones in case  i and case  ii , which are shown in fig .  [ caseiii ] . from the figure , one can find the correlations between the coupling parameters .",
    "since @xmath91 and its phase have been constrained by @xmath22 mixing , @xmath90 and @xmath65 are found to be small .",
    "it is interesting to note that a model independent constraint on @xmath92 and it phase has been performed in ref.@xcite with @xmath93 . combing our constraints on @xmath91 , @xmath90 and @xmath65 , and re - scaling the combination by @xmath94",
    ", one can find our constraints are in good agreement with the magnitude of @xmath92 in ref.@xcite , but with a much stronger constraint on its phase .",
    "the dependence of @xmath95 and @xmath96 on @xmath90 and @xmath65 has been discussed separately in the last two cases .",
    "so , including all of the theoretical uncertainties , we just present the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and the differential normalized forward - backward asymmetry in fig .",
    "[ figdbabfscaseiii ] .",
    "we find that in s1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figdbabfscaseiii ]  ( a ) , @xmath70 could be either enhanced or reduced by @xmath1 contributions . since the @xmath1 contributions induced by @xmath65 can hardly reduce @xmath68 as discussed in case  ii , the @xmath1 effects for reducing @xmath68 are dominated by @xmath72 as discussed in case  i , while the enhancement is due to both @xmath72 and @xmath65 .",
    "however , in s2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figdbabfscaseiii ]  ( c ) , @xmath68 can hardly be reduced , which confirms our analysis in case .",

    "with both @xmath72 and @xmath65 included , the branching ratio for @xmath13 is affected by @xmath97 .",
    "numerically , with @xmath98 , @xmath99 and the central value of the other theoretical inputs , @xmath100 is reduced by about @xmath101 , which is the same as in case  i. with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and the central value of the other theoretical inputs , we find that @xmath105 , which is about @xmath106 larger than the sm prediction .",
    "so , if the coming measurements at lhcb and super b factories present @xmath107 , the family non - universal @xmath1 model will suffer a serious challenge .",
    "in conclusion , motivated by the observed @xmath0 mixing phase anomaly and the so - called `` @xmath2 puzzle '' , we have studied a family non - universal @xmath1 model to pursue possible solutions . with the constrained @xmath26 coupling by @xmath0 mixing and @xmath25 decays , we focus on the @xmath1 effects on the rare @xmath6  ( including both the high and the low @xmath9 regions ) and the purely leptonic @xmath13 decays ,",
    "both of which are also induced by fcnc @xmath8 transitions .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized as :    * @xmath0 mixing anomaly and `` @xmath2 puzzle '' could be moderated simultaneously within such a family non - universal @xmath1 model .",
    "corresponding to the two fitting results s1 and s2 by utfit collaboration , a new weak phase @xmath3 and @xmath4 are crucial to resolve these two problems . *",
    "similar to the hierarchy of the ckm elements @xmath108 , we find @xmath109  ( @xmath110 ) .",

    "the reduction effects is dominated by the @xmath1 contributions induced by @xmath90 in s1 . and , both the @xmath1 contributions induced by @xmath90 and @xmath115 are helpful to enhance it .",
