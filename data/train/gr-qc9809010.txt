    "recently , as natural alternatives to general relativity , the scalar - tensor theories have been studied by many theoretical physicists . in these theories ,",
    "the gravity is mediated not only by a tensor field but also by a scalar field .",
    "also , such theories have been of interest as effective theories of the string theory at low energy scales @xcite .",
    "several theoretical predictions in the scalar - tensor theories have been obtained ( see e.g. ref.@xcite@xmath0@xcite ) .",
    "it has been found that a wide class of the scalar - tensor theories can pass all the experimental tests in weak gravitational fields .",
    "however , it has also been found that the scalar - tensor theories show different aspects of the gravity in the strong gravitational fields in contrast to general relativity ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown numerically that nonperturbative effects in the scalar - tensor theories increase the maximum mass of an isolated system such as a neutron star [ 2 - 5 ] . in these works ,",
    "numerical methods play an important role , and , in interpreting the numerical results , a static , spherically symmetric vacuum solution ( a spherical exterior solution ) is matched to the numerical solution .",
    "the spherical exterior solution is an analytic exact solution , and , as far as the authors know , only few exact solutions have been known . in particular , the axisymmetric exterior solution corresponding to the kerr solution must be of significant interest .",
    "motivated by this fact , we study series of the stationary solutions with asymptotic flatness properties in the einstein - maxwell - free scalar system because , as summarized in appendix a , they are locally equivalent with the exterior solutions in some class of the scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "the field equations are given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a energy - momentum tensor of the maxwell field ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "in this paper we first classify spherical exterior solutions into two types of the solutions , an apparently black hole type ( abh ) solution and an apparently worm hole type ( awh ) solution .",
    "we then clarify physical significance of the parameters contained in the solutions and show that the abh solution and the awh solution correspond to , respectively , the mass dominant case and the charge dominant case of the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "second , we reduce the field equations for the axisymmetric exterior solutions and show that the reduced equations are partially the same as the ernst equations . as simple examples , we derive new series of static , axisymmetric exterior solutions , which will be referred to as scalar - tensor - weyl solutions .",
    "we then show a non - trivial relation between the spherical exterior solutions and our new solutions .",
    "finally , we study the local geometry of the exterior solutions by using the optical scalar equations and find some anomalous behaviors of the null geodesics .",
    "in this section , we derive static , spherically symmetric exterior solutions with the electric field , which are hereafter referred to as spherical exterior solutions . in the just coordinate ,",

    "<S> we study series of the stationary solutions with asymptotic flatness properties in the einstein - maxwell - free scalar system because they are locally equivalent with the exterior solutions in some class of the scalar - tensor theories of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> first , we classify spherical exterior solutions into two types of the solutions , an apparently black hole type solution and an apparently worm hole type solution . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions contain three parameters , and we clarify their physical significance . </S>",
    "<S> second , we reduce the field equations for the axisymmetric exterior solutions . we find that the reduced equations are partially the same as the ernst equations . as simple examples , </S>",
    "<S> we derive new series of the static , axisymmetric exterior solutions , which correspond to voorhees s solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we then show a non - trivial relation between the spherical exterior solutions and our new solutions . </S>",
