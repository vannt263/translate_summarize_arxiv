    "integrable equations exhibit many extraordinary properties like infinitely many conservation laws , multi- hamiltonian structures , soliton solutions etc .",
    "many integrable equations in 1 + 1 dimensions like kdv , mkdv , harry - dym , boussinesq equations possess interesting conformal properties as well @xcite .",
    "they can be written in terms of the so - called independent conformal invariants of the function @xmath2 :    [ eq1 ] p_1 & = & + p_2 & = & \\{;x}- +    here @xmath3 denotes the schwarz derivative .",
    "a quantity is called conformally invariant if it is invariant under the mbius transformation    [ eq2 ] & & , .",
    "for example , the kdv equation [ eq3 ] u_t+au_xxx+3uu_x=0 ( @xmath4 is a constant ) can be written in a schwarzian form , i.e. in terms of the conformal invariants ( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath5 or    [ eq3b ] + a\\{;x}=0    where    [ eq3a ] u = a\\{;x}.    the kdv and camassa - holm ( ch ) @xcite equations arise also as equations of the geodesic flow for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 metrics correspondingly on the bott - virasoro group @xcite .",
    "the conformal properties of these equations and their link to the bott - virasoro group originate from the hamiltonian operator    [ eq4 ] d_3a^3+u(x ) + u(x )    where @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is also known as the third bol operator @xcite and is the conformally covariant version of the differential operator @xmath10 , see also @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 defines a poisson bracket @xcite    [ eq5 ] \\{f , g}=((a^3+u(x ) + u(x ) ) ) .",
    "dx    and kdv , ch and many other equations @xcite can be written in the form    [ eq6 ] u_t=\\{u , h }    for some hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , suppose for simplicity that @xmath12 is @xmath13 periodic in @xmath14 , i.e.    [ eq7 ] u(x)=^_-l_ne^inx-    then the fourier coefficients @xmath15 close a classical virasoro algebra with respect to the poisson bracket ( [ eq5 ] ) :    [ eq8 ] \\{l_n , l_m}=(n - m)l_n+m+a(n^3-n)_n+m,0    therefore , it is natural to expect that equations which can be written in the form ( [ eq6 ] ) exibit interesting conformal properties , and this is the case indeed @xcite . in what follows we will concentrate on the camassa - holm and the associated camassa - holm equation .",
    "the camassa - holm equation @xcite @xmath16 describes the unidirectional propagation of shallow water waves over a flat bottom @xcite .",
    "ch is a completely integrable equation @xcite , describing permanent and breaking waves @xcite .",
    "its solitary waves are stable solitons @xcite .",
    "ch arises also as an equation of the geodesic flow for the @xmath7 metrics on the bott - virasoro group @xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ eq9 ] ) admits a lax pair @xcite    [ eq10 ] v_xx&=&(-(m+))v + [ eq11 ] v_t&=&-(+u - a)v_x+v    where [ eq12 ] m = u - u_xx .    in order to find the schwarz form for the ch equation we proceed as follows .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be two linearly independent solutions of the system ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) and let us define    [ eq13 ] =    then , from ( [ eq11 ] ) it follows that    [ eq14 ] = -u+(a- )    according to the theorem 10.1.1 from @xcite due to ( [ eq10 ] ) we also have [ eq15 ] \\ { ; x}=2 m + a-    from ( [ eq12 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) we obtain the schwarz - camassa - holm ( s - ch ) equation :    [ eq16 ] ( 1-^2)+\\{;x}=a-    since @xmath19 is an arbitrary constant , one can take @xmath20 ( if @xmath21 ) and then the s - ch equation ( [ eq16 ] ) acquires the form @xmath22 or    [ eq17 ] ( 1-^2)+a\\{;x}=0    applying the hodograph transform    [ eq17a ] x , tt , x    to the s - ch ( [ eq17 ] ) and using the transformation properties of the schwarzian derivative @xcite    [ eq17b ] \\{;x}=-_x^2\\{x ; }    we obtain the following integrable deformation of the harry dym equation for the variable @xmath23 :    [ eq17c ] v_t+v^2[v(v_^-1(v^-1)_t)_]_=av^3v _    the equations ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) with @xmath24 are not equivalent  as a matter of fact ( [ eq17 ] ) implies ( [ eq9 ] ) , cf .",
    "it is often convenient to think that the lax operator belongs to some lie algebra , and the corresponding jost solution- to the corresponding group .",
    "thus the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath25 ( see ( [ eq13 ] ) ) resembles the relation between the lie group and the corresponding lie algebra , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the following proposition holds :    [ p1 ] let @xmath25 be a solution of ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath26 and @xmath27 are solutions of ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) with @xmath28    _ proof _ : it follows easily by a direct computation .",
    "note that the proposition [ p1 ] is consistent with ( [ eq13 ] ) . from proposition [ p1 ]",
    "it follows    the general solution of ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) is [ eq18 ] v= where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two arbitrary constants , not simultaneously zero .",
    "note that the expression ( [ eq18 ] ) is covariant with respect to the mbius transformation ( [ eq2 ] ) , i.e. under ( [ eq2 ] ) , the expression ( [ eq18 ] ) transforms into an expression of the same form but with constants    [ eq19 ] aa=,bb=.",
    "an inverse scattering method , which can be applied directly to the spectral problem ( [ eq10 ] ) is not developed completely yet .",
    "however , the solutions of the ch ( in parametric form ) can be obtained by an implicit change of variables , which maps ( [ eq10 ] ) to the well known spectral problem of the kdv hierarchy .",
    "this change of variables leads to the so - called associated camassa - holm equation ( ach ) @xcite    [ eq20 ] p_t=p^2f _ x , f= ( p)_xt- .    indeed , the ach is related to the ch equation ( [ eq9 ] ) through the following change of variables :    [ eq21 ] p= , f=--    [ eq22 ] dx=p dx+ ( -+)p dt , dt=dt .",
    "in what follows we will omit the dash from the new variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 and we will write simply @xmath14 and @xmath33 instead .    the ach equation ( [ eq20 ] ) is related to the kdv hierarchy @xcite since it may be written in the form    [ eq23 ] u_t=-2p_x , u=- ( )    and the lax pair for ( [ eq23 ] ) is    [ eq24 ] v_xx+(u-)v=0 , + [ eq25 ] v_t=(pv_x - p_xv ) .",
    "the second part of ( [ eq23 ] ) is the ermakov - pinney equation for @xmath34 ( for a known @xmath35 ) @xcite . in order to obtain the schwarzian form of the ach equation",
    ", we introduce again @xmath36 as in ( [ eq13 ] ) , where now @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two linearly independent solutions of the system ( [ eq24 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) . then , by analogous arguments , from ( [ eq24 ] ) it follows    [ eq26 ] u= \\{;x}+ ,    and from ( [ eq25 ] )    [ eq27 ] p=.    using the relation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 given in the first part of ( [ eq23 ] ) , ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) we obtain the schwarz - ach ( s - ach ) equation @xmath37 , or    [ eq28 ] \\{;x}_t+()_x=0 .",
    "now one can easily check by a direct computation the validity of the following    let @xmath25 be a solution of s - ach ( [ eq28 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath26 and @xmath27 are solutions of ( [ eq24 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) with [ eq28a ] p=.    as a corollary we find that the general solution of ( [ eq24 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) , expressed through the solution of ( [ eq28 ] ) is    [ eq29 ] v=    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two arbitrary constants , not simultaneously zero . as we know the expression ( [ eq29 ] )",
    "is covariant under the mbius transformations ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "a transformation , which connects the solution @xmath12 of one equation to the solution @xmath38 of the same ( or another ) equation is called a bcklund transform ( bt ) .",
    "such type of transformations were first discovered in relation to the sine - gordon equation by a. bcklund around 1883 .",
    "usually bt depends on an arbitrary parameter which is called bcklund parameter .    the lax pair ( [ eq24 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) has the following important property @xcite , namely the bt for the ach :    if @xmath39 is a solution of the lax pair ( [ eq24 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) with potentials @xmath35 and @xmath34 , then @xmath40 is a solution of ( [ eq24 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) with potentials    [ eq30 ] & = & u+2(v)_xx , + [ eq31 ] & = & p-(v)_xt .    from ( [ eq29 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) it now follows that the bt for the solution ( [ eq28a ] ) of the ach equation can be expressed through the solution of the s - ach equation as follows :    [ eq32 ] = -()_xt .",
    "since the constants @xmath29 , @xmath30 are not simultaneously zero , one can always factor out one of the two constants , i.e. ( [ eq32 ] ) obviously depends only on the ratio of these two constants ( which is the bcklund parameter in this case ) .",
    "we conclude this section with the following remark for the kdv equation .",
    "it is not difficult to see through similar considerations , that the bcklund transform for the solution ( [ eq3a ] ) of the kdv equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is [ eq33a ] = a\\{;x}+4a ( ) _ xx ,    where @xmath25 is the solution of the s - kdv equation ( [ eq3b ] ) .",
    "then the choice @xmath41 in ( [ eq33a ] ) corresponds to the exotic bcklund transform found by galas in @xcite and mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the ach and s - ach equations can be constructed , following the scheme for the construction of the solutions of the kdv hierarchy @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 be @xmath43 different solutions of the lax pair ( [ eq24 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) with potentials @xmath35 and @xmath34 , taken at @xmath44 respectively and let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be two linearly independent solutions for some value @xmath19 .",
    "consider the wronskian determinants    w&=&w(v_1,v_1;1 ,  , v_1;m_1 , v_2 , v_2;1 , ",
    ", v_2;m_2 ,  , v_n , v_n;1 ,  , v_n;m_n ) + w_k&= & w(v_1,v_1;1 ,  , v_1;m_1 ,  , v_n , v_n;1 ,  , v_n;m_n ,",
    "v_k ) , k=1,2 , + [ eq33 ]    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 are arbitrary nonnegative integers and the wronskian determinant of @xmath47 functions @xmath48 is defined by    [ eq34 ] w(_1 , _ 2,  _n)=a , a_ij= , i , j=1,2,  ,n .",
    "the following generalization of the crum theorem is valid for the kdv hierarchy and in particular for the ach equation @xcite :    [ p4 ] @xmath49 , @xmath50 are two linearly independent solutions of the lax pair ( [ eq24 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) with potentials [ eq35 ] & = & u+2(w)_xx , + [ eq36 ] & = & p-(w)_xt",
    ".    from proposition [ p4 ] it follows immediately that [ eq37 ] = = , = are the solutions of the s - ach ( [ eq28 ] ) , which correspond to the potentials = , p=.    in addition to the solutions mentioned in @xcite one may construct also the so - called negaton and positon solutions ( which are singular ) and mixed soliton - positon - negaton solutions . for a detailed discussion on the positon and negaton solutions of kdv",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "let us return to ( [ eq24 ] ) with @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52",
    ". then it has the form    [ eq280 ] v_xx+e(h,)v=0 , e(h,)=-(+ ) .",
    "the type of the solutions of ( [ eq280 ] ) clearly depends on the sign of the constant @xmath53 . if @xmath54 the independent solutions of ( [ eq280 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) are    [ eq281 ] v_1 ( ) & = & ( ( x - ht+x_1 ( ) ) ) , + [ eq282]v_2 ( ) & = & ( ( x - ht+x_2 ( ) ) ) ,    where @xmath55 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the simplest choice for @xmath56 in ( [ eq35 ] ) , ( [ eq36 ] ) is @xmath57 or @xmath58 ( wronskian of order one ) , which corresponds to the _ one - soliton solution_. the case @xmath59 corresponds to the _ two - soliton solution _ , i.e. this solution describes the interaction of two solitons .",
    "however , according to ( [ eq33 ] ) it is possible to merge two or more identical solitons , taking    [ eq283 ] w&=&w(v_1,v_1;1 ,  , v_1;m_1 ) ,    or [ eq284 ] w&= & w(v_2,v_2;1 ,  , v_2;m_2 ) .    in physical terms @xmath53",
    "is the energy of the soliton .",
    "since the energy of the solitons is negative , ( [ eq283 ] ) is called _ negaton _ of type @xmath60 and order @xmath61 , and ( [ eq284 ] ) is called _ negaton _ of type @xmath62 and order @xmath63 , cf .",
    "the analogous considerations resulting from the following solutions of ( [ eq280 ] ) ,    [ eq285 ] v_1 ( ) & = & ( ( x - ht+x_1 ( ) ) ) , + [ eq286]v_2 ( ) & = & ( ( x - ht+x_2 ( ) ) )    ( @xmath64 ) , whose energy is positive , @xmath65 leads naturally to the definition of _ positon _ of type @xmath60 and order @xmath61 via ( [ eq283 ] ) and ( [ eq36 ] ) , and _ positon _ of type @xmath62 and order @xmath63 , ( [ eq284 ] ) and ( [ eq36 ] ) ; cf . @xcite .    due to ( [ eq33 ] ) it is possible to construct solutions , which describe the interaction between solitons , positons and negatons .",
