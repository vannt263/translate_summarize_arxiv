    "the perturbation theory of this paper will be combined with monte carlo calculations of the quarkonium and heavy - light spectrum , to determine @xmath2 masses @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in forthcoming publications  @xcite .",
    "the objective of this section is to derive relations for mass and wave - function renormalization , for arbitrary values of  @xmath4 .",
    "to do so , we shall assume only properties guaranteed in the lattice theory , and we shall not assume that the self energy is small . by assuming less , we obtain more : our derivation succeeds not only for arbitrary mass , but to all orders in perturbation theory as well .",
    "an outline of our analysis is as follows : we start by anticipating the physical content of the quark propagator , viewed as a function of three - momentum and time .",
    "this provides a template from which one can read off the energy , as a function of three - momentum , and the wave - function renormalization factor .",
    "we next write down a description of the free propagator and the self energy , as functions of the four - momentum , constrained only by symmetry and periodicity .",
    "the description applies to all lattice theories with wilson s discretization in time  @xcite .",
    "this includes the wilson action  @xcite ( of course ) , the improvements of ref .",
    "@xcite and of ref .",
    "@xcite , and some nonrelativistic actions .",
    "then we fourier transform the full propagator from four - momentum to time and three - momentum .",
    "the result is a sum of terms , one for each pole in the momentum - space propagator . finally , we focus on the pole corresponding to the one - quark state , and read off the energy and wave - function renormalization factor from the template anticipated at the outset",
    ".    in our analysis it is unnecessary to assume that the three - momentum , the mass , or even the self energy itself , is small .",
    "indeed , the notion of a perturbation arises only to separate the inverse full propagator into a free part plus a self energy and to identify a one - quark state in the interacting theory .",
    "thus , our results for the pole are valid not only for all masses but also to all orders in the gauge interaction .",
    "( they are not nonperturbative , because quark and gluon states have meaning , in nonabelian gauge theories , only within perturbation theory . ) specializing to small three - momenta ( in lattice units ) , we obtain the three main results of this section : all - orders formulae for the rest mass ( sec .",
    "[ rm ] ) , the kinetic mass ( sec .  [ km ] ) , and the wave - function renormalization factor ( sec .  [ wfr ] ) .",
    "in subsequent sections , we specialize further , first to expressions for the one - loop self energy for the action given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later to numerical results for the wilson and sheikholeslami - wohlert actions .",
    "because of confinement , the true states of qcd are hadrons , not quarks and gluons . in perturbation theory , however , one may pretend that quark and gluon states exist .",
    "although the aim of this section is to relate the bare mass of lattice qcd to the perturbative pole mass , one should always view the pole mass as an intermediate step . in a final application",
    ", the pole mass should be related to another regulator mass , such as the @xmath2 mass , or to a genuine ( hadronic ) observable .",
    "mindful of the preceding caution , we proceed as if quarks and gluons are physical states .",
    "the starting point is the quark two - point correlation function @xmath18 which defines  @xmath19 .",
    "the fields are those appearing in the functional integral : they are bare fields , in a fixed gauge chosen so that @xmath20 does not vanish trivially .",
    "the field  @xmath21 can create from the vacuum not just the one - quark state , but also states with extra gluons or extra @xmath22 pairs .",
    "one thus anticipates @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the energy of the one - quark state with momentum  @xmath25 , and  @xmath26 the energy of states with a quark and a gluon .",
    "( the quark - gluon states and the multi - particle states denoted by the ellipsis will not concern us further . )",
    "if the @xmath27 matrix @xmath28 is normalized according to the condition given in sec .",
    "[ wfr ] , then the residue  @xmath29 is the square of the amplitude for the bare field to create a physical one - quark state .    with a euclidean invariant cutoff",
    "the energy would satisfy @xmath30 , where  @xmath31 is the quark s `` pole '' mass . with a lattice cutoff ,",
    "on the other hand , the mass shell is distorted . to describe the distorted pole position in a systematic way",

    "it is thus a constant independent of  @xmath25 ; it is the wave - function renormalization factor  @xmath41 . with a lattice cutoff ,",
    "however , the @xmath25  dependence does not drop out of the residue , even on shell .",
    "a reasonable definition of the wave - function renormalization factor is the residue at vanishing three - momentum @xmath42 then @xmath43 creates the one - quark state with conventional ( unit ) normalization , at least for momenta much lower than the ultraviolet cutoff .    to obtain perturbative expressions for  @xmath24 and  @xmath29 ,",
