    "accretion takes place through an accretion disc which encircles the compact object and regulates the flow of material onto it making these objects the brightest x - ray sources in the sky .",

    ", one can determine the mass function of the system , which represents a minimum mass for the accreting compact object .",
    "this experiment can be best applied to a subclass of lmxbs , the so called x - ray transients ( xts ) , in which x - ray activity occurs only during well - defined outburst episodes . between outbursts ,",

    "+ the distribution of black hole masses can only be determined from the study of x - ray binaries ( eg . , * ? ? ? * ) and it is intricately related to the population and evolution of massive stars , the energetics and dynamics of supernova explosions , and the critical mass dividing neutron stars and black holes .",
    "several attempts to extract statistical information from the observed mass distribution have been made @xcite , however , the small number of black holes prevents us from extracting very compelling conclusions . about @xmath510@xmath14 - 10@xmath15 stellar  mass black holes",

    "+ the best place to look for black holes are xts , which are detected in outburst by x - ray all - sky monitors .",
    "this was the case of ky tra , a _ historical _ x - ray transient discovered in 1974 by the ariel v instruments @xcite . after a short precursor , ky tra reached an outburst peak flux of 0.9crab in the 3 - 6kev band , before decaying with an e - folding time of about 2 months @xcite .",
    "the source also showed a low intensity outburst in 1990 which was significantly fainter than the discovery 1974 outburst @xcite .",
    "six months later , an upper limit to the quiescent x - ray luminosity of @xmath52 - 10@xmath1810@xmath19ergs@xmath9 was derived .",
    "the ultrasoft x - ray spectrum seen by ariel v and the hard tail observed by sigma @xcite strongly suggests that ky tra is a black hole candidate .",
    "the optical counterpart was identified 12 days after the x - ray maximum of the 1974 outburst at @xmath20=17.5 @xcite .",

    "photometric error estimates on the magnitudes are based on a combination of poisson statistics and the error contribution of the stars used for calibration . these magnitudes",
    ", however , correspond to the transient blended with the interloper ( see section [ astrometry ] ) so they need to be corrected taking this into account .",
    "to do so , we cleaned the contribution of the contaminant component by subtracting its best psf fit .",
    "the initial centers for fitting the profiles of the components were determined by visual inspection of the @xmath2 image , where they are more clear .",
    "the two components of the blend have approximately equal brightness : we calculated @xmath2=21.47@xmath60.09 , @xmath3=22.3@xmath60.1 and v= 23.6@xmath60.1 for the top component , which is the xt counterpart as suggested by the @xmath7 image .",

    "@xcite report a reddening e(b - v)@xmath310.5 .",
    "an estimation of the interstellar reddening for any sky region can be obtained from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive .",
    "the reddening quoted for the field of ky tra , e(b - v)=0.7 , implies a corrected @xmath32=0.77 and @xmath33=1.15 consistent with a @xmath5k0 - 2v companion .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that this is likely an upper limit to the true spectral type of the donor star because we have neglected any contribution from a residual accretion disc into the observed colour .",
    "the limited seeing conditions prevents us from deblending the flux of the two stars in every single image .",
    "therefore , we studied the variability of ky tra by integrating the total flux of the blend from the series of images in the @xmath2-band in the two different epochs : in 2004 may with less than one hour of observations and in 2007 june 16 and 17 with about 6 hours coverage .",
    "the 2004 images were obtained during twilight so photometry accuracy was dominated by a bright sky level .",
    "unfortunately on 2007 june 16 we were affected by poor weather conditions with variable transparency caused by clouds . on 2007 june 17 no clouds were present although sky transparency was not ideal . in this night",
    "we get @xmath57% photometry for a 21.5 magnitude star . in summary",
    ", we found that the target is not variable above the error levels in any of our nights ( i.e. , @xmath34=0.07 , 0.14 and 0.07mags for 2004 may and 2007 june 16 and 17 respectively ) .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig.[figure : variability ] where we plot the scatter in the observed magnitudes .",
    "the scatter around the mean magnitude of ky tra ( marked with a circle in fig.[figure : variability ] ) is consistent with that displayed by the field stars of similar mean brightness .",
    "note that the presence of the interloper dilutes the orbital modulation of ky tra , which would explain the lack of photometric variability on our images . because the interloper contributes around half of the total flux",
    ", we can only conclude that the target is not variable by @xmath350.15mags .",
    "+ after re - scaling the zero - point of each night we found that the total flux remains stable at @xmath2=20.88@xmath60.01 ( @xmath2=21.47@xmath60.09 for ky tra , i.e. the top component of the blend ) in our entire dataset , from 2004 until 2007 .",

    "although very noisy , our spectrum shows the h@xmath0 emission line characteristic of x - ray transients in quiescence .",
    "we obtained its full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) from a gaussian fit of the continuum rectified spectrum within the range @xmath610000km / s , centered on the h@xmath0 line .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : ha_gaussian ] . after subtracting quadratically the instrumental resolution",
    "we find fwhm=2700@xmath6280km / s where the error is the formal 1-@xmath34 on the fitted parameter as derived through @xmath36 minimization .",
    "we note that the quoted error is within the typical 10% standard deviation caused by intrinsic line variability and therefore we take this as realistic @xcite .",
    "we also extracted the equivalent width ( ew ) by integrating the h@xmath0 flux after continuum normalization and find @xmath37 .",
    "note , however , that this value is diluted by the extra continuum of the interloper and hence the true ew of ky tra is underestimated by a factor  2 .",
    "although ky tra is a very promising black hole candidate , it had not been studied in the optical band since its discovery in 1974 .",
    "we have observed ky tra in quiescence and confirmed its identification .",
    "the finding chart we present will certainly be helpful in performing observations with eelt - class telescopes in order to obtain dynamical information on the mass of the compact object .",
    "+ a rough estimate of the period can be made by combining the @xcite expression for the averaged radius of a roche lobe with kepler s third law to get the well - known relationship between the secondary s mean density and the orbital period : @xmath38g@xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mean density and @xmath41 the orbital period in hours . under the hypothesis that the light of ky tra is contaminated by the interloper , we calculate an orbital period of about 8h assuming a k0v star .",
    "it should be noted that this is likely an upper limit since , as we pointed out in sect .",
    "4.1 , we have neglected any residual contribution from an accretion disc to the colour of ky tra . an independent estimation can be made using the empirical relation @xmath42 which predicts the orbital period of xts with orbital periods less than 1day given only its visual outburst amplitude @xmath43 @xcite . during outburst ,",
    "optical emission is dominated by the reprocessing of the x - rays in the accretion disc where most of the reprocessed energy is radiated in the ultraviolet . according to the irradiated model predictions @xmath440 @xcite resulting in @xmath4517.5 at the outburst peak @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath4=23.6 in quiescence , the total outburst amplitude is @xmath56.1mag so this would lead to an orbital period of about 12hours .",
    "we can place a robust upper limit for the period of about 15h corresponding to a minimum outburst amplitude if the source were not contaminated by any interloper . + after analyzing the h@xmath0 emission profiles of 12 dynamically confirmed black holes and 2 neutron star x - ray transients ( xts ) in quiescence ,",
    "@xcite has found a tight correlation between the fwhm of the h@xmath0 line and the velocity semi - amplitude of the donor star , where k@xmath10=0.233(13)@xmath18fwhm .",
    "we have applied this relation to ky tra and predict k@xmath10=630@xmath674km",
    "this can be combined with our rough estimates of the orbital period to infer the mass function @xmath46 of the binary .",
    "our upper limit @xmath47h implies @xmath48 m@xmath12 while @xmath49h would lead to @xmath50 m@xmath12 .",
    "more accurate constraints require an accurate determination of the orbital period . + despite the foregoing , no variability has been found above the error levels , i.e. @xmath50.07mags , indicating that we may be looking at the binary at very low inclination .",
    "however , given the contaminating flux from an interloper , the variability would be diluted to the extent that any intrinsic variability above @xmath50.15mag would not be detectable given our error levels , and so the inclination might not be as low .",
    "interestingly , ky tra has one of the broadest h@xmath0 lines among sxts ( a summary of the parameters of the xts can be found in @xcite table 3 ) , suggesting that , if ky tra is viewed at low inclination , it must have a very short orbital period .",
    "some clues about the inclination are provided by the ew of the h@xmath0 line , since it depends on the binary geometry .",
    "the ew tends to increase with inclination because , when the disc is seen at large inclinations , its continuum brightness decreases .",
    "an interesting exercise is to locate ky tra in the ew  fwhm diagram shown in figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "regions of constant inclination and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the mass of the compact object and @xmath53 is the orbital period , are defined in the diagram .",
    "both the relatively large ew and the high @xmath51 factor are reminiscent of xte j1118 + 480 and suggest that ky tra also hosts a black hole seen at moderately high inclination .",
    "furthermore , we point out that given the contaminating flux from an interloper , the observed @xmath54 would just be a lower limit to the true @xmath54 since the latter would be diluted by the excess continuum .",
    "clearly , more higher quality photometry is necessary to resolve these issues and draw further firm conclusions .",
