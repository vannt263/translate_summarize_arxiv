    "several key questions of modern astrophysics regarding the formation and evolution of the milky way will be clarified with the next space astrometry mission gaia , approved in 2000 as a cornerstone within the european space agency science program  @xcite . the mission is now funded and will enter in the c / d phase in 2006 for a launch scheduled in late-2011 and nominal operations over the next five years .",
    "thanks to its high precision ( 10 @xmath2arcsecond in angular measurements ) and multi - epoch astrometry , gaia will be able to detect the relative positional change of a star resulting for the tiny curvature of the light ray brought about by the gravitational pull of the sun , and to a lesser extent by the giant planets .    as far as the light deflection produced by the solar mass is concerned",
    ", the science case has included from the outset an investigation of the value of the ppn parameter @xmath0 , considered as a global unknown in the astrometric model .",
    "this parameter , equal to one in general relativity ( gr ) , indicates the amount of space - time curvature produced by a unit rest - mass and it is a fundamental part of the so called parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism  @xcite , originally developed by eddington for the famous experiment during the solar eclipse in 1919 .",
    "the ppn method aims to quantify the violations of the equivalence principle by parameterizing deviations which modify both local physical laws and large - scale gravitational phenomena , including the constancy of the constants .",
    "ppn formalism is valid for a broad class of metric theories and includes gr as a reference case , _",
    "i.e. _ as a current standard theory of gravitation . the slow motion and weak field limit allows to use ppn metric expansion as a function of several parameters , varying from theory to theory , useful to discern gravitational experiments in the solar system .",
    "the ppn parameter @xmath0 is the most important , since all the other parameters to all relativistic order within the alternative theories to gravity , converge to their gr value in proportion to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the most general formulation of these theories contains an arbitrary function of a scalar field coupled to the stress - energy tensor in order to merge quantum mechanics with gravity .",
    "recent works on scalar - tensorial theories consistent with various cosmological scenarios suggest the search for discrepancies from unity of @xmath0 at the levels of @xmath4 to @xmath5 ; more precisely , damour and nordtvedt  @xcite assume that there exist a cosmological attractor mechanism towards gr quantified from deviation of @xmath0 from unity within the above level of accuracy depending on the total mass density of the universe .",
    "then , an experiment purposely designed could reveal the coexistence of the two mentioned fields throughout the cosmological evolution up to the present where pure tensor gravity explains the gravitational interaction from small to large scale .",
    "in addition , some dynamical models predict scalar fields dominating the current energy density of the universe , which should contribute to the value of @xmath0 at the level of @xmath5 to @xmath6 , thus providing a universe evolution without the need of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "all this issues make precision tests of gravity in space a fascinating challenge for the next decades , as in the past the eddington s observations in 1919 of star line - of - sight did , confirming the amount of 172 as deflection angle predicted by gr .",
    "nowadays , all present experimental tests are compatible with the predictions of gr . in particular , experiments conducted in solar system have tested all the weak - field predictions of gr theory at better than the @xmath7 level and down to @xmath8 level for @xmath0 as seen from the additional doppler shift in radio - wave beams connecting the earth to the cassini spacecraft when they passed near the sun  @xcite .",
    "new space projects will go deeper in experimental gravitation .",
    "the nasa gravity probe b mission  @xcite , whose first results are expected very soon , should directly measure @xmath0 to better than the @xmath4 level , although this is not the main objective of the experiment and remains subjected to efficient instrumental calibrations .",
    "an early analysis of the gaia s capabilities , indicates that its measurements should provide a precision of @xmath9 for this parameter  @xcite , an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude to the current best estimate mentioned above .",
    "this is quite comparable to the expectations of the lator project  @xcite , which is designed to use two optical interferometers between two micro - spacecrafts and aims to determine @xmath3 at the level of @xmath10 .    besides the determination of @xmath0 based on the global astrometry capabilities of gaia",
    ", the mission will also allow to carry out dedicated small field experiments from the observations performed close to the surface of a giant planet like jupiter or saturn .",
    "the light bending due to their gravitational field will be detectable in the visible and we show in this paper that even the quadrupole field of jupiter will be evidenced in such an experiment .",
    "it is therefore possible to carry out the same kind of eclipse experiment made by dyson , eddington , and davidson in 1920 , but now by comparing stellar positions in the immediate vicinity of the planets .",
    "not only will this experiment be a further confirmation of a gr prediction , but it will also help understand the very difficult question of the light - bending by a moving source and that of the propagation of gravitation .    using jupiter to test gr ,",
    "kopeikin and fomalont claimed they have determined the speed of gravity trough the vlbi   astrometric measurement of shapiro time delay of light from the quasar j0842 + 1835 , as its image passed within 3.7 arcmin of the planet ( about 10 jupiter radii , a far cry from what gaia can achieve )  @xcite . according to",
    "the post - minkowskian formalism assumed  @xcite , the gravitational field due to a moving body propagates with finite speed ; consequently , it influences a photon with some retardation .",
    "the speed of gravity enters as an extra tiny velocity - dependent corrections to the shapiro time delay formula of the order of 4.8 ps . at present",
    "there is no general consensus on the results , especially upon the method to extend gr to the case where the velocity of gravity differs from the velocity of light  @xcite .",
    "in particular , given the observed limits on @xmath0 , the fomalont - kopeikin measurements are not accurate enough yet to determine the speed of gravity  @xcite . some authors interpret the result within the lorentz transformation properties of the weak gravitational field and consider it as a violation not only of the lorentz invariance but also of the galilean one  @xcite .",
    "paper  @xcite settles the significance of the jupiter experiment as a simply standard aberration of light which propagates across an active medium with an effective index of refraction induced by the gravitational field of a lens in motion : the tiny corrections to the shapiro time delay should be included into the fitting of microlensing events .",
    "however , even if there is still a controversy about the question of whether the results depend on the speed of gravity  @xcite or on the abberation of light  @xcite , there is a general agreement that this measurement is a remarkable precise vlbi detection of a post - newtonian effect due to a planet .",
    "the possibility to apply methods of relativistic astrometry to test gr has prompted several groups to model highly accurate angular observations in the relativistic framework .",
    "new formalisms have been proposed (  @xcite and reference therein ) to tackle the relativistic problem of the light path reconstruction , which , at least at the @xmath2as accuracy , implies taking into account all the contributions not only due to the bulk mass of the solar system bodies , but also to their quadrupole moment and to the time - dependent gravitational field generated by their motions ( see ) .",

    "the former is based on a mathematical solution of geodesic equation whereby mathematical expressions for the light deflection in any order of multipole perturbations are obtained . in the second paper , this contribution stems from the prior computation of the time transfer function between two point located at a finite distance .",
    "however neither approach has provided hints on how to apply the intricate formulas to a practical case like the one faced in the gaia modelling .",
    "having in mind the capabilities of gaia to observe stellar sources very close to jupiter s limb ( at a fraction of the planet radius ) , we have evaluated the light deflection produced by an oblate planet on grazing photons coming from distant stars .",
    "this study is part of a wider project called gaia relativistic experiment ( garex ) , which aims to investigate all possibilities to test gr with gaia measurements . in the solar system",
    ", this mission will mainly carry out :    * light deflection experiments , divided into ( i ) global astrometry , in particular highly accurate determinations of @xmath0 by observing the change in star position at different angular distance to the sun ; ( ii ) small field experiments , with the examination of the light propagation by means of differential measurements of stellar positions near the planets ; * perihelion precession effect , related to the determinations of ppn parameter @xmath35 measures the non - linearity in the superposition of gravitational fields . ] from the orbit fitting of several thousands minor bodies  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the case of the light bending by jupiter at the microarcsecond level and its detection by the small field astrometric observations with gaia . in  @xcite",
    "we have already explored the favorable circumstances for gaia in five years of continuous observations , approximately from 2012 to 2017 , to detect the quadrupole light bending effect predicted by gr , but never observed . for jupiter",
    "the magnitude of the monopole deflection for a grazing ray is @xmath36 milliarcsecond , to which a component from the quadrupole moment is superimposed with an amplitude of @xmath37 micro - arcsecond , as showed in .",
    "this secondary deflection has a very specific pattern as a function of ( i ) the position of the star with respect to the oblate deflector and ( ii ) the orientation of its spin axis . in",
    "we derive the relevant formulas to express this light bending effect using the ppn formalism at large and small angle from the planet . in",
    "we describe all the steps needed to simulate the small field experiment when observing stellar background in vicinity of jupiter .",
    "finally , in , we discuss the data processing of a set of montecarlo runs and the results in the determination of the ppn parameter @xmath0 and the quadrupole effect from jupiter .",
    "most stellar sources , planets and observers have a small velocity compared to the velocity of the light and a weak inter - body gravitational field exists inside bound systems .",
    "moreover , if we consider isolated distribution of matter , the geometry can be assumed minkowskian , asymptotically flat far away  @xcite .",
    "let us consider , then , a set of ppn coordinates @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and a solar system locally perturbed by isolated stationary axisymmetric masses . to the post - newtonian ( pn ) accuracy , the spatial part of the geodesic equation of a light ray coming form a distant star can be easily transformed into  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the newtonian potential ( in geometrized units ) and @xmath43 its partial derivative with respect to the spatial coordinates .",

    "@xmath46 then , by decomposing @xmath45 into two components , parallel ( @xmath47 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath48 ) to @xmath44 , equation becomes @xmath49= ( 1+\\gamma ) \\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\bot}u,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the unit tangent vector on the unperturbed light path in the direction of the observer . here",
    "the symbol @xmath51 indicates the derivative perpendicular to the light ray , assumed to pass outside the matter distribution .",
    "placing the origin of coordinates @xmath52 at the center of an axisymmetric planet , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 considered as its axis of maximum moment of inertia , located between the star and the observer , the positional vector of the photon with respect to the principal axes centered at the planet can be expressed as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the length of the light path and @xmath56 the radial direction perpendicular to the unperturbed ray pointing towards the center of gravity , along the impact parameter @xmath57 .",

    "light deflection by a planet : tangent plane on the sky .",
    "the position of the star is displaced both in the radial ( -@xmath56 ) and orthoradial @xmath67 directions .",
    "the spin axis of the planet @xmath53 ( not shown here ) does not lie in this plane in general . ]",
    "the length @xmath55 of the photon path can be scaled by the impact parameter into a dimensionless parameter as follows @xmath69 so the radial distance becomes @xmath70 each integral entering   must be computed with @xmath71 running positively in the same direction as the photon from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , with @xmath68 standing for the angular separation between the directions star / observer and observer / planet ( ) . at the closest approach on the unperturbed ray one",
    "has @xmath74 .",
    "the explicit expressions of the integrals are given in appendix a. after some algebra , the light deflection vector is split into two components , the first one along @xmath56 and the second one along @xmath75 , both including the monopole and the quadrupole contribution of the planet in function of the angular separation @xmath68 : @xmath76 where , precisely , @xmath77\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath78 .",
    "\\label{defqu2-chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the radial component ( that along @xmath56 ) is the classical monopole deflection , widely used in astronomy .",
    "all the other terms factored by @xmath64 come from the quadrupole of the planet .",
    "one can specialize these expressions to near - grazing rays as , unlike with the solar deflection , the effect is too small to be observed at large angle from the planet .",
    "hence when @xmath79 this leads to the more convenient and accurate enough formulas , @xmath80 \\label{defqu1}\\ ] ] @xmath81 which are similar to a derivation obtained in  @xcite in the case of the sun .",
    "the deflection vector depends on the orientation of the spin axis of the planet and , moreover , on the direction of the star with respect to the planet as seen in the terms proportional to @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in general",
    "the quadrupole deflection vector depends both on the impact parameter and on the direction of the light source with respect to the spin axis projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "however , for a given impact parameter , its modulus depends only on the star s direction with respect to the planet s reference frame .",
    "this property is established in appendix b and has been used thoroughly to as an additional check to the computer implementation of the simulation ( see ) .",
    "one should note that the above formulation has left aside and neglected refinements in the modelling like the motion of jupiter , the retarded effect on the light propagation and mulipolar terms of higher orders in the potential expansion .",
    "considering @xmath84 is equivalent to saying that equations  - constitute the reference modelling in the standard gr .",
    "therefore , in the same way as one introduces @xmath0 in the monopole deflection to characterize departures from gr , we multiply @xmath85 by a dimensionless parameter @xmath86 whose value is 0 if no effect is seen ( say this may correspond to a lack of coupling between gravity and electromagnetism seen in the multipole moments ) and 1 for the standard gr . hereafter we call this parameter the quadrupole efficiency factor ( qef ) and the goal is to see whether it is significantly determined from the gaia observations .",
    "although @xmath86 is not a ppn parameters , it represents the first level of a post - newtonian test whose goal is to determine whether the effect is detected,_i.e .",
    "_ if one can say that @xmath86 is equal to unity , with a certain uncertainty .",
    "thus , for the processing of the experiment of light deflection near the planet , we adopt the following formulation , @xmath87 \\label{defqu1-gam - eps}\\ ] ]    @xmath88    including the two unknowns @xmath0 and @xmath86 , which are equal to @xmath89 in the simulation .",
    "the one garex experiment we consider in this paper is a light deflection in the vicinity of jupiter .",
    "the goal is to measure in a fully independent way the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath86 expressed in light deflection formulae   and  , together with their associated errors , knowing the astrometric accuracy that will be achieved by gaia .",
    "as @xmath85 is well known from space probe tracking with a precision better than @xmath4 , we will here consider it as a constant , and infer instead an estimate of the qef factor @xmath86 .",
    "first , we have investigated what are the favorable circumstances to perform experiments using jupiter during the mission lifetime  @xcite .",
    "this depends on the number of times jupiter will cross one of the astrometric fields during the mission and on the stellar density in its immediate surroundings during these observations . at present , the details of the former can only be known statistically , as the precise initial conditions of the sky scanning law remain unknown . on the other hand",
    "the sky background can be assessed with more certainty as it depends only on the motion of jupiter between 2012 and 2018 , and not very accurately on when the observations take place , provided they are reasonably scattered during the observing period .",
    "the ephemerides of jupiter have been computed in galactic coordinates between these two epochs for an observer orbiting the sun - earth l2 in the same way as gaia will do .",
    "the observability conditions are shown in   with the visibility periods when the angular distance to the sun makes the observations feasible with gaia ( no observations can be made around conjunctions and oppositions ) .",
    "galactic coordinates are used just because the primary dependence of the stellar density is on the galactic latitude .",
    "mean number of stars per square degree down to the magnitude limit v=20 in the field of jupiter during the gaia operations .",
    "the dashed lines represent the period when jupiter crosses the galactic plane and the central one the epoch when the maximum number of stars is observed . ]",
    "we have chosen the date 2012 as the beginning of the simulations , since gaia will take at least six months to be operational at the lagrangian point l2 of the earth - moon - sun system .",
    "jupiter will cross the galactic plane in mid-2013 and , consequently , we expect favorable observations of the planet in front of a dense stellar background as shown in  .",
    "the plot gives the average number of stars per square degree around jupiter from 2012 to 2018 as seen from gaia .",
    "the principle of the simulated experiment is to generate a series of pairs of observations over the mission length of 5 years , so that in each pair jupiter is , or is not , at the center of the stellar field . in both cases astrometric observations similar to that expected from gaia",
    "are computer generated , with the proper noise function of the star brightness .",
    "the number of stars simulated in each field is determined by the galactic latitude of jupiter at the observation time .",
    "then the two star patterns are compared and the differences in along - scan positions ( the only direction of accurate measurements with gaia ) are fitted to the model with the two unknowns @xmath0 and @xmath86 .",
    "this is an idealized version of the gaia procedure as the two fields ( with or without jupiter ) will not be observed exactly a the same time , leading to correction for the relative orientations of the fields and for the proper motion of the stars .",
    "but these are technical details that will be carefully handled during the data processing and have no impact on the feasibility study demonstrated in this paper .",
    "the numerical parameters used in the simulation are listed in .",

    "given the galactic coordinates @xmath96 of jupiter we extracted the relevant stellar density in the magnitude range @xmath97 from a realistic galactic model based in actual star counts fitted to convenient mathematical expressions as a function of the galactic latitude and longitude .",
    "the magnitude range is determined by the rejection of saturated stars ( brighter than v=12.0 ) on the bright side and by keeping stars observable with gaia with a reasonable astrometric accuracy on the faint side .",
    "one must keep in mind that the number of close approaches between jupiter and stars brighter than @xmath98 will be a rare event , albeit very important in this context , but not liable to statistical treatment .",
    "it must be handled on a case by case basis with a real sky and this will be done later when the final parameters of the scanning law are known . after having computed the number of stars per interval of 0.5 magnitude inside the field of view at each observational epoch",
    ", we generated the observed stars in the field of view .",
    "for the fields with jupiter we have computed the proper stellar directions by taking into account the full deflection due to the monopole and the quadrupole .",
    "then for any pair and any epoch we have added a gaussian noise in both coordinates .",

    "the interest rests not only on the accuracy achieved ( the global astrometry should reach four orders of magnitude better with solar light - bending ) , but on the fact that ( i ) it can be done with a planet , ( ii ) it is a prerequisite to the detection of the quadrupole effect in the residuals , ( iii ) it opens the way for testing the accurate modelling of the deflection by a moving body ( it is stationary in our experiments ) .",
