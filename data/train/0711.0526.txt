    "the phenomenon of subpulse drifting ( first reported by @xcite ) , is manifested as an organised subpulse behaviour @xmath0 subpulses appear at progressively changing longitude in the pulse window following some particular path .",
    "the path followed by the subpulses is specific to the individual pulsar concerned and is known as drift band .",
    "it has been recently shown that subpulse drifting may be fairly common among pulsars @xcite .",
    "wide profile pulsars showing this phenomenon can be especially useful tools to understand the distribution of the radio emission regions above the neutron star s polar cap and the physics of the pulsar emission mechanism . since the wide profiles are usually interpreted as emission from one magnetic pole of a highly aligned pulsar ( i.e. magnetic axis almost parallel to rotation axis ) , our line of sight samples a large part of the polar cap .",
    "this leads to enhanced possibility of seeing multiple drift bands in such pulsars , which can provide valuable insights into the pulsar magnetospheres , as exemplified by some of the new and substantive results for psr b0826@xmath034 @xcite , psr b0815@xmath509 @xcite and psr b0818@xmath041 @xcite .",
    "psr b0826@xmath034 is a pulsar with one of the widest known pulse profiles .",
    "the earlier studies of this pulsar @xcite have brought out some unique properties @xmath6 strong evolution of the average profile with frequency , apparent nulling for 70% of time and a remarkable subpulse drift property @xmath0 multiple , curved drift bands with frequent changes and sign reversals of drift rate .",
    "multi - frequency observations , especially when done simultaneously at the different frequencies , are very useful for the study of various aspects of the frequency dependence of pulsar radiation @xcite .",
    "dispersion measure ( dm ) of pulsars can also be measured from single epoch simultaneous dual frequency observations @xcite .",
    "simultaneous , multi - frequency observations of psr b0826@xmath034 can be useful on a variety of counts : ( i ) determination of accurate dm , as the values reported and used in the literature span a fairly wide range , from 47 to 65 @xmath4 .",
    "( ii ) study of the pulsar in the null state : @xcite claim the presence of weak emission , at 1374 mhz , during the long duration nulls of this pulsar .",
    "they identify these null states as some weak mode of emission where the pulse intensity is 2% of that of the regular , strong mode , with a pulse profile that is similar to the strong mode at lower frequencies .",
    "sensitive , multi - frequency observations at the lower frequencies should provide useful information about the behaviour in the null state .",
    "( iii ) study of simultaneous subpulses : correlated behaviour of subpulses at different frequencies @xcite is useful to probe the broadband nature of the emission mechanism . for pulsars with drifting subpulses , evolution of @xmath2 ( longitude separation between adjacent drift bands ) with frequency can also be significant @xcite and a comparison of this with the frequency evolution of other profile parameters can be useful .",
    "earlier study of drift properties of psr b0826@xmath034 @xcite report different @xmath2 values at various individual frequencies which do not follow the trend predicted by profile evolution with frequency .",
    "in addition , for psr b0826@xmath034 , the intricate nature of the multiple drift bands itself deserves a broadband study .",
    "we observed psr b0826@xmath034 using the gmrt , simultaneously at 303 and 610 mhz , and individually at 157 , 325 , 610 and 1060 mhz in total intensity mode . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the results from the simultaneous dual frequency observations , and supplement these , where necessary , with the results from the single frequencies observations . in sect.[sec : observations ] we cover the observations , where a new technique for simultaneous dual frequency pulsar observations with the gmrt is presented . different sub - sections of sect.[sec : results ] describe the data analysis and results for ( 1 ) determination of dm value from simultaneous dual frequency observations , ( 2 ) study of the pulsar in its null state and ( 3 ) subpulse studies . in sect.[sec : discussions ] we discuss the implications of our findings .",
    "the gmrt consists of an array of 30 antennas , each of 45 m diameter , spread over a region of 25 km diameter , operating at 6 different wave bands between 150 and 1450 mhz @xcite .",
    "though designed to function primarily as a aperture synthesis telescope , the gmrt can be used in an array mode by adding the signals from individual dishes , either coherently or incoherently .",
    "furthermore , sub - sets of the 30 antennas can be configured completely independently in what is referred to as the sub - array mode , to effectively provide more than one `` single dish '' , thereby enabling pulsars to be observed simultaneously at multiple frequencies .",
    "the signals from different antennas and observing frequency bands are eventually converted to a baseband signal of 16 mhz band width , which is then sampled at nyquist rate .",
    "the observing bandwidth of 16 mhz is divided into 256 spectral channels in the fx correlator .",
    "these dual polarisation signals from all the antennas are then brought to the gmrt array combiner ( gac ) , where they are added coherently to get the phased array outputs for each polarisation @xcite .",
    "the gac has the facility of assigning different values of gains to each spectral channel of each polarisation of each antenna , in a completely independent manner , before the addition .    in the simultaneous multi - frequency sub - array mode of pulsar observations",
    ", the baseband signals from antennas in different sub - arrays ( operating at different radio frequencies ) can be added together in the same gac , and the data can be recorded as a single stream of multi - channel data , after integration by the desired amount .",
    "the dedispersed data streams for the different frequencies are then extracted from this single data stream during off - line processing .",
    "such a technique was employed by @xcite , who carried out simultaneous dual frequency observations using the incoherent array mode of operation of the gmrt .",
    "they utilised the fact that , while traversing the interstellar medium , different frequency signals suffer different amount of dispersion delay and as a result the pulses arrive at different times ( and hence at different positions in pulsar rotational phase ) at different frequencies .",
    "hence the on - pulse data from different frequencies can be recovered from appropriate phase windows in the pulse period , during the off - line analysis .",
    "this scheme provides naturally synchronised data from all the sub - arrays , without the need for separate , synchronised receivers for each sub - array .",
    "however , as @xcite have pointed out , this technique works well only for cases where the dispersion curves for different radio frequencies , when mapped to the 16 mhz baseband , do not overlap with each other for all phases of the on - pulse signal .",
    "this criterion becomes difficult to meet for pulsars with large duty cycle pulses and for large dms .",
    "specifically , in the case of wide profile pulsars like psr b0826@xmath034 , this scheme will definitely fail due to the fact that the pulses at both frequencies will overlap in the band and it will be impossible to extract the stream of single pulse separately at different frequencies . for such pulsars , we have devised a new scheme to carry out simultaneous multi - frequency observations .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the gac has the facility of assigning to each spectral channel , a different value of gain @xmath0 including zero gain .",
    "this allows selectable parts of the band to be processed , while blocking the rest of the band , for each antenna .",
    "the setting can be done independently for each antenna .",
    "this `` band masking '' technique allows simultaneous multi - frequency observations of all types of pulsars , independent of the combination of values of period , pulse width and dm , without having the need for separate , synchronised pulsar receiver chain for each sub array .",
    "the trick is to split the available baseband bandwidth into non - overlapping sub - bands , each of these parts being assigned to the antennas of one particular sub array , using appropriate band mask settings for each antenna .",
    "for the antennas of a given sub array , we apply nominal gain value for the typical gmrt pulsar observations in the chosen part of the band and the rest of the band is masked by applying a zero gain value . during simultaneous dual frequency observations ,",
    "the available band is divided into two parts , each part being alloted to one of the observing frequencies .    using this technique , we observed psr b0826@xmath034 simultaneously at 303 and 610 mhz with the gmrt , on october 26 , 2003 .",
    "we used two sub arrays , one with 5 antennas ( sub array#1 ) , operating at 303 mhz , and the other with 10 antennas ( sub array#2 ) , operating at 610 mhz .",
    "we put more antennas at 610 mhz to get desired sensitivity , because of the fact that the pulsar is weaker at 610 than at 303 mhz .",
    "the signals coming from the antennas of each sub array were added coherently in the gac .",
    "the total bandwidth used for the observations was 16 mhz , which was divided equally between the two frequency bands by masking 8@xmath016 mhz of the band for the antennas in sub array#1 and 0@xmath08 mhz of the band for the antennas in sub array#2 . before observing the pulsar ,",
    "both the sub - arrays were individually `` phased - up '' by estimating the phases with respect to a reference antenna in each sub - array ( from the correlator visibilities recorded on a point source calibrator ) and applying the corrections for these back into the correlator hardware .",
    "the voltage outputs from the gac were passed to the phased array pulsar receiver where the data were converted to intensity values and intensities from the two polarisations added to obtain the total intensity for each of 256 spectral channels , containing information from the two sub - arrays .",
    "these data were further integrated in time and finally recorded to disk at a sampling rate of 1.024 ms . during the off - line analysis we further integrated these data to a final time resolution of 4.096",
    "ms , as this was adequate to study this wide profile pulsar .",
    "the duration of the pulsar observation was about 1 hr , in which we recorded a data stretch of 2123 pulses from psr b0826@xmath034 , simultaneously at 303 and 610 mhz .",
    "in the first 750 of these pulses , the pulsar was in the active state and for the remaining time it was in one of its long duration null states .",
    "we observed psr b0826@xmath034 using a large number of gmrt antennas in phased array mode at 157 , 325 , 610 and 1060 mhz individually at separate epochs .",
    "these observations have significantly higher sensitivity ( by a factor of 2 or more ) compared to the corresponding observations from the dual frequency effort , and were carried out primarily to supplement and improve the conclusions obtained from the simultaneous dual frequency data set .",
    "in addition , some of these observations were accompanied with flux calibration observations using known point sources , which allows for absolute calibration of the pulsar s flux .",
    "a summary of the main parameters of each observing session is given in table .",
