    "the reaction of high - energy single dissociation of proton , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the produced hadronic state of mass @xmath3 , is usually called diffractive if the energy fraction lost by the surviving particle , @xmath4 , does not exceed 0.05",
    ". more than 10% of all the proton-(anti)proton collision events at the sps , tevatron , and the lhc are single - diffractive .",
    "hence , the importance of the single diffraction ( sd ) studies at high - energy colliders is evident .",
    "the most natural theoretical framework for description of the sd observables is regge theory @xcite , and , in particular , the triple - pomeron interaction approximation ( the 3p - model ) for high values of the missing mass ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the regge formalism is widely used in the papers on sd phenomenology @xcite@xcite . however , regarding the applications of the pomeron exchange approximation to the high - energy sd processes , such a problem emerges as the presence of secondary reggeon exchanges ( _ i.e. _ , the necessity of unambiguous determination of the 3p - model applicability range ) , and this problem is still far from its final solution .",
    "the aim of this eprint is to reanalyze the 3p - model practical relevance in view of the recent experimental data produced by the cms collaboration @xcite , as well as to obtain ( with the help of these data ) a more reliable estimation of the triple - pomeron coupling value .",
    "usually , high - energy elastic and single diffraction reactions are treated in terms of the invariant mandelstam variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the 4-momenta of the incoming particles and @xmath10 is the 4-momentum of the scattered ( anti)proton . however , if we take account of the in - channel absorption ( the significance of absorptive corrections in sd is discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite ) , then it is more convenient to use such a quantity as the transverse transferred momentum @xmath11 associated with @xmath12 by means of the relation @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "below we omit the subscript `` @xmath15 '' and consider all the nonscalar variables as vectors orthogonal to the beam axe .    a reliable way to estimate the impact of secondary reggeon exchanges on the sd cross - sections is to fit the 3p - model degrees of freedom to the experimental data in that kinematic range wherein the total contribution of secondaries is negligible and , then , to compare the model predictions with other available data .    -0.7 cm    first of all , let us formulate concisely the 3p - model itself ( the detailed consideration can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the ground of the 3p - approximation is the mueller generalized optical theorem @xcite which allows to relate the sd observables in the asymptotic kinematic regime@xmath16 to the triple - pomeron interaction amplitude ( see fig .",

    "where @xmath22 gev@xmath23 , @xmath24 is the regge trajectory of the pomeron , @xmath25 is the pomeron coupling to nucleon , and the symmetric function @xmath26 is the 3p - interaction vertex .",
    "such factors as @xmath27 and @xmath28 are singled out within the regge residue for the same reasons as for the elastic scattering @xcite .",

    "the pomeron coupling to nucleon should be the same as in the elastic scattering @xcite , @xmath34 where the free parameters take on the values presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "such a choice of parametrization for @xmath24 is specified by the following from qcd asymptotic behavior of the pomeron regge trajectory @xcite , @xmath35 and by the conditions @xmath36 which originate from the dispersion relations for regge trajectories @xcite and are expected to be valid for any reggeon . ) in no way deserve serious consideration .",
    "these expressions should be treated just as some nonanalytic quantitative approximations ( valid at low negative @xmath12 only ) to the corresponding true dynamic functions whose analytic structure is still unknown . ]",
    ".the parameter values for ( [ pomeron ] ) obtained via fitting to the elastic scattering data .",

    "consequently , at higher energies , their relative contribution into @xmath40 decreases , as the upper bound of the @xmath37-range of the 3p - interaction dominance grows fast with the collision energy increasing .",
    "this is the reason why the 3p - model relative underestimation of the cross - sections integrated over the whole kinematic range of sd at @xmath41 1800 gev is much smaller than at @xmath41 546 gev ( see table [ integr ] ) .    in view of the above - presented qualitative analysis , we come to the main conclusions :    * the 3p - model ( [ triple])([eik ] ) with constant 3p - vertex yields satisfactory predictions for such sd observables as the @xmath12-slope of @xmath42 at @xmath41 1.8 tev and 0.05 gev@xmath43 gev@xmath23 @xcite and the @xmath44-behavior of @xmath45 at @xmath41 7 tev and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "so and thus , this simple approximation allows to obtain a well - grounded estimation of the triple - pomeron coupling value and is expected to be quite applicable ( _ i.e. _ , to be a reliable phenomenological tool ) within the above - mentioned @xmath44-intervals of the 3p - interaction absolute and relative dominance . *",
    "the 3p - model underestimation of the measured sd cross - sections at the sps and tevatron energies gains a natural explanation in terms of secondary reggeon exchanges and resonance contributions .",
