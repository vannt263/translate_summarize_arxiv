    "there are two ways in which bosons can condense : via bose - einstein condensation or via spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "bose - einstein condensation occurs due to a conserved current associated with the bosons . since the total number of particles ( or other conserved quantity )",
    "can then be fixed , at low temperatures and high densities energy levels become  overcrowded . \" as a result the charge of the system must be stored the zero - momentum ground state . in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking , a conserved current is not responsible for the condensation . instead , the interactions of the bosons make it energetically favorable for them to condense .    in this paper",
    "we consider the first mechanism , bose - einstein condensation , in the case that there is both a global @xmath0 symmetry corresponding to a conserved scalar number density as well as a local gauge symmetry .",
    "in particular , we consider scalar quantum electrodynamics in which the conserved scalar current allows us to introduce a nonzero chemical potential for the scalars . to ensure the neutrality of the system we consider scalars that reside in a constant background charge density of the opposite charge .",
    "in this work we treat this density as a classical , external background .    to study the phase transitions of the system , we calculate the grand canonical partition function at the one - loop level . we find the critical temperature @xmath1 below which the ground state of the system is macroscopically occupied .",
    "below this temperature some fraction of the scalar charge must reside in a condensate .",
    "we find also an implicit expression for the critical temperature @xmath2 above which all of the scalar charge is stored in thermally excited states . in between these two temperatures both condensed and uncondensed solutions exist .",
    "for the usual neutral bose - einstein condensate these two temperatures coincide . at the critical temperature @xmath3 the expectation value of the scalars @xmath4 which is the order parameter of the phase transition goes continuously from zero to nonzero as the temperature of the system",
    "is lowered .",
    "this is characteristic of a second order phase transition . for the charged condensate we find markedly different behavior depending on the relative values of the number density @xmath5 and the mass @xmath6 . for low densities , when @xmath7 , we find evidence of a first order phase transition : in between the critical temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 the value of @xmath4 jumps discontinuously from zero .",
    "the lower critical temperature @xmath1 coincides with the critical temperature @xmath3 for the neutral condensate , while the upper critical temperature @xmath2 can be several times larger than @xmath3 in the low density regime .",
    "this implies that for the charged condensate , condensation can occur at higher temperatures than for the neutral condensate . for high densities , when @xmath8 , then @xmath2 approaches @xmath1 and the transition appears to be quite nearly second order .    the latter behavior can be understood through simple arguments .",
    "when the average kinetic energy of a boson is much greater than its coloumb energy , the gas of bosons can be treated as nearly ideal . for this to be the case near the transition temperature",
    ", it is necessary that @xmath8 .",
    "thus the physics of the charged condensate in the high density regime should be well approximated by the ideal , neutral condensate .",
    "the main interest of this paper is the low density regime , when @xmath7 . in this regime",
    "the mass of the gauge boson in the condensate @xmath9 becomes comparable with or greater than the transition temperature @xmath3 and a first order phase transition is possible .",
    "such a system of charged scalars has been considered recently in the context of helium - core white dwarf stars @xcite . in these works",
    "helium-4 nuclei play the role of the scalars while a degenerate electron gas is the background charge density .",
    "the number density of the nuclei @xmath10 is such that the average interparticle separation falls between the nuclear and atomic scales .",
    "thus the nuclei are unable to form neutral atoms , while nuclear effects are negligible .",
    "it is also the case that the number density satisfies @xmath11 , as @xmath12 .",
    "while standard theory holds that white dwarfs with carbon or oxygen cores will crystalize as they cool , it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that for helium - core white dwarfs quantum effects will become significant before the crystallization point is reached . thus instead of crystallizing , the helium nuclei can condense .    in these works the condensation of helium-4 nuclei was described using a low energy effective field theory .",
    "the work of this paper is relevant to the helium - core white dwarfs",
    "if we take scalar qed to be a relativistic effective field theory .",
    "the relativistic theory is not the most appropriate description of the helium-4 condensate .",
    "it is overly restrictive in that it enforces lorentz invariance - a symmetry we do not expect the low energy system of helium-4 nuclei and electrons to preserve .",
    "in addition it contains a heavy mode which we would expect to be beyond the scope of a low energy theory .",
    "however , it captures the significant features of the condensate including equivalent dispersion relations for the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "it was recently argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in a neutral system of deuterons and electrons , at sufficiently high densities and low temperatures the spin-1 deuterons will condense .",
    "such a system may be relevant to certain low - mass brown dwarf stars in which it is expected that such matter can exist in localized regions .",
    "in addition , because deuterons can condense at lower densities than helium , it may be possible to produce such high - density deuteron matter in laboratories in future shock wave compression experiments .",
    "the methods of this paper should be applicable to studying the phase transitions of these systems as well .",
    "let us make a few comments on the literature .",
    "gauge theories at finite temperature and symmetry breaking in gauge theories at finite temperature have been studied extensively , early works being @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) . in ref .",

    "the effect of a nonzero background fermionic current density at zero temperature was also considered in this work .",
    "it was found that an increase of the background charge density could lead to an increase in symmetry breaking .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the abelian higgs model with a background fermionic current density at finite temperature was studied in the limit that @xmath18 .",
    "the same model was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite using a somewhat different method : instead of introducing a background fermionic current , a chemical potential associated with the conserved scalar current was introduced .",
    "the @xmath18 limit was taken here as well .",
    "taking this limit allows one to ignore terms that mix the scalar and gauge bosonic fields . in our work",
    "we assume that the @xmath15 interaction is negligible compared to the electrostatic interactions .",
    "thus this mixing term plays a significant role , changing the spectrum of the theory in the condensed phase .",
    "moreover , the emphasis of these two works is the effect of a conserved current on spontaneous symmetry breaking , rather than the bose - einstein condensation of the scalars due to the conserved current .",
    "the latter is the focus of this work .",

    "we make some comments on the validity of the perturbative expansion and the relevance of our findings to helium - core white dwarf stars .",
    "we start by considering the lagrangian of a charged scalar field @xmath20 of mass @xmath6 and a gauge field @xmath21 at zero temperature . the scalars carry charge @xmath16 which we take to be some multiple of the electric charge @xmath22 .",
    "we include a background external charge density @xmath23 which has a charge opposite that of the scalars : [ lagr0 ] = - f_^2 + d _ ^2 - m^2 ^ -g a^ j _ .",
    "the covariant derivative for the scalars is defined as @xmath24 .",

    "thus at zero temperature we have a neutral system in which the charged scalars are condensed into a zero - momentum , macroscopic state . for further discussion of the zero temperature condensate",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in order to study the properties of the charged condensate at finite temperature we start by computing the grand canonical partition function @xmath37 .",
    "we use the functional integral representation of the partition function as it is most suited to the field - theoretic approach adopted above : [ z ] z = n ( ) ( f ) . here",
    "@xmath38 is an irrelevant normalization constant , @xmath39 is the inverse temperature and @xmath40 is the imaginary time .",

    "it can be seen from the lagrangian ( [ lagr1 ] ) that a nonzero expectation value for the scalar potential acts as a shift in the chemical potential , except in its coupling to the external current @xmath58 .",

    "the physical content of the theory is apparent and no unphysical degrees of freedom need to be introduced .",

    "we see from figure 1 that lowering the value of @xmath138 appears to increase @xmath2 relative to @xmath1 .",
    "lower densities also appear to correspond to larger discontinuities in @xmath4 .    for the charged condensate ,",
    "as @xmath152 increases relative to @xmath153 the function @xmath137 appears to asymptotically approach a single curve that is similar to the curve for the neutral condensate .",
    "the phase transition appears to be nearly very second order with @xmath4 increasing more - or - less continuously as @xmath135 decreases .",
    "even though the phase transition may technically be first order the jump in @xmath4 becomes negligibly small .",
    "the above contours were drawn using the approximation @xmath36 in the condensed phase .",
    "the actual condensate solutions are slightly to the left of these contours , when @xmath154 .",
    "the existence of a first order phase transition at low densities can be understood in the following way . in the low density regime",
    "the mass of the bosonic excitation @xmath134 becomes comparable to or greater than the transition temperature .",

    "@xmath4 must jump discontinuously so that charge that had been stored in thermal excitations is stored instead in the condensate . as the density is lowered , @xmath3 continues to decrease relative to @xmath134 and the effect grows more pronounced .",
    "let us now find @xmath2 .",
    "in the nonrelativistic limit we can approximate the number density as n mv^2 + , where @xmath156 . here",
    "we have taken @xmath157 in the condensed phase .",
    "changing to dimensionless variables x ,  and   y , the number density becomes n mv^2 + ( ) ^3/2 _ 0^ .",
    "let us assume that at the critical temperature @xmath2 the expectation value of the condensate as given by the above expression is roughly the same order of magnitude as it is at zero temperature : @xmath158 .",
    "let us also assume that @xmath2 is roughly the same order of magnitude as @xmath1 as given by ( [ tc1 ] ) .",
    "then when @xmath159 we have @xmath160 . in terms of our dimensionless variables",
    "this is @xmath161 . in this regime",
    "we can do a low temperature expansion of the above integral @xcite .",
    "the first two terms of the low temperature expansion give : [ nmum ] n m v^2 + ( ) ^3/2 , + where li is the polylogarithm .",
    "@xmath2 corresponds to the maximum temperature at which this expression can be satisfied for a fixed @xmath5 .",
    "equivalently , it corresponds to the critical point of the function @xmath137 .",
    "so to find @xmath2 we differentiate both sides of the above expression with respect to @xmath4 and we set @xmath162 .",
    "we find that at the critical temperature , @xmath2 and @xmath4 are related by v_c2 - .",
    "substituting this expression for @xmath4 into ( [ nmum ] ) gives an implicit expression for @xmath2 in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in figure 2 we plot the ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath1 as a function of @xmath163 , from @xmath164 to @xmath165 .",
    "again we set @xmath166 .",
    "as @xmath5 decreases the ratio @xmath167 grows .",
    "since @xmath1 coincides with the critical temperature for the neutral condensate , this implies that for the charged condensate at low densities , condensation can occur at temperatures several times higher than for the neutral condensate . in high density regimes",
    "where @xmath168 , the above approximations break down .",
    "we expect that in this limit the coulomb energy of the scalars should be small compared to their kinetic energy and thus @xmath167 should approach @xmath169 .",
    "we have calculated the one - loop grand canonical partition function for scalar electrodynamics at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "we considered an electrically neutral system in which the charged scalars reside in a background density of the opposite charge . using the background field method we found a result that was gauge condition dependent when the background fields did not satisfy the tree - level equations of motion . to address this",
    ", we required consistency with a ward identity in order to determine the off - shell thermodynamic potential .    using this potential we could determine , to lowest order in perturbation theory , the thermal expectation value of the charged scalars @xmath4 as a function of temperature .",
    "plotting @xmath137 for various values of the scalar mass @xmath6 and number density @xmath5 , we found evidence of a first order phase transition in the low density regime , when @xmath7 . in between two critical temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath4 jumps discontinuously from zero .",
    "the lower temperature @xmath1 coincides with the critical temperature for a neutral condensate , while @xmath2 can be several times higher in the low density regime .",
    "thus the phase transition for the charged condensate can occur at higher temperatures than for the neutral condensate .",
    "the strength of the first order phase transition appears to increase with decreasing density .    the critical temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 give only lower and upper bounds on the transition temperature .",
    "finding the exact transition temperature as well as other physically interesting quantities , such as the latent heat involved in the phase transition or the timescale for the transition to occur , requires a more thorough understanding of the energetics of these solutions and their stability or metastability .",
    "investigation of these questions would entail using the constraint equation @xmath170 to  integrate out \" @xmath27 so that the free energy density @xmath171 .",
    "this is analogous to our procedure for the zero - temperature potential in equation ( [ v ] ) .",
    "the above conclusions were based on a one - loop calculation .",
    "it is reasonable to consider the effects of higher order corrections in perturbation theory . in thermal field theory at high temperatures , the perturbative expansion can break down , even for weakly coupled theories .",
    "this can occur when the temperature of the system is greater than the masses of the particles running in the loops . for theories with massless particles ,",
    "this breakdown is often signaled by the appearance of infrared divergences at higher loops .    for the system described here , because the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken in the condensed phase , the gauge bosons are massive .",
    "thus one can compute to any order in perturbation theory without encountering infrared divergences .",
    "moreover , in the condensate , as long as the temperature is sufficiently below the gauge boson mass @xmath134 and the mass of the remaining scalar degree of freedom @xmath172 , the loop expansion parameter should remain small . in the uncondensed phase ,",
    "the massless photons interact with each other only through the massive scalars , the lightest of these scalars having mass @xmath173 .",
    "thus as long as @xmath174 our considerations in the uncondensed phase should be valid .    for a second order phase transition or for a weakly first order phase transition",
    "these criteria will be violated near the phase transition point , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "thus perturbation theory can not be considered reliable in the vicinity the phase transition . however , for a strongly first order phase transition , which is precisely the interest of this work , this region is avoided . in the low density regime",
    "the condensate solution does nt pass near @xmath177 ; the temperature of the system is always small compared to the masses of the excitations in the condensate .",
    "thus higher order corrections to the results found above should be small .",
    "to illustrate this we plot @xmath137 in figure 3 for the values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 that are relevant for helium - core white dwarf stars ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "the orange region corresponds to where @xmath179 and thus perturbation theory can be unreliable . the condensate solution which is the upper solid blue curve is well outside this region .",
    "we also mark the point where , when @xmath78 , @xmath180 . to the left of this point ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath181 , calculations of , say , the free energy density in the _ uncondensed _ phase using the expressions obtained above should not to be trusted .",
    "this may place some limitations on calculating the exact transition temperature , if the phase transition occurs in this region .",
    "however , it is possible that methods such as resummation can be applied in this region to obtain more reliable results .",
    "let us end with some comments on physical applications",
    ". in helium - core white dwarf stars the number density of the helium nuclei is such that @xmath11 .",
    "thus based on the arguments given above , we might expect the condensation of these nuclei to be a first order phase transition .",
    "we may also expect the condensation temperature for the helium nuclei to be somewhat greater than that for neutral bosons .",
    "the latent heat associated with the phase transition could potentially delay the cooling of the star . for a carbon - core white dwarf star of mass @xmath182 which crystallizes",
    ", the latent heat associated with crystallization can increase the classical cooling time by a factor of @xmath183 @xcite . however , one of the main features of a condensed - core white dwarf is that it cools much more rapidly than white dwarfs with uncondensed or crystallized cores @xcite .",
    "it is possible that any contribution to the cooling history coming from the latent heat will be overwhelmed by the rapid cooling in the condensed phase .    in this work we treated the background charge density as static and classical . for the system of nuclei and electrons in the cores of white dwarfs ,",
    "this is not a good approximation .",
    "the electrons , i.e. the background charge density , form a degenerate fermi gas with gapless excitations . due to these excitations ,",
    "the electrons could play a significant role in the phase transition .",
