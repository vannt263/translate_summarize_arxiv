    "the large number of relevant electronic states and the interplay of hybridization and interaction effects makes it even difficult to identify relevant degrees of freedom or arrive at low - energy effective models .",
    "an understanding of electronic correlations lies at the heart of most open problems in this field .",
    "although the metallic character of many materials lends hope to the hypothesis that relevant interactions are screened and thus of short range , they can in principle drive correlations over all ranges of spatial distances .",
    "modern approaches@xcite focused on the dominant role of the local coulomb repulsion .",
    "in particular , dynamical mean - field theory@xcite ( dmft ) has proven to be very successful .",

    "prominent examples are systems near a quantum critical point@xcite or cuprate high - temperature superconductors.@xcite in recent years extensions of dmft have been put forward to remedy these shortcomings by the inclusion of some spatial correlations between electrons.@xcite in the cluster approaches , the problem is mapped to an effective cluster of few lattice sites and , in analogy to dmft , this cluster is treated like a complex impurity in a dynamic external field .",
    "these approaches capture short - range correlations quite accurately and have contributed considerably to the understanding of pseudogaps and shadow bands,@xcite as well as to the possible occurrence of quantum critical points.@xcite    however , some problems remain in these theories . in cluster dmft@xcite ( cdmft ) , for example , the translational invariance of the crystal lattice is not fully respected .",
    "the dynamical cluster approximation@xcite ( dca ) remedies this shortcoming , but the question remains which choice for the size and geometry of the cluster is advantageous.@xcite but the most fundamental limitation is the restriction to rather short - ranged correlations .    in this paper we present a novel kind of self - consistent approach to correlated lattice systems which is in principle capable of including nonlocal correlations of arbitrary distance .",

    "in contrast , the inclusion of next - next - nearest neighbors ( @xmath134 ) still has considerable impact on the high - energy features at negative energies while at positive energies only small differences are induced .",
    "this apparently indicates a reduced hybridization and corresponding band narrowing for states in the vicinity of the negative band edge .",
    "the importance of lattice structure , coherence and correlations for the possible development of hybridization gaps and band splittings as they were already discussed in the symmetric case is evident from these results .",
    "the longer - ranged correlations also seem to work in favor of restoring particle - hole symmetry in the low - energy region [ see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : res4](c ) ] , a phenomenon which is also discussed in connection with the cuprate superconductors.@xcite    ( c ) . the dca result is taken from fig .  5 of ref .   and was obtained from self - consistent quantum monte carlo solution of a 16-site cluster for @xmath129 and @xmath135 .",
    "the filling for the dca calculation of @xmath136 is slightly larger than the nld(3 ) filling , @xmath137 .",
    "the inset shows an enlargement of the region around the fermi level . ]",
    "figure [ fig : res5 ] compares a nld(3 ) spectral function for finite doping and @xmath138 with a spectrum obtained from a dca calculation as it was published in fig .  5 of ref .  .",
    "the qualitative features of both approaches nicely agree : the humps and minima visible in the dca spectra translate to corresponding but more pronounced features in the nld(3 ) .",
    "given the different nature of the two approximations , this provides additional evidence for the physical nature of the observed structures .",
    "the magnitude of the pseudogap is of the same order in both approaches , although the dca result is slightly larger and the low - energy spectrum much more asymmetric .",
    "one reason for this can be found in the enhanced two - impurity noncrossing approximation as the two - impurity solver , which is known to produce a too small many - body low - energy scale for the siam .",
    "this is especially relevant for the low - energy region and also translates to self - consistent approximations ( see , e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "the different temperatures of both calculations should not be relevant for the qualitative features as @xmath20 is already rather low and further decreasing it will only slightly deepen the pseudogap .",
    "however , a qualitative difference between the two calculations is found in the different fillings which in general strongly influences the low - energy spectral function . the analysis in ref .   revealed that decreasing the filling from @xmath136 to @xmath139 ( for otherwise identical parameters ) leads to a spectral function which is nearly particle - hole symmetric at low energies and",
    "does not exhibit a pseudogap . in this light , the nld(3 )",
    "spectral function for @xmath140 with a nearly symmetric low - energy spectrum and a small pseudogap represent a plausible intermediate solution .",
    "we have proposed a novel general and nonperturbative scheme for the treatment of correlated electron systems on crystal lattices .",
    "our approach represents an extension of the well - known dmft to include nonlocal two - site correlations with arbitrary spatial extent .    the self - consistent formulation establishes a mapping between nonlocal two - site correlations of the lattice model and the equivalent functions of various two - impurity anderson models with varying distance",
    "the two - impurity models are solved in real - space , but the extracted correlation functions are transformed into momentum space via a fourier transform . thereby translational invariance is built into our scheme by construction .",
    "most important , the spatial range of correlations which are explicitly included in the treatment is unrestricted in principle .",
    "it corresponds to the maximum impurity - impurity distance in an effective tiam which is solved in our approach , and is therefore only limited by the accuracy of the two - impurity solver .    as a first application",
    ", we applied our scheme to the hubbard model on a two - dimensional simple - cubic lattice .",
    "we found that the leading nonlocal correlations produce a pseudogap in the low - energy single - particle excitation spectrum as it is to be expected.@xcite moreover , pronounced side - peaks occur as a signature of increasing coherence .",
    "in a situation without particle - hole symmetry we could clearly discriminate between the mott - hubbard gap induced by mostly local atomic correlations and the pseudogap , which is found in the many - body resonance at the fermi level .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the inclusion of correlations over larger distances brings out more details of the excitation spectra in the high - energy region .",
    "additionally , our method compares very well to results from the dca .",
    "the spectral functions of both approaches exhibit similar qualitative features for finite doping , although they are more pronounced in our scheme . also , the pseudogap obtained within both approaches is of the same magnitude .",
    "thus , the scheme presented opens an excellent perspective for more detailed investigations of systems where nonlocal correlations play an important role .",
    "these include phase transitions and critical phenomena in general , and quantum critical points in particular , as they are found , for example , in heavy fermion compounds or cuprate superconductors .",
    "also , the calculation of nontrivial critical exponents and their scaling behavior@xcite seems to be in reach using this new approach . in some cases",
    "it will nevertheless be necessary to include higher - order irreducible correlations beyond those between only two sites .",
    "this will be of particular importance , when complicated ground states involving correlations on plaquettes of sites or general resonating valence bond - states are under consideration.@xcite    we thank eberhard jakobi for fruitful discussions , kuang - shing chen for providing us with the dca data shown in fig .",
