    "a crucial aspect for assessing the real evolution in size of individual galaxies is to evaluate how many of the distant galaxies have remained compact till today , comparing high- and low - z number densities .",
    "cassata et al . ( 2011 ) and ( 2013 ) have studied the evolution of the number density of passive early - type galaxies and concluded this is driven by both the size growth of compact galaxies and , mostly , by the appearance of new early type galaxies with larger sizes .",

    "the stellar mass of a system is defined as the sum of the mass in living stars + the mass of stellar remnants .",
    "assuming passive evolution , the stellar mass of a galaxy changes with time simply due to the evolution of its stars : as they progressively evolve and eventually die , they retain only part of their mass as remnant .",
    "for a stellar generation of solar metallicity , a chabrier imf and the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model , the fraction of initial stellar mass that remains is equal to 1 for ages less than @xmath26 yr , while it can be approximated as @xmath27 at older ages , where @xmath28 is the age of the stellar population in years .    if a high - z galaxy is observed very soon after the end of the bulk of star formation ,",

    ", out compactness threshold at low redshift is @xmath33    it is worth noting that passive evolution in mass will also lead to larger sizes for adiabatic expansion ( hills 1980 ) if the mass returned by stars to the interstellar medium is lost by galaxies in a sn- and/or agn - driven galactic wind , as indicated by x - ray data for early - type galaxies ( ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) . such mechanism is internally driven and may contribute to the evolution in size .",
    "the effects on galaxy sizes of rapid mass loss driven by quasar superwinds in massive galaxies and by supernova - driven winds in less massive galaxies have been discussed by fan et al .",
    "one type of galaxies where there is unequivocal evidence for merger - driven evolution both in mass and in size are the brightest cluster galaxies ( eg .",
    "lidman et al .",
    "2012 , valentinuzzi et al . 2010b , but see also stott et al .",
    "however , such galaxies may have a very different evolution from the rest of the massive galaxy population ( p13 ) .",
    "finally , if b13 used maraston ( 2005 ) model instead of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , their high - z masses would be typically @xmath320.15 dex smaller due to the different treatment of the tp - agb stellar phase , which is important for stellar population ages typical of high - z galaxies , but is uninfluential on the masses at low - z . as a consequence ,",
    "adopting maraston s model , the compactness density threshold at low - z would shift to @xmath34 . in the following",
    "we will use the compactness criterion based on bruzual & charlot , unless otherwise stated , but we will show that this is a major source of uncertainty in the comparison of high- and low - z samples . above the pm2gc mass limit",
    "there are 141 compact galaxies according to the compactness criterion based on bruzual & charlot , and 294 using maraston .",
    "all pm2gc galaxies have a spectrum from the sdss , the 2dfgrs ( colless et al . 2001 ) or the mgcz ( driver et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the galaxy stellar history was derived by fitting the spectra with the spectro - photometric model described in fritz et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2011 ) .",
    "all the main spectro - photometric features ( continuum flux and shape , and emission and absorption lines ) are reproduced by summing the theoretical spectra of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) of 12 different ages , from @xmath35 to @xmath36 years ( p13 ) . from the spectral analysis , it is possible to derive an estimate of the average age of the stars in a galaxy weighted by the light we observe .",
    "the lw age was computed by weighing the age of each ssp composing the integrated spectrum with its bolometric flux . for passive galaxies , this reflects to a first approximation the epoch of the last star formation episode .",
    "the model age determination can be quite uncertain , especially at the old ages considered here , and it is necessary to evaluate how these uncertainties affect the number density estimates .",
    "the spectrophotometric model obtains the best fit star formation history , and consequent lw age , by performing a random exploration of the parameter space , searching for the combination of star formation rate and extinction values of the various single stellar populations that minimizes the differences between the synthetic and the observed spectra .",
    "as explained in fritz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the internal error on the lw age is estimated by exploiting the characteristics of the optimization routine .",
    "the path towards the best fit parameters depends on their initial value , and so does the final solution ( star formation history and , consequently , lw age ) .",
    "we perform 11 simulations for each metallicity , and explore three metallicities , changing both the initial parameters and the seed of the random number generator , sampling the entire space of solutions .",
    "the lw age error is taken to be half the difference between the highest and lowest values of lw age among all simulations .",
    "such error is less than 1 gyr for all compact pm2gc galaxies except for a few cases , with a median of 0.3 gyr ( see left panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "to further test the age uncertainty , we used synthetic spectra of galaxy templates with different star formation histories , mimicking the histories of galaxies of different morphological types ( ellipticals to late spirals ) , post - starbursts and constant star formation rates truncated at different times , as was done in fritz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . the `` true '' ( input ) lw age of such templates are compared to the lw age recovered by the spectral fitting in the right panel of fig .  1 . generally , the model is able to recover the input lw age with a good approximation , except for our oldest template for which it underestimates it . for our purposes , it is important that the model does not show a tendency to _ overestimate _ the lw ages , thereby assigning old ages to young galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we want to compare the number density of compact passive galaxies at high - z with that of equally compact low - z galaxies whose lw age testifies that they were already passive at high - z , and therefore should comply with the b13 criterion for passivity . to do this ,",
    "we select galaxies at @xmath37 with a lw age equal to or greater than the time elapsed between three high redshift values ( @xmath38 and 2 , corresponding to lookback times 6.3 , 7.8 and 8.8 gyr , respectively ) and @xmath39 .    visually inspecting the spectra of all 39 ( 59 for maraston ) compact pm2gc galaxies with lw ages @xmath40 gyr ( z=1 ) ,",
    "their passivity at the time they are observed is confirmed by the lack of emission lines : only 5 ( 7 for maraston ) galaxies have weak ( equivalent width [ oii ] @xmath41  ) emission with line ratios consistent with a weak agn .",
    "figure  2 shows that the stellar mass distribution of compact passive high - z galaxies is similar to the mass distribution of pm2gc compact and old ( lw age corresponding to @xmath42 ) galaxies , and a ks - test is unable to prove there are significant differences ( p=0.1 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that pm2gc compact and old galaxies are local counterparts of the high - z compact and passive population .     than the lookback time to @xmath43 ) and of b13 high - z compact passive galaxies ( dashed histogram ) . ]    matching progenitors and descendants is one major problem in trying to assess the number density evolution of any type of high - z galaxies , including compact galaxies .",
    "different methods have been proposed to obtain a meaningful comparison , and none of them is free from problems .",
    "for example , a morphological selection of early - type galaxies both at high- and low - z does not take into account the fact that a large number of high - z late - type galaxies turn into early - type galaxies by z=0 , while using a fixed number density is prone to partial contamination and relies on semi - analytic models that do not reproduce the galaxy stellar mass function at redshifts above zero ( leja et al . 2013 ) .",
    "our approach based on lw ages is not free from problems either , because it relies on the assumption that compact passive galaxies at high-@xmath44 have not been `` rejuvenated '' by star formation at subsequent times . indeed , while it is reasonable to assume that all local compact galaxies with old lw ages must have been compact and passive at high-@xmath44 , not all compact passive galaxies at high-@xmath44 necessarily have old lw ages today .",
    "there might be some of their local counterparts that are still compact , but have not remained always passive throughout their evolution , as at later times they may have experienced some episode of star formation such to disqualify them from being `` old '' in the local sample .",
    "though not optimal , our method links the high-@xmath44 population with at least some of their low-@xmath44 counterparts , thus providing an upper limit to the evolution of the number density of compact passive galaxies , i.e. , to the difference between the high-@xmath44 and low-@xmath44 number of such galaxies .",
    "the high - z number densities for passive , star - forming and all galaxies are taken directly from b13 .",
    "they are for a mass limit @xmath45 , which is slightly lower than the @xmath46 pm2gc limit .",
    "this difference should have little effect on the number densities , as most of the high - z compact galaxies are well above the pm2gc limit ( guillermo barro 2013 , private communication ) .",
    "the different limit in mass will , again , result in underestimating the number density of local compacts relative to that of high - z compacts .    for the pm2gc we compute the number density of compact galaxies of different lw ages as described above , as well as the total number density of all low - z compact galaxies , regardless of their age .",
    "the number of galaxies is divided by the comoving volume of the pm2gc survey , that extends over an effective area of 30.88deg@xmath47 on the sky between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "no volume correction is needed , as the survey is complete down to our mass limit at @xmath49 .",
    "our number densities for both bruzual & charlot and maraston high - z models are given in table  1 .",
    "figure  3 shows the mass - size diagram of all pm2gc galaxies above our mass limit .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the compactness threshold of b13 with and without the mass evolution effect , respectively .",
    "the compactness criterion isolates galaxies approximately 2@xmath50 away from the median pm2gc mass - size relation , as the plot shows .",
    "this compactness criterion is slightly less strict than the limit for superdense galaxies adopted in p13 ( see green points in fig .",
    "3 ) .     and",
    "2@xmath50 lines , is the pm2gc median .",
    "green points represent superdense galaxies according to the compactness criterion adopted in p13 . ]",
    "our main result is presented in fig .  4 , where the number density of low redshift compact galaxies is compared with the high redshift values . selecting only pm2gc compact galaxies with lw ages at least as old as the lookback time between @xmath37 and @xmath38 and 2 we plot their number density values as red circles at the corresponding redshifts in the left panel .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the pm2gc number densities arises from the precision of the lw age estimate obtained by the spectrophotometric model .",
    "the number density error bars in fig .  4",
    "take into account the change in number density varying the lw age corresponding to each redshift by @xmath51 gyr . as discussed in  2.2.1",
    ", this corresponds to the upper envelope of the internal age uncertainty , and we have no reason to believe there should be any systematic overestimation of ages in the modeling .",
    "such error dominates over the poissonian error .",
    "the x - axis error bar shows the @xmath52 gyr intervals in redshift .    from fig .  4 , the number ratio of high- to low - z densities is @xmath53 at @xmath43 ( no evolution ) and only @xmath54 at @xmath16 .",
    "the low - z estimates are within 1 - 1.5 @xmath50 of the high - z estimates .",
    "the red squares in the plot show the pm2gc number densities obtained adopting maraston ( 2005 ) model at high - z , hence shifting the high - z masses and consequent compactness threshold by 0.15 dex . in this case ,",
    "high- and low - z number density values are even closer , their ratio being = 1.6 at @xmath16 .",
    "we stress once again that , in deriving the number density at low - z , only compact galaxies that have remained passive since high - z are counted .",
    "some high - z compact quiescent galaxies might have remained compact till today but have experienced star formation after they were observed at high - z , and these are not considered in our low - z compact galaxy census .",
    "our number of old compact galaxies at low - z is therefore potentially a lower limit to the number of compact quiescent galaxies that have remained compact .",
    "consequently , the difference between the high - z and low - z values in fig .",
    "4 provides an upper limit to the number density evolution .",
    "although an exact estimate of the evolution is hampered by the various uncertainties involved , clearly a strong evolution in the number density of compact galaxies , such as the factor 10 sometimes quoted from simulations ( hopkins et al .",
    "2009 ) , is not supported by our analysis .",
    "our results are consistent with a small or even negligible evolution in the number density of compact galaxies , suggesting that at most @xmath32half of the high - z compact galaxies have evolved in size by @xmath55 .    at low - z ,",
    "the total number density of compact galaxies in the pm2gc , regardless of their lw age , is @xmath56 .",
    "this value is compared in the right panel of fig .  4 with the total number density of compact passive + star - forming galaxies in candels , which reaches a maximum value @xmath57 at @xmath58 .",
    "this comparison suggests that the bulk of the compact galaxies have formed their structure and their mass by @xmath59 , and that an additional minority of them , up to about 1/3 of today s compact galaxies , might have formed at lower redshifts .",
    "this comparison also shows that the total number density of pm2gc compact galaxies of any age is significantly higher than the number density of passive compact galaxies at high - z . relaxing the restrictive assumption of no subsequent star formation",
    ", the whole population of high - z compact passive galaxies could evolve into the local compact population .",
    "the mild number density evolution of compact passive galaxies we find in this paper is in good agreement with the results from cassata et al .",
    "( 2011 ) who found that the number density of compact ( at least 1@xmath50 below the local mass - size relation ) early - type passive galaxies decreases only by a factor of two from @xmath60 to @xmath55 .",
    "the compactness criterion and the mass range adopted in this paper are dictated by the b13 high - z sample ( to which we aim to compare ) .",
    "it would be desirable to assess the number density evolution of galaxies of different masses and degree of compactness , as soon as such detailed information will become available at high - z , to investigate whether the evolution varies with galaxy mass and compactness .",
    "as we have shown above , the b13 criterion corresponds to about 2@xmath50 below the low - z median mass - size relation , which is similar to what most previous works used to define compact galaxies .",
    "this is the typical degree of compactness of high - z massive and passive galaxies found in other studies as well , except for the extremely compact galaxies in the sample at @xmath61 of van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , that are outliers in the stellar densities and radii distributions ( see p13 for a discussion ) .",
    "we can attempt to compare our results to the work of cassata et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who considered separately the evolution of `` ultra - compact '' _ early - type _ ( morphologically selected ) passive galaxies , defined to have sizes at least 0.4 dex below the local _ early - type _ mass - size relation and representing about 20 - 30% of their sample at @xmath62 .",
    "if we consider pm2gc early - type galaxies ( ellipticals+s0s , calvi et al .",
    "2012 ) that are old in lw age ( @xmath43 ) and lie at least 0.4 dex below the pm2gc median mass - size relation for early - type galaxies ( table  1 in p13 ) , taking into account a 0.1 dex mass evolution as before , we obtain a number density @xmath63 and @xmath64 for bruzual & charlot and maraston high - z models , respectively , again under the assumption of no star formation activity at redshifts below 1 . for reference , the ultracompact densities in cassata et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "this seems to suggest that the density evolution of the ultracompact population has been stronger than that of the whole compact population , up to a factor between 2.5 and 5 .",
    "again , these are upper limits to the evolution , assuming no star formation at later times .",
    "this is based on a morphologically selected sample , and it would be useful to repeat the comparison with large high - z samples of ultracompact galaxies of all morphological types as was done in the rest of the paper .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the most extreme compact galaxies at high redshifts mostly lie at @xmath67 ( cassata et al .",
    "2011 , cimatti et al .",
    "2012 , p13 fig .  4 ) , and are likely observed soon after the end of their star formation activity . under these conditions , the passive evolution in mass we discussed in ",
    ".2.1 can be very strong on a short timescale .",
    "a galaxy forming the bulk of its stars at @xmath68 , between @xmath69 and today will have lost 19 - 23% of its @xmath69 observed mass . already at @xmath43 ,",
    "such galaxy will have lost 13 - 17% of its @xmath69 mass .",
    "the effect could be much larger for galaxies that stopped forming stars just before being observed as passive at high redshift , as suggested by the b13 results .",
    "in general , passive mass evolution affects the comparison of high- and low - z samples .",
    "a stellar generation evolving passively since high - z , by @xmath55 will have lost almost 50% of its initial mass .",
    "the exact amount of mass evolution depends on the imf assumed , on the epoch of major star formation and detailed star formation history , therefore is highly uncertain .",
    "the effect will become more and more prominent as observations approach the epoch when star formation stopped .",
    "we suggest that the extreme compactness of @xmath67 galaxies and the very strong evolution between @xmath16 and @xmath43 might be at least partially due to a fast passive evolution in _ mass _ between @xmath16 and @xmath43 .",
    "we place an upper limit to the evolution in the number density of passively evolving , compact galaxies from high redshift to the nearby universe .",
    "we conclude that at most half , and possibly an even smaller fraction , of the high - z population has appreciably evolved in size .",
    "a more precise estimate of the amount of size evolution is hindered mainly by the uncertainty in high - z galaxy mass estimates , and by the difficulty to match exactly progenitors and descendants on the basis of luminosity - weighted ages .",
    "however , even under conservative assumptions , our results do not demand a major evolution in size for most of the compact high - z galaxies . on the other hand , we find that the amount of evolution may be stronger ( upper limits between 2 and 5 ) for the most extreme , ultracompact galaxies , which represent a minority of the massive and passive population at high - z . a detailed comparison as a function of galaxy mass and degree of compactness will be feasible when the corresponding information becomes available for high - z samples .",

    "<S> we compare the number density of compact ( small size ) massive galaxies at low and high redshift using our padova millennium galaxy and group catalogue ( pm2gc ) at @xmath0 and the candels results from barro et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2013 ) at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the number density of local compact galaxies with luminosity weighted ( lw ) ages compatible with being already passive at high redshift is compared with the density of compact passive galaxies observed at high - z . </S>",
    "<S> our results place an upper limit of a factor @xmath2 to the evolution of the number density and are inconsistent with a significant size evolution for most of the compact galaxies observed at high - z . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution may be instead significant ( up to a factor 5 ) for the most extreme , ultracompact galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> considering _ all _ compact galaxies , regardless of lw age and star formation activity , a minority of local compact galaxies ( @xmath3 ) might have formed at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the secular decrease of the galaxy stellar mass due to simple stellar evolution may in some cases be a non - negligible factor in the context of the evolution of the mass - size relation , and we caution that passive evolution in mass should be taken into account when comparing samples at different redshifts . </S>"
