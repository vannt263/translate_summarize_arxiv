    "lower and upper eigenvalue estimates for operators like the dirac operator on a closed riemannian spin manifold are derived by very different methods .",
    "lower estimates are usually based on a bochner - weitzenbck formula , i.e.  on an intelligent partial integration .",
    "the first idea to obtain upper bounds on dirac eigenvalues is due to vafa and witten @xcite who show that there are upper eigenvalue estimates for all twisted dirac operators on a closed riemannian spin manifold solely in geometric data of the manifold but independent of the twist .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "compare the dirac operator @xmath0 ( or a multiple of it ) to a twisted dirac operator @xmath1 acting on sections of the same vector bundle . by index theory",
    "make sure that @xmath1 has a kernel .",
    "let @xmath2 be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 of @xmath1 .",
    "estimate the norm of the difference ( which is of zero order ) , @xmath3 , by geometric quantities .",
    "then at least @xmath2 eigenvalues of @xmath0 are bounded by @xmath4 .",
    "how can one get a good twisted dirac operator @xmath1 to compare @xmath0 with ?",
    "one way to achieve this is to take a map @xmath5 of nonzero degree and pull - back suitable vector bundles from the sphere to twist the dirac operator with .",
    "the fact that @xmath6 has no cohomology in middle dimensions helps a lot for the index computations .",
    "taking for @xmath7 the gauss map of a surface composed with a suitable self - mapping of @xmath8 baum used this idea to show    [ baumtheo ] _",
    "( baum ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) ) _ let @xmath9 be a compact oriented surface of genus @xmath10 .",
    "then there is an eigenvalue @xmath11 of the dirac operator on @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 where @xmath14    the torus ( @xmath15 ) can not be dealt with by this approach because its gauss map has degree zero .",

    "one constructs test spinors for the @xmath29 eigenvalue using the eigenspinors of the previous eigenvalues and the coordinate functions given by the immersion .    to convert this into an upper bound on the eigenvalues themselves one has to assume something on the smallest eigenvalue .",

    "in general , the ambient space can be any riemannian spin manifold carrying killing spinors .",
    "these killing spinors are then restricted to the hypersurface and used as test spinors .",

    "our estimates improve those of theorem [ bunketheo ] , in case of higher codimension they are logically independent because they make statements about different operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section we study spinor modules for the clifford algebra of a direct sum of two euclidean vector spaces .",
    "later this will be applied to the sum of the tangent space and the normal space of the submanifold .    in the second part",
    "we compare the spinor connection of the submanifold to the spinor connection of the ambient space .",
    "this implies a relation between the dirac operator of the ambient space and the dirac operator of the submanifold twisted with the spinor bundle of the normal bundle .",
    "the mean curvature appears as a correction term .",
    "we hope that the first two sections in which the `` submanifold theory '' of dirac operators is established will also be of independent interest .    in the third section",
    "we prove the eigenvalue estimate for submanifolds of arbitrary codimension in a riemannian spin manifold with killing spinors .",
    "the main result for real killing constant is theorem [ abschreell ] .",
    "the case of imaginary killing constant is somewhat more complicated because then killing spinors do not have constant length .",
    "the estimate is given in theorem [ abschimaginaer ] .    in the forth part",
    "we restrict our attention to hypersurfaces .",
    "the results of the previous section yield bounds on the eigenvalues of the classical ( untwisted ) dirac operator of the hypersurface .",
    "we also discuss relations with the willmore problem in surface theory .",
    "moreover , we explain how one can bound more eigenvalues if ( and only if ) the hypersurface bounds an open subset .    in the last section",
    "we show how to get upper bounds on _ all _ dirac eigenvalues .",
    "these estimates involve the laplace eigenvalues of the hypersurface .    * acknowledgement . *",
    "it is a pleasure to thank bernd ammann for helpful discussions .",
    "our aim is to compare the dirac operator on a riemannian spin manifold with the one on a spin submanifold . in particular",
    ", we have to compare the restriction of the spinor bundle to the submanifold with the genuine spinor bundle of the submanifold itself .",
    "the starting point is the splitting of the restricted tangent bundle of the large manifold into tangent and normal bundle of the submanifold .",
    "hence we need to compare the spinor modules of the clifford algebra of a direct sum of two euclidean vector spaces with the spinor modules associated with the two factors . in principle , this is contained in ( * ? ? ?",
