    "the acceleration is associated with the lagrangian velocity increment in time for sufficiently small timescales , in a far dissipative subrange where turbulent fluctuations are smoothed .",

    "they have shown how the multifractal formalism offers an alternative approach which is rooted in the phenomenology of turbulence .",
    "the lagrangian statistics was derived from the eulerian statistics without introducing ad hoc hypotheses .",
    "although the formalism is not capable to account for small acceleration values ( typical situation for the multifractal approach ) , the obtained acceleration pdf captures the dns data well in the tails , with normalized acceleration values ranging from about @xmath33 up to @xmath34 . alas , one can observe an overestimation in this range which can be clearly seen from the predicted contribution to the fourth - order moment , @xmath35 , as compared to the dns data .",
    "high degree of isotropy of the simulated stationary flow suggests equivalence of cartesian components of acceleration aligned to fixed directions , and the resulting dns distribution obtained by averaging over the components has been found with no observable asymmetry with respect to @xmath36 .",

    "in contrast to our previous studies of the conditional acceleration statistics  @xcite , here we give a self - consistent treatment of the model by explicit accounting for a gaussian distribution of lagrangian velocity fluctuations that is observed experimentally .",
    "we give a complete quantitative description of the available experimental data on _ both _ the conditional and unconditional acceleration statistics within the framework of a single model with a single set of fit parameters .",
    "importance of the present approach is that the lagrangian single - particle modeling is dynamical and has a deductive support from the navier - stokes equation , with few assumptions justified by the turbulence phenomenology being used .",
    "this approach adds a new look to homogeneous isotropic turbulence modeling which is alternative to those given by the recent multifractal and ad hoc langevin stochastic approaches .",
    "it should be emphasized that the lagrangian velocity is known to follow gaussian distribution to a very good accuracy while the lagrangian acceleration follows highly non - gaussian distribution which is related to extremely intermittent character of the acceleration , with pronounced central peak and relatively frequent acceleration bursts up to 80 standard deviations .",
    "we note that , theoretically , time derivative of a dynamical variable does not necessarily follow the same statistical distribution as that of the variable .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the obtained results and make conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present only a brief sketch of the 1d ldn model and refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ; see also ref .",
    "this toy model can also be viewed as a passive scalar in a compressible 1d flow .",
    "the main assumption of the ldn approach to the 3d navier - stokes turbulence is to introduce and separate large - scale and small - scale parts in the 3d navier - stokes equation by using the gabor transformation  @xcite .",
    "this allows to consider analytically small - scale turbulence coupled to large - scale terms ( the inter - scale coupling ) .",
    "the approach allows one to account for nonlocal interactions which were argued to be important in understanding intermittency in developed turbulent flows .",
    "the other , large - scale , part of the equation can be treated separately ( and , in principle , solved numerically given the forcing and boundary conditions ) since the forcing is characterized by presumably narrow range of small wave numbers , and the small scales make little effect on it .",
    "small - scale interactions are modeled by a turbulent viscosity and were shown numerically to make small contribution to the anomalous scaling ( intermittency ) in the decaying turbulence .",
    "nevertheless , these are important when fitting model distribution to the experimental data .",
    "the 3d ldn model of small scale turbulence was used to formulate simplified 1d ldn model , which was studied both in the eulerian and lagrangian frames  @xcite .",
    "we use probability density function obtained as a stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation that corresponds to a consideration of statistically stationary state ; statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the 3d flow is assumed as well .",

    "bigger @xmath49 and @xmath50 means bigger contribution of the velocity derivative tensor and the inter - scale coupling ( both viewed here as short - time autocorrelated processes ) to the small - scale dynamics .",
    "the model ( [ noises ] ) puts an obvious limitation but is partially justified by dns in the laboratory frame of reference  @xcite .",
    "the averaging is made over ensemble realizations .",
    "zero means correspond to isotropy of the forces .",
    "physically , the small scales are thus assumed to be stochastically distorted by much larger scales . we stress that a correlation between the noises @xmath52 and @xmath53 is not ad hoc assumption but a consequence of their structure as they contain the same large - scale velocity serving as a unifying agent between the noises .",
    "it should be emphasized that the 1d ldn toy model and its particular case ( [ langevinlaval ] ) have several limitations related to the ldn separation of small and large scales allowing to study exclusively nonlocal effects associated to the linear process of distortions of small scales by a strain produced by large scales , the use of model turbulent viscosity , and one - dimensionality .    in the lagrangian frame",

    "thus , one makes a closure by treating the combined effect of large scales , for which one has a different dynamical ldn equation that could be in principle solved numerically  @xcite , and nonlocal inter - scale coupling , as a pair of given external noises .",
    "the large - scale dynamics is local in wave number space and hence it is weakly affected by the small scales .",
    "the price of the simplification ( [ noises ] ) is that one introduces free parameters to the description .",

    "one way when comparing the model with the experiment is to make a direct fit of the obtained pdf ( [ plaval ] ) to the experimental data on unconditional acceleration distribution by assuming all the parameters and wave number to be constant .",
    "particularly , this implies a reduction of the original 1d ldn model since wave number is taken to be fixed so that the artificial 1d compressibility aimed to model rdt stretching effect in 1d case is not considered .",
    "we note that the lagrangian acceleration is usually associated to the dissipative scale , and in the present paper we do not study dependence of the parameters on the wave number .",
    "such a dependence for velocity increments was analyzed in ref .",

    "was found to be proportional to cross - correlation parameter , in accord to a kind of generalized krmn - howarth relationship  @xcite .",
    "however , the approximation based on constant parameters does not allow one to consider both the conditional and unconditional acceleration statistics .",

    "( [ plaval ] ) to be dependent on random velocity fluctuations .",
    "this extension is compatible with the 3d ldn approach as @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend on velocity fluctuations and contain large - scale quantities due to their definitions  @xcite .",

    "two well separated timescales in the lagrangian velocity increment autocorrelation have been established both by experiments and dns  @xcite .",

    "this skewness may be associated to the eulerian downscale skewness generation , which despite of being small for homogeneous flows is known to be of a fundamental character in the inertial range ( kolmogorov four - fifths law ) , since the eulerian @xmath100 was found to be proportional to cross - correlation parameter .",
    "we stress that the observed very small skewness of acceleration distribution is attributed to the effect of anisotropy of the studied flow .",
    "how the large - scale asymmetry affects smallest scales of the flow is an interesting problem .",
    "our fit made by using nonzero @xmath51 is of an illustrative character , to verify whether it can explain the observed increase of the conditional mean acceleration with increasing velocity depicted in fig .",
    "this issue will be discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "contribution to the kurtosis , @xmath35 .",
    "same notation as in fig .",
    "[ fig5].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the following remarks are in order .",
    "our finding is that the condition @xmath101 provides a convergence of @xmath95 .",
    "also , @xmath90 should not be small to provide assumed condition @xmath102 at arbitrary @xmath27 ( the cross correlation is small as compared to both noise intensities @xmath50 and @xmath49 )  @xcite .",
    "we used these criteria when making the fits .    the resulting sample",
    "fit values are given by @xmath103 with @xmath86 and @xmath62 .",
    "the theoretical curves in figs .",
    "[ fig2][fig7 ] are shown for this sample set of values , which require a further fine tuning .",
    "such a small value of @xmath51 as compared to @xmath50 or @xmath49 is in agreement with that obtained in the ldn direct numerical simulations .",
    "the calculated flatness factor @xmath104 of @xmath95 is in agreement with the experimental value 55 @xmath105 8 .    to summarize , the considered navier - stokes equation based 1d toy model ( [ plaval])-([alphalambda ] ) is capable to fit all the available high - precision experimental data on the conditional and unconditional lagrangian acceleration statistics  @xcite with the single set of parameters ( [ fits ] ) to a good accuracy , with an exception being only the conditional mean acceleration .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that at the values of fit parameters ( [ fits ] ) the predicted conditional mean acceleration @xmath94 qualitatively is in agreement but does not reproduce the experimental data .",
    "namely , it is nonzero due to nonzero @xmath51 and increases with the increase of @xmath31 but remains to be very small even at high values of @xmath31 .",
    "the conditional mean acceleration is evidently zero for a symmetrical distribution ( @xmath69 ) and should be zero for statistically homogeneous isotropic turbulence .",
    "the observed departure from zero is thought to reflect anisotropy of the studied flow albeit the dns of homogeneous isotropic turbulence also reveals slightly nonzero mean  @xcite .    to reduce the discrepancy , we have tried the value @xmath106 instead of @xmath107 to provide faster increase of @xmath108 for higher @xmath31 .",
    "this implies a good fit to the experimental conditional mean acceleration ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) but we found an excess asymmetry of @xmath79 at high @xmath27 , with big departure from observations , and divergencies when calculating @xmath95 .",
    "the reason of the divergency is that @xmath77 at @xmath106 grows faster than @xmath76 at @xmath109 so that @xmath51 becomes comparable or bigger than @xmath50 with increasing @xmath27 , and when @xmath110 the function @xmath111 defined by eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) undergoes unbound growth .",
    "thus we conclude that the observed conditional mean acceleration is mainly due to the flow anisotropy effect rather than some intrinsic dynamical mechanism associated to the developed turbulence .",
    "in general one observes a rather small relative increase of the conditional mean acceleration for higher @xmath31 that eventually reflects a coupling of the acceleration to large scales of the studied flow  @xcite .",
    "this coupling could be accounted also by introducing a correlation between the acceleration and velocity fluctuations .",
    "this possibility is of much interest to explore as it may yield the deficient increase of @xmath94 but it is beyond the scope of the present formalism , which assumes an independent velocity statistics .",
    "we note also that in contrast to the experimental data on the variance @xmath38 the experimental @xmath80 exhibits small asymmetry with respect to @xmath112 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    in the present paper , the multiplicative noise intensity @xmath49 was taken to be independent on the velocity fluctuations @xmath27 .",
    "the effect of variation of @xmath49 has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite with the qualitative result that it does not provide the specific change in shape of @xmath79 observed in experiments .",
    "however , a weak dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath27 can not be ruled out .    in summary ,",
    "the presented 1d ldn type stochastic toy model with the velocity - dependent additive noise intensity and cross correlation parameter is shown to capture main features of the observed conditional and unconditional lagrangian acceleration statistics to a good accuracy except for the discrepancy in the conditional mean acceleration which can be attributed to certain coupling of the acceleration to large scales of the studied flow .",
    "the main result is of course not only good sample fits which are important to test performance of the model but also certain advance in understanding of the mechanism of lagrangian intermittency provided by the dynamical laval - dubrulle - nazarenko approach to small - scale turbulence .",
    "the central point is that the ldn toy model has a strong deductive support from the navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "the obtained exact analytic result for the conditional acceleration distribution and the use of recent high - precision lagrangian experimental data on conditional and unconditional acceleration statistics provide a detailed analysis of the mechanism within the adopted framework .",
    "effects of large timescales ( nonlocality ) and turbulent viscosity ( nonlinearity ) have been found of much importance in lagrangian acceleration steady - state statistics .",
    "the detailed study of conditional acceleration statistics have revealed a specific model structure of the external large - scale dynamics and nonlocal inter - scale coupling for homogeneous high - reynolds - number flows .",
    "the additive noise associated to the downscale energy transfer mechanism encodes the main contribution to the velocity dependence of the acceleration statistics .",
    "the cross correlation between the model additive and multiplicative noises associated to a correlation between stretching and vorticity naturally provides a skewness of distributions and a nonzero mean .",
    "weakness of this correlation is a theoretical requirement that meets the lagrangian and eulerian experiments and dns of homogeneous isotropic turbulence .",
    "the observed conditional mean acceleration is mainly related to the flow anisotropy .",
    "the cross correlation is related to the four - fifths kolmogorov law but the effect of skewness is negligibly small as the result of relatively large intensity of the additive noise , which tends to symmetrize acceleration distributions .",
    "this is a dynamical evidence implied by the model rather than a direct consequence of a priori assumption on isotropy in the spirit of kolmogorov 1941 theory .",
    "the use of exponential dependence of certain noise parameters on statistically independent gaussian distributed lagrangian velocity fluctuations has been found appropriate to cover new experimental data on conditional statistics and to transfer from the conditional to unconditional acceleration distribution both exhibiting a strong lagrangian intermittency of the flow .",
    "such a dependence is also compatible with the log - normal statistics assumed by the kolmogorov 1962 theory .",
    "the gaussian white - in - time multiplicative noise and longtime correlated intensity of the additive noise were both found to make an essential contribution to intermittent bursts .",
