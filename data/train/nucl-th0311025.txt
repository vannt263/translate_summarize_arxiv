    "it was realized only recently that the nuclear modification factor defined as @xmath4 may be a very useful quantity which could shed more light on the dynamics of high - energy nuclear collisions @xcite . in the above definition @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "are hadron rapidity , transverse momentum , and nominal @xmath8 center - of - mass energy , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions usually calculated in the glauber formalism .",
    "this brings in a small model dependence in the above definition . the index @xmath10 indicates the measured hadron .",
    "quite different values of nuclear modification factors have been observed at cern sps @xcite and at the brookhaven rhic @xcite .",
    "it is speculated that the inequality @xmath11 is due to the creation at rhic of a dense nuclear medium , a new state of matter , perhaps the long seeked quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "various nuclear effects like shadowing , parton multiple scattering or final state quenching @xcite modify the dependence of @xmath0 on the transverse momentum and collision energy in quite different ways . in",
    "ref.@xcite the data from cern sps were interpreted within the picture of glauber multiple scattering of initial partons ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is not easy to make a priori predictions based on this effect as one has to model parton - nucleon interaction .",
    "the proposed schematic models are flexible enough so that a rough description of the data is possible .    in a partonic approach",
    "improved for including internal transverse momenta @xcite , the average transverse momentum of partons in nuclear collisions is increased compared to the one in the elementary collisions @xmath12 the correction term used in the phenomenological analyses is typically a fraction of gev , i.e. of the order of the nuclear fermi momentum .    at intermediate energies",
    "the inclusion of momentum distributions in nuclei quantifying the nucleon motion is crucial for the production of kaons @xcite , eta mesons @xcite and antiprotons @xcite in p+a collisions .",
    "it is well known that at subthreshold and near - to - threshold collisions the fermi motion leads to a huge enhancement of hadron production cross sections based on the first collision model . at the lower energies the inclusion of the off - shell effects incorporated through spectral functions",
    "( see for example @xcite ) can be numerically important .    at large energies one",
    "is tempted to completely ignore the effect of the fermi motion of nucleons in the colliding nuclei . according to our knowledge ,",
    "however , no quantitative estimates have been presented so far in the literature .    in the present letter",
    "we wish to show that the fermi motion effect on @xmath13 is not negligible even at high energies ( w @xmath14 15 gev ) and must be included into consideration , e.g. in the context of the discussion on the creation of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "in order to demonstrate our main point , in the following we shall neglect all nuclear effects except the nucleon fermi motion .",
    "we assume that the collision of nuclei @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be considered as the collision of two ensambles of nucleons . in general , the production cross section of a hadron @xmath10 depends on the type of the collision ( @xmath17 = pp , pn , np or nn ) .",
    "we assume that at these high energies all off - shell effects can be neglected . in this somewhat simplified picture the cross section _ per elementary collision _ in the definition of the nuclear modification factor ( [ r_aa ] ) . ]",
    "is @xmath18 in the above equation @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 denote rapidity , transverse momentum and energy in the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass system , respectively . the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( overall cm system ) are obtained from @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath19 , @xmath26 , etc .",
    ", via appropriate lorentz transformations and rotations of the frame of reference . in eq.([master_formula_1 ]",
    ") @xmath27 is the nucleon momentum in the rest frame of the nucleus @xmath28 , while @xmath29 is the nucleon momentum in the rest frame of the nucleus @xmath30 .",
    "eq.([master_formula_1 ] ) is valid provided the standard normalization of momentum distributions is used @xmath31 in the master formula ( [ master_formula_1 ] ) , @xmath32 is the effective number of the collisions between nucleons @xmath33 and @xmath34 . obviously @xmath35 . in the most naive approach @xmath36 .    in our intentionally simplified approach",
    "we consider the nucleus - nucleus collision as a collision of two bunches of nucleons . for simplicity",
    "we make no distinction between proton - proton , proton - neutron , neutron - proton and neutron - neutron collisions .. this is roughly true for example for h= @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 . ] in addition , we shall make simplifications of kinematics relevant at high energies , when collective velocities of both nuclei are much larger than the fermi velocity , i.e. @xmath40 . in this case @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "then , the invariant distribution ( per elementary collision ) of hadron @xmath10 in nuclear collisions is given as @xmath43 in the formula above , @xmath21 denotes the energy available in the elementary nucleon - nucleon collision . in order to calculate @xmath21",
    "one needs to make the appropriate lorentz transformations from four momenta in the rest frame of nuclei @xmath44 to four - momenta in the overall center of mass of the colliding nuclei @xmath45 . then the nucleon - nucleon c.m .",
    "energy is calculated as @xmath46 in the equation above the on - shell relation @xmath47 ( @xmath48=1,2 ) is used .",
    "due to plateau at midrapidities , at @xmath49 0 it seems reasonable to make an extra approximation @xmath50 .",
    "although the master formula ( [ master_formula_2 ] ) is very simple , its practical application requires knowledge of nucleon momentum distributions ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) in nuclei as well as the rapidity , transverse momentum and energy dependence of the elementary production mechanism .",
    "it is needless to say that realistic calculation of both nucleon momentum distribution in nuclei and differential cross section for elementary collisions is rather difficult .",
    "while the first requires nuclear many - body approach to the nucleus structure , the latter involves nonperturbative qcd effects which are not fully understood .",
    "the exact nuclear calculation based on modern nucleon - nucleon interactions are available only for the deuteron , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and quite recently  the four - nucleon system @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "similarly , our understanding of the soft sector ( small transverse momenta ) of particle production within qcd is still not complete @xcite .",
    "before we go to the presentation of predictions based on eq.([master_formula_2 ] ) , we shall shortly describe the ingredients which enter the formula . in the fermi gas model @xmath56 where @xmath57 is fermi momentum and @xmath58",
    "is the standard step function .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath59 can be obtained from the normalization condition ( [ normalization_condition ] ) . in numerical calculations",
    "we take @xmath57 = 1.37 @xmath60 . in the present paper",
    "we shall also consider a simple gaussian parametrization of the momentum distribution of nucleons in @xmath61 nucleus from ref.@xcite .",
    "while the first seems more adequate for heavy nuclei , the latter may be representative for light nuclei .",
    "the elementary cross sections for the production of @xmath62 in the proton - proton or proton - antiproton collisions are know experimentally in the broad range of energies . as mentioned above , in the present analysis we shall limit ourselves to the production of @xmath37 only . for our purpose",
    "a simple parametrization of the available world data would be useful .",
    "such a parametrization exists , however , only for charged particles in the limited range of energies @xcite . in the parton picture , assuming isospin symmetry , the invariant cross section for the @xmath63 reaction can be expressed as @xmath64 the effects which violate the above relation are expected to be sufficiently small . in the present calculation",
    "we use a parametrization of the isr data from ref.@xcite .    in general , there are three effects contained in the original convolution formula ( [ master_formula_1 ] ) which may result in fermi motion modifying of @xmath65 .",
    "the first effect is connected to the fact that @xmath66 .",
    "the second effect is related to the fact that @xmath67 . because the general lorentz transformation from the nn system to the overall nucleus - nucleus cm system includes also rotations of the frame axes , the formulae are rather cumbersome and not easy to reverse .",
    "therefore these two effects can not be included exactly in a simple way .",
    "the monte carlo method seems more suitable for this purpose .",
    "a monte carlo calculation , to be discussed in details elsewhere , shows that while the first effect is rather small , the second effect is almost negligible .",
    "the main ( third ) effect is connected to the fact that the true c.m .",
    "energy in the elementary nucleon - nucleon collision is not equal to the nominal nucleon - nucleon energy @xmath68 , even when averaged over fermi distributions . as an example , in fig.[fig : w_spectrum ] we show two distributions of the true nucleon - nucleon center of mass energy @xmath69 = 1 . ] for two nominal energies @xmath7 = 20 gev ( left panel ) and @xmath7 = 50 gev ( right panel ) .",
    "we observe a broadening of @xmath21 distribution with raising nominal energy , although the relative dispersion @xmath70 stays roughly constant .",
    "the invariant elementary cross sections for particle production rise across the region over which @xmath69 is spread ( see fig.[fig : pt_w ] ) leading to the value of @xmath71 indicates averaging of @xmath21 with the energy - dependent @xmath72 cross section .",
    "] larger than @xmath7 .",
    "this effect is stronger for larger @xmath20 and smaller energies @xmath21 .    in fig.[fig :",
    "raa_wa98 ] we show @xmath73 as a function of the @xmath37 transverse momentum for the @xmath37 rapidity y=0 and two different fermi momentum distributions : + ( a ) fermi gas model distribution given by eq.([fermi_gas ] ) ( dashed ) and + ( b ) the gaussian parametrization from ref.@xcite ( solid ) . + the experimental data points were obtained by dividing the nuclear data from ref.@xcite by the cross section for the elementary collision obtained with the help of eq.([sigma_pp_pi0 ] ) and the parametrization from @xcite .    the fermi motion effect calculated from our master formula ( [ master_formula_2 ] )",
    "is strongly energy dependent , which is demonstrated in fig.[fig : raa_w ] .",
    "generally , the larger energy the smaller the effect .",
    "surprisingly , the effect of the fermi motion stays present even up to w = 50 gev .    in the present analysis",
    "we have estimated the effect of fermi motion assuming that nucleons can be treated as free on - mass - shell particles . under this assumption",
    "the light - cone fraction carried by a nucleon , @xmath74 , defined so that 0@xmath75a , is @xmath76 . as a result the average @xmath77 is larger than 1 and the momentum sum rule is violated - nucleons carry momenta larger than the total nucleus momentum .",
    "effectively the energy in nn collisions is overestimated .",
    "this is connected with the effect of nucleon binding in nuclei .",
    "the problem can be even better seen in the nucleus rest frame , where the total nucleon - gas energy is larger than the nucleus mass @xmath78 i.e. the gas of nucleons has too large energy .",
    "this effect can be cured introducing effective nucleon mass @xmath79 : @xmath80 this corresponds to the reduction of the nucleon mass by 10 - 20% .",
    "can the binding effect change our conclusions ?",
    "the binding effect in nuclei is in general a complicated multiparticle problem and was solved in the exact way essentially only for three- and four - nucleon systems .",
    "the binding effect in heavy nuclei can be approximately included by introducing a notion of nucleon effective mass in the relation @xmath81 .",
    "since the binding effect is only a correction to our main effect of fermi motion this approach seems justified .",
    "for illustration in fig.[fig : binding ] we show the result for nominal energy w = 20 gev with nucleon mass modified by @xmath82 150 mev .",
    "this figure shows that the binding effect is not only qualitatively but also quantitatively a correction to our effect .",
    "this correction does not change the main trend of @xmath13 .",
    "a more refined calculation is not our intention and clearly goes beyond the scope of the present paper .    how does the effect of fermi motion depend on the type of particle measured ?",
    "in fig.[fig : raa_particles ] we present @xmath0 for @xmath38 ( solid ) , @xmath83 ( dashed ) and @xmath84 ( dotted ) at the center - of - mass energy @xmath7 = 20 gev and @xmath5 = 0 . in this calculation fermi gas model",
    "the results for pions and kaons are similar , while the result for protons+antiprotons are somewhat different .",
    "the latter does not show the enhancement at large transverse momenta observed for pions and kaons .",
    "this is due to the parametrization for protons and antiprotons @xcite which is practically energy independent .",
    "perhaps the difference for protons+antiprotons and pions / kaons can be used to identify experimentally the fermi motion effect .    in the present letter",
    "we have concentrated only on the effect of fermi motion on nuclear modification factor .",
    "the fermi motion in colliding nuclei is probably important in many other fixed - target ( low energy ) processes .",
    "for example global partonic qcd analyses use drell - yan data based on rather low - energy proton - nucleus collisions than elementary ones .",
    "the standard qcd approach is known to have problems in describing the transverse momentum distribution of the lepton pair . in such analyses the fermi motion of nucleons in nuclei is completely ignored .",
    "we expect that the effect of the fermi motion should be dependent on the invariant mass of the two leptons . in general , the larger invariant mass , the larger fermi motion effect may be expected . from the experience of the present paper",
    "one may expect large effects close to kinematical limits . therefore even for the production of heavy gauge bosons ( w , z ) in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic one may expect sizeable effect due to the fermi motion .",
    "these effects were never discussed in the literature and await a quantitative analysis .",
    "finally we wish to mention another interesting , not fully explained , effect related to the ceres collaboration measurement of the elliptic flow parameter @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the existing hydrodynamical or thermodynamical models have serious problems in explaining a saturation of @xmath85 observed at larger transverse momenta ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "it is quite probably that the fermi motion effect may play important role in the full understanding of this effect .",
    "however , this effect is very subtle and requires the inclusion of many effects in addition to the nucleon fermi motion .",
    "this clearly goes beyond the scope of the present , intentionally simplified , analysis .",
    "for the first time in the literature , in the present letter we have analysed the role of the fermi motion in nuclei in modyfing the so - called nuclear modification factor @xmath0 .",
    "a large effect is found even at sps energies .",
    "the details depend on the model of the fermi motion as well as on the cross sections for elementary collisions .",
    "the latter are very difficult to calculate reliably , especially at low transverse momenta .",
    "therefore we have made use of a parametrization of existing experimental data .",
    "this quantitative difference of the role of the fermi motion at low and high energies is very important in the context of a quantitative understanding of jet quenching in dense nuclear media like quark - gluon plasma . at present the latter",
    "can not be calculated from first principles and the model parameters are extracted by comparison to the experimental data .    even when alone , the fermi motion leads to the cronin effect .",
    "different mechanisms like parton multiple scattering @xcite , initial transverse momentum broadening in nuclei @xcite or perturbative saturation of gluon distributions @xcite can contribute to the cronin effect too .",
    "our analysis shows that the fermi motion effect is very important and must be included into the analysis before reliable conclusions about other nuclear effects may be drawn from such phenomenological studies .",
    "we find @xmath87 which makes the interpretation of the experimental data even more complicated .",
    "for example at the sps energy w=17.4 gev the inclusion of the fermi motion would improve the agreement of the calculation in ref.@xcite with the wa98 collaboration experimental data ( see their fig.3 ) .",
    "however , the inclusion of all effects like shadowing , quenching and fermi motion in one consistent framework seems rather difficult at present .",
    "the fermi motion effect seems to be one of a few different competing mechanisms modyfing @xmath0 .",
    "can one isolate experimentally the fermi motion effect better ?",
    "we think that the role of fermi motion can be pinned down better in the collisions of light nuclei , where other effects are suppressed and the nucleon momentum distribution can be calculated from realistic models of nucleon - nucleon interactions . the examples are @xmath88 or @xmath89 scattering measured already in the past ( see for example @xcite ) . better precision data at sps energies would help to identify the effect of the fermi motion via a comparison with realistic theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "also very precise data on elementary collisions would be helpful when calculating the modification of @xmath0 precisely .",
