    "let us consider a classical spin-1/2 ising system with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interactions , in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath2 , on a finite @xmath1-dimensional lattice of @xmath3 sites .",
    "the partition function can be written as @xmath4 .",
    "\\label{isipf}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 denotes an ising spin variable associated to the site @xmath6 of the lattice .",
    "the first sum extends to all configurations of the spins , the second to all distinct pairs @xmath7 of nearest - neighbor spins , the third to all spins .",
    "we have set @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the temperature , @xmath10 the exchange coupling of the spins , @xmath11 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath12 the reduced magnetic field .",
    "it is a classical result@xcite that , for real @xmath9 , @xmath13 has a sequence of zeroes that can occur only on the imaginary axis of the complex @xmath14 plane .",
    "this statement remains true for a wide variety of models with ferromagnetic couplings , including ising models of arbitrary spin@xcite , @xmath15-vector models@xcite ( at least for @xmath16 ) , etc .. as long as the number @xmath3 of sites remains finite , these zeroes give rise to a sequence of logarithmic branch - points of the free energy . for @xmath9 above its critical value @xmath17 , when the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 is taken , these cuts coalesce into two continuous lines of singularities along the imaginary axis of the @xmath19-plane that extend to infinity and originate at the `` yang - lee(yl ) edges '' , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the partition function must then be nonzero and the free energy must be analytic in a strip containing the real axis of the complex reduced field plane , so that no phase transition can occur for @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 , so the gap between the endpoints of the singularity lines shrinks and they tend to pinch the real axis of the complex field plane giving rise , for @xmath25 , to the characteristic discontinuity associated with the spontaneous magnetization .    at fixed @xmath26 , in the vicinity of a yl edge",
    ", the magnetization per spin is expected to exhibit a power - law behavior@xcite @xmath27 controlled by an exponent @xmath28 .",
    "the main features of these yl edge - singularities have been extensively studied . _ a priori _ the exponent @xmath28 might depend on the temperature and the particular features of the model , however it was observed that it is universal , i.e. it depends only on the spatial dimensionality , but not on the structure of the lattice on which the spin model is defined .",
    "moreover , due to the presence of the magnetic field , this exponent does not depend on the number of components of the spin .",
    "hence for an @xmath15-vector ferromagnetic system , it must be the same as for an ising system . finally , the study of solvable models in one dimension or for @xmath29 ( the mean - field model ) or , for any dimension , in the @xmath30 limit ( the spherical model ) , and finally the numerical study@xcite of non - trivial ising systems in @xmath31 and @xmath32 dimensions , indicates that , for @xmath33 , the exponents @xmath34 are temperature - independent . due to these universality features , the properties of the yl edges have been related@xcite to those of the ordinary critical points in the theory of second - order phase transitions . in this respect ,",
    "an important step forward was to show that a renormalization - group approach to the calculation of the exponent @xmath28 can be formulated@xcite in terms of an effective landau - ginzburg one - component scalar field theory with a cubic interaction and a purely imaginary coupling .",
    "this entails the upper critical dimensionality @xmath35 , at and above which the exponent takes its mean - field value @xmath36 .",
    "moreover @xmath28 can be expressed as an expansion in powers of @xmath37 , whose coefficients have been so far computed@xcite through the third order .",
    "see eq.([sigmaeps ] ) below .",
    "the interest of an accurate determination of @xmath38 is enhanced by the realization that the yl edge exponent is also related to other exponents characterizing the behavior of several quite different systems :    \\a ) the pressure for @xmath1-dimensional fluids , with repulsive - core interactions among their constituents , exhibits an unphysical singularity located at negative values of the activity and showing universal exponents@xcite @xmath39 .",
    "a similar property is true for lattice systems of hard squares ( and higher - dimensional solids ) .",
    "\\b ) the number - per - site of directed branched polymers with @xmath40 bonds ( or of directed site- or bond - animals@xcite of size @xmath40 ) on a @xmath1-dimensional lattice , has a scaling behavior characterized by a power of @xmath40 with universal exponent@xcite @xmath41 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the directed branched polymers has been mapped@xcite into that of the aforementioned fluids at the unphysical singularity , in one fewer space dimension .",
    "\\c ) the universal exponents characterizing the behavior of the number - per - site of large isotropic branched polymers@xcite in a good solvent ( or , equivalently@xcite , of undirected site- or bond - animals ) on a @xmath1-dimensional lattice can be expressed as @xmath42 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the isotropically branched polymers has been mapped@xcite into that , mentioned above , of the fluids in two fewer dimensions .",
    "\\d ) a field theoretic model@xcite of the anderson localization exhibits the same critical behavior as the isotropic branched polymers mentioned above in c )",
    ".    refs .",
    "[ ] provide us with tables of numerical estimates of these exponents for the systems of a ) , b ) and c ) in spatial dimensionalities @xmath43 , which corroborate these exponent identifications .",
    "in particular , estimates of the exponent @xmath44 for high - dimensional undirected site - animals have been obtained from 15th - order activity expansions@xcite , and , more recently , have been complemented by extensive montecarlo simulations@xcite and exact enumerations@xcite .",
    "we have recently calculated@xcite , in most cases through 24th order , the high - temperature(ht ) and low - field expansion of the magnetization in an external field for several models in the ising universality class , including the conventional ising spin-1/2 model , on a sequence of bipartite lattices of spatial dimensionalities @xmath45 . in this paper",
    ", we shall use these data , most not yet existing in the literature , to improve the accuracy and extend the range of direct estimates of the exponents of the yl edge - singularity .",
    "our work is based on the observation@xcite that this task can be accomplished restricting to the study of the ising magnetization in a particular ht limit , since the exponents @xmath38 are temperature - independent .",
    "it was shown that , in this limit , for each value of @xmath1 , the bivariate expansion of the magnetization in powers of the inverse temperature at low field reduces to a simpler univariate expansion of a quantity related to the density of a dimer system on the same lattice , in powers of a variable @xmath46 that can be viewed as the activity of the dimers .",
    "hence , the estimates of the exponents @xmath38 can be obtained from the simpler study of a singularity in the complex @xmath46-plane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "we describe briefly the dimer model and sketch the arguments relating the ising magnetization and the dimer density . in the third section",
    ", we discuss the numerical estimates of the exponents @xmath38 . in the fourth section",
    ", we briefly mention the possibility of obtaining accurate estimates of the dimer constants from the dimer series for several lattices . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our work and draw some conclusions .",
