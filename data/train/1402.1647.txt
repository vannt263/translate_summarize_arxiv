    "the topic of this paper is partonic energy loss in high energy hard collisions .",
    "the type of process we have in mind is exemplified by forward jet production in proton- ( or deuterium- ) nucleus collisions .",
    "for example , in comparing proton - nucleus collisions with proton - proton collisions to extract information on high energy nuclear shadowing @xcite it is important to understand , as emphasized by frankfurt and strikman @xcite , how much additional energy loss leading partons suffer in proton - nucleus collisions as compared with proton - proton collisions . also , recently arleo and peign @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) have done a detailed phenomenological analysis of forward @xmath1 suppression at fixed target energies and suggest that the key to their successful description is additional energy loss of the leading gluon ( which converts to a charm - anticharm pair eventually becoming the @xmath1 ) in nuclear targets as compared to proton targets .",
    "the issues surrounding energy loss in these examples are not closely related to the energy loss of jets produced in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite . in the heavy ion case",
    "the jets are produced as bare quanta in a qcd medium and the energy loss is limited to a factor times @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the transport coefficient and @xmath4 is the length of ( hot ) qcd matter that the jets transverse . in forward jet or quarkonium production a dressed parton approaches the target and it is the additional energy lost by this dressed parton due to the nuclear target which is at issue .",
    "recently , arleo and peign have given convincing first principle arguments that the additional energy loss caused by nuclear targets in forward jet or quarkonium production should scale linearly with the energy of the beam .",
    "energy loss growing linearly with beam energy has also been advocated in other analyses of these processes @xcite , however in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time a first - principles calculation of the exact form and magnitude of the spectrum of energy losses induced by nuclear targets has been given .",
    "the process considered in ref .",
    "@xcite was very high energy @xmath1 production .",
    "the picture is that a gluon coming from the proton projectile converts into a charm - anticharm pair , either well before or well after reaching the nucleus .",
    "the charm - anticharm pair ultimately becomes a quarkonium state , but the essential calculation is that of the additional energy lost by the gluon or the charm - anticharm pair due to having a nuclear as opposed to a proton target .",
    "in fact the conversion of the gluon into the charm - anticharm pair was not dealt with in ref .",
    "rather the hard process , where the gluon converts into a charm - anticharm pair , was simulated by a hard scattering of the incoming gluon , at the scale of the charm mass , and then a calculation was given for the difference , between nuclear and proton targets , of the probability that an additional softer gluon be radiated .",
    "in [ sec : qqjet ] we revisit the gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark process , with either light - quark jets or heavy - quarks being produced .",
    "the nucleus is treated in a mclerran - venugopalan approximation @xcite .",
    "while the details of our calculation look quite different from those of arleo and peign , our result given in [ eq : radspec , eq : radspecqs ] exactly reproduces their result . at the end of this section",
    "we indicate that small-@xmath6 evolution can trivially be added to extend the mclerran - venugopalan model with the saturation momenta of the nucleus @xmath7 and the proton @xmath8 being the only parameters that enter the calculation .    in [ sec :",
    "qgjet ] we extend our calculation from gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark to quark @xmath5 quark - gluon jet production .",
    "the calculational procedure follows that of [ sec : qqjet ] and the result is given in [ eq : radspecqgone , eq : radspecqgtwo ] .",
    "the result here is very close to our calculation in [ sec : qqjet ] with the @xmath9 in [ eq : radspec ] being replaced by @xmath10 in [ eq : radspecqgone ] .",
    "this is , perhaps , surprising as there appears to be no simple relationship between the color charges of the initial and final partons and the prefactors of our results .",
    "the reason why there is no simple rule is explained at the end of [ sec : qgjet ] . using the quark @xmath5 quark - gluon processes as an example we also estimate the _ typical _ additional energy loss , @xmath11 , with a nuclear as opposed to a proton target and find @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the initiating quark s energy .",
    "we note that our rhic estimate is very similar to that obtained by frankfurt and strikman @xcite .",
    "in [ sec : quarkonium ] we briefly discuss energy loss in quarkonium production in the color evaporation model @xcite .",
    "we have very little to say here since our technical result is the same as that of ref .",
    "@xcite and they have already done the detailed phenomenology .    in [ sec : colorsinglet ] we consider nuclear induced energy loss in a color singlet model of quarkonium production .",
    "as originally emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) in production on nuclei it is relatively easy to get the three or more gluons ( one from the projectile and two or more from the nuclear target ) interacting with the charm - anticharm pair so that it can have the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 .",
    "however , this is not the case for a proton target .",
    "thus in our discussion of singlet model production of quarkonium it is not natural to discuss nuclear minus proton target differences .",
    "what we calculate is the energy loss spectrum @xmath15 for @xmath1 production on a nucleus .",
    "we separate two cases . in [ eq : radspeccolorsingletone ] we give the spectrum in case @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the charm mass , is less than 1 while in [ eq : radspeccolorsinglettwo ] we give the spectrum when @xmath18 .",
    "we estimate @xmath19 in both cases , and it should be remembered that now we refer to absolute energy losses not differences between nuclear and proton targets .    finally , some general comments on the limitations of our calculation . to begin , our calculation is made in a logarithmic approximation .",
    "that is values of @xmath20 in @xmath15 must be small enough that there is a significant logarithmic integration in the transverse momentum ( coordinate ) of the radiated gluon . in the end",
    "we find typical values of @xmath21 small enough that this logarithmic approximation is not unreasonable , but like all leading logarithmic calculations it can not be expected to be very reliable . for simplicity , we have only considered the case where the produced jets have the same longitudinal momentum .",
    "we do not expect large changes so long as their longitudinal momenta are comparable . also , in some respects our discussion of energy loss is complementary to recent discussions of transverse momentum broadening effects in similar processes @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall evaluate the energy loss in gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark jet production in proton - nucleus collisions . to simplify the calculation we shall use the large @xmath0 approximation as the multiple scattering with the nucleus appears difficult to do beyond the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "our focus is on forward two - jet production at the lhc where the transverse momentum of each jet , @xmath17 , is much greater than the saturation momentum @xmath7 .",
    "we shall begin using a simple mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite for multiple scattering with the nucleus , but at the end we shall see that small-@xmath6 evolution is very straightforward to implement as our results will be completely expressed in terms of dipole @xmath22 matrices .",
    "the calculations done in this section easily extend from the light - quark jets which we do here to heavy - quark pair production and thus to the energy loss in onium production in proton - nucleus as compared to proton - proton collisions .",
    "this then is the basic ingredient in testing the effects of energy loss in a color evaporation picture of onium production along the lines pioneered by arleo and peign @xcite .",
    "in addition to the interactions producing the two jets we include an additional radiative gluon , the source of the energy loss .",
    "we shall in turn evaluate initial state radiation in both the amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude , final state radiation in the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude , and interference terms having initial state radiation in the amplitude ( complex conjugate amplitude ) and final state radiation in the complex conjugate amplitude ( amplitude ) .      before including gluon radiation",
    "there are three classes of graphs in gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark illustrated in [ fig : twojets ] .",
    "graphs in class @xmath23 , [ fig : a ] , correspond to interaction of the gluon initiating the process with the nucleus indicated by the small circle in the graph .",
    "graphs in class @xmath24 , [ fig : c ] , have the quark - antiquark interacting with the nucleus while in class @xmath25 , [ fig : b ] , the quark - antiquark in the amplitude and the gluon in the complex conjugate amplitude interact with the nucleus . graphs in class @xmath25 will be multiplied by a factor of 2 to account for gluon interactions in the amplitude and quark - antiquark interactions in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "finally , the numbers just above the graphs indicate the emission points of the radiative gluon which are used to characterize the emission .",
    "there are three possible emission points in the amplitude , to the left of the vertical cut , and three possible emission points in the complex conjugate amplitude , to the right of the cut .",
    "emission points to the left ( right ) of the nucleus are initial state ( final state ) emissions in the amplitude while in the complex conjugate amplitude initial state ( final state ) emissions occur to the right ( left ) of the nucleus .",
    "each gluon emission graph is characterized by a letter , indicating the class , and by two numbers , the first number indicating the emission point in the amplitude and the second number the emission point in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "the gluon from the proton carries an energy @xmath14 with transverse coordinate zero both in the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "the energy of the radiated gluon is @xmath20 and its transverse coordinate is @xmath26 .",
    "for example , @xmath27 is shown in [ fig : cto ] .",
    "now let us begin to evaluate the graphs .",
    "starting with single purely initial state emission in class @xmath23 @xmath28 where the graph , in detail , is shown in [ fig : aoo ] .",
    "the integration limits on @xmath26 will be given later as will the details of our normalization .",
    "we note that interactions of the gluons passing over the nucleus cancel between inelastic and elastic scatterings off nucleons in the nucleus . to achieve the cancellation we allow the case where there may be no interaction , either of the gluon @xmath29 or of the gluon @xmath30 , with nucleons in the amplitude , in the complex conjugate amplitude , or in both the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "such `` noninteraction '' terms ultimately are canceled after all graphs are taken into account . in class @xmath25",
    "there are two purely initial state radiation contributions ,    @xmath31s(x/2)s(-x/2 )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : bb ]    where @xmath32 is the @xmath22 matrix for the scattering of a quark dipole on the nucleus in the large @xmath0 approximation and @xmath7 is the gluon saturation momentum @xmath33 for notational simplicity we have dropped the @xmath34 symbol on transverse quantities in [ eq : bb ] , which we will continue to do in the following if it does not lead to confusion .",
    "finally , for graphs in class @xmath24    @xmath35 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while @xmath36 and @xmath27 do not have logarithmic domains of integration in @xmath26 and are neglected .",
    "the integrands in [ eq : bto , eq : ctt ] can be simplified to @xmath37 and @xmath38\\simeq\\frac{2}{z^{2 } }    \\label{eq : expandtwo}\\ ] ] where we keep all terms of zeroth order or of first order in @xmath39 .",
    "( we recall that @xmath40 with @xmath17 the transverse momentum of each jet , and we always assume @xmath41 . )    the domains where logarithmic integration occurs are easily determined and given below with the various contributions having logarithmic integration listed in the corresponding domain :    @xmath42    [ eq : initialps ]    one finds @xmath43 ,    \\label{eq : initialabc}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 in the end we shall expand @xmath45 up to first order in @xmath46 but for the moment we keep the full exponential form .",
    "we note that the contributions , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , in the domains where @xmath50 should not be included here since that region of gluon emission is already in the gluon distribution of the incident proton , however , since all initial state interactions will cancel when we form the difference between the proton - nucleus and the proton - proton two - jet energy spectrum we can keep these terms without danger of double counting .",
    "we begin our calculation of purely final state radiation following what has been done for initial state radiation .",
    "thus in the region @xmath51 corresponding to times after the collision @xmath52 we have final state contributions , analogous to those given in [ eq : initialps ] , @xmath53 these contributions are    @xmath54s(x/2)s(-x/2),\\\\      c_{33}&=\\frac{\\alpha_{s}n_{c}}{2\\pi^{2}}\\int d^{2}z\\ , \\bigg[\\frac{1}{(z - x/2)^{2}}+\\frac{1}{(z+x/2)^{2}}\\bigg ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using [ eq : expandone , eq : expandtwo ] one finds @xmath55 when @xmath56 , or equivalently @xmath57 , one can no longer view the quark - antiquark jet pair as having a frozen transverse coordinate .",
    "after the scattering the separation between the quark and antiquark , @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 since @xmath60 is of size @xmath61 we see that when @xmath62 @xmath58 will generally be much larger than @xmath61 .",
    "this is the region where the decays of the jets become important .",
    "we define the quark and antiquark jets by cones of half - angle @xmath63 centered about their directions of motion .",
    "the gluon radiation spectrum additional to [ eq : finalabc ] is then given by radiation coming off the quark ( or antiquark ) at an angle @xmath64 in the interval @xmath65 where the upper limit of @xmath66 is determined by requiring the gluon formation time be equal to @xmath67 , that is @xmath68 .",
    "gluons emitted at large angle are already included in [ eq : finalabc ] .",
    "thus @xmath69 while @xmath70 it is convenient to write this as @xmath71 if the produced quark - antiquark pair are heavy quarks having mass @xmath17 then the first term on the right - hand side of [ eq : finalcom ] is absent , the @xmath64 integration going over the `` dead cone '' @xcite .",

    "also [ eq : initialabcone ] and the second term on the right - hand side of [ eq : finalcom ] are identical except for upper limits on the @xmath26 integration reflecting the fact that the final state radiation is off jets .",
    "the interference terms are straightforward to calculate , but there are many terms",

    "our real interest is in the change in the per event gluon radiation in going from a proton target to a nuclear target . without gluon radiation",
    "the three graphs @xmath85 of [ fig : twojets ] give @xmath86 if we divide our above results by [ eq : norad ] we get a per event radiation spectrum .",
    "we note some unusual terms , proportional to @xmath87 , which do not vanish when @xmath88 is set to zero .",
    "these terms are present in [ eq : initialabc , eq : finalabc , eq : crosstwo ] .",
    "a term which survives as @xmath89 is a term where no scattering with the target occurs .",
    "such terms should not be present in our final answer and , indeed , they cancel when the contributions of [ eq : initialabc , eq : finalabc , eq : crosstwo ] are added together . after this cancellation",
    "is accounted for , all remaining terms go to zero as @xmath46 when @xmath90 .",
    "we keep only the linear term in @xmath46 , appropriate to the case where @xmath41 , but we keep all powers in @xmath91 . in order to evaluate the difference of the proton - nucleus and proton - proton spectra we first divide all results by @xmath92 , as given in [ eq : norad ] , to get a normalized spectrum .",
    "the resulting initial and final state scattering terms then have no @xmath88 dependence whatsoever so they cancel in the difference between nuclear and proton targets .",
    "the interference terms given in [ eq : crossone , eq : crosstwo ] give a nonzero contribution to the difference between the spectrum for proton and nuclear targets in the region @xmath93 ,    \\label{eq : apregion}\\ ] ] where the factors of 4 in [ eq : apregion ] represent our best guess as to how numerical limits to the logarithmic integrals come in ( see [ app : ps ] ) .",
    "@xmath88 is , as always , the saturation momentum of the nucleus , and @xmath94 is the saturation momentum of the proton if @xmath6 values are small enough for the proton saturation momentum to have meaning , otherwise @xmath8 should be taken to be a hadron scale of , say , 300 to 500@xmath95 .",
    "dividing [ eq : crossone , eq : crosstwo ] by [ eq : norad ] and using the resulting expression in the region [ eq : apregion ] gives @xmath96 in case @xmath97 . in case @xmath98 one",
    "has @xmath99 a result which does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "are exactly the result of arleo and peign @xcite .",
    "so far we have treated the scattering of the incoming gluon , two gluon , quark - antiquark , or quark - antiquark gluon on the nucleus in a simple glauber approximation .",
    "however , it is easy to include qcd small-@xmath6 evolution in the gaussian approximation @xcite so long as @xmath100 .",
    "( small-@xmath6 evolution in general is not difficult to implement although numerical evaluations of dipole scattering amplitudes are required for explicit results .",
    "see below . )",
    "the result in the gaussian approximation is that one uses the formulas exactly as we have given them but @xmath88 and @xmath94 are taken to be @xmath6 dependent with @xmath101 [ see [ eq : smallxregion ] for a more precise range of @xmath6 values ] where @xmath102 is the proton mass and @xmath17 and @xmath14 are the jet transverse momentum ( heavy quark mass ) and @xmath14 the energy of the jets or heavy quarks .",
    "let us briefly indicate how this comes about .",
    "it should suffice to take graphs in class @xmath25 as shown in [ fig : twojets ] .",
    "if we view this as an amplitude rather then as a cut amplitude , which should be valid for leading and next - to - leading small-@xmath6 evolution @xcite , the amplitude can be illustrated as in [ fig : dipoleone ] .",
    "the complex conjugate amplitude in [ fig : twojets ] appears as the upper half of the graph in [ fig : dipoleone ] .",
    "the first , highest energy @xmath20 , gluon emission which accounts for the energy loss must connect the lower part of the graph in [ fig : dipoleone ] to the upper part of that graph .",
    "subsequent gluon evolution involving gluons having energy less than @xmath20 can appear anywhere in the graph .",
    "if the first gluon @xmath20 is a purely initial state emission going from regions 1 or 2 in the lower part of the graph to region 1 in the upper part of the graph then this first emission has no effect on the subsequent softer emissions .",
    "exactly the same is the case for purely final state interactions .",
    "thus , when the first gluon emission is purely initial state or purely final state the evolution is exactly as if there were no emission and thus these terms will continue to cancel when nucleus minus proton differences are taken , and this cancellation does not depend on the gaussian approximation .",
    "now consider initial - state - final - state interference graphs . as an example we take the @xmath103 term evaluated earlier and illustrated in the dipole formalism in [ fig : dipolerad ] .",
    "the system passing over the nucleus in [ fig : dipolerad ] consists of a gluon @xmath104 , a gluon @xmath105 , a quark @xmath106 and an antiquark @xmath107 . because of the large @xmath0 approximation this",
    "two gluon - quark - antiquark systems can be viewed as three independent ( quark , antiquark ) dipoles at positions @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "the scattering has the factor given by the last factor on the right - hand side of [ eq : crossfullone ] .",
    "if we take the @xmath22 matrices to be given by balitsky - kovchegov evolution ( bk ) @xcite starting from a mclerran - venugopalan initial condition then [ eq : crossfullone , eq : crossfulltwo ] are general , including evolution , in the large @xmath0 approximation .",
    "however , [ eq : expandthree , eq : qqexpand ] require the gaussian approximation .",
    "thus in the gaussian approximation we expect [ eq : crossone , eq : crosstwo ] and hence [ eq : radspec , eq : radspecqs ] to have small-@xmath6 evolution included in @xmath7 and @xmath8 while more generally small-@xmath6 evolution is included , via bk evolution , in [ eq : crossfullone , eq : crossfulltwo ] when the @xmath22 matrices are evaluated using bk evolution . in the gaussian approximation",
    "the evolution results in a saturation momentum depending on @xmath111 . for a fixed @xmath20 and @xmath112 ( see [ eq : apregion , eq : radspec ] )",
    "this leads to @xmath113 values in the region @xmath114",
    "this section is pretty much a repeat of what has just been done , but now for quark @xmath5 quark - gluon jets rather than gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark jets .",
    "of course it would be nice to simply read off the radiative spectrum results for quark @xmath5 quark - gluon in terms of those for gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark but we , so far , have not been able to find a way to do this .",
    "we are thus forced to do another detailed calculation , again in the large @xmath0 limit , for the quark initiated process .",
    "analogous to those shown in [ fig : twojets ] the relevant graphs now are shown in [ fig : qgjets ] . as in the last section we consider , in turn , purely initial state radiation , purely final state radiation and initial - state - final - state interference terms .",
    "we shall be somewhat briefer in our description of the calculations here since the general procedure is exactly as in the previous section .",

    "similarly the second term on the right - hand side of [ eq : qgctt ] corresponds to the radiated gluon being emitted and absorbed in the closed fermion ( dipole ) loop with the result being the usual dipole formula for gluon emission .",

    "referring to [ eq : initialabcone , eq : finalcom ] , and taking @xmath46 small as well as factoring out @xmath92 , the spectrum both for initial and for final state radiation is @xmath155 which looks just like bremsstrahlung from a gluon .",
    "the interference term given in [ eq : crossfullone , eq : crossone ] is @xmath156 thus one - half of the initial plus final state radiation is canceled if @xmath157 . the radiation which is emitted when @xmath158 is due to the hard collision , not due to the multiple scattering .",
    "the key to why exactly @xmath159 of the initial and final state radiation is canceled by interference lies in [ eq : crossfullone , eq : qqexpand ] . without radiation the four scattering terms in [ eq : qqexpand ] would be given by [ eq : norad ] , the factor defining the rate of scattering without radiation .",
    "the factor @xmath160 on the right - hand side of [ eq : qqexpand ] is a factor of 2 smaller accounting for the fact that only @xmath159 of the initial and final state radiation is canceled by the interference term .",
    "now to the main point .",
    "the factor of 2 difference between the @xmath92 on the right - hand side of [ eq : norad ] and the @xmath160 on the right - hand side of [ eq : qqexpand ] is not universal . in the process quark",
    "@xmath5 quark - gluon the production rate is given by the factor @xmath161 while the interference term has the scattering factor given by [ eq : acbbb ] @xmath162",
    "so now the scattering factor is reduced by a factor of @xmath163 in the interference term for radiation .",
    "this is the @xmath163 on the far right in [ eq : qgregionone ] .",
    "we do not understand why the radiation factor is @xmath163 here and @xmath159 in gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark . since it is the interference term alone which shows up in @xmath154 we are unable to see a general pattern for the radiation factors which come in for energy loss differences between nuclear and proton targets .",
    "as a final comment we note that in quark @xmath5 quark - gluon final state radiation and initial radiation are not the same [ compare the @xmath159 on the far right of [ eq : qgfullabctwo ] with the @xmath164 on the far right of [ eq : qgtotalabc ] ] in contrast to the case of gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark .",
    "now let us switch the topic to the calculation of the energy loss in heavy quarkonium production in proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "we still view the process in a frame where a gluon from the proton splits into a heavy quark - antiquark pair , each of which has a mass @xmath165 , scattering on a nucleus .",
    "the transverse separation of the quark and antiquark is roughly @xmath61 and the transverse momentum of the ( anti)quark is much less than @xmath17 . here",
    "we shall focus on two different major models for the heavy quarkonium production : the color evaporation model @xcite and the color singlet model @xcite . in the color evaporation model",
    "the heavy quark - antiquark pair stays in a color octet state and is neutralized by some soft gluon emissions during the subsequent hadronization process .",
    "these gluons are different from the one that leads to the energy loss . in the color singlet model",
    "the transition from a octet state to a singlet state happens via the last inelastic scattering with the nucleus .",
    "this color transition mechanism has been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the color evaporation model comparing with the gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark jet production",
    ", one sees that the quark mass @xmath17 plays the role of a hard scale , which is the transverse momentum of the jets in the two - jet case .",
    "moreover , in the two - jet calculation we do not have to take the color transition into account , which is also the case for a quarkonium production in the evaporation model .",
    "therefore the calculation of heavy quarkonium production in the color evaporation model and two - jet calculation are very similar , so we shall focus on the evaporation model first and then study the color singlet model in detail in the next section .    in the color evaporation model ,",
    "almost all the calculations we have done for the gluon @xmath5 quark - antiquark jet production can be directly used for the heavy quarkonium production .",
    "the major difference is that now the phase space of the gluon radiation is more restricted . due to the heavy mass of the quark - antiquark pair",
    "the small - angle final state gluon radiation is forbidden .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath166 of a radiated gluon should be greater than @xmath167 , below which radiation is not possible .",
    "this suppression of small - angle radiation from a heavy mass object is known as the `` dead cone '' phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the allowed gluon radiation phase space of the heavy quark - antiquark pair coincides with that of the two - jet production when the gluon is emitted coherently from the two jets .",
    "that is the gluon radiation calculation in heavy quarkonium production is the same as the large - angle gluon radiation part in the two - jet case .",
    "furthermore , due to the suppression of small - angle gluon emission , we no longer have gluon radiation inside the opening angle between the quark and antiquark , i.e. the first term in [ eq : finalcom ] should not be included in the present calculation while the rest of the calculation follows exactly the same as the two - jet case .",
    "therefore , the gluon radiation spectrum is still given by [ eq : radspec , eq : radspecqs ] , with @xmath17 now interpreted as the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the phenomenology for this case has been carried out in refs .",
    "in the color singlet model the color octet quark - antiquark pair becomes a color singlet via either the last inelastic interaction , a mechanism that we will discuss in [ sec : singletno ] , or a gluon emission that carries a certain amount of energy from the system .",
    "however , the transition of the color state only happens once ; multiple transitions are suppressed in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "in contrast to the color evaporation model the following calculation can not be applied to proton - proton collisions , simply because in the color singlet model more than one gluon exchange is required to produce the heavy quarkonium .",
    "so in the following calculation we only calculate the @xmath1 production cross section with energy loss in proton - nucleus collisions without attempting to compare it with proton - proton collisions .",
    "another important aspect of the color singlet model calculation is that we shall take the @xmath1 production wave function into account .",
    "we will see later the @xmath1 wave function puts a quite strong constraint on the form of the @xmath22 matrix .",
    "the cross section reads @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the scattering factor , which will be replaced by , for example , [ eq : ssctt ] , of the quark - antiquark - gluon system propagating in the presence of a nucleus and @xmath170 is the @xmath1 production wave function which takes the following form @xcite : @xmath171mk_{1}(mx_{\\perp})\\partial_{x_{\\perp}}\\phi_{t}(x_{\\perp},z)\\big\\}\\ ] ] with @xmath172 and where @xmath173 , @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "note that the wave function [ eq : wavefunction ] contains modified bessel functions , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , which are even functions of @xmath60 .",
    "hence odd terms in either @xmath60 or @xmath177 can not survive in the calculation of @xmath169 . in the following calculation",
    "we will immediately neglect terms that are odd in @xmath60 or @xmath177 , which leads to great simplification .    moreover",
    ", we still classify the graphs in the same way as shown in [ fig : twojets ] .",
    "however , the reader should keep in mind that the quark - antiquark pair in [ fig : twojets ] should be in a color singlet in the final state in the following calculation , hence we put a superscript `` @xmath178 '' on the letter indicating the class .",
    "the color restriction , together with the property of the @xmath1 wave function , tremendously reduces the number of graphs we have to calculate .",
    "nevertheless the calculation of the last inelastic scattering , the @xmath179 integration [ see [ eq : singletsmatrix ] ] , becomes complicated for the initial - state - final - state interference terms .",
    "the allowed phase space of the gluon radiation is still the same as that in the color evaporation model .",
    "instead of going directly into the energy loss calculation we shall first review the color singlet model that has been discussed in ref .",
    "this is a good starting place to let the reader see the difference between the calculation in a color singlet model and that of the two - jet and heavy onium production in the color evaporation model .",
    "additional complexities come because we have to integrate over the places that the color transition happens , which makes the evaluation of the @xmath22 matrix completely different .",
    "so let us start with evaluating the @xmath22 matrix of a quark - antiquark propagating through a nucleus without energy loss while a color transition of the quark - antiquark pair happens during the scattering process .      .",
    "interactions before or after the last inelastic interaction are not shown.,width=491 ]    let us first calculate the @xmath22 matrix of a heavy quarkonium converting from a color octet state to a color singlet state while propagating through a nucleus as shown in [ fig : singlet ] @xcite . since we do not directly measure the quark - antiquark pair , we distinguish the transverse coordinates of the quark - antiquark pair in the amplitude and that in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "the quark - antiquark pair is converted to a color singlet state via the last inelastic scattering in the nucleus , which is indicated by a gluon line from a nucleon in [ fig : singlet ] .",
    "the inelastic scattering happening at a longitudinal coordinate @xmath179 brings in a scattering factor @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the length of the nuclear matter at an impact parameter @xmath182 . before the last inelastic scattering the quark - antiquark pair is in an octet state ,",
    "so elastic scatterings can occur off a single quark or antiquark in the amplitude or complex conjugate amplitude , or inelastic scatterings involving the quark ( antiquark ) in both the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "all these possible interactions are not drawn in [ fig : singlet ] .",

    "\\label{eq : sno}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we add one additional gluon to the above process , the calculation can become quite complicated , because the gluon radiation can also become another way of implementing the color transition .",
    "furthermore in the color singlet model we have to distinguish two different kinematic regions depending on the value of the saturation momentum : @xmath186 and @xmath187 with @xmath188 always the size of @xmath189 .",
    "thus we analyze these two different cases separately in the following .      in this region @xmath190 ,",
    "terms that are linear in @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath191 terms , vanish .",
    "we shall look for logarithmic terms like @xmath192 , which are roughly the size of @xmath193 .      with the restrictions that the quark - antiquark pair must be a color singlet and",
    "has even parity in the final state one can immediately see that the graphs in classes @xmath23 and @xmath25 , illustrated in [ fig : twojets ] , give no contribution .",
    "the only final state emission contribution comes from @xmath194\\cdot \\bigg[\\frac{z - x'/2}{(z - x'/2)^{2}}-\\frac{z+x'/2}{(z+x'/2)^{2}}\\bigg]s^{2}\\big((x'-x)/2\\big ) .",
    "\\label{eq : scthreet}\\ ] ] the @xmath195 integration in [ eq : scthreet ] is not logarithmic so that there is no logarithmic contribution from the purely final state radiation .",
    "again , graphs in classes @xmath23 and @xmath25 give no contribution .",
    "the nonzero contributions come from @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "for @xmath196 the color conversion can happen via an inelastic scattering in the nucleus .",
    "we have , for the @xmath198 contribution to @xmath169 in [ eq : cocs ] , @xmath199 where @xmath200 is given by [ eq : sno ] . since we are in the region where @xmath201 we can simply expand the exponents in @xmath200 and only keep the leading term that is even in @xmath60 and @xmath177 due to the parity of the @xmath1 wave function .",
    "that is @xmath202 becomes @xmath203 for @xmath197 the quark - antiquark pair remains in a color octet state after the gluon radiation and it is again the nucleus that converts the pair to a color singlet .",
    "otherwise if the gluon radiation converts the quark - antiquark pair to a singlet and then the pair scatters purely elastically off the nucleus , one can easily see that the quark - antiquark pair has odd parity in @xmath60 and @xmath177 .",

    "as we will see later the @xmath22 matrices describing the scattering for @xmath209 and @xmath210 are the same with the only difference between them being the gluon emission amplitude .",
    "now the evaluation of the @xmath22 matrix is slightly more complicated than what we have done in [ sec : singletf , sec : singleti ] , because in the previous calculation the way that the color transition happens is the same in both the amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude , either via a gluon radiation or the last inelastic scattering from the nucleus .",
    "however , here we have a mixture of the two ways of making the color conversion , i.e. if the quark - antiquark pair is converted to a color singlet via the last inelastic scattering in the nucleus in the amplitude ( complex conjugate amplitude ) then the gluon radiation must convert the octet state to a singlet state in the complex conjugate amplitude ( amplitude ) . in order to have a clear understanding of the calculation let us take one typical diagram from @xmath210 and study it in detail .",
    "furthermore , as we have mentioned before the only difference between @xmath211 and @xmath212 is the gluon emission part with the @xmath22 matrix being the same for all of them .",
    "thus let us focus on [ fig : singletrad ] and evaluate its @xmath22 matrix part first .     in the color singlet model.,width=453 ]    again , in [ fig : singletrad ] , the gluons from the circles , which now represent the nucleons , denote the longitudinal places , @xmath179 , where the last inelastic scatterings happen .",
    "the gluon line attached to the center of the quark - antiquark pair in the amplitude indicates that the gluon can be connected to either the quark or antiquark , while in the complex conjugate amplitude the gluon can only have one possible connection , as indicated in [ fig : singletrad ] .",
    "the other connection of the gluon line is suppressed in large @xmath0 .",
    "the scattering factor that the last inelastic scattering introduces then becomes @xmath213 which is different from [ eq : sfactor ] .",
    "note that now in the amplitude the color transition is made by the last inelastic scattering in the nucleus while in the complex conjugate amplitude the transition to a color singlet state is made by the gluon radiation .",
    "thus the inelastic scattering shown in the complex conjugate amplitude in [ fig : singletrad ] is not necessary for the process to occur and that interaction could be moved to the amplitude with the scattering occurring off the radiated gluon , which is not shown in [ fig : singletrad ] .",
    "this way of counting the `` inelastic scattering '' factor eventually gives @xmath214 instead of @xmath215 in [ eq : sfactor ] .",

    "\\label{eq : singletsmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first exponential in [ eq : singletsmatrix ] comes from the interactions before the last inelastic scattering .",
    "the quark - antiquark pair is in the color octet state and interactions can happen elastically and inelastically .",
    "the second exponential comes from the interactions after the last inelastic scattering . in the amplitude",
    "the quark - antiquark pair is already converted to a color singlet via the last inelastic scattering so further interactions on the quark - antiquark pair should be purely elastic , so only an @xmath39 term appears and no @xmath217 and @xmath218 terms . while , on the contrary , in the complex conjugate amplitude , the quark - antiquark is still in the color octet state and color conversion happens via the later gluon radiation .",
