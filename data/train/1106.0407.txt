    "the reduction of size in the electronic devices to nanometer scale has highlighted the importance of the effects of quantum coherence and interference .",
    "the control of such effects is important to provide both a better understanding of the quantum realm as well as new functionalities to the circuits @xcite .",
    "quantum interference allows to enhance or to cancel , total or partially , the response of the system beyond the simple classical additive behaviour .",
    "such an effect can pose a problem to be avoided but also could provide new capabilities to the device with respect to its classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "there is currently an increasing interest in being able to tune the parameters of mesoscopic systems , what would enable to manipulate their quantum behaviour for the advantageous design and applications of future electronic devices @xcite .",
    "the characteristic quantum phenomenon of the change of phase of the wave function along two paths enclosing a magnetic flux , i.e. the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite , has been envisioned for the feasible exploitation of the quantum phase in electronic devices @xcite .",
    "phase coherent effects in ab rings have been treated theoretically in the literature @xcite .",
    "closely related to the concept of coherence is the quantum interference between a discrete state with a continuum of states .",
    "this phenomenon was firstly studied by fano in the spectrum of photoionization of atoms and termed fano effect after him @xcite , but was found ubiquitous in a wide range of physical phenomena .",
    "interestingly , it has been observed in properly tailored nanoscale systems @xcite .",
    "the first tunable experiment showing the characteristic asymmetric fano profile in the electron transmission was reported in an ab ring with a quantum dot embedded in one of its arms @xcite .",
    "various parameters , such as the gate voltage and the magnetic flux through the ring among others , allowed to tune the peak and dip of the profile .",
    "more recently , a quantum dot molecule , i.e. two coupled quantum dots , has been embedded between the arms of an ab interferometer , with even a larger number of tunable parameters @xcite ; the transmission thus exhibits a large variety of behaviours as a function of them .",
    "in @xcite it is stated that the simplest fully coherent single - mode picture is of limited use for the interpretation of their experiments .",
    "in such a picture , the transmission is assumed to arise from a direct reflection and another one after travelling once around the ab ring .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to improve the theoretical description of the experimental results .",
    "+ here we present theoretical calculations of a model inspired in the system of ref .",
    "@xcite within a phase coherent non - interacting formalism .",
    "on one hand , we assessed the sensitivity of the conductance upon variation of the various model parameters . on the other hand , we show that the self - energy matrix elements , obtained from applying a partitioning technique to the hamiltonian , can give insight on the quantum interference and its dependence on the magnetic flux through the ring .",
    "this interpretation in terms of contributions through pathways , allows one to predict the onset or cancellation of the antiresonances as a function of the parameters of the model . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ model ] describes the model of the device and its connections to the leads .",

    "the transmission function represents the dimensionless conductance ( in units of the quantum @xmath19 ) and is calculated as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the matrix representation of the advanced and retarded green functions , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the spectral densities of the leads .",

    "interestingly , the self - energy @xmath52 becomes a sum of contributions throughout paths from above ( a ) , from below ( b ) and through the interarm coupling ( c ) .",

    "the transmission of the ring nearly coincides in almost the whole range with that of the lower arm , thus showing that the conduction is throughout such a pathway at almost every energy , except for @xmath139 .",

    "the transmission through the ring ( solid line ) still remains close to that of the lower arm with a lateral connection to site 2 .",
    "then , the overall picture for the transmission through a ring with different connection strengths along each arm , is that of the transmission throughout the stronger pathway ( i.e. , the one with larger hoppings ) at almost every energy , except at the one resonant with the energy of the site connecting the arms where a fano interference occurs .    in the presence of a magnetic flux , the self energy is a complex quantity and its modulus should be considered .",
    "( [ self - energy contributions 13 ] ) shows that the flux @xmath152 introduces a phase @xmath153 in the paths throughout the arms while no phase change occurs in the self - energy corresponding to the interarm coupling .",

    "it is clearly noted that even for @xmath116 there is an interference between the path contributions to the self - energy .",

    "a partitioning technique enables to decompose the transmission as a sum along interfering pathways .",

    "the experimentally observed change in the period of the aharonov - bohm phase from one to twice the quantum of flux is interpreted as due to the opening of one transmission pathway .",
    "our results suggest that a modified coherent single - mode picture including the electron reflection in the subrings forming the small orbits , could also be of help in interpreting the experiments .",
    "application of a magnetic flux leads to a suppression of the antiresonances due to the partial cancellation of the destructive quantum interference .",
    "we have also discussed the differences with a connection not realized experimentally in which one of the dots of the molecule is attached to one lead .",

    "<S> we study theoretically the transmission through a quantum dot molecule embedded in the arms of an aharonov - bohm four quantum dot ring threaded by a magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> the tunable molecular coupling provides a transmission pathway between the interferometer arms in addition to those along the arms . from a decomposition of the transmission in terms of contributions from paths </S>",
    "<S> , we show that antiresonances in the transmission arise from the interference of the self - energy along different paths and that application of a magnetic flux can produce the suppression of such antiresonances . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of a period of twice the quantum of flux arises to the opening of transmission pathway through the dot molecule . </S>",
    "<S> two different connections of the device to the leads are considered and their spectra of conductance are compared as a function of the tunable parameters of the model . </S>"
