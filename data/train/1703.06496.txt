    "two rules are followed : ( 1 ) only one output from the node @xmath18 should be considered when constructing a path and ( 2 ) multi - path condition should be checked in a node which has more than one input and one output .",
    "the multi - path condition occurs in a node when independent paths share part of a path while traversing the graph .",
