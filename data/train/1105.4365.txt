    "the measurement of density fluctuations and of the atomic compressibility was performed for non - interacting three - dimensional systems in harmonic traps  @xcite , while in the boson case , the connection between density fluctuations and compressibility was used to study superfluidity in a two - dimensional system , and extract critical exponents associated with the transition from a normal bose gas to a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless superfluid  @xcite .",
    "the experimental extraction of the isothermal compressibility from measurements of density fluctuations was suggested several years ago both in harmonically confined systems  @xcite and optical lattices  @xcite , but only recently improvements in the detection schemes of density fluctuations became sufficiently sensitive to extract this information from experimental data  @xcite .",

    "in fact , in a very recent experiment  @xcite using laser speckles , the isothermal compressibility and the spin susceptibility were measured as a function of interaction parameter via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem throughout the evolution from bcs to bec superfluidity in balanced fermi systems .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend some of our recent results  @xcite , and show that through local measurements of densities and density fluctuations several local and global thermodynamic properties can be extracted .",

    "spatially uniform systems , we show that the global compressibility can be extracted from measurements of the density and density fluctuations for each component , while for spatially non - uniform systems , we show that the local and global compressibility can be extracted from measurements of the local density and local density fluctuations for each component .",
    "finally , we also show that across the boundaries between different phases critical exponents can be extracted provided that there is sufficiently spatial resolution for the critical region to be experimentally accessed .",
