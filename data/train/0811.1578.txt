    "the phenomenological study of long gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) , on one hand , brings the possibility to use these extreme cosmic events as tracers of many astronomical and cosmological processes , and on the other , leads to a comprehensive description of the underlying grb physics ( see for recent reviews mszros 2006 ; ghirlanda , ghisellini & firmani 2006 ; zhang 2007 ) .",
    "the finding of correlations among spectral and energetic properties of the prompt emission has been the main avenue of progress in these directions .",
    "amati et al .",

    "the scatter around the ",
    "correlation suggests the existence of some hidden parameter(s ) .",

    "frame break ",
    "time in the afterglow light curve , ;  is tightly associated to .",
    "both parameters are time integrated quantities of the outflow in the fireball model . a correlation analogous to the ` amati ' one but for the peak isotropic  equivalent luminosity , , has been first reported by yonetoku et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . later on , for a sample of 19 grbs , firmani et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have found a strong correlation among ,   and a rest  frame prompt emission _",
    "high  signal _ grb time duration , .",
    "rossi et al . (",
    "2008 ) have also found a correlation among , , and , but with different slopes and scatter .",
    "more recently , collazzi & schaefer ( 2008 ) confirmed the firmani correlation , though the scatter they obtained for a larger sample is higher than in firmani et al .",
    "the homogeneity and the quality of the data seems to be crucial for obtaining reliable statistical results ; in this sense , the publicly available large database from the   is by now an invaluable source of data .",
    "the grb light curves are composed by a sequential superposition of many pulses , possibly originated by individual shock episodes .",
    "the spectral and temporal characteristics of these pulses are key ingredients for understanding the prompt emission mechanisms of grbs ( e.g. , ryde & petrosian 2002 ) .",
    "although there is not a simple pattern to describe the great variety of the light curve morphologies , some relations have been found in grbs with light curves characterized by a single pulse or a few well  separated pulses .",
    "for example , borgonovo & ryde ( 2001 ) have found a correlation between the ( bolometric or spectral peak ) energy flux , , and observed  during the decaying phase of individual , well  defined pulses : @xmath1 , with a mean @xmath2 .",
    "notice that  in this case is inferred from each time  resolved spectrum .",
    "further , liang , dai & xu ( 2004 ) have tested whether or not the relation @xmath3 within a burst holds in a sub  sample of 2408 time ",
    "resolved spectra for 91 bright -batse grbs presented by preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ; all kind of pulses are included in this sample ) .",
    "they reported that for 75% of the bursts , the spearman correlation coefficient is larger than 0.5 .",
    "nevertheless , even for the borgonovo & ryde sample of well  defined pulses , this correlation has a considerable scatter , which is probably produced by the superpositions of pulses .    if the individual pulses within a burst follow on average the correlation @xmath3 , then a natural question is _ whether there exists or not a universal relationship among all grbs in the rest frame .",
    "_    both the ` yonetoku ' and the   correlations ( firmani et al .",
    "2006 ) were established for grbs with known @xmath4 taken from heterogeneous samples , with incomplete available data , and by using hybrid quantities : the flux used to calculate  is at the peak of the light curve , while both  and the bolometric correction had to be inferred from the time  integrated spectrum . the primary data publicly available from the  satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) offers now the possibility to study the mentioned correlations in the rest  frame and with temporal resolution .",
    "unfortunately , the narrow spectral range of the  bat detector limits and makes difficult the spectral analysis .    by means of time ",
    "resolved spectral analysis for a sample of 32  and 7 bright  long grbs , we will show here that , when multiplying  by , the evolutionary tracks of different grbs form a well defined correlations , with a small scatter . in ",
    "2 we develop a heuristic framework to introduce such a connection .",
    "the grb samples used and the spectral analysis are presented in  3 . the construction of correlations with the prompt time  resolved data , the analysis of the selection effects , and a discussion of the results are presented in  4.1 . in  4.2 , we present our attempt to further reduce the scatter around the correlations by introducing the jet collimation correction .",
    "we show that most of the remaining scatter in the overall correlations is due to the individual scatter of each evolutionary track . in  5",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to study , in the rest frame , evolutionary features of the prompt @xmath5ray spectra and their connection with other grb properties . before discussing the data",
    ", we develop an heuristic reasoning aimed to show a potential connection between the phenomenological time  integrated and time  resolved correlations mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we start from the fact that the prompt evolution of a given burst can be characterised , at least above some flux and/or some peak energy limit , by the dependence @xmath6 , where  and  are defined at any given time . the power index @xmath7 as well as the scatter of the evolutionary correlation could change from burst to burst .",
    "previous analysis showed that the mean value of @xmath7 is around 2 with some dispersion ( borgonovo & ryde 2001 ; liang et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the rest frame ,",
    "the burst evolutionary track @xmath6 is equivalent to the correlation @xmath8 in the logarithmic plane   the evolutionary track described by eq .",
    "( [ lec ] ) identifies a straight strip with a slope @xmath7 , a zero point , and a specific sector on the strip .",
    "let us first assume @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath10 in this case is independent of the doppler  boosting factor @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the lorentz factor , the velocity , and the cosine of the viewing angle , respectively . by integrating in time",
    ", the evolutionary track reduces to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a rest  frame time scale of the energy emission .",
    "now , if observations give a correlation between  and @xmath17 among different grbs , ( the ` amati ' relation ) , then @xmath18 becomes approximately a constant independent of each grb .",
    "the conclusion is that scaling @xmath19 , the scatter of the correlation given by eq .",
    "( [ lec ] ) for a sample of grbs is less than the scatter around the ",
    "correlation for the same sample .",
    "the fact that @xmath20 for all the grbs simplifies the previous reasoning : since the evolutionary track given by eq .",
    "( [ lec ] ) and the ` amati ' relation show the same slope , then only the zero point of the strip is involved in the scatter around the ` amati ' relation .",
    "the parallel strips superimpose and thus reduce their occupation region on the plane .    if @xmath21 , the situation becomes more intriguing .",
    "now the evolutionary tracks are not aligned with the ` amati ' relation and so it is more difficult for them to reduce their occupation region on the   diagram .",
    "nevertheless , if not only the zero points of the strips , but even the occupation sectors of the evolutionary tracks within the strips _ conspire _ in order to agree with the ` amati ' relation , then a reduction of their occupation region on the plane ( reduction of the scatter ) may be reached .",
    "this inference allows to hope that @xmath16 plays a role of a hidden parameter related to the scatter of the correlation eq .",
    "( [ lec ] ) .",
    "this heuristic reasoning has actually inspired the present work .",
    "definitively , it is of great interest to verify with high quality prompt time  resolved data whether or not the ` firmani'like time  resolved relation @xmath22 vs @xmath23 is obeyed , and to study the scatter around it . if this relation is obeyed , then a corollary is that it establishes a link between the ` amati ' @xmath24 and the ` yonetoku ' @xmath25 relations and , even more importantly , a robust physical ingredient has to exist behind such relation in the sense that at each instant of the prompt the grb _ is aware _ of the duration of the entire process .    before presenting results from our spectral analysis on  and  grbs with known redshift",
    ", we explore the large set of time  resolved spectra from the  data analysed by kaneko et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . since for the great majority of the bursts in this sample",
    "the redshift is unknown , we are able to infer only the values of the slope @xmath7 of the individual correlations @xmath26",
    ". the slope should remain the same for the corresponding individual rest ",
    "frame correlations @xmath27 vs @xmath22 .",
    "the kaneko et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample contains 350 bright grbs and 7427 time  resolved spectra .",
    "each time  resolved spectrum was fitted to a band ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) function .",
    "we consider only time  resolved spectra with band model parameters @xmath28 ; @xmath29 and 50@xmath30@xmath301800 kev ( note that  is in the observer frame ) with an uncertainty better than 50% and a time step shorter than 4 s. we assume a bolometric correction given by the band energy distribution .",
    "finally , we take into account only grbs with at least 5 time ",
    "resolved spectra .",
    "such conditions reduce the sample to 208 grbs .    for this sample ,",
    "only 16% of the grb tracks show a disagreement with @xmath20 , while the other 84% are compatibles with @xmath20 at the @xmath31 level .",
    "a similar result , but for less events than here , has been reported by liang et al .",
    "( 2004 ; see their figure 2 for the @xmath32 tracks corresponding to some bursts ) .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fgamm ] the maximum bolometric flux , @xmath33 , of a given event versus @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is used in order the error bars ( at 3@xmath36 ) looked symmetric .",
    "it is clearly seen that only a small fraction of the events ( thick black error bars ) have values of @xmath7 different from 2 within @xmath37 ( vertical dashed line shows @xmath38 degrees ) ; the majority of them ( thin red error bars ) show @xmath7 compatible with 2 within the @xmath37 level . in fig .",
    "[ fgamm ] it is also seen that the correlation slope @xmath7 is not biased systematically by @xmath33 , though its uncertainty and the spread around 2 increse as @xmath33 decreases .",
    "the result shown above opens the question of identifying the physical mechanisms that determine the value of @xmath7 as well as the intrinsic scatter of each evolutionary track .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of grbs shows @xmath39 , @xmath40 supports the consistency of our research concerning a universal correlation , @xmath41 provides a natural grb identification criterion to eventually optimise such correlation , and @xmath42 allows to study the behaviour of those grbs with @xmath21 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     taking into account the result by firmani et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , our next step is to explore a possible correlation of  and  with the high  signal emission rest frame time . for calculating ,",
    "we have taken into account the corrections due to the cosmological time dilation and the narrowing of the light curve s temporal substructure at higher energies ( fenimore et al .",
    "1995 ) . following reichart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , this last correction on , calculated fixing the energy band on the rest frame , goes as @xmath43 with @xmath44 . then applying both corrections we obtain @xmath45 actually the value of @xmath46 is not well constrained . for a large batse database , zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath46 ( modeled as gaussian ) is @xmath47 with a median value of @xmath48 ; the distribution is skewed to smaller values .",
    "for the  sample we find that  roughly tends to be @xmath49 with a large scatter , while  does not show any significant correlation with . now ,",
    "if we plot @xmath50 from each time  resolved spectrum vs @xmath51 , then the scatter reduces for @xmath52 and a clear trend with slope @xmath53 ( upper dashed line ) is observed ( panel ( a ) of fig .",

    "this result implies that the residuals in the   diagram ( fig .",
    "[ lesb ] ) correlates with .",
    "it is interesting to show in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ levst ] the position of some short grbs with known redshift .",
    "we have carried out time resolved spectral analysis for @xmath54  short grbs . as seen in fig .",
    "[ levst ] , these data are naturally segregated in the diagram , having significantly smaller @xmath55 values than those of the long grbs .    with the aim of checking for possible selection effects behind the correlation presented in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ levst ] , we plot the data with the color code representing the observed peak photon flux ( ) range , and with the cross size indicating the redshift range . our first test has to do with the influence of  on the @xmath55 vs @xmath51 diagram .",

    "[ levst ] , the correlation is remarkably insensitive to the peak flux . in other words",
    "the sensitivity limit does not influence the correlation ; it only limits the number of objects on it .",
    "our second test refers to a possible bias with @xmath4 . according to the same panel of fig .",
    "[ levst ] , it is evident that the data plotted in the @xmath59 diagram are not appreciably biased by @xmath4 . a third test concerns a possible selection effect on the grb duration . by plotting @xmath60 vs @xmath51 for all the  grbs with known @xmath4 ( even those with @xmath61 , which were not used in our analysis here )",
    ", we have seen that the limit @xmath62 is well above any biasing limit for .    finally , while the upper right side of the diagram in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ levst ] involves fluxes that are not biased by selection effects , the presence of short grbs on the bottom left side of the same diagram gives a further evidence against any selection effect here .",
    "unfortunately any further exhaustive analysis on the distribution of  is impossible due to the limited bat spectral capability .",
    "we conclude that the correlation @xmath59 vs @xmath51 is reasonably free from selection effects .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ levst ] shows for the  sample how much the residuals of the    diagram of fig .",

    "the best fit slope of the @xmath63 vs @xmath51 correlation is @xmath64 . combining this result with the ",
    "best fit slope we obtain that the correlation @xmath22 vs @xmath65 reaches its minimum scatter for @xmath66 . a similar analysis on the  sample leads to @xmath67 . given the relevance of this result we have made use of other more sofisticated methods based on multilinear analysis obtaining in each case @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "this result implies that the emission time @xmath51 of the events on the diagram of fig .",
    "[ lesb ] increases along the orthogonal direction of the best fit straight line when one goes from the low  ",
    "high  to the high  low .",
    "therefore , as it has been found in firmani et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for a different sample ,   reduces the scatter around the correlation @xmath22 vs @xmath27 . later on we will estimate the reduction of such scatter .",
    "this result is particularly intriguing because it reveals how instantaneous features such as  and  are actually regulated according to the overall duration of the burst .",

    "the best fit line , as in fig . [ lesb ] , refers only to the   sample , and the corresponding scatter is represented by the dot  dashed lines .",
    "our basic considerations will not change appreciably assuming @xmath72 even for the   sample .",

    "this is rather evident if we imagine that the effect of  is to shift the borders of the @xmath22 vs @xmath27 correlation into the body of the @xmath22 vs @xmath65 correlation .",
    "then the lack of low luminosity events influences now the population of the @xmath22 vs @xmath65 correlation and not its borders .",
    "following ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , a way to reduce the scatter around the @xmath22 vs @xmath65 correlation could be by correcting the time ",
    "resolved isotropic luminosities by the jet collimation angle in order to estimate the intrinsic @xmath5ray temporal luminosities , @xmath81 .",
    "the collimation semi  aperture angle  is calculated from the jet break time and the total emitted isotropic energy  by two alternative models : the homogeneous ism model ( hm ) and the wind medium model ( wm ) .",

    "the jet opening angle is given by : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the radiative efficiency that we assume equal to 0.2 , and @xmath84 is the medium density that we assume equal to 3 @xmath85 .",
    "figure [ ltcesb ] shows the collimation  corrected correlation @xmath22 vs. @xmath86 for 12 grb with known  ( left correlation ) , together with the same data presented in fig .",
    "[ ltesb ] ( right correlation ) .",
    "the best fit line showed for the collimation  corrected correlation refers only to the  sample ; the corresponding scatter is represented by the dot  dashed lines .",
    "fitting the data with the line @xmath87 the best fit parameters of the @xmath22 vs @xmath86 correlations ( hm case ) for  and  samples are given in tables 3 and 4 , respectively ( relation lthe ) .",
    "the slopes of both correlations are very close , the average being @xmath88 .",
    "concerning the scatter , for both samples  has clearly reduced its value with respect to the one in the @xmath22 vs @xmath89 correlations ; on average we find @xmath90 .",
    "we conclude that the hm collimation angle introduces a remarkable reduction on the scatter in the @xmath22 vs @xmath89 correlation .",
    "however , such a reduction does not concern the internal scatter in each grb evolutionary track .    in order to estimate the contribution of the internal scatter from each evolutionary track to the overall correlation intrinsic scatter ,",
    "we have performed the following exercise . for each sample (   or ) , every ",
    "grb track is shifted rigidly to best fit with the collimation ",
    "corrected correlation @xmath22 vs @xmath86 presented above for the corresponding sample ( see fig .",
    "[ lttesb ] for the  sample ; here the evolutionary tracks of the   grbs are included only for graphic display ) .",
    "we are now able to calculate the new intrinsic scatter of the corresponding sample , , around the respective correlation @xmath22 vs @xmath86 .",
    "the values of  ( relation lthe ) are reported in tables 3 and 4 for the  and   samples , respectively . by comparing  and ,",
    "it is rather evident that the scatter of the tight collimation ",
    "corrected correlation is dominated by the internal scatter of the evolutionary tracks .",
    "a similar result is obtained if instead of the entire sample we estimate the  taking into account the grb with the known jet break time alone .",
    "in fact in this case the average internal scatter is @xmath91 .",
    "we conclude that any further reduction of the collimation ",
    "corrected correlation scatter could be reached by reducing the internal scatter of each evolutionary track , and that the latter should be possibly identifying the hidden parameters behind the stochastic properties of the evolutionary tracks of each grb .    in the wm model",
    "the jet opening angle is given by @xmath92 where now the medium density is supposed to be @xmath93 g @xmath94 and we assume @xmath95 .",
    "tables 3 and 4 present the corresponding best fit parameters for the @xmath22 vs @xmath96  correlation in the wm case ( relation ltwe ) . in this case",
    "the best fit slopes are moderately close ( @xmath97 cl ) .",
    "the average of both slopes is @xmath98 .",
    "the scatters  of the wm collimation  corrected correlations are also smaller than the ones of the not corrected correlations @xmath22 vs @xmath99 , but the scatter reduction is smaller than in the hm case . on average we find @xmath100 . after performing the same _ track shifting _ procedure described above , we find that also in this case the internal scatter of each grb evolutionary track provides the dominant component of the scatter around the tight @xmath22 vs @xmath101 correlation .    finally , we have explored whether the residuals of the    correlation correlate or not with several prompt light  curve parameters : the variability @xmath102 ( reichart et al . 2001 ) ; the `` emission symmetry '' @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the duration times of the fluence ",
    "halves , from @xmath106 and @xmath107 of the total counts , respectively ( borgonovo & bjrnsson 2006 ) ; the @xmath108 ratio , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the peak energies of the integrated @xmath111 spectra for each of the two time intervals @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively ( borgonovo & bjrnsson 2006 ) .",
    "our preliminary results show that the residuals are not correlated with any of these parameters , i.e. none of them could be a potential reductor of the scatter around the    correlation .",
    "we have selected the high  signal time  resolved spectra from the available sample of  long grbs with measured @xmath4 , and analysed them with the aim to search for systematic features of the local @xmath5ray emission mechanism and their connection with known global grb properties . requiring a grb peak flux @xmath0 , a total of 207 time  resolved spectra corresponding to 32 grbs ( until february 2008 ) were analysed .",
    "we have included also 287 spectra from 7 bright  grbs with @xmath4 known analysed previously in kaneko et al .",
    "since the two samples are affected in a different way by some systematic effects , we preferred to perform our correlation analysis separately for each sample and then to check whether the results are consistent or not between them .",
    "we have found that they are indeed consistent .",
    "thus , for simplicity , in what follows we report the averages of the two samples for the best  fit parameters of the different correlations .",
    "the main results and conclusions from our study are as follows :    * by plotting the time  resolved data  points in the logarithmic ",
    "diagram , a linear band with average slope @xmath112 and intrinsic scatter @xmath113 appears . while the low  ",
    "high  region is free of selection effects , the high  low   region could be affected by the flux limits of the samples .",
    "* we found that the residuals in the ",
    "diagram correlate with .",
    "this result offers a strong evidence that the parameter  reduces the scatter of the @xmath22 vs @xmath27 correlation . by analyzing the  vs @xmath59 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ levst ] ) , we have checked that selection effects are not responsible for such a trend . * in agreement with the previous point , we have introduced the logarithmic diagram @xmath22 vs @xmath65 and have found that the optimal value @xmath114 reduces the scatter to @xmath115 .",
    "the average slope of the correlation is @xmath73 .",
    "such correlation reveals three important aspects .",
    "first , its intrinsic scatter is smaller than the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath22 vs @xmath27 correlation .",
    "second , it is reasonably free from selection effects , accordying to our our analysis in the  vs @xmath59 diagram .",
    "third , it represents a connection between instantaneous features ( , ) and global features ( ) .",
    "_ at any moment , the instantaneous features of a grb correlate with the entire prompt duration as if at each instant of the prompt the grb _ would be aware _ of the duration of the entire process_. * for the 12 grbs out of our samples ( 7 from the  and 5 from the  samples , respectively ) for which the jet break time  is known , we could further reduce the scatter of each sample by using the collimation  corrected luminosity  by estimating the collimation jet angle for the homogeneous ( hm ) and wind medium ( wm ) cases .",
    "the lowest intrinsic scatter has been obtained for the @xmath22 vs @xmath86 correlation in the hm case ; the ( average ) slope of the correlation is @xmath88 and @xmath90 .",
    "* we have estimated the contribution of the internal scatter of the evolutionary tracks to the scatter of the overall correlations .",
    "for this , the evolutionary track of each grb has been shifted to best fit with the corresponding collimation  corrected ( hm and wm cases ) correlations .",
    "our results indicate that for both cases @xmath116 , this means that the total intrinsic scatter is mainly due to the internal scatter of the tracks .",
    "thus , with the caveat that the statistics is still limited , we conclude that _ any further reduction of the scatter around the grb empirical correlations may be attained by discovering the hidden variables behind the stochastic features of the individual liso  evolutionary tracks_.    we conclude that the long grb individual evolutionary tracks populate a rather narrow strip in the @xmath22 vs @xmath89 diagram with a slope @xmath117 , whatever the evolutionary track slope is .",
    "the jet collimation correction further reduces the thickness of such strip and leads the slope close to @xmath118 .",
    "while selection effects probably are present in the @xmath22 vs @xmath27 diagram , they do not seem to weaken our conclusion .",
    "this implies the existence of a universal @xmath7ray emission mechanism for long grbs where the instantaneous features are modulated by a global parameter , which we found here to be .",
    "we suggest that the interconnection between  and the ",
    "evolutionary tracks is at the basis of the global ` amati ' and ` ghirlanda ' relations .",
