    "it was realized early in the development of theoretical nuclear structure models @xcite that the @xmath1n nucleus is an ideal candidate for study because considerable experimental work had shown that there existed seven positive parity states that might be described as a closed 1p shell with a single 2s or 1d shell particle outside its core .",
    "in addition , the large energy gap between the ground and first excited state , 5.3 mev , similar to the 6 mev gap in @xmath10o , reinforced the idea of @xmath1n having a closed core for its ground state .",
    "it was also pointed out in halbert and french @xcite , one of the first shell model calculations describing the low lying positive parity states , that many levels in @xmath1n could be populated by a large variety of inelastic and particle transfer reactions making this nucleus ideal for testing details of future model calculations .",
    "later , weak coupling model calculations @xcite focused on the positive parity states with the goal of extending the understanding of these states up to 10 mev in excitation . while the first works included only 1p-2h configurations it was argued by shukla and brown @xcite that contributions from 3p-4h states were needed to describe several of the levels below 10 mev and the work of lie _",
    "_ @xcite confirmed this idea .",
    "@xcite also proposed that spin parity assignments could be made by comparing theoretical calculations with the measured properties of levels and in further work lie and engeland @xcite extended calculations for both positive and negative parity levels up to 13 mev in excitation .",
    "an excellent test for these extended calculations was their comparison with the three particle transfer reactions @xmath11c(@xmath12li,@xmath13 ) @xcite and @xmath11c(@xmath14li,@xmath15he ) @xcite where both reactions selectively populate states including an especially strongly populated one at 10.69 mev with much more strength than would be consistent with the known @xmath16 level .",
    "the large angular momentum mismatch of the ( @xmath14li,@xmath15he ) reaction favored the population of a high spin state , which was then matched to a @xmath17 state calculated by lie and engeland @xcite close to this excitation energy and having a large 3p-4h component .",
    "concurrently , a @xmath0c(p,@xmath18 ) study discovered a new resonance at 10.693 mev in excitation and gave it a @xmath17 assignment , and its decay reported in ref .",
    "@xcite was subsequently used to demonstrate that three particle transfer reactions @xcite do indeed strongly populate this 3p-4h , @xmath17 state as predicted by theory .    this work reports new data for the @xmath0n(d , p ) reaction taken at a bombarding energy of 16 mev to locate all narrow neutron single particle states up to 15 mev in excitation .",
    "it continues the ideas of the early shell model theoretical studies with the goal of testing a modern calculation against the known level structure of @xmath1n and then to use this calculation along with the new @xmath0n(d , p ) data to identify all single particle levels up to 12 mev in excitation .",
    "these firm spin parity assignments are then used to determine their mirror levels in the lesser known nucleus @xmath1o @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the present single neutron data and that from a recently published @xmath0n(@xmath15he , d ) proton transfer study @xcite are combined to determine the 2s@xmath2 and 1d@xmath3 centroid energies in the @xmath1n@xmath4o mirror pair . with these results , a reasonable estimate is made for the concentration of the 1d@xmath9 strength in these nuclei .",
    "the single particle centroid energies of the mass 15 nuclei are particularly interesting because they are in the cross over region where the 2s@xmath2 orbit lies below the 1d@xmath3 orbit in @xmath19c , and above it in @xmath20o .",
    "an analysis of an early extensive @xmath0n(d , p ) study @xcite showed these orbits to be almost degenerate in @xmath1n .",
    "however , the published spectrum showed possible single particle states for which no analysis of spectroscopic strength was carried out , suggesting the possibility that some strength for these orbits might lie at a higher excitation energy than studied to date .",
    "the present higher energy ( d , p ) work was designed to search for this possible missing strength .",
    "the extraction of these centroid energies adds to our knowledge of the evolution of the s - d shell orbits as a function of proton and neutron number , the importance of which has been detailed in a recent publication of hoffman _",
    "cross sections for the @xmath0n(d , p)@xmath1n reaction were obtained by bombarding a melamine ( c@xmath21h@xmath22n@xmath22 ) target of about 300  @xmath23 on a 20  @xmath23 carbon backing with a 16 mev deuteron beam produced by the fsu tandem - linac accelerator combination .",
    "data were also collected on a carbon target at the same angles as for the melamine to separate its contribution to the higher excitation @xmath1n spectra from the melamine , the main experimental thrust of the current work .",
    "a @xmath24e - e silicon detector telescope was used to measure the outgoing protons and deuterons and a single silicon detector on the opposite side of the incoming beam served as a monitor of the target conditions .",
    "the deuteron beam current was limited to 15  na to make certain that there was no loss of target due to beam heating during the data collection .",
    "elastic scattering and transfer data were also taken at deuteron beam energies of 9 , 10 , and 12 mev to extract absolute cross sections and to check these cross sections with previously published ( d , p ) data @xcite . to make use of previously published @xmath11c and @xmath0n deuteron elastic scattering data to establish the absolute cross section for the ( d , p ) reaction , it was necessary to adopt a procedure to separate the two peak yields since the elastic peak contained yield from both nuclei , most notably at forward angles . to extract the carbon yield from the total peak , the ratio of the yield for the 4.4 mev first excited state in @xmath11c to that for the @xmath11c ground state for the deuteron scattering by the carbon target",
    "was found at all measured angles .",
    "the elastic nitrogen yield was determined by extracting the 4.4 mev yield from the melamine target and then using the yield ratio from the carbon target to subtract its contribution to the total nitrogen plus carbon elastic yield . for the angles 25@xmath25 , 30@xmath25 and 35@xmath25 it was possible to separate the yields from carbon and nitrogen which provided a direct check on the ratio technique .",
    "the relative elastic scattering angular distributions for both carbon and nitrogen were normalized to optical model calculations based on previously published elastic scattering data @xcite for both nuclei to extract a normalization constant that establishes the absolute cross section for the ( d , p ) transfer reactions the error in the absolute cross sections in ref .",
    "@xcite is 15% which is taken as the absolute error here .    a typical @xmath0n(d , p ) spectrum showing the population of @xmath1n states up to 15 mev in excitation is displayed in figure [ figure:15n - spectra ] .",
    "also shown are the energies for the various particle decay thresholds for @xmath1n .",
    "note also in the spectrum the contribution from the @xmath11c(d , p ) peaks and the strong peak arising from the hydrogen in the target .",
    "figure [ figure:15n - spectra ] also shows the @xmath11c(d , p ) spectrum below that from the melamine demonstrating that the narrow peaks above 10 mev are indeed from the @xmath0n(d , p ) reaction .",
    "all the narrow peaks below 11.5 mev in excitation reported earlier in phillips and jacobs @xcite were observed in the present work including the narrow peaks at 10.066 and 11.236 mev , whereas those at 12.145 and 12.493 mev were not .",
    "the 11.236 mev angular distribution was not included in the analysis of ref .",
    "it was not possible to extract an angular distribution for the small peak in the spectrum at 10.80 mev in excitation because of its weak population and its being obscured at many angles by the nearby peak from the hydrogen in the target .",
    "in contrast with various multiparticle transfer reactions that selectively populate narrow peaks up to 20 mev in excitation in @xmath1n , no strong isolated peaks are observed in the @xmath0n(d , p ) spectrum above 12.5 mev in excitation . while there appears to be a broad peak around 14.5 mev in excitation , it was not possible to prove conclusively that it was not from the known broad @xmath26 state at 8.2 mev in @xmath19c @xcite .",
    "data were taken in the laboratory angular range from 10@xmath25 to 35@xmath25 in 5@xmath25 steps to produce angular distributions for extracting the orbital angular momentum transfer and the single particle spectroscopic factors that provide a measure of the neutron single particle strength for a given state .",
    "the size of the relative errors in the angular distribution data are either smaller or equal to the size of the data points or are shown .",
    "the present work reports the results of new @xmath1n shell model calculations that used an unrestricted 1p-2s1d shell valence space with an interaction hamiltonian taken from the work of utsuno and chiba @xcite .",
    "time dependent and traditional shell model procedures were used with the computer code cosmo @xcite to perform the calculations .",
    "the known and calculated states in @xmath1n are given in the first two columns of table [ table:15n-15o ] , where it can be seen that all known levels can be paired with calculated ones .",
    "the number in parenthesis besides that for a given spin and parity refers to the theoretical level ordering so that for example @xmath27 is the third @xmath28 level and its known partner is found at 9.155 mev .",
    "figure [ figure : theorydist ] displays the difference between the known and calculated levels .",
    "the energies of the calculated positive parity states are fairly well predicted by the calculations , but the energies of the negative parity states are higher than their corresponding experimental ones .",

    "the present mirror level would assign @xmath16 to the second 8.922 mev level with its mirror being the 9.152 mev @xmath16 level in @xmath1n .",
    "the @xmath1o level listed at 9.484 @xmath92 has no known mirror in @xmath1n and is probably the same as the 9.488 @xmath46 level with its @xmath1n mirror being at 9.76 mev . while the current compilation has the spin - parity assignments for the @xmath1o levels at 8.98 , 9.829 , 10.066 , 10.29 , 10.461 , 10.48 and 10.506 in brackets , ( see table [ table:15n - o - old ] ) , mirror levels in @xmath1n all have firm assignments which then allows these brackets to be removed .",
    "in addition , the 9.66 mev level in @xmath1o is assigned as @xmath48 based on its mirror 9.829 in @xmath1n .",
    "the present @xmath0n(d , p ) study along with the shell model calculations presented earlier assign @xmath37 to the 11.236 mev @xmath1n level .",
    "its mirror at 10.917 in @xmath1o has a firm assignment of @xmath37 supporting this assignment .",
    "table [ table:15n-15o ] gives the final level assignments in the mirrors @xmath1n@xmath4o from the present work .",
    "from the present work and a recent detailed study of the @xmath0n(@xmath15he , d ) reaction @xcite it is possible to extract the single particle centroid energies for the 2s@xmath2 and 1d@xmath3 single particle orbits in the @xmath1n@xmath4o pair .",
    "the single particle strengths for the two reactions are similar in terms of which states have the major single particle components but the absolute values for the ( @xmath15he , d ) reaction are on average only 65% of those extracted from the ( d , p ) analysis . because @xmath0n has a ground state spin of 1 , the determination of the energy weighted single particle energies ( ewspe ) is slightly modified when compared to its determination from spin 0 targets and equation 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite is used to determine the values in the present work .",
    "the present @xmath0n(d , p ) work showed there to be single neutron strength at higher excitation energies that would shift the centroid energies higher from those computed based on previous lower energy work .",
    "in addition the ( @xmath15he , d ) work limited its study to lower lying levels so that it is necessary to estimate where high lying single particle strength might be found in @xmath1o if a meaningful comparison between the two nuclei is to be made .",
    "data for the @xmath1o single particle strengths were inferred from their @xmath1n mirror for `` transitions '' to @xmath1o levels at 8.284 @xmath77 , 9.484 @xmath92 and 10.917 @xmath93 mev .",
    "the spectroscopic factors for these `` transitions '' were generated from those for the @xmath1n mirror states by multiplying them by 0.6 , the factor by which the @xmath1o spectroscopic factors are reduced relative to the @xmath1n ones .",
    "the energy weighted sum rule for the 1d@xmath3 orbit in @xmath1n is then 7.97 mev while that for @xmath1o is 7.47 mev .",
    "the 2s@xmath2 sum rule is then 8.08 mev in @xmath1n and 7.43 mev in @xmath1o .",
    "these results show that the 1d@xmath3 and 2s@xmath2 orbits in these mass 15 mirrors are essentially degenerate .",
    "if one uses just the main spectroscopic factors reported by bertone _",
    "@xcite , then the @xmath1o 1d@xmath3 centroid is at 6.98 mev and that for 2s@xmath2 is 7.11 mev and using only their mirror levels in @xmath1n , the 1d@xmath3 centroid lies at 7.26 mev and that for 2s@xmath2 is at 7.64 mev .",
    "the higher lying single particle strengths , while weak , do raise the single particle centroid energies by about 0.5 mev .",
    "based on the location of the 1d@xmath9 orbit in @xmath20o , it is expected that its single particle strength in the mass 15 system will lie 5 mev or so above the 1d@xmath3 orbit and so would be centered around 13 mev in excitation , where a simple calculation shows its width to be about 1 mev , thus confirming the strength calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:15n_sf - theory ] .",
    "an interesting test of the current shell model calculation occurs with the prediction of the existence of a @xmath48 level located at 11.54 mev in @xmath1n .",
    "while the current compilation for @xmath1n does not show such a level , a search of the literature reveals just such a level found in a @xmath94b  +  @xmath13 resonance study by wang _",
    ". _ @xcite .",
    "current level listings for @xmath1n show only the presence of a @xmath32 level with a width of 41 kev located at 11.438 mev whereas the data in ref .",
    "@xcite show both the presence of this level and a very narrow level ( @xmath95 kev ) which they assign as @xmath48 .",
    "further support for this @xmath48 assignment is found in the @xmath94b(@xmath12li , t ) and @xmath94b(@xmath14li , d ) work of norton _",
    "@xcite which populates a peak at 11.44 mev .",
    "unfortunately the experimental energy resolution of the alpha transfer work ( @xmath91100 kev ) does not allow the extraction of experimental widths which would determine whether both the @xmath32 and @xmath48 levels are populated or only one of the pair at 11.44 mev .",
    "however , because there is a one to one correspondence between the calculated and experimental levels up to @xmath9112 mev in @xmath1n it is likely that the new @xmath48 level should be added to the level structure of @xmath1n .",
    "the present work reports new @xmath0n(d , p ) data that find no narrow single neutron states occurring above about 12.5 mev in excitation in contrast with multi - particle transfer reactions that populate a rich spectrum of states up to at least 20 mev in excitation in @xmath1n .",
    "shell model calculations that employ a cross shell 1p@xmath762s1d interaction are able to reproduce and confirm the known @xmath1n positive and negative parity level scheme up to 11.5 mev in excitation and are used to assign the spin - parity to a single particle level at 11.236 mev in @xmath1n as well as to confirm the presence of a narrow level at 11.436 mev of an alpha particle cluster nature .",
    "knowledge of the spin - parities of the @xmath1n levels is then used to provide a complete set of spin - parities for its less well known mirror , @xmath1o , up to 11 mev in excitation .",
    "figure 7 displays the calculated and final level schemes for these nuclei .",
    "the 2s@xmath2 and 1d@xmath3 single particle centroid neutron and proton energies show these orbits to be degenerate in the mass 15 system which means that these are the nuclei where the level ordering shifts between the lighter systems where the 2s@xmath2 orbit lies below that of the 1d@xmath3 orbit and the heavier system where the 1d@xmath3 orbit lies below that of the 2s@xmath2 orbit .",
