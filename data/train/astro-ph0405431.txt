    "the two fundamental quantities in explosive phenomena are the kinetic energy , @xmath12 , and the mass of the explosion ejecta , @xmath13 , or equivalently the expansion velocity , @xmath14 , or lorentz factor , @xmath15 .",
    "together , these gross parameters determine the appearance and evolution of the resulting explosion .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are distinguished by a highly relativistic initial velocity , @xmath16 , as inferred from their nonthermal prompt emission @xcite . for the range of @xmath0-ray isotropic - equivalent energies observed in grbs , @xmath17 erg @xcite ,",
    "this indicates @xmath18 m@xmath19 , compared to several m@xmath19 in supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the true energy release of grbs depends sensitively on the geometry of the explosion . for a collimated outflow ( `` jet '' ) with a half - opening angle @xmath20 ,",
    "it is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 $ ] is the beaming fraction ; the true ejecta mass is also a factor of @xmath23 lower . over the past",
    "several years there has been growing evidence for such collimated outflows coming mainly from achromatic breaks in the afterglow light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the epoch at which the break occurs , @xmath24 , corresponds to the time at which the ejecta bulk lorentz factor decreases below @xmath25 @xcite .    in this context",
    ", several studies have shown that the beaming - corrected energies of most grbs , in both the prompt @xmath0-rays and afterglow phase , are of the order of @xmath26 erg @xcite .",
    "the various analyses are sensitive to the energy contained in ejecta with different velocities , @xmath27 in the @xmath0-rays , @xmath28 in the early x - rays , and @xmath29 in the broad - band afterglow . however , _",
    "none _ are capable of tracing the existence and energy of non - relativistic ejecta .",
    "@xcite overcame this problem in the case of grb970508 by modeling the afterglow radio emission in the non - relativistic phase , thus inferring @xmath30 erg .",
    "this analysis has two significant advantages .",
    "first and foremost it is independent of jet collimation since the blastwave approaches spherical symmetry on the same timescale that it becomes non - relativistic @xcite .",
    "second , this analysis relies on the simple and well - understood sedov - taylor dynamics of spherical blastwaves , as opposed to the hydrodynamics of spreading relativistic jets .",
    "in addition , the peak of the synchrotron spectrum on the relevant timescale lies in the radio band where the afterglow is observable for several hundred days .",
    "two recent developments make similar analyses crucial .",
    "we now recognize that some grbs are dominated by mildly relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "for example , for grb030329 the kinetic energy inferred from the afterglow emission , @xmath31 erg @xcite , was an order of magnitude higher than the @xmath0-ray energy release @xcite .",
    "similarly , for grb980425 @xmath32 erg @xcite was about @xmath33 of the relativistic kinetic energy of the associated sn1998bw , @xmath34 erg @xcite .",
    "this begs the question , is there even more energy emerging from the engine , either at the time of the burst or later on , at non - relativistic velocities ?",
    "second , there is a growing interest in `` unification models '' for grbs , x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) and core - collapse sne of type ib / c , relying primarily on energetics arguments .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that grbs and xrfs share an energy scale of @xmath35 erg , and that all type ib / c sne give rise to grbs or xrfs .",
    "both conclusions result from significantly smaller values of @xmath20 compared to those inferred in the past , such that the energy scale , @xmath36 , is lower by a factor of @xmath37 and the true grb rate , @xmath38 , matches locally the type ib / c sn rate . given the important ramifications of the grb energy scale for progenitor scenarios we would like to independently address the question : is the energy scale of cosmic explosions @xmath39 erg , implicating all type ib / c sne in the production of grbs , or does it cluster on @xmath40 erg ?",
    "the answer will also provide an independent confirmation of the jet paradigm by comparison to the isotropic - equivalent energies .",
    "this is crucial since other explanations for the light curve breaks have been suggested , including changes in the density of the circumburst medium , a transition to a non - relativistic evolution on the timescale of a few days ( due to a high circumburst density ) , and changes in the energy spectrum of the radiating electrons @xcite .",
    "here we address the possibility of significant contribution from non - relativistic ejecta and robustly determine the energy scale of grbs independent of geometrical assumptions , using very large array radio observations of the afterglows of grbs 970508 and 980703 in the non - relativistic phase .",
    "we generally follow the treatment of @xcite , but unlike these authors we carry out a full least - squares fit to the data .",
    "the dynamical evolution of an ultra - relativistic blastwave expanding in a uniform medium ( hereafter , ) is described in terms of its lorentz factor , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the radius of the blastwave and @xmath43 is the number density of the circumburst medium @xcite .",
    "this , along with the relation for the observer time , which for the line of sight to the center of the blastwave is @xmath44 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , determines the evolution of the radius and lorentz factor . for",
    "a spherical blastwave the expansion will eventually become non - relativistic on a timescale , @xmath45 d , determined by the condition that the mass swept up by the blastwave , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "an initially collimated outflow becomes non - relativistic at @xmath48 d @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the jet expands sideways ( at @xmath49 ) the outflow approaches spherical symmetry on a timescale , @xmath50 d , similar to @xmath5 .",
    "thus , regardless of the initial geometry of the outflow the non - relativistic expansion is well - approximated as a spherical outflow .",
    "we note that this discussion can be generalized to a range of radial density profiles . here , in addition to the  model , we focus on a density profile , @xmath51 ( hereafter , ) , appropriate for mass loss with a constant rate , @xmath52 , and speed , @xmath53 @xcite .    following the transition to non - relativistic expansion",
    ", the dynamical evolution of the blastwave is described by the sedov - taylor self - similar solution @xcite . in this case the radius of the shock is given by @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "thus , in the  case @xmath56 , while in the  case @xmath57 .",
    "the constant of proportionality , @xmath58 , depends on the adiabatic index of the gas , @xmath59 , and is equal to 1.05 in the  case and 0.65 in the  case for @xmath60 .",
    "the latter is appropriate for pressure equilibrium between relativistic electrons and non - relativistic protons @xcite .",
    "the circumburst material shocked by the blastwave is confined downstream to a thin shell of width @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .    to calculate the synchrotron emission emerging from this shock - heated material",
    "we make the usual assumptions .",
    "first , the relativistic electrons are assumed to obey a power - law distribution , @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "second , the energy densities in the magnetic field and electrons are assumed to be a non - varying fraction ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ) of the shock energy density .",
    "coupled with the synchrotron emissivity and taking into account self - absorption , the flux received by an observer at frequency @xmath67 and time @xmath68 is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath69^{5/2}(1-e^{-\\tau } ) f_3(\\nu/\\nu_m ) f_2^{-1}(\\nu/\\nu_m ) , \\label{eqn : ff}\\ ] ] the optical depth is given by : @xmath70^{-(p+4)/2 }",

    ". equations  [ eqn : ff][eqn : f ] include the appropriate redshift transformations to the rest - frame of the burst .",
    "based on the temporal scalings the synchrotron flux in the optically - thin regime ( @xmath84 ) evolves as @xmath85 ( ) or @xmath86 ( ) ; here the synchrotron self - absorption frequency , @xmath87 , is defined by the condition @xmath88 .",
    "thus , for @xmath84 the transition to non - relativistic expansion is manifested as a steepening of the light curves at @xmath5 if the outflow is spherical @xcite , or a flattening if the outflow was initially collimated @xcite .",
    "below , we use this behavior to estimate @xmath5 for grbs 980703 and 970508/    in  [ sec:98 ] and",
    " [ sec:97 ] we use the temporal decay indices and equations  [ eqn : ff][eqn : f ] to carry out a least - squares fit to the data at @xmath89 with the free parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these parameters are in turn used to calculate the physical parameters of interest , namely @xmath42 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ; @xmath97 is the shocked electron density @xcite . since only three spectral parameters are available , this leaves the radius unconstrained and thus , @xmath98 in the  model , the density is appropriate at @xmath99 , i.e. , @xmath100 .    to determine the radius of the blastwave a further constraint is needed .",
    "we note that the energy contained in the electrons and magnetic field can not exceed the thermal energy of the sedov - taylor blastwave , which accounts for about half of the total energy @xcite .",
    "the energy in the electrons is given by @xmath101n_e\\gamma_m m_ec^2 v$ ] , while the energy in the magnetic field is @xmath102 ; here @xmath103 is the volume of the synchrotron emitting shell .",
    "thus , using equations  [ eqn : b][eqn : cn ] and the condition @xmath104 we can constrain the range of allowed values of @xmath42 . in the  model @xmath105^{-2}$ ] , while in the  model @xmath106^{-2}$ ] .    with a constraint on the radius we can also ensure self - consistency by calculating the velocity of the blastwave when it enters the sedov - taylor phase , @xmath107 ( ) or @xmath108 ( ) .",
    "we expect that roughly @xmath109 .",
    "finally , the isotropic - equivalent mass of the ejecta is given by @xmath110 ( ) or @xmath111 ( ) . the actual ejecta mass is reduced by a factor @xmath23 relative to this value .",
    "in figure  [ fig : lc98 ] we plot the radio light curves of grb980703 .",
    "the data are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two gross changes in the light curves evolution are evident : a flattening at @xmath112 d at 4.9 and 8.5 ghz and a transition to a constant flux density at late time .",
    "the latter is due to radio emission from the host galaxy of grb980703 with flux densities at 1.4 , 4.9 and 8.5 ghz of 65 , 50 and 40 @xmath113jy , respectively @xcite .",
    "the flattening at @xmath112 d marks the transition to non - relativistic evolution following a period of sideways expansion of the initially collimated outflow ( figure  [ fig : lc98 ] ) . a similar value , @xmath114 d has been inferred by @xcite from tracking the evolution of the blastwave lorentz factor in the relativistic phase .",
    "we therefore use here @xmath115 d.    we follow the method outlined in  [ sec : method ] using both the  and  cases .",
    "the results of both fits , shown in figure  [ fig : lc98 ] , are overall indistinguishable . in what follows we quote the results of the  model .",
    "the best - fit parameters ( @xmath116 for 45 degrees of freedom ) are : @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the relatively large values of @xmath121 is due primarily to fluctuations induced by interstellar scintillation , particularly at 4.9 ghz .    using @xmath122 ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 km s@xmath125 mpc@xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) , and equations  [ eqn : b][eqn : cn ] we find @xmath128 g , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 @xmath131 .",

    "these results are plotted in figures  [ fig : e98 ]  and  [ fig : bn98 ] .",
    "the range of blastwave radii allowed by the constraint @xmath135 is @xmath136 , resulting in a range of values for the sedov - taylor energy , @xmath137 erg .",
    "given the strong dependence on radius , the ratio of energy in the electrons to the energy in the magnetic field ranges from @xmath138 , while the specific values range from @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the circumburst density is in the range @xmath141 @xmath131 , while the blastwave velocity is @xmath142 . finally , the isotropic - equivalent mass of the ejecta ranges from @xmath143 m@xmath19 .",
    "a comparison to the values derived by @xcite using modeling of the afterglow emission in the relativistic phase is useful .",

    "using the same density in our model ( figure  [ fig : bn98 ] ) , as required by the  density profile , gives a radius @xmath147 and hence @xmath148 and @xmath149 , in rough agreement ; the energy is @xmath150 erg .",
    "if we assume alternatively that the energy in relativistic electrons and the magnetic field are in equipartition , we find @xmath151 . in this case , @xmath152 erg , @xmath153 @xmath131 , @xmath154 g , and @xmath155 .",
    "the non - relativistic evolution of grb970508 was studied by @xcite .",
    "these authors provide a rough model for the radio emission beyond @xmath4 d and argue that the constraint @xmath156 requires the electron and magnetic field energy to be in equipartition , @xmath157 , with @xmath158 erg . here",
    "we perform a full least - squares fit , using @xmath159 d , and find somewhat different results .",
    "we use @xmath4 d , noting that for grb970508 the outflow appears to be weakly - collimated @xcite , and hence the transition is manifested as a mild steepening of the light curves ( see  [ sec : method ] ) .    the best - fit parameters in the model ( @xmath160 for 58 degrees of freedom )",
    "are : @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",

    "the formal @xmath171 values for these solutions are @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively , somewhat worse than the solution found here .    as a result",

    "assuming equipartition , we find @xmath193 , @xmath194 erg , and @xmath195 .",
    "the derived energy is about a factor of four higher than the previous estimate @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our best - fit model with the flux of the afterglow in the optical @xmath196-band at @xmath197 d , @xmath198 @xmath113jy @xcite , indicates a break in the spectrum . if we interpret this break as due to the synchrotron cooling frequency , above which the spectrum is given by @xmath199 , we find @xmath200 hz . since @xmath201 hz we infer @xmath202 g and hence @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "these values are in rough agreement with those inferred from modeling of the relativistic phase @xcite , although our value of @xmath65 is somewhat lower .",
    "the energies derived in  [ sec:98 ] and  [ sec:97 ] are in fact lower limits on the initial kinetic energy of the blastwave due to synchrotron radiative losses .",
    "these play a role primarily in the fast - cooling regime ( @xmath207 ) , which dominates in the early stages of the afterglow evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimate the time at which fast - cooling ends , @xmath208 and @xmath209 days after the burst for grb970508 and grb980703 , respectively . using these values , and our best estimate of @xmath148 ( 980703 ) and @xmath210 ( 970508 )",
    ", we calculate the radiative corrections , @xmath211 , going back from @xmath5 to about 90 s after the burst . here",
    "@xmath212 , with @xmath213 for @xmath214 and it is quenched by a factor @xmath215 at later times .",
    "thus , at low values of @xmath66 the radiative losses are negligible .",
    "the cutoff at 90 s corresponds to the approximate deceleration time of the ejecta , @xmath216 s.    we find that approximately @xmath217 and @xmath218 of the energy was radiated away before @xmath5 for grbs 980703 and 970508 , respectively .",
    "thus , the initial kinetic energies are estimated to be @xmath219 erg and @xmath220 erg , respectively .",
    "the corrections from @xmath5 back to @xmath221 , @xmath222 for grb980703 and @xmath223 for grb970508 , indicate @xmath224 and @xmath225 erg , respectively .",
    "both estimates of the energy are in excellent agreement with those inferred from the relativistic evolution of the fireball at @xmath221 @xcite , @xmath226 erg ( 980703 ) and @xmath227 erg ( 970508 ) .",
    "analysis of the synchrotron emission from a grb blastwave in the non - relativistic phase has the advantage that it is independent of geometry and is described by the well - understood sedov - taylor self - similar solution . using this approach to model the late - time radio emission from grbs 980703 ( @xmath228 d ) and",
    "970508 ( @xmath229 d ) we infer kinetic energies in the range @xmath230 erg and @xmath231 erg , respectively . including the effect of radiative losses starting at @xmath232 s , we find that the initial kinetic energies were about @xmath219 erg and @xmath233 erg , respectively .",
    "the inferred kinetic energies confirm , independent of any assumptions about the existence or opening angles of jets , that the energy scale of grbs is @xmath234 erg .",
    "we therefore unambiguously rule out the recent claim of @xcite that the energy scale of grbs is of the order of @xmath39 erg .",
    "since the claimed low energies were based on the apparent correlation between @xmath235 and the energy at which the prompt emission spectrum peaks , @xmath236 @xcite , we conclude that this relation , and the prompt emission in general , does not provide a reliable measure of the total energy . as a corollary",
    ", we rule out the narrow jet opening angles used by @xcite , @xmath237 and thus confirm that the true grb rate is significantly lower than the rate of type ib / c sne @xcite .    finally , the overall agreement between the energies derived here and those inferred from modeling of the relativistic phase of the afterglow indicates that the central engine in grbs 980703 and 970508 did not produce a significant amount of energy in mildly relativistic ejecta ( @xmath238 ) at late time , @xmath239 .",
    "however , a comparison to the beaming - corrected @xmath0-ray energies @xcite , @xmath240 erg ( grb980703 ) and @xmath241 erg ( grb970508 ) reveals that the efficiency of the blastwave in producing @xmath0-rays , @xmath242 , varies considerably : @xmath243 for grb980703 , but only @xmath244 for grb970508 .",
    "the wide dispersion in @xmath242 strengthens the conclusion that @xmath7 is not a reliable tracer of the total energy @xcite .    the low value of @xmath242 for grb970508 may indicate an injection of energy from mildly relativistic ejecta at early time .",
    "both the optical and x - ray light curves of this burst exhibited a sharp increase in flux approximately 1 day after the burst , by a factor of about 4 and @xmath245 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the flux in these bands depends on energy as @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , if we interpret the flux increase as due to injection of energy from ejecta with @xmath248 @xcite we find an energy increase of about a factor of three .",
    "the analysis performed here provides an estimate of the total energy following the injection and thus @xmath242 appears to be low .",
    "the actual value of @xmath242 is thus @xmath249 .",
    "although grbs 980703 and 970508 are currently the only bursts with sufficient radio data to warrant the full sedov - taylor analysis , flattening of radio light curves at late time have been noted in several other cases , most notably grbs 980329 , 991208 , 000301c , 000418 and 000926 @xcite . interpreting the flattening as a transition to non - relativistic expansion and using the expression for the flux at @xmath250 ghz at the time of the transition , @xmath251^{-1/2}\\epsilon_{e,-1}\\epsilon_{b,-1}^{3/4 } n_0^{3/4}e_{51}d_{28}^{-2}$ ] @xmath113jy @xcite , we find the rough results @xmath252 ( 980329 ) , @xmath253 ( 991208 ) , @xmath254 ( 000301c ) , @xmath255 ( 000418 ) , and @xmath256 ( 000926 ) .",
    "thus , for typical densities , @xmath257 @xmath131 @xcite , the inferred kinetic energies are again of the order of @xmath258 erg .",
    "this leads to the following conclusions .",
    "first , the energy scale of cosmological bursts is about @xmath6 erg , at least three orders of magnitude higher than the kinetic energies in fast ejecta determined for local type ib / c sne from radio observations @xcite , and an order of magnitude higher relative to the nearby ( @xmath259 mpc ) grb980425 associated with sn1998bw @xcite and grb031203 ( @xmath260 ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , as already noted in the case of grb030329 @xcite , there is a wide dispersion in the fraction of energy in ultra - relativistic ejecta , such that the @xmath0-rays are a poor proxy for the total energy produced by the engine .",
    "thus , radio calorimetry is uniquely suited for addressing the relation between various cosmic explosions .",
    "so far , such studies reveal a common energy scale in relativistic ejecta of about 5 foe ( @xmath261 erg ) for cosmological grbs @xcite , about 0.1 foe for the low redshift bursts ( 980425 , 031203 ) , and @xmath262 foe in fast ejecta for type ib / c sne .",
    "the open question now is whether we are beginning to trace a continuum in the energetics of cosmic explosions , or whether the various classes truly represent distinct physical mechanisms with different energy scales .",
    "fortunately , the best example to date of an object possibly bridging the various populations , grb030329 , still shines brightly in the radio a year after the burst .",
