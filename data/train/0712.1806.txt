    "the matrix product state ( mps ) description @xcite has brought a new way of approaching many - body quantum systems .",

    "vidal s time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm @xcite @xcite uses mps and emphasizes entanglement ( as measured by the schmidt number ) , directing the computational resources into that bottleneck of the simulation .",
    "it provides the ability to simulate time evolution and it was shown that mps - inspired methods handle periodic boundary conditions well in one dimension @xcite , areas where the previous use of dmrg was limited .",

    "a combination of peps with itebd called ipeps @xcite provides a possibility of investigating infinite translationally invariant systems in higher dimensions .",
    "our contribution is a method to investigate the ground state properties of infinite translationally invariant quantum systems on the bethe lattice using imaginary time evolution with matrix product states .",
    "the bethe lattice is an infinite tree with each node having three neighbors , as depicted in fig.[figinfitree ] .",
    "it is translationally invariant in that it looks the same at every vertex .",
    "this geometry is interesting , because of the following connection to large random graphs with fixed valence . moving out from any vertex in such a random graph , you need to go a distance of order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of vertices in the graph , before you detect that you are not on the bethe lattice , that is , before you see a loop .",
    "we choose to investigate the quantum transverse field ising model on the bethe lattice .",
    "note that we work directly on the infinite system , never taking a limit .",
    "first we test the itebd method on a system with a known exact solution , the infinite line .",
    "then we turn to the bethe lattice with the new method we provide . in both cases ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where the sum over @xmath3 is over all sites , and the sum over @xmath4 is over all bonds ( nearest neighbors ) .",
    "we show that imaginary time evolution within the mps ansatz provides a very good approximation for the exact ground state on an infinite line , giving us nearly correct critical exponents for the magnetization and correlation length as we approach the phase transition .",
    "we obtain new results for the quantum ising model in transverse field on the infinite tree . similarly to the infinite line",
    ", we observe a second order phase transition and obtain the critical exponent for the magnetization , @xmath5 ( different than the mean - field result ) .",
    "however , the correlation length does not diverge at the phase transition for this system and we conjecture that it has the value @xmath6 .",
    "we also investigate a model where besides an antiferromagnetic interaction of spins we add a specific longitudinal field @xmath7 for each spin : @xmath8 we choose the longitudinal field in such a way that the interaction term in the computational basis takes a simple form , @xmath9 , giving an energy penalty to the @xmath10 state of neighboring spins .",

    "we turn to the not 00 model in section [ not00section ] and show that our numerics work well for this system even when there is a high ground state degeneracy . in section [ stabilitysection ]",
    "we investigate the stability of our tree results and conjecture that they may be good approximations to a local description far from the boundary of a large finite tree system .",
    "if one s goal is to numerically investigate a system governed by a local hamiltonian , it is convenient to find a local description and update rules for the system .",
    "a matrix product state description is particularly suited to spin systems for which the connections do not form any loops . given a state of this system",
    ", we will first show how to obtain its mps description , and then how to utilize this description in a numerical method for obtaining the time evolution and approximating the ground state ( using imaginary time evolution ) .",
    "we begin with matrix product states on a line ( a spin chain ) , and then generalize the description to a tree geometry . in [ updatesection ] , we give a numerical method of updating the mps description for both real and imaginary time simulations .",
    "given a state @xmath16 of a chain of @xmath1 spins @xmath17 we wish to rewrite the coefficients @xmath18 as a matrix product ( see @xcite for a review of mps ) @xmath19 using @xmath1 tensors @xmath20 and @xmath21 vectors @xmath22 .",

    ", one has to perform the following steps .",

    "this gives us the tensor @xmath20 .",

    "from we have @xmath43 while implies @xmath44 and @xmath45      matrix product states are natural not just on chains , but also on trees , because these can also be split into two subsystems by cutting a single bond , allowing for the schmidt - decomposition interpretation as described in the previous section .",
    "the matrix product state description of a state of a spin system on a tree , i.e. such that the bonds do not form loops , is a generalization of the above procedure .",
    "tree - tensor - network descriptions such as ours have been previously described in @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the bethe lattice with 3 neighbors per spin , we introduce a vector @xmath46 for each bond @xmath47 and a four - index ( one for spin , three for bonds ) tensor @xmath48 for each site @xmath3 .",
    "we can then rewrite the state @xmath16 analogously to , as @xmath49 where @xmath50 are indices corresponding to the three bonds @xmath51 and @xmath1 coming out of site @xmath3 .",
    "each index @xmath52 appears in two @xmath27 tensors and one @xmath26 vector . to obtain this description",
    ", one needs to perform a schmidt decomposition across each bond .",
    "this produces the vectors @xmath53 .",
    "tensor for the marked site and the three @xmath26 vectors for the bonds emanating from it.,width=336 ]    to obtain the tensor @xmath20 for site @xmath3 , one needs to combine the three decompositions corresponding to the bonds of site @xmath3 as depicted in fig.[figtreeschmidt ] .",
    "analogously to , expressing the orthonormal basis for the first subsystem marked in fig.[figtreeschmidt ] in terms of the state of the spin @xmath54 and the orthonormal bases for the latter two subsystems in fig.[figtreeschmidt ] , one obtains the tensor @xmath55 for site @xmath3 .",
    "the normalization conditions for a mps description of a state on a tree are analogous to - .",
    "we have @xmath56 @xmath57 and two other variations of with @xmath58 and @xmath59 interchanged .",
    "we choose to first describe the numerical procedures for a chain of spins .",
    "then , at the end of the respective subsections , we note how to generalize these to tree geometry .",
    "the strength of the mps description of the state lies in the efficient application of local unitary update rules such as @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is an operator acting only on a few qubits ) .",
    "first , we describe the numerical procedure in some detail , and then , in the next section , discuss how to modify the procedure to also implement imaginary time evolution .    given a state @xmath16 as a matrix product state , we want to know what happens after an application of a local unitary .",
    "in particular , for a 1-local @xmath62 acting on the @xmath3-th spin , it suffices to update the local tensor @xmath63 the update rule for an application of a 2-local unitary @xmath64 acting on neighboring spins @xmath3 and @xmath31 , requires several steps .",
    "first , using a larger tensor @xmath65 we rewrite the state @xmath16 as @xmath66 after the application of @xmath64 , the tensor @xmath67 in the description of @xmath16 changes as @xmath68 one now needs to decompose the updated tensor @xmath67 to obtain the updated tensors @xmath20 , @xmath69 and the vector @xmath22 .",
    "we use the indices @xmath70 and @xmath71 of @xmath67 to introduce combined indices @xmath72 and @xmath73 and form a matrix @xmath74 with dimensions @xmath75 as @xmath76 using the singular value decomposition ( svd ) , this matrix can be decomposed into @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are unitary and @xmath80 is a diagonal matrix . in terms of matrix elements , this reads @xmath81 the diagonal matrix @xmath82 gives us the updated schmidt vector @xmath22 .",
    "the updated tensors @xmath20 and @xmath69 can be obtained from the matrices @xmath83 and the definition of @xmath67 using the old vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 which do not change with the application of the local unitary @xmath64 .",
    "after these update procedures , the conditions - are maintained .",
    "the usefulness / succintness of this description depends crucially on the amount of entanglement across the bipartite divisions of the system as measured by the schmidt numbers @xmath86 . to exactly describe a general quantum state @xmath16 of a chain of @xmath1 spins ,",
    "the schmidt number for the split through the middle of the chain is necessarily @xmath87 .",
    "suppose we start our numerical simulation in a state that is exactly described by a mps with only low @xmath86 s .",
    "the update step described above involves an interaction of two sites , and thus could generate more entanglement across the @xmath88 division .",
    "after the update , the index @xmath40 in @xmath89 would need to run from @xmath90 to @xmath91 to keep the description exact ( unless @xmath86 already is at its maximum required value @xmath92 ) .",
    "this makes the number of parameters in the mps description grow exponentially with the number of update steps .",
    "so far , this description and update rules have been exact .",
    "let us now make the description an approximate one ( use a block - decimation step ) instead .",
    "first , introduce the parameter @xmath93 , which is the maximum number of schmidt terms we keep after each update step .",
    "if the amount of entanglement in the system is low , the schmidt coefficients @xmath89 decrease rapidly with @xmath40 ( we always take the elements of @xmath26 sorted in decreasing order ) . a mps ansatz with restricted @xmath94 will hopefully be a good approximation to the exact state @xmath16 .",
    "however , we also need to keep the restricted @xmath93 throughout the simulation .",
    "after a two - local unitary update step , the vector @xmath22 can have @xmath95 entries .",
    "however , if the @xmath96 entries in @xmath89 after the update are small , we are justified to truncate @xmath22 to have only @xmath93 entries and multiply it by a number so that it satisfies .",
    "we also truncate the @xmath27 tensors so that they keep dimensions @xmath97 .",
    "the normalization condition for @xmath20 will be still satisfied exactly , while the error in the normalization condition will be small .",
    "this normalization error can be corrected as discussed in the next section .",
    "this procedure keeps us within the mps ansatz with restricted @xmath93 .",
    "the procedure described above allows us to efficiently approximately implement local unitary evolution . to simulate time evolution @xmath98 with a local hamiltonian like",
    ", we first divide the time @xmath99 into small slices @xmath100 and split the hamiltonian into two groups of commuting terms @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "each time evolution step @xmath103 can then be implemented as a product of local unitaries using the second order trotter - suzuki formula @xmath104 the application of the product of the local unitaries within each group can be done almost in parallel ( in two steps , as described in section [ tisection ] ) , as they commute with each other .",
    "these update rules allow us to efficiently approximately simulate the real time evolution with a local hamiltonian @xmath105 for a state @xmath16 within the mps ansatz with parameter @xmath93 .",
    "the number of parameters in this mps description with restricted @xmath93 is then @xmath106 for the tensors @xmath20 and @xmath107 for the vectors @xmath22 . the simulation cost of each local update step scales like @xmath108 , coming from the svd decomposition of the matrix @xmath67 . for a system of @xmath1 spins ,",
    "we thus need to store @xmath109 numbers and each update will take @xmath110 steps .",
    "the update procedure generalizes to tree geometry by taking the tensors @xmath27 with dimensions @xmath111 as in section [ mpstreesubsection ] . for a local update ( on two neighboring spins @xmath3 and @xmath31 with bonds labeled by @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) we rewrite the state @xmath16 analogously to as @xmath114 using the tensor @xmath115 with combined indices @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "one then needs to update the tensor @xmath67 as described above - .",
    "the decomposition procedure to get the updated vector @xmath118 and the new tensors @xmath20 and @xmath69 now requires @xmath119 computational steps .",
    "the cost of a simulation on @xmath1 spins thus scales like @xmath120 .      using the mps ansatz",
    ", we can also use imaginary time evolution with @xmath121 instead of to look for the ground state of systems governed by local hamiltonians .",
    "one needs to replace each unitary term @xmath122 in the trotter expansion of the time evolution with @xmath123 followed by a normalization procedure .",
    "however , the usual normalization procedure for imaginary time evolution ( multiplying the state by a number to keep @xmath124 ) is now not enough to satisfy the mps normalization conditions - for the tensors @xmath27 and vectors @xmath26 we use to describe the state @xmath16 .",
    "the unitarity of the real time evolution automatically implied that the normalization conditions , were satisfied after an exact unitary update .",
    "while there already was an error in introduced by the truncation of the @xmath125 entries in @xmath20 , the non - unitarity of imaginary time evolution update steps introduces further normalization errors .",
    "it is thus important to properly normalize the state after every application of terms like @xmath126 to keep it within the mps ansatz .    in @xcite ,",
    "vidal dealt with this problem by taking progressively shorter and shorter steps @xmath100 during the imaginary time evolution .",
    "this procedure results in a properly normalized state only at the end of the evolution , after the time step decreases to zero ( and not necessarily during the evolution ) .",
    "we propose a different scheme in which we follow each local update @xmath127 by a normalization procedure ( based on vidal s observation ) to bring the state back to the mps ansatz at all times .",
    "the simulation we run ( evolution for time @xmath99 ) thus consists of many short time step updates @xmath128 , each of which is implemented using a trotter expansion as a product of local updates @xmath127 .",
    "each of these local updates is followed by our normalization procedure .",
    "we now describe the iterative normalization procedure in detail for the case of an infinite chain , where it can be applied efficiently , as the description of the state @xmath16 requires only two different tensors @xmath27 ( see section [ tiline ] ) .",
    "one needs to apply the following steps over and over , until the normalization conditions are met with chosen accuracy .",
    "first , for each nearest neighbor pair @xmath88 with even @xmath3 , combine the mps description of these two spins - , forming the matrix @xmath129 . do a svd decomposition of @xmath129 to obtain a new vector @xmath22 .",
    "the decomposition does not increase the number of nonzero elements of @xmath22 , as the rank of the @xmath130 matrix @xmath129 was only @xmath93 ( coming from ) .",
    "we thus take only the first @xmath93 values of @xmath22 and rescale the vector to obey @xmath131 . using this new @xmath22",
    ", we obtain tensors @xmath20 , @xmath69 from , and truncate them to have dimensions @xmath132 .",
    "second , we repeat the previous steps for all nearest neighbor pairs of spins @xmath88 with @xmath3 odd .",
    "we observe that repeating the above steps over and over results in exponential decrease in the error in the normalization of the @xmath27 tensors .",
    "we note though , that the rate of decrease in normalization errors becomes much slower near the phase transition for the transverse field ising model on an infinite line ( see section [ nrsection1 ] ) .    in practice",
    ", we apply this normalization procedure by using the same subroutine for the local updates @xmath126 , except that we skip the step , which is equivalent to applying the local update with @xmath133 .",
    "the normalization procedure is thus equivalent to evolving the state repeatedly with zero time step ( composing two tensors @xmath27 and decomposing them again ) and imposing the normalization condition on the vectors @xmath26 .",
    "note though , following from the definition of the svd , that each decomposition assures us that one of the conditions , is retained exactly for the updated tensors @xmath27 .",
    "the errors in the other normalization condition for the @xmath27 tensors are decreased in each iteration step .",
    "the numerical update rules for a system with tree geometry are a simple analogue of the update rules for mps on spin chains .",
    "every interaction couples two sites , with tensors @xmath134 and @xmath135 , with the three lower indices corresponding to the bonds emanating from the sites .",
    "one only needs to reshape the tensors into @xmath136 and @xmath137 and proceed as described in and below .",
    "for systems with translational symmetry such as an infinite line all the sites are equivalent .",
    "we assume that the ground state is translationally invariant , and furthermore pick the tensors @xmath20 and vectors @xmath22 to be site independent . for fixed @xmath93 the number of complex parameters in the translationally invariant mps ansatz on the infinite line scales as @xmath138 .    when using imaginary time evolution to look for the ground state of this system , within this ansatz , it is technically hard to keep the translational symmetry and the normalization conditions after each update",
    "numerical instabilities plagued our efforts to impose the symmetry in the procedures described above . in @xcite ,",
    "vidal devised a method to deal with this problem .",
    "let us break the translational symmetry of the ansatz by labeling the sites @xmath61 and @xmath139 as in fig.[figlineab ] .",
    "this doubles the number of parameters in the ansatz .",
    "the state update now proceeds in two steps .",
    "let the site pairs @xmath140 interact and update the tensors @xmath141 , @xmath142 and the vector @xmath143 .",
    "then let the neighbor pairs @xmath144 interact , after which we update the tensors @xmath142 , @xmath141 and the vector @xmath145 .",
    "what we observe is that after many state updates the elements of the resulting @xmath141 and the @xmath142 tensors differ at a level which is way below our numerical accuracy ( governed by the normalization errors ) and we are indeed obtaining a translationally invariant description of the system .",
    "one of the systems easily investigated with this method ( itebd ) is the ising model in a transverse field on an infinite line .",
    "vidal s numerical results for the real time evolution and imaginary time evolution @xcite of this system show remarkable agreement with the exact solution .",
    "we take a step further and also numerically obtain the critical exponents for this system .",
    "further details can be found in section [ nrsection ] , where we compare these results for the infinite line to the results we obtain for the ising model in transverse field on the bethe lattice .      for the infinite bethe lattice ,",
    "our approach is a modification of the above procedure introduced by vidal . in order to avoid the numerical instabilities associated with imposing site - independent @xmath27 and @xmath26 after the update steps",
    ", we break the translational symmetry by labeling the `` layers '' of the tree @xmath61 and @xmath139 ( denoted by half - circles and triangles ) , as in fig.[figtreeab ] .",
    "the bethe lattice is also symmetric under the permutation of directions .",
    "tensors @xmath27 with full directional symmetry obey @xmath146 . however ,",
    "for the purpose of simple organization of interactions , we will also partially break this symmetry by consistently labeling an ` inward ' bond for each node , as denoted by the flat sides of the semi - circles and the longer edges of the triangles in fig.[figtreeab ] .",
    "this makes the first of the three indices of @xmath147 special .",
    "however , we keep the residual symmetry @xmath148 . this we can enforce by interacting a spin with both of the spins from the next layer at the same time .",
    "the update procedure for the interaction between the spins now splits into two steps , interacting the layers in the @xmath140 order first , and then in the @xmath144 order as in fig.[figtreeabinteract ] .",
    "similarly to what we discovered for the line , the differences in the elements of the final @xmath141 and @xmath142 are well below the numerical accuracy of our procedure .",
    "the scaling of this procedure is more demanding than the @xmath108 simulation for a line .",
    "the number of entries in the matrix @xmath67 used in each update step is @xmath149 , therefore the svd decomposition requires @xmath150 steps .",
    "the scaling of our numerical method is thus @xmath150 for each update step .",
    "a nice property of the mps state description is that it allows efficient computation of expectation values of local operators .",
    "first , for a translationally invariant system on a line ( with only one tensor @xmath27 and one vector @xmath26 ) , we have for an operator @xmath151 acting only on the @xmath3-th spin @xmath152 where @xmath153 .",
