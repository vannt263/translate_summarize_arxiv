    "the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe ( bau ) , which amounts to a baryon - to - photon ratio of number densities @xmath3  @xcite , provides one of the strongest pieces of evidence for physics beyond the standard model  ( sm )  @xcite . one interesting scenario for explaining the bau is leptogenesis  @xcite . a potentially interesting alternative to gut - scale leptogenesis",
    "is the framework of low - scale resonant leptogenesis ( rl )  @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "the lowering of the scale may rely on a dynamical mechanism , in which heavy - neutrino self - energy effects  @xcite on the leptonic asymmetry become dominant  @xcite and get resonantly enhanced  @xcite , when a pair of heavy majorana neutrinos has a mass difference comparable to the heavy neutrino decay widths .",
    "flavour effects due to heavy - neutrino yukawa couplings  @xcite play an important role in models of rl  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite a scenario was put forward , called resonant @xmath0-leptogenesis  ( r@xmath0l ) , in which the bau originates from a @xmath0-lepton asymmetry , resonantly produced by quasi - in - equilibrium decays of heavy majorana neutrinos . in a r@xmath0l model ,",
    "the generated excess in the @xmath4 number will be converted into the observed bau , provided the @xmath4-violating reactions are not strong enough to wash out such an excess .",
    "in such a scenario , the heavy majorana neutrinos can be as light as 100  gev and have sizeable couplings to two of the charged leptons , specifically to electrons and muons .",
    "consequently , depending on the flavour dynamics of heavy neutrino yukawa coupling effects , phenomenologically testable models of rl can be built that could be probed at the lhc or in low energy experiments of lepton number violation  ( lnv ) and lepton flavour violation  ( lfv ) , such as @xmath5 and neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "as we demonstrated in @xcite , r@xmath6l models can be constructed with a degenerate heavy neutrino mass spectrum at the gut scale . in a minimal non - supersymmetric framework ,",
    "the splittings required for successful rl are generated radiatively  @xcite by renormalization group ( rg ) evolution and can therefore be naturally comparable to the decay widths of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "the leptonic yukawa and majorana sectors of the sm symmetrically extended with one singlet right - handed neutrino @xmath7 per @xmath8 family ( with @xmath9 ) are given by the lagrangian @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the sm higgs doublet and @xmath12 its isospin conjugate .",
    "moreover , we have suppressed the generation index @xmath8 from the left - handed doublets @xmath13 , the right - handed charged leptons @xmath14 and the right - handed neutrinos @xmath7 , while ordinary multiplication between vectors and matrices is implied .    to obtain a phenomenologically relevant model in this minimal setup , at least 3 singlet heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath15 are needed and these have to be nearly degenerate in mass  @xcite . to ensure the latter",
    ", we assume that to leading order , the singlet majorana sector is so(3 ) symmetric , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 identity matrix and @xmath19 is a general so(3)-breaking matrix induced by rg effects . as we will discuss below , compatibility with the observed light neutrino masses and mixings requires that @xmath20 , for electroweak - mass majorana neutrinos , i.e.  for @xmath211  tev .",
    "we will explicitly demonstrate , how such an so(3)-breaking matrix @xmath22 , of the required order , can be generated radiatively via the rg evolution of the right - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath23 from the gut scale @xmath24 to the mass scale of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath25 .    in the physical charged - lepton mass basis , the so(3 ) symmetry imposed on the singlet majorana sector at the gut scale @xmath26",
    "gets explicitly broken by a set of neutrino yukawa couplings to the subgroup of lepton symmetries : @xmath27 .",

    "the light neutrinos remain massless to all orders in perturbation theory , whilst @xmath31 and @xmath32 are free unconstrained complex parameters .",
    "the phases accompanying these parameters in  ( [ hnutau ] ) are simply chosen for convenience to maximize the lepton asymmetry in leptogenesis when @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real . in order to give masses to the light neutrinos",
    ", the second term describes the departure from the flavour symmetric limit with @xmath33 and the phases @xmath34 are unrestricted .",
    "it is important to notice that the flavour structure of the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath35 is preserved through the rg evolution , as long as the flavour symmetry is only weakly broken . in detail ,",
    "rg effects violate the so(3)-invariant form of the majorana mass matrix @xmath36 by the 3-by-3 matrix @xmath37 . in the leading - log approximation , the so(3)-breaking matrix @xmath38 receives the following radiative corrections : @xmath39.\\ ] ] given the form invariance of @xmath40 under rg effects , we may therefore define all input parameters at the right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath25 , where the matching with the light neutrino data is performed .",
    "we may now determine the yukawa parameters @xmath41 , in terms of the light - neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 in the positive and diagonal charged lepton yukawa basis .",
    "to do so , we first notice that the chosen symmetry @xmath43 ensures the vanishing of the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath44 .",
    "however , the symmetry - breaking parameters induce a non - zero light neutrino mass matrix @xmath44 , which to leading order in these parameters is given by  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46  gev is the vacuum expectation value of the sm higgs field  @xmath11 . in deriving the last equation in  ( [ mnutree ] ) ,",

    "this in turn implies that for electroweak - scale heavy neutrinos @xmath54 , the symmetry - breaking yukawa couplings need not be much smaller than the electron yukawa coupling @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , one should observe that only a particular combination of so(3)-violating terms @xmath56 appears in @xmath53 through @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , for electroweak - scale heavy neutrinos with mass differences @xmath58 , one should have @xmath59 to avoid getting too large light neutrino masses much above  0.5  ev .",
    "finally , we note that one - loop @xmath60- and higgs - boson effects can induce additional contributions to the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "as well as being loop suppressed , these radiative contributions are proportional to the symmetry - breaking parameters and can therefore be neglected for the r@xmath0l scenario under study  @xcite .",
