    "it was classified as a bl lac object due to its featureless optical spectrum @xcite and significant optical variability @xcite .",
    "as occurs in most bl lac objects , the featureless optical spectrum prevents a spectroscopic redshift measurement .",
    "however , several limits have been provided based on indirect measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most recent redshift lower limit was estimated assuming that the host galaxy can be used as a standard candle . for absolute r band magnitudes",
    "mr = -22.5 and mr = -22.9 , @xcite obtains the limits @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "previously , a more stringent redshift lower limit of @xmath10 was set by @xcite based on the detection of intervening ly@xmath7 absorbers .",
    "this estimation will be used throughout the paper . @xcite also set a redshift upper limit of @xmath11 based on the non - detection of any ly@xmath12 absorbers at @xmath10 .",
    "the vhe @xmath1-ray emission from pg  1553 + 113 was discovered independently and almost simultaneously by h.e.s.s . @xcite and magic @xcite in 2005 . the integral flux recorded by magic at the time of the discovery was @xmath13 above 120gev , and the differential energy spectrum was well described by a power law with a spectral index @xmath14 , compatible with the detection by h.e.s.s .",
    "the source has been monitored with the magic telescopes since 2005 .",
    "the results from the 2005 - 2009 observation campaigns can be found in @xcite .",
    "modest flux variability of a factor of @xmath152.6 on a yearly time - scale has been detected at e@xmath16150  gev , with an integral flux lying in the range from 1.4 to @xmath17 .",
    "the observed energy spectra were well fitted by power laws with photon indices in the range @xmath18 and compatible within uncertainties .",
    "extragalactic vhe @xmath1-rays can be absorbed on the way to the earth via electron - positron pair production when interacting with optical - uv background photons from the extragalactic background light ( ebl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ebl is mainly composed of diffuse optical light emitted by stars and partially reprocessed by dust in the ir , redshifted by the expansion of the universe @xcite . the uncertainty on its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and evolution through the history of the universe still ranges from 20% to 50% at wavelengths 0.4 and 40 microns , respectively .",
    "this uncertainty is mainly due to difficulties in direct measurements .    during the past few years",
    "several different approaches have been developed to model the ebl ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and despite the different techniques adopted the resulting ebl models show an overall agreement , differing only marginally .",
    "the @xmath1-ray absorption depends significantly on the energy of the vhe photon , the redshift - dependent sed of the ebl , and the distance to the source . the observed flux ( @xmath19 )",
    "can be expressed as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 denotes the intrinsic flux emitted by the source and @xmath22 the ebl optical depth as a function of the energy and redshift .",
    "the ebl imprint on the vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum can be used to set upper limits on the redshift of the source .",
    "this is done by assuming a particular ebl model and a criterion on the intrinsic spectrum , such as a maximum hardness for the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum or the absence of a spectral break with a pile - up at vhe in the reconstructed spectrum .",
    "different authors have used this @xmath1-ray attenuation technique for pg  1553 + 113 , leading to the following limits : @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "limits on the ebl absorption can be estimated independently from ebl models using the vhe spectrum and the redshift of the source under the assumption that the emission of the source can be properly described by a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model @xcite .",
    "this method has previously been used on pg  1553 + 113 to derive constraints on the @xmath1-ray horizon @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the ebl density relative to that of a given model can be evaluated through the joint analysis of the he or vhe observations of many extragalactic sources , making relatively small assumptions on the shape of the intrinsic spectra @xcite .",
    "pg  1553 + 113 was detected in the high - energy ( he , @xmath29mev ) @xmath1-ray band by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "the energy spectrum for the period 2008 august - 2010 august can be well fitted by a power law with spectral index @xmath30 and f(@xmath31)=@xmath32 and its variability index is 93.5 @xcite .",
    "since the variability index is @xmath16 41.6 the source is variable on a monthly time - scale at @xmath1699% confidence probability .",
    "no flaring activity has been claimed for pg  1553@xmath33113 in the he band to date .",
    "remarkably , a periodic factor - of - two flux enhancement on a monthly time scale over 6 years of fermi operation has been recently found by @xcite .",
    "an extensive multi - wavelength ( mwl ) observation campaign on pg  1553 + 113 was carried out from 2012 february to june , focused on the characterization of its sed as well as the variability of the source emission at different frequencies .",

    "we evaluated the significance of the @xmath1-ray signal from the source by means of the maximum - likelihood test statistic ts = 2 ( log@xmath48 - log@xmath49 ) , where @xmath50 is the likelihood of the data given the model with ( @xmath48 ) or without ( @xmath49 ) a point source at the position of pg 1553@xmath33113 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", the normalization factors and the photon indices of the sources lying within 10@xmath46 of pg1553@xmath33113 were left as free parameters . for the sources located between 10@xmath46 and 15@xmath46 , we kept the normalization and the photon index fixed to the values from the 2fgl catalogue . integrating over the period from 2012 february 2 to june 10 ( mjd 55959 - 56088 ) the fit with a power - law model in the 0.1100 gev energy range results in a ts = 908 , with an integrated average flux of ( 5.7 @xmath54 @xmath55 ) @xmath5610@xmath57",

    "using a log - parabola ( lp ) , @xmath62 @xmath63 , the fit yielded for the same period a ts = 910 , with an average flux of ( 4.1 @xmath54 @xmath64 ) @xmath5610@xmath57 ph @xmath58 s@xmath59 , a spectral slope of @xmath7 = 1.49 @xmath54 @xmath65 at the reference energy @xmath66 = 2239 mev , and a curvature parameter @xmath12 = 0.08 @xmath54 @xmath67 .",

    "we , therefore , conclude , that no significant curvature was observed in the lat spectrum of pg 1553@xmath33113 during 2012 february - june due to the poor photon statistics .",

    "it is well fitted by a power law with an exponential cut - off or a logparabola .",
    "this curvature most likely originates from ebl absorption if the distance to the source is between the redshift limits measured by @xcite ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "if the real redshift of this source is higher than these limits , the effect would be a hardening of the spectrum or the ( unexpected ) presence of a pile - up in the intrinsic spectrum , which would denote that either the ebl models predict an overestimated ebl level , there is a second emission component at high energies or that more exotic physics needs to be invoked as axion - like particles ( alps ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the comparison with previous flux states of the source reveals that the higher frequency part of each sed bump shows higher variability than the lower frequency part .",

    "<S> a simple power - law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg1553 + 113 vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance ( fit probability p=2.6 @xmath4 ) . </S>",

    "<S> new constraints on the redshift are derived from the vhe spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints are compatible with previous limits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the optical lower limit , @xmath6 , based on the detection of ly@xmath7 absorption . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model gives a satisfactory description of the observed multi - wavelength spectral energy distribution during the flare .    </S>",
