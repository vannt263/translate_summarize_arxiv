    "the observation of a halo of checkerboard modulation in the local density of states ( ldos ) around magnetic field - induced vortex cores by hoffman _",
    "_ @xcite in optimally doped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 has focused attention on the nature of the spin and charge collective modes in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "charge order in this region was anticipated theoretically @xcite . by ` charge order ' we mean here periodic spatial modulations of all local observables invariant under spin rotations and time - reversal , such as the exchange and pairing energies , and the ldos itself .",
    "if the modulation is primarily on quantities defined on a bond , rather than in the charge density on a site , then such order is better denoted as ` bond order ' ; it was this bond order which was theoretically anticipated @xcite .",
    "the general connection relating such charge / bond order to the ` square ' of collinear , non - bipartite , spin correlations @xcite ( see section  [ model ] below ) was used to develop a model @xcite relating the spatial structure and energy spectrum of the charge order to the _ dynamic _ spin fluctuation spectrum as measured by neutron scattering @xcite",
    ". there have also been other discussions of competing order within vortex cores , including enhanced dynamic antiferromagnetism in a spin - gap state @xcite , static nel order @xcite , and other models with static spin density wave order @xcite .",
    "more recent measurements of howald _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the ldos modulations in the vortex halo also persists in zero magnetic field , albeit with a much weaker amplitude : here the pinning of the charge / bond order is presumably due to impurities and other imperfections in the bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal .",
    "theoretical modeling of the stm spectrum has indicated @xcite that the order is likely to be primarily on bond variables , as may be derived from a spin - peierls state @xcite , _ i.e. _ a _ bond order wave _ @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the prediction of a charge density modulation on the cu sites in the anti - phase domain wall picture of ` stripes ' @xcite , which is not observed @xcite .",
    "hoffman _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also reported related measurements in zero magnetic field , and have focused attention on modulations of the ldos at wavevectors throughout the brillouin zone , and on their dispersion as a function of energy .",
    "they have identified some wavevectors with quasiparticle excitations of the superconductor scattered by random impurities , as suggested in refs.@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss the relationship between the quasiparticle and collective mode contributions to the ldos modulations in a @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "we will use precisely the model proposed earlier by polkovnikov _",
    "@xcite for the pinning of the spin collective mode : we show that the earlier expressions for the induced ldos modulations also contain additional contributions which can be interpreted as those due to quasiparticle scattering , with a spectrum related to observations @xcite .",
    "the relative strength of the collective and quasiparticle contributions can be varied by changing the gap to the spin collective mode : experimentally the gap can be reduced ( and the collective mode contribution enhanced ) by lowering the doping or by applying a magnetic field @xcite , and this should allow a test of our predictions .",
    "some related observations have also been made independently by han @xcite .",
    "our main conclusion is that the ldos modulations observed by stm contain contributions from both the spin collective mode and the quasiparticles : as described in our simple model @xcite , these are relatively independent low energy excitations of the bcs superconductor , but they can become strongly coupled in some sectors of the brillouin zone if permitted by energy and wavevector conservation @xcite ; they should not be viewed as mutually exclusive sources of ldos modulations .",
    "we assume the cuprate superconductor has a dominant spin collective mode near the wavevectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and so write for the spin operator on the lattice site @xmath5 at imaginary time @xmath6 @xmath7 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 are the spin density wave ( sdw ) order parameters which are assumed to be smooth functions of spacetime . as an aside , and for completeness , we mention that charge / bond order parameters can also be constructed out of the @xmath9 .",

    "thus we see from ( [ eq2 ] ) that , as noted earlier , the charge / bond order parameter is proportional to the square of the sdw order parameter . in a similar manner , we will see below that the ldos modulations are also sensitive to the square of the sdw order and so occur at wavevectors @xmath18 : however our computation will include retardation effects missing from a phenomenological correspondence analogous to ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "all our computations below will be in a regime where @xmath19 ( because spin rotation invariance is preserved ) , but we will nevertheless have the rotationally invariant @xmath20 because translational invariance is broken by a pinning potential .",
    "this should be contrasted with the distinct physical pictures of refs .",

    "2 ] : apart from the strong contributions at @xmath76 present in the latter , the former has the same general features as the large @xmath31 cases of the latter .",
    "this is one of the main points of this paper .",
    "the physics of the structure in the static impurity scattering ldos modulation , @xmath77 in ( [ qs ] ) , has already been discussed by wang and lee @xcite .",
    "assuming spatial inversion symmetry , the expression ( [ qs ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath78 this expression is not a convolution of the product of the density of states of quasiparticles at energy @xmath28 with momenta differing by @xmath26 , but rather the product of the density of states of one quasiparticle with the real part of the green function of the other .",
    "it contains weak square - root divergences at special nesting wavevectors @xcite , where constant energy contours with momenta @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) are tangent to each other at one of their the points of contact .",
    "such wavevectors @xmath26 form different lines in the brillouin zone , but these are barely visible in our plots . it has been claimed @xcite that the structure at related wavevectors could be enhanced for strong impurity scattering in a description beyond the born approximation . instead , in fig",
    "4 ] , the main contributions for @xmath26 along the brillouin zone diagonals come from values of @xmath79 and @xmath82 near the nodal points and the underlying fermi surface near @xmath83 respectively .",
    "we emphasize that both these features of quasiparticle - scattering induced ldos modulations also appear in our model @xcite of a pinned dynamic spin collective mode .",
    "in particular , as we noted earlier , if @xmath31 is large , then the pinned sdw model is equivalent to an effective short - range static quasiparticle potential , along with additional weak modulations at @xmath84 ( compare figs  [ fig .",
    "2 ] , and  [ fig .",
    "4 ] ) . for smaller @xmath31 ,",
    "the effective quasiparticle potential created by the sdw fluctuations is dynamic , but the qualitative picture at wavevectors different from @xmath84 remains the same .    in conclusion , we have shown that the model of ref  @xcite displays many of the features observed in recent stm experiments .",
    "besides the modulations of the ldos at wavevectors @xmath85 arising from the spin collective mode , we find other features related to the spectrum of the fermionic bogoliubov quasiparticles ( similar physics is also expected from a possible charge / bond order collective mode ) .",
    "the positions of the maxima at @xmath84 have a relatively small ( but not negligible ) dependence on the tunnelling energy @xmath28 , while other features are more strongly dependent on @xmath28 and the details of the quasiparticle spectrum .",
