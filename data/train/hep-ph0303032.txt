    "weak - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics @xcite .",
    "if it is realized in nature , susy particles will be discovered either at run ii of the fermilab tevatron @xcite or within the first years of running at the cern lhc @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of the susy lagrangian and a precise determination of its free parameters will , however , require the clean environment of a linear @xmath1 collider , where in particular the masses , phases , and ( electroweak ) couplings of sfermions and gauginos will be determined with high accuracy @xcite . however ,",
    "the mass and coupling of the gluino will pose some difficulties , since the gluino couples only to strongly interacting particles and is thus produced only at the one - loop level or in multi - parton final states .    in a recent publication",
    ", we have investigated gluino pair production through triangular quark / squark loops in @xmath1 annihilation with center - of - mass energies up to 3 tev , which may become available in the future at linear colliders like desy tesla or cern clic @xcite .",
    "due to large cancellation effects , we found that promisingly large cross sections can only be expected for scenarios with large left-/right - handed up - type squark mass splittings or with large top - squark mixing and for gluino masses up to 500 gev .",
    "small gluino masses of 200 gev might be measured with a precision of about 5 gev in center - of - mass energy scans with luminosities of 100 fb@xmath2/point . however , when both the left-/right - handed squark mass splitting and the squark mixing remain small , gluino pair production in @xmath1 annihilation will be hard to observe , even with luminosities of 1000 fb@xmath2/year .    in this paper , we study the potential of high - energy photon colliders for the production of gluino pairs within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "similar studies have previously been carried out for the production of sm @xcite , mssm @xcite , and double - charged higgs bosons @xcite , sfermion pairs @xcite , and various other processes @xcite . in the mssm , the process @xmath0 is mediated by quark / squark box diagrams with enhancements for up - type quarks / squarks from their larger charges and for third generation squarks from their large mass splittings , generated by the mixing of left- and right - handed states . at tree level , gluinos can be produced in pairs only in association with two quarks , or they are produced singly in association with a quark and a squark .",
    "both processes result in multi - jet final states , where phase space is limited and gluinos may be hard to isolate . far above threshold and in scenarios with very heavy squarks , resolved photons",
    "can contribute significantly at tree level .",
    "taking into account the usual laser photon backscattering spectrum @xcite , electron and laser beam polarization effects , and current mass exclusion limits , we find that gluino pair production in high - energy photon collisions should be visible over large regions of the mssm parameter space , contrary to what has been found for @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "in addition , the cross section rises rather steeply , so that a gluino mass determination with a precision of a few gev should be feasible for a wide range of post - lep benchmark points .",
    "our calculations involve various masses and couplings of sm particles , for which we use the most up - to - date values from the 2002 review of the particle data group @xcite .",
    "in particular , we evaluate the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath3 at the mass of the @xmath4-boson , @xmath5 gev , and calculate the weak mixing angle @xmath6 from the tree - level expression @xmath7 with @xmath8 gev . among the quark masses ,",
    "only the one of the top quark , @xmath9 gev , plays a significant role , while the bottom quark mass , @xmath10 gev , and the charm quark mass , @xmath11 gev , could have been neglected like those of the three light quarks .",
    "the strong coupling constant is evaluated at the gluino mass scale from the one - loop expression with five active flavors and @xmath12 mev , corresponding to the world avarage ( available only at two loops ) of @xmath13 .",
    "a variation of the renormalization scale by a factor of four about the gluino mass results in a cross section uncertainty of about @xmath14 % , which can be reduced considerably by including full next - to - leading order qcd corrections . like the heavy top quark ,",
    "all susy particles have been decoupled from the running of the strong coupling constant .",
    "we work in the framework of the mssm with conserved @xmath15- ( matter- ) parity , which represents the simplest phenomenologically viable model , but which is still sufficiently general to not depend on a specific susy breaking mechanism .",
    "models with broken @xmath15-parity are severely restricted by the non - observation of proton decay , which would violate both baryon and lepton number conservation .",
    "we do not consider light gluino mass windows , which may or may not be excluded from searches at fixed target and collider experiments @xcite .",
    "instead , we adopt the current mass limit @xmath16 gev from the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite searches in the jets with missing energy channel , relevant for non - mixing squark masses of @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 .",
    "values for the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath19 , below 2.4 are already excluded by the cern lep experiments , although this value is obtained using one - loop corrections only and depends in addition on the top quark mass .",
    "furthermore , values of @xmath19 between 2.4 and 8.5 are only allowed in a very narrow window of light higgs boson masses between 113 and 127 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , we employ a safely high value of @xmath20 . if not stated otherwise , we adopt the smallest allowed universal squark mass of @xmath21 gev and large top - squark mixing with @xmath22 , @xmath23 gev , and @xmath24 gev , which can be generated by choosing appropriate values for the higgs mass parameter , @xmath25 gev , and the trilinear top - squark coupling , @xmath26 gev @xcite .",
    "the susy one - loop contributions to the @xmath27-parameter and the light top - squark mass @xmath28 are then still significantly below and above the cern lep limits , @xmath29 and @xmath30 gev @xcite . for small and intermediate values of @xmath19 ,",
    "mixing in the bottom squark sector remains small , and we take @xmath31 as for the four light squark flavors .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we compute the one - loop amplitudes for gluino pair production in direct photon - photon collisions , discuss briefly their analytical properties , and study in detail their numerical dependence on the squark masses and mixing angles , on the photon polarization and center - of - mass energy . in sec.[sec:3 ] we calculate the squared matrix elements for the resolved photon contributions from quark - antiquark and gluon - gluon scattering analytically and discuss several typical cases , where resolved processes can be numerically important . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we present expected total cross sections for gluino pair production with laser - backscattered photons in polarized electron - electron collisions for various post - lep benchmark susy scenarios .",
    "we then estimate the precision with which the gluino mass might be determined for various typical squark and gluino masses and realistic photon collider luminosities .",

    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "as the supersymmetric partners of the gauge bosons of the strong interaction , gluinos couple only to colored particles and sparticles and can therefore not be pair - produced directly at tree - level in photon - photon collisions .",

    "figure [ fig:13 ] shows the threshold behavior of the direct ( dashed curves ) ,    quark - antiquark ( dotted curves ) , and gluon - gluon initiated cross sections ( dot - dashed curves ) for small ( top ) and large ( bottom ) values of @xmath59 . in the first scenario ,",
    "the direct channel dominates at threshold as expected , while in the second case it is completely negligible in the entire center - of - mass energy range .",
    "instead , the threshold behavior of the total cross section is dominated by the quark - antiquark channel , and the gluon - gluon process contributes significantly at larger values of @xmath89 .",
    "resolved contributions are therefore only important ( 1 ) if @xmath90 , _ i.e. _ far above the gluino pair production threshold , or ( 2 ) if @xmath91 .",
    "the first case is of little practical importance .",
    "for @xmath92 , it would in fact be desirable to suppress the resolved contributions so that the photon - photon center - of - mass energy is fully available in threshold scans .",
    "this should be feasible by reconstructing the observed momentum fractions of the partons in the photon from the gluino pair and requiring them to be large .",
    "the second case is more interesting and may allow for a gluino mass determination in scenarios that would be unobservable in @xmath1 or direct @xmath93 collisions .",
    "in practice , high - energy photon collisions will become feasible through the backscattering of laser photons from electron beams at future linear colliders .",
    "the unpolarized and polarized laser backscattering spectra are @xcite f_/e(x ) & = & \\{1-x + -+ .",
    "- 2 _ e p_c } and f_/e(x ) & = & \\ { 2 _ e .",
    "+ & & .+ p_c ( 1- ) ( 1-x+ ) } , where n_c = ( 1+x)+ + - + and n_c= are related to the total compton cross section and @xmath94 is the mean helicity of the backscattered photon @xmath48 .",
    "the photon spectra depend on the center - of - mass energy of the electron - laser photon collision @xmath95 through the parameter @xmath96 , whose optimal value is determined by the threshold for @xmath1 pair production . in the strong fields of the laser waves , the electrons ( or high - energy photons )",
    "can interact simultaneously with several laser photons , so that the optimal value of @xmath97 increases from @xmath98 to @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "if the parameter @xmath97 is kept fixed , the laser backscattering spectra become independent of the electron beam energy . a large fraction of the photons is then produced close to the kinematic limit @xmath100 .",
    "the monochromaticity of the produced photons can be improved further by choosing the helicity of the 100% polarized laser photons opposite to that of the 80% polarized electrons .",
    "since the low - energy tail of the photon spectrum is neither useful nor well understood , we use only the high - energy peak with @xmath101 and normalize our cross sections such that the expected number of events can be obtained through simple multiplication with the envisaged photon - photon luminosity of 100 - 200 fb@xmath2/year .",
    "this requires reconstruction of the total final - state energy , which may be difficult due to the missing energy carried away by the ( typically two ) escaping lightest susy particles ( lsps ) . however , high - energy photon collisions allow for cuts on the relative longitudinal energy in addition to the missing-@xmath102 plus multi - jet , top or bottom quark , and/or like - sign lepton analyses performed at hadron colliders , and sufficiently long - lived gluinos can be identified by their typical @xmath15-hadron signatures .",
    "the total cross section for gluino pair production in polarized electron - electron collisions is given by _",
    "ee & = & x_1 f_/e(x_1 ) x_2 f_/e(x_2 ) + & & ( 1+_1)(1+_2 ) + 12(1+_1)(1-_2 ) + & + & ( 1-_1)(1+_2 ) + 12(1-_1)(1-_2 ) , where parity conservation in ( susy-)qcd guarantees that @xmath103 and @xmath104 . for resolved processes ,",
    "the photon densities are replaced by parton densities in the electron , f_a",
    "/ e(x , m^2 ) = _ x^1 f_/e ( ) f_a/ ( y , m^2 ) and f_a / e(x , m^2 ) = _ x^1 f_/e ( ) f_a/ ( y , m^2 ) .    in fig .  [ fig:3 ] we show that gluino pair production in direct    @xmath93 collisions decreases with the universal squark mass @xmath59 , but depends only weakly on the top - squark mixing .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the results obtained in @xmath1 annihilation @xcite . in this plot , the @xmath105 center - of - mass energy",
    "is chosen close to the threshold for gluino pair production ( @xmath106 ) and is varied simultaneously with @xmath45 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] are several post - lep susy benchmark points , which have recently been proposed within the framework of the constrained mssm @xcite .",
    "studies similar to those performed in fig.[fig:2 ] show that with the exception of point e , where only about ten events per year are to be expected , the gluino mass can be dermined with a precision of @xmath107 gev ( point j ) or better .    for gluino masses between 200 and 500 gev ,",
    "the total cross section for gluino pair production in polarized electron - electron collisions with laser - backscattered photons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] as a function    of the electron - electron center - of - mass energy @xmath108 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 annihilation cross section stays below 0.1 fb and falls steeply with @xmath45 , so that gluino pair production will be unobservable for @xmath109 gev irrespective of the collider energy @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath93 cross section reaches several fb for a wide range of @xmath45 . in @xmath1 annihilation",
    "the gluinos are produced as a @xmath69-wave and the cross section rises rather slowly , whereas in @xmath93 collisions they can be produced as an @xmath68-wave and the cross section rises much faster .",
    "this is particularly true for identical helicities of the initial photons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] ) .",
    "the steep threshold behavior can be observed even more clearly in fig.[fig:2 ] , where the sensitivity of a photon collider to the gluino mass    is investigated .",
    "for the cern lhc experiments , a precision of @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) gev is expected for gluino masses of 540 ( 1004 ) gev @xcite . if the masses and mixing angle(s ) of the top ( and bottom ) squarks",
    "are known , a statistical precision of @xmath112 gev can be achieved in @xmath1 annihilation for @xmath113 gev for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath2 per center - of - mass energy point @xcite .",
    "a precision of @xmath114 gev may be obtained at a tev - scale photon collider for @xmath115 gev and an integrated photon - photon luminosity of 50 fb@xmath2 per point , provided that the total final - state energy can be sufficiently well reconstructed .",
    "of course , uncertainties from a realistic photon spectrum and the detector simulation add to the statistical error .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] we demonstrate that even in scenarios with a very large    squark mass parameter @xmath116 gev and no squark mixing a gluino mass of @xmath113 gev could be determined with a precision of @xmath112 gev .",
    "the cross section is then dominated by the quark - initiated resolved contributions ( see the lower plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] ) .",
    "the shaded band indicates the uncertainty from a variation of parton densities in the photon from grv lo @xcite to sas 1d and 1 m @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be fairly small , since the quark densities at large @xmath117 are well constrained from photon structure function data @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , the reconstruction of the susy lagrangian and the precise determination of its free parameters are among the paramount objectives of any future linear @xmath1 collider .",
    "determination of the gluino mass and coupling will , however , be difficult , since the gluino couples only strongly and its pair production cross section in @xmath1 annihilation suffers from large cancellations in the triangular quark / squark loop diagrams . a photon collider may therefore be the only way to obtain precise gluino mass determinations and visible gluino pair production cross sections for general squark masses and would thus strongly complement the physics program feasible in @xmath1 annihilation . for recently proposed typical post - lep susy benchmark points , gluino pairs",
    "can be produced from laser - backscattered photons with cross sections between 0.1 fb and 4 fb , so that a gluino mass of 540 ( 1670 ) gev may be determined with a precision of @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) gev or better .",
