    "grb are cosmic gamma ray emission distributed isotropically originating at extra galactic distances .",
    "they are inferred to have energy of the order of @xmath0 ergs .",
    "if the beaming and the @xmath1-ray production of the grb are quite high , then the central engine which powers such conversion can release energy to power grb at cosmological distances .",
    "there are various models describing the central engine for grb .",
    "mergers of two ns or a ns and a black hole in a binary @xcite being some popular models .",
    "however , recent calculation of janka & ruffert @xcite had shown that the energy released in such neutrino - antineutrino annihilation is much smaller to account for the grb , thought to be occurring at large cosmological distances .",
    "therefore , the central engine which powers such huge energies in grb still remains unclear .",
    "on the other hand , the conversion of a ns to a qs liberates huge amount of energy , simply because the star mass changes during the conversion .",
    "therefore , the mass difference of ns and qs manifest itself in the form of energy release .",
    "the first calculation of the energy release by such conversion was proposed by alcock et al .",
    "@xcite and olinto @xcite .",
    "more detailed similar calculation for the conversion of ns to ss / hs was done by cheng & dai @xcite , ma & xie @xcite and subsequently by many others @xcite .",
    "almost all of them found the energy released to be greater than @xmath2ergs , and connected them with the observed gamma ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "however , new observation @xcite reveals the grb to occur at cosmological distances .",
    "therefore , energies of the order of @xmath2 ergs are too low to power grb at such huge distances . a systematic calculation done by bombaci & datta @xcite , using various eos , estimated the energy released during conversion to be of the order of @xmath0ergs .",
    "their main assumption was that the initial ns baryonic mass ( bm ) and the final ns bm is the same , the bm is conserved during such conversion .",
    "their estimation of the energy release can power grb to such large distances and was in agreement with the observed grb .",
    "however , during the conversion there can be ejection of matter from the outer layers of the star due to several shock bounce .",
    "the matter ejected is usually assumed to be low , but fryer & woosley @xcite showed that the matter ejected can be as high as @xmath3 solar mass .",
    "for such a scenario the assumption of baryonic mass conservation does no longer hold .",
    "the above calculation of energy release depends on the fact that some of the compact stars are really exotic and quark stars ( qs either ss or hs ) do really exist . however , the recent measurement @xcite found the pulsars to have a very high mass , @xmath4m@xmath5 .",
    "pulsars with such high masses , for the first time , has imposed strict constraints in determining the equations of state ( eos ) of matter describing compact stars .",
    "the eos of quark matter usually has strangeness @xcite and therefore , provides an additional degree of freedom .",
    "this extra degree of freedom softens the eos , that is , the reduction of pressure for a given energy density . as a result",
    ", it becomes difficult for the quark eos to generate stars with such high mass which satisfies the mass limit set by new measured heavy pulsars .",
    "however , new calculations have found that the effects due to strong interaction , such as one - gluon exchange or color - superconductivity can make the eos stiffer and increase the maximum mass limit of ss and hs @xcite .",
    "ozel @xcite and lattimer @xcite were the first to study the implications of the new mass limit for ss and hs within the mit bag model .",
    "therefore , the conversion of ns to qs ( ss / hs ) is still a viable scenario of astrophysical phase transition ( pt ) .    the only other astrophysical events which can come close to the energy budget of grb are the recently observed giant flares .",
    "three giant flares , sgr 0526 - 66 , sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite have been detected so far . the huge amount of energy in these flares can be explained by the presence of a strong surface magnetic field , whose strength is estimated to be larger than @xmath6 g , and such stars are termed magnetars .",
    "simple calculation suggests that the magnetic fields in the star interior can be few order higher ( @xmath7 g ) .",
    "theoretical calculation also suggests that such strong magnetic field can effects the gross structure of ns .",
    "it effects the structure of a ns through the metric describing the star @xcite or by modifying the eos of the matter through the landau quantization of charged particles @xcite .",
    "as the eos gets modified , the mass of magnetar differs from a normal pulsar .",
    "this would eventually effect the energy released during the conversion of a nm to quark magnetar ( qm ) .",
    "therefore , the energy released during the pt of normal pulsars would be quite different from the energy released during the pt of magnetars .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the energy release during the conversion of ns to ss / hs . previous",
    "calculation does not include the idea of matter ejection during the conversion process . in our calculation",
    "we assume that the baryonic mass conservation to be true , only after taking into account the mass of the matter ejected .",
    "finally , we would study the energy released during the conversion of a nm to sm / hm . in the next section ( section ii )",
    ", we give the outline of the calculations involved in the energy release . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the eos .",
    "we discuss the effect of magnetic field on the eos in section iv , and the hs is discussed in section v. the results are discussed in section vi .",
    "finally , in section vii , we summarize our results and draw conclusion from them .",
    "earlier calculation of the energy release during the phase transition of a ns to qs was based on the idea that the baryon number is conserved during the phase transition , therefore , the baryonic mass of the star remains same after the conversion .",
    "however , there is a change in the proper mass and the gravitational mass .",
    "the energy released during the conversion is primarily due to the difference in the proper and gravitational mass of initial ns and final qs .",
    "however , fryer & woosley @xcite showed that there may be ejection of matter during the conversion from the outer layer of the star due to several shock bounce .",
    "their calculation showed that the matter ejected can be as high as @xmath3 solar mass , where the baryon number conservation is not maintained . in this work",
    "we assume that as the pt occurs and the transition front travels outwards converting hadronic matter to quark matter . during the pt",
    "the star suffers several shock bounce and matter is ejected primarily from the outer layers of the ns .",
    "matter is ejected before the phase transition front reaches the outer layers .",
    "therefore , the matter ejected is normal hadronic matter .",
    "what happens is that , say the phase transition starts in a ns of baryonic mass @xmath8 solar mass .",
    "the phase transition front starts travelling outwards , towards the surface of the ns , converting hadronic matter to quark matter . during this time",
    "several shock bounces happens and matter is ejected from the outer layers of the star .",
    "the ejected matter is still hadronic matter ( mostly from the outer nuclear region ) .",
    "we assume the matter ejected is of baryonic mass @xmath3 solar mass .",
    "therefore , the baryonic mass of the ns is now @xmath9 solar mass .",
    "the baryonic mass of the final qs is also @xmath9 solar mass .",
    "the energy released during the conversion is due to the difference in the proper and gravitational mass of the intermediate ns and final qs ( which have the same baryonic mass of @xmath9 solar mass ) .",
    "the matter ejected does not play any role in the energy release because it is ejected from the star before suffers any phase transition .",
    "the total energy released in the conversion of ns to qs is actually the difference between the total binding energy of the qs star ( be(qs ) ) and the total binding energy of the ns ( be(ns ) ) @xmath10 the total conversion energy can then be written as the sum of gravitational and internal energy change @xmath11 where the gravitational and internal energy are given by @xmath12    the total , internal and gravitational energy of conversion can be written in terms of their respective gravitational and proper mass ( or rest mass ) @xmath13c^2 , \\\\",

    "the gibbs condition determines the mechanical and chemical equilibrium between two phases , and is given by @xcite @xmath59 the volume fraction occupied by quark matter in the mixed phase is @xmath60 , and the hadronic matter is @xmath61 and is connected as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is respective charge density .",

    "this assumption may not be valid for every scenario as there may be some matter ejection from the star .",
    "for the phase transition induced collapse of ns to qs , there may be a shock development at the centre of the star which gives enough momentum for the matter to eject from the outer layers of the star @xcite .",
    "it was suggested by fryer & woosley @xcite that the mass ejection may be as high as @xmath3 times solar mass .",
    "recent calculation also shows that the phase transition ( only deconfinement ) in the ns can proceed via a deflagration or a detonation @xcite with such high velocities that the whole star is converted to two flavor quark matter within a few millisecond . for such cases",
    "the velocity is so high that there ought to be some matter ejection from the outer layers .",
    "if such is the case , the baryon mass conservation condition can not be maintained strictly .",
    "we assume that the matter is ejected before the phase transition front reaches the outer layers .",
    "therefore , the ejected matter is normal hadronic matter and not quark matter .",

    "@xcite argued that due to the difference of gravitational binding energy of the star after the phase transition some matter near the stellar surface would be ejected .",

    "the mass ejection could give rise to high lorentz factor and also high luminosity needed for grb .",
    "we should mention that the eos which was used for the calculation are softer due to the presence of strangeness ( hyperons in hadronic eos and strange quarks in quark eos ) in them .",

    "this is due to the presence of extra term coming from consideration of density dependent bag constant ( eq .",
    "the eos of quark sector is still much debated and new model ( njl and pnjl ) are being used to satisfy the strong interacting behaviour .",

    "even with such consideration , the hadronic eos is still the steepest and the quark eos is the softest .",

    "the total energy released is the sum of the gravitational and internal energy of conversion .",
    "our first assumption was that the conversion starts with a sudden spin down of the star , resulting in a huge density fluctuation at the core , initiating the phase transition .",

    ", the energy liberated is obtained from the difference in the gravitational mass of the initial ns and final qs .",
    "for such a case the liberated energy is always close to @xmath0 ergs .",
    "next , we had shown the energy liberated during the conversion of ns to qs , with matter ejection from the surface layer of the ns . the amount of matter ejected is taken to be @xmath95 of @xmath96 .",

    "the energy liberated during the conversion of ns to qs with matter ejection is always less than that of the energy liberated during the conversion of ns to qs with no matter ejection .",
    "we have also studied the conversion of ns to ss / hs having high surface magnetic field ( observed magnetars ) .",
    "we have denoted them as nm and qm ( sm / hm ) . the energy liberated during the conversion of magnetars is less than that for normal pulsars .",

    "however , the magnetars would release energy more efficiently from their magnetic poles than the normal ns .",
    "therefore , in magnetars the energy liberated from the star with large lorentz number and can account for the giant flares activity .",

    "the amount of matter ejected , the fraction of energy which goes towards heating of the star and the fraction spent on maintaining the conversion would ultimately determine the fate of energy release .",
    "however , if a significant amount of energy released goes into the energetic of electron - positron pairs production , it can account for the grb energy .    assuming the baryonic mass of the star to remain unaltered",
    ", bombaci and dutta @xcite performed their calculation and found that the ns has always greater mass than the final ss .",
    "neutrino - antineutrino pair annihilation to electron - positron pairs deposit energy of the order of @xmath99ergs @xcite .",
    "neutron proton scattering by neutrinos inside the dense star deposit energy at least two to three order further higher . due to the shock of the phase transition some matter near the stellar surface",
    "may be ejected and would further be accelerated by electron - positron pairs and may eventually oscillate .",
    "this may give rise to high lorentz factor and high luminosity needed for grb .",
    "these two are the most efficient processes to account for the energetic of the grb .",
    "as the actual process takes place at cosmological distances , we do not have a better understanding of such phenomena .",
    "as there are no other source of external energy available to the star , other than the rotational energy , a huge amount of energy may be used in the actual conversion .",
    "we can only conclude that if a small fraction of the energy of the conversion is released it may manifest itself at least in the form of giant flares , which are usually associated with the magnetars .",
    "however , if a substantial amount of energy is released , it may account for the energies observed during the grb .",
    "therefore , more detailed studies in theoretical and observational front is still needed for the pulsars and magnetars to have a better understanding of the energetic of the conversion .",
    "on the other hand , with new observation of @xmath8 solar mass pulsar gives very strong constraints for the eos describing compact stars .",
    "the eos used in our calculation can not satisfy the new mass limit .",
    "however , this can be remedied by considering new prescriptions for both hadronic and quark matter eos . with the improved eos",
    ", the basic results of our calculation does not have any qualitative change but only small quantitative change . with new techniques of precise mass measurement ,",
    "the physics of pulsars is entering a new phase . as the exact nature of strong interactions",
    "is still far from being settled , the quark eos being very model dependent , the maximum mass of ns and qs calculated from theoretical consideration are going to evolve further in future . to get a clear picture of energy release and its detailed mechanism we need more detailed microscopic studies and",
    "this work is the first step towards that direction .",

    "<S> the phase transition from normal hadronic matter to quark matter in neutron stars ( ns ) could give rise to several interesting phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> compact stars can have such exotic states up to their surface ( called strange stars ( ss ) ) or they can have quark core surrounded by hadronic matter , known as hybrid stars ( hs ) . as the state of matter of the resultant ss / hs is different from the initial hadronic matter , their masses also differ . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , such conversion leads to huge energy release , sometimes of the order of @xmath0 ergs . in the present work we study the qualitative energy released by such conversion . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations reveal huge surface magnetic field in certain stars , termed magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> such huge magnetic fields can modify the equations of state ( eos ) of the matter describing the star . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the mass of magnetars are different from normal ns . </S>",
    "<S> the energy released during the conversion process from neutron magnetar ( nm ) to strange magnetar / hybrid magnetar ( ss / hs ) is different from normal ns to ss / hs conversion . in this work we calculate the energy release during the phase transition in magnetars . the energy released during ns to ss / hs conversion exceeds the energy released during nm to sm / hm conversion . the energy released during the conversion of ns </S>",
    "<S> to ss is always of the order of @xmath0 ergs . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of energy released during such conversion can only be compared to the energy observed during the gamma ray bursts ( grb ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy liberated during nm to hm conversion is few times lesser , and is not likely to power grb at cosmological distances . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnetars are more likely to lose their energy from the magnetic poles and can produce giant flares , which are usually associated with magnetars .    </S>",
