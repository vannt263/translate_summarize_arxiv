    "fullerenes and cubane have recently been shown to form so called rotor - stator cocrystals.@xcite these cocrystals are different from both orientationally ordered and plastic crystals , as one of their constituents ( the fullerene ) is rotating and the other one ( the cubane ) is fixed in a well - defined orientation . in the case of  rotating 60  molecules",

    "crystallizes in a face - centered cubic structure above 375  k.@xcite at room temperature the rotation of  is somewhat restricted , which leads to a tetragonal distortion ; the  molecule is able to rotate around its main axis which , in turn , precesses around the crystallographic @xmath2 axis . the formation of these structures is driven by the molecular recognition between the concave surface of the cubane and the round surface of the fullerenes.@xcite    on heating the fullerene - cubane compounds undergo a topochemical reaction.@xcite as the reaction product is insoluble in common solvents , it is most likely a copolymer of the fullerene with cubane.@xcite x - ray diffraction patterns of the annealed samples , measured at room temperature , show a large emerging amorphous part and weakening reflections compatible with fcc structure . compared to the original monomer phase the shift of these reflections indicates lattice expansion and their intensity quickly vanishes at high angles . because of the parallel appearance of the amorphous contribution and disappearance of crystallinity we can assume that the amorphous phase retains the local cubic order . another observation which makes this assumption reasonable is that the morphology of the crystals does not change on heating.@xcite    in this paper we present a detailed vibrational ( infrared and raman ) characterization of the monomer and polymer phases of  and . in the monomer phases , we can confirm the rotor - stator nature of the materials .",
    "based on the spectra of the polymer phases , we deduce the symmetry of the majority of the fullerene units as d@xmath1 , similar to the linear cycloaddition polymers .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with a substantial presence of linear segments in the copolymer .",
    "we published the infrared spectra of the monomer and polymer phases of  and  earlier as supplementary material to ref .",
    "a thorough study of polymerization of  at high temperature and high pressure has been performed by iwasiewicz - wabnig _ et al._,@xcite using x - ray diffraction and raman spectroscopy .",
    "our results , obtained at ambient pressure on annealing , are complementary to that study , except that we observe a photopolymerization reaction on illumination with green or blue light , which accounts for the laser wavelength dependence of the raman spectra .",
    "cubane was prepared following the method of eaton and cole.@xcite cubane and the fullerenes c@xmath0 and c@xmath3 were coprecipitated from toluene by adding isopropyl alcohol or by evaporating the solvent to form c@xmath4c@xmath5h@xmath5 and c@xmath6c@xmath5h@xmath5.@xcite    the resulting black powder was pressed into kbr pellets for infrared ( ir ) measurements .",
    "the spectra were recorded by a bruker ifs28 and a bruker ifs 66v / s spectrometer .",
    "depending on the width of the lines to be observed , the resolution was set between 2 and 0.25 @xmath7 .",
    "temperature - dependent measurements were conducted in a flow cryostat cooled by liquid nitrogen or helium with the temperature adjustable between 20 and 600  k. the kbr pellet technique has the disadvantage that the index of refraction of the samples is generally in mismatch with that of the medium , therefore the lineshapes become asymmetric ( christiansen effect ) . however , the alternative of using organic oils as nujol was discarded because we wanted to identify as many new infrared lines as possible , without disturbing absorption from the medium .",
    "raman microscopy data were acquired in backscattering geometry on powder samples either under ambient conditions or in an evacuated glass capillary .",
    "spectra were taken with three lines ( 468  nm , 531  nm and 676  nm ) of a kr - ion laser on a triple monochromator ( jobin - yvon t64000 ) .",

    "we label these by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the raman spectra taken with the 785  nm laser line of a diode laser were collected by a renishaw 1000 mb raman spectrometer .",

    "[ fig : c60ram ] ) , because we approach resonant scattering in the fullerenes.@xcite    60 belongs to the icosahedral ( @xmath18 ) point group and consequently shows four infrared - active vibrational modes with 1u  symmetry .",
    "out of its ten raman - active modes , two belong to the  and eight to the  irreducible representation .",

    "the ir modes can be decomposed as 21  @xmath20 + 10  @xmath21 , and the raman modes as 12  @xmath22 + 22  @xmath23 + 19  @xmath24 . similarly to the case of pristine , not all of these modes have sufficient intensity to be easily detected .",
    "@xcite cubane belongs to the octahedral ( @xmath17 ) point group .",
    "its three infrared - active 1umodes are clearly visible in the spectra of the  and  rotor - stator cocrystals .",
    "this cubane spectrum is indeed the closest to that of isolated cubane in a crystalline environment ; solid cubane@xcite shows a more complicated spectrum because of the lower site symmetry .",
    "the eight raman - active modes of cubane are classified as 2  @xmath25 + 2  @xmath26 + 4  @xmath27 . only three out of these eight appear in the  spectrum taken with the 785  nm laser and none in the spectra taken with the 531  nm laser , because of the aforementioned cross - section differences .    in the  cocrystal , the depolarization ratio @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 the oscillator strength of an excitation at either @xmath16 or @xmath15 polarization ;",
    "see section 2 ) should be zero for the fullerene  modes and @xmath30 for the  modes .",
    "the  modes were indeed found totally polarized , and the depolarization ratio was 0.90 for the ( 1 ) and 0.71 for the ( 4 ) mode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : c60ram ] ) .",
    "in contrast the totally symmetric modes of  should not vanish completely in the @xmath16 geometry because of its @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "this is what is found in the  cocrystal .",
    "the modes that have lower depolarization ratios are labeled by a in fig .",
    "[ fig : c70ram ] .",
    "these modes correspond to the ones assigned to @xmath22 by sun and kertsz .",
    "@xcite    in contrast to the fullerenes , the frequencies of the cubane principal lines in the rotor - stator crystals deviate from those of cubane in its pure solid form .",
    "@xcite if we compare the vibrational frequencies for various environments of the cubane molecule , a clear trend can be observed .",
    "the highest vibrational frequencies occur in the gas phase.@xcite in pure solid cubane or in solution the lines shift to lower frequencies .",
    "further downshift is found in  and finally in .",
    "this trend is similar to that found in the vibrational frequencies of molecules trapped in rare gas matrices @xcite and is caused by van der waals interaction : the higher the polarizability of the environment , the lower the frequency .",
    "the relatively large shifts in the solids reflect the high polarizability of the fullerenes .      the spectra of  change dramatically upon annealing to 470  k either in a furnace or in a heated cryostat in the ir spectrometer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cc60heating ] ) .",

    "[ fig : c60ram ] and [ fig : cc60heating ] , and the peak positions listed in table [ table : c60r ] and [ table : c60ir ] , respectively . upon heating to 470  k an irreversible reaction takes place . when annealing a few tens of mg sample in the furnace , the first changes in the ir spectra appear after 40 minutes : 60  modes split and new modes appear .",
    "further annealing leads to the disappearance of the original 60  and cubane modes and increased intensity of the new peaks .",
    "the new features of the final reaction product in the ir spectrum are the same , irrespective of whether the annealing was done in a furnace or _ in situ _ in a cryostat .    in the raman spectrum of the annealed  the  modes of 60 do not split , but the low energy , i.e. radial  modes show at least a threefold splitting , best seen on the lone - standing ( 1 ) mode . in the ir spectrum the original 1u modes of the fullerene split into at least two lines , and new peaks appear between 700 and 800 -1 . the splitting and",
    "the new modes indicate that the 60  molecule is distorted . however , the number of new lines is considerably less than would be expected if the cage opened.@xcite in contrast , the change in the cubane lines is striking .",
    "the original lines disappear completely , only a weak ir line at 2948 -1  indicates that there are still hydrocarbon groups in the sample .",
    "we infer from the position of this line , which corresponds to the c - h stretching in saturated hydrocarbons , that the carbon atoms involved are sp@xmath31 hybridized . in the reaction",
    ", we have to account for all atoms since no mass loss was observed by thermogravimetry - mass spectrometry ( tg - ms ) up to 570 k.@xcite this suggests that the cubane transforms into a different constitutional isomer and covalently bonds to 60 , leading to a structural distortion .",
    "the reaction product is most probably a covalently bound copolymer , as the products are insoluble in common solvents .",
    "pristine cubane also isomerizes at 470  k,@xcite the same temperature where the polymerization appears in .",
    "hence , a straightforward assumption is that the first step of the copolymerization reaction must be the decomposition of cubane .",
    "pristine cubane can decompose into several products , e.g. cyclooctatetraene , bicyclooctatriene , styrene and dihydropentalene.@xcite as the first three form known adducts with 60,@xcite which we could not detect by either ir spectroscopy or hplc@xcite , we can exclude these as being the connecting units between the fullerenes .    in principle",
    "both fullerene - fullerene and fullerene-  bonds can be realized in the polymer .",
    "-  bonds can be excluded , as the c@xmath5h@xmath5 molecules are well separated by the fullerene molecules .",
    "we can also exclude the possibility of covalent fullerene - fullerene bonding because of the following experimental observations .",
    "there are two known bond types between fullerene molecules in fullerene homopolymers . in neutral polymers the [ 2 + 2 ] cycloaddition leads to a cyclobutane - type ring with two single bonds between the buckyballs .",
    "@xcite a raman peak at approximately 950 -1  is associated with this bond .",
    "@xcite this peak is absent in the spectrum of .",
    "the other possible bond type is one single bond between two fullerene molecules .",
    "@xcite this bond leads to the appearance of a characteristic ir peak between 800 - 850 -1 . as this peak",
    "is also absent we can rule out the fullerene - fullerene direct bond .",
    "there is still another observation which confirms this assumption . in fullerene polymers @xcite and in the dimer - oxide c@xmath32o",
    "@xcite interball vibrational peaks appear in the raman spectrum between 100 - 140 -1 .",
    "we measured the raman spectrum down to 20 -1 , but did not find any peaks below the split ( 1 ) mode .",
    "the reason for the absence of the interfullerene bonding comes from structural considerations .",
    "the large interfullerene distance observed by x - ray diffraction @xcite does not allow the 60  molecules to approach each other close enough for a reaction to occur between them .",
    "in the following we try to establish the connection pattern of the fullerene unit based on the infrared and raman spectra . since the ir and raman spectra retain mutual exclusion ( no lines",
    "are observed to appear simultaneously in both ) , the inversion center of the c@xmath0 balls must be preserved .",
    "this means that the possible point groups of the 60  molecules are : @xmath18 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 . in table",
    "[ table : correl ] we show the evolution and splitting of the raman active  and  and the ir active 1u  modes caused by symmetry reduction from i@xmath40 to these point groups ( correlation table ) .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 point groups can be ruled out because the expected number of additionally activated peaks@xcite is too high to be reconciled with the observed data .",
    "a @xmath37 distortion could in principle be positively identified as it leads to a threefold splitting of the 1u modes , in contrast to the others ; unfortunately , in this case our fits were not sufficiently robust to distinguish between a three- or twofold splitting .",
    "@xmath18 or @xmath33 symmetry would not cause splittings , therefore these can not be the only point groups appearing ; there must be units of reduced symmetry even if the connection pattern of the fullerene units is not uniform throughout the whole polymer .    to draw the possible structures with the appropriate point groups we recall our assumption based on structural data@xcite that the local arrangement of the molecules does not change significantly on polymerization ; thus the fullerenes must still be surrounded octahedrally by cubanes .",
    "in addition , on polymerization the inversion center of the 60molecule can be retained only if it is connected to an even number of c@xmath5h@xmath5 molecules .",
    "the connection patterns selected by this condition from the set of possible point groups are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] .",
    "this subset contains @xmath41 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "three types of fullerene-  connections appear in the possible structures . in the first case ( pattern @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] ) the -fullerene connection involves two adjacent carbon atoms on the double bond of the 60  molecule connecting two hexagons , just as in the case of the high - pressure high - temperature ( hpht ) 60  polymers.@xcite the difference is that while in those polymers a cyclobutane ring is formed on polymerization , here both a four - center ( cyclobutane ) and a three - center ( cyclopropane ) ring is possible .",
    "the second type of fullerene-  connection ( pattern @xmath2 and @xmath44 in the third column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] . ) is formed again by two atoms of 60 , but these lie on pentagon - hexagon bonds .",
    "it has been shown that such a connection pattern can only exist if the ball is opened.@xcite as an opening was excluded based on ir results , pattern @xmath2 and @xmath44 can be eliminated .",
    "the last type of connection between a fullerene and a  is a single bond ( pattern @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the fourth column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] ) .",
    "next we subject these remaining structures to closer scrutiny .",
    "pattern @xmath47 was observed in the linear orthorhombic 60  polymer , and @xmath48 in the two - dimensional tetragonal polymer.@xcite in these polymers and in the 60  dimer an empirical relation holds between the shift of the ( 2 ) mode and the number of bonds on a single 60  ball : the shift is 5  -1  for every cycloaddition connection ( i.e. two adjacent single bonds).@xcite the softening occurs because the bonds formed in the polymerization reaction originate from the @xmath49-bonds of the fullerene .",
    "the shift of 10  -1  in  fits perfectly to pattern @xmath47 .",
    "as the half width of the measured peak is 7  -1 , it is highly unlikely that pattern @xmath48 or pristine 60 are present in .",
    "we can rule out that each fullerene is connected to six cubanes . in this case , because of the stoichiometry , the c@xmath5h@xmath5 molecule should also show sixfold coordination , which would lead to a steric tension with six of the eight c atoms of the hydrocarbon bound to a 60  molecule .",
    "therefore structures @xmath50 and @xmath46 would automatically imply structure @xmath47 to be present as well .    according to our knowledge",
    "no fullerene compounds with the connection pattern @xmath51 and @xmath46 have been thoroughly investigated by vibrational spectroscopy so far .",
    "a similar well known structure only appears in the case of pattern @xmath43 : the two - dimensional rhombohedral 60  polymer@xcite has six pairs of @xmath52-bonds on hexagon - hexagon bonds of the 60  molecule , although arranged in a different way .",
    "the rhombohedral polymer shows the ( 2 ) peak at 1406  -1 ( ref . ) . we can expect a shift of similar magnitude in the case of pattern @xmath43 , but",
    "a peak with such a shift was not observed .",
    "another argument which confirms the absence of pattern @xmath43 comes from the polarization dependence of the raman spectrum .",
    "if  contained only fullerenes with @xmath33 symmetry , then the spectrum should show totally polarized modes , which is not the case .",
    "if , on the other hand , it contained fullerenes with different connection patterns and pattern @xmath43 were one of these , then the peaks should shift or at least change their shape as we change the polarization . as this",
    "was not observed either , we can again come to the conclusion that pattern @xmath43 is not present in .    up to this point we derived that  definitely contains fullerene units with connection pattern @xmath47 , but the possibility of patterns @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and/or @xmath46 can not be unambigously excluded .",
    "if more connection patterns are present , then many newly activated modes should appear , which would lead to a very rich spectrum , like e.g. that of the 60photopolymer.@xcite this is in contradiction to the observed spectra .",
    "the presence of sixfold , besides twofold , coordinated 60  would also mean that in the frequency region of the ,  and 1u  modes we would have to see at least 2 , 8 and 5 modes , respectively .",
    "instead , we only see somewhat broader peaks as usual",
    ". the only remaining possibility would be that all of the raman and infrared modes of the sixfold coordinated 60  units behave in a very similar way to those of the units with pattern @xmath47 , which would lead to unobservable splitting .",
    "this is very unlikely since the fullerene-  bonds in the two cases are different .",
    "thus , based on our infrared and raman measurements we propose that consists of  molecules and fullerene molecules connected according to pattern @xmath47 .",
    "the twofold coordination of the fullerene unit means that the unit also has a coordination number of two leading to a structure consisting of chains .",
    "we can not derive a definite assignment as to the structure of the cubane isomer connecting two fullerenes .",
    "one possible product , dihydropentalene , would lead to linear chains , but there are possibilities to introduce a 90@xmath55 turn as well .",
    "the simultaneous appearance of the two would introduce disorder in all directions , leading to the cubic and amorphous crystal structure in accordance with x - ray diffraction.@xcite the variety in the connecting cubane isomers would also explain the broadening of the vibrational lines .",
    "we can also relate the above conclusions to the structural data on  polymerized at various temperatures and pressures.@xcite iwasiewicz - wabnig _ et al .",
    "_ found two different polymer structures depending on polymerization temperature and pressure : a pseudo - cubic and a pseudo - orthorhombic one .",
    "they concluded from raman spectroscopy that the two do not differ significantly on the molecular level , but the pseudo - orthorhombic form is more ordered since its formation occurs at pressures where the rotation of the fullerene balls is sterically hindered .",
    "this leads us to believe that the d@xmath1 symmetry , compatible with the orthorhombic crystal structure , is intrinsic to the polymer , and the pseudo - cubic allotrope results from a disordered arrangement of these molecular units .",
    "we observed a reaction between the constituents on illumination at room temperature similar to that taking place on heating .",
    "after already 100  s of laser illumination in the raman microscope at both 531  nm and 468  nm , the intensity of the raman peak at 1469  -1  decreases and a new line at 1459 -1  appears . the raman spectrum obtained after about an hour of illumination by the 531  nm laser",
    "is depicted in fig  [ fig : cubfp ] .",
    "the new features in the spectrum coincide with those of the polymer produced by annealing .",
    "however , as we will see later , the polymerization here is not triggered by laser - induced heating .",
    "unfortunately we do not observe any cubane vibrations when exciting with the laser lines at 531  nm and 468  nm , so we do not know whether cubane isomerizes the same way as in the thermal polymerization process ; we can only deduce that the connection pattern of the fullerene is identical .",
    "the gradual evolution of the new spectral pattern around the @xmath12(2 ) mode during illumination is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : polproc ] .",
    "we fitted the spectra with three lorentzians : one for the ( 2 ) mode of the monomer , one for the ( 2 ) mode of the polymer and one for the ( 7 ) mode of the polymer .",
    "from the obtained integrated intensity values the intensity of the polymer ( 2 ) peak normalized to the total intensity of the two ( 2 ) peaks was calculated .",
    "we repeated the procedure for three exciting laser wavelengths : 531  nm , 468  nm and 676  nm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : colfp ] ) .",
    "we found that longer - wavelength laser lines ( 676  nm or 785  nm ) did not induce the reaction , therefore the effect of laser heating can be excluded .",
    "the wavelength dependence is analogous to that in 60 , where photopolymerization takes place on illumination.@xcite based on these analogies , we classify the reaction as photo - copolymerization with excitation of c@xmath0 as the first step .",
    "( we note that the photochemical reaction is also the reason why the accumulation time for the spectrum of the cocrystal taken at 531  nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : c60ram ] ) had to be shorter than for that taken at 785  nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : c60monram ] ) , which accounts for the poorer statistics of the former spectrum . )      in  a similar irreversible change as in  takes place on heating to 470  k. we show the raman and ir spectra of the reaction product in figs .",

    "et al_.@xcite the reaction leads to the disappearance of the cubane peaks from both the ir and raman spectra , and a new peak appears at 2946 -1 in the ir spectrum . at the same time the ir lines of the fullerene split , but the splitting is much less than in the 60 analogue .",
    "the raman lines only broaden , probably due to unresolved splitting .",
    "we found that below 800  -1 the splitting is twofold in the case of doubly degenerate e@xmath56 modes . above 800  -1",
    "no clear splitting can be seen , but the lines become somewhat smeared out . from the apparent twofold splitting of the low frequency e@xmath56 modes",
    "the loss of the fivefold axis can be concluded , corresponding to the point group of  being @xmath57 or one of its subgroups .",
    "the changes in the ir spectra of  on annealing reveal a reaction in which the cubane structure changes completely .",
    "the resulting hydrocarbon bonds to , whose cage distorts , but remains intact . as the reaction product is insoluble in common solvents,@xcite it must indeed be a polymer . at this stage of the research",

    "the ir and raman spectra of  and  were measured both in their rotor - stator and in their polymer phases .",
    "the rotor - stator nature of the cocrystals directly manifests itself in the spectra being simple superpositions of those of the constituents .",
    "hence , van der waals forces are the exclusive interaction between the static cubane and rotating fullerene molecules . the slightly lower frequency of the cubane lines can be explained on the basis of the highly polarizable environment of the cubane molecules in these structures .    in the ir and raman spectra of the polymer phases the fullerene lines",
    "are split and new lines appear , corresponding to a symmetry lowering of the fullerene molecules whilst their cage remains intact . as the cubane lines change dramatically during the polymerization , we conclude that the cubane isomerizes to another constitutional isomer , which binds to the fullerenes . according to the vibrational spectra no 60 - 60  bonding occurs .",
    "the comparison of structural and spectroscopic results allows us to identify linear chains connected via the apical cubane as the most probable polymerization pattern in , with possibly another cubane isomer introducing occasional 90@xmath55 turns in the chains .",
