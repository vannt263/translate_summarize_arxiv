    "in cosmology , solutions to einstein s field equations are obtained by imposing symmetries [ 1 ] on space - time .",
    "usually , spatial homogeneity is one of the reasonable assumptions ( in an average sense ) while for cosmological phenomena over galactic scale or in smaller scale , inhomogeneous solutions are useful .",
    "szekeres [ 2 ] in 1975 gave a class of inhomogeneous solutions representing irrotational dust .",
    "the space - time represented by these solutions has no killing vectors and it has invariant family of spherical hypersurfaces .",
    "hence this space - time is referred as quasi - spherical space - time . + an extensive study of gravitational collapse [ 3 - 8 ] has been carried out of tolman - bondi - lematre ( tbl ) spherically symmetric space - times containing irrotational dust to support or disprove the cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc ) .",
    "a general conclusion from these studies is that a central curvature singularity forms but its local or global visibility depends on the initial data .",
    "also over the past decades , the role of pressure within a collapsing cloud has been studied [ 9 - 13 ] but the actual role of pressure in determining the end state of a continual collapse is not yet clear . + on the other hand , there is very little progress in studying non - spherical collapse . basically , the difficulty is the ambiguity of horizon formation in non - spherical geometries and the influence of gravitational radiation . though there is hoop conjecture by thorne",
    "[ 14 ] to characterize the formation of horizon but only few works [ 15 - 19 ] have been done to confirm or refute the conjecture .",
    "recently , an extensive study of irrotational dust collapse has been done in quasi - spherical szekeres space - time both for four [ 20 ] and higher [ 21 ] dimensions . in this paper , we have done an extensive analysis of szekeres model with matter containing pressure and studied the collapsing procedure to examine the role of pressure in characterizing the final singularity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the szekeres model [ 22 ] has been described in section ii . the perfect fluid solution with asymptotic",
    "behaviour has been presented in section iii .",
    "section iv deals with the tangential stress only while section v deals with gravitational collapse with non - isotropic pressure .",
    "finally , the paper ends with a brief discussion in section vi .",
    "the metric ansatz for the four dimensional szekeres space - time [ 22 ] is of the form    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions of all space - time variables",
    "i.e. , @xmath3    considering both radial and transverse stresses the energy momentum tensor has the following structure @xmath4    hence the full set of einstein equations are    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    where dot , dash and subscript stands for partial differentiation with respect to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the corresponding variables respectively ( e.g. , @xmath17 ) .",
    "+ combining the time derivatives of equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) with the differentiation of ( 8) with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath19 separately we have the integrability condition    @xmath20    hence we may have three possibilities namely ,    @xmath21    following szekeres [ 22 ] the field equations are not solvable for the third case so we shall consider only the first two cases .",
    "+ the energy conservation equation namely @xmath22 gives    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    now for the first choice namely @xmath27 we have from the field equations the explicit form of the metric coefficients are as follows :    @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 satisfy the following differential equations    @xmath32    and @xmath33    here we have assumed @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( 21 ) has the first integral    @xmath35    while one of the possible solutions of equation ( 22 ) can be taken as [ 24 ]    @xmath36    where the arbitrary functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are related as    @xmath39    and @xmath40 is an arbitrary function .",
    "+ for the choice ( @xmath41 ) the metric coefficients are of the form    @xmath42    @xmath43    then as before from the field equation ( 4 ) we have similar differential equation in @xmath30 and @xmath31 as @xmath44 @xmath45    with @xmath46 an arbitrary constant .",
    "also for @xmath31 we choose as in case ( a )    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are arbitrary constants restricted by the relation    @xmath50    now to determine the function @xmath51 we have from the field equation ( 7 )    @xmath52    and then from the field equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we have a possible solution    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are arbitrary functions of @xmath16 alone .",
    "+ also the differential equation in @xmath56 is    @xmath57    with @xmath58    now for explicit solutions , we shall consider the following cases in the next sections : + ( i )  the perfect fluid model ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) + ( ii )  the tangential stress only ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) + ( iii )  the general case ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) .",
    "+ in fact , cosmological solutions are obtained ( in sections iii and iv ) for the first two cases respectively while for the third case collapsing behaviour has been studied and the role of pressure has been examined . +",
    "in this case due to energy conservation equations ( 16)-(18 ) the isotropic pressure is function of @xmath15 only i.e. , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) . as there is no restriction on the energy density",
    "so @xmath64 is in general a function of all the 4 variables i.e. , @xmath65 and hence no equation of state is imposed . + now for explicit solution according to szafron [ 25 ] and szafron and wainwright [ 26 ] we choose @xmath66    ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 are positive constants ) and we have the general solution for @xmath30 as [ 23 ]    @xmath69 + c_{2}y_{\\xi}[\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{|s-2|}t^{-\\frac{s-2}{2}}]\\right\\}\\\\ \\\\ \\sqrt{t}\\left\\{c_{1}j_{\\xi}[\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{|s-2|}t^{-\\frac{s-2}{2 } } ] + c_{2}j_{-\\xi}[\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{|s-2|}t^{-\\frac{s-2}{2}}]\\right\\}\\\\ \\\\ c_{1}t^{q_{1}}+c_{2}t^{1-q_{1 } } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    according as @xmath70 is an integer , non - integer and @xmath71 . here",

    "+ now , the physical and kinematical parameters have the following expressions    @xmath78    @xmath79    @xmath80^{2}\\ ] ]    the above solution is for the choice ( @xmath81 ) ( see eq.(13 ) ) . for the choice ( @xmath41 ) ( i.e. , eq.(14 ) ) the explicit form for @xmath30 is same as in equation ( 34 ) except here @xmath72 and @xmath73 are arbitrary constants and @xmath82 .",
    "but we note that the differential equation ( 30 ) is not solvable for the above explicit solutions for @xmath30 .",
    "the physical and kinematical parameters have the expressions as    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85^{2}\\ ] ]    @xmath86    we shall now discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the above solutions .",
    "the co - ordinates vary over the range : @xmath87 .",
    "for both the choices ( @xmath81 ) and ( @xmath41 ) as @xmath88 so we must have @xmath89 .",
    "so for @xmath71 for large @xmath15 ,    @xmath90    hence as @xmath91 , ( @xmath92 ) fall off faster compare to ( @xmath93 ) , while the scale factor @xmath30 gradually increases with time .",
    "so the model approaches isotropy along fluid world line as @xmath91 .",
    "for this model we have from the conservation equation ( 18 ) @xmath94 i.e. choice ( b ) is only possible here . also from the other conservation equations namely equation ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) we have @xmath95    where a(r , t ) is an arbitrary function of @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "but for the consistency of the differential eq.(30 ) @xmath96 ( as stated earlier ) must be a function of @xmath16 and @xmath15 and hence @xmath1 should be independent of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . as a consequence , in the solution ( 26 ) for @xmath1 , @xmath51 must be independent of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus for the solution ( 32 ) for @xmath51 we should have @xmath97 hence we have @xmath98 , an arbitrary function of r alone and @xmath99 .",

    "the difference comes in the matter density . for dust model",
    "@xmath64 is a function of all the four co - ordinate variables while in the presence of tangential stress @xmath64 is a function of @xmath15 and @xmath16 only . finally , the asymptotic behaviour for both the model will be very similar . +",
    "in the general case when both radial and tangential pressures are non - zero and distinct then from the einstein equations they can be obtained in compact form as @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 . + since @xmath123 is regular initially at the centre and blows up at the singularity so we can choose @xmath123 to be of the form :    @xmath124    where @xmath125 is an arbitrary function such that @xmath126 near @xmath127 to make initial matter density non - zero at the centre @xmath127 and @xmath128 is any constant . as a consequence , the expressions for matter density and tangential stress become    @xmath129      where @xmath131 and @xmath132 is an arbitrary integration function . also the radial velocity of collapsing shells at a distance @xmath16 from the centre",
    "is given by    @xmath133    now if we choose @xmath134 initially then at the beginning of the collapse the density and the tangential stress have the initial values    @xmath135    @xmath136+\\frac{g'(r)}{2r^{n-1}(1+r\\nu')}\\ ] ]    where @xmath137 .",

    "these coefficients are related among themselves through the relations ( 54 ) and ( 55 ) as follows :    @xmath146    @xmath147 @xmath148    according as @xmath149 or @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "+ the hypersurface @xmath152 describing the shell focusing singularity is characterized by    @xmath153    as the differential equation in @xmath30 ( i.e. , eq.(53 ) ) is not solvable so we shall consider only the marginally bound case ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) . hence in this case , the singularity hypersurface can be written in explicit form as    @xmath154\\ ] ]    where @xmath155 is the usual hypergeometric function with @xmath156  .",
    "+      the event horizon of observers at infinity plays an important role in the nature of the singularity . as formation of event horizon depends greatly on the computation of null geodesics",
    "whose computation are almost impracticable for the present space - time geometry , so we consider closely related concept of a trapped surface ( namely a compact space - like 2-surface whose normals on both sides are future pointing converging null geodesic families ) .",
    "in fact , if the 2-surface @xmath157 ( @xmath158constant , @xmath159constant ) is a trapped surface then it and its entire future development lie behind the event horizon provided the density falls off fast enough at infinity .",
    "so mathematically , if @xmath160 denotes the tangent vector field to the null geodesics which is normal to @xmath157 then we have @xmath161    now the convergence or divergence of the null geodesics is characterized by the sign of the invariant @xmath162 evaluated on the surface @xmath163 ( in fact , @xmath164 indicates convergence while @xmath165 stands for divergence ) . it can be shown that the inward geodesics converges initially and throughout the collapsing process while the outward geodesics diverges initially but becomes convergent after a time @xmath166 ( time of formation of apparent horizon ) given by @xmath167    now using equations ( 23 ) and ( 50 ) we have    @xmath168    or using the explicit solution for @xmath30 ( from eq.(53 ) )    @xmath169- \\frac{2r^{3/2}(t_{ah},r)}{3\\sqrt{c(r)}}~_{2}f_{1}[\\frac{1}{2},b , b+1,\\frac{g(r)r^{3-n}(t_{ah},r)}{c(r)(3-n)}]\\ ] ]    from the equations ( 60 ) and ( 62 ) we see that the shell focusing singularity that appears at @xmath170 is in the future of the apparent horizon .",
    "+ as we are interested in central shell focusing singularity ( at @xmath127 ) , so its time of occurrence is given by      where in evaluating the limit we have used the series form of @xmath125 and @xmath132 ( from eq .",
    "( 56 ) ) . now",
    "if we restrict @xmath172 then we have a comparative expression between @xmath166 and @xmath173 as    @xmath174 + \\frac{(c_{0}g_{1}-c_{1}g_{0})}{(3-n)(9 - 2n)}c_{0}^{-5/2}~_{2}f_{1}[\\frac{3}{2},b+1,b+2,z]\\right]r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      note that here @xmath173 is the time of formation of singularity at @xmath127 while @xmath166 is the epoch at which a trapped surface is formed at a distance @xmath16 .",
    "thus if trapped surface is formed at a later instant than @xmath173 then it is possible that any light signal from the singularity can reach an observer .",
    "as the geometry of the present model is a class of spherical space - time having different centres , so the condition for formation of ns ( or bh ) will be same as tbl model .",

    "i.e. , @xmath185 ) we have negative definite @xmath186 and there is always naked singularity as in the dust model .",
    "similarly in the second case ( i.e. , @xmath187 ) , @xmath186 is positive definite and we always get black hole same as dust model . for the third and fourth cases ( when @xmath188 and @xmath72 are of same sign ) both naked singularity ( ns ) and black hole ( bh ) are possible for the restrictions given in the table i. when both @xmath188 and @xmath72 are positive ( third case ) or negative ( fourth case ) then for formation of ns @xmath186 is negative but for bh case as there is no lower limit ( or upper limit ) of @xmath189 ( or @xmath190 ) so @xmath191 or @xmath183 are possible .",

    "@xmath197 has been shown in figures 1 and 2 for positive and negative @xmath72 respectively . in both the figures the vertical positive region corresponds to ns while the negative region stands for bh solution .",
    "finally , we see that if the initial density or pressure has opposite behaviour ( i.e. , one increases and other decreases and vise - versa ) near the centre @xmath127 then we have similar character of the singularity as in dust model i.e. , pressure has no significant effect on the singularity formation . on the other hand , if initial density and pressure increase or decrease simultaneously near the centre then even for negative density gradient at the centre it is possible to have a bh formation at @xmath127 , which is a distinct result in compare to dust model .",

    "so no definite conclusion is possible on the role of pressure in determining in the final state of collapse by orng .",
    "an extensive analysis of the four dimensional szekeres model has been done for the matter containing pressure .",
    "when matter is in the form of perfect fluid then the isotropic pressure turns out to be a function of time only while the matter density is a function of all the four space - time variables . in this case , assuming a polynomial form for pressure , cosmological solutions have been obtained and their asymptotic behaviour have been studied .",
    "both in quasi - spherical and quasi - cylindrical model the solution approaches isotropy along fluid world line as @xmath242 .",

    "lastly , gravitational collapse has been studied in details for anisotropic pressure ( i.e. , both radial and tangential pressures are non - zero and distinct ) in quasi - spherical model . here",
    "we have to assume the radial pressure as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath15 of the form ( see eq .",
    "( 50 ) ) @xmath245 . also to solve the differential equation in @xmath30",
    "( 53 ) ) we consider only the marginally bound case ( i.e. , @xmath246 ) only",
    ". then equation ( 64 ) shows a comparative study between the time of formation of trapped surface and the time of formation of central singularity . to simplified further ,",
    "we choose @xmath179 and detailed analysis has been done using equation ( 65 ) .",
    "table i shows all possibilities for the parameters involved in the expression . if the initial density gradient at the centre is positive definite ( or negative definite ) then as in dust case we have definitely a black hole ( or naked singularity ) as the final state of collapse .",
    "but when @xmath186 has no definite sign ( as in third and fourth cases ) then for black hole solution it is possible to have negative density gradient at the centre initially . in fact , near the singularity if the initial density and pressure has identical behaviour ( i.e. , increase or decrease simultaneously ) then even with negative density gradient ( initially at the centre ) we can have black hole as the end state but if the initial density and pressure has opposite behaviour ( i.e. , one decrease while other increases and vice versa ) then we have identical character as in dust case .",
    "so we conclude that pressure tries to resist the formation of naked singularity .",
    "finally we have studied the geodesics to examine whether it is possible to have any future directed non space - like geodesic terminating in the past at the singularity . for simplicity ,",
    "we have considered only radial null geodesic and it is found that the end state of collapse is characterized by the coefficients of the series expansion of initial density and pressure ( radial ) . due to complicated expressions we can not definitely characterize the role of pressure .",
