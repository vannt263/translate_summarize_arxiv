    "in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) giant loops of h@xmath0ii  regions can be recognized in deep pictures taken in h@xmath14 light .",
    "these h@xmath0ii  structures were divided by goudis & meaburn ( 1978 ) into two distinct groups : shell structures called giant shells ( gss ) with diameters of 20@xmath15pc and the huge supergiant shells ( sgss ) with diameters of 600@xmath16pc . employing unsharp masking techniques and high contrast copying of the long exposed h@xmath14 images of davies et al .",
    "( 1976 , hereafter dem ) , meaburn and collaborators ( see meaburn 1980 ) subsequently identified 85 gss and 9 sgss in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and 1 sgs in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .    unlike gss",
    "whose stucture can be explained by the combined activity of supernova explosions , stellar winds and radiation pressure of the central star association(s ) , sgss ( i.e. structures about @xmath17kpc in diameter ) need very effective , gigantic mechanisms for their creation .",
    "such large scale features , which rival in size only with spiral structures , might be created , according to the appraisal of mechanisms by tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer ( 1988 ) , by the collision of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) with the disk of the galaxy or by stochastic self - propagating star formation ( sspsf ) .",
    "the infall of an hvc would cause a well defined velocity deviating from the velocity of the original disk gas .",
    "also , because of the short time scale of such a collision , an almost identical age is expected for all stars whose formation was triggered by that event .    in the case of sspsf ( see feitzinger et al .",
    "1981 ) star formation propagates from one point ( e.g. the centre of a sgs ) in all directions ( e.g. towards the rim of a sgs ) .",
    "thus one should see in projection two velocity components in the h@xmath0i  layer ( a receeding and an approaching component ) as well as a clear age gradient of the star populations inside a sgs",
    ".    however , the observation of a central area of a sgs with little gas ( i.e. a hole in the h@xmath0i  layer ) and of an approximately @xmath18pc thick shell of neutral material , which is ionized at the inner edge ( visible as h@xmath14 filaments ) by the radiation from the associations containing numerous early type stars ( see lucke & hodge 1970 ; lucke 1974 ) in the centre of the sgs , would be consistent with both scenarios .",
    "the importance of understanding the formation and the structure of sgss is evident if one realizes how big they are .",
    "they may dominate large portions of a galaxy , in particular of the smaller irregular galaxies , such as the magellanic clouds are .",
    "knowledge about the creation of sgss leads to a better knowledge of the more recent development of the mcs and of their youngest star populations .",
    "the shape and size of lmc@xmath04 is such , that sspsf has been considered as the most likely explanation for the formation of this sgs ( see dopita et al .",
    "however , observations of star groups along the edge of lmc@xmath04 showed that the ages of these groups were of the same order as the time needed to create the sgs in the case of sspsf ( see vallenari et al .",

    "furthermore , domgrgen et al . (",
    "1995 ) presented an investigation of lmc@xmath04 based on h@xmath0i  data and iue spectra .",
    "one result is that there is only one distinct velocity component towards us with @xmath20 and just a diffuse rear component .",
    "this is not consistent with an undisturbed expanding shell , but it indicates a break - out of the sgs at the back side of the lmc .",
    "so lmc@xmath04 resembles a cylinder rather than a sphere which should be expected in a galaxy with an h@xmath0i  scale height well below @xmath21pc .",

    "this statement is valid for all objects older than @xmath169myr .",
    "both ngc@xmath01948 and ngc@xmath01978 are part of the @xmath170 key region e centered at ra : @xmath171 and dec : @xmath172 ( de boer et al . 1989 , 1991 ; will et al .",
    "lmc@xmath04 contains a substantial population of young stars of age 10@xmath13myr , while a quite older ( @xmath173myr ) background population may exist .",
    "a huge gas cloud must have been present in which the conditions were favourable for the burst of star formation @xmath174myr ago .",
    "the consequences of that burst are observed today .",
    "these can be summarized as follows .",
    "a volume of which we see the projected surface area of about @xmath17kpc@xmath25 is filled with essentially coeval stars .",
    "the volume contains little neutral gas in numerous low column density filaments ( domgrgen et al .",
    "1995 ) , and at the same time clearly contains ionzed gas ( see bomans et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "inside lmc@xmath04 we have a large number of young main sequence stars . from the present day mass function ,",
    "extended with the same slope to the mass rich end to also include the original mass rich stars , we can calculate the number of stars in each mass range @xmath175 $ ] initially present in our j-shaped region :    @xmath176{l } \\int\\limits_{m_{\\rm l}}^{m_{\\rm u } } 10^{4.972\\,(22 ) } \\cdot ( { \\cal m}/{\\mbox{${\\cal m}_{\\odot}$}})^{-2.716\\,(44)}\\;d{\\cal m } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    a fit to the geneva evolutionary tracks ( schaerer et al .",
    "1993 ) for an initial mass @xmath177 yields a stellar lifetime relation of :    @xmath178{l } ( 86 \\pm 10)\\;{\\rm myr } \\cdot ( { \\cal m}/{\\mbox{${\\cal m}_{\\odot}$}})^{-0.722\\,(62 ) } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    stars with an initial mass above @xmath179 will become supernovae of type ii . combining eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) with @xmath180 we get the number of supernovae after a given time : @xmath181{l } 1.4 \\cdot ( t/[{\\rm myr}])^{2.38 } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    for star populations one would expect all stars with @xmath182\\;{\\mbox{${\\cal m}_{\\odot}$}}$ ] to have exploded into sne in the first 10@xmath13myr .",
    "thus we get @xmath183 , for roughly 5% of the lmc@xmath04 area . extrapolating from the j-shaped region to the entire interior of lmc@xmath04",
    "means that in this sgs of 10@xmath13myr age about 57@xmath184 supernovae have exploded . with an average supernova energy output of 10@xmath185erg",
    "the total number of past sne will have dumped at least 10@xmath186erg into lmc@xmath04 .",
    "on the other hand , the supernova rate right after starformation is very small and eq .",
    "( 8) indicates that after 5@xmath13myr only @xmath187 200 sne have exploded inside lmc@xmath04 , or less than 10% of the total in 10@xmath13myr .    at present",
    "there is little neutral gas inside lmc@xmath04 , whereas the structure must have had lots of relatively dense neutral gas for the star formation .",
    "we can estimate the minimum energy input required to dissolve the birth cloud . assuming a thickness of originally 500@xmath13pc with a gas density  in the volume @xmath2 , the energy needed for total ionization is @xmath188ev = @xmath189erg @xmath190 .",
    "a further calculation shows that roughly @xmath191erg @xmath190 can accelerate all particles of the entire birth cloud to 100@xmath13 , enough to disrupt the cloud .",
    "this energy is easily provided by the supernovae .",
    "in fact , a substantial fraction of the energy needed is already released between 5 and 8@xmath13myr .    summarizing , based on the recognition that all young stars of lmc@xmath04 are nearly coeval at 10@xmath13myr , and on the sequel that supernovae will go off everywhere inside lmc@xmath04 at a fair rate dumping energy rather evenly in the birth cloud",
    ", we can explain the structure of lmc@xmath04 as we see it today .    in consequence of that , once the first supernovae occur , their individual ( but soon the collective )",
    "blast waves may trigger star formation at the edges .",
    "this fits with the age derived for lh@xmath072 south .",
    "starformation at the edges of lmc@xmath04 will have taken place at very recent times as secondary process .",
    "we expect that an age determination for the stars in any of the h@xmath0ii  regions to the east of lmc@xmath04 will show very young ( @xmath54 5@xmath13myr ) ages , like the ones at the nw ( will et al .",
    "1996 ) and the sw ( petr et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the present supernova rate inside lmc@xmath04 as calculated from our equations is about 1 per 670@xmath13yr which is comparable to the sn rate of the whole lmc derived from counting supernova remnants ( chu & kennicutt 1988 ) .",
    "our mass function and main sequence lifetime indicate an increase of the sn rate to 1 per 120@xmath13yr in 25@xmath13myr from now , at a time when the stars of originally 8@xmath192 will explode .",
    "the ages found for the stars inside lmc@xmath04 lie in the range of @xmath6myr to @xmath7myr without a visible correlation with the distance to the lmc@xmath04 centre ( see table 4 and fig .",
    "this means that there must have been one triggering event for star formation inside the greatest sgs of the lmc with a diameter of @xmath8kpc , whereas at the rim of lmc@xmath04 there is evidence for sspsf ( petr et al .",
    "1994 ; petr 1994 ) .",
    "thus sspsf ca nt be the creation mechanism of lmc@xmath04 as claimed by the first models ( see e.g. dopita et al . 1985 ) , even if one is able to find examples of sspsf in this region on scales below @xmath193pc .",
