    "in the recent opera neutrino experiment at gran sasso laboratory , superluminal propagation of neutrinos was reportedly observed @xcite . since then",
    "lots of explanations of this surprising result have emerged , e.g.  discussions on ( the inconsistencies of ) tachyons @xcite , on ( the problematic relation with ) astrophysical data @xcite , on environmental explanation @xcite , on experimental details @xcite , on general relativity effects @xcite , etc .",
    "( for a full list see the papers citing @xcite ) .",
    "we assume in this note that the experiment is correct , so there is no systematic shift in the measured data",
    ". then one can ask whether it is possible to send a bit of information faster than the speed of light with this experimental setup , which would really mean violation of the lorentz symmetry or , even worse , of the well known causality principle .",
    "apparent violation is appealing but not conclusive ( see @xcite for a related idea ) . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that apparent superluminal phenomena exist , such as the famous epr paradox with superluminal ` spooky ' action at distance .",
    "however , up to now it has proved impossible to send information faster than light .",
    "during the experiment an approximately step - shaped proton distribution function ( pdf ) was produced at cern with time length of about @xmath0  ns , see fig .",
    "[ fig : prot_pdf ] ( and also fig .  9 of @xcite for the precise form ) . just after the measurement of the pdf , the protons hit a target , resulting in the productions of the mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which subsequently decay into muonic neutrinos .",
    "the latter travel for about @xmath3 km in the inner earth crust and reach the neutrino detectors of opera placed in gran sasso .",
    "one expects that the distribution of muonic neutrinos has the same ( or very similar ) shape of the original pdf . in this way it is possible to measure the ( mean ) velocity of muonic neutrinos .",
    "the finding is that the neutrino step function arrives about @xmath4 ns earlier than expected .",
    "technically , one has to shift by @xmath5 ns the ( scaled ) pdf corresponding to the travel with the speed of light @xmath6 then , one has to correct for @xmath7 ns , which is the resulting time delay of various desynchronization effects .",
    "finally , one is left with the striking result that the neutrinos arrived @xmath8 ns ` before light ' , thus travelling at a velocity @xmath9 . for the following discussion it is crucial to stress that the resulting time shift of @xmath4 ns , and therefore the conclusion that @xmath9 , is the result of a statistical analysis including the leading as well as the trailing edges of the step functions .",
    "it is a collective result based on the full length of the signal of about @xmath0 ns .",
    "we turn now to the main question of this note : is it possible to send a bit of information with the described opera experimental setup ?",
    "one may ask whether waiting only for the leading edge of the signal would be enough ( see the left plots of fig .",
    "12 of @xcite ) .",
    "the leading edge lasts about @xmath10 ns , which is much larger than the @xmath4 ns time difference . restricting to these data only",
    ", it is very hard to see any time shift .",
    "moreover , the data oscillate and it would be impossible to agree on the exact time of the incoming of the bit .",
    "more in general , it seems impossible to send a bit of information faster than light using only a very small portion of the pdf .    in the next section we elaborate in more detail , by considering a simple modification of the pdf , on the possibility to send a bit of information .",
    "suppose we want to use the cngs neutrino stream to transfer one bit , such that the _ information _ arrives earlier than it would have had with standard light - based communication .",
    "one would then need to shape the pdf ( and the subsequent travelling neutrino packet ) as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : bit_encode ] ( we assume that the proton beam can be blocked at will ) . over a background without neutrinos ,",
    "a bit - carrying signal is composed by two parts : part ( i ) triggers the receiver , warning it that the bit will be encoded in part ( ii ) .",
    "this two - part structure is necessary because the receiver does not know in advance when exactly will the information be sent .",
    "an important observation is that , while the `` button '' at cern is pressed corresponding to point @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bit_encode ] , the bit will be completely received only at point @xmath12 , that is , after the whole sequence has been decoded , neglecting processing times and similar practicalities .",
    "thus the whole bit takes a somewhat large time @xmath13 to be transmitted .",
    "moreover , the duration of parts ( i ) and ( ii ) have to be previously agreed upon by both sides . denoting the time - resolution of the receiver by @xmath14",
    "ns , we can write @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the ( smallest ) number of data points necessary to identify unambiguously the onset of a signal . looking at the error bars and slope of the curves in fig .  12 of @xcite ( also sketched here in fig .",
    "[ fig : bit_encode ] ) , we give a conservative estimate @xmath17 .    in order to achieve a truly faster - than - light transmission of a bit , one needs even the _ tail _ ( point @xmath12 ) of the packet to arrive faster than a light signal , shot at moment @xmath11 , hence @xmath18 in the real - life case of the opera setup , the right - hand side is @xmath4 ns , which makes it impossible to fulfill the above requirement .",
    "one may argue that a simple one - pulse signal ( much like part ( i ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : bit_encode ] alone ) would already imply violation of lorentz symmetry ( or causality ) .",
    "this situation just amounts to dropping the factor @xmath19 in eq .",
    "[ req ] , but the conclusions would remain unchanged .",
    "moreover , it should also be noted that receiving a neutrino in the detector implies a further time delay before the data are received by the observer .",
    "this is contrary to receiving a photon , where the use of scintillators allow for an ( almost ) instantaneous processing : taking this into account amounts in a further increase in @xmath16 .",
    "finally , it is amusing to imagine the existence of a straight tunnel connecting cern and gran sasso",
    ". this tunnel would be helpful to send , starting at the same time @xmath20 , a standard light - bit . in this way it could be possible to check which _ signal _ arrives first .",
    "unfortunately , as ( almost ) everyone knows , the construction of such a tunnel is impossible for the moment ( the price would surely overshoot @xmath21 euros ) .",
    "in this work we have studied if it is possible to send a bit of information with speed larger than @xmath22 with the experimental setup of opera .",
    "our result is negative : at present , this does not seem to be feasible .    our arguments are based on the particular present setup and therefore one may object that , by improving the luminosity and the precision of the experiment , or putting the neutrino detectors much further away , the sending of a signal faster than @xmath22 would be indeed possible .",
    "however , this represents an extrapolation which is based on the assumption that nothing will change when doing that . due to the fact",
    "that lorentz symmetry and causality are basic principles of our understanding of nature , we believe that the rejection of ( at least ) one of them should be motivated by the actual transmission of a bit of information faster than @xmath22 and not by an extrapolation : nature may be subtle , protecting these basic principles with the help of some not yet understood ` censorship ' mechanism ."
