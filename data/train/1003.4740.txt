    "almost all analytic work based on the halo - model approach assumes that haloes are spherically symmetric and that the matter density distribution around each halo centre is smooth .",

    "the main purpose of this work is to include recent advances in our understanding of halo substructures into the halo model approach .",

    "[ netoeq ] , [ seljakeq ] , [ zhaoeq ] and [ pierieq ] ) .",
    "before we proceed , let us briefly summarize the main ingredients of our extension to the halo model .",
    "* the abundance and bias of host haloes are taken from @xcite . *",
    "host haloes and subhaloes are assumed to have nfw density profiles .",
    "* we study deterministic ( d1 ) and stochastic ( d2 ) models of halo concentration at fixed mass , and explore three different choices for the mean relation between mass and concentration ( c1 , c2 , c3 ) .",
    "* we study two choices for the density run of subhaloes around the center of the host : either it is the same nfw profile as the smooth component ( s1 ) , or it has the form suggested by @xcite ( s2 ) . *",
    "the mass function of subhalos is given by equation  ( [ subeq ] ) , found in and normalized to numerical simulations .",
    "* the concentration of subhaloes increases towards the centre of their host halo , in agreement with numerical simulations @xcite . as we describe below , our halo model includes this effect only rather crudely .",
    "in this section , we describe the halo - model approach at the non - linear dark - matter power spectrum and study how it changes at small scales when different models for the mass - concentration relation are taken into account .",
    "we will also show how the non - linear power spectrum can be decomposed when a realistic model for the substructure mass function in host haloes and two models for their spatial distribution are taken into account .",
    "the formalism for the substructure contribution to the one - halo term of the non - linear dark - matter power spectrum has been developed by @xcite . here , we shall also consider the clump contributions to the two - halo term and show the relevant equations .      in the halo model approach @xcite ,",
    "the two - point dark - matter correlation function is @xmath102 where the first or poisson term describes the contribution to the matter density from individual haloes , while the second term describes the contribution from halo correlations .",
    "while both terms require knowledge of the halo mass function and their dark - matter density profiles , the second needs also the two - point correlation function of haloes of different mass @xmath103 .",
    "since the two - point correlation function on large scales is dominated by the two - halo term and has to follow the linear correlation function , a good and convenient way to express the two - halo correlation function is @xmath104 in view of later convolutions , it is convenient to work in fourier space .",
    "we then define the dark matter power spectrum @xmath105 as @xmath106 for further convenience , and as is common in the large scale structure community , we define the dimensionless quantity @xmath107 the dark matter power spectrum can be decomposed as @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110}^2 \\label{pkhalo2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the one- and two - halo contributions . here , @xmath111 is the bias factor with respect to the dark - matter of halos of mass @xmath12 at @xmath55 having concentration @xmath112 .",

    "]    the most commonly used approximations in the literature @xcite use the deterministic model d1 for the concentration distribution and consider steep models for the mass - concentration relation in order to not loose small scale power .        in fig .",
    "[ pks ] we show the non - linear dark - matter power spectrum predicted using the halo model , as described above , divided by the power - spectrum fit by @xcite at four different redshifts ( from top to bottom ) and assuming three models for the mass - concentration relation ( from left to right ) .",

    "the dotted - dashed line in the right panels shows the shot - noise limit in the millennium simulation , which we do not remove from the numerical power spectrum , at the corresponding redshifts .    from the figure",
    ", we notice that model c1 reproduces the ms power spectrum quite well up to @xmath116 , while model c2 performs better .",

    "note that the stochastic concentration model ( d2 ) increases the power on small scales ( @xmath118 ) by 15 to 20% compared to the deterministic ( d1 ) case .",

[ subeq ] ) , while @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the functions @xmath126 and @xmath127 where we also take into account the scatter in at fixed mass in the subhalo mass - concentration relation when the stochastic model is considered .",
    "the subhalo concentration depends on its mass and also on its radial distance from the host halo centre ( see eq.[mcsub ] ) .",

    "models s1 and s2 for the subclump distribution within the host are adopted in the different panels .",
    "note that in both the 1- and 2-halo terms , the dominant contribution is due to pairs in which both members are in the smooth component ; smooth - clump and clump - clump pairs never contribute more than 10% of the signal , and they become even less dominant at large @xmath91 .",
    "the transition scale is around @xmath137 , since it represents the size of a typical collapsed halo in which the clumps are located .",
    "for @xmath138 the smooth - clump and clump - clump terms start to drop down due to the density profile distribution of subhaloes in the host system . in other words , for scale smaller then 1 mpc @xmath139 the two - point probability has a threshold due to the typical distribution scale of the clumps within the virial radius of the host . comparing right and left panels we notice that the power - spectrum components are quite sensitive to the more rapid decrease of the fourier transform model s2 ( right panels ) compared to model s1 ( left panels ) , both in the 1-halo and the 2-halo terms",
    ". however , the contribution from pairs within the same subclump ( self - clump ) increases with @xmath91 reaching values of order @xmath140 at @xmath141 , this is due to the matter density profile distribution in small clumps , more and more concentrated as their mass decrises . the probability to find a pair of points of the same clump becames larger and larger as the scale decreases ",

    "we begin by writing down the contributions to the 1-halo term of the cross - correlation power spectrum between haloes and matter .",
    "sitting at the center of a host halo , and assuming that the matter is divided into smooth and clumpy components , the halo - smooth self - correlation and the halo - clump cross - correlation can be written as @xmath144 and @xmath145 we recall that @xmath146 is the smooth mass of the host halo , @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the fourier transforms of the density profiles of the smooth component and of the clump distribution respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 is the halo mass function at redshift @xmath55 and @xmath149 is given by eq .",
    "( [ inti ] ) .    regarding the contributions to large scales ( the 2-halo term ) , we start from the same idea , i.e.  we imagine sitting at the center of a host halo and cross - correlate with the smooth and the clumpy components of a _ distant _ halo",
    ". however , in this case we also have to take the halo bias relative to the dark matter distribution into account , as well as the non - linear dark - matter power spectrum .",
    "the smooth and clump cross - correlation power spectra are @xmath150 and @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 given by eqs .",
    "( [ sieq ] ) and ( [ cieq ] ) .",
    "let us now place ourselves at the center of a clump and determine the cross - correlation on small scales .",
    "in this case , the 1-halo term will be the sum of three components : ( i ) the self - correlation with the substructure mass ; ( ii ) the cross - correlation with the mass in the other substructures contained in the same host halo , and ( iii ) the cross - correlation with the smooth component .",
    "these three terms are @xmath154 further @xmath155 and @xmath156 where we have underlined that @xmath157 , the number of substructures in a @xmath12-halo , depends on the mass through the concentration and on redshift . for the 2-halo term , we have two equations analogous to those of the halo - matter cross - correlation , and we need to integrate over the substructure mass function .",
    "we find @xmath158 and @xmath159 we show the results in real space for each component of the cross - correlation after the inverse fourier transform @xmath160 where the index @xmath161 runs over all halo and substructure cross - correlation terms .",
    "going from fourier to real space , some of the 1-halo terms are simple , because we are inverse fourier transforming the nfw density profile and the density run of subclumps in the host ( see eq .",
    "[ eqclumpdist ] ) . for the model s1 , in which subclumps follow the dark matter distribution ,",
    "terms like @xmath162 are the convolution of two nfw profiles , so they can also be written analytically @xcite .        in fig .",
    "[ crossfig1 ] , we show the cross - correlation between haloes and matter ( left panels ) as well as between substructures and matter ( right panels ) at the two different redshifts @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "these represent the mean redshifts of galaxies in the sdss @xcite and in typical weak - lensing surveys , respectively . in the left panels ,",
    "we show the halo - matter cross - correlation function considering the two components both in the 1- and 2-halo terms .",
    "we adopt models c3 , d2 with @xmath165 and s2 .",
    "the solid and dotted curves show the total cross - correlation , with distributions s1 and s2 for placing substructures in the host halo .",
    "notice that , in the host mass cross - correlation , the latter choice does not influence the total . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross - correlation between substructures and mass is sensitive to the choice of the radial subclump distribution . in the right panels ,",
    "we show the cross correlation between clump and mass . here , too , we show the three components of the 1-halo term and the two components of the 2-halo term .",
    "the solid and dotted curves are , respectively , the total predicted signal using models s1 and s2 . from the figure we notice that substructures contribute a signature on scales of order @xmath166 kpc or so .    in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ crossfig2 ] , we show the cross - correlation function between haloes and matter , splitting the contributions into different host - halo mass bins . the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ crossh1 ] , [ crossh2 ] , [ crossh3 ] ) and ( [ crossh4 ] ) have been performed between the lower and upper bounds of each bin , while @xmath167 and @xmath168 have been integrated over all masses .",
    "the solid line shows the total power spectrum from haloes in the entire mass range , i.e.  between @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the curves are normalized to the mean number of haloes in the entire range .",
    "the long - dashed - dotted curve in the left panels , shows the model of @xcite . in their model",
    "the 1-halo term is due to the dark matter density profile of the host halo , while the two halo term by the product between bias factor and the mass autocorrelation function predicted by the linear theory . in their model",
    "we consider the mean mass predicted by the @xcite mass function between @xmath169 and @xmath170 .    in the right panels ,",
    "we show the substructure - mass cross - correlation considering clumps in the same host - halo mass bins .",
    "these curves have been normalized by the mean number of clumps in haloes between @xmath169 and @xmath170 . in this case , showing the predicted contribution from different mass bins , we account for halo exclusion in the halo - mass cross correlation .",
    "an accurate treatment of halo exclusion may be numerically tedious . here",
    ", we adopt an approximate approach in which the 2-halo term vanishes on scales smaller than the virial radius of the mean mass in the bin considered ( see e.g. @xcite for a similar approach in the galaxy - dark matter cross - correlation ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath171 and @xmath172 are the lower and upper bounds of the bin , we can write @xmath173 \\times w(r|r_{vir})\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath174 is the virial radius of the mean mass between @xmath171 and @xmath172 which is used as a typical cut - off scale of the 2-halo cross - correlation signal here .",
    "@xmath175 is a window function equal to @xmath61 if @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178 .    the curves in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ crossfig2 ] account for this effect .",
    "the signal near the transition between the 1- and 2-halo terms is reduced by @xmath179 due to halo exclusion .",
    "the heavy dashed line shows the total 2-halo term between @xmath169 and @xmath170 , taking halo exclusion into account .",
    "the curve tends to zero at a scale corresponding to the virial radius of a @xmath180 halo .",
    "the 2-halo term integrals have been divided into different bins , for each of which we assign a cut - off scale corresponding to the virial radius of a mean halo . to estimate the total signal from haloes between @xmath169 and @xmath170 we sum the contributions from the individual mass bins . in the clump - mass cross - correlation",
    ", we ignore the halo exclusion since the transition between the 1- and the 2-halo contributions occurs at larger scales , hence the exclusion will not change the signal at all .",
    "we have shown how the halo - model formalism can be extended to account for scatter in halo concentration at fixed mass , and for the presence of substructures in dark matter haloes .",
    "differences in the mass - concentration relation do affect the predicted non - linear power spectrum .",
    "we quantified this by considering three models for the @xmath12-@xmath112 relation , as well as a deterministic and a stochastic models for the concentration at fixed mass .",
    "accounting for substructure means that the 1-halo and 2-halo terms should be written as sums of four and three types of pairs , respectively .",
    "if one uses realistic models for these different pair - types , then the halo model calculation is in reasonable agreement with the non - linear power spectrum measured in the millennium simulation , over a range of redshifts .",
    "the cross - correlation between halos and mass can also be estimated using the halo - model formalism .",
    "we have shown how , also in this case , substructures can be taken into account and how the cross - correlation signal between clumps and mass can be split into different contributions .    the agreement with simulations is not yet at the percent level , so there is room for improvement .",
    "the simulations show an excess at around @xmath181 relative to our model  this is almost certainly not due problems with our substructure calculation , since it is on larger scales than those on which substructures dominate .",
    "the discrepancy is also unlikely to be due to our decision to ignore ` assembly bias ' effects .",
    "rather it may be due to the fact that our 2-halo term is too crude  on these smaller scales , one must include the effects of nonlinear bias , perhaps following @xcite .    *",
    "our formulation of the halo model assumes that the mass fraction in substructures is a deterministic function of the halo concentration : in practice , there is a distribution of @xmath129 values at fixed @xmath112 and @xmath12 .",
    "allowing for this stochasticity simply adds one more integral in most of our expressions , that can matter at the percent level on the small scales of interest here ( for essentially the same reason that scatter in @xmath112 and fixed @xmath12 matters at the ten percent level on small scales ) .",
    "* we only include some of the effects of the known correlation between subhalo concentration and distance from the center of the host .",
    "specifically , our current implementation accounts for the fact that the spatial dependence means subhalo concentrations ( at fixed mass ) are stochastic , but it does not include the fact that this is correlated with distance from host halo center . implementing a spatially dependent concentration is difficult in fourier space , so doing so in configuration is probably the best way forward .",
    "* we also do not account for the fact that subhalos themselves have substructure .",
    "this will matter most for the contribution which comes from pairs which are in the same subhalo ( for the same reason that substructure is not important for the 2-halo term ) . * halo exclusion matters for the cross - correlation signal .",
    "there are exclusion effects associated with the subhalos too , which we currently ignore . *",
    "although the sum of the smooth and clumpy components should give an nfw profile , our current implementation assumes the smooth component follows and nfw profile , whereas the clumpy one does not .",
    "hence there is no guarantee that the sum of the two actually is nfw at high precision .",
    "while this is relatively easy to fix ( simply define the profile of the smooth component to be the required nfw minus the clumpy component ) , we have not done so . * and finally ,",
    "at this level of precision , halo shapes also matter .",
    "in particular , the distribution of @xmath129 and @xmath112 at fixed @xmath12 may depend on halo shape  once this has been quantified in simulations , it may become necessary to extend our formalism to include shapes .    the formalism presented in this paper",
    "can be used in subsequent studies to make more realistic predictions for the galaxy - galaxy lensing signals and for the lensing convergence power spectrum . by identifying the different contributions due to the smooth and clumpy components of the dark - matter haloes",
    ", this will also allow us to quantify the contributions the convergence power spectrum not just by different halo masses , but also by different substructures .",
