    "supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) attracts broad interests as a candidate of the physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "it is also a promising candidate for the nonperturbative formulation of the superstring theory @xcite .",
    "although it is important to study its nonperturbative properties for both applications , and one of the most successful nonperturbative approaches for gauge theory is the lattice simulation , however , notorious difficulty of the lattice sym prevented it for long time .",
    "sometime ago there appeared a breakthrough for two - dimensional theories of extended supersymmetries @xcite , ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) ; the correct continuum limit is obtained without parameter fine tunings for most of these models , at least at perturbative level .",
    "pure supersymmetric yang - mills , the chiral symmetry guarantees supersymmetric continuum limit .",
    "recent results are found in @xcite . ]",
    "furthermore it turned out that by combining two - dimensional lattice with matrix model technique ( fuzzy sphere ) @xcite , 4d @xmath9 theory is constructed without relying on the parameter fine tunings to all order in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "( for other very elegant formulation in the planar limit , which preserves 16 supersymmetries manifestly , see @xcite .",
    "this method is applicable to various kind of theories for which lattice and/or fuzzy sphere technique are not applicable @xcite . )",
    "these formulations provide robust ways to test the @xmath10/@xmath11 correspondence , the gauge / gravity duality @xcite and matrix string conjecture @xcite at nonperturbative level . in one dimension",
    ", such a program has been pursued extensively by using a non - lattice method @xcite and the gauge / gravity duality @xcite has been confirmed very precisely @xcite , including the stringy @xmath12 corrections @xcite .",
    "the lattice simulations are also applicable for this system and qualitatively consistent results have been obtained @xcite",
    ". we can expect study of two and four dimensional theories will provide even richer insights ; in two dimensions simulations in this context are already ongoing @xcite and it is urgent to establish the validity of the lattice models at nonperturbative level by detailed simulations .",
    "however there is a possible obstacle for simulations : supersymmetric theories with eight and sixteen supersymmetries suffer from the sign problem @xcite @xcite",
    ". it would be nice to understand why it happens , but it is out of scope of the present paper . ] .",
    "on the other hand , with four supersymmetries ( i.e. 4d @xmath13 pure sym and its dimensional reductions ) , there is no sign problem .",
    "it can easily be seen as follows . in weyl notation , with an appropriate choice of the gamma matrices , the dirac operator is written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are pauli matrices . by using @xmath17 and the fact that @xmath18 is real in adjoint representation , we obtain @xmath19 therefore , if @xmath20 is an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue @xmath21 , @xmath22 is also an eigenvector , with eigenvalue @xmath23 .",
    "they are linearly independent and eigenvalues appear in a pair @xmath24 .",
    "this assures the positivity of the determinant after removing @xmath25 modes .    at discretized level ,",
    "positivity of the determinant can be lost . in zero dimension ( matrix model )",
    "@xcite , there is no sign problem , because there is no need for the regularization . in 1d theory and fuzzy sphere construction of three and four dimensional theories @xcite , by using the momentum cutoff prescription @xcite",
    "the determinant is positive even at discretized level @xcite .    in lattice constructions of two - dimensional sym ,",
    "the determinant is in general complex at discretized level . in sugino s model @xcite for two - dimensional theory",
    ", however , the sign problem disappears as one approaches to the continuum  @xcite ; that is , if one performs the phase - quenched simulation , distribution of the phase factor of the determinant peaks at 1 in the continuum limit .",
    "therefore the phase quench approximation becomes exact at continuum . in this case ,",
    "in addition to the absence of sign , the agreements with analytic calculations in small volume region have been observed as well @xcite by using techniques developed in @xcite . therefore",
    "the absence of the sign is the property of the correct continuum limit , as expected",
    ". numerical studies of this model can also be found in @xcite .    on the other hand , for other two - dimensional lattice models which are supposed to have the same continuum limit , an _ existence _ of the sign problem",
    "has been reported @xcite . in cohen - kaplan - katz - unsal ( ckku ) model , which is equivalent to a model by dadda et.al .",
    "@xcite with a specific choice of parameters , giedt reported that the determinant has a complex phase , and the phase fluctuates violently if one chooses random lattice configurations @xcite .",
    "however the importance sampling has not been performed in @xcite , and hence this result has nothing to do with the continuum limit as the author remarked correctly .",
    "this model was studied later with importance sampling in @xcite where @xmath26 is a complex field , and thus a natural way of extracting physical quantities is different from the original ckku model . for @xmath1 gauge group as in @xcite , this definition is different from a general complex field originally defined in @xcite .",

    "] , where the sign problem was reported as well",
    ". however , it is not clear whether it is a property of the continuum , because they could not evaluate physical quantities because of the `` sign problem '' and hence could not estimate how close to the continuum limit they have reached .    in this paper",

    "we study this system by using two lattice models ( ckku and sugino ) numerically and show the absence of the sign problem .",
    "we evaluate expectation values of some physical quantities and see that the results show nice agreements .",
    "note that small volume behavior of the sugino model is consistent with known analytic estimates @xcite .",
    "one obstacle for the simulation is the existence of the flat direction , along which two scalar fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 commute . in contrary to a theory on @xmath48 , there is no superselection of the moduli parameter in this case .",
    "that is , eigenvalues of scalars are determined dynamically .",
    "therefore , some mechanism which restrict eigenvalues to a finite distribution is necessary for the stable simulation .",
    "in addition , to obtain an interesting dynamical system , having a ( small ) finite region for the eigenvalues is important as well ; if the eigenvalues of the scalar spread so large , the theory would run into the abelian phase , which is just a free theory , the flat direction is lifted and the system stays non - abelian phase ; see @xcite .",
    "this phase is an analogue of the black 1-brane solution in type iib supergravity . ] . in this work ,",
    "we introduce soft susy - breaking mass to scalar fields @xmath49 so that the flat direction is lifted .",
    "it is crucial to control the flat direction for various reasons .",
    "we have just mentioned two of them  stability of the simulation and interesting non - abelian phase .",
    "there is one more ; in order to guarantee the correct continuum limit , the eigenvalue must be smaller than the cut off scale @xmath50 . especially in the ckku model , we can decompose the bosonic field to appear scalars @xmath51 as a log of positive hermitian variables @xmath52 @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the lattice spacing . in order to obtain the tree level action",
    ", one has to assume @xmath55 , expand it in powers of @xmath56 and neglect higher order terms . therefore ,",
    "unless @xmath55 , one can not get to the continuum limit even at tree level .",
    "actually it turns out that one of previous works , whose conclusion contradicts with ours , does not satisfy this condition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : ckku model ] we study the ckku model .",
    "we introduce the model in   [",
    "sec : ckku action ] and then consider a structure of the dirac operator in   [",
    "sec : ckku_zeromode ] .",
    "then we show the absence of the sign problem in   [ sec : ckku_absence_sign ] . in   [ sec : sugino model ] we show the absence of the sign problem in sugino model .",
    "then in   [ sec : ckku_sugino_comparison ] we confirm that two models ( ckku and sugino ) converge to the same continuum limit . to our best knowledge , this is the first result from the ckku model in the continuum limit and shows in fact we can take a supersymmetric continuum limit without any fine tunings . in   [ subsec : giedt ]",
    "we explain why previous works by other authors fail to capture the continuum physics .",
    "in this section we study the ckku model . in   [ sec : ckku action ] we introduce the model",
    ". then in   [ sec : ckku_zeromode ] we discuss the structure of light modes in the model , which is crucial for the analysis of the sign problem shown in   [ sec : ckku_absence_sign ] .      here we consider the @xmath57 gauge group .",
    "note that the @xmath58 part is decoupled in the continuum limit and hence the physics is the same as @xmath1 theory .",
    "the action is given by @xmath59 here @xmath60 are @xmath40 complex matrices and @xmath61 are @xmath40 complex grassmanian matrices .",
    "they are related to the fields in the continuum by @xmath62 the fermion is in the weyl representation and is complex .",
    "hence we study the determinant of the dirac operator rather than the pfaffian .",
    "the dirac operator @xmath63 is obtained by writing the fermion part as @xmath64 , where suffixes @xmath65 refer to color , @xmath66 to spinor and @xmath60 to coordinate .",
    "it is convenient to introduce ( semi-)compact decomposition of the bosonic fields @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 are unitary , @xmath69 are hermitian and positive definite , and @xmath70 from @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath69 can be obtained as @xmath71    a mass parameter @xmath30 gives mass to @xmath57 scalar fields .",
    "the last two terms are not present in the original proposal mass term . ] ; it gives mass only to @xmath58 part of the scalar .",
    "as observed in @xcite , at large volume and/or with periodic boundary condition for the fermion , flat direction in @xmath1 sector is dynamically lifted and nonabelian phase ( i.e. bound state of scalar eigenvalues ) becomes meta - stable .",
    "( it becomes stabler as @xmath72 increases . ) on the other hand @xmath58 flat direction is never lifted , and in the ckku model , it can destroy the lattice structure .",
    "but to stabilize this @xmath58 flat direction we do not have to turn on the @xmath57 mass @xmath30 ; the @xmath58 mass @xmath31 is fine enough .",
    "given that the @xmath58 sector is free and decouples from the dynamics , nonzero value of @xmath31 does not affect the supersymmetry",
    "i n the @xmath1 sector in the continuum limit .",
    "we explicitly confirm this statement numerically ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : wilson_u1massdep ] , [ fig : su_scalar_u1massdep ] , [ fig : un_det_u1massdep ] , [ fig : cos_u1massdep ] ) . note that this decoupling contains a delicate issue . at lattice level ,",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath1 secters are not completely decoupled . in order to stabilize the lattice structure , the heavy @xmath58 mass is suitable .",
    "however , if the @xmath58 mass is too large , the susy breaking effect in the @xmath58 sector becomes large and it might be mediated through the lattice artifact to the @xmath1 sector .",
    "our numerical results support the decoupling in a wide range of the @xmath58 mass",
    ". it would be nice if the decoupling could be explained analytically .",
    "we will show that with non - zero value of @xmath31 the obtained values of the observables are the same as those from @xmath1 sugino model ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ckku_sugino_comparison ] ) , which justifies the treatment of the @xmath58 mass term . at finite volume and finite @xmath72",
    "we need nonzero @xmath30 to completely remove the instability , but at large-@xmath72 we can take @xmath73 and @xmath74 so that the supersymmetry in the @xmath1 sector is fully restored already at finite volume .",
    "it enables one to study interesting finite - volume physics like black hole / black string phase transition @xcite .      at the classical vacuum of the @xmath57 theory ,",
    "the dirac operator has @xmath75 fermion zero - modes , which correspond to zero - momentum .",
    "apart from the classical vacuum , @xmath76 of them are lifted and there remain two zero - modes which correspond to the @xmath58 part . at a discretized level , because of the special property of the ckku model , only one of them is exactly zero @xcite .",
    "the other approaches to zero in the continuum limit .",
    "let us call it the _ pseudo zero - mode_.    in our simulation , the phase quenched ensemble with @xmath77 is used , where @xmath78 . to avoid the exact zero - mode",
    ", we add a regulator term to @xmath79 in the simulation , @xmath80 in practice @xmath81 is fixed to be a small enough value ( @xmath82 ) compared to all nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath83 .",
    "when we calculate the determinant , we remove the exact zero - mode and the pseudo zero - mode by hand .",
    "( in practice we remove one exact zero eigenvalue and smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the dirac operator . ) as we will see , removal of the pseudo zero - mode is crucial to establishing the positivity of the determinant .",
    "the reason is simple  in the continuum , the dirac operator has positive determinant because its eigenvalues form pairs @xmath24 _ after _ removing zero - modes .",
    "the reason why we _ can _ remove this pseudo zero mode is clear ; it will decouple from the dynamics in any case .",
    "the corresponding zero - modes which should be removed in the lattice simulation are the exact zero - mode and the pseudo zero - mode . if the lattice artifact to zero - modes had a pair structure which keeps the positivity of the determinant we would not need to remove these two modes .",
    "however , phase of the pseudo zero - mode fluctuates violently and it dominates the fluctuation of the phase of the determinant because pseudo zero - mode does not appear in a pair ; without removing it the phase of the determinant becomes completely random , just because the phase of the pseudo zero - mode is random .",
    "we numerically calculated the eigenvalues and the determinant of @xmath84 .",
    "we observed that at very small lattice spacing , the other @xmath76 light modes have a pair structure @xmath85 , which is exactly expected from the continuum argument .",
    "as we have explained , it is important to control the flat direction in order to study continuum physics . in fig .",

    "moreover the scalar fields stay finite in physical unit ( the right panel ) .",
    "that is , this lattice model describes a system without the flat direction in the continuum limit .",
    "the obtained continuum system has no instability along the flat direction .",
    "it is expected of course , because we added a mass term .",
    "note that if the scalar converged in the lattice unit but diverged in physical unit we would obtain a continuum limit with flat direction , which is just a free theory in the abelian phase .",

    "this plot uses the same physical parameters as the left panel , but a smaller lattice .",
    "note that for the smaller lattice ( i.e. larger lattice spacing ) more spikes appear at @xmath92 , which is a signal of the instability .",

    "[ fig : wilson_comparison ] , two models give the same result in the continuum limit .",
    "we also compare the size of the @xmath1 part of the scalar fields ( fig .",
    "[ scalar_comparison.eps ] ) .",
    "two models agree reasonably well with each other .",
    "therefore we conclude that the both models converge to the same continuum limit as expected .    before concluding this section ,",
    "let us comment on the flat direction . in",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the flat direction is lifted dynamically at large-@xmath72 , both in the continuum theory and in the sugino model , and the sugino model converges to the correct supersymmetric continuum limit . in this section",
    "we have seen the ckku model converges to the same limit as well , and hence we can expect the same uplift of the flat direction in the ckku model .     the expectation value of the wilson loop @xmath116 at @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the extrapolation to the continuum limit has been performed .",
    "the gauge grope is @xmath96 and @xmath27 , respectively . ]",
    "the extent of the scalar @xmath117 ( contraction w.r.t @xmath34 is not taken ) .",
    "the masses are @xmath87 ( sugino and ckku ) and @xmath88 ( ckku ) . the extrapolation to the continuum limit has been performed . for ckku , only the @xmath1 part is plotted .",
    "the gauge grope is @xmath96 and @xmath27 , respectively . ]",
    "in @xcite it has been pointed out that the sign of the fermion determinant of @xmath118 ckku model fluctuates violently if one chooses randomly generated lattice field configurations . however , as correctly argued in @xcite , it does not mean a problem in the continuum limit ",
    "randomly generated configurations are usually measure zero in the path integral , and hence it is necessary to study the distribution of the phase in the phase quenched simulation .",
    "if the distribution peaks around one ( i.e. determinant is real positive ) in the continuum limit , the sign problem does not exist .",
    "more crucial thing is the treatment of the pseudo zero - mode . as already mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "removing only the exact zero - mode leads to the fluctuation of the phase factor .",
    "the pseudo zero - mode , which should give zero eigenvalue and should be decoupled in the continuum limit , gives non - zero eigenvalue due to the lattice artifact .",
    "since what we want to extract from the lattice simulation is the continuum limit , we must remove a contribution from the pseudo zero - mode when we calculate the determinant .",
    "then we obtain the correct positive determinant .",
    "next let us consider a result from an importance sampling in @xmath119 theory @xcite .",
    "according to the plot in the paper , the distribution of the scalar eigenvalues is large ; the tail of the distribution reaches to @xmath120 .",
    "however , in order for the lattice considered there to converge to the continuum limit _ at tree level _ , the scalar eigenvalues must be of order @xmath121 .",
    "therefore it is plausible that the simulation does not capture the continuum physics . in a simulation of the maximally supersymmetric theory reported in @xcite",
    "the distribution of the scalar eigenvalues is narrower compared to @xmath0 theory , but it is still wide ( larger than the size of fluctuation in @xmath109 lattice in fig .  [",
    "fig : u2_vol=100_m100u000scalar ] ) .",
    "therefore it is difficult to obtain robust statements for the continuum limit unless studying smaller lattice spacing using bigger lattice .",
    "another subtlety is that in @xcite the system is projected to @xmath1 from @xmath57 .",
    "although it is reported that there is no effect to the supersymmetry in this projection , it might have affected to the sign of determinant .",
    "one interesting observation in @xcite for the maximally supersymmetric theory is that the phase is close to one when the gauge group is @xmath27 .",
    "the same behavior is observed also in one - dimensional theory @xcite . in this case",
    "there is no apparent kinematic reason like the pair structure of eigenvalues , and it is not clear if the absence of sign persists in the large volume and/or in the continuum limits .",
    "however , if it survives to some extent , it may allow detailed study of the @xmath27 theory by phase - quench or reweighting .",
    "in @xmath122 theory , it has been reported that a lattice model a la ckku suffers from the sign problem @xcite .",
    "this 8 supercharge system is known to have the sign problem in general so the result itself is reasonable .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the result changes when pseudo zero - mode is removed , although we do not expect the pair structure of eigenvalues in this theory .",
    "in addition , it is not clear whether the flat direction was under control in @xcite , which is an important point to be studied .",
    "in this paper we established the absence of the sign problem in 2d @xmath0 super yang - mills theory on lattice .",
    "we studied two different lattice models : the sugino model and the cohen - kaplan - katz - unsal ( ckku ) model .",
    "we have clarified the structure of the light modes in the ckku model and pointed out the importance of the removal of the pseudo zero mode .",
    "we also confirmed that the both lattice models provide the same continuum physics as expected .    as we pointed out in ",
    "[ subsec : giedt ] , and also discussed in @xcite , in order to obtain correct continuum limit it is crucial to control the scalar flat direction . from this point of view , it is possible that some of the past simulations for two - dimensional super yang - mills theories failed to capture the continuum physics .",
    "it is urgent to check whether the scalar flat direction was under control .",
    "we would like to thank o.  aharony , l.  mannelli and m.  nsal for stimulating discussions and comments .",
