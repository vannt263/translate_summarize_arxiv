    "extraction of energy from a rotating black hole with the aid of magnetic fields has been investigated by many people for several decades .",
    "when a magnetic field connects the horizon of a kerr black hole to remote plasma particles , blandford and znajek ( ) showed that the voltage drop on the horizon of the black hole induced by the rotation of the black hole in the magnetic field is large enough to cause a cascade production of electron - positron pairs to form a force - free plasma around the black hole . as a result , a poloidal electric current propagating between the horizon of the black hole ( the `` battery '' ) and the remote plasma ( the `` load '' ) is produced , which transports energy and angular momentum from the black hole to the remote plasma in the form of poynting flux .",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism was later reformulated and confirmed by macdonald and thorne ( 1982 ) in terms of the `` membrane paradigm '' ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although the original blandford - znajek mechanism was formulated with the assumption of a force - free plasma around the black hole , @xcite showed that the blandford - znajek mechanism also works for an ideal magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) fluid that is not force free . under some conditions the plasma accreting onto the black hole carries a negative energy flux , and as a result",
    "the rotational energy of the black hole is extracted . for a long time",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism has been considered as a promising process for powering the radio jets in active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , this mechanism has also been invoked in models for the central engines of gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "recently , a variant of the blandford - znajek mechanism has been discussed in the literature : the magnetic field is assumed to connect the black hole to the accretion disk rotating around it ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in such a model , the accretion disk replaces the remote plasma ( the `` load '' ) in the standard blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "moreover , because of the rotation of the disk , the disk itself is also a `` battery '' , in addition to the black hole battery .",
    "the two batteries have opposite signs and the direction of the transportation of energy and angular momentum is determined by the net effect of the two batteries @xcite .",
    "when the black hole rotates faster than the disk , its spin energy is extracted by the magnetic field and transported to the disk region . this energy is eventually dissipated and radiated away by the disk , increasing the power and the radiation efficiency of the disk @xcite . when the black hole rotates slower than the disk , the magnetic field transports energy and angular momentum from the disk to the black hole , decreasing the power and the radiation efficiency of the disk",
    "therefore , magnetic fields connecting a black hole to an accretion disk have important effects on the transportation of energy and angular momentum , and the radiation process in the disk .",
    "recent _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations on some seyfert galaxies and galactic black hole candidates have revealed some possible evidences for a magnetic connection between a black hole and its disk and extraction of energy from a kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "for a standard geometrically thin keplerian disk , it is usually assumed that the inner boundary of the disk is located at the marginally stable circular orbit and the torque at the inner boundary is zero @xcite .",
    "this assumption has been justified only for nonmagnetized or weakly magnetized disk flows @xcite .",
    "when the disk is strongly magnetized , the magnetic field may strongly affect the structure and accretion of the disk flow @xcite .",
    "in particular , the assumption of zero torque at the inner boundary of the disk has recently been challenged by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors argued that , when magnetic fields are present , they may be dynamically important in the plunging region between the marginally stable circular orbit and the horizon of the black hole and couple the material in the plunging region to the inner boundary of the disk . as a result ,",
    "the material in the plunging region exerts a torque to the disk at the inner boundary .",
    "the issue is still under debate , however @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite argued that small - scale and tangled magnetic fields  which are often involved in mhd disks  can never be dynamically important . in the presence of an even small but nonzero resistivity , magnetic reconnection will work efficiently to limit the growth of the magnetic field ( see also @xcite ) , so that in the equilibrium state the energy density of the magnetic field is always much smaller than the kinetic energy density of disk particles .",
    "this means that small - scale and chaotic magnetic fields in the plunging region can not produce a significant torque at the inner boundary of the disk .    however , large - scale and ordered magnetic fields have a completely different story .",
    "they are more easily amplified by the shear rotation of the disk .",
    "when the resistivity is small , in the equilibrium state the energy density of the magnetic field can be large enough to be equipartitioned with the kinetic energy density of disk particles , then the magnetic field must be dynamically important and affect the structure and the motion of the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "if in the model of @xcite the magnetic field is interpreted as a large - scale magnetic field connecting a kerr black hole to a disk around it and corotating with the disk inner boundary , then gammie s results showed that the magnetic field is dynamically important in the transition region , extracts the spin energy of the black hole and transports it to the disk .",
    "however , he has obtained a disk radiation efficiency that is only slightly bigger than unity : @xmath5 for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is defined by the ratio of the total radiated energy to the mass accretion rate , @xmath1 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath2 is the specific spinning angular momentum of the black hole .. ] this is caused by the fact that gammie has assumed that the strength of magnetic field in the transition region is limited by the disk accretion rate : @xmath8 [ eq .  ( 12 ) of @xcite , where @xmath9 is the gravitational radius of the black hole , @xmath10 is the radius of the disk inner boundary , @xmath11 is a factor @xmath12 . however , this relation crucially depends on the validity of the following steady state equation for a standard keplerian accretion disk ( with zero torque at the inner boundary ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the surface mass density of the disk , @xmath15 is the disk viscosity , and @xmath16 is the mass accretion rate of the disk . as we will see , equation  ( [ vis1 ] ) is not valid any more when there exists a large - scale magnetic field connecting a black hole to a disk .    a large - scale magnetic field",
    "connecting a kerr black hole to a disk at the inner boundary will produce a nonzero torque at the inner boundary .",
    "then , in the steady state the internal viscous torque in the disk is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the specific energy and specific angular momentum of disk particles on keplerian circular orbits , @xmath20 is the disk angular velocity , the function @xmath21 is given by equation  ( 15n ) of @xcite , and the subscript `` in '' means evaluation at the inner boundary of the disk ( i.e. , the marginally stable circular orbit ) .",
    "apparently , when @xmath22 , @xmath23 does not have to be nonzero to balance the internal viscous torque @xmath24 . in the limiting case @xmath25 , the viscous torque in the disk just works to transport",
    "outward the angular momentum that is pumped into the disk by the magnetic connection .",
    "using @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , equation  ( [ vtorque ] ) then becomes @xmath30 equation  ( [ vis2 ] ) is an extension of the standard equation  ( [ vis1 ] ) to the case when the torque at the inner boundary of the disk , @xmath31 , is nonzero . because of equation  ( [ vis2 ] ) [ or , the equivalent equation  ( [ vtorque ] ) ] , the limit on @xmath32 derived by gammie does not apply to the case of a large - scale magnetic field connecting a black hole to a disk .",
    "the relaxation of this restriction allows us to consider the limit of low accretion rate and look for solutions with higher total radiation efficiency : @xmath33 .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the works of @xcite and li ( ) .",
    "we assume that a large - scale magnetic field connects a kerr black hole to an accretion disk through the transition region between the marginally stable circular orbit and the horizon of the black hole .",
    "in addition , we assume that the mass accretion rate is low , but the accretion from the disk can still provide sufficient amount of plasma particles in the transition region so that the mhd approximation is valid .",
    "the magnetic field is frozen to the perfectly conducting disk at the inner boundary and corotates with the inner boundary .",
    "we solve the one - dimensional radial momentum equation , derived by @xcite for the region close to the equatorial plane ( but we expect the solutions also apply , at least qualitatively , to the regions well above and below the equatorial plane ) , for smooth solutions corresponding to accretion flows starting from the inner boundary of the disk and ending on the horizon of the black hole . based on these solutions , we study the effects of the magnetic field on the energetics of black hole - accretion disk system with magnetic connection , including extraction of energy from a rapidly rotating black hole and the influence on disk radiation efficiency .",
    "the geometry of the model is as follow : a large - scale magnetic field connects a kerr black hole to a directly rotating keplerian accretion disk , going through the transition region between the inner boundary of the disk and the horizon of the black hole .",
    "the mass accretion rate is assumed to be low , resulting a sharp density contrast between the disk region and the transition region .",
    "the high - density disk region is geometrically thin , presumably because the magnetic field in the disk region is not dynamically important ( i.e. , the energy density of the magnetic field is much smaller than the rotational energy density of disk particles ) . in the low - density transition region , the magnetic field must be dynamically important due to the low mass density of particles , so both magnetic fields and gases are geometrically thick and they expand significantly in the vertical direction .",
    "possible formation scenarios for this model will be discussed in sec .",

    "[ 5.3 ] of @xcite ] , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the poloidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "since the velocity of disk particles have both radial and azimuthal components while @xmath74the linear velocity associated with the angular velocity @xmath60has only an azimuthal component , generally @xmath60 is not equal to the disk angular velocity @xmath20 even though the magnetic field is frozen to the disk . indeed , since @xmath75 does not have to be smaller than or equal to @xmath76 , the linear velocity @xmath74 can be greater than the speed of light @xcite  hence the name `` pseudo - observer '' used above .",
    "in addition , although the angular velocity of disk particles is usually a function of radius , for a stationary and axisymmetric configuration @xmath60 must be constant along magnetic field lines , otherwise magnetic field lines would wind themselves up in violation of stationarity .",

    "( as @xmath145 approaches unity , the radiation efficiency drops since when @xmath204 the angular velocity at the inner boundary of the disk is equal to the spin angular velocity of the black hole . )",
    "while for @xmath205 , the radiation efficiency is independent of the value of @xmath122 , provided that @xmath206 is large . for @xmath207 , the radiation efficiency is still larger than that of a standard keplerian disk despite the fact the inner boundary of the disk moves out .",
    "this is caused by the nonzero torque at the disk inner boundary produced by the magnetic field , which transports energy from the transition region to the disk .",
    "for @xmath208 , the effect of the growth in the disk inner boundary radius becomes more important , resulting that the disk radiation efficiency becomes smaller than that predicted by the standard disk model .",

    "we have studied the energetics of a black hole - accretion disk system with a large - scale magnetic field connecting the disk to the black hole through the transition region .",
    "the model that we have adopted is an extension of those used by @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ( as well as in @xcite ) , the magnetic field is assumed to have small scales , be advected into the transition region from the disk by accretion , and couple the material in the transition region to the disk .",
    "while in our model , we assume that the magnetic field has a large scale , directly connect the disk to the black hole .",
    "the role of accretion is only to provide a dilute plasma gas in the transition region so that an electric current can exist there . in @xcite , the large - scale magnetic field",
    "is assumed to extend from the black hole horizon to infinity and have a zero angular velocity although the disk has a nonzero angular velocity and the magnetic field is frozen to the disk ( see sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] for the difference between the two angular velocities ) . while in our model , the large - scale magnetic field",
    "is assumed to terminate at the inner boundary of a thin keplerian disk , beyond which the magnetic field is chaotic , has small scales , and is dynamically unimportant .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field is assumed to corotate with the inner boundary of the disk .",
    "we have focused our calculations to a small neighborhood of the equatorial plane , although the material in the transition region must be geometrically thick when the dynamical effects of magnetic fields are important .",
    "it is assumed that the system is in a stationary and axisymmetric state , and in the small neighborhood , where @xmath220 , both the magnetic field and the velocity field have only radial and azimuthal components ( i.e. , @xmath221 ) .",
    "this model is similar to the cylindrical model that is often used for accretion disks , where the cylindrical coordinates are used and every quantity is independent of the vertical coordinate . here we use the spherical coordinates and assume that every quantity is independent of @xmath222which is more appropriate for an accretion flow near the central black hole .",
    "the self - consistency of this model has been proved by @xcite , where it was shown that to the first order of @xmath223 the dynamical equilibrium in the @xmath222-direction is guaranteed . the extension to the regions well above and below the equatorial plane",
    "has also been discussed by @xcite .    with our simplified model",
    ", we find that in the limit of low mass accretion rate , a system with a fast rotating black hole and a system with a slow rotating black hole behave very differently .",
    "for a black hole with @xmath224 , the spin energy of the black hole is efficiently extracted by the magnetic field and transported to the disk region , increasing the radiation efficiency of the disk dramatically .",
    "indeed , in such a case the total radiation efficiency of the disk is unbounded from above . for a black hole with @xmath225",
    ", stationary solutions do not exist if we assume the inner boundary of the disk is at the marginally stable orbit , which leads us to speculate that in such a case the inner region of the disk is disrupted by the magnetic field and the inner boundary of the disk moves outward until a corotation radius ( defined by @xmath226 ) is reached .",
    "when @xmath227 , the disk  which has a very large radius at the inner boundary  has an extremely low radiation efficiency : @xmath228 .",
    "the above results are in great contrast to those for a standard geometrically thin keplerian disk , whose radiation efficiency is always in the range @xmath229  @xmath230 .    the disruption of the inner region of a disk magnetically coupled to a slow rotating black hole can be interpreted by the following fact : when the black hole rotates slower than the inner boundary of the disk , the black hole exerts a negative torque to the inner boundary of the disk , but a keplerian disk can not sustain a negative torque @xcite .",
    "the general consequences of the magnetic interaction between a black hole and an accretion disk have already been explored in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while the calculations presented in this paper confirm those results with mathematics .",
    "note , the condition for the validity of the solutions is @xmath220 , not @xmath231 . for @xmath232 , we have @xmath233 where we expect the solutions are not bad .",
    "this corresponds to an opening angle of @xmath234 around the equatorial plane , which is not a small angle .",
    "therefore , although our calculations are restricted in a thin slab close to the equatorial plane , we expect that the solutions are typical for the whole transition region .",
    "this conclusion is reasonable when the following fact is also considered : the accretion flow has highest density on the equatorial plane so the transportation of mass , energy , and angular momentum should dominantly happen in the region near the equatorial plane .    hence , according to both the general results in the literature and the detailed calculations in this paper , an accretion disk magnetically coupled to a black hole can have a radiation efficiency in a broad range : from an extremely low value @xmath235 to an extremely high value @xmath102 , depending on the spin of the black hole , the strength of the magnetic field , and the mass accretion rate .",
    "this is of great interest since observations show that galactic nuclei at high and low redshifts have extremely divergent distribution in luminosities , from the extremely bright active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at high redshift to the much less active  sometimes not active at all  nearby galactic nuclei , which is certainly not because of a lack of supermassive black holes in nearby galactic nuclei @xcite . in order to interpret the extremely low luminosities of nearby galactic nuclei , people were led to consider models of advection- or convection - dominated flow ( adaf / cdaf ) , and advection - dominated inflow outflow solution ( adios ) ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "our results on the system with a slow rotating black hole suggests a new interpretation for the low luminosities in nearby galactic nuclei : nearby galactic nuclei may have extremely slow rotating supermassive black holes and the inner region of the disks may have been disrupted by a strong magnetic field connecting the disk to the black hole .",
    "apparently , the model presented in this paper has been highly simplified . in a real situation",
    ", the magnetic field should have a more complex structure : the foot points of magnetic field lines should distribute over the surface of the disk rather than all going through the inner boundary of the disk , and some of the magnetic field lines passing through the black hole may extend to infinity directly ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the field lines connecting the black hole to the surface of the disk lead to additional contribution to the transportation of angular momentum and energy between the black hole and the disk @xcite .",
    "the field lines connecting the black hole directly to the plasma at infinity extract energy and angular momentum from the black hole and transport them to remote plasma through the blandford - znajek mechanism , so will affect the evolution of the central black hole @xcite .",
    "clearly , all these effects will affect some of the calculations in this paper , including the total radiation efficiency of the disk and the evolution of the spin of the black hole .",
    "detailed calculations including the above effects are beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "however , we should emphasize that the main results in this paper are more qualitative rather than qualitative , they are accurate only if the effects mentioned above are weak .",
    "the readers should keep this point in their mind to correctly understand and apply these results .",
    "finally , let us briefly comment on under what conditions a large - scale magnetic field connecting a disk and a black hole through the transition region can be formed .",
    "it appears to us that there are three possible ways : ( 1 ) inherited from the progenitor of the black hole and the disk .",
    "for example , merger of a magnetized neutron star with a black hole will naturally lead to the formation of a disk with a large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the turbulent motion [ or , the magneto - rotational instability @xcite ] in the disk region then disrupts the initially large - scale magnetic field , transform it into highly tangled small - scale magnetic fields . the magnetic field in the transition region , on the other hand , may remain being ordered and having large correlation scales .",
    "( 2 ) large - scale magnetic fields may form from small - scale magnetic fields through reconnection @xcite .",
    "the chaotic small - scale magnetic fields in the disk region are carried into the transition region by accreting gases , then form a large - scale magnetic field in the transition region through reconnection .",
    "( 3 ) the chaotic small - scale magnetic fields in the disk region are carried into the transition region by accreting gases , then stretched by the radial motion to increase the correlation length in the radial direction .",
    "imagine that , in the disk region and near the inner boundary , there is a small loop of magnetic field line with a length @xmath236 in the radial direction , where @xmath237 is the half - thickness of the disk .",
    "as accretion goes on , its inner foot ( the foot closer to the inner boundary ) leaves the disk first , then moves to the black hole along with the gas .",
    "the outer foot is still in the disk region and has a distance @xmath236 from the inner boundary of the disk , moves toward the inner boundary with a velocity @xmath238 . assuming that the time needed by a plasma particle moving from the inner boundary of the disk to the horizon of the black hole is approximately given by the radial free - fall time : @xmath239 .",
    "then , the correlation length of the magnetic field in the transition region is @xmath240 if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the sound speed in the disk region , and @xmath243 is the rotation velocity of the disk . for a keplerian disk we have @xmath244 , then @xmath245 leads to @xmath246 in the disk .",
    "interestingly , for a standard keplerian disk we have @xmath247 @xcite .",
    "so , if the disk radial velocity is smaller than that predicted by a standard keplerian disk , then a large - scale magnetic field can be formed in the transition region .",
