    "solitons arise in many field theories and their particle - like behaviour has prompted discussions of their quantum properties @xcite .",
    "recently , some old results of schwinger @xcite have been developed into a useful numerical scheme for calculating the vacuum energy of a soliton at one loop order @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop these ideas further using heat kernel methods and discuss some applications .",
    "the one loop corrections to the soliton energies are likely to be most significant in situations where different classical soliton solutions have the same energy .",
    "this happens in an important class of field theories , where the classical solutions fall into topologically seperate families and the solutions in each family saturates an energy bound .",
    "the prototype for this behaviour was the bps monopole solution @xcite , but similar solutions play an important role in superstring theories @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 model in @xmath1 dimensions is one of the simplest models of this type @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the vacuum energy of the single soliton solution provides an instructive example of the general technique .",
    "a useful comparison can also be made with the @xmath0 model in two dimensions , where the one loop contribution to the path integral from instanton solutions has been obtained analytically @xcite .",
    "the one loop quantum properties of a soliton solution depend on the normal mode frequencies of classical perturbations about the solution . it will prove convenient to impose boundary conditions at a fixed radius @xmath2 on the perturbations in order to obtain a discrete spectrum and then take the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the heat kernel is defined by @xmath4 where the sum extends over the discrete spectrum with values @xmath5 . for large @xmath2 , the normal modes with real @xmath6 approach trigonometric functions of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a constant phase depending on @xmath6 and a set of other parameters @xmath9 .",
    "if no solitons are present , then the normal mode frequencies ( denoted by a superscript zero ) are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a phase that depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "in the presence of the soliton , the real frequencies are given by @xmath12 in the limit @xmath3 , @xmath13 , and the heat kernel can be expressed in terms of the phase shift by @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath16 states can disappear from the continuum in the @xmath3 limit if @xmath17 and the derivative @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the phase shift must be displaced onto a new branch .",
    "furthermore , bound states have their own asymptotic behaviour and need to be added as a seperate contribution to equation ( [ kernel ] ) .",
    "if there are @xmath19 bound states with @xmath20 , equation ( [ kernel ] ) becomes @xmath21 levinson s theorem @xcite implies that the two expressions ( [ kernel ] ) and ( [ kp ] ) are usually identical .",
    "however , in some situations ( including the @xmath0 soliton ) , levinson s theorem does not apply and equation ( [ kp ] ) in the one that must be used .",
    "an important feature of the heat kernel is the well - understood behaviour of the @xmath22 limit in @xmath23 dimensions @xcite , @xmath24 where the heat kernel coefficients @xmath25 determine the one loop ultra - violet divergencies of the theory .",
    "finite parts of physical quantities can be obtained from a regulated heat kernel , @xmath26 the heat kernel coefficients are integrals of local polynomials of the background fields and their derivatives .",
    "explicit results are known for the first few coefficients @xcite .",
    "the first term in the asymptotic expansion is equivalent to the free heat kernel @xmath27 .",
    "a simple comparison shows that inserting the first born approximation to the phase shifts @xmath28 into equation ( [ kernel ] ) produces next term in the asymptotic expansion with the coefficient @xmath29 .",
    "however , the second order born approximation @xmath30 involves a double integral which contains contributions to @xmath31 and higher terms .",
    "the part responsible for @xmath31 can be isolated by taking a derivative expansion and keeping only the leading term .",
    "this allows us to express the regulated heat kernel in terms of phase shifts , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , subtracting the @xmath34th order born approximations to the phase shift keeping only local terms with @xmath35 derivatives and @xmath36 .",
    "the heat kernel can be used to find the vacuum energy of a soliton in @xmath37 dimensions or the effective action of an instanton in @xmath23 dimensions .",
    "the vacuum energy of a soliton in @xmath37 dimensions is given by @xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 is the zeta - function @xmath40 the effective action of an instanton on @xmath23 dimensions is given by @xmath41 .",
    "a proper time cutoff @xmath42 on the lower limit of the integral can be introduced to regularise the theory @xcite . inserting equation ( [ rk ] )",
    "gives @xmath43 the finite part is now in a form that can be evaluated numerically and the pole terms , which depend on the heat kernel coefficients , can be absorbed by renormalisation .",
    "farhi et al .",
    "@xcite have obtained expressions for the vacuum energy in @xmath44 dimensions by subtracting the full first and second order phase shifts .",
    "this corresponds to subtracting an expansion of the heat kernel with nonlocal factors .",
    "such an expansion does indeed exist @xcite , although the local version is sufficient for removing the divergencies .",
    "the @xmath0 model in @xmath1 dimensions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , has a complex field @xmath47 with lagrangian density @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an energy scale .",
    "the solutions to the field equations fall into families characterised by a topological index @xcite .",
    "the single soliton solution centered at the origin can be written @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a constant and @xmath52 is the complex coordinate @xmath53 .",
    "perturbations @xmath54 about the soliton satisfy the equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "there is one normalisable zero mode @xmath58 and the remaining spectrum is positive .",
    "the first heat kernel coefficient for this operator can be evaluated from standard formulae @xcite or by the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite to be @xmath59 .",
    "the perturbation equation separates , and with the decomposition @xmath60 , @xmath61 where the potential @xmath62 the boundary conditions are @xmath63 the potential does not meet the integrability requirements of levinson s theorem @xcite and the numerical solution shows the unusual behaviour that @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "the first born approximation to the phase shifts can be evaluted in terms of bessel functions , @xmath68 .",
    "the sum over @xmath35 is not formally convergent , however the limit @xmath69 is well defined and when substituted into equation ( [ kp ] ) gives the correct conclusion that @xmath70 .",
    "this definition of the @xmath71 limit should also be used for actual phase shifts .",
    "the vacuum energy @xmath72 can be obtained from equation ( [ zh ] ) , with the observation that the first born approximation cancels due to ( [ summ ] ) , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the classical contribution . the integrand is plotted in figure 1 . after performing the integral numerically @xmath75 the energy decreases as the width of the soliton decreases . however ,",
    "if the width of the soliton changed with time , there would be an adiabatic solution of the form @xmath76 , but this solution has infinite action . the value of @xmath51 must therefore remain fixed assymptotically , although it may decrease locally .",
    "the loop expansion parameter for the single soliton is effectively @xmath77 , and so continuing to analysis to more than one loop would introduce further inverse powers of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility that the energy has a minimum at some value of @xmath51 .",
