    "with the recent start of the lhc the hunt for the higgs has recommenced and new limits for the standard model ( sm ) higgs bosons have been obtained excluding various mass ranges between 145  gev and 470  gev @xcite . at the same time , a slight excess of events in the mass window at around 140 gev has been observed .",
    "unlike in the sm , there is a stringent tree - level upper bound on the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs state in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs and @xmath5 is the mass of the sm @xmath1-boson .",
    "this comes from the fact that supersymmetry links the mssm higgs self - interactions to the gauge couplings ( via the so - called @xmath6-terms ) , thus making the scalar potential of the theory rather rigid .",
    "it is well known @xcite that radiative corrections are important in the higgs sector of the mssm . however , even at 2-loop and 3-loop level one obtains on upper bound of @xmath7 gev @xcite for susy particles below roughly @xmath8 tev and a top quark mass of about 173 gev .",
    "if the above hint for a higgs in the range of 140 gev turns out to be correct , this would essentially rule out the mssm , except perhaps for split - susy - like scenarios @xcite where the squarks and sleptons are typically pushed far above the tev scale .",
    "one popular way to resolve this issue is to add additional higgs fields , e.g. , the nmssm - like singlet(s ) @xcite , so that extra @xmath9-term contributions to the scalar potential lift the higgs mass .",
    "another option is to enhance the @xmath6-terms by employing extended gauge symmetries @xcite .",
    "besides the higgs mass puzzle ( assuming the higgs boson exists at all ) there is yet another eminent mass - related riddle in the particle physics , namely , why neutrinos are so much lighter than all other matter particles . in the `` standard '' seesaw picture @xcite this",
    "is attributed to a new very - high - energy dynamics ( often in the vicinity of the gut scale ) which , at low energies , exhibits itself as a dimension - five effective operator giving the sm neutrinos a lepton - number violating majorana mass @xcite . on the other hand , there is nothing really fundamental about such high - energy realizations of the seesaw mechanism as , in principle , variants of seesaw can be implemented at virtually any mass scale ; inverse seesaw proposed in @xcite or the linear seesaw of @xcite are just two examples .",
    "such schemes are naturally realized in the class of left - right symmetric extensions of the sm @xcite based on the popular @xmath10 breaking chains @xmath11 which , however , often call for further extension of the matter sector in order to maintain the near - perfect gauge coupling unification of the mssm @xcite .",
    "a potential problem in this context is that the gauge couplings can easily become non - perturbative well below the gut scale as matter particles always yield a positive contribution to the corresponding beta functions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one can still devise models where an extended gauge symmetry can remain unbroken down to almost the electroweak scale and , at the same time , a perturbative unification of the gauge couplings at around @xmath12 gev is retained @xcite .",
    "in such extended models the mssm higgs bosons are often charged also under the additional group factor(s ) .",
    "hence , extra @xmath6-terms contributing to the masses of the neutral higgs bosons are naturally supplied .",
    "this implies that the higgs boson , which is mainly the mssm @xmath13 , can have a mass above the @xmath1-boson mass already at the tree level .",
    "moreover , the additional higgs fields needed to break the extended gauge symmetry mix with the usual two higgs doublets of the mssm , thus affecting the phenomenology of the higgs sector . in particular , the couplings of the mainly @xmath14-doublet - like higgs bosons to the sm particles can get reduced and one can find parameter regions where the lightest mssm - like higgs boson @xmath13 decays into two of the additional higgs bosons , as they can be very light without violating existing experimental bounds @xcite .    in this letter we exemplify this basic mechanism at the higgs sector of a simple extension of the sm featuring a @xmath15 gauge symmetry which gets broken to @xmath16 at energies close to the electroweak scale .",
    "the @xmath17 factor can be viewed as , e.g. , a remnant of a complete gauged @xmath18 symmetry that can be restored at higher energies , thus facilitating a possible embedding into a full gut based , for instance , on an @xmath10 gauge symmetry  @xcite . to this end",
    ", we complement the existing literature in several aspects ; namely , by performing a complete one - loop analysis of the light higgs sector and by checking that the light higgs phenomenology is fully consistent with the current data by inspecting carefully all the relevant constraints from colliders ( in particular , those coming from the lep and lhc searches ) and lepton flavour violation ( @xmath19 ) . in particular , we consider not only shifts in the masses of the lightest higgs cp - even eigenstates but also the changes in their character , i.e. , the amount of the @xmath20 doublet components within , and their implications .    in the next section we present the details of the model focusing namely on its extended higgs sector . working out the relevant mass matrices we argue that the cp - even mass eigenstate most similar to the lightest mssm higgs boson @xmath13 can have a mass above 100  gev already at the tree level .",
    "we also briefly discuss the one - loop corrections to the tree - level situation . in section [ sec : numerics ]",
    "we present results of a dedicated numerical analysis where the complete one - loop corrections to the higgs sector were taken into account .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    ".[tab : fc]the matter and higgs sector field content of the @xmath21 model under consideration .",
    "matter generation indices have been suppressed .",
    "the @xmath22 superfields are included to generate neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism . under matter parity ,",
    "the matter fields are odd while the higgses are even .",
    "the additive charges were conveniently normalized in such a way that @xmath23 and @xmath24 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we checked that in this model , in general , the loops due to third generation sfermions ( in particular the stops ) give the largest contribution . in reference",
    "@xcite it has been shown that in inverse seesaw models also the sneutrino loops can give large contributions . indeed , we find that there can be huge contributions if the neutrino yukawa couplings are @xmath25 or larger as can be seen in figure [ fig : fyuk_1 ] .",
    "the neutrino yukawa couplings are parametrized as @xmath26 with @xmath27 and the structure has been chosen such that one correctly accommodates the neutrino data .",
    "however , we find that the bound br@xmath28 @xcite severely constrains this option as , for large @xmath29 , one gets a large contribution to @xmath30 due to the chargino - sneutrino and @xmath31-neutrino loops .",
    "there are , of course , several ways to tune the parameters such that this bound is avoided .",
    "for example , one can add a non - minimal flavour structure into the slepton sector @xcite or tune the structure of the neutrino yukawa couplings so that very specific values for @xmath32 , the reactor mixing angle , are obtained @xcite .",
    "this implies that , in principle , larger values for the neutrino yukawa couplings are possible , hence rendering the corresponding loops more important . on the other hand ,",
    "making them competitive even to the stop loops already requires quite some tuning @xcite .",
    "in this letter we have discussed the higgs sector of a supersymmetric model where the sm gauge group has been extended to @xmath33 . in particular , we have shown that , already at the tree - level , the cp - even higgs boson resembling the lightest neutral higgs @xmath13 of the mssm , can have a mass well above @xmath34 . at the one loop level , masses of 140 gev and even above",
    "can easily be reached .",
    "in addition to such an @xmath13-like higgs , one can also have a second light state which , however , hardly couples to the sm vector bosons as it predominantly spans over the sm - neutral components .",
    "we have found regions where the @xmath13-like higgs can decay into two such states which , however , alters the standard search techniques at the lhc . finally , we would like to stress that the general features discussed here also apply to other extensions of the sm gauge group , e.g. , to full - featured left - right symmetric models , provided the mssm higgs doublets are charged with respect to the extended gauge symmetry .",
