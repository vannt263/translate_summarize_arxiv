    "the double quantum dot ( dqd ) charge qubit [ 1 - 5 ] is one of the qubits that are considered to be promising candidates for the realization of the building blocks of quantum information processing .",
    "its two low - energy states are denoted as the local states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which could be controlled via external voltage sources .",
    "there exist some effective schemes to prepare the initial states and readout the final states of the qubit [ 6 ] .",
    "it is also known that this kind of qubit is coupled to its environment inevitably .",
    "therefore , it is believed that the decoherence might be the central impediment for the qubit to be taken as the cell of quantum computer .",
    "hence , finding out the primary origin or dominating mechanism of decoherence for the qubit is a basic task to overcome the difficulty .",
    "the recently experimental realization of the coherent manipulation of electronic states in a double - dot system [ 7 , 8 ] , which was implemented in a gaas / algaas heterostructure containing a two - dimensional electron gas , stimulated a lot of theoretical interests .",
    "various methods have been tried to study the system .",

    "[ 13 ] investigated the decoherence of the dqd charge qubit in a longer time with a numerical exact iterative quasiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) method [ 14 ] , while liang [ 15 ] used an iterative tensor multiplication ( itm ) method [ 14 ] derived from the quapi to study decoherence of a dqd charge qubit in both the piezoelectric coupling phonon bath ( pcpb ) and the deformation coupling phonon bath ( dcpb ) .",
    "they found that the decoherence times of the qubit are shorter than the reported experimental ones when the qubit in pcpb and dcpb .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the decoherence times of the ( dqd ) charge qubit coupled to pcpb , dcpb and the ohmic bath with another method , through solving the master equations .",
    "the model hamiltonian and the spectral functions for the different baths are introduced in section ii .",
    "we then develop the redfield form of the master equation and obtain the decoherence times in section iii .",
    "conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "the dqd charge qubit consists of left and right dots connected through an interdot tunneling barrier . due to the coulomb blockade , at most one excess electron",
    "is allowed to occupy the left and right dot , which defines two basis vectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the energy difference between these two states can be controlled by the source - drain voltage .",

    ", one can investigate the dynamics and then the decoherence of the open qubit .",
    "we also consider explicitly the case in which the behavior of the original spectral function @xmath40  has a simple power - law form for @xmath41 : @xmath42with dimensionless damping strength @xmath43 and a cutoff frequency @xmath44 . on general grounds , the linear low frequency behavior of @xmath45 is expected in basically all condensed - phase electron transfer ( et ) reactions [ 16 ] , and the frequency @xmath46 then corresponds to some dominant bath mode . for its analytic advantages",
    ", we use the ohmic spectral density [ 17 ] by setting @xmath47 in eq .",
    "we also study the case when @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath31ps@xmath50 [ 19 ] .",
    "in this section , we first review the redfield form of the master equation . in an open system , the relevant system is characterized by the reduced density - matrix ( rdm ) @xmath51 which is defined as a trace over all bath variables of the full density matrix @xmath52 @xmath53the equation for the time evolution of @xmath51 can be consequently obtained from the liouville equation for @xmath52 @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{8}\\]]the redfield form of the master equation for the rdm is obtained from eq .",
    "( 8) by implementing a series of perturbative approximations [ 20 , 21 ] , namely , the system - bath coupling is treated perturbatively up to the second order .",
    "the bath is assumed to remain in equilibrium , and then markov approximation gets involved . in the eigenstate representation of the system @xmath55the redfield equation for",
    "the rdm reads [ 22 ] @xmath56where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the relaxation or redfield tensor . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 10 ) describes the isolated system evolution , while the second one represents its interaction with the dissipative environment .",
    "the redfield tensor describing the system relaxation can be expressed as @xmath59with @xmath60@xmath61@xmath62where @xmath63 denotes the thermal average over the bath .",
    "for the hamiltonian defined above , the redfield tensor components by using coherent states can explicitly be expressed as @xmath64@xmath65where @xmath66 are the system eigenfrequencies , @xmath67 is the distribution function for bosons , @xmath68 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath69 is the temperature , and @xmath40 is the bath spectral function .    to measure effects of the decoherence , one can use the entropy , the first entropy , and many other measures , such as maximal deviation norm , etc .",
    "( for example , see refs .",
    "23 , 24 , 25 ) . however , the decoherence of an open quantum system is essentially reflected through the decays of the off - diagonal coherent terms of its rdm . in general , the decoherence is produced due to the interaction of the quantum system with other system which has a large number of degrees of freedom , such as the devices of the measurement or environment . here",
    ", we investigate the decoherence times via directly describing the evolutions of the off - diagonal coherent terms instead of using any measure of decoherence . in the following ,",
    "we set the initial state of the qubit to @xmath70 , which is a pure state and it has the maximum coherent terms , and the initial state of the environment is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 according to ref . [ 12 ] , we set @xmath74 @xmath31ps@xmath50 , @xmath75 in the calculations .",
    "we then shall use the redfield equation to investigate the decoherence time of the dqd charge qubit .",
    "the analytical expressions of the elements of the rdm we obtained are @xmath76@xmath77@xmath78@xmath79where @xmath80 .",
    "note that by substituting the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 , @xmath43 and @xmath69 , in pcpb , dcpb and ohmic bath into the above expressions , we can readily plot the evolutions of the @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 ) .",
    "the evolutions of the coherent elements of the rdm of the dqd charge qubit in pcpb and dcpb with different @xmath87 are plotted in figs . 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "and when the environment is modeled with ohmic bath the evolution of the coherent elements of the rdm is plotted in fig .",
    "3 as damping strength @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90.@xmath91it is shown that the decoherence times of the qubit decreases as the @xmath92 increases in pcpb and dcpb models . and the decoherence time of the qubit decreases as the damping strength @xmath43 in the ohmic bath model increases . from figs . 1 - 3",
    ", we see that the decoherence times of the dqd charge qubit in pcpb and dcpb are much shorter than the experimentally suggested result , which is in agreement with the results of refs.[13 , 15 ] . however , if we choose the environment as the ohmic bath , the decoherence time of the qubit agrees with the experimental result when we choose a suitable coupling coefficient of the qubit to the environment .",
    "moreover , we also consider the evolutions of the coherent term at different temperatures when the bath is modeled by pcpb , dcpb and ohmic bath separately , which are plotted in figs . 4 , 5 . and 6 , respectively.@xmath93it is shown that the decoherence times decreases as the temperature increases no matter which bath is used to model the environment when @xmath92  ( in pcpb and dcpb ) and @xmath43 ( in ohmic bath ) are fixed , this is physically reasonable .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the decoherence times of a double quantum dot ( dqd ) charge qubit when it is coupled to different baths by using the redfield equation method .",
    "our results show that the qubits have shorter decoherence times than the experimental ones as the environment is modeled by the acoustic phonon baths , which agrees with previous reports . moreover , when we use ohmic bath model the environment with the coupling coefficient of the qubit to the environment properly chosen , the decoherence time of the qubit is in well agreement with the experimental result .",
