    "it is known that expectation values of the two - quark qcd operators @xmath2 give the total number of quarks and antiquarks in a hadron under certain reasonable assumptions @xcite .",
    "the motivation for studies of the expectation values of the four - quark operators in hadrons is that they carry information about the correlation of @xmath2 pairs .",
    "these expectation values in nucleons determine the coefficients of the next - to - leading order operators of deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "one more reason is the manifestation of such operators in qcd sum rules in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the lack of data on the expectation values of these operators became one of the main obstacles for further development of this approach .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations of these expectation values require some model assumptions on the quark structure of the nucleon . as it stands now , the only calculation of the four - quark condensates in the nucleon is the one carried out by celenza et al .",
    "@xcite for the scalar case in the framework of the nambu and jona - lasinio model @xcite under certain additional assumptions .",
    "also , some constraints on the values were obtained by johnson and kisslinger @xcite by analyzing qcd sum rules for nucleons and isobars .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the expectation values of the four - quark condensates in nucleons by using elements of the perturbative chiral quark model ( pcqm ) .",
    "the chiral quark model , originally suggested in @xcite , was fully set up in @xcite . in the pcqm",
    "the nucleon is treated as a system of relativistic valence quarks moving in an effective static field .",
    "in addition , the valence quarks are supplemented by a perturbative cloud of pseudoscalar mesons as dictated by chiral symmetry requirements . in the current paper",
    "we restrict to the simplest su(2 ) version of the pcqm , which includes only pions .",
    "to facilitate the evaluation of the four - quark operators we resort to previously derived results @xcite , such as nucleon wave function renormalization and self - energy contributions , which are used as an input in the present derivation .",
    "although we do not apply the full perturbative machinery of the pcqm , as laid out in @xcite , the present evaluation serves as a first indication for the values of the four - quark condensates .",
    "we calculate the expectation values of the four - quark operators as the matrix elements of the pcqm nucleon . in general",
    "the qcd operators @xmath3 act on the valence and the sea quarks .",
    "we approximate the averaging over the valence quarks by averaging over the pcqm constituent quarks and also approximate the averaging over the sea quarks by averaging over the pions . in the original formulation of the pcqm",
    "the pions were treated as separate degrees of freedom , without taking into account their quark structure .",
    "actually , in @xcite the sigma - term was calculated in the framework of pcqm , with the pions determining the sea - quark contribution .",
    "we shall employ an additional extension of the pcqm , considering the pions as physical particles with their quark contents being determined by qcd . in this approach",
    "we therefore obtain the excess of the four - quark operator expectation value over the one of the vacuum in the nucleon volume .    in the following",
    "we calculate the expectation values @xmath4 of the four - quark operators of light quarks @xmath5 here @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the matrices acting on the lorentz indices , @xmath8 denote qcd quark operators with @xmath9 standing for the flavor .",
    "the dots denote the normal ordering of the operators , @xmath10 represent the color indices .",
    "we calculate the condensates for the basic @xmath11 matrices @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the dirac matrices , that is we consider the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , pseudovector ( axial ) and tensor cases .",
    "we also obtain the results for the mixed condensate @xmath14 which is important in applications .",
    "these are three types of contributions to @xmath15 in our approach .",
    "all four operators @xmath3 can act on the constituent quarks , providing the term @xmath16 .",
    "also , four operators can act on the pions providing the term @xmath17 .",
    "there is also a possibility that two of the operators act on the constituent quarks while the other two act on the pions . denoting the last term as @xmath18",
    ", we present the expectation values as @xmath19 in appendix a we show how these contributions manifest themselves in the pcqm formalism .    to simplify the notations we introduce @xmath20 with a similar convention for the other functions ( @xmath21 ) involved .",
    "while the four - quark condensates are lorentz scalars in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels , they have a more complicated structure in the case of the vector and axial channels : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the momentum of the nucleon , while @xmath24 denotes the nucleon mass . also , in the tensor channel we have @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xmath27 we shall denote the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 corresponding to the contributions @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 by the lower indices , i.e. @xmath33 , etc .",
    "we approximate the averaging of the operator @xmath34 over the valence quarks by the expectation values of the products of the constituent quark operators @xmath35 averaged over the renormalized constituent quark pcqm states .",
    "due to the normal ordering of the operators they should act on two different quarks .",
    "the expectation value is proportional to the probability to find the two constituent quarks at the same space point @xmath36 with @xmath37 standing for the size of the system of the three constituent quarks ( quark core radius ) , while @xmath38 is the constituent quark wave function .",
    "the factor @xmath39 comes from the four angular wave functions @xmath40 integrated over the solid angle . since the pcqm deals with a quark wave function @xmath41 provided in explicit form , the contributions @xmath16 are also evaluated explicitly .",
    "the effect of the wave function renormalization induced by the interaction of the constituent quarks with the pion provides noticable corrections in the case of scalar and vector structures only .",
    "the averaging of the operators @xmath34 over the sea quarks is treated as the expectation value of these operators in pions .",
    "the distribution of the pion field is assumed to be the one determined by the pcqm .",
    "the pion expectation values where expressed in paper @xcite by using the current algebra technique through the four - quark expectation values in vacuum .",
    "we obtain the expressions for @xmath17 through these expectation values .",
    "however , to obtain the specific numbers , we use the factorization approximation for the vacuum expectation values , suggested first by shifman et al . @xcite . in the factorization approximation",
    "it is assumed that the vacuum states dominate in the sum over the intermediate states . while there are indications that this approximation may be violated in some of the channels @xcite , the factorization was advocated recently in @xcite . under this approximation",
    "the expectation values @xmath17 are expressed by the @xmath2 vacuum expectation values which are known to be @xcite @xmath42 for each of the light flavors with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the mass and the decay constant of the pion , while @xmath45 are the current quark masses . here",
    "we adopt the notations accepted in chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in eq.([5n ] ) @xmath3 stands for the @xmath46 or @xmath47 quark field and isotopic invariance of the vacuum is assumed .",
    "the value @xmath48 gives the characteristic size of the contribution of the pion sea .",
    "thus the contribution of the constituent quarks is expected to be smaller than that of the sea quarks since @xmath49 .    in the `` interference term '' one of the operators @xmath50 acts on the valence quarks while another one @xmath51 acts on the sea quarks . following our strategy , we approximate the corresponding matrix elements by those averaged over the constituent quarks and over the pcqm pion field .",
    "there are several possibilities to insert this four - quark operator .",
    "the operator can connect the pion with any of the constituent quarks of the nucleon .",
    "this contribution ( the `` contact interference '' ) is proportional to @xmath52 which does not vanish for the scalar case only .",
    "thus , only the contributions @xmath53 and @xmath54 have nonzero values which are proportional to the expectation value @xcite @xmath55 however , there is an additional small factor besides the characteristic parameter @xmath56 .",
    "this factor reflects the small probability for the pion and the constituent quark to overlap at the same space point for a nucleon fock state described by the valence quarks and a pion .",
    "the interference process can determine a @xmath57 vertex as well , since the pseudovector and pseudoscalar currents connect the pion and vacuum states .",
    "thus , one can consider the self - energy diagram with one of the pcqm vertices being replaced by the four - quark operator .",
    "that would be the first order diagram in the pcqm @xmath58 interaction .",
    "this `` vertex interference '' leads to a numerically larger contribution , except for the case of the scalar - vector condensate .",
    "the neutral pions provide the contribution to the terms @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the quarks with the same flavor .",
    "the charged pions contribute to the condensates @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "thus , they provide the contributions to all the structures @xmath63 with coefficients defined by the fierz transform .    following the general strategy of the pcqm we include only the lowest order contributions in the @xmath58 interactions .",
    "we also assume that only the ground states of the constituent quarks are included as intermediate states in the self - energy diagrams .",
    "this means that the nucleon and delta - isobars only are included as intermediate states of the nucleon self - energy .",
    "this is a standard assumption of pcqm calculations @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the scalar case in the four - quark pion expectation value a `` disconnected term '' , in which one of @xmath2 pairs acts on vacuum , can be singled - out in a natural way .",
    "this is strongly pronounced in the case of the color - singlet four - quark operator @xmath64 for which @xmath65 the `` internal '' contribution presented by the second term on the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq.([5 t ] ) appeared to be about an order of magnitude smaller then the `` disconnected '' one , presented by the first term . for the color asymmetric operator determined by eq.([2n ] )",
    "the `` disconnected '' terms still provide about @xmath66 of the total pion expectation value .",
    "this leads to the natural presentation .",
    "@xmath67 with @xmath68 for the different flavors , where @xmath69 represents the fully dressed nucleon state .",
    "the factor @xmath70 ( it is @xmath71 for identical flavors ) on the right hand side of eq.([7n ] ) is the weight of the colorless combination @xmath72 in the color asymmetric expectation value defined by eq.([2n ] ) . in the case of the scalar condensate",
    "the sea quarks provide the main contribution .",
    "a large part of it is determined by the disconnected term , related by eq.([7n ] ) to the sea - quark contribution to the @xmath73 sigma term .",
    "the internal contributions , coming mostly from the sea quarks are several times smaller .",
    "the expectation values of the operators with the same flavor @xmath74 in the other channels are also determined mostly by the sea - quarks . for the mixed - flavor condensate @xmath75 the sea quark terms and the interference terms provide contributions of the same magnitude in most of the channels .",
    "the valence quarks provide a smaller correction . in the case of the scalar - vector condensate @xmath76 , and for the neutron",
    "the valence quarks provide the main contribution , while in the proton the interference effects contribute of the same order .    in the calculations carried out below",
    ", we use the values @xmath77 92.4 mev for the pion decay constant and the value @xmath78 mev for the sum of the light quark masses .",
    "latter value , given in @xcite , leads to the conventional value @xmath79 mev@xmath80 at the normalization scale of @xmath81 gev .",
    "this set of values was also used in the paper @xcite . note that in the papers @xcite another value for the sum of the quark masses has been used , e.g. @xmath82mev .",
    "this value was also given in @xcite as one of the possible ones .",
    "both values for @xmath83 are consistent with nowadays experimental data @xcite .",
    "we present the results for the condensates @xmath84 both for proton and neutron .",
    "the values of the @xmath85 condensates are determined by the isotopic invariance relations    @xmath86 @xmath87 while for the mixed flavor condensates we have @xmath88 except for the pseudoscalar case @xmath89 . in the pseudoscalar case an explicit dependence of the interference terms on the current quark masses @xmath90 causes contributions which break the isotopic invariance .",
    "these terms are numerically small .",
    "the results enable to obtain also values for the condensates @xmath91 .",
    "this can be done by using the fierz transform .",
    "we compare the value of the contribution @xmath92 with the value obtained in @xcite in the framework of the njl model under certain additional assumptions .",
    "the values appear to differ by about 70@xmath93 .    for the sake of simplicity we shall use the wording `` scalar '' , `` pseudoscalar '' , etc .",
    "condensates for the expectation values of the operators with the repeated lorentz structures @xmath94 .",
    "thus the `` scalar '' expectation values are rather `` scalar - scalar '' ones , etc .",
    "in this section we calculate the contribution to the four - quark expectation values arising from averaging over the system of three valence quarks . using the results of appendix a we present this contribution by @xmath95 with @xmath96 denoting the nucleon as a bound state of three valence quarks .",
    "our main assumption here is that the matrix element in the rhs of eq.([11n ] ) is approximated by the matrix element of the renormalized constituent quark operators @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath98    the renormalization effects are expected to manifest themselves through small corrections only . as we shall see below , these corrections are of the order of several percent only , except for the scalar and vector structures .",
    "thus , we start with the unrenormalized constituent quark operators @xmath35 in which the pion cloud is not included .",
    "the corresponding contribution    @xmath99    is illustrated by fig.1 .",
    "the constituent quark operators provide a nonzero value while acting on different quarks of the @xmath96 system only .",
    "this is due to their normal ordering .",
    "thus we find immediately    @xmath100    for the neutron .",
    "using eq.([11nt ] ) we obtain expressions for the contributions of the constituent quarks through the wave functions @xmath101 . assuming that the constituent quarks @xmath102 and @xmath103 are described by the same wave functions @xmath104 we present the general expressions for the proton as @xmath105 with @xmath106 here @xmath107 stands for the projection on the symmetric spin state of the two - quark system , while the total antisymmetrization is provided by the color variables . for the condensate @xmath108",
    "we find both for proton and neutron @xmath109 since there are two @xmath110 pairs .",
    "the invariant coefficients of the rhs of eqs.([1 m ] ) and ( [ 1l ] ) can be obtained in a specific reference frame . assuming @xmath111 and @xmath112 to be the three - dimensional indices , corresponding to the four - dimensional indices @xmath113 and @xmath114",

    "the model parameters @xmath124 are fitted to reproduce the value of the axial coupling constant and of the proton charge radius .",
    "we will present the numerical values for the mean value of @xmath37=0.6 fm .",
    "a straightforward calculation provides for the expectation values @xmath125 in the proton @xmath126 with @xmath127 while the value is zero for neutron . for the @xmath128 condensate",
    "we get @xmath129 the details of the calculations for the other structures are presented in the appendix b.    for the structures @xmath130 in the proton we find for the pseudoscalar case @xmath131 while in the vector channel @xmath132 and for the pseudovector case @xmath133 note that @xmath134 since the matrix element of the time component of the pseudovector operator turns to zero .",
    "this is true for the solution of the dirac equation in any effective field .",
    "for the tensor case we get @xmath135 following the previous analysis these values turn to zero for the neutron .    turning to the case of different flavors",

    "the @xmath58 interactions provide the nonzero values of the condensates @xmath144 in the neutron .",
    "this happens since the four - quark operators connect the only valence @xmath102 quark with the intermediate @xmath102 quark of the @xmath145 self - energy loop of the valence @xmath103 quark .",
    "the value is @xmath146 with @xmath147 standing for the contribution of @xmath148 to the self - energy of the valence quark with the energy @xmath149 .",
    "the direct calculation gives @xmath150 .",
    "now we take into account the change @xmath151 of the shape of the single quark wave function @xmath152 , caused by renormalization @xcite @xmath153 with @xmath154    here @xmath155 is the shift of the effective mass of the constituent quark caused by the pion cloud .",
    "the numerical values are @xmath156 , @xmath157 .",
    "the term containing the function @xmath158 provides corrections which do not exceed 3@xmath93 .",
    "this happens due to the strong cancellations of the two terms , composing @xmath158 .",
    "we shall neglect these corrections .",
    "the term containing the dirac matrix @xmath159 mixes the lorentz structure of the condensates .",
    "it provides nonvanishing contributions to the scalar , vector and scalar - vector expectation values .",
    "thus , we obtain for renormalized values defined by eq.([11o ] ) @xmath160 @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "thus , the scalar - scalar condensates are reduced by 16@xmath93 due to the renormalization effects .",
    "the scalar - vector condensate is reduced by 11@xmath93 . also , in the vector case we have @xmath163 reducing the value of @xmath164 by about 6@xmath93 . for the pseudoscalar , axial and tensor structures the corrections are negligibly small and we put @xmath165 in these cases .",
    "now we calculate the contribution of the sea quarks . in the pcqm",
    "the excess of the sea quarks in nucleons over the qcd vacuum sea inside the nucleon volume is contained in the mesons , coupling to the constituent quarks . in the su(2 ) version of the model , which we assume in this paper , only the pions are included . in the framework of the pcqm",
    "this contribution is contained in the next - to - leading order of the model . in other words , it is sufficient to include pion exchange in the one - loop approximation .",
    "the distribution of the pion field @xmath166 is determined by the pcqm quark - pion interaction @xmath167 where @xmath168 represents the su(2 ) doublet of light quarks , while @xmath169 is the effective scalar field .    in the one - loop approximation of the pcqm the pions",
    "are contained in the constituent quark self - energy diagrams and in the diagram , describing the pion exchange between the constituent quarks ( fig.2 ) . the contribution of the sea quarks ( see eq.([2 ] ) ) can be presented as @xmath170 with @xmath171 and @xmath172 standing for the self - energy and exchange contributions of the pions @xmath173 @xmath174 .",

    "@xmath175 was the scalar quark operator @xmath2 .",
    "the rhs of eq.([52 ] ) can be simplified by noticing that in the pcqm the relation for the total energy shifts caused by the self - energy and exchange diagrams @xcite @xmath176 holds also for each pion @xmath116 separately , when limiting single quark lines to the ground state .    using eq.([53 ] ) we present the total pion contribution to the nucleon mass as @xmath177 this leads to @xmath178 for the proton with @xmath179 the coefficients multiplied by the expectation values @xmath180 are determined by the numbers of the quarks which can emit the pion @xmath173 and by the strength of the @xmath181 vertex .",

    "we get @xmath186 the value @xmath187 was evaluated earlier in the calculation of the sigma term @xcite , providing @xmath188    the pion expectation values @xmath180 can be expressed by the vacuum expectation values of the four - quark operators .",

    "the total contribution of the pion cloud to the @xmath200 condensate in the @xmath201 channel - see eqs.([54 ] ) , ( [ 56 ] ) - takes the form @xmath202",
    "@xmath203    in @xcite the pion expectation values were expressed by the ones of the vacuum for all channels .",
    "thus similar equations can be presented for all structures . since only the vacuum expectation values are involved , we find for the coefficients in the rhs of eqs.([1 m ] ) , ( [ 1l ] ) @xmath204 to avoid complicated formulas we shall present the final results in the framework of the factorization hypothesis for the vacuum expectation values .",
    "it is convenient to present @xmath205 with @xmath206 standing for the su(3 ) gell - mann matrices normalized by the relation sp @xmath207 .    in the factorization approximation",

    "the contribution of the sea quarks contains the factor @xmath217 - see eq.([5n ] ) , and we can present @xmath218 here we denoted @xmath219 and the rhs of eq.([55 ] ) turns to zero for @xmath220 .",

    "we now show that in the scalar channel the disconnected terms are separated in a natural way .",
    "we have the result @xmath226    as it was shown in @xcite the expectation values of the scalar four - quark operators are dominated by the disconnected terms with one of the @xmath2 pairs coming from the vacuum .",
    "this corresponds to the approximation @xmath227 on the other hand , the factor @xmath228 in the rhs of eq.([70 ] ) is just the expectation value of the operator @xmath229 in the pion - see eq.([5 m ] ) .",

    "these terms are shown in fig.3a - d . a cancellation similar to eq.(a4 ) takes place for all the operators @xmath527 in the proton , although in the general case the operator depends on the spin variables .",
    "however , the spin dependence manifests itself through the operator @xmath528 with @xmath326 and @xmath529 denoting the two quarks .",
    "since the color wave function is asymmetric , the two quarks compose the spin - symmetric state being at the same space point .",
    "thus , the two - quark spin wave function @xmath530 is the eigenfunction of the operator @xmath528 with @xmath531 .",
    "hence , the four - quark expectation value can be separated as a factor and the cancellation takes place as well as in the scalar case .",
    "similar analysis can be carried out for the operators of the general form @xmath34 .    in the special case of the axial and pseudoscalar operators",
    ", there can be the interference effects in the first order of the @xmath58 interaction .",
    "this happens because the matrix elements @xmath532 have nonzero values in these cases .",
    "thus , the operators @xmath533 determine a @xmath181 vertex @xmath534 .",
    "this causes the `` vertex interference '' contributions @xmath535 @xmath536 with @xmath537 labeling an axial or pseudoscalar .",
    "such terms are shown in figs.3e , f .    in the rhs of eq.(a6 ) we have @xmath538 @xmath539    we assume that the matrix elements of the qcd operators @xmath540 over @xmath96 are approximated by the matrix elements of the renormalized pcqm constituent quark operators , i.e. @xmath541 in the first terms of the rhs of eqs.(a3 ) and ( a5 ) .",
    "the renormalization @xcite means that the shape of the constituent quark wave function is modified by the influence of the pion cloud .",
    "also , we approximate the matrix element @xmath542 in the third term of the rhs of eq.(a5 ) .",
    "except for the scalar case , the matrix element between the two - quark states depends on the spin orientation , containing the factor @xmath543 with @xmath326 and @xmath529 denoting the two quarks .",
    "since the color wave function is asymmetric , the two quarks compose the spin - symmetric state when being at the same space - point .",
    "thus we must put @xmath544 for the value of the spin operator @xmath545 averaged over the spin two - quark wave function @xmath546 of the quarks @xmath326 and @xmath529 .    for the scalar case we find immediately @xmath547 with @xmath548 defined by eq.([14n ] ) , while @xmath549 .",
    "this provides @xmath550 for the proton , with @xmath551 defined by eq.([35n ] ) . for the pseudoscalar case we get @xmath552 leading to @xmath553    for the vector and pseudovector structures we can find in the rest frame of the nucleon @xmath554 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 being the space indices , corresponding to the four - dimensional indices @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "a direct calculation provides for the vector case @xmath555 leading to @xmath556 to determine the coefficient @xmath557 , we calculate the time components @xmath558 and , since @xmath559 , we find @xmath560    for the pseudovector case notice that the time components turn to zero .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath561 for the bispinor entering the wave function - eq.([26 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath562 thus @xmath563 as to the value of @xmath564 , it can be calculated by using eq.(b6 ) . in the pseudovector case",
    "we get @xmath565 by using the properties of the pauli matrices one finds @xmath566 thus @xmath567 leading to @xmath568    finally , in the tensor case we find for the space components @xmath569 and the function @xmath9 can be obtained by using eq.(b14 ) . for the space - time components we have @xmath570 and @xmath571 with the further procedure described in the main text .",
    "in order to calculate the value @xmath572 introduced by eq.([81n ] ) , we must calculate the function @xmath573 - eq.([78 ] ) . for the @xmath46-quark it takes the form @xmath574 changing the sign for the @xmath47-quark .",
    "we present the pion propagator ( [ 79 ] ) as @xmath575 the factor @xmath576 is introduced in order to simplify the calculations by expressing @xmath577 we obtain by doing the integral over @xmath578 @xmath579 with @xmath580 , @xmath581 , while @xmath192 and @xmath37 are determined by eqs.([28]),([81 ] ) and @xmath582 @xmath583 we can evaluate the rhs of eqs.(c5 ) , ( c6 ) by presenting @xmath584 leading to @xmath585 @xmath586    the further calculations can be simplified by assuming the chiral limit @xmath587 .",
    "the integral in the rhs of eq.(c8 ) is dominated by the values of @xmath588 close to @xmath589 .",
    "thus , the integral over @xmath590 is determined by @xmath591 , while the integral over @xmath116 is dominated by @xmath592 .",
    "hence , the factor @xmath593 in the power of the exponent in the rhs of eq.(c8 ) is about 0.12 .",
    "since @xmath572 provides a small correction only , this makes the calculation of this value in the chiral limit @xmath587 reasonable .",
    "calculation of the integrals over @xmath118 and over @xmath116 ( by the substitution @xmath594 leads to eqs.([81 m ] ) - ( [ 86 ] ) of the text .",
    "the integrals over the time component @xmath298 in the rhs of eq.([88c ] ) take the form @xmath595 with @xmath596 . we can present @xmath597 with @xmath598 @xmath599 the integral @xmath600 can be expressed through the contribution of the pole in the upper half - plane of the complex variable @xmath298 .",
    "this corresponds to the negative - energy solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "such terms are neglected in framework of the pcqm .",
