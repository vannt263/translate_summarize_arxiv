    "@xmath0 meson weak decays are very important for testing the standard model and probing new physics .",
    "the two @xmath0 factories have accumulated large data sets while tevatron and lhcb will have even more data .",
    "the main task for theorists is to compute all experimental observables in a reliable way .",
    "this amounts to compute hadronic matrix elements reliably .",
    "there are several methods in the literature .",
    "the earliest is the so called navie factorization @xcite . in this method",
    "the matrix element has no renormalization scheme and scale dependence , so can not cancel the corresponding dependence of the wilson coefficients .",
    "futher more , it can not account for `` nonfactorizable '' contributions .",
    "the generalized factorization @xcite takes into account the one - loop radiative corrections to recover the renormalization scheme and scale dependence for the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "but at quark level , to avoid the infrared divergence , it has to assume the external quarks to be off - shell by @xmath1 .",
    "this results in gauge dependence . to account for `` nonfactorizable '' contributions ,",
    "a phenomenological parameter @xmath2 is introduced and it is assumed that @xmath2 is universal .",
    "but actually @xmath2 is process - dependent .    in order to overcome the shortcomings of the above methods , in 1999 , beneke ,",
    "_ et al . _ ( bbns ) @xcite proposed a new scheme based on qcd . in this",
    "talk , i will concentrate on our work @xcite about the chirally enhanced power corrections and infrared divergence problem and the application of the qcd factorization approach .",
    "my talk is organized as follows : in section 2 , i shall give an simple introduction to qcd factorization .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the chirally enhanced power corrections and the cancellation of the infrared divergence in vertex corrections . in section 4@xmath36",
    ", the application of qcd factorization including chirally enhanced power corrections to the two - body charmless @xmath0-decays is reviewed .",
    "section 7 is for conclusions .",
    "beneke , _ et al . _ ( bbns ) proposed a new factorization scheme based on qcd @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that , in the heavy quark limit ( @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where the short distance hard scattering kernels @xmath8 is calculable order by order in perturbative theory ; the long distance quantities , e.g. decay constants , form factors , light - cone distribution amplitudes are inputs form either experimental measurements or other theory ; @xmath9 is a light meson or a charmonium state , @xmath10 ( contains the spectator in @xmath0 ) is any light or heavy meson . if @xmath10 is heavy ( for example @xmath11 ) , the second line in eq.([eq : bbns ] ) is @xmath12 suppressed .",
    "( 300,100)(0,0 ) ( -50,-405 )    at the zeroth order of @xmath13 , eq.([eq : bbns ] ) reduces to naive factorization . at the higer order ,",
    "the corrections can be computed systematically . the renormalization scheme and scale dependence of @xmath14 is restored . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the `` nonfactorization '' contributions is calculable perturbatively .",
    "it does not need to introduce @xmath15 .",
    "the strong phase is suppressed by either @xmath13 or @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath16-exchange and @xmath16-annihilation diagrams are @xmath12 suppressed .",
    "there is no long distance interactions between @xmath9 and ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath18 includes tree diagram , non - factorizable gluon exchange , e.g. vertex corrections [ fig.[fig : fig1](a)-(d ) ] , penguin corrections [ fig.[fig : fig1](e)-(f ) ] , @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 includes hard spectator scattering [ fig.[fig : fig1](g)-(h ) ] , @xmath19 later on we shall apply eq.([eq : bbns ] ) to @xmath0 meson rare decays .",
    "superficially , @xmath21 @xmath3 @xmath22 is a small number . but in some cases , such power suppression fails numerically .",
    "for example @xmath23 is always multiplied by a formally power suppressed but chirally enhanced factor @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 @xmath25 @xmath28 , @xmath29 are current quark masses , and @xmath30 denote pseudoscalar mesons ) .    in the heavy quark limit , @xmath4 @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath24 @xmath31 @xmath33 .",
    "but for @xmath4 @xmath3 5gev , @xmath24 @xmath3 @xmath34 , no @xmath12 suppression .",
    "so we should consider the chirally enhanced power corrections .",
    "for example , in @xmath0 @xmath31 @xmath35 , dominant contribution to the amplitude @xmath3 @xmath36 , and @xmath37 @xmath3 @xmath38 , so one half comes from the chirally enhanced power corrections .",
    "possible sources of power corrections are : high twist wave functions , quark transverse momentum @xmath39 , and annihilation topology diagrams . in this talk ,",
    "i only discuss the chirally enhanced power corrections from high twist wave functions @xcite .",
    "all the chirally enhanced power corrections involve twist-3 light cone distribution amplitudes @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "if we want to include chirally enhanced power corrections consistently , we must prove that the hard scattering kernels are infrared finite , at least for vertex corrections .",
    "the decay amplitude of @xmath0 @xmath31 @xmath42 reads @xmath43 for the hard kernel @xmath18 in eq.([eq : bbns ] ) , there is no contributions from twist-3 wave function insertion for @xmath44 and @xmath45 operators .",
    "but for @xmath46 , it is subtle ! for twist-3 light cone distribution amplitudes ,",
    "if we use dimensional regularization , the infrared divergences of fig.1(a)-(d ) can not cancel !",
    "this is because the twist-3 wave functions are only defined in @xmath47 @xmath25 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 dimensions .",
    "we need to give gluon a small mass and regularize the infrared integrals in 4-dimensions .    after a lengthy calculation , for the operator @xmath51 ,",

    ", we can see that after summing over fig.[fig : fig1](a)-(d ) , the infrared divergences cancel only when @xmath55 @xmath25 @xmath56 , where @xmath57 @xmath25 @xmath58 .",
    "this is not a surprise because we neglected the contribution of three - body twist-3 light cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) . for the asymptotic form , @xmath55 @xmath25 @xmath59 which is the same for both @xmath60 and @xmath61 meson .",
    "after our work @xcite , bbns @xcite also discussed the infrared divergence problem .",
    "they implemented the equation of motion @xmath62 to show the infrared safety without assuming @xmath55 to be symmetric .",
    "however eq.([eq : motion ] ) is justified only when 2-particle twist-3 lcdas are asymptotic , i.e. @xmath63 @xmath25 @xmath50 and @xmath55 @xmath25 @xmath59 by neglecting the contribution from the 3-particle twist-3 lcdas .",
    "our result is based on a more general situation than that bbns considered .",
    "therefore , bbns result is consistent with ours .",
    "we can prove at the order of @xmath64 that the decay amplitude is independent of the renormalization scale .",
    "we can also prove the gauge invariance when chirally enhanced power corrections are included .",
    "the detailed proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss it here .",
    "now we come to the application below .",
    "now we give the prediction of the branching ratios and @xmath67 asymmetries .",
    "we included the contributions of the hard spectator scattering and annihilation topology .",
    "we also include the chirally enhanced power corrections .",
    "we compute the branching ratios ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath67 asymmetries of @xmath0 @xmath31 @xmath65 : @xmath69 , @xmath35 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath19 @xmath19 ; @xmath0 @xmath31 @xmath66 : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath19 @xmath19 .",
    "all our numerical results can be found in the tables in refernce @xcite . from our calculated resulte",
    "we see that : owing to including the chirally enhanced power corrections , the scale @xmath81 dependence of @xmath68 is smaller ; @xmath68 of @xmath82 @xmath31 @xmath83 @xmath84 ( pure tree ) and @xmath82 @xmath31 @xmath85 ( pure penguin ) are in good agreement with data ; @xmath68 of @xmath86 @xmath31 @xmath87 is larger than data ; @xmath68 of @xmath0 @xmath31 @xmath35 seem smaller than data ; for @xmath0 @xmath31 @xmath71 , if consider di - gloun fussion , we can fit the data ; for @xmath86 @xmath31 @xmath88 , our prediction is much smaller than data ; for @xmath86 @xmath31 @xmath89 , the result is very small , only weak annihilation diagram contributes ; there are large uncertainties from ckm elements , form - factors , annihilation parameters .",
    "but a global analysis can fit the data very well .    for @xmath67 asymmetries ,",
    "the numberial results are not reliable because vertex , penguin , hard spectator scattering and annihilation diagrams can all give imaginary part to decay amplitudes , so strongly affect @xmath90 . because of space limitation , for more detail , see @xcite . for @xmath0 @xmath31 @xmath66 ,",
    "the differences from @xmath0 @xmath31 @xmath65 are : if the emitted meson is vector meson ( vertex diagrams and penguins ) , then the twist-3 wave functions of @xmath91 do not contribute ( power suppressed , so can be neglected ) .",
    "but for hard spectator scattering , even the emitted meson is vector one , there are still twist-3 contributions .",
    "note , there are large uncertainties on @xmath67 asymmetries .",
    "so we can not make good predictions on @xmath90 in qcdf scheme",
