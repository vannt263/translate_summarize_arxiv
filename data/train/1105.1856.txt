    "while the foundations of quantum measurement theory were already laid down in the early days of quantum mechanics , quantitative studies are a relatively recent development  @xcite .",
    "these studies are now driving significant advances in quantum information science and quantum metrology , with major progress initiated by the desire to test bell s inequalities on the one hand , and by the quest for gravitational wave detection on the other  @xcite .",
    "a common aspect of these and related studies is the need to quantify , control , and possibly exploit the quantum backaction of one or a series of measurements on a quantum mechanical system .",
    "an important development in this context is the rapid progress witnessed by cavity optomechanics , which makes it increasingly realistic to consider the use of mechanical systems operating in the quantum regime to make precise and accurate measurements of feeble forces and fields @xcite . in many cases , these measurements amount to the detection of exceedingly small displacements . in this context , _ hybrid systems _ consisting of coupled atomic ( or molecular ) and nanomechanical systems may prove particularly useful .",
    "the robust and scalable infrastructure provided by nems / mems devices , coupled with the high precision measurement capability of quantum gases  @xcite , makes them an attractive combination for sensitive force measurements , as well as for a quantitative study of dissipation and decoherence processes at the quantum - classical interface . as a result ,",
    "there are ongoing experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite efforts toward coupling mechanical systems to atomic ensembles .    -axis .",
    "this setup produces a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field that is detected by the bec .",
    "the bec s long axis is along the @xmath0-direction , the probe light ( red arrow ) is along @xmath1 , and the membrane oscillations are along the @xmath2-axis.,width=259 ]    the system that we consider in this paper consists of a mechanical membrane magnetically coupled to a spinor bose - einstein condensate , an arrangement somewhat similar to a system previously considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . the magnetic coupling , generated via a nano - magnet anchored on the membrane , entangles the membrane to the spin state of the bec .",
    "we may then make an indirect observation of the center - of - mass position of the membrane through a measurement of the spins of the condensed atoms . while such magnetic coupling and concomitant entanglement is possible between the membrane and a thermal gas of spinor atoms ( or even a single atom ) , the bec has two advantages over the alternatives when used as a position sensor .",
    "namely , bosonic stimulation between the atoms leads to increased signal strenth , and two - body collisions are suppressed , giving rise to a much longer phase coherence time when compared to thermalized atoms .",
    "now , the indirect position measurement can be achieved generally speaking in two ways : through a strong , or projective , measurement of the spin state of the bec , or through a weak , or dispersive , measurement of the spins .",
    "an example of the former would be through a stern - gerlach - type measurement . here , the atoms are subjected to a spatially inhomogenous field seperating out the different spin components .",
    "the different spin populations can then be measured via a standard absorptive imaging technique . a likely candidate for",
    "the latter type of measurement would be observation of the larmor frequency through a phase contrast imaging technique , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . since the larmor frequency is proportional to the local magnetic field  which is modulated by the motion of the magnetic domain attached to the oscillating membrane ",
    "it provides a measure of the membrane motion .",
    "either type of measurement of the bec spin can induce a backaction on the membrane , modifying its position and/or momentum in proportion to the strength of the measurement .",
    "the main goal of this project is thus to quantify the effect of using the bec as a position sensor on the membrane and to evaluate the feasibility of measuring the backaction of such a measurement . in the case where the backaction is small",
    "we can indeed use the bec to make ultraprecise measurements of the membrane , and when it is large , it may provide a means to observe the effects of a quantum measurement on a macroscopic object .",
    "so far such a quantum effect has only been observed in dilute and isolated systems such as ultracold gases  @xcite .",
    "due to the scope of this endeavor , we find it convenient to divide our results into three papers . in this , the first paper , we present the experimental setup and develop a simplified hamiltonian to describe the interaction of the membrane and condensate .",
    "we derive a general formulation of the system state after a single or multiple arbitrary measurements of the condensate s spin state , and then present results for specific cases where the measurements are projective .",
    "we show that in principle the membrane can be put into a non - classical state by such a procedure . in the second paper",
    "we extend these considerations to weak measurements , focusing on quantifying the backaction of indirect observation of the larmor frequency via phase contrast imaging . in the third paper",
    "we will exploit the backaction of repeated measurements and coherent control to achieve quantum control of the state of the membrane , allowing in principle the production of squeezed or schrdinger cat states .",
    "because the effects of environmental coupling , i.e. decoherence and dissipation , are critical to coherent control protocols , we will also include these effects in the computations of paper 3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; section ii introduces the system under consideration and derives a model hamiltonian that describes the magnetic coupling of the membrane to the condensate .",
    "section iii discusses the indirect measurement of the membrane center - of - mass position via a strong measurement of the spin of the condensate , assuming that the membrane is initially in a thermal state . in particular , we present the post - measurement wigner function of the membrane and interpret its main features in terms of a backaction parameter .",
    "section iv then turns to the case of repeated measurements on this system , illustrating how a sequence of measurements provides a direct signature of the backaction .",
    "section v discusses the possibility of producing highly non - classical states of the membrane , considering specifically the case where it is initially in a coherent state .",
    "we show that repeated measurements typically leave the membrane in a non - classical state characterized by a non - positive wigner distribution . finally , section vi is a summary and outlook .",
    "some technical details of the calculations and experiment are included as appendices .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the system under consideration consists of a micromechanical membrane of fundamental mode frequency @xmath3 and effective mass @xmath4 , whose center - of - mass is oscillating , perhaps under the influence of a weak force .",
    "our goal is to develop and analyze a quantum measurement scheme that permits us to characterize the center - of - mass motion of that membrane .",
    "the scheme that we envisage involves integrating this membrane into a hybrid system whose other component is an elongated spinor bose - einstein condensate with long axis @xmath0 , see fig .  1 . the condensate is subjected to a static magnetic field @xmath5 along the quantization axis @xmath0 .",
    "the membrane is magnetically coupled to the condensate via a magnetic domain anchored at the center of the membrane .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the magnetic domain is a point dipole located at the origin and polarized along the @xmath0-axis , @xmath6 . the magnetic field due to that dipole is @xmath7 the small spatial variation of the resulting magnetic field along the long axis of the condensate results in a variation of its larmor precession frequency .",
    "as we show in the following , this dependence permits us to characterize the expectation value of center - of - mass mode of oscillation of the membrane .    the zeeman interaction between a single atom in the condensate and the total magnetic field @xmath8",
    "is described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 component of the spin-1 operator , @xmath12 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath13 for alkali atoms . because of the extremely low temperature of the condensate and the relatively small trapping frequencies employed ( order 10  100 hz ) , we will neglect the kinetic energy of the atoms and the trapping potential in our model . as a result of the spatial dependence of the magnetic field , atoms at different positions along the long axis of the condensate precess at different frequencies and dephase over a period of time .",
    "it is this @xmath0-dependent phase difference that is picked up in spin population measurements .",
    "we note that the transverse dependence of the magnetic field also results in an inhomogeneous broadening of the larmor frequency .",
    "the effects of this broadening can be minimized , the more elongated along @xmath0 and tightly confined in the transverse directions the condensate is . in the following we consider for simplicity a condensate that is almost one - dimensional and confined to a region close to @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ". furthermore , close to @xmath17 , i.e. for the fraction of the bec directly above the dipole , the magnetic field @xmath18 is predominantly in the @xmath0- direction provided that @xmath19 , the equilibrium distance between the bec and the membrane , is much greater than the relevant coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in that case",
    "we can ignore the effects of @xmath20 and @xmath21 altogether .",
    "as shown in detail in appendix a , for small displacements @xmath22 of the membrane compared to @xmath19 , the single atom magnetic coupling hamiltonian ( [ hmag ] ) reduces then to @xmath23.\\ ] ] the first and second terms of this expression are independent of time , while the third term , proportional to @xmath22 , varies sinusoidally in time .",
    "we exploit this property by rewriting the magnetic hamiltonian as @xmath24 where @xmath25    by treating the condensate as @xmath26 non - interacting spin-1 atoms under the mean - field approximation and by assuming that the magnetic field acting on the atoms in the detector region is roughly constant , we can easily arrive at the many - atom magnetic interaction hamiltonian .",
    "it is simply @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the annihilation operator for an atom at position @xmath29 ( i.e. it is a schrdinger field operator ) .",
    "the total system hamiltonian of the hybrid bec - membrane system is then @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the membrane hamiltonian , and we have dropped ( and will continue to drop ) the subscript in membrane displacement for compactness , @xmath32 . by explicitly combining both terms of @xmath33 and completing the square for @xmath2 , we express the total system hamlitonian as @xmath34 where @xmath35 which we call the _ backaction parameter _ in anticipation of the following sections , @xmath36 which is simply the larmor precession frequency of the atomic spins , and @xmath37",
    "in this and the following sections , we evaluate the backaction on the membrane of an arbitrary measurement operator that acts on the spin degree of freedom of the bec .",
    "we consider the cases of a single and multiple spin measurements for a membrane initially prepared either in a thermal or in a coherent state .",
    "the analytical expressions provided for the post measurement density matrix ( and subsequently the wigner function ) are for a general measurement operator .",
    "however , to illustrate the backaction effects in an intuitive manner , we consider in this paper the particular case of simple projective measurements of @xmath38 , corresponding to all atoms being in the @xmath39 or @xmath40 state .",
    "while this is not the most likely outcome of a typical stern - gerlach measurement , it does serve as a simple demonstration of backaction induced dynamics .",
    "the measurement proceeds in the following way : at time @xmath41 a @xmath42 pulse is applied to the condensate , preparing all atoms in @xmath43 state . following that preparation stage , the atomic spins precess about the @xmath0-axis until a later time @xmath44 when the spin population measurement is made .",
    "additional measurements can be performed at later time intervals @xmath45 .",
    "further precise details of the experimental setup are presented in appendix d.    equation  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) already gives a clear indication of the backaction of the measuring apparatus  the condensate  on the membrane . as a result of their coupling the membrane hamiltonian is modified from being a harmonic oscillator centered at the origin to one that is shifted by the quantity @xmath46 , indicating that the backaction depends on the outcome of a specific spin measurement . here",
    ", we give an explicit description of the measurement process by evaluating the pre and post - measurement density operator of the membrane , and the corresponding wigner function .",
    "we assume that the membrane and the condensate are initially uncorrelated , @xmath47 and denote the initial density matrix elements of the bec as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the various spin states , @xmath51 .",

    "more interesting are the last two lines in that expression : the second line describes a term - by - term shift in the initial gaussian probability distribution the new phase - space center of each term in the wigner function depends on the spin indices of that term , and it rotates through phase space at the membrane frequency .    as the third line in @xmath74 is imaginary , it results in interference between the terms of the wigner function ( visible below in fig .  [",

    "the physical significance of this interference can be understood from the fact that the initial state of the bec , @xmath43 , is not an eigenstate of the interaction hamiltonian ( proportional to @xmath75 ) .",
    "so , one can think of the condensate as experiencing three interaction hamiltonians simultaneously , one for each of its spin components , and it is the interference between them that leads to the oscillations .",
    "we remark that the oscillations in the wigner function can be seen as long as @xmath76 where @xmath77 .      to illustrate the effect of backaction , we assume the following membrane parameters for the remainder of the paper ( unless stated otherwise ) : @xmath78 rad / s , @xmath79 kg , @xmath80 , and an initial temperature of 4k .",

    "( [ eq : wosc ] ) , in order to observe the oscillations in the post - measurement wigner function , we can either increase the temperature or increase @xmath62 .",

    "note however that for decreasing @xmath19 the simplified interaction hamiltonian  ( [ eq : v ] ) becomes less accurate as the components of the magnetic field along @xmath2 and @xmath1 become more important , so the approximations made in eq",
