    "it was already pointed out by landauer @xcite that the process of bound charges compensation will not only reduce the depolarization energy , but it will also reduce the energy supplied to the system by external electric sources . since the latter energy actually represents the driving force for domain wall motion , one can expect that the appearance of free charges in the system will result in a reduction of local pressure on the domain wall .",
    "this may have a serious impact on the domain nucleation and the sidewise domain wall motion .",
    "the problem of the impact of bound charge compensation on the domain pattern evolution seems to be of special practical interest for ferroelectric ceramics where the appearance of charged domain walls is readily expected whereas the high temperatures used to pole it can promote free - charge screening effects .",

    "the results obtained in the previous sections enable us to draw a conclusion on the imprint behavior of polydomain ferroelectrics .",
    "imprint is a property of a ferroelectric capacitor of exhibiting a higher switching voltage when the switching starts from a state in which the capacitor has been kept for a long time or subjected to light illumination ( see ref .",

    "a popular and widely referred to imprint mechanism , which has been offered by the sandia laboratory group @xcite , is related to free - carrier compensation of charged domain walls .",
    "our analysis presented in this paper suggests that this compensation should lead to one more imprint mechanism .",
    "the key issue of the sandia mechanism , which we will refer to as  trapping imprint \" , is that , if the free carriers compensating the bound charge of a wall are trapped , then the mobility of this wall is deteriorated since now it is to drag with it the weakly mobile trapped carries . since , in typically low - conductive ferroelectrics , an appreciable time or / and illumination is needed for the free - carrier compensation of the bound charge of a wall , this effect will lead to the imprint . in the context of the analysis presented above its is clear that the aforementioned charge compensation will also lead to a reduction of the  thermodynamic \" ( pondermotoric ) force applied to the wall in the switching field .",
    "this reduction , similarly to the above case , can manifest itself in an imprint mechanism , which we will refer to as  force - reduction \" imprint .",
    "one should stress that the performance of these mechanisms can be appreciably different .",
    "for instance , in the case of trapping imprint , if the switching field is applied long enough to let the trapped charges drift with the wall , the imprint effect becomes weaker .",
    "its efficiency is clearly controlled by the mobility of the trapped free carriers ; in the limit of high mobility the effect vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "the force - reduction imprint is clearly insensitive to the mobility of the compensating free chargers .",
    "in contrast to the trapping imprint , one can not cope with this mechanism by using longer switching pulses .",
    "all in all , one sees a possibility to distinguish these imprint mechanisms in real ferroelectric systems .",
    "the impact of free charges on the local pressure on a charged ferroelectric domain wall produced by an electric field has been analyzed .",
    "a general formula for the local pressure on a charged domain wall is derived considering full or partial compensation of the bound polarization charge with the free charge .",
    "it is shown that the compensation can lead to a very strong reduction of the pressure imposed on the wall by the electric field . in some cases",
    "this pressure can be governed by small nonlinear effects .",
    "it is concluded that the free charge compensation of the bound polarization charge can lead to substantial reduction of the domain wall mobility even in the case of the high mobility of the free charge .",
    "this mobility reduction gives to an additional imprint mechanism which may play essential role in switching properties of ferroelectric materials . using this mechanism ,",
