    "galaxy formation is an active field of research in modern astronomy .",
    "large surveys of nearby stars are working to untangle the complex assembly history of the milky way by focusing on detailed stellar abundances and kinematics .",
    "these surveys aim to determine when and where milky way stars have formed , establishing the importance of satellite accretion , radial migration , etc . a more universal theory of galaxy formation , however , requires observations of other types of galaxies ( such as giant ellipticals ) in different environments ( such as galaxy clusters ) .",
    "though the stellar populations in nearby galaxies like m31 can be studied via photometry and low to medium resolution spectroscopy , outside of the local group individual stars are too faint and/or crowded to be easily resolved . in lieu of detailed studies of individual stars ,",
    "extragalactic studies can utilize a galaxy s globular cluster ( gc ) population to probe the properties of the host galaxy field stars .",
    "integrated photometry provides a relatively quick way to determine information about a galaxy s gc population .",
    "in particular , integrated colours should correlate roughly with cluster metallicity , since metal poor gcs are generally bluer than metal rich ones .",
    "integrated photometric studies have demonstrated that nearly every massive galaxy has a gc population that is bimodal in colour ( see , e.g. , @xcite)if this reflects a metallicity bimodality , this indicates that most galaxies host two chemically distinct gc populations , which has major implications for galaxy formation scenarios ( see the review by @xcite ) . however , the degenerate effects of age , chemical composition , and ( most notably ) nonlinear colour - metallicity relationships ( e.g. @xcite ) cast some doubt on the nature of the observed colour bimodalities , and the presence of metallicity bimodalities in most gc systems is still hotly debated",
    ".    the most direct way to determine metallicities of gcs is to turn to integrated light ( il ) spectroscopy , where a single spectrum is obtained for an entire gc .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath7 ) il spectroscopy resolves individual spectral lines , providing detailed abundances for many elements  in particular , [ fe@xmath1/h ] can be determined to high precision ( with random uncertainties @xmath8 dex , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , high resolution spectra require significant observing time , even on 8 m class telescopes , and it is only feasible to obtain detailed abundances for a handful of gcs per galaxy .",
    "for instance , @xcite present abundances for 10 of the 1300 gcs in ngc  5128 @xcite from @xmath9 hours of observations on the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope .",
    "while these studies utilize the best possible methods for studying individual gcs , high resolution il spectroscopy is not suitable for science goals that require metallicities of large samples of gcs ( e.g. for studying bimodalities , radial gradients , etc . ) or for observations of objects that have not yet been confirmed as gcs .",
    "such science goals require determining gc metallicities from lower resolution spectra .",
    "the lick indices ( @xcite ; most of which are in the blue ) have served as useful low resolution age- and metallicity - sensitive features .",
    "recently , however , attention has refocused on the near infrared ca@xmath1 triplet ( cat ) index .",
    "the cat is a set of three strong , singly ionized calcium features at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662  . in individual stars the cat features are easily detectable at moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath10 ) and",
    "are primarily sensitive to metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) . though the cat lines are also sensitive to stellar surface gravity  an effect that renders the cat lines useful for probing the initial mass function in early - type galaxies @xcite well - populated gcs should not have significant population sampling differences , and the cat should be primarily sensitive to metallicity . the pioneering work of ( * ?",
    "* hereafter az88 ) established that the integrated cat strength is correlated with [ fe / h ] in milky way clusters .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained cat spectra of 144 gcs associated with the early type galaxy ngc  1407 ; utilizing the az88 cat strength-[fe / h ] relation , they found several anomalies in the behaviour of the integrated cat .",
    "in particular , the brightest ngc  1407 gcs had similar cat strengths , despite large colour differences .",
    "furthermore , the clear colour bimodality in the gc population was not seen in cat strength . ) , but the shape of the distribution is different from the shape of the colour distribution .",
    "they did not see any bimodality in cat strength when the features were measured on the observed spectra .",
    "] foster et al . also found that the predicted relationship between cat strength and [ fe / h ] varied significantly between stellar population models .",
    "their explanations for these discrepancies included unknown variations in the gc populations ( e.g. as a result of age , horizontal branch morphology , etc . ) or changes in the cat strength / metallicity relationship at high metallicities . without an understanding of how these effects could alter the integrated cat ,",
    "foster et al .",
    "noted that cat studies of unresolved populations could remain `` problematic . ''",
    "@xcite then utilized single stellar population ( ssp ) models to derive a new relationship between cat strength and total metallicity , [ z / h ] . with this relation , they derived cat metallicities for 903 gcs from 11 early type galaxies . comparing with integrated photometry",
    ", they find galaxy to galaxy differences in their colour - cat metallicity relations , which they argue may be due to age or initial mass function ( imf ) differences between gc systems .",
    "the individual gc spectra from each galaxy were then grouped by colour and stacked together by @xcite . this stacking process",
    "improved s / n ratios for similar gc spectra , and supports their earlier findings that the cat strength - colour relationship varies between galaxies . usher et al .",
    "suggested that this could be due to variations in gc age or detailed abundances .",
    "these recent papers have only presented indirect evidence that the il cat tracks gc metallicity , through comparisons with colours , ssp models , and lick index metallicities ( which are also often derived with ssps ) .",
    "of course , @xcite and @xcite could not compare to high resolution [ fe / h ] ratios , because none are yet available for such faint clusters .",
    "this paper presents the first direct comparison between integrated cat strengths and high resolution metallicities since az88 , through observations of m31 gcs . for this type of comparison ,",
    "m31 gcs are preferable to milky way gcs , even though there is more information available for milky way gcs , for two reasons .    1",
    ".   il spectra are easier to obtain for m31 gcs .",
    "milky way gcs are nearby , and obtaining complete il spectra requires scanning across the clusters out to the half - light radii . for optical spectral lines",
    "incomplete il spectra ( e.g. of only gc cores ) can introduce uncertainties in [ fe / h ] of up to 0.1 - 0.2 dex as a result of mass segregation and stochastic sampling @xcite .",
    "m31 gcs are sufficiently small ( @xmath11 ; @xcite ) to obtain a complete il spectrum in a single pointing .",
    "this also ensures that the cat strengths and high resolution [ fe / h ] ratios are from the same stellar populations .",
    "there are more gcs in m31 than in the milky way ; similarly , m31 gcs cover regions in parameter space that the milky way gcs do not . in particular , m31 has bright clusters that extend to higher velocity dispersions , younger ages , and lower [ @xmath12/fe ] ratios .",
    "since the cat calibration on mw gcs has already been done by az88 , it is essential to test the calibration on gcs that are unlike typical mw gcs .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the validity of the integrated cat as a metallicity indicator by directly comparing cat strengths to high resolution il abundances , _ without adopting any ssp models_. the m31 gc cat data are described in section [ sec : observations ] .",
    "cat measurement methods are discussed and explored in section [ sec : measurements ] . with the best measurements of the cat lines ,",
    "the trends with [ fe / h ] are explored in section [ sec : metallicity ] .",
    "the feasibility of cat studies for unresolved , extragalactic gcs is then discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the cat spectra were obtained at apache point observatory ( apo ) and kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) in the fall of 2014 .",
    "targets were selected from the high resolution samples of @xcite , @xcite , and sakari et al .",
    "( 2016 , _ in prep . _ ) ; priority was placed on clusters that were bright , covered a wide metallicity range , and had unusual ages or [ @xmath12/fe ] ratios .",
    "the details of the targets are shown in table [ table : targets ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +      figure [ fig : diffage ] shows offsets from the cat strength - metallicity relationship versus gc age , where the ages are from the high resolution spectroscopic analyses of @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ in prep .",
    "_ ) . down to @xmath5 gyr",
    ", there is no significant trend , suggesting that age has little effect on the il cat ( although the large error bars on the age prohibit any subtle trend from being detected ) .",
    "this may not be true for younger gcs if strong paschen lines begin to contaminate the cat lines and continuum regions ; in that case the c01 cat * index may help to remove paschen contamination .    .",
    "there is no significant relationship between gc age and offset from the best - fitting cat strength - metallicity relation .",
    "[ fig : diffage ] ]",
    "considered as a whole , the tests with these well - studied , relatively nearby m31 gcs have reproduced the indirect calibrations of @xcite and @xcite , at least for the observed metallicity range .",
    "however , these tests have also shown that cat measurements are not trivial , particularly for metal rich gcs with significant line blanketing .",
    "this line blanketing makes it difficult to identify continuum levels , and will become even worse with large velocity dispersions .",
    "nonstandard chemical abundance mixtures ( e.g. for gcs that appear to have formed in dwarf galaxies ) also confuse the cat relation at the low metallicity end .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found several intriguing inconsistencies between cat and colour - based metallicities , which they have attributed to continuum problems and age or chemical abundance differences . with this set of nearby m31 gcs , which have been well studied",
    ", these hypotheses can start to be tested .      in their study of ngc  1407",
    ", @xcite found that the general shape of the cat bimodality ( which was only detected in template - fitted spectra ) did not match the shape of the colour bimodality .",
    "@xcite also noted an excess of gcs in ngc  4494 at @xmath2 = -0.9 $ ] ( determined with their cat calibration ) , which corresponds to a trough in the colour distribution .",
    "b193 s large offset from the best - fitting relation suggests that foster et al.s distribution was affected by line blanketing in the most metal rich gcs , which led to continuum issues and subsequent weakening of the measured cat lines .",
    "if the best - fitting relation in this paper were applied to gcs at b193 s metallicity , they would also seem to pile up at lower metallicities , weakening any intrinsic bimodality with a significant metal rich population . though this problem may be alleviated with more rigorous continuum",
    "fits , it is likely to remain a difficulty for metal rich gcs .",
    "the blue tilt is a photometric phenomenon where the brightest gcs in the blue ( metal poor ) subpopulation appear redder than their fainter counterparts .",
    "there has also been weak photometric evidence for inverse red tilts ( @xcite ) and positive red tilts @xcite , although neither case is very significant .",
    "these tilts have been attributed to abundance variations within the most massive gcs , a hypothesis that is borne out by observations of some mw gcs , e.g. ngc  1851 ( e.g. @xcite ) , ngc  3201 ( hughes et al . 2015 , _ in prep . _ ) , and @xmath13 cen ( e.g. @xcite ) , which have large spreads in many elements , including heavy elements like fe . even monometallic gcs like m15 show large star - to - star variations in mg , which could affect its integrated colours ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the brightest gcs in both subpopulations have identical cat strengths , leading to identical cat - based metallicities despite being well separated in colour .",
    "@xcite confirmed this result .",
    "possible explanations for this behaviour included non universal colour - cat strength relations and chemical or age differences between gc populations . however , it is also possible that the cat strengths of the brightest metal rich gcs could be systematically underpredicted because of continuum uncertainties .",
    "if the brighter gcs are more massive , they will have higher velocity dispersions , leading to more blending of the atomic features  such an effect would also be seen at lower spectral resolution ( e.g. with the mw gcs ; see section [ subsec : othercomp ] ) .",
    "c01 and @xcite explored velocity dispersion and resolution effects and concluded that the strengths of the c01 indices were unaffected by broadening , up to large velocity dispersions .",
    "however , the continuum levels are likely to be affected , which may be difficult to detect in low s / n spectra . similarly , narrow line definitions will be affected by line broadening ; while the c01 indices are unaffected , the az88 definitions may be affected by velocity dispersion .",
    "continuum offsets at a fixed metallicity with increasing cluster mass would indeed be detectable as a negative tilt in the metal rich gcs .",
    "@xcite find no evidence for a red tilt in their stacked spectra .",
    "thus , while the blue tilt could indeed be a result of multiple populations within gcs , a red tilt could be created ( or exaggerated ) by systematic offsets between massive and low mass gcs at the same metallicity .",
    "this could also lead to observational biases when observing faint gc systems where only the most massive gcs are observable .",
    "the tests in section [ subsec : alphafe ] also demonstrated that the detailed abundance mixture does affect the cat strength and the inferred metallicity .",
    "none of the chemically peculiar gcs investigated here are massive enough to create a blue tilt , but the most massive , metal poor gcs are likely to have strong star - to - star variations in elements that could complicate interpretations of the cat strength ( e.g. mg ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most intriguing result from the @xcite analysis is that the cat metallicity - colour relationship does not seem to be the same for all galaxies . in particular , while there is excellent agreement between gcs at intermediate metallicities in all galaxies , certain galaxies have large discrepancies at high or low metallicity . by stacking spectra from gcs with similar colours , @xcite confirmed these cat - colour differences between early - type galaxies .",
    "these differences are driven mostly at the metal rich end , though at the metal poor end differences are seen between galaxies with luminous vs. faint gc systems .",
    "most of the gcs are quite bright , and are therefore likely to be massive .",
    "the results from this paper suggest that care should be taken at the metal rich end .",
    "although @xcite argue that there is no evidence for a red tilt in their stacked spectra ( i.e. the cat strength does not depend on gc magnitude ) , stochastic effects ( e.g. the numbers of cool m giants ) in metal rich gc populations could lead to a spread in the cat strength - metallicity relationship",
    ". fe spreads in the most massive gcs could also confuse cat - colour relationships .    at the metal poor end",
    ", detailed chemical abundances can affect the slope of the cat-[fe / h ] relationship .",
    "gcs that formed in dwarf galaxies and have primordial abundance differences from mw and m31 stars and gcs have lower predicted [ fe / h ] ratios at a given cat strength . while it is unlikely that the early type galaxies host significant populations of dwarf galaxy clusters , they almost certainly host variations in he , c , n , o , na , mg , and/or al .",
    "@xcite propose that these variations would lead to colour differences , but they may also lead to differences in cat strength . with these chemical variations",
    "it is difficult to interpret a gc s total metallicity .    the takeaway message from this m31 gc analysis is therefore one of caution : cat - based metallicities are highly sensitive to measurement techniques , and are likely to become increasingly difficult with higher [ fe / h ] and velocity dispersion .",
    "this paper has presented the first comparison between integrated cat measurements and high resolution integrated [ fe / h ] since the original @xcite analysis .",
    "the m31 gcs used for this analysis span a wide metallicity range , from @xmath2~=~-2 $ ] to @xmath3 , and cover ages from @xmath14 gyr .",
    "the results from sections [ sec : measurements ] and [ sec : metallicity ] demonstrate several crucial aspects of the cat as a metallicity indicator .    1 .",
    "the quantitative strength of the cat lines depends on the measurement techniques .",
    "voigt profiles best fit the lines , though line integrations also work , provided that the line bandpasses are defined appropriately .",
    "template fits to the observed spectra do not introduce significant systematic offsets in the measured cat strengths , provided that the templates cover a sufficient range in parameter space .",
    "the cat line strengths are significantly affected by continuum fits .",
    "continuum fits that rely on continuum bandpasses ( such as the az88 definitions ) will be blanketed by atomic lines in gcs with @xmath2\\ga -1 $ ] .",
    "the most metal rich gcs may have strong molecular features that are contributed by cool m giants ; this contamination may be seen in the tio bandhead at 8860  .",
    "_ it is extremely difficult to fit continuum levels properly in these most metal rich clusters . _ similarly , high velocity dispersion gcs will have atomic lines blended together , further complicating continuum estimates .",
    "if continuum levels are properly fit the integrated cat is an excellent [ fe / h ] indicator , to within @xmath6 dex .",
    "the precise relationship depends mildly on the techniques used to the measure the line strengths and on the specific lines used .",
    "age does not affect the cat line strengths in any of these clusters , which are older than @xmath5 gyr .",
    "detailed abundance mixtures may also play a small role in the derived [ fe / h ] .",
    "interpretations of cat - based metallicities must consider the difficulties in accurately measuring cat strength , the potential biases that may occur from only observing the brightest gcs , and any additional systematic effects that could alter the integrated cat strength .",
