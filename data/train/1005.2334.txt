    "non - radiating motion of extended charge distributions in classical electrodynamics has been known to exist for some time ( c.f . @xcite and references therein , and @xcite ) . on the other hand , for systems with a few _ point charges _ , larmor s radiation of energy at a rate proportional to the squared modulus of the acceleration plagues classical electrodynamics . to construct orbits that do not radiate , and hence are without acceleration ,",
    "a simple option are constant velocity motions , which imply unbounded motion .",
    "along _ bounded _ two body motions supported by mutual action at a distance , we expect acceleration to be needed to change velocities , unless velocities are allowed to change discontinuously .",
    "for example , periodic polygonal orbits with piecewise constant velocity segments have vanishing radiation fields .",
    "here we extend wheeler - feynman electrodynamics @xcite to include motion with discontinuous velocities .",
    "this is a natural extension provided by the variational boundary value problem @xcite .",
    "the resulting extended electrodynamics has several appealing physical features : ( i ) there exists a scalar function ( the finite action @xcite ) , and the condition for a minimizer demands that the partial derivatives of the action , with respect to each particle s four - velocity , be continuous along minimal orbits .",
    "these continuous four - component linear currents are analogous to the dirac - equation of quantum mechanics , thus endowing the extended wheeler - feynman electrodynamics with spin .",
    "this is a feature not present in any other classical electrodynamics of point - charges ; ( ii ) besides naturally including non - radiating orbits , the extended electrodynamics can be shown to lead simply to a de broglie length for double - slit scattering upon detailed modeling @xcite ; ( iii ) the absorber hypothesis , first idealized to hold as an average over an infinite universe@xcite , has no known solutions @xcite for many - body motion in wheeler - feynman theory @xcite with which it is consistent .",
    "here we show that the variational electrodynamics allows a concrete realization of the absorber hypothesis for a two - particle universe , i.e. , there exists a non - empty class of two - body motions with vanishing far - fields , so that we do not need either large universes or randomization @xcite ; and ( iv ) two - body orbits with vanishing far - fields were used in ref .",
    "@xcite to predict spectroscopic lines for hydrogen with a few percent precision . since the speed of light is constant in inertial frames , the equations of motion for point - charges are state dependent differential delay equations .",
    "more specifically , wheeler - feynman electrodynamics @xcite has mixed - type state - dependent neutral differential delay equations of motion for the two - body problem .",
    "the theory of delay equations is still incomplete bellenzennaro , hans - otto but it is known that purely - retarded differential delay equations with generic @xmath0 initial histories have continuous solutions with a discontinuous derivative at the initial time . the derivative becomes continuous at the next breaking point @xcite and progresses from @xmath1 to @xmath2at successive breaking points .",
    "on the other hand , a purely retarded neutral differential delay equation with a generic @xmath0 initial history @xcite can have continuous solutions with discontinuous derivatives at _ all _ breaking points .",
    "if one wants to use the electromagnetic neutral differential delay equations with arbitrary boundary data , solutions with discontinuous derivatives must be expected and accommodated .",
    "surprisingly , this same neutrality is compatible with the recently developed boundary - value - variational method for wheeler - feynman electrodynamics @xcite . for orbits where the acceleration is not defined at a few points ,",
    "the variational method offers a well - posed alternative to define trajectories beyond those satisfying a newtonian - like neutral differential delay equation _ everywhere_.",
    "the variational method involves an integral that requires only piecewise - defined velocities , generalizing naturally to continuous orbits with discontinuous derivatives at breaking points .",
    "our generalized electrodynamics contains the @xmath3 orbits of the wheeler - feynman theory .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , if boundary data are such that the extremum orbit is piecewise @xmath3 with _ continuous _ velocities , the wheeler - feynman equations hold everywhere with the exception of a countable set of points where accelerations are discontinuous ( which is a set of measure zero for the action integral ) . we henceforth define a breaking point as a point where velocity or acceleration are discontinuous . here",
    "we show that continuous orbits with discontinuous velocities are possible minimizers if these satisfy further continuity - conditions .",
    "these continuity conditions are non - local , unlike the conditions for an extremum of the variational methods of classical mechanics , which do _ not _ allow discontinuous velocities .",
    "finally , if the extremum is not piecewise @xmath3 , the variational method defines minimizers that are not described by piecewise - defined - wheeler - feynman neutral differential delay equations ( which are not studied here ) .    to discuss the relationship",
    "to maxwell s electrodynamics it is important to keep in mind that : ( i ) wheeler - feynman electrodynamics is a theory of _ trajectories _ , where fields are only _ derived quantities _ ; and ( ii ) the boundary - value - variational - method defines only a _ finite _ segment of a trajectory , rather than a global trajectory @xcite .",
    "the variational equations along piecewise @xmath3 orbits include the electromagnetic fields in the euler - lagrange equations @xcite , which are used here to give a derived operational meaning to the electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic fields appear as coupling terms of the variational equations and are defined _ on _ trajectory segments by the usual electromagnetic formulae @xcite .",
    "in our generalization we use the linard - wierchert electromagnetic formulae to define fields by extension at all space - time - points for which future and past lightcones fall in the finite segment of the minimizer trajectory . for continuous trajectories with discontinuous velocities , and/or accelerations on sets of measure zero ,",
    "we construct the electromagnetic fields only for points having a future and past lightcone , leaving the fields undefined where the past or future lightcones have a discontinuous velocity / acceleration ( usually another set of measure zero ) .",
    "we further introduce the concept of short - range orbits as localized orbits with far - fields vanishing almost everywhere .",
    "this bears a close relation to the electromagnetic notion of radiation @xcite .     in their original articles , wheeler and",
    "feynman @xcite attempted to derive an electrodynamics with retarded - only fields from the hypothesis that the universal far - fields vanish at all times ( the absorber hypothesis ) fey - whe . here",
    "we generalize the absorber hypothesis @xcite to include fields that can be undefined on sets of measure zero , thus arriving at the _ generalized absorber hypothesis _ ( gah ) that the far - fields vanish _ almost everywhere_. we show that short - range - two - body - orbits _ must _ involve discontinuous derivatives on a countable set of points .",
    "one advantage of our generalization is to include spatially - bounded - globally - defined - continuous - orbits with far - fields vanishing almost everywhere , which we call short - range orbits .",
    "this generalization presents itself naturally as the next option after one shows that there are no @xmath3 localized orbits with far - fields vanishing everywhere .",
    "the short - range piecewise @xmath3 continuous orbits are naturally described by the variational method in the same way as the globally @xmath3 continuous orbits",
    ". however , the former are minimizers inside a larger family of boundary - data , which is the second advantage of our generalization .",
    "this extended class of orbits includes orbits that are limits of cauchy sequences of orbits with far - fields disturbing the universe less and less , i.e. , the vanishing - far - field - limit of the gah .",
    "in this paper we use the word `` minimizer '' meaning a generalized critical point of the variational method , that could be either a minimum or a saddle point .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in section ii we discuss the variational method for piecewise - defined continuous orbits with discontinuous derivatives .",
    "we show that the variational method prescribes a continuous momentum current at each breaking point in addition to euler - lagrange equations from each side of the breaking point .",
    "we discuss how the non - local - momentum - currents can be conserved even in the presence of velocity discontinuities along  sewing chains \" . in section",
    "iii we prove that globally - defined short - range bounded orbits must have discontinuous velocities on a sewing chain of breaking points by giving the general solution to a neutral differential delay equation for the far - fields . in section",
    "iv we discuss the physics of generalized minimizers along with some open questions and differences from bounded orbits to unbounded scattering orbits .",

    "choosing the  initial velocity \" to shoot the final point either requires a velocity discontinuous with the past boundary history _ or _ the trajectory arrives at the final point with the wrong velocity .",
    "the generalization to discontinuous velocities extends the solvability of the electromagnetic - boundary - value - problem to a larger class of boundary value data , which is the second advantage of our extension of wheeler - feynman electrodynamics .",

    "the variational method is a step back from maxwell s equations in the sense of weak solutions . replacing maxwell s equations by the vanishing of the frecht derivative ( [ frechet ] ) along a continuous trajectory with boundaries in future and past yields solutions defined only on bounded time - intervals . from these segments of orbits",
    "one can construct the fields as _ derived quantities _ @xcite . since fields constructed in this fashion involve a retarded and a advanced position , before defining fields everywhere in space we need to extend to a global trajectory .",
    "extension is possible using conditions ( [ mv1 ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) and in general involves velocity and acceleration discontinuities .",
    "it is then tempting to translate our generalized electrodynamic quantities into the concepts of maxwell s electrodynamics , but it must be done carefully ; the derivation of the differential form of maxwell s equations given in @xcite holds only in regions where the extended fields are @xmath63 .",

    "nevertheless , quantities like energy flux and field energy in a volume have a meaning even for discontinuous fields , so that a statistical interpretation could be sought in the case of discontinuous fields ; for example , the generalized flux of the poynting vector is an integral that can be evaluated even when fields are undefined on sets of measure zero . the poynting vector @xmath167 evaluated with eqs .",

    "we have shown that our variational method yields a dynamical system even for limiting orbits with discontinuous velocities .",

    "we have demonstrated five different and important reasons to study orbits with discontinuous derivatives : ( i ) inclusion of bounded gah orbits as short - range orbits ; ( ii ) compatibility with the conservation of noether 's momentum ; ( iii ) compatibility with the neutrality of the equations of motion of the wheeler - feynman electrodynamics ; ( iv ) the fact that the variational method is natural in a space completed to contain orbits with discontinuous velocities ; and ( v ) inclusion of limits of sequences of non - radiating orbits .    the physical need for trajectories with discontinuous velocities",
    "is justified as limiting orbits defined by cauchy sequences of bounded orbits which _ must _ develop kinks in the short - range limit ( i.e. , the gah ) . in ref .",
