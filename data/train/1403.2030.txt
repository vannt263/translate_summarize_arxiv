    "in this paper we investigate the question how elements in bordism groups of manifolds with boundary can be detected using spectral invariants of dirac operators , namely the @xmath0-invariant of atiyah - patodi - singer @xcite .",
    "the corresponding problem for bordism groups of closed manifolds has been thouroughly studied in @xcite and led to the introduction of the universal @xmath0-invariant .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend this theory from closed manifolds to manifolds with boundary .",

    "the @xmath0-invariant of a dirac operator @xmath2 on a closed manifold @xmath3 was defined in @xcite as its @xmath4-regularized signature @xmath5 the sum converges if @xmath6 is large , and the value at @xmath7 is defined as the evaluation of the meromorphic continuation of the sum which happens to be regular at this point .",
    "the @xmath0-invariant @xmath8 is one term in the aps index formula @xcite for the index of a dirac operator @xmath9 extending @xmath2 over a zero bordism @xmath10 of @xmath3 with aps boundary conditions : @xmath11 this formula is the starting point for the construction of bordism invariants of @xmath3 .",
    "these topological invariants are derived not just from a single @xmath0-invariant but from the relation between the @xmath0-invariants of the twisted dirac operators @xmath12 for various geometric vector bundles @xmath13 on @xmath3 .",
    "a geometric vector bundle is a triple @xmath14 consisting of a complex vector bundle with hermitean metric and metric connection .",
    "the rough idea is to form suitable linear combinations of @xmath0-invariants such that the integral of the index density ( which encodes the continuous dependence of the @xmath0-invariant on geometric data ) drops out , and to consider equivalence classes of the values in @xmath15 in order to get rid of the contribution of the index .",
    "a typical example of this idea is the well - known construction of the @xmath16-invariant @xmath17\\in \\r/\\z\\ ] ] for a flat geometric bundle @xmath13 .",
    "the universal invariant of this kind is the analytic version of the universal @xmath0-invariant @xmath18 introduced in @xcite .",

    "must define a selfadjoint extension of @xmath2 by choosing suitable boundary conditions .",
    "another possibility would be to attach an infinite cylinder .",
    "after attaching the cylinder the operator @xmath2 has a natural selfadjoint extension .",
    "if @xmath3 is compact one can interpret the sum as a trace of a function of @xmath2 . in the case with boundaries completed by cylinders",
    "the corresponding trace does not exist on the nose but can be defined using a regularization procedure , e.g. by employing the @xmath23-calculus of melrose or @xcite .",

    "the universal @xmath0-invariant is a secondary invariant for the index of dirac operators .",
    "the novelty of the case with boundaries is that it allows to define tertiary descendants of the index which are secondary for the universal @xmath0-invariant ( see section [ ascsc ] ) .",
