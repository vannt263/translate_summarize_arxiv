    "a galaxy is considered as isolated if it has not suffered any interaction with another normal galaxy or with a group / cluster environment over a hubble time or at least since approximately one half of its mass was assembled . in this sense ,",
    "isolation offers a unique opportunity to identify the intrinsic physical and evolutive processes of galaxies , and then to confront the results with theoretical predictions of galaxy evolution ( e.g. , avila - reese et al .",
    "isolated galaxies are also important as comparison objects in studies of the morphological mix as a function of environment , and the environmental effects on galaxy properties . however , the definition of isolated galaxy from an observational point of view is not an easy task .",
    "karachentseva ( 1973 ) introduced an operational criterion for this definition and constructed the catalog of isolated galaxies in the northern hemisphere ( hereafter cig ) , one of the most extended and used samples for these objects .",
    "the sample contains 1050 galaxies of all morphological types and @xmath8 mag , identified in the photographic palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) plates .",
    "a careful revision of the morphology and general properties of these galaxies in the light of recent , much more detailed observations is highly desirable .",
    "a first step in this direction has been given by sulentic et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter sul06 ) , who revisited the morphology of the cig galaxies by using the digitalized poss ii data , and found some fraction of galaxies having a morphological type different to those reported in the original cig . in this paper",
    ", we are aimed to analyze the cig galaxies in common with the huge galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , a sample that we will call cig@xmath9sdss .",
    "the advantages of the sdss ccd images over previous image surveys in similar regions of the sky are notorious .",
    "among these we mention : ( 1 ) the uniformity in both the instrumental set and photometric conditions , ( 2 ) the homogeneity in multicolor @xmath7 imaging and photometry , and ( 3 ) the high resolution ( 0.4 @xmath10/pix ) of the images .",
    "these advantages are crucial for studying galaxy morphology and structural properties .    because of the sdss large numbers , uniformity , and completeness down to a certain magnitude",
    ", it is an ideal database for the search of fundamental relations between physical properties of galaxies and their dependencies on local and larger  scale environments .",
    "for example , recently park et al .",
    "( 2007,2008 ) used the sdss data for studying the environmental dependence of the observed morphology and other properties at different density smoothing scales .",
    "based on their results , they concluded that galaxy morphology depends primarily on the small scale environment , which may reflect the influence of later evolutionary effects such as galaxy  galaxy interactions , rather than on large  scale environment in which the galaxy initially formed .",
    "a relevant goal of the present paper is the identification of the isolated galaxies that may show evidence of morphological disturbances .",
    "it is possible that the isolated galaxies showing signs of distortions are the recent merger products , at a given large - scale background density , as predicted by park , gott & choi ( 2008 ) .",
    "an important question concerning morphological classification is the correct definition of what is an elliptical ( e ) , lenticular ( s0 ) or early  type spiral ( sa ) galaxy .",
    "these types are the most affected in their definition by saturation , poor resolution , etc .",
    "morales & bieging ( 2001 ) estimated that one  half of e galaxies could be misclassified in the poss plates  based cig catalog .",
    "the existence of true isolated early  type galaxies is in general an important problem in galaxy formation .",
    "our finding of detailed structure in the e and s0 isolated galaxies is expected to provide new tests for the various hypotheses of their formation . have the isolated e galaxies systematic differences from those ones found in groups and clusters ? have they assembled in the same way in both cases ?",
    "similar questions could be asked about the isolated s0 galaxies , whose detailed formation histories are poorly understood .",
    "a few decades back , gott & thuan ( 1976 ) argued that e galaxies were produced by larger initial ",
    "density fluctuations , which would have higher density at turnaround and where star formation ( sf ) would be completed before collapse . such larger initial  density fluctuations would be more likely in a region that would later turn into a high density environment . in the modern context of the @xmath11 cold dark matter ( @xmath11cdm ) hierarchical model , the formation of e / s0 galaxies is also favored in the dense environments .",
    "the models predict a small probability of finding isolated e / s0 galaxies and they should have younger stars on average than their cluster counterparts , as well as assembled their present ",
    "day masses by late major mergers ( kauffmann 1996 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "a complementary analysis of galaxy morphology and gross photometric properties has been introduced some years ago , namely the @xmath6 ( concentration , asymmetry and clumpiness ) system .",
    "this system has been proposed to distinguish galaxies at different stages of evolution ( conselice 2003 , and references therein ) and it provides the possibility to carry out a physical and quantitative classification based on measurable structural parameters .",
    "we present here the measured @xmath6 parameters in the @xmath7 bands for the 549 cig@xmath9sdss isolated galaxies .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes the relevant past work on cig morphologies . in ",
    "3 the image processing scheme and considerations used to reevaluate morphology for the cig@xmath9sdss galaxies are presented . in ",
    "4 a description of our atlas of mosaic images for the 549 cig@xmath9sdss galaxies is presented .",
    "the results of our classification and morphological analysis , and the calculation of the @xmath6 parameters in the @xmath7 bands are presented .",
    "section 5 is a discussion containing a comparison of our morphological classification to previous works (  5.1 ) , a discussion on the bar and ring fractions in spiral galaxies (  5.2 ) , the morphological distortions and formation of isolated e galaxies (  5.3 ) , and the @xmath6 parameters in different bands and their correlations with other galaxy properties (  5.4 ) .",
    "finally , in  6 a summary and the main conclusions of this paper are presented .",
    "the morphological classification as well as the environment of each cig galaxy was originally inspected using the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss i ) images which were based on kodak blue 103ao and red 103ae emulsions . according to sulentic ( 1989 ) ,",
    "the representative numbers in the cig were 168 e / s0 and 883 sa - sm / irr .",
    "the morphological refinement of the cig was gradually carried out as new - quality data in the optical and other wavelengths were accumulated since the poss i era . as the result , for example",
    "about one - half of e s in the original cig were found to be misclassified ( saucedo - morales & bieging 2001 ) .",
    "a detailed review on previous works about the morphological refinement for the cig galaxies is out of the scope of this paper ; for a recent review on this see sulentic et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter sul06 ) . the role of extragalactic databases in collecting and homogenizing data of diverse nature ( from photographic , photoelectric and ccd images ) has been fundamental .",
    "we mention the special role played by ned and hyperleda databases , which will be used extensively through this work .",
    "the morphological content of the whole cig sample has been reevaluated by sul06 , who used the digitalized poss ii data .",
    "poss ii is based on the iiiaj and iiiaf emulsions providing higher contrast and resolution than the previous poss i. their main results concerning the morphological content are : ( 1 ) 82% of the cig galaxies are spirals ( sa - sd ) with the bulk being luminous systems with small bulges ( 63% are between sb and sc types ) , and ( 2 ) 14% are early - type e / s0 galaxies ( the remaining 4% are suspected to be irregular galaxies .",
    "sul06 also reported a considerable number of galaxies in the cig catalog ( n = 193 ) flagged for the presence of nearby companions or signs of distortion likely due to interactions .",
    "those results represent a more uniform and homogeneous reclassification for the whole cig catalog and provide an excellent frame to test the results of our new morphological revaluation for 549 cig galaxies with images available in the sdss ( dr6 ) database .",
    "recent examples of detailed morphological reclassifications for cig galaxies based on optical ccd images , from san pedro mrtir national observatory , and extended to the near - infrared domain can be found in hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "( 2007 ; 2008 ) .",
    "h@xmath12 morphological studies in another subsample of cig isolated spiral galaxies have been reported by verley et al .",
    "the sdss is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey obtained with a mosaic camera that images the sky by scanning along great circles at the sidereal rate ( gunn et al .",
    "the imaging data are produced simultaneously in the photometric @xmath13 , and @xmath14 bands , with effective wavelength bands of 3551 , 4770 , 6231 , 7625 , and 9134 @xmath15 , respectively ( fukugita et al . 1996 ) under photometric conditions ( hogg et al .",
    "the sdss data are reduced by highly automated photometric and spectroscopic reduction pipelines ( see stoughton et al . 2002 ) .",
    "sources are identified , deblended , and photometrically measured ( lupton et al .",
    "2002 ) , and then the magnitudes are calibrated to a standard star network approximately in the ab system ( smith et al .",
    "very recently the sdss team made public their dr6 to the astronomical community .",
    "sdss dr6 covers 9583 @xmath16 of five - band imaging data of the sky and includes spectra , with derived spectroscopic parameters , for 68 770 stars , 790 860 galaxies , and 103 647 quasars .",
    "based on ned and hyperleda coordinates for the whole cig sample , all the available sdss @xmath7 band images ( scale 0.396 @xmath10/pixel ) were retrieved from the sdss archive for a total of 549 entries from cig ( the cig@xmath9sdss sample ) .    to process the images from the sdss ( dr6 ) a procedure that i ) efficiently detects stars , ii )",
    "finds their positions , iii ) estimates the nearby sky background and iv ) replace the stars in the images by a close representative background , was implemented . for this purpose",
    "several routines from the idl daophot package were used . to improve the performance of these routines , the signal to noise ratio in the images",
    "was enhanced by suppressing high spatial frequency image noise .",
    "this task was accomplished by using a small digital low - pass filter ( mighell 1999 ) . after identifying the position of a target galaxy ,",
    "a next stage starts by creating a mask of about two times the corresponding petrosian radius above each galaxy .",
    "the covering area around a target galaxy was set to protect and preserve the local characteristics of each galaxy image while cleaning the rest of the image of field stars . at the same time",
    ", the image sections containing detected stars were substituted by local background values .",
    "mean background is restimated and subtracted from the whole new image and optionally from a section of the image , depending on the position of the target galaxy within the original ccd frame .",
    "the procedure was completely programed within the idl platform by using the routines provided by the idl astronomy user s library which includes daophot . through this procedure",
    "we were able to process thousands of images and repeat the image procedure to find , after trial / error tests , the optimal parameters related to the star subtraction process .",
    "in the next stage , all the images were automatically filtered through a mean gaussian kernel and at the same time , the diffuse background was canceled out following filter - enhancing techniques ( sofue 1993 ) .",
    "a three - component mosaic containing ( 1 ) a clean / sky subtracted and logarithmic scaled @xmath0band image , ( 2 ) the corresponding filtered - enhanced version of ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) the corresponding rgb image , available in the sdss database were used for each individual galaxy .",
    "as a first step of the morphological classification we sorted the sample into e / s0/sa and sab - sm / irr candidates .",
    "next , different kernel values were used to filter and enhance different morphological details in early and late - type galaxies to further proceed with a second classification stage .",
    "the resultant images were used to create 1 ) three - component image mosaics for sb - irr galaxies and 2 ) three - component images plus the corresponding surface brightness and geometric profiles after an isophotal analysis for e / s0/sa galaxies .",
    "galaxy classification is strongly dependent on the quality of the data employed ( s / n ratio and resolution ) and of course , on the wavelength .",
    "we state here our general criteria to carry out such a classification in the @xmath17 band .",
    "we expect to find more detailed and reliable structure because of the improved scale and dynamic range of the sdss database . in order to discuss the optical morphology and its relationship to the global photometric properties ,",
    "we present the 549 cig@xmath9sdss mosaics , each one including 1 ) a gray scale @xmath17-band image displayed in logarithmic scale to look for internal / external details ; 2 ) an @xmath17 band filtered - enhanced image to look for internal structure in the form of star forming regions , bars , rings and/or structure embedded into dusty regions ; for e s this method is useful to reveal fine structure ( e.g. dust , shells , broad tides , etc . ) underneath the dominant light of the galaxy ; and 3 ) an rgb color image from the sdss database to visualize the spatial distribution of the sf and other components like dust ( blue colors for recent sf and red colors for older populations / dusty components ) to complement the structural and morphological analysis .    in the case of e / s0/sa candidates , besides including the processed images , we use the isophote package in iraf to fit ellipses to the galaxy distribution of light .",
    "this package uses an iterative method that starts at a small radius and increases to large radii in a geometrical progression .",
    "the galaxy center , position angle and ellipticity were allowed to vary .",
    "these isophotal shape parameters help define the morphology of the galaxy . for example",
    ", the fourth - order cosine term of the fourier series is a useful parameter to express the deviation from a perfect ellipse due to the presence of additional light .",
    "an excess of light along the major and/or minor axes ( disky ) is indicated by positive values , while negative values indicate excess light at @xmath18 with respect to these axes ( boxy ) .",
    "each mosaic includes a surface brightness profile and the corresponding geometric profiles of ellipticity ( @xmath1 ) , position angle ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 coefficients of the fourier series expansions estimated from the @xmath19 band images .",
    "the classification of the sample follows the basic hubble sequence .",
    "for s types we considered the bulge to disk ratio as judged from the observed prominence of the bulge , tightness of the arms , and the degree of resolution of structure along the arms / outer disk . in the majority of the cig spirals these features are well recognized , however in some cases the presence of structures like dust lanes , prominent knots and the apparent tightening of the arms in the central regions may confuse the identification of inner rings or bars .",
    "outer rings / pseudo - rings ( buta 1995 ) were also identified when possible . while the presence / absence of a bar was confirmed in some cases ( b ) , in the suspected cases we adopted the ( ab ) nomenclature convention . in most of the cases when the inclination of the galaxy is greater than @xmath20 ( see table1 ) we tend to adopt the classification from the literature .",
    "figure 1 illustrates our image procedures and shows 4 s galaxies ( cig 500 , cig 525 , cig 361 and cig 436 ) that where classified according to the stated criteria .",
    "notice how the bulge is relatively decreasing in importance and the arms become significantly fragmented / resolved into clumps indicating , from top to bottom , sb , sbc , sc , and scd types .",
    "some main structural features like bars and rings were identified and sometimes suspected .",
    "each galaxy is identified by its cig number and the corresponding morphological type .",
    "the first row of figure 1 shows cig 500 displayed in logarithmic scale ( left - panel ) .",
    "the prominence of the bulge / bar region and at the same time the smoothness of a not so tightly wounded set of arms are appreciated . the @xmath17-band filtered - enhanced image ( middle panel )",
    "let us appreciate more detailed structure along the bar , ring , and arms .",
    "the filtered - enhancing techniques ( sofue 1993 ) allow the subtraction of the diffuse background in a convenient way to discuss different morphological details . the rgb composed image ( right panel ) from the sdss database complement and reinforces our view of a prominent bulge / bar region and the smoothness of the arms . while hyperleda classifies this galaxy as @xmath21 ned reports an @xmath22sab@xmath23ab type with an outer pseudo - ring and an internal ring . the most recent revaluation by sul06 classifies cig 500 as sbb .",
    "we classify this galaxy as sbb@xmath23 .",
    "the second row in figure 1 shows cig 525 .",
    "the logarithmic image shows a slightly less prominent bulge but a significant bar and moderately opened arms . the @xmath17-band filtered - enhanced image shows more detailed structure along the arms and the inner ring .",
    "the rgb image complements our view emphasizing detailed structure along the arms . while hyperleda ,",
    "ned and sul06 classify this galaxy as sb , we classify cig 525 as sbbc@xmath23 .",
    "the third row of figure 1 shows cig 361 .",
    "the logarithmic image shows a galaxy with a less prominent bulge but with a set of quite opened arms showing significant fragmentation .",
    "the filtered - enhancing image let us suspect about a central barred region and emphasizes the fragmentation along the arms .",
    "the rgb sdss image clearly supports a detailed view of all these features .",
    "while hyperleda and ned classify this galaxy as sb , sul06 classifies cig 361 as sab .",
    "in contrast , and from the observed structure , we classify cig 361 as sabc .",
    "finally the fourth row in figure 1 shows cig 436 .",
    "the bulge appears not so significant and the arms are strongly fragmented / resolved into clumps . an inner ring and a bar region are readily appreciated . while hyperleda classifies this galaxy as sbc , ned , sul06 and we classify cig 436 as sbcd .",
    "a more detailed classification from our images is sbcd(r ) .      for early - type ( e / s0/sa ) candidates , besides a careful inspection to the processed images",
    ", we carried out an evaluation of the geometrical parameters after an isophotal analysis . the ellipticity @xmath1 , position angle @xmath2 , coefficients of the fourier series expansions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the surface brightness radial profile are also presented for each galaxy .",
    "although the absolute value of the @xmath24 parameter depends on the inclination of the galaxy to the line of sight , its sign is useful to detect subtle disky features in the early - type candidates .",
    "the presence of disky isophotes is one criterion for assigning a galaxy to the lenticular class .",
    "however , disks or disky components have also been found among the e class ( e.g. , bender 1988 ; nieto et al .",
    "a galaxy was judged to be e if the @xmath24 parameter showed : 1 ) no significant boxy ( @xmath26 ) or disky ( @xmath27 ) trend in the outer parts , or 2 ) a generally boxy ( @xmath26 ) character in the outer parts and if in addition , the surface brightness profile showed 3 ) the absence of a linear component in the surface brightness profile .",
    "central diskiness is considered not enough for an s0 classification .",
    "additionally we paid attention to changes in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 radial profiles .    for an e type we should not observe a significant change in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while in the case of an s0 , more significant changes in these parameters could be showing evidence of a disks .",
    "the presence of structure in the outer regions of e s like rings / shells and diffuse haloes ( dh ) could mimic an external disk as viewed from the point of view of the geometric profiles .",
    "however , if our additional image processing did not show evidence of definite features , we kept the galaxy type as e. the surface brightness radial profile is also an important tool to discriminate between e / s0 types .",
    "it is known that in the e s the surface brightness profile follows either a de vaucouleurs or a more general srsic law . when the profile presents a significant deflection in the curvature into a linear regime ( not associated to other internal structures like inner disks , rings or bars ) , this could be evidencing the presence of an external disk .",
    "figures 2 and 3 illustrate our imaging procedures for identifying e and s0 galaxies .",
    "each galaxy is identified by its cig number .",
    "figure 2 shows cig 722 as a prototype of an e galaxy .",
    "the upper panels show the @xmath17-band surface brightness , @xmath1 , @xmath2 radial profiles and @xmath3 coefficients of the fourier series expansions of deviations from pure ellipses .",
    "while the surface brightness profile shows no trace of a linear component in the outer regions , the @xmath24 and @xmath25 coefficients of the fourier series expansions do not show any significant tendency towards diskiness or boxiness and at the same time , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 radial profiles show a non - significant trend from the inner to the outer regions .",
    "the lower panels show an rgb color map from the sdss database , a logarithmic - scaled @xmath17-band image and its corresponding filtered - enhanced version . a uniform color along the face of this galaxy is appreciated .",
    "the @xmath17-band filtered - enhanced image shows in addition , some sort of faint external dh s .",
    "we caution the reader about the existence of these dh s in some of our e / s0 candidates and that care must be taken about its interpretation .",
    "similarly as figure 2 , figure 3 shows cig 16 as a prototype of a s0 galaxy .",
    "the surface brightness profile clearly shows an inflection most probably caused by the underlying disk structure ( caution must be paid for the presence of inner rings or bars ) , the @xmath24 and @xmath25 coefficients of the fourier series expansions show the tendency to deviate towards disky shapes but this is more clear at the outskirts . at the same time",
    ", @xmath1 indicates a clear change from the inner to the outer regions reaching a maximum and then a more definite value at the outer disk region while @xmath2 basically indicates the orientation of the semi - major axis .",
    "the lower panels present the rgb color map from the sdss database , the logarithmic - scaled @xmath17-band image , and its filtered - enhanced version .",
    "this time , a faint elongated component along the main @xmath2 of the galaxy can be appreciated in the geometric profiles .",
    "the @xmath17-band filtered - enhanced image let us visualize that disky structure suggested in the geometric profiles .",
    "another relevant goal in our study is to isolate as much as possible subtle differences between lenticular s0 and sa spirals .",
    "the advantages offered by the sdss images allow for a systematic search of fainter features that could point to a more definite morphological classification .",
    "we observed the combined behavior of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 radial profiles as an auxiliary tool to disentangle among s0/sa cases .",
    "significant but not necessarily coupled changes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 radial profiles should be evidencing the presence of additional structure ( in an already identified disk ) in the form of arms , outer rings or envelopes .",
    "if further additional image processing did not show definite evidence of those features , we kept the galaxy type as lenticular . on the contrary , if the evidence about features like faint arms are definite , we classify the galaxy as sa .",
    "figure 4 illustrates cig 393 as a prototype of a very early - type sa galaxy .",
    "while originally suspected as a peculiar s0 candidate from its appearance in both the @xmath17-band and rgb sdss images , the @xmath24 and @xmath25 coefficients of the fourier series expansions suggest the presence of a disk from the inner to the outskirts and at the same time , @xmath1 and @xmath2 show a clear non - coupled change resembling additional structure(s ) , likely a set of smooth wide and tightly - wounded arms .",
    "the color component in the central regions appreciated from the rgb image also suggests the presence of an extra component .",
    "this time the @xmath17-band filtered - enhanced image allows to see that additional component in the form of two inner arms that become wide , smooth but still tight at the outskirts .",
    "the oval shape of the bulge region suggest a bar signature that @xmath1 and @xmath2 marginally detect .",

    "cases like cig 393 clearly illustrates the advantages of the higher resolution and depth of the sdss survey .",
    "physical morphology has appeared as an alternative for classifying galaxies on the basis of measurable structural properties rather than on a visual classification ( see morgan & osterbrock 1969 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; conselice 1997 ; bershady , jangren & conselice 2000 , among others ) . conselice ( 2003 , and more references therein ) has provided a useful framework for classifying galaxies closely tied to underlying physical processes and properties .",
    "conselice ( 2003 ; hereafter c2003 ) argues that the major ongoing and past formation modes of galaxies can be distinguished using three model  independent structural ( photometric ) parameters , which allow for a robust classification system .",
    "these parameters are the concentration of stellar light ( @xmath28 ) , its asymmetric distribution ( @xmath29 ) , and a measure of its clumpiness ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we present our estimate of the @xmath6 parameters in the @xmath19 band and discuss some trends of the @xmath6 parameters at the sdss @xmath7 passbands for the retrieved sample of cig galaxies .",
    "the @xmath6 characterization of this cig galaxies is also helpful as a comparative sample for interpreting similar results of other surveys that sample galaxies in similar ( hernndez  toledo et al . 2007 ; 2008 ) or wide range of environments ( e.g. , c2003 ; hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "2005 ; 2006 ) .",
    "we briefly review each one of the @xmath6 parameters .",
    "_ concentration of light @xmath28.- _ the concentration index @xmath28 is defined as the ratio of the 80% to 20% curve of growth radii ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , within 1.5 times the petrosian inverted radius at r(@xmath33 ) ( @xmath34 ) normalized by a logarithm : @xmath35 ( see for more details c2003 ) .",
    "the concentration is related to the galaxy light ( or stellar mass ) distributions .",
    "_ asymmetry @xmath29.- _ the asymmetry index is the number computed when a galaxy is rotated @xmath36 from its center and then subtracted from its pre - rotated image , and the summation of the intensities of the absolute value residuals of this subtraction are compared with the original galaxy flux ( see for more details c2003 ) .",
    "this parameter is also measured within @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath29 index is sensitive to any feature that produces asymmetric light distributions .",
    "this includes galaxy interactions / mergers , large star - forming regions , and projection effects such as dust lanes ( conselice 1997 ; conselice et al . 2000 ) .    _",
    "clumpiness @xmath30.- _ galaxies undergoing sf are very patchy and contain large amounts of light at high spatial frequency . to quantify this ,",
    "the clumpiness index @xmath30 is defined as the ratio of the amount of light contained in high frequency structures to the total amount of light in the galaxy within @xmath37 ( c2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath30 parameter , because of its morphological nature , is sensitive to dust lanes and inclination ( c2003 ) .",
    "_ measurement of @xmath6 parameters.- _ the measurement of the @xmath6 parameters for the cig galaxies was carried out in several steps : ( i ) close field stars were removed from each image ; ( ii ) sky background was removed from the images ; ( iii ) the center of each galaxy was considered as the barycenter of the light distribution and the starting point for measurements .",
    "the @xmath6 parameters for all the s isolated galaxies were estimated directly , i.e. cig galaxies are not influenced by light contamination from any other galaxy of similar size in the neighborhood ( isolation criteria ) .",
    "galaxies with high inclinations or axis ratios could introduce systematic biased trends in the values of the @xmath6 parameters ( c2003 ) .",
    "cig galaxies whose apparent axial ratios yield `` inclinations '' larger than @xmath38 are represented as open circles on the corresponding plots .    to obtain good @xmath6 estimates ,",
    "the images need to be carefully revised for the possible existence of the following problems ( that should be eliminated as much as possible ) : ( i ) images with poor quality or low s / n ratio ; ( ii ) overlapping bright stars within galaxies ; ( iii ) galaxies placed at the border of the ccd detector ; ( iv ) very bright diffraction spikes from nearby stars crossing a galaxy ; ( v ) galaxies embedded in diffuse light of other sources ; ( vi ) clear cases of merger candidates .    in the present paper , all those factors",
    "have not necessarily been eliminated .",
    "instead a more statistical approach have been assumed by restricting the analysis to more definite ranges of @xmath6 values in each band such that values outside those intervals ( most likely cig galaxies which images suffer from one or more of the above mentioned drawbacks ) were eliminated from the @xmath6 analysis , leaving us with a different final number of galaxies in each band . in the @xmath19 band",

    "2008 only large  scale bars were considered , a condition that we did not impose , and ( 2 ) our bar analysis is based on visual inspections rather than on quantitative measurements ; only a small fraction of spirals ( mainly sa types ) were properly judged for the presence of a bar through a deeper analysis of the isophotal ellipticity and @xmath2 profiles .",
    "thus , it might be that our bar fraction in the @xmath43band is overestimated with respect to barazza et al . on the other hand",
    ", we emphasize that the observed fraction of bars ( and rings ) in the present paper can hardly be a bias of object selection since we simply gathered galaxies according to their availability on the sdss database .    if confirmed our finding of about a 65% fraction of bars in the isolated s galaxies ( @xmath19 band ) , it would imply that interactions and the global effects of the dense environment are not crucial for the formation of bars , if any , the opposite applies , i.e. the bars tend to be thickened or destroyed more efficiently in the higher density media .",
    "the bar thickening or destruction is thought to be at the origin of the boxy / peanut bulges or pseudobulges , and recent simulations in the context of the @xmath11cdm cosmology show the viability of this proposal ( e.g. , avila - reese et al .",
    "2005 ; athanassoula 2005 ; bornaud , combes & semelin 2005 ; martinez - valpuesta , shlosman & heller 2006 )",
    ". it could be that in the bar phenomenon dominate the internal disk galaxy processes rather than the environmental influence ( see for a related discussion hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2007 ) .    as in previous works",
    ", we also found here that the bar occurrence is similar in early and late  type spirals ( c.f .",
    "eskridge et al . 2000 ; hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2007 but see barazza et al . 2008 ) .",
    "what the latter authors report actually is a clear tendency to increase the bar fraction as the @xmath90 ratio increases ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the effective and optical radius , respectively , and their ratio can be interpreted as a measure of the light concentration , and therefore of the bulge  to  disk ratio ) . for our sample , we have measured the @xmath93 concentration , and we confirm that indeed the fraction of barred galaxies significantly depends on it : for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 the fraction of barred galaxies increases from @xmath97 to @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that while the fraction of barred galaxies does not depend on the morphological type , it does as a function of the light concentration parameter .",

( 2007 ) show a slight shift of the early - type sequence toward blue color when the local density changes by about an order of magnitude , consistent with the above statements .",

    "we were able to carry out a detailed morphological study of the isolated cig@xmath9sdss sample .",
    "most of e galaxies in this sample show actually fine structures ( e.g. , shells , rings , ripples ) , dust lanes , `` diffuse haloes '' , and inner disks , as well as disky or boxy isophotes .",
    "the finding of these morphological distortions is based on the judgment of the images after different kernel sizes were used in the filtering process of e / s0 galaxies as explained in  3.1 notice that we did not applied a quantitative procedure for determining distortions with respect to a model light distribution ( e.g. , colbert et al . 2001 ; van dokkum 2005 ) .",
    "the distortions that we call `` diffuse haloes '' ( dh ) consist of faint diffuse envelopes that appear symmetric in shape .",
    "it is not clear at this moment what is the nature of this component .",
    "cig 533 is an e galaxy showing such a diffuse component .",
    "interestingly cig 533 is the most luminous galaxy ( @xmath104 ) in our list .",
    "notice however that the presence of a nearby ( projected on the sky ) dwarf galaxy , makes cig 533 to appear in the list of possible interacting galaxies by sul06 .",
    "it should be mentioned that extended luminous halos were found in numerical simulations of galaxy formation in the cosmological context ; these faint structures consist of stars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events that characterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies ( abadi , navarro & steinmetz 2006 ) .",
    "an e galaxy was considered to be boxy or disky if the @xmath24 parameter amplitude reached at least a @xmath66 2.5% level within the observed radius .",
    "this is a first order estimate and it should be noticed that no normalization to a characteristic radius ( e.g. , the effective radius , @xmath105 ) is reported .",
    "examples of boxy and disky isophotes can be seen in cig 264 and cig 768 , respectively . in cig 245",
    "a shell can be appreciated and in cig 582 , dust lanes . in this last case",
    "the dust lane appears to affect the fourth  order cosine profile .",
    "a localized knot near the central region can also be appreciated .",
    "these features together suggest evidence in favor of a merger event .    according to our morphological revaluation , in the cig@xmath9sdss sample only 3.5% of the galaxies",
    "are of e type , showing that the formation of e galaxies in low ",
    "density environments is a rare process .",
    "the average @xmath19-band luminosity of the e galaxies @xmath106 confirm the scarcity of luminous e galaxies in isolated environments ( e.g. , park et al .",
    "table 6 lists the e galaxies in this work and their distorted morphology properties .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the cig number , column ( 2 ) indicates the boxy / disky nature , column ( 3 ) indicates the presence of fine structure in the form shells / ripples or rings , column ( 4 ) indicates the presence of dust lanes , column ( 5 ) the presence of inner disks , column ( 6 ) the presence blue / red knots , column ( 7 ) the presence of a diffuse halo @xmath100 , column ( 8) gives the ( @xmath5 ) color and column ( 9 ) give the @xmath19-band absolute magnitude ( @xmath107 ) . out of the 18 e cig@xmath9sdss galaxies , at least 15 ( 83% ) are characterized by some kind of morphological distortion : 50% show fine stuctures , 17% present dust lane structures , 39% show a kind of diffuse halo , and 39% present evidence of an inner disk ; in most of the cases a given galaxy presents combinations of several of these distortions . on the other hand , we do not find for most of these e galaxies evidence of blue clumpy tidal tails , which are typical in s ",
    "s interactions , as well as of other kind of `` smooth '' faint tidal features .",
    "it is possible that in deeper images , the latter features could appear ( see van dokkum 2005 ) , so that the 83% of e galaxias with morphological distortions found here is actually a lower limit .",
    "notice in table 6 the incidence of diffuse haloes ( @xmath100 ) in some of the e galaxies .",
    "we are not clear at this moment about the nature of this component or about it relationship to a merger event .",
    "on the other hand , we have found that among the 18 e galaxies , 8 are boxy and 7 disky .",
    "interesting enough , among the 4 galaxies with blue colors ( tentatively @xmath108 , see fig .",
    "7 ) , 3 are disky , and the other one is boxy , but it shows evidence of an inner disk .    according to simulation results , e  e ( dry ) mergers do not develop prominent clumpy tidal tails and instead are characterized by off  center outer envelopes and the ejections of stars ( e.g. , combes et al . 1995 ) , which can be seen as fans , shells , rings , envelopes , and tidal features .",
    "this and other works suggest that the perturbation features in the e ",
    "e mergers are of short duration ( less than 0.5 gyr ) , so that their detection implies that the merger happened relatively recently .",
    "we look for the presence of @xmath109 asymmetries from a fourier analysis and found no significant amplitudes for the 18 e galaxies in this study .",
    "the numerical simulations also show that the outcome of merging early  type galaxies is an anisotropic , slowly rotating , boxy spheroid ( naab et al . 2006 ) , while low - mass , highly rotating , disky spheroids are produced typically in unequal  mass spiral mergers ( naab et al . 1999 ; naab & burkert 2003 ) . in general , in order that an e system forms from s",
    " s mergers , the merger should be major ( approximate mass ratios in the range 1:13:1 ; e.g. , bournaud , jog & combes 2005 , and more references therein ) .",
    "the latter authors have found that in the case of intermediate mergers , with mass ratios in the range 4:110:1 , hybrid systems that could be considered as candidates for s0 galaxies form . in the case of minor mergers ,",
    "the simulations show that the disturbed disks survive ( e.g. , velazquez & white 1999 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we can speculate that most of the isolated e galaxies analyzed here suffered recent major mergers , mostly dry .",
    "however , for a few galaxies we find also pieces of evidence of intense knots , central blue colors , in which case a major merger could be expected to have involved at least one disk galaxy",
    ". findings of late sf in isolated e galaxies were also reported by other authors ( treu et al .",
    "2005 ; reda et al . 2007 ) .",
    "for example , reda et al .",
    "( 2007 ) estimated the age of the stellar populations of a sample of local isolated e s revealing that several galaxies have central young stars , which also require a recent gaseous accretion or merger .",
    "they conclude that a formation scenario of a single dissipative collapse can not explain the spatial distribution of the stellar population and kinematic properties of their studied e isolated galaxies .",
    "the main question is now in the statistics : what fraction of isolated e s show evidence of recent `` dynamical '' evolution by dry major mergers and what fraction corresponds to e s with recent sf , product of mergers of galaxies with gas and/or late gas accretion .",
    "for the small sample studied here , the former seems to be the case .",
    "the above question is relevant for the models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "studies with larger samples are needed .    while there is significant evidence that e galaxies could be formed by merging scenarios , the origins of s0 galaxies are more obscure .",
    "since most s0 studies have concentrated on cluster s0 galaxies , the proposed origins of these systems mostly involve processes that remove gas from disk galaxies and thus truncate sf ( mihos et al .",
    "1995 ; quilis et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , some of these processes may not be relevant to the histories of very isolated s0 galaxies",
    ". the relative numbers of e and s0 galaxies in the cfa survey is 1:4 in favor of s0 galaxies ( marzke et al .",
    "this is in contrast to their relative abundance in the cig catalog , 1:1.15 ( sul06 ) and 1:1.85 ( this work ) , suggesting this the importance of the environment on the formation of s0 galaxies .",
    "a possible way to form s0 s in an isolated environment has been mentioned already above : galaxy mergers of intermediate mass ratios , 4:110:1 ( bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we start by exploring how the @xmath6 parameters for cig galaxies do change with wavelength .",
    "figure 10 shows the cumulative distribution function of the @xmath6 parameters at @xmath110 , @xmath19 and @xmath14 bands .",
    "significant changes in the @xmath6 parameters with wavelength are appreciated .",
    "the concentration @xmath28 becomes higher from bluer to redder bands while in the case of both the asymmetry @xmath29 and clumpiness @xmath30 parameters , their values strongly decrease from bluer to redder bands .",
    "in figure 11 we plot the average and standard deviation values of the @xmath6 parameters vs wavelength ( color band ) for the cig galaxies sorted into e / s0 , early and late  type spirals ( e / s0 left panel sasb middle panel and sbcsm right panel , respectively ) . the @xmath6 parameters of later types show on average more dependence with wavelength than the early types , as well as more scatter at a given band . among the @xmath6 parameters ,",
    "the clumpiness is the most sensitive to wavelength , although the corresponding error bars indicate a significant dispersion in this parameter .",
    "figure 12 shows the loci of the cig@xmath9sdss galaxies sorted into e / s0 , sasb and sbcsm galaxies in the projected planes of the @xmath43band @xmath6 space . for comparison , the averages and standard deviations of sasb and sbcsm subsamples of cig galaxies in the johnson - cousins @xmath49-band system ( hernndez - toledo et al . 2007 ; 2008 ) and of e / s0 isolated galaxies from the hyperleda database ( hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2006 ) are shown ( crosses and continuous error bars ) .",
    "also the @xmath111band averages and standard deviations of galaxies in interacting s+s pairs ( hernndez  toledo et al . 2005 ) , and starburst and ultra luminous infrared ( ulir ) galaxies ( c2003 ) are also plotted .",
    "the question of whether the disk of a galaxy is intrinsically asymmetric or not is of great interest .",
    "some studies have shown that important deviations from axisymmetry exist in the optical and other wavelengths ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ; richter & sancisi 1994 ; c2003 ) . however , systematic attempts to quantify asymmetry and other measures like the @xmath6 parameters in several wavelengths for well  selected local samples of isolated galaxies are rare and missing in the literature .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath29 has been shown to be sensitive mainly to galaxy interactions / mergers , but also is influenced by sf clumps , dust lanes , and projection effects .",
    "the quantitative measure of @xmath29 in the present sample of cig@xmath9sdss galaxies spans roughly the range @xmath112 , the average and standard deviation being @xmath113 .",
    "the later types are slightly more asymmetric on average than the earlier ones .",
    "the mean asymmetries reported here are definitively lower than the typical ones of interacting disk galaxies ( hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "next , we illustrate how the @xmath6 parameters of the cig galaxies correlate with other properties and whether these correlations are sensitive to the passband or not .",
    "figure 13 shows the @xmath114 band @xmath6 parameters vs morphological type @xmath115 .",
    "code numbers for each morphological type are now associated according to the hyperleda convention .",
    "the trend seen of the @xmath6 parameters is a consequence of the natural flocculency and sf in galaxies as they get later in type .",
    "sf is more active for later types ( as is evidenced also by the trend of higher @xmath29 and @xmath30 values as the types are later and the color bluer ) .",
    "the correlations of the @xmath6 parameters with @xmath115 are very scattered , the tightest being with the concentration parameter @xmath28 in the sense of smaller values of @xmath28 as the type is later . for the @xmath29 parameter",
    ", one sees only a weak trend of @xmath29 on average being higher as the type is latter , and for the @xmath30 parameter , it is not possible to define even a trend .",
    "the trends of @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath115 are more robust in the @xmath19 and @xmath52 bands , suggesting this that the basic structure of galaxies is better revealed in the infrared bands .    figures 14 and 15 show the @xmath6 parameters vs the total @xmath116 color for the cig sample sorted into e / so and sa - sm types , respectively",
    ". corrected colors are presented for sa - sm types .",
    "nearly edge  on galaxies ( inclination @xmath117 ) are plotted with crosses .",
    "given that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are particularly sensitive to projection effects , it is important to visualize these galaxies since they may be masking any trend .",
    "figure 14 shows the natural scatter in the @xmath6 parameters and a segregation in blue and red colors for the isolated e / s0 galaxies ( hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "figure 15 shows the higher sensitivity of the @xmath6 parameters to intrinsic color variations in isolated spiral galaxies ( hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "although it is expected that the color trends are more robust towards the redder bands which are less contaminated from ( transient ) sf effects thus better representing the basic structure of galaxies , we find a large scatter in the @xmath14 band .",
    "this is indicating the intrinsically noisier nature of this band .",
    "the building up of a well  defined sample of local isolated galaxies with uniformly  derived and detailed morphological information is of great relevance because it provides a fair database for comparison with model predictions as well as with observed samples of galaxies in other environments and at higher redshifts . in this paper we reported ( i ) a detailed morphological revaluation of a sample of 549 cig galaxies that were available in the sdss(dr6 )",
    "database , ( ii ) looked for morphological distortions in the analyzed isolated galaxies , ( iii ) calculated corrected magnitudes and colors , as well as the structural @xmath6 parameters for all the galaxies , and ( iv ) discussed some preliminary conclusions based on the obtained results .",
    "we have taken advantage of the improved scale and dynamic range of the sdss database and proposed an image processing scheme that enhances the detection of low / high surface brightness morphological and structural components in these cig galaxies .",
    "we have used logarithmic scaled images to look for internal / external details ; @xmath17 band filtered  enhanced images to look for internal structure in the form of star forming regions , bars , rings and/or structure embedded into dusty regions ; and used complementary rgb color images from the sdss database to visualize the spatial distribution of the sf and other components like dust ( blue colors for recent sf and red colors for older populations / dusty components ) .    in the case of e / s0/sa galaxy candidates ,",
    "we have estimated and used additional information in the form of a surface brightness profile and the corresponding geometric profiles ( ellipticity @xmath1 , position angle @xmath2 and @xmath3 coefficients of the fourier series expansions of deviations of a pure ellipse ) from the @xmath19 band images in order to provide evidence of boxiness / diskiness and other structural details that help to discriminate morphology in these galaxies .",
    "the median morphological type in the present cig@xmath9sdss sample is sbc ( @xmath118 ) ; 35% of the galaxies are earlier than sbc , and 65% are sbc or later .",
    "this new revaluation gives somewhat different morphological fractions with respect to previous reports , mainly in the e , s0 , sa and sab types . while sul06 found 5.7% of e types , 6.6% of s0 types and 1.4% of transition e / s0 types , amounting to 13.7% of e / s0 galaxies , our results indicate 3.5% of e types and 5% of s0 types , amounting to a fraction of only 8.5% of e / s0 galaxies .",
    "this emphasizes the difficulty of finding e / s0 galaxies in environments typical to the isolated galaxies . for early ",
    "type s galaxies , while sul06 found 1.3% of sa types and 5.1% of sab types , we accounted for 6.5% of sa types and 7.8% of sab types . in general",
    ", for 74% of the galaxies in common with sul06 both classifications have a difference @xmath81 .    for the 539 cig@xmath9sdss galaxies we have calculated the absolute magnitudes in the bands @xmath4 and corrected by both the galaxy and internal extinction .",
    "the average and 1@xmath67 dispersions of the @xmath5 color for the e / s0 , sa  sb , and sbc ",
    "sm / irr morphology ranges are @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "the color  magnitude diagram for the e / s0 s is quite flat and narrow , while for the disk galaxies , a trend of redder galaxies as they get brighter , but with a large scatter is appreciated .",
    "we reported a tentative @xmath43band fraction of bars in disk galaxies of 65.8% ( defined only by an eye inspection and excluding objects with @xmath122 ) ; @xmath123 are clearly barred ( sb ) , and @xmath124 show evidence of a weak bar ( sab ) .",
    "the reported fraction of bars in the present cig isolated disk galaxies is larger than others reported in the literature for samples related to field and cluster / group environments .",
    "the fraction of barred galaxies does not change with the morphological type , but it correlates significantly with the light concentration parameter @xmath93 .",
    "we have also found 33.3% of the disk galaxies showing ring structures .",
    "our image processing scheme of the sdss data allowed us to find a richness of distinct substructure in the isophotal shapes of the e galaxies as well as a series of morphological distortions .",
    "out of the 18 e galaxies in the sample , 8 ( 44% ) show boxy isophotes and 7 ( 38% ) show disky isophotes . among the 4 blue e s ( @xmath125 ) ,",
    "3 are disky and 1 boxy , but the latter shows evidence of an inner disk .",
    "the fraction of e s with one or more kinds of morphological distortion amounts to 78% : fine stuctures ( 50% ) , dust lane structures ( 17% ) , diffuse halo ( 39% ) , and inner disk ( 39% ) .",
    "our results suggest that most of the isolated e s suffered recent dry major mergers ( e  e ) .",
    "only a few of them show pieces of evidence of mergers of galaxies with gas , and/or of late gas accretion and intense sf .",
    "in order to complement our morphological study , we have estimated the @xmath7 band @xmath6 parameters of the 549 cig@xmath9sdss galaxies as part of a model  independent morphological system . the @xmath6 averages and standard deviations in the @xmath43band for the e / s0 galaxies are @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , for the sasb galaxies are @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and for the sbcsm galaxies are @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",

    "the mean asymmetries reported here are definitively lower than the typical ones for interacting disk galaxies ( hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "while the @xmath28 parameter systematically increases from bluer to redder bands , both @xmath29 and @xmath30 significantly decrease .",
    "the @xmath6 parameters present more robust trends with the morphological type @xmath115 and the total @xmath135 color in the redder bands , suggesting that the basic structure of galaxies is revealed better in the redder bands . in any case ,",
