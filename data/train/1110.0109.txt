    "the connection between einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , the dynamical theory of space - time , and quantum mechanics ( qm ) has a long history in physics and more than ever is nowadays a subject of intense research , both from theoretical and experimental perspectives , mainly in connection with possible deviations from gr and/or qm . until now , experiments have already confirmed that inertia and newtonian gravity affect quantum particles , mainly electrons and neutrons , in ways that are fully consistent with gr down to distances of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "gravitational - inertial fields leave their mark on particle wave functions in a variety of ways ; particularly , they induce quantum phases that have been measured in some of the most renowned experiments on this topic @xcite . recently",
    ", the purpose of tests of gravity has been mainly focused in determining the validity of the equivalence principle at the level of atoms , molecules , quasi - particles and antimatter .",
    "this translates into a need for higher precision tests of gr , and atomic physics together with quantum optics offer some of the most accurate results and promising scenarios .",
    "most of the experimental tests of gr within the quantum realm arise from predictions on fully covariant wave equations where inertia and gravity appear as external classical fields , providing very valuable information on how einstein s views carry through into the quantum world .",
    "however , many of the initially proposed and tested effects considered mainly one - particle systems .",
    "this approach leaves aside the possibility of using the internal quantum structure of atoms or molecules as additional parameters .",
    "nevertheless , this situation is drastically changing recently due to the fast development of matter wave interferometry @xcite .",
    "broadly speaking , previous work related to the description of atoms in a background gravitational field can be divided in three main branches , though with much interrelation among them : ( i ) the study of gravitational modifications to atomic spectra of mainly hydrogen - like atoms , which were considered as a quantum reduced mass revolving around some force center @xcite .",
    "a two - body description of the atom can be found in refs .",
    "( ii ) restricted proofs of the equivalence principle for test bodies made of classical electromagnetically interacting particles , within the ppn framework or within the @xmath2 formalism for static spherically symmetric spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the formulation of a quantum equivalence principle has been studied in refs .",
    "( iii ) tests and studies of the gravitational red shift , where atomic clocks were described as quantum mechanical systems within the @xmath2 or ppn formalisms @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we consider the effect of a classical background gravitational field , described by gr , upon matter at the atomic level , where the use of qm becomes mandatory .",
    "we extend previous work in the following aspects : ( i ) we will consider the case of hydrogen - like atoms described as two - body systems in the way first discussed in ref .",
    "the inclusion of the position of the atom as a new degree of freedom may provide additional couplings to probe the effects of gravity upon quantum objects in the region where tidal forces become important .",
    "( ii ) the background gravitational field has no particular spatial symmetry .",
    "( iii ) following the steps of ref .",
    "@xcite , a quantum mechanical relativistic two - body effective potential in the background gravitational field is produced , which takes into account retardation effects arising from the one - photon exchange between the currents .",
    "this constitutes the gravitational generalization of the relativistic coulomb - breit potential @xcite .",
    "most of the general assumptions underlying this work are similar to those of refs.@xcite : ( i ) the external gravitational field is well described by gr , so that it satisfies einstein s field equations .",
    "additionally , we ignore back - reaction effects .",
    "( ii ) all the interacting particles are influenced by the background gravitational field at the quantum level .",
    "( iii ) there exists an ideal freely falling observer in a region outside the sources of the background gravitational field .",
    "this observer determines that , in his coordinate patch , the metric of the spacetime has the form , @xmath3 is the tetrad such that @xmath4 , @xmath5 are tetrad indices , while @xmath6 are coordinate indices .",

    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 here @xmath11 are three spatial coordinates , @xmath12 is the proper time of the observer and @xmath13 is the projection of the background riemann tensor on the orthonormal tetrad carried by him , which in general depends on the proper time due to the motion of the observer .",
    "the weakness of the gravitational interaction induces very small corrections upon the observables , so that in our final results we preserve only quantities up to first order in @xmath13 .",
    "the metric ( [ fermetr ] ) is that of a freely falling observer using fermi normal coordinates , which are appropriate to describe local experiments performed by inertial observers @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the spatial extension and the time duration of events related to observations in the quantum system are very small compared with the characteristic lengths and times of appreciable changes in the observer s riemann tensor @xcite .",
    "this allows well defined energy levels and the use of time - independent perturbation theory . within this adiabatic approximation",
    "it is possible to ignore the @xmath12 dependence of the metric and of all the objects constructed from it : the time coordinate becomes just a fixed but arbitrary parameter @xcite .",
    "( v ) conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) imply that the observer determines that his ricci tensor @xmath14 is equal to zero .",
    "we also assume that during the measurements performed by the observer there are no particle creation effects due to the gravitational field .",
