    "the agreement between the ismf direction of the filament polarizations and the velocity vector of interstellar material flowing through the heliosphere , the perpendicularity between the * bv *  plane and the filament axis , and the low level of magnetic turbulence in the filament , suggest that the filament polarizations may be associated with the deflection of charged grains , the ismf , and interstellar plasma around the heliosphere in the outer heliosheath regions .",

    "the deficit of small grains is attributed partly to the `` filtration '' of grains with large values of @xmath33  that couple to the interstellar plasma and magnetic field that is swept around the heliopause @xcite .    the perpendicular relation between the filament axis and the * bv *  plane would be an outcome of the lorentz force on the grains .",
    "nanograins experience additional charging in the outer heliosheath due to collisions with the heated compressed interstellar plasma and enhanced radiation field , with the maximum differential increase in the surface potential of the grains occurring for the smallest grains ( fig . 2 of s12 ) .",
    "s12 showed that the surface potentials of compact interstellar silicate grains in heliosheath regions are enhanced by an order of magnitude compared to values in the surrounding ism .",
    "as the dust grains approach the heliosphere from the distant ism , lorentz forces act to displace grains into directions that are perpendicular to the * bv *  plane .",

    "since all of the smallest grains are deflected , the filament width must depend on the detailed configuration of the heliopause , the grain charging that occurs in the outer heliosheath , and the strength of the lorentz force .",

    "if the filament has a heliospheric origin , then the second characteristic of the filament , that the ismf is directed toward the inflow vector of interstellar neutrals , implies that the filament forms where the interstellar ion and dust streamlines are parallel to each other and to the localized ismf direction .",

    "an important requirement is that the dust grains remain aligned with respect to the ismf direction during the deflection of the dust flow at the heliopause .",
    "the organized set of filament polarizations must be tracing an organized magnetic field that has a minimal turbulence .",

    "in contrast , in the inner heliosheath the maximum standard deviation of the compressive turbulence ( corresponding to variations in magnetic field strength ) was 36% of the total field strength suggesting that the inner heliosheath is unlikely to be the origin of the polarizations .    the low level of interstellar field turbulence in the outer heliosheath found by _ voyager",

    "if an outer heliosheath origin for the filament polarizations is confirmed by theoretical modeling , a new diagnostic of the outer heliosheath will become available .",
    "this diagnostic would have the unique property of allowing the outer heliosheath to be monitored using ground - based observations .",
    "this convergence between interstellar dust data and heliosheath science would be useful for understanding the interactions between astrospheres around external stars and the ism , heliosphere - related foregrounds to the cosmic microwave background , and the time - variable flux of interstellar grains into the inner heliosphere and terrestrial atmosphere .",

    "<S> a recently discovered filament of polarized starlight that traces a coherent magnetic field is shown to have several properties that are consistent with an origin in the outer heliosheath of the heliosphere : ( 1 ) the magnetic field that provides the best fit to the polarization position angles is directed toward @xmath0=357.3@xmath1 , @xmath2@xmath3 ; this direction is within @xmath4 of the observed upwind direction of the flow of interstellar neutral helium gas through the heliosphere . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the magnetic field is ordered ; the component of the variation of the polarization position angles that can be attributed to magnetic turbulence is @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the axis of the elongated filament can be approximated by a line that defines an angle of @xmath6 with the plane that is formed by the interstellar magnetic field vector and the vector of the inflowing neutral gas ( the * bv *  plane ) . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this polarization feature arises from aligned interstellar dust grains in the outer heliosheath where the interstellar plasma and magnetic field are deflected around the heliosphere . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation suggests that the polarization is seen where stream lines of the flow and the draped interstellar magnetic field lines are approximately parallel to each other and perpendicular to the sightline . an ordered magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> is required so that grain alignment is not disrupted during the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the filament location is consistent with dust plumes previously predicted to form around the heliosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed outer heliosheath location of the polarizing grains can be tested with three - dimensional models that track torques on asymmetric dust grains as they propagate through the heliosheath plasma , and using these models to evaluate grain alignment and the asymmetric extinction of the grains .    _ </S>",
