    "now we should note that , the non - linear gravitational physics of structure formation changes the arena and the questions .",

    "these statistics are linked to the mass ( luminosity ) profile of galaxies .",

    "a long path is passed .",
    "spherical collapse @xcite and press - schechter ( ps ) formalism @xcite start the venue , where later this approach is developed in a stochastic framework know as excursion set theory ( est ) ( or extended ps formalism ) @xcite .",
    "the est is based on a probabilistic approach to the structure formation .",
    "the evolution of density contrast with respect to the density contrast variance in different smoothing regions is studied . in this context , the trajectory of density contrast versus variance for different points of the universe is obtained .",
    "the trajectories that pass a specified critical density contrast become qualified to be non - linear structures ( halos of dm ) which must become the host of baryonic matter . in the other word , dm",

    "there is an idea of re - formulating the est with path integral approach by @xcite which helps to investigate the extensions of the theory @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose a new framework to study the est approach of structure formation know as matrix formalism of est .",
    "the idea that we develop in this work become from discretization of the trajectories , where we will be capable of defining probability kets and transition matrix for any desired trajectory .",
    "we obtained all the plausible results of standard est for markov processes .",

    "this formalism is suitable for data analysis studies , which tends to study the n - body simulations .",
    "the finite number of probability states in matrix formalism est is an advantage for this type of studies .",
    "the structure of the work is : in sec.([sec : overview ] ) we review the non - linear structure formation in the context of ps formalism and the standard excursion set theory as the extension of ps . in sec.([sec : matrix ] ) , we introduce the matrix formalism of excursion set theory and its theoretical basis . in sec.([sec : number ] ) , we will discuss the first up - crossing concept and we find the number density of structures in this framework . in this section",
    "we also compare the results with numerical analysis , and dark matter simulations . in sec .",
    "( [ sec : cont ] ) we discuss the continuous limit of matrix formalism and we will discuss the probability transition rate matrix and the derivation of fokker - planck equation . in sec.([sec :",
    "mmp ] ) we express the physics of main progenitors in halo merger history in matrix formalism and finally in sec.([sec : conclusion ] ) we conclude and indicate the future prospects of this work .",
    "in addition , appendix a of this paper shows the statistics in matrix formalism of est and the capability of this formalism in calculating the statistical quantities .",
    "one of the main topics of interest in non - linear structure formation is the study of the number density of structures in the universe . in linear regime",
    "we have the density contrast field as @xmath1 defined for each point in the universe . in this regime",
    "the density of structures grows linearly with growth function as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the linearly extrapolated present time density contrast and @xmath4 is the linear growth function normalized to unity in present time @xcite .",
    "now the idea is that by using the spherical collapse @xcite which introduces a critical density @xmath5 , is the extrapolation of the density contrast of a collapsed structure in liner regime ] the regions with @xmath6 collapsed at time @xmath7 and after virialization they become a dark matter halo which will be capable to host a baryonic structure @xcite .",
    "note that the barrier crossing condition can be re - expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , which means the density contrast is extrapolated to the present time and the barrier is moved corresponding to the time that we are interested in studying the non - linear structure . in this context in order to think about the collapsed regions press and schechter @xcite considered a smoothed field as below @xmath10 where sub - indices refer to smoothed density function , @xmath11 is the window function with a specific radius of smoothing @xmath12 .",
    "the shape of window function is arbitrary , we can use the top - hat filter in real space for example as it is introduced in ps formalism . for each collapsed region , we can assign a mass @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the background density and @xmath15 is the volume coefficient which depends on the choice of the window function ( i.e. @xmath16 for top - hat window function ) .",
    "the important ansatz of the ps formalism is that the probability of the regions which satisfy the condition of @xmath17 is the same as the fraction of the volume at time @xmath7 , contain halos with mass greater than @xmath18 .",
    "we should note that this specific mass is related to the smoothing scale @xmath12 due to choice of the window function .",
    "+ one important point to indicate is that we can assume ( eligibly ) , @xmath3 is a gaussian function , accordingly @xmath19 is gaussian as well . in this case",
    "the probability of finding regions with mass larger than @xmath18 will be : @xmath20 the distribution of density contrast in equation above is related to cosmological linear theory by the variance of fluctuations defined as below : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the fourier transform of the window function and @xmath23 is the power spectrum of matter perturbations in linear regime , in which the physics of dark matter and dark energy plays essential role in its construction . a very important point to indicate",
    "is that if we use the matter power spectrum of cdm we find that the variance is a monotonic decreasing function of mass @xmath18 ( or equivalently the radius @xmath12 ) .",
    "the ps formalism has its own shortcomings and limitations .",
    "the important one is the cloud in cloud problem .",
    "the miscounting of the structures in ps formalism results in a miscalculated factor two .",
    "an alternative approach to the clustering of density contrast is the excursion set theory defined by bond et al .",
    "this theory with a reasonable way solves the cloud - in - cloud problem . in this picture for each point of the universe @xmath24 , there is a function of smoothed density contrast in terms of variance @xmath25 @xcite . as we mentioned the monotonic behavior of @xmath26 let us to set the @xmath27 equivalent to the smoothing radius @xmath12 and the mass enclosed in it .",
    "note that in the limit of @xmath28 which is equal to @xmath29 the smoothing box is equal to the whole universe and the density contrast is equal to zero .",
    "increasing @xmath27 corresponds to decreasing the weighting radius ( or mass ) , in this case we anticipate that the @xmath30 deviates from zero .",
    "one crucial point to add to this picture is usage of the sharp k - space filter defined as below : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the size of top - hat filter in k - space and @xmath33 is the fourier modes of density contrast .",
    "the advantage of this specific filter is that the @xmath34 which is the change in the density contrast when we move from @xmath35 to @xmath36 is a gaussian random field .",
    "in addition this process become a markov process .",
    "it means that this processes have a memory of only its previous step @xcite .",
    "the variance of gaussian random variable is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is defined as ^2(k_c)=_k < k_cp(k)k^2 . accordingly",
    "the value of @xmath19 at a given position in universe is performing a markovian random walk .",
    "we should note that , if we change the filter function the process will not be a markovian .",
    "the markovian behavior of trajectories with the sharp k - space filter in est plane , let us to calculate the number density of the structures by solving the cloud - in - cloud problem . we should note that , the sharp - k space filter is not a realistic window function for mass estimation in simulations and observations , as a consequence , using more realistic window functions such as real space top - hat force est process to deviate from markovianity . to address this problem ,",
    "some extensions of est such as correlated steps walks are proposed .",
    "however in this work , we developed the new formalism in the context of the markovianity . in the est",
    "we find the first up - crossing ( fu ) using the idea of mirroring trajectories as : [ eq : upcross ] f_fu(>s _ * ) = _ -^_cd_s , where @xmath39 shows the probability of the trajectories which will have their first up - crossing in larger variance than the specific @xmath40 .",
    "the second term in eq.([eq : upcross ] ) comes from the mirroring trajectories . for every trajectory that passes the barrier in smaller variances ( @xmath41 ) but in @xmath40 are below the barrier in point @xmath42",
    "there is a mirroring trajectory that at the specific point it has the value of @xmath43 .",

    "-^_c(s_*,_s)d_s - _ _ c^ ( s_*,_s)d_s . there is a notation that is used to show the first up - crossing probability in variance interval of @xmath44 which is defined as @xmath45 .",
    "the idea discussed above will be used in the next sections for the matrix formalism of est .",
    "the number density of structures in mass range of @xmath18 and @xmath46 can be obtained from the first up - crossing distribution as [ nfu ] n(m ,",
    "t)dm = dm= ||dm , where @xmath14 is the background matter density , and @xmath47 is the number density of the structures in mass range of @xmath18 and @xmath46 . in the case if we use the gaussian probability function the number density becomes @xmath48 the main advantage of using the est formalism is its ability to construct the merger history of the dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "for this task , the essential quantity to calculate is the main progenitors of dark matter halos , which can be obtained via conditional probability in est .",
    "assume that we have a halo of mass @xmath49 at time @xmath50 , the probability that this halo s main progenitor has a mass @xmath51 and it is merged in time @xmath52 can be calculated with conditional first up - crossing probability as : @xmath53 ds_1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are variances related to mass @xmath51 and @xmath49 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "a final piece to add to this theoretical overview section is the introduction of the diffusion - type equation .",
    "the probability @xmath58 of a trajectory in a specific variance , to be in @xmath19 and @xmath59 is obtained from equation below@xcite = - + , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for sharp k - space filter",
    "we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly the diffusion - type equation reduces to fokker - planck equation @xcite = .",
    "a very important point , worth to state it again is that in the case of markovianity ( sharp k - space filter ) , when @xmath64 , the variance of changes in density contrast become equal to steps in variance axis @xmath65 . in the next section we will introduce our new framework of excursion set theory .",
    "in this section we first present the matrix formulation of excursion set theory . in the first subsection",
    "we come up with the representation of formalism . in the second subsection",
    "we discuss the processes of construction of the transition matrix for a random walk with equal probability and we wrap up this section with the third subsection by discussing the construction of transition matrix with a gaussian distribution .      as we discussed in the first section , the excursion set theory in its essence has a stochastic point of view to theory of structure formation . for each point of the universe we can compute the density contrast in a box of size @xmath12 .",

    "the physical quantities of our interest are the probabilities .",
    "this means that , we are interested to know : what portion of the trajectories in a specific time - slice ( redshift ) passes from a specific @xmath69 in _ 2d - plane of est_. with this idea in mind , in order to present the matrix formalism , we assume that the density contrast can be discretized by large finite number of probability states for each @xmath27 . now it make sense to define the probability of each density contrast in terms of a vector in any desired variance as below @xmath70 where subscript @xmath71 in the _ probability ket _",

    "we have @xmath82 following the spirit of the est , now we want to study the physics of the trajectories .",
    "accordingly the next step will be the implementation of markovianity as a first simplified assumption in matrix formalism of excursion set theory .",

    "this can be formalized through the @xmath84 coefficients as below @xmath85 + where the sum is considered to be applied over all possible transitions from step @xmath86 to @xmath27 , where @xmath87 is the step in s - axis , which after this we can set it to unity for convenience in notation .",
    "we should keep in mind that @xmath87 , in this formalism is strictly related to the resolution of the size of the window function , which we can apply in n - body simulations or in lss surveys .",

    "this appendix describes some of the properties of est in matrix formalism and we want to show the capability of this formalism in calculating the statistical quantities . in this arena",
    ", we study the concept of the expectation value and cross correlation of observables .",
    "first of all in order to find the expectation value of any desired quantity as a function of the density contrast we use the adder delta @xmath242 as a useful tool for our calculations , keeping in mind the relation introduced in eq.([eq : delta ] ) and the theorems we showed in previous section , we have @xmath243 .",
    "this relations will help us to find the expectation value of @xmath244 as a function of @xmath66 as below @xmath245 it is obvious that we can write @xmath246 in terms of the matrix components defined above .",
    "@xmath247 by knowing @xmath248 and @xmath249 we can write down the expectation value as @xmath250 the first line of eq.([eq : exp1 ] ) is by definition of the probability ket .",
    "the second equality come up from the definition of the expectation value of @xmath251 .",
    "then we used the definition of the adder delta and by the assumption of the markovianity , we write the probability in the specific step @xmath27 in terms of transition matrix applied to probability ket . finally , now we can define @xmath252 as below to write the expectation value in a sophisticated way .",
    "this is possible because of the relation between the transition matrix and the adder delta @xmath118 @xmath253 where @xmath254 .",
    "this is , schematically , very similar to the case of heisenberg picture of operators in quantum mechanics . now that we find a general expression for the expectation value ,",
    "the next important step in statistics is the cross correlation functions of density contrast tracers . in below",
    "we will compute the correlation of two different function like @xmath255 and @xmath256 at two different size @xmath257 , where we set @xmath258 @xmath259 where we used the conditional probability to express the joint term @xmath260 .",
    "the conditional probability can be expressed in terms of transition matrix corresponding to the steps @xmath27 and @xmath261 @xmath262 then the cross correlation of two functions @xmath263 and @xmath264 will become @xmath265 where we relate the the probability ket to the transition matrix and initial probability ket .",
    "similar to the previous section we define @xmath266 and @xmath267 as below @xmath268 which means that the cross correlation of two quantities in est can be obtained by the initial probability ket , adder delta @xmath118 and the operators @xmath266 and @xmath267 as below @xmath269 the eq.([eq : cross ] ) is the important equation which can be used to calculate each correlation function practically in n - body simulations ."
