    "over the last decades , investigations of various special classes of 0/1-polytopes ( convex hulls of sets of 0/1-points ) have not only lead to beautiful structural results on combinatorial optimization problems , but also to powerful algorithms .",
    "consequently , there has been some effort to learn more about the general class of 0/1-polytopes ( see  @xcite ) .    in the 1980 s ,",
    "e.g. , several results on the graphs of 0/1-polytopes have been obtained , most notably naddef s proof  @xcite showing that they satisfy the hirsch - conjecture .",
    "a quite spectacular achievement in  2000 was brny and pr s theorem  @xcite stating that random 0/1-polytopes ( within a certain range of vertex numbers ) have super - exponentially ( in the dimension ) many facets .",
    "their proof is based on the methods developed in the early 1990 s by dyer , fredi , and mcdiarmid  @xcite , in order to show that the expected volume of a random @xmath11-dimensional 0/1-polytope with  @xmath12 vertices drops from ( almost ) zero to ( almost ) one very quickly with  @xmath12 passing the threshold @xmath13 .",
    "while brny and pr s result sheds some light on the highest - dimensional faces of random 0/1-polytopes , we investigate their lower dimensional faces in this paper . for a polytope  @xmath0 with  @xmath12 vertices and some @xmath14 $ ] ( with @xmath15:=\\{1,2,\\dots,\\lfloor a\\rfloor\\}$ ] ) , we call @xmath16 the _ @xmath4-face density _ of  @xmath0 , where @xmath17 is the number of @xmath4-dimensional faces of  @xmath0 . clearly , we have @xmath18 , and @xmath19 holds if and only if  @xmath0 is @xmath20-neighbourly in the usual polytope theoretical sense ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath21-face density @xmath22 is the density of the graph of  @xmath0 . in this case , a threshold result for random 0/1-polytopes has recently been obtained in  @xcite . however , for specific classes of 0/1-polytopes , high @xmath4-face densities have been observed also for larger values of  @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the cut - polytopes of complete graphs have @xmath23-face density equal to one ( and thus , also @xmath21-face density equal to one ) , i.e. , every triple of vertices makes a triangle - face ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the cut - polytopes of complete graphs have @xmath24 vertices .    here , we obtain that there is a sharp threshold for the @xmath4-face density of random 0/1-polytopes for all ( fixed )  @xmath4 .",
    "the threshold values nicely extend the results for @xmath10 , while the proof becomes more involved and needs a heavier machinery ( the one developed in the above mentioned paper by dyer , fredi , and mcdiarmid ) . as a pay - back ,",
    "the proof , however , reveals several interesting insights into the geometry of ( random ) 0/1-polytopes .",
