    "the hamiltonian of the system in the second quantization representation reads : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "this interaction requires that we specify a regularization procedure , which we do by introducing a momentum cut - off @xmath26 ( thus requiring all two - body matrix elements to vanish if the relative momentum of the incoming particles exceeds the cut - off ) .",
    "once this cut - off is imposed , the value of the bare coupling @xmath27 can be tuned to fix the value of the physical renormalized coupling , which in this case will be the s - wave scattering length @xmath2 .",

    "the representation of the hamiltonian on the lattice has been obtained by noticing that two terms representing the kinetic and interaction energy are local in momentum and coordinate spaces , respectively .",

    "[ dispersionrelation ] , the dispersion relation that results from the second difference formula deviates significantly from @xmath106 behavior already at @xmath107 and as a result the number of physically meaningful available states is only @xmath108 of the whole phase space .",
