    "a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) consists of a massive ob - type star and a compact x - ray source , a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "the x - ray source is powered by accretion of wind material , though in some systems mass transfer takes place through roche - lobe overflow ; the compact stars in the latter systems are surrounded by an accretion disk . since wind accretion plays an important role , in practice only an ob supergiant or a be - star companion have a strong enough stellar wind to result in observable x - ray emission . in a be / x - ray binary",
    "the x - ray source is only observed when the neutron star moves through the dense be - star disk at periatron passage .",
    "about 75% of the known hmxbs are be / x - ray binaries , although this is a lower limit given their transient character .",
    "chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1998 ) derived the proper motions for a sample of hmxbs from _ hipparcos _ measurements .",
    "the four ob - supergiant hmxbs for which proper motions are available ( 0114 + 65 , 0900 - 40 [ vela x-1 ] , 1700 - 37 and cyg x-1 ) have relatively large peculiar tangential velocities .",
    "some corrections to the values given by these authors are needed ( cf .",
    "steele et al .",
    "1998 , kaper et al . 1999 ) .",
    "taking these into account ( table 1 ) the mean peculiar velocity of these systems is @xmath3 .",
    "it was already known that the ob - supergiant system of 1538 - 52 ( qv nor ) has a peculiar radial velocity of about 90 with respect to its local standard of rest ( crampton et al .",
    "1978 ; gies & bolton 1986 ; van oijen 1989 ) .",
    "for the 13 be / x - ray binaries with measured proper motions chevalier & ilovaisky found peculiar tangential velocities ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , with an average of @xmath6 . again , after corrections ( see sect.2 ) and excluding the oe systems x  per ( 0352 + 309 ) and v725  tau ( 0535 + 262 ) , one finds for the genuine be / x - ray binary a slightly higher value of @xmath7 .",
    "we would like to point out here that these mean values are in good agreement with the runaway velocities of these two types of systems predicted on the basis of simple `` conservative '' evolutionary models ( van den heuvel 1983 , 1985 , 1994 ; habets 1985 ; van den heuvel & rappaport 1987 ) and even better agreement is obtained when mass is not conserved in the transfer process ( portegies zwart 2000 ) .",
    "the effect of sudden mass loss during the supernova explosion is taken into account and in a massive binary this is the dominant contribution to the runaway velocity ; a random kick velocity of a few hundred imparted to the neutron star at birth ( see e.g.  hartman 1997 ) has only a small effect , as the kick s impulse has to be distributed over the entire massive ( @xmath8 ) system .",
    "( see portegies zwart & van den heuvel 1999 , for arguments in favor of kicks ) .",
    "therefore , in first - order approximation , these kicks can be neglected in calculating the runaway velocities of hmxbs , but _ not _ in calculating their orbital eccentricities ( see sects . 3.4 and 3.5 ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to give a quantitative assessment of the above - mentioned conjectures .",
    "it should be noted here that five be - star systems in the be / x - ray binary sample studied by chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1998 ) are of spectral type b4  ve or later ( masses @xmath9 ) .",
    "the companions of these stars might be white dwarfs instead of neutron stars .",
    "therefore , a supernova explosion is not necessarily the reason for their ( excess ) space velocity , which , in any case , is relatively small",
    ". it may be due to the typical random velocities observed in young stellar systems .",
    "leaving these late - type be / x - ray binaries out does not result in a significant change in the observed mean peculiar velocity of the be - systems .",
    "furthermore , there is some doubt concerning the use of the distances based on _ hipparcos _ parallaxes of several of the other be - systems , as these distances differ very much from the distances determined in other ways , e.g. by using reddening etc .",
    "( steele et al . 1998 ) . in sect .",
    "2 we therefore critically examine the distances and proper motions of all the systems with be companions . in sects . 3.1 and 3.2",
    "we present an analytical calculation of the expected runaway velocities and orbital eccentricities of typical ob - supergiant and be hmxbs , on the basis of the standard evolutionary models for these systems , adopting conservative mass transfer during phases of mass exchange , and including the effects of stellar - wind mass loss for the ob - supergiant systems . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the effect of non - conservative mass transfer on the runaway velocity and in sect . 5.1",
    "for the be / x - ray binaries with known orbital eccentricities . we calculate which kick velocities should be imparted to the neutron stars of be / x - ray binaries in order to produce their , on average , large orbital eccentricities ( since the mass - loss effects alone can not produce these ) . in sect .",
    "5.2 , as an alternative , we compare the observed runaway velocities and orbital eccentricities of the be / x - ray binaries with those expected on the basis of symmetric mass ejection and show that without kicks their combination of high orbital eccentricities and low space velocities can not be explained .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "the 4 ob - supergiant systems in the _ hipparcos _ sample of chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1998 ) have distances larger than 1 kpc , which is too remote for a reliable parallax determination . for these systems they estimated the distances based on the spectral type , visual magnitude and reddening , and eventually the strength and velocity of interstellar absorption features , etc . after correcting for the peculiar solar motion and differential galactic rotation",

    "1998 ) the _ hipparcos _ proper motions result in the peculiar tangential velocities listed in table  1 .",
    "chevalier & ilovaisky give a mean peculiar tangential velocity of @xmath10 .",
    "we derive a similar value of @xmath11  .",
    "for the be - systems , chevalier & ilovaisky use the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes to determine the distances .",
    "for some systems this leads to very surprising results .",
    "in particular , steele et al .",
    "( 1998 ) point out that for the system of 0236 + 610 ( lsa + @xmath12 ) the _ hipparcos _ parallax leads to a ten times smaller distance than the distance estimated from the spectral type and reddening .",
    "these authors convincingly show that for this system the distance estimate based on the _ hipparcos _ parallax can not be correct ; the distance of the system must be of order 1.8  kpc instead of the 177  pc determined from the _ hipparcos _ parallax .",
    "similarly , from a variety of criteria they find that for a0535 + 262 the distance must be @xmath13  kpc , instead of the 300  pc determined from the _ hipparcos _ parallax .",
    "steele et al . point out that for both systems the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes are smaller than 3 times their probable ( measurement ) error , and are therefore not reliable . in such a case one can not reliably use the _ hipparcos _ parallax to determine the distance . with the _ hipparcos _ distances the ob - star companions of 0236 + 610 and 0535 + 262 would become highly underluminous for their spectral types , and",
    "would be very peculiar stars , as was already noticed by chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , using alternative distance criteria , their absolute luminosities become perfectly normal for their spectral types .",
    "this gives confidence that the latter distances are more reliable .",
    "the systems including a be star with spectral type later than b4  v ( mass @xmath14 ) may well have white dwarfs instead of neutron stars as companions ( portegies zwart 1995 ) . therefore , their space velocity is not necessarily caused by a supernova explosion , which is the scenario we exploit in this paper . excluding these systems , the observed mean peculiar velocity hardly changes ( @xmath15  in stead of @xmath16 , excluding x  per and v725  tau ) , and since the nature of their compact companions is not known anyway",
    "( e.g. no x - ray pulsations observed which would identify the compact star as a neutron star ) , we decided to leave them in the calculation of the mean peculiar velocity .",

    "iii - ive , 27  ) and v725  tau ( 0535 + 262 , o9.7  iie , 97  ) are relatively high ; their early spectral types suggest that they have masses comparable to those of the ob supergiants , so that , like the ob - supergiant systems , they would also originate from relatively massive binary systems . in table  1",
    "we list the peculiar tangential velocity for each individual system and calculate the average for different subsamples .",
    "we left out the be  star @xmath17  cas , because its x - ray binary nature is not clear ; furthermore , its x - ray spectrum is consistent with that of a white dwarf ( haberl 1995 ) .    for the systems 0236 + 610 , 0535 + 262 , 1036 - 565 and 1145 - 619 the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes yield absolute visual magnitudes very different from those expected on the basis of the ob - spectral types of the stars . in these cases , the _ hipparcos _ parallax measurements are less than three times their probable errors and thus not reliable . for these stars we therefore used the distances determined from spectral type and reddening , which yield absolute visual magnitudes consistent with their spectral types .",
    "we rederived the peculiar tangential velocities relative to the local restframe from the _ hipparcos _ proper motions ( cf .",
    "kaper et al . 1999 ) .",
    "table  1 lists the peculiar tangential velocity corrected for the peculiar solar motion and differential galactic rotation for three different distances ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , following gies & bolton 1986 ) . the uncertainty in distance ( and",
    "thus in peculiar motion ) is difficult to estimate ; therefore , we calculated the space velocity for different values of the distance .",
    "the peculiar tangential velocities for the hmxbs discussed in clark & dolan ( 1999 ) are identical to ours for the ob - supergiant systems , though they find different values for the be / x - ray binaries x  per ( @xmath21  , @xmath22  pc ) , v725  tau ( @xmath23  , @xmath24  kpc ) , and 1145 - 619 ( @xmath25  , @xmath26  pc ) .",
    "obviously , the precise values for the peculiar motion depend on the adopted model for the galactic rotation ; we used the formalism employed in comern et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for the ob - supergiant systems in the sample of chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1998 )",
    "also the radial velocities are available from literature .",
    "this is not the case for the be / x - ray binary systems .",
    "therefore , we only consider the two components of the tangential velocity for the comparison of the kinematic properties of the two groups .",
    "the table shows that , leaving the two o - emission systems out , the be / x - ray binaries have low space velocities : @xmath16  .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : model ]",
    "in the above it was assumed that the case b mass transfer was conservative in all systems .",
    "for the be - systems this `` conservative '' assumption seems confirmed quite straightforwardly as the be nature is interpreted by the accretion of angular momentum and thus of mass . on the other hand , for the ob - supergiant x - ray binaries",
    "several authors ( starting with flannery and ulrich 1977 for the cen x-3 system ) have pointed out that certainly in part of the systems the mass transfer has been non - conservative , and there is a considerable evolution for massive close binaries altogether ( de loore & de greeve 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , close wolf - rayet binaries with high mass ratios @xmath27 such as cq cep ( @xmath28 days , @xmath29 ) and cx cep ( @xmath30 days , @xmath31 ) can not have been produced by conservative evolution , and just these systems are the progenitors of the ob - supergiant x - ray binaries ( cf .",
    "van den heuvel 1994 ) .",
    "the amount of mass lost from the system during the transfer will depend on the initial mass ratio of the system .",
    "for small the companion will accrete little and most of the envelope mass of the primary will be lost from the system . on the other hand , for large little mass",
    "will be lost from the system .",
    "therefore , in order to study the effect of mass and angular momentum loss on the runaway velocity , we assume as a first approximation that the fraction @xmath32 of the primary s envelope which is accreted by the companion star is proportional to the initial mass ratio ( portegies zwart 1995 ) @xmath33 after mass transfer the secondary mass then becomes @xmath34    the gas lost by the donor leaves with low velocity but gains angular momentum via the interaction with the companion star .",
    "it finally leaves the binary system via the second lagrangian point @xmath35 , carrying specific angular momentum with it ( de loore & de greve 1992 ) . the specific angular momentum of this lost matter is considerably larger than what is lost in the specific amount of angular momentum in the stellar wind ( given by eq.[eq:5 ] ) , see for example soberman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we assume that the mass that leaves the system carries a fraction @xmath36 of the specific angular momentum of the binary .",
    "we can then write the change in orbital separation due to mass transfer as @xmath37 and use it as an alternative for eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "following portegies zwart ( 1995 ) we use @xmath38 .",
    "eq.([eq:8 ] ) then becomes : @xmath39    the result of this calculation is presented as the dotted lines in fig .  1 .",
    "the small number near each @xmath40 indicates the mass of the visible component , which is smaller than if mass transfer would proceed conservatively .",
    "one observes that for the same mass of the visible component of the binary , the runaway velocity of the ob - system is between 50 and 100 per - cent larger than in the conservative case .",
    "the higher velocity of the binary is mainly caused by the smaller orbital separation at the moment of the supernova .",
    "we thus see , from this simple numerical experiment , that non - conservative mass transfer makes the difference in runaway velocity between the two types of high mass x - ray binaries considerably larger .",
    "in the case of spherically symmetric mass ejection the orbital eccentricity induced by the mass loss is ( cf .",
    "hills 1983 ) : @xmath41 one expects that because of the extensive mass transfer and the fact that before the mass transfer the primary was a ( sub)giant , the orbits just prior to the explosions are circular . hence , in case of spherically symmetric mass ejection , one expects the eccentricities of the be / x - ray binaries simply to be given by eq .",
    "( 19 ) .",
    "table 3 shows that for the be / x - ray binaries resulting from systems with an initial primary mass of 10 , the orbital eccentricities expected on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) range from 0.045 to 0.060 . for systems resulting from binaries with primaries of 12 ,",
    "the eccentricities range from 0.073 to 0.096 .",
    "it should be noted that these are , in fact , overestimates , since we ignored case bb mass transfer , which would still have somewhat reduced these values .",
    "orbital eccentricities are known for only five be / x - ray binaries , as is listed in table  3 .",
    "they range from 0.3 to @xmath42 , with an average of about 0.5 . for the two long - period systems , 1145 - 619 and 1258 - 613 ,",
    "the orbital eccentricities have not yet been measured , but a rough estimate of their values can be made as follows .",
    "both systems are recurrent transients , with outbursts occurring once per orbit , when the be star is active , presumably when the stars are near periastron .",
    "the same is true for the systems 0115 + 63 , v0331 + 53 and ex02030 + 375 when their be - stars are in an active phase . for the latter systems one calculates from their orbital periods and eccentricities that within 20 percent their periastron distances are the same",
    "apparently , this is the periastron distance required for triggering an outburst when the be - star is in an active phase .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to assume that the same is true for 1145 - 619 and 1258 - 613 . using this , one finds the latter systems to have eccentricities of between 0.75 and 0.83 , and between 0.70 and 0.80 , respectively . to be conservative",
    ", we have indicated this in table 3 as : @xmath43 .",
    "two more systems consisting of a b - star and a neutron star are known : the binary radio pulsars psrj 1259 - 63 and psrj 0045 - 7319 .",
    "these have very eccentric orbits as indicated in table  3 .",
    "so , in total we have nine b - star plus neutron star systems with measured or estimated orbital eccentricities .",
    "references to the orbital parameters of these systems are indicated in the table .",
    "observations show that all binaries including detached ones with orbital periods shorter than 10 days have circular orbits , whereas detached systems with longer orbital periods do not .",
    "this suggests that in systems with orbital periods shorter than 10 days tidal forces are effective in circularizing the orbits on a timescale considerably shorter than the lifetimes of the components of the binary , whereas in wider systems they apparently are not . since the be / x - ray binaries are detached systems ( cf .",
    "van den heuvel & rappaport 1987 ; van den heuvel 1994 ) and have orbital periods longer than 16 days , it is not surprising that their orbits have not yet been circularized .",
    "the lifetime of a be / x - ray binary is expected to be of the order of a few million years up to about 10myr , the lifetime of the be companion of the neutron star .",
    "the timescale for tidal circularization for main - sequence binaries with orbital periods @xmath44 days is at least a few tens of myr ( see zahn 1977 , kochanek 1992 ) .",
    "therefore it is unlikely to catch the binary in the circularization process .",
    "therefore , we expect that the eccentricities for the be / x - ray binaries in table  3 are still close to those just after the supernova explosion",
    ". the orbits of the high - mass x - ray binaries with orbital periods @xmath45 days are all practically circularized by tidal effects .",
    "it should be noted that if the eccentricities of the be - systems had resulted from spherically symmetric supernova mass ejection , the amounts of mass ejected in their supernovae should have been very large , of order 4 to over 7 solar masses ( see for example iben & tutukov 1998 ) . since in the case of symmetric mass ejection the orbital eccentricity and runaway velocity are directly proportional to each other ( see eqs . [ 10 ] and [ 14 ] ) , also the induced runaway velocities should have been much larger than observed .",
    "for example , induction of an eccentricity 0.5 with a symmetric explosion requires 1/3 of the system mass to be ejected in the explosion . with",
    "a be star of 12 , as is representative for a typical b0.5  ve star , and a neutron star mass of 1.4 , the initial system mass in this case must have been 20.1 , implying an ejected amount of mass of 6.7 . in order to obtain a post - supernova orbital period of about 30days , as is typical for",
    "many be / x - ray binaries , the initial orbital period in this example must have been around 11days . with this initial period , and 6.7",
    "explosively ejected , the induced runaway velocity  would be @xmath46(see the equations in sect .",
    "3.3 ) , which is advariant with the observed velocities .",
    "similarly , if the induced eccentricity would be 0.3 , one finds that for the same final system mass and orbital period , the runaway velocity induced by the explosion would have been about 45 .",
    "as these velocities are some 5 , respectively 2.5 times larger than the mean excess space velocity of 19  [ @xmath47 of the be / x - ray binaries , it is clear that the orbital eccentricities of the be / x - ray binaries can not be due purely to symmetric mass ejection in the supernova explosion .",
    "the only way to obtain both a low runaway velocity of the system and the high orbital eccentricities listed in table  3 is by having a small amount of mass ejected in the supernova , in combination with a velocity kick of order 60 to 250  imparted to the neutron star at birth .",
    "we describe below how these required kick velocities were calculated .",
    "the randomly directed kick hardly changes the runaway velocity of the system , as the impulse of the kick imparted to the neutron star is shared by the entire system ( with a mass of order 15 solar masses in the case of the be / x - ray binaries ) , and thus the kick velocity is `` diluted '' to an extra velocity of the system of only 4 to 16 , in a random direction . adding this velocity quadratically ( because of its random direction ) to the velocity of between 5 and 21  imparted to the systems purely by the mass loss ( fig .",
    "1 ) , one obtains mean runaway velocities of between 6 and 21  for a 60  kick and between 17 and 26  for a 250  kick .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the observed mean excess space velocities of be / x - ray binaries of @xmath48(@xmath49 times their average peculiar tangential velocities ) .",
    "we calculated the minimum kick velocities that have to be imparted to the neutron star during the supernova explosion in order to obtain the presently observed orbital eccentricities of the be - systems in table  3 .",
    "we used the equations derived by wijers et al .",
    "the minimum required kick velocitiy is the one that is imparted in the orbital plane in the direction of motion of the pre - supernova star ( assuming the initial orbit was circular ) .",
    "we assumed in these calculations that the b  stars have a mass of @xmath50 , as corresponds to a b0 - 1 main - sequence star , and that the neutron star has a mass of @xmath51 .",
    "( for b - star masses in the range @xmath52 the required minimum runaway velocities do not differ by more than @xmath53 10 per cent from the values for @xmath54 ) .",
    "the table shows that the required minimum kick velocities range from about 50 to about 200 . assuming the real kick velocities to be randomly distributed , the required kicks become @xmath55 times larger , and range from about 60 to about 250 .",
    "we conclude from the above that the combination of low mean space velocity of the be / x - ray binaries and large mean orbital eccentricity provides unequivocal evidence for the existence of velocity kicks imparted to neutron stars at their birth .    an alternative way to approach",
    "the problem of the orbital eccentricities is to calculate , from the measured mean runaway velocities of be / x - ray systems , what orbital eccentricity these systems should have had , were this runaway velocity imparted by purely symmetric mass ejection .",

    "<S> the recent finding by chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1998 ) from _ hipparcos _ observations that ob - supergiant x - ray binaries have relatively large runaway velocities ( mean peculiar tangential velocity @xmath0  ) , whereas be / x - ray binaries have low runaway velocities ( @xmath1 ) , provides confirmation of the current models for the formation of these two types of systems . </S>",
    "<S> these predict a difference in runaway velocity of this order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this difference basically results from the variation of the fractional helium core mass as a function of stellar mass , in combination with the conservation of orbital angular momentum during the mass transfer phase that preceded the formation of the compact object in the system . </S>",
    "<S> this combination results into : ( i ) systematically narrower pre - supernova orbits in the ob - supergiant systems than in the be - systems , and ( ii ) a larger fractional amount of mass ejected in the supernovae in high - mass systems relative to systems of lower mass . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of possible kick velocities imparted to neutron stars at birth , this combination leads to a considerable difference in average runaway velocity between these two groups . if one includes the possibility for non - conservative mass transfer the predicted difference between the runaway velocity of the two groups becomes even more pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> the observed low runaway velocities of the be / x - ray binaries confirm that in most cases not more than 1 to 2  was ejected in the supernovae that produced their neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> this , in combination with the on average large orbital eccentricities of these systems , indicates that their neutron stars must have received a velocity kick in the range 60 - 250  at birth . </S>",
    "<S> the considerable runaway velocity of cygnus x-1 ( @xmath2 ) shows that also with the formation of a black hole considerable mass ejection takes place .    </S>",
