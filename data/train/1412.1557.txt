    "the study of the meson properties in nuclear medium is one of the most exciting topics in the hadron physics .",
    "the meson property is strongly related to the non - perturbative natures of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "especially the @xmath0 meson has a strong connection to the u@xmath2(1 ) anomaly and the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . in the ordinary explanation",
    ", the large mass of the @xmath0 meson should be attributed to the explicit breaking of the u@xmath2(1 ) symmetry due to the anomaly . however , the chiral symmetry breaking is also responsible for the generation of the @xmath0 mass @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , they have argued the degeneracy of the pseudoscalar singlet and octet mesons when chiral symmetry is fully restored in three flavor system independently of the u@xmath2(1 ) symmetry .",
    "thus , both the u@xmath2(1 ) anomaly and the chiral symmetry breaking are essential for the generation of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the effective restoration of the u@xmath2(1 ) symmetry is also pointed out from the viewpoint of the instanton dynamics @xcite .",
    "the in - medium properties of the @xmath0 meson concerned with the in - medium u@xmath2(1 ) symmetry is interested in for a long time ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the recent interest of the in - medium @xmath0 property is related with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the partial restoration of chiral symmetry means the reduction of the quark condensate in low density systems . the in - medium quark condensate @xmath5 is given as @xmath6 in small density systems @xcite .",
    "some experiments of the pion - nucleus system suggest about 35% reduction of the quark condensate at the normal nuclear density @xcite . assuming small change of the @xmath7 meson mass in the nuclear medium",
    ", we expect large mass reduction of the @xmath0 mass in the nuclear medium . in the finite temperature and density system ,",
    "there are some model calculations focusing on the @xmath0 mass @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interpretation of the mass reduction suggests possible @xmath0-mesonic nuclei as the attractive optical potential in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "there are some analyses of the experimental data related to the @xmath0 properties . from the analysis of the transparency ratio , the optical potential of the @xmath0 meson",
    "is estimated @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 scattering length is extracted from the @xmath8 reaction @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our work is to study the @xmath0-optical potential . in this study , we analyze the @xmath1 system with the linear sigma model .",
    "advantages to use the linear sigma model in this study are as follows ; it shares common symmetry feature to qcd , such as the three flavor chiral symmetry and the u@xmath2(1 ) anomaly .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its partial restoration in the nuclear medium . here",
    "we assume that the chiral symmetry is partially restored at the normal nuclear density with 35% reduction of the quark condensate .",
    "the nucleon degree of freedom can be implemented into the linear sigma model as a fundamental field .    in the following sections , we explain the model setup and show the results of our analysis of the @xmath1 system .",

    "the baryon field is assumed to belong to the @xmath14 representation of the su(3)@xmath15 su(3)@xmath16 group and here we show only the relevant nucleon field and its coupling to the non - strange mesons . in eq .",
    "( [ mq ] ) , we assume the isospin symmetry with @xmath17 , and introduce the explicit flavor symmetry breaking with @xmath18 .",
    "due to the flavor symmetry breaking , the observed @xmath7 and @xmath0 are linear combinations of the su(3 ) eigenstate , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the free parameters contained in the lagrangian , @xmath21 , are determined to reproduce the observed meson masses and decay constants and the 35% reduction of the quark condensate at the normal nuclear density .",
    "the nuclear medium is introduced with the nucleon mean - field approximation .    from this lagrangian",
    ", we can obtain the @xmath1 scattering amplitude . at the tree level ,",
    "the diagrams contributing to the scattering amplitude are shown in fig .",

    "the parameter @xmath30 is the coefficient of the determinant term , so it reflects the u@xmath2(1 ) anomaly .",
    "the @xmath1 transition to the @xmath3 channel is relatively suppressed by the larger octet scalar - meson mass compared with @xmath25 .",
    "evaluating the amplitude at the @xmath1 threshold , we find that the interaction is comparably strong to the weinberg - tomozawa interaction in the @xmath31 channel with @xmath32 where there exists the @xmath33 as a quasi - bound state @xcite .",
    "in this section , we explain the analysis of the @xmath1 system and show the result of our calculation .",
    "we analyze the @xmath1 system with the analogous method to the @xmath31 system @xcite ; the scattering amplitude from the tree - level chiral perturbation theory is used as the interaction kernel .",
    "the divergence of the loop integral is renormalized with the natural renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "this means that we eliminate the dynamics other than the @xmath0 and nucleon with this scheme .",

    "@xmath40 is the two - body green s function and its divergence is renormalized with the natural renormalization scheme .",
    "now , we use the scattering amplitude obtained from the linear sigma model at the @xmath1 threshold as the interaction kernel .",
