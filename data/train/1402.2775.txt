    "in finite dimensional spaces , depth functions provide a center - outward ordering of the points in the sample space relative to a given probability distribution , and various depth functions for probability distributions in @xmath1 have been proposed in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for some extensive review ) .",
    "several desirable properties of depth functions have been listed in @xcite , and these properties have been utilized in developing several statistical procedures .",
    "depth - weighted l - type location estimators like trimmed means have been considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "depth functions have also been used to construct statistical classifiers ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . another useful application of depths is in constructing depth contours ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , which determine central and outlying regions of a probability distribution .",
    "these contours and regions are useful in outlier detection . + with the recent advancement of scientific techniques and measurement devices , we increasingly come across data that have dimensions much larger than the sample sizes .",
    "such data can not be handled using standard multivariate techniques due to their high dimensionalities and low sample sizes .",
    "a common approach for handling such data is to embed them into suitable infinite dimensional spaces ( e.g. , data lying in function spaces ) .",
    "half - space depth ( hd ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , projection depth ( pd ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and spatial depth ( sd ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , which were originally defined for data in finite dimensional spaces , can have natural extensions into infinite dimensional spaces as we shall see in subsequent sections .",
    "+ @xcite defined a notion of depth , which is called integrated data depth ( i d ) , in function spaces .",
    "@xcite used this depth function to construct trimmed means , and they showed that the empirical i d is a strongly and uniformly consistent estimator of its population counterpart .",
    "these authors used i d to categorize extremal and central curves in the data consisting of @xmath2 curves used to build the nasdaq @xmath2 index .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced two different notions of data depth for functional data , and they called them band depth ( bd ) and half - region depth ( hrd ) .",
    "these authors have used these depth functions for detecting the central and the peripheral sample curves of some real datasets including daily temperature curves for canadian weather stations and gene expression data for lymphoblastic leukemia . trimmed",
    "means based on bd have been discussed in @xcite , and they used it to construct classifiers based on certain distance measures .",
    "the distance of an observation from a class was defined either as the distance from the trimmed mean of the class or as a trimmed weighted average of the distances from observations in the class .",
    "the procedure was implemented to classify the well - known berkeley growth data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also proposed a rank based test for two - population problems using bd , and they used the procedure to test the equality of curves obtained by plotting relative diameters along the y - axis against relative heights along the x - axis for two groups of trees as well as the berkeley growth data .",
    "these authors proved that the empirical versions of both of bd and hrd converge uniformly almost surely to their population counterparts .",
    "however , it was observed by them that both the depth functions tend to take small values if the sample consists of irregular ( non - smooth ) curves that cross one another often . to overcome this problem , @xcite proposed modified versions of these depth functions , called modified band depth ( mbd ) and modified half- region depth ( mhrd ) , using the `` proportion of time '' a sample curve spends inside a band or a half - region , respectively . + it was observed in @xcite that the maximum value of simplicial depth of a point in @xmath1 with respect to any angularly symmetric absolutely continuous probability distribution is @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , the simplicial depth of any point in @xmath1 under such a distribution converges to zero as @xmath4 grows to infinity . this observation motivated us to critically investigate the behaviour of the above - mentioned depth functions for some standard probability models that are widely used for data in infinite dimensional spaces .",
    "it will be shown that infinite dimensional extensions of hd and pd have degenerate behaviour in infinite dimensional spaces . moreover ,",
    "both bd and hrd suffer from degeneracy for some standard probability models in function spaces .",
    "however , their modified versions as well as i d do not suffer from any such degenerate behaviour for similar probability distributions in function spaces .",
    "we also extend the notion of sd into infinite dimensional spaces , and it is shown that such an extension leads to a well - behaved and statistically useful depth function for many infinite dimensional probability distributions .",
    "in this section , we shall consider depth functions that are defined using linear projections of a random element @xmath5 .",
    "we begin by recalling that in finite dimensional spaces , the definitions of both of hd and pd involve distributions of linear projections of @xmath5 .",
    "an extension of hd into banach spaces has been considered in @xcite .",

    "we shall first consider the space @xmath17 equipped with its usual norm and the associated borel @xmath7-field .",

    "further , since @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 , and hence , @xmath38 with probability one .",
    "we now state a theorem that establishes a degeneracy result for both of hd and pd under appropriate conditions on the distribution of @xmath39 .",
    "[ thm2.1 ] let @xmath40 denote the probability distribution of @xmath5 in @xmath17 .",

    "it is obvious that for any gaussian probability measure @xmath40 , the assumptions in the preceding theorem hold .",
    "recently , it has been shown in @xcite that hd has degenerate behaviour when the probability distribution of @xmath50 is such that @xmath51 are independent random variables satisfying suitable moment conditions .",
    "note that if @xmath50 is a sequence of independent random variables with zero means , we have @xmath52 . in that case",
    ", if we choose @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the moment assumption in the above theorem implies that @xmath55 , which is the condition assumed in theorem 3 in @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the above result is actually true whenever @xmath56 with probability one ( see the proof in section [ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "this , for instance , holds whenever @xmath39 is a sequence of independent non - degenerate random variables .",
    "the moment and the mixing assumptions on @xmath39 stated in the theorem are only sufficient to ensure @xmath56 with probability one , but by no means they are necessary .",
    "+ the degeneracy of hd and pd stated in the previous theorem is not restricted to separable hilbert spaces only .",
    "let us consider the space @xmath57 $ ] of continuous functions defined on @xmath58 $ ] along with its supremum norm and the associated borel @xmath7-field .",
    "recall that the dual space of @xmath57 $ ] is the space of finite signed borel measures on @xmath58 $ ] equipped with its total variation norm .",
    "the following result shows the degeneracy of hd and pd for a class of probability measures in @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "[ thm2.2 ] consider a random element @xmath5 in @xmath57 $ ] having a gaussian distribution with a positive definite covariance kernel , and let @xmath40 denote the distribution of @xmath5 .",
    "then , @xmath47 for all @xmath10 in a subset of @xmath57 $ ] with @xmath40-measure one . here",
    "we denote the half - space and the projection depths of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath40 by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , and we choose @xmath14 as the mean and @xmath15 as the standard deviation in the definition of @xmath49 .",
    "the degeneracy of hd stated in theorems [ thm2.1 ] and [ thm2.2 ] can be interpreted as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be either @xmath17 or @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "then , for any @xmath9 , we can choose a hyperplane in @xmath6 through @xmath10 in such a way that the probability content of one of the half - spaces is as small as we want .",
    "on the other hand , the degeneracy result about pd in the above theorems implies that one can find an element @xmath59 so that the distance of @xmath19 from the mean of @xmath16 relative to the standard deviation of @xmath16 will be as large as desired .",
    "such degenerate behaviour of hd and pd clearly implies that they are not suitable for center - outward ordering of the points in @xmath6 , and these depth functions can not be used to determine the central and the outlying regions for many probability measures including gaussian distributions in @xmath6 .",
    "one reason for such degeneracy is that the dual space @xmath12 is too large , and its unit ball is not compact ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it will be appropriate to note here that unlike what we have mentioned about simplicial depth in the introduction , it is easy to verify that the maximum values of hd and pd for any symmetric probability distribution in @xmath6 such that any linear function has a continuous distribution are @xmath60 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath61 , respectively , and these maximum values are achieved at the centre of symmetry of the probability distribution .",
    "in other words , although hd and pd have degenerate behaviour in @xmath6 , the half - space median and the projection median remain well - defined for symmetric distributions in @xmath6 .",
    "+ let us now consider a simple classification problem , which involves class distributions in @xmath6 ( @xmath62 or @xmath57 $ ] as in the preceding paragraph ) , where the two classes differ only by a shift in the location .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath63 denote random elements from the two class distributions , where @xmath63 has the same distribution as @xmath64 for some fixed @xmath65 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath66 and @xmath67 the half - space depth functions computed using the distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "similarly , let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be the projection depth functions based on the distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath63 , respectively . then , under the assumptions of theorem [ thm2.1 ] or [ thm2.2 ] , it is easy to verify using the arguments in the proofs of those theorems ( see section [ sec:5 ] ) that @xmath70 for almost every realization @xmath71 of @xmath5 and @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that neither hd nor pd is suitable for classification purpose in the space @xmath6 for such class distributions . + a modified version of tukey depth , called the random tukey depth ( rtd ) ,",

    "it is easy to see that the support of the distribution of @xmath75 is the whole of @xmath76 $ ] for gaussian and many other distributions in @xmath17 , where @xmath77 denotes an independent copy of @xmath5 .",
    "however , @xcite mentioned some theoretical and practical difficulties with rtd including the problem of choosing @xmath74 and the distribution of @xmath73 s .",
    "a depth function for probability distributions in banach spaces was introduced in @xcite , which is called integrated dual depth ( idd ) .",

    "random elements @xmath82 from a probability distribution in @xmath12 , which will be independent of @xmath5 and compute idd using @xmath83 .",
    "it can be easily shown that if @xmath80 is any standard depth function ( e.g. , hd , sd or simplicial depth ) that maps @xmath81 onto a non - degenerate interval , then for gaussian and many other distributions of @xmath5 in @xmath6 , @xmath84 will have a non - degenerate distribution with an appropriate interval as its support . however , like rtd , there are no natural guidelines available in practice for choosing the probability distribution @xmath79 in the dual space @xmath12 and the number @xmath74 of the random directions @xmath73 s .",
