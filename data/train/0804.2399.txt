    "the significant increase of the interesting properties of the solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with a periodic potential during the last decade was strongly stimulated by the application of that model in the theory of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , where the model is known also as the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the major advantage of the use of optical lattices , which constitute the physical origin of the periodic potential , is the possibility of change of their characteristics in space what stimulated studies of managing soliton dynamics by spatially inhomogeneous lattices  @xcite , by low - dimensional lattices  @xcite , by lattices with defects  @xcite , etc .",
    "independently recently there has been interest on the systematic study of nonlinear lattices  @xcite in a more general context , including not only the bec mean - field theory but also electromagnetic wave propagation in layered kerr media .",
    "subsequent studies of the interplay between linear and nonlinear lattices  @xcite have revealed more peculiarities of localized modes in such structures and unusual stability properties of plane wave solutions .",
    "search of the localized modes in all the studies mentioned above was carried out within the framework of approximate and numerical methods , as the models , in general case , do now allow for exact solutions .",
    "however , recently it was realized that for a number of nls models including specific type of periodic potentials , exact periodic solutions can be constructed  @xcite , what can be done in a systematic manner , using a kind of inverse engineering and starting with a given periodic field distribution  @xcite .",
    "we want also to mention the refs .",
    "@xcite , where different methods to find exact solutions to nonlinear schrdinger equations were studied .",
    "even greater progress was achieved in constructing exact solutions , and in particular of integrable models , of the nls equation with time dependent coefficients ( see e.g.  @xcite for the work devoted to equations of the nls - type ) , and for the stationary gp equation with a potential and varying nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "however , all mentioned models allowing for exact solutions look sometimes rather artificial , for example models with exact periodic solutions must be infinite or subject to cyclic boundary conditions and models with trap potentials require specific laws of time variations of the coefficients . despite those difficulties , they have two important advantages the first being that they are still experimentally feasible , and the second being that they allow for exact solutions , thus ruling out any ambiguity in interpretation of the physical phenomena .    returning to the nls models with spatially periodic coefficients , we observe that no exact _ localized _ solutions have been reported , so far ( the only work to our knowledge is the analytical approach for constructing sufficiently narrow pulses , recently elaborated in  @xcite ) .",
    "this is the main goal of this present paper to present for the first time such solutions , which can be obtained for specific types of linear and nonlinear lattices .",
    "moreover , simple analysis of the presented models and their solutions will allow us to make several conclusions about properties of the underlying linear lattices and about stabilization of localized modes by polychromatic lattices .",
    "the results presented in this work , represent the extension of the ideas elaborated in earlier publications  @xcite to the case of periodic nonlinearities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we develop the theory of similarity transformations for our model problem : the nonlinear schrdinger equation with a spatially inhomogeneous nonlinearity . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the stationary localized modes of the inhomogeneous nonlinear schrdinger equation ( inlse ) . in section 4",
    ", we present a study of the stability of such solutions . finally , in section 5",
    ", we construct explicit periodic solutions of the inlse and study their stability .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional spatially inhomogeneous nls equation @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 being respectively linear and nonlinear periodic potentials , whose periods will be required to be equal .",
    "more specifically , without loss of generality we impose the period to be @xmath4 : i.e. @xmath5 and @xmath6 , what can be always achieved by proper rescaling of variables .",
    "( it is worth to mention here that in the bec theory the choice of the period @xmath4 corresponds to the scaling where the energy is measured in the units of the recoil energy ) . in order to eliminate possible unessential constant energy shifts and bring the statement of the problem closer to the standard one we impose the requirement for the periodic potential to have a zero mean value , i.e. @xmath7 the complex field @xmath8",

    "next , being interested in solutions existing on the whole real axis and excluding singular potentials we have to restrict the analysis to functions @xmath22 in @xmath29 which do not acquire zero values and thus are sign definite .",
    "moreover since neither ( [ g - one ] ) nor ( [ syst ] ) change as @xmath22 changes the sign ( what simply reflects the phase invariance of the model ( [ eq - physical ] ) ) , in what follows we restrict the consideration to the case @xmath30 .",
    "the solution of ( [ syst ] ) is immediate : @xmath31 here we have taken into account that the constant of the first integration with respect to @xmath11 can be chosen 1 , as far as @xmath22 is still left undefined , and the second integration constant conveniently fixes the origin . thus we have @xmath32    now the coefficients in eq .",
