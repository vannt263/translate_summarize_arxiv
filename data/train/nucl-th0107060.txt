    "the underlying idea of the quark model we use is that the constituent quark mass is a consequence of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( scsb ) .",
    "then , between the chiral symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath1 1 gev ) and the confinement scale , ( @xmath2 0.2 gev ) qcd may be simulated in terms of an effective theory of constituent quarks interacting through the goldstone modes associated with the scsb .",
    "perturbative features of qcd are incorporated through the one - gluon exchange potential .",
    "a more extensive description of the quark - model hamiltonian can be found in the literature @xcite .    based on the quark model hamiltonian , two different procedures have been used in the literature to obtain baryonic interactions .",
    "the first one is the rgm .",
    "it allows to treat the inter - cluster dynamics in an exact way once the hilbert space has been fixed .",
    "the potential derived from this method contains all the nonlocalities associated with quark antisymmetry . for the present study we will make use of the @xmath0 potential derived through a lippmann - schwinger formulation of the rgm equations in momentum space @xcite .",
    "it reproduces the @xmath0 phase shifts up to 250 mev lab energy with quite a good accuracy .",
    "the second method is based on the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "it provides a clear - cut prescription for removing the nonlocalities while preserving the general properties of the interaction for lower partial waves , i.e. , those coming form quark antisymmetry .",
    "this local interaction has been widely applied to a great variety of physical problems , obtaining reasonable results . in general , the phase shifts are reproduced with a comparable accuracy to the rgm results @xcite .    in both cases , for a correct description of the @xmath3 phase shift it is necessary to take into account the coupling to the @xmath4 channel @xcite , providing the required additional attraction . in order to achieve almost phase shift equivalence between the local and nonlocal interaction models , which is mandatory",
    "if one wants to reliably judge the influence of the nonlocalities , we have done a fine tuning of the potential parameters .",
    "the results obtained for the two - body system with the local and nonlocal potentials are presented in table [ table2 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the @xmath3 and the @xmath5 phase shifts and the low - energy scattering parameters as well as the deuteron binding energy are practically the same for both potential models , and also in very good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the three - body system is solved performing a five channel fadeev calculation including the @xmath3 and @xmath5 @xmath0 partial waves as input .",
    "note that since in our model there is a coupling to the @xmath6 system , a fully consistent calculation would require the inclusion of two more three - body channels . however , their contribution to the @xmath7 binding energy is known to be rather small @xcite and therefore we neglect them for simplicity reasons .    to solve the three - body faddeev equations in momentum space",
    "we first perform a separable finite - rank expansion of the @xmath8 sector utilizing the est method @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that with a separable expansion of sufficiently high rank , reliable and accurate results on the three - body level can be achieved . in the present case it turned out that separable representations of rank 6 - 8 for @xmath9 and rank 6 for @xmath5 , are sufficient to get converged results .",
    "the results of the triton bound state calculation are summarized in table [ table4 ] .",
    "let us first emphasize that the predicted binding energies for both models are comparable to those obtained from conventional potentials of the @xmath0 interaction such as the paris , bonn , or nijmegen models @xcite . comparing the values for our local and nonlocal models",
    ", one observes that there is about 150 kev more binding for the nonlocal potential .",
    "is this the enhancement we can expect from the nonlocalities due to the quark substructure of the nucleon ? in order to answer this question we need to go back again to the @xmath0 results and scrutinize the on - shell properties carefully . for the @xmath3 partial wave",
    "the differences in the low - energy scattering parameters and in the phase shift are indeed very small , see table  [ table2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] respectively .",
    "unfortunately , for the @xmath5 partial wave the situation is much more complicated . while the deuteron binding energy and also the @xmath10 and @xmath11 phase shifts are in excellent agreement , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) this can not be said about the mixing parameter @xmath12 . in this case , it is difficult to estimate reliably the effect from the obvious deviation from phase equivalence on the triton binding energy .    however , one can clearly separate the effects from the two involved partial waves . for this purpose",
    ", we carried out additional @xmath7 calculations where we combined the @xmath3 of the local model with the @xmath5 of the nonlocal model and vice versa .",
    "corresponding results are compiled in table  [ table5 ] where we show triton binding energies ( in mev ) for different combinations of the local and nonlocal models .",
    "they strongly suggest that the nonlocalities present in the @xmath3 alone are already responsible for the enhancement of around 150 kev in the triton binding energy . the shift in the binding energy is independent of whether we use the local or nonlocal version model for the @xmath5 partial wave . on the other hand , the nonlocalities present in the @xmath5 partial wave seem to even decrease the binding energy .",
    "however , we suspect that here the effect of the nonlocalities is obscured by the fact that the two models are not strictly phase equivalent .    in summary , we have calculated the three - nucleon bound state problem utilizing @xmath0 potentials derived from a basic quark - quark interaction .",
    "one of these potentials was generated by means of the resonating group method so that nonlocalities resulting from the internal structure of the nucleon were preserved .",
    "the other potential is based on the born - oppenheimer approximation and is strictly local .",
    "these potentials are made nearly phase equivalent by fine tuning of some of the model parameters .",
    "the corresponding calculations of the triton bound state indicate that the nonlocalities resulting from the quark substructure of the nucleon yield additional attraction and , specifically , can lead to an increase of the binding energy by up to 200 kev .",
    "thus , the effect of those nonlocalities on the three - nucleon binding energy is certainly appreciable .",
    "in particular , it is of the same magnitude as the one resulting from nonlocalities that occur in the meson - exchange picture of the @xmath0 interaction ."
