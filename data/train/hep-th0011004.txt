    "although all experimentally observed particles are either bosons or fermions , the general principles of quantum mechanics do not prohibit existence of particles obeying other types of statistics @xcite .",
    "the motivation to consider an exotic statistics is that it may provide an _ effective _ description of the dynamics of particles if their interaction is so strong that the available occupancy for a given state depends on the number of particles already present in the state @xcite .",
    "an exotic statistics can also arise if particles possess a hidden internal degree of freedom that is invisible in the hamiltonian but that can become dynamically relevant .",
    "finally , an exotic statistics can emerge in description of physical models in one or two spatial dimensions .",
    "the reason is that in this case the multi - particle wave function is not necessarily even or odd and particles ( anyons ) may obey a fractional statistics @xcite .",
    "moreover , in low - dimensional theories the exchange statistics of the fields present in a hamiltonian is not directly related to the exclusion statistics of the corresponding particles .",
    "for instance , although particles in the one - dimensional real coupling affine toda field theories ( atft ) are bosons , one has to impose the pauli principle on their momenta in the thermodynamic bethe ansatz analysis in order to obtain correct values of corresponding central charges @xcite .",
    "another example is the conformal field theory , where quasi - particle spectra can be constructed with use of an exotic exclusion statistics @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to introduce an exotic statistics is attributed to g.  gentile @xcite , who proposed an intermediate statistics , in which at most @xmath1 indistinguishable particles can occupy a given state .",
    "this intermediate statistics interpolates between fermions and bosons , that are recovered for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . a decade after gentile s work h.s .",
    "green introduced the parafermi statistics @xcite that also fixes maximal occupancy for a given state . since then , various aspects of systems governed by the gentile or parafermi statistics were discussed in the literature , among them possible applications to the elementary particles theory @xcite and to the quark confinement problem in the qcd @xcite .",
    "many authors discussed thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas obeying the gentile or parafermi statistics @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will study the thermodynamic limit of one - dimensional relativistic integrable field models governed by a gentile - like statistics .",
    "more precisely , the main purpose of this manuscript is to implement systematically a generalized extensive exclusion statistics into the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) analysis of systems where the interaction of particles is relativistic , short - range and characterized by a factorizable scattering matrix .",
    "the tba was originally developed in the seminal papers by yang and yang @xcite for treating a one - dimensional ideal gas . in",
    "later works @xcite this technique was adopted to one - dimensional relativistic models .",
    "the boundary condition for a many - particle wave function leads to what is commonly referred to as the bethe ansatz equation , that provides the quantization condition for possible momenta of the system .",
    "the tba constitutes an interface between massive integrable models and conformal field theories . from the tba",
    "one can extract information about the ultraviolet limit of the underlying massive model , in particular , find the corresponding ( effective ) central charge .    in the derivation of the tba equation the underlying exclusion statistics is usually taken to be either of bosonic or fermionic type @xcite . in the present paper the tba equation will be derived and studied for significantly more general situation .",
    "namely , let @xmath4 denote the total dimension of the hilbert space for a system of @xmath5 indistinguishable particles that can occupy @xmath6 different states in the fock - space .",
    "assume that there exists a function such that its @xmath6-th power is a generating function for the dimensions @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath7 in the statistical mechanics , if the variable @xmath8 is understood as fugacity , the sum on the right hand side is the grand partition function of the system .",
    "the property of a grand partition function to be an @xmath6-th power of a function independent of @xmath6 is called _ extensivity_. as we are going to demonstrate below , this property allows us to develop the tba analysis for a rather general choice of @xmath9 .",
    "let us stress that for the purpose of deriving the tba equation even asymptotical extensivity suffices , i.e. , equation ( [ fgen ] ) should hold in the large @xmath6 limit .    of course ,",
    "if the explicit form of @xmath9 is known , we can use it to simplify the general formulae .",
    "for instance , an instructive example is the gentile statistics of order @xmath1 which is defined by the following choice of @xmath9 : @xmath10 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 this statistics describes ordinary fermions and bosons , respectively .",
    "although @xmath11 is the simplest non - trivial choice of @xmath9 , it has all features of a generalized extensive statistics",
    ". therefore , the gentile statistics will be our main working example below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe possible types of a generalized extensive statistics and study properties of the corresponding entropy densities in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the gentile statistics and the @xmath0-ons statistics are discussed in this context . in section 3",
    "we compare properties of the gentile statistics and the haldane - wu statistics . in section 4",
    "we derive the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equation and the finite - size scaling function for a relativistic multi - particle system in which statistical interaction is governed by a generalized extensive statistics . in section 5",
    "we derive the y - system related to such a generalized statistics . in section 6",
    "we study the ultraviolet limit of the generalized tba equation and obtain an expression for the corresponding effective central charge . in section 7",
    "we compute finite - size scaling functions and central charges related to some affine toda models for the gentile statistics and the @xmath0-ons statistics and compare them with their counterparts for the haldane - wu statistics .",
    "our conclusions are stated in section 8 .",
    "consider a system of @xmath5 indistinguishable particles that can occupy @xmath6 different states in the fock - space .",
    "assume that the particles obey the gentile statistics of order @xmath1 , i.e. , that each state can be occupied by at most @xmath1 particles ( with @xmath1 being a positive integer number ) .",
    "there are several combinatorial ways to compute the total dimension of the hilbert space for such a system .",
    "for instance , we first choose @xmath12 states which are occupied by at least one particle , then among these @xmath12 states we choose @xmath13 states which are occupied by at least two particles , etc .",
    "this way of counting yields the following expression for the total dimension of the hilbert space @xmath14 where @xmath15 are binomial coefficients ( and @xmath16 if @xmath17 or if @xmath18 ) .",
    "now , let us compute @xmath6-th power of the polynomial @xmath11 defined in ( [ gf ] ) .",
    "thanks to the obvious recursive relation @xmath19 , we can do this by @xmath1 consecutive applications of the binomial formula .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath6-th power of @xmath11 is a generating function for the dimensions @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 thus , the gentile statistics is a particular case of an extensive statistics .",
    "let us stress that the order @xmath1 of the gentile statistics must be a positive integer . although we could try to extend it to other values by formal replacement of ( [ gf ] ) with @xmath22 the resulting function @xmath11 will not satisfy the important positivity property ( see below ) .",
    "consider now a more general system of @xmath5 indistinguishable particles that possesses , at least for large @xmath6 , the extensivity property ( [ fgen ] ) with @xmath23 where @xmath24 can be a finite positive number or infinity .",
    "the taylor coefficients @xmath25 are fractional dimensions of levels in a single - state hilbert subspace and can be regarded as probabilities of occupation of the given state by @xmath26 particles ( see related discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "the total dimension of the single - state subspace is @xmath27 .",
    "it is natural to require _ positivity _ of the quantities",
    "@xmath25 : @xmath28 the first condition here implies that the vacuum is realized with probability one independently of the size @xmath6 of the system .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the series ( [ f ] ) converges in the complex plane for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that @xmath9 belongs to one of the following types : @xmath31 the types i , ii , and iii consist of finite degree polynomials , analytic functions with infinite taylor series , and meromorphic functions , respectively .",
    "for example , a finite order gentile statistics belongs to the type i , the boltzmann statistics ( @xmath32 ) belongs to the type ii , and the bosonic statistics ( @xmath33 ) is of the type iiib .",
    "the reason we divided the type iii into two subtypes will become clear below .",
    "let us remark that , in addition to ( [ posit ] ) , one may require that @xmath34 with the motivation that the statistics should not be deformed if only one particle is present in the system . although all the concrete cases which we consider below do fulfill this requirement , it does not seem to be crucial for the general considerations .",
    "the entropy of the system under consideration is @xmath35 , where @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we need to compute the entropy in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , when @xmath36 and @xmath37 is fixed .",
    "the extensivity property ( [ fgen ] ) allows us to express @xmath4 as the following contour integral @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and we denoted @xmath40 .",
    "now we can find an asymptotic expression for the entropy in the thermodynamic limit by application of the saddle point method to the integral ( [ cint ] ) .",
    "the saddle point of the exponent in ( [ cint ] ) , denote it @xmath41 , is found as the positive root of the equation ( prime stands for a derivative ) @xmath42 choosing @xmath43 in ( [ cint ] ) , so that the saddle point belongs to the integration contour , we apply the standard result ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for the laplace integral : @xmath44 where @xmath45 . for any @xmath9 satisfying ( [ posit ] ) and @xmath41 obeying ( [ xeq ] ) we have @xmath46 due to the hadamard theorem @xcite . from ( [ expr ] )",
    "we obtain the entropy density @xmath47 for a given value of @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath41 is positive and satisfies ( [ xeq ] ) .",
    "two remarks are in order here . strictly speaking , if @xmath9 is degenerated , i.e. , if there exists integer @xmath50 such that @xmath51 , then the above derivation modifies since @xmath9 has @xmath52 saddle points . however , the corresponding physical interpretation is simply that particles can be added only in @xmath52-tuples .",
    "therefore , it is natural to introduce cluster variables @xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc . in terms of these new variables formulae ( [ cint])-([expr ] )",
    "remain valid .",
    "more important remark is that for deriving ( [ lim ] ) the property @xmath55 is crucial . in general , without the positivity property ( [ cint ] ) does not have a real and uniform in @xmath48 limit .",
    "moreover , if we allow @xmath9 to have negative taylor coefficients , then some @xmath4 in the expansion of @xmath56 may also be negative .",
    "this leads to an immediate problem with the definition of the entropy as a logarithm of @xmath4 .",
    "however , if the first negative coefficient in the expansion of @xmath56 appears only at sufficiently large power @xmath57 ( of order @xmath58 ) , then @xmath9 violating the positivity condition can still have well defined entropy density for certain range of @xmath48 .",
    "for instance , such is the case of the haldane - wu statistics with statistical interaction @xmath59 ( see section 3 ) , where @xmath60 .",
    "however , in the present paper we will restrict our consideration , for simplicity , only to partition function strictly obeying the positivity condition .",
    "the entropy density is a key quantity for developing the tba analysis .",
    "from the definition of @xmath48 it is clear that @xmath61 for @xmath9 of the type i and @xmath62 for the other types .",
    "formally this follows from equation ( [ xeq ] ) which shows that @xmath48 varies from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , @xmath65 is a strictly increasing function because @xmath66 for @xmath67 .    since @xmath9 is regular at zero , it is easy to see that @xmath68 tends to zero for small @xmath48 . together with the condition @xmath69 this yields @xmath70 . in order to analyze further behaviour of @xmath47",
    ", we employ ( [ xeq ] ) and derive from ( [ lim ] ) that @xmath71 since @xmath72 , we conclude that @xmath73 , that is @xmath47 is a convex up function .",
    "furthermore , ( [ der ] ) implies that @xmath74 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath47 is not guaranteed to be positive for the whole range of @xmath48 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath47 may have one root at the interval @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath9 of the type i we derive from ( [ xeq ] ) and ( [ lim ] ) that @xmath76 that is , @xmath47 is non - negative everywhere at @xmath61 only if the last taylor coefficient @xmath77 is greater or equal to one . for the other types of @xmath9 we have the following properties @xmath78 indeed , in the first case @xmath79 , hence , according to ( [ der ] )",
    ", @xmath47 is strictly increasing . in the second case",
    "we have @xmath80 .",
    "the integral here apparently diverges since it exceeds @xmath81 , where we can choose any @xmath82 such that @xmath83 .",
    "investigation of thermodynamic properties of models in which the entropy density becomes negative is rather problematic .",
    "therefore eqs .",
    "( [ sd])-([sinf2 ] ) suggest that we should restrict the choice of @xmath9 to the type i with @xmath84 ( the gentile - like statistics ) and to the type iiib ( the bose - like statistics ) . however , let us notice that in the tba framework the variable @xmath41 depends on the rapidity @xmath85 .",
    "for some relativistic models with factorizable scattering the typical picture @xcite is that @xmath86 falls off as @xmath87 grows ( for instance , @xmath88 for the trivial s - matrix ) . in this case",
    "@xmath89 and we can consider @xmath9 of the types ii and iiia if @xmath47 remains non - negative for @xmath90 .    in the context of this discussion",
    "it is instructive to consider the so - called @xmath0-ons @xcite .",
    "these are particles with statistics interpolating between fermions ( @xmath91 ) and bosons ( @xmath92 ) in the following simple way @xmath93 solving equation ( [ xeq ] ) for this choice of @xmath48 it is easy to find the corresponding single - state partition function : @xmath94_\\gamma \\frac{t^k}{k ! } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath95_\\gamma \\= \\prod_{m=1}^{k } ( 1 \\- m\\gamma)$ ] . for @xmath96 the positivity condition ( [ posit ] )",
    "is fulfilled only if @xmath97 , with @xmath24 positive integer . in this case",
    "@xmath98 is of the type i , the corresponding maximal occupancy is @xmath99 . since @xmath100 for @xmath101 , the entropy density becomes negative for certain range of @xmath48 .",
    "the case of @xmath102 describes the boltzmann statistics . here",
    "@xmath103 belongs to the type ii and @xmath47 is negative for @xmath104 .",
    "finally , for @xmath105 the positivity condition ( [ posit ] ) is always fulfilled and @xmath98 is of the type iiia or iiib depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "returning to the gentile statistics , we can summarize the properties of the corresponding entropy density @xmath106 as follows ( see fig .  1 for illustration ) .",
    "@xmath106 is a convex up function defined for @xmath107 and vanishing at the end points of this interval .",
    "it attains the maximum at @xmath108 : @xmath109 furthermore , @xmath106 possesses the following symmetry @xmath110 this is a consequence of the equality @xmath111 which , in turn , follows from the relation ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare thermodynamic properties of a system of particles obeying the gentile statistics with those of a system obeying the so - called haldane - wu statistics . for the latter ,",
    "the total dimension of the hilbert space is postulated to be @xcite @xmath112 this expression interpolates between the bosonic ( @xmath113 ) and the fermionic ( @xmath114 ) statistics .",
    "introduction of such an interpolating statistics was motivated by haldane s generalization @xcite of the pauli exclusion principle to the form @xmath115 here @xmath116 is the number of available states ( holes ) before the @xmath5-th particle has been added to the system .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is called the statistical interaction .",
    "properties of an ideal gas obeying the haldane - wu statistics were actively discussed in the literature @xcite . the corresponding tba equation for relativistic integrable models was obtained in @xcite and investigated in @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison of the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath117 is problematic if the system contains a finite number of particles . indeed ,",
    "formula ( [ gcount ] ) has a bulky form for generic @xmath1 ( i.e. , for @xmath118 ) .",
    "moreover , it requires additional conventions to make exact sense of expression ( [ wahr ] ) for generic @xmath59 ( i.e. , for @xmath119 ) .",
    "actually , there exists no prescription for counting of states on the microscopical level that would lead to ( [ wahr ] ) ( see related discussions in @xcite ) . to overcome these difficulties we can compare the two statistics in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more precisely , let us compare the entropy density @xmath106 with its counterpart @xmath120 that is readily derived from ( [ wahr ] ) with the help of the stirling formula @xmath121    let us notice that the haldane - wu statistics is extensive but the corresponding function @xmath122 does not satisfy the positivity property ( [ posit ] ) .",
    "indeed , we can reconstruct @xmath122 first as a function of @xmath48 by the following formula @xmath123 that follows from ( [ lim ] ) and ( [ der ] ) . for @xmath124 given by ( [ limhw ] )",
    "this yields @xmath125 which is a well - defined function . but",
    "reexpressing it in terms of @xmath8 with the help of ( [ xeq ] ) we will always obtain a function that breaks the positivity property ( [ posit ] ) .",
    "for instance , for @xmath126 we find ( which coincides with the result of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the first negative term in expansion of the @xmath6-th power of this series appears for @xmath127 .",
    "this implies that in the large @xmath6 limit thermodynamic quantities are well - defined for @xmath128 .    for our purposes we can regard ( [ limhw ] ) as _ a definition _ of the haldane - wu statistics .",
    "then we have a finite maximal occupancy @xmath129 for a given number of particles @xmath6 simply because @xmath124 is defined for @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath124 is a convex up function vanishing at the end points of this interval .",
    "thus , we see that properties of the entropy density @xmath124 are similar to those of a type i extensive statistics and , specifically , to those of the gentile statistics .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask how much the behaviour of @xmath106 differs from @xmath124 if @xmath131 ( when the corresponding maximal occupancies coincide ) .    first ,",
    "notice that the function @xmath132 can not coincide with @xmath106 identically for generic @xmath1 since @xmath124 does not possess a symmetry like ( [ sym ] ) if @xmath133 .",
    "next , we can compare the mid - point value @xmath134 with the corresponding value of @xmath106 given by ( [ gmax ] ) .",
    "taking into account the inequalities @xmath135   t \\ln t < ( t-1)\\ln(t+1 ) \\qquad { \\rm for } \\quad 0<t<1 \\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] we establish that @xmath136 for @xmath137 .",
    "actually , numerical computations for various values of @xmath137 show that @xmath106 majorizes @xmath132 _ everywhere _ at @xmath138 , @xmath139 for illustration , the case of @xmath140 is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "thus , we see that for generic @xmath1 the difference between @xmath132 and @xmath106 is not small if @xmath48 is not close to @xmath141 or @xmath142 .",
    "it is instructive to compare these functions also near the end points ( in particular , this will provide an additional support to the assertion ( [ ineq2 ] ) ) .    in a vicinity of @xmath141 equation ( [ xeq ] ) is solved as @xmath143 , and we find that @xmath144 , where @xmath145 stands for the kronecker symbol . comparing this expansion with @xmath146 which follows from ( [ limhw ] )",
    ", we infer that for small @xmath48 functions @xmath124 and @xmath106 take close values ( up to the order @xmath147 ) for _ any choice _ of @xmath1 and @xmath59 . actually , employing ( [ xeq ] ) , it is easy to derive the following expansion for the entropy density of an arbitrary extensive statistics with @xmath9 satisfying ( [ posit ] ) : @xmath148 thus , for small @xmath48 in the thermodynamic limit , the haldane - wu and gentile statistics are close not only to each other but to any extensive statistics for which two first taylor coefficients of @xmath9 are @xmath149 .",
    "for instance , for small @xmath48 the haldane - wu and gentile statistics are close also to the statistics of @xmath0-ons ( [ fga ] ) .",
    "consider now @xmath150 for small positive @xmath151 .",
    "then , employing ( [ exp ] ) and the symmetry ( [ sym ] ) , we derive : @xmath152 . on the other hand , setting @xmath153 in ( [ limhw ] ) , we obtain @xmath154 .",
    "we see that in a vicinity of @xmath142 the difference between @xmath106 and @xmath132 is not even of first order in @xmath151 but of order @xmath155 ( so that the corresponding plots are visibly different here , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "summarizing , it appears plausible that the gentile statistics of order @xmath156 _ majorizes _ the haldane - wu statistics with parameter @xmath131 and these statistics are _ not close _ except for small values of @xmath157 .",
    "now we will consider a relativistic multi - particle system of @xmath158 different species of particles confined to a finite region of the size @xmath159 .",

    "it is convenient to introduce densities @xmath166 as usual , the rapidity @xmath167 parameterizes the two - momentum @xmath168 and the total energy of the system is given by @xmath169 = l   \\sum_{a=1}^l   \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty }   { \\rm d}\\theta \\ ,   \\rho_a^r ( \\theta ) \\ , m_a \\cosh \\theta \\,.\\ ] ] according to ( [ dens ] ) the variable @xmath48 in ( [ lim ] ) is now related to the particle densities @xmath170 thus , we can express the entropy as the following functional @xmath171 =    kl \\sum_{a=1}^l      \\int_{-\\infty } ^{\\infty }   { \\rm d}\\theta \\ ,         \\rho_a(\\theta )   s(\\mu_a )    = kl \\sum_{a=1}^l \\int_{-\\infty } ^{\\infty } { \\rm d}\\theta \\ ,    \\bigl\\ { \\rho_a(\\theta ) \\ln f_a(x_a(\\theta ) ) -     \\rho_a^r(\\theta ) \\ln x_a(\\theta ) \\bigr\\ } \\,,\\ ] ] where each @xmath172 satisfies ( [ xeq ] ) and hence it is a function of @xmath173 .",
    "the subscript of @xmath174 means that different species may have different single - state partition functions .    in the formulation of the tba equation for ordinary statistics",
    "it is common to introduce the so - called pseudo - energies @xmath175 such that bosonic ( upper sign ) and fermionic ( lower sign ) distributions are @xmath176 . in view of ( [ xeq ] ) , it is natural to define the pseudo - energies for an arbitrary extensive statistics as follows @xmath177 so that @xmath178 .",

    "hence , keeping the temperature constant we obtain the equilibrium condition by minimizing @xmath181 = e\\left [ \\rho^r \\,\\right ] -ts\\left [ \\rho , \\rho^r \\,\\right ] $ ] with respect to @xmath182",

    "the desired thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations for a system in which statistical interaction between particles of @xmath162-th species is described by a single - state partition function @xmath174 , @xmath192    in general , this set of integral equations can not be solved analytically .",
    "however , one can try to solve these tba equations numerically with the help of the iteration method ( as we will do for some examples in section 7 ) . for the ordinary statistics and the haldane - wu case it is known that such an iterative procedure converges provided that @xmath193 falls off sufficiently fast .",
    "the most complete proof of this assertion is presented in @xcite and is based on the fixed point theorem .",
    "presumably this proof extends to the case of ( [ gtba ] ) ( although some further restrictions on @xmath194 may be required ) , but we will not discuss this here . let us notice only that if ( [ gtba ] ) can be solved iteratively and @xmath195 is symmetric in @xmath85 ( which is always the case for a unitary s - matrix ) , then @xmath172 is also symmetric in @xmath85 .",
    "we now substitute the expressions for the total energy ( [ ener ] ) and the entropy ( [ entro ] ) together with equations ( [ bou ] ) and ( [ gtba ] ) back into the expression for the free energy , and obtain @xmath196 the relation between the free energy and the finite - size scaling function is well - known to be @xmath197 @xcite .",

    "commonly referred to as ) have the further virtue that unlike the original tba equations they _ do not _ involve the mass spectrum . in the @xmath208-variables certain periodicities in the rapidities are exhibited more clearly .",
    "these periodicities may then be utilized in order to express the quantity @xmath209 as a fourier series , which in turn is useful to find solution of the tba equations and expand the scaling function as a power series in the scaling parameter @xmath210 .",
    "we will now demonstrate that similar equations may be derived for a multi - particle system in which the dynamical scattering is governed by the scattering matrix related to the ade - affine toda field theories and the statistical interaction is of a general type considered above .",
    "consider the minimal part ( i.e. , independent of the coupling constant ) of the scattering matrix of the ade - affine toda field theories . as was shown in @xcite , upon appropriate choice of cdd - ambiguities ,",
    "these s - matrices satisfy the identity @xmath211 where @xmath212 denotes the coxeter number , @xmath158 the rank and @xmath213 the incidence matrix of the corresponding lie algebra .",
    "it is then straightforward to derive the `` y - system '' @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 equations ( [ ys ] ) follow upon first adding ( [ gtba ] ) at @xmath217 and @xmath218 and subtracting @xmath213 times ( [ gtba ] ) at @xmath167 from the sum .",
    "thereafter we employ the fact @xcite that the masses of an ade affine toda field theory are proportional to the perron - frobenius vector of the corresponding cartan matrix , i.e. , @xmath219 .",
    "then , with the help of ( [ rad ] ) , equations ( [ ys ] ) follow .    in comparison with ( [ gtba ] ) equations ( [ ys ] ) have already the virtue that they are simple functional equations and do not involve the mass spectrum . for the gentile statistics we have @xmath220 . in particular , for @xmath221 we have @xmath222 and recover the known fermionic y - system .",
    "the bosonic case ( @xmath3 ) corresponds to @xmath223 . and the case of @xmath224 seems to be particularly interesting since here @xmath225 possesses an additional symmetry @xmath226 or , equivalently , @xmath227 .",
    "in the small @xmath210 limit the scaling function @xmath228 becomes the effective central charge of a conformal field theory @xcite which describes the ultraviolet limit of a given massive model .",
    "that is , @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the conformal anomaly and @xmath231 is the lowest conformal weight in the corresponding conformal field theory .    in order to evaluate @xmath228 in the @xmath232 limit",
    "we substitute the derivative of ( [ gtba ] ) into ( [ c(r ) ] ) , replacing in both equations @xmath233 by @xmath234",
    ". then we integrate the resulting equation by parts , assuming that @xmath195 is symmetric and falls off sufficiently fast ( typically , @xmath235 as @xmath236 ) .",
    "next we substitute back equation ( [ gtba ] ) .",
    "finally we change variables from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , taking into account that @xmath237 ( as follows from ( [ gtba ] ) ) , and again integrate by parts .",
    "all this yields @xmath238 @xmath239 here we denoted @xmath240 .",
    "these quantities can be determined from the _ constant _ tba equations that follow from ( [ gtba ] ) when @xmath241 ( this derivation requires that @xmath172 become constant in a region of @xmath85 of order @xmath242 when @xmath210 is small ; see more detailed explanations in @xcite ) @xmath243 where @xmath244 .    as a simple example we consider the statistics of @xmath0-ons ( [ fga ] ) , assuming for simplicity that @xmath0 is the same for all species ( generalization to different @xmath245 is obvious ) .",
    "here the integral in ( [ c2 ] ) can be computed explicitly in terms of the euler dilogarithm which is defined for @xmath246 as @xmath247 .",
    "we have @xmath248 and hence @xmath249 where @xmath250 satisfies ( [ ctba ] ) .",
    "since @xmath251 , we can rewrite ( [ cga1 ] ) for positive @xmath0 employing the rogers dilogarithm which is defined as @xmath252 for @xmath253 .",
    "then , using the abel identity @xmath254 , we obtain @xmath255 notice that this expression does not diverge for small @xmath0 ; @xmath256 is the value corresponding to the boltzmann statistics .",
    "consider now the gentile statistics , assuming that the order @xmath1 is the same for all species . in this case",
    "we also can compute the integral in ( [ c2 ] ) explicitly : @xmath257 and we see that for the gentile statistics expression ( [ c2 ] ) acquires the following nice form involving only the rogers dilogarithms : @xmath258 introducing , in agreement with ( [ id1 ] ) , the constants @xmath259 , we obtain from ( [ cg ] ) for @xmath260 and @xmath221 @xmath261 these are the well - known values for the bosonic and fermionic statistics @xcite . notice that in the latter case one usually derives @xmath262 .",
    "this is equivalent to our formula ( [ cbcf ] ) due to the abel identity .",
    "in fact , the abel identity can be used in a similar way for any @xmath1 of the form @xmath263 . in this case",
    "we can rewrite ( [ cg ] ) as follows @xmath264 in this form @xmath265 is a manifestly positive and monotonic function of @xmath250 ( the dilogarithm @xmath266 grows monotonically for @xmath253 ) .",
    "actually , this property holds not only for the gentile statistics but in general case as well . to prove this statement we take a derivative of ( [ c2 ] ) and use ( [ xeq ] ) and the formula ( [ lim ] ) for the entropy density .",
    "this yields @xmath267 as we discussed in section 2 , we should consider only such models where @xmath268 . in this case the r.h.s",
    ".  of ( [ dc ] ) is positive .",
    "hence , @xmath265 is always a monotonically increasing function of @xmath250 ( and therefore a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath269 ) .",
    "moreover , taking into account ( [ posit ] ) , we infer from ( [ c2 ] ) that @xmath270 , thus we also proved positivity of @xmath271 .",
    "since these properties are crucial for a physical interpretation of @xmath265 , let us underline that they hold only if the first condition in ( [ posit ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "let us notice also that the properties of @xmath265 together with ( [ ctba ] ) imply that for any model such that @xmath272 ( which is the case , for instance , for all the ade - affine toda models @xcite ) the value of @xmath265 does not exceed that of the corresponding free model ( where all @xmath273 and consequently all @xmath274 ) .",
    "hence , ( [ c2 ] ) evaluated for @xmath274 yields the upper bound on @xmath265 , @xmath275 notice , however , that for a statistics of the type iiib with @xmath276 we have @xmath277 , so that in this case the upper bound on @xmath265 will be lower than ( [ cmax ] ) . from a physical point of view",
    "this implies that such a statistics can not emerge in models with weak interaction and , in particular , in a free model .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the quantity @xmath278 ( for the ordinary statistics ) can be interpreted as a massless degree of freedom associated to the @xmath162-th species in the massive model .",
    "the properties of @xmath265 which we proved above show that the interpretation of @xmath278 can be extended to the case of a generalized extensive statistics as well . in this context , it is important to remark that for the ordinary statistics ( actually , for the gentile statistics of any order ) we have @xmath279 as follows from ( [ cg ] ) ( recall that @xmath280 ) if all @xmath281 are non - negative . however , for a general statistics the upper bound ( [ cmax ] ) on @xmath278 depends on the choice of @xmath174 and may not equal to one .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath282 with @xmath283 , we obtain @xmath284 for the corresponding free theory .",
    "in such a case , the massless degree of freedom of the corresponding free particle exceeds that of a free boson .",
    "this can possibly imply that we have to restrict the choice of statistics to such @xmath174 that @xmath285 .",
    "the most simple examples which illustrate the features outlined above more concretely are the ising model ( @xmath286-minimal affine toda field theory ) with @xmath287 and the klein - gordon model with @xmath288 in both cases equation ( [ gtba ] ) is solved trivially , @xmath289 .",
    "then for the gentile statistics ( [ gf ] ) we can compute the entire scaling function ( [ c(r ) ] ) : @xmath290 where @xmath291 is the modified bessel function .",
    "we depict @xmath292 in fig .  2 , referring to them by a slight abuse of notation as @xmath293 .",
    "one observes that the difference in statistics affects most severely the ultraviolet region .",
    "the scaling functions for different @xmath1 converge relatively fast towards each other in the infrared regime .",
    "these appear to be common features of a general deformed statistics .    as seen from fig .  2 ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath292 in the ultraviolet region ( there is no first order term in the small @xmath210 expansion of @xmath292 ) is similar for any finite @xmath1 to that of the fermionic scaling function and is different from the bosonic case ( where the first order term is present ) . to explain this we observe that , as follows from ( [ cf ] ) , @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the bosonic scaling function .",
    "now it is obvious that the first order terms on the r.h.s .  of ( [ cb ] )",
    "cancel each other for any finite @xmath1 .",
    "the well - known property of the asymptotic behaviour of the modified bessel function , @xmath296 , allows us to derive from ( [ cf ] ) @xmath297 which is in agreement with ( [ cg ] ) since @xmath298 now .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath299 can be identified for every positive integer @xmath1 as the effective central charge of a minimal conformal model @xmath300 ( such that @xmath301 ) . in particular , @xmath302 correspond to the @xmath303 , @xmath304 , @xmath305 , @xmath306 minimal models , respectively .    for the @xmath0-ons ( [ fga ] ) the scaling function related to the @xmath293-models",
    "can also be computed : @xmath307 using again the asymptotic behaviour of the modified bessel function , we obtain @xmath308 in agreement with ( [ cga1 ] ) . here , unlike in the gentile case , it is not easy to see whether the effective central charge @xmath309 has rational value for a given @xmath0 . as we discussed in section 2 , positive @xmath0 is to be of the form @xmath310 with @xmath24 positive integer .",
    "it appears then that the only @xmath24 leading to rational value of @xmath309 is @xmath311 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 varies continuously in the range @xmath312 , so that any rational value of @xmath309 not exceeding @xmath313 occurs here . for the boltzmann statistics @xmath314",
    "is irrational .",
    "finally , @xmath315 is the case of a type iiib statistics with @xmath276 , which , as we discussed above , can not emerge in a free model .",
    "next we consider the scaling potts model , which was studied previously in the tba framework for the fermionic statistics in @xcite and for the haldane - wu statistics in @xcite .",
    "the two particles in the model are conjugate to each other and consequently their masses are the same , @xmath316 .",
    "the conjugate particle occurs as a bound state when two particles of the same species scatter .",
    "the s - matrix of the scaling potts model equals the minimal s - matrix of the @xmath317-affine toda field theory .",
    "the corresponding quantities @xmath195 that enter the tba equation are given by @xmath318    consider the scaling potts model with both species of particles obeying the gentile statistics of the same order @xmath1 . in this case the @xmath319-symmetry of the model is preserved so that @xmath320 and ( [ gtba ] ) reduces to a single integral equation .",

    "the results for @xmath2 ( which is in complete agreement with the calculation in @xcite ) and for @xmath224 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . to make contact with the literature",
    ", we introduced the quantity @xmath324 .",
    "one observes the typical plateau @xmath325 for some region of @xmath85 when @xmath326 , which is required to derive ( [ ctba ] ) .",
    "we see also that for the same value of @xmath323 the functions @xmath327 corresponding to different @xmath1 have similar profiles but different heights of the plateau .",
    "having solved the generalized tba equation , we can substitute @xmath86 into ( [ c(r ) ] ) and compute the entire scaling function @xmath328 .",
    "the result of the numerical computation is shown in fig .",
    "the behaviour of the scaling functions is similar to what we have already observed in the @xmath293 case .    due to the fact that the scattering matrices of the scaling potts model and the scaling yang - lee model are related as @xmath329 , the generalized tba equations for the two models coincide .",
    "the only difference is that the scaling yang - lee model has only one particle .",
    "therefore its scaling function equals a half of that for the scaling potts model .",
    "in section 3 we have seen that the entropy density corresponding to the gentile statistics majorizes that for the haldane - wu statistics .",
    "it appears ( at least for certain models ) that an analogous relation holds for the corresponding finite - size scaling functions .",
    "specifically , if @xmath292 is the scaling function ( [ c(r ) ] ) of @xmath293 or @xmath330 minimal affine toda model where all species obey order @xmath1 gentile statistics and @xmath331 is the scaling function ( [ hwcr ] ) of the same model where the haldane - wu statistical interaction is of the form @xmath332 , then for all @xmath333 we have @xmath334 for the @xmath293 case we can rigorously prove relation ( [ crin ] ) since the solutions of the generalized tba equations ( [ gtba ] ) and ( [ hwtba ] ) are found explicitly : @xmath335 this equation allows us to express @xmath86 in terms of @xmath336 : @xmath337 moreover , since @xmath338 , we infer from ( [ xy0 ] ) that @xmath339 as seen from ( [ c(r ) ] ) and ( [ hwcr ] ) , in order to establish ( [ crin ] ) it suffices to show that @xmath340 .",
    "the latter relation is equivalent to the inequality @xmath341 as can be verified by simple algebraic manipulations using formula ( [ xy1 ] ) .",
    "now it is elementary to check that ( [ yy ] ) is valid provided that ( [ yy0 ] ) holds .",
    "thus , we proved the assertion ( [ crin ] ) in the @xmath293 case . for illustration ,",
    "the scaling function @xmath331 for @xmath342 haldane - wu statistics is shown in fig .",
    "2 . it lies everywhere below @xmath292 for @xmath224 gentile statistics with the maximal difference reached in the ultraviolet region .    for a higher rank case , already for @xmath330 ,",
    "the generalized tba equations are integral and it is not clear whether we can compare @xmath172 and @xmath343 analytically .",
    "however , numerical computations for various @xmath1 show that ( [ crin ] ) holds in the @xmath330 case as well . for illustration , we present in fig .",
    "4 the scaling function @xmath331 for the haldane - wu statistics with @xmath344 .",
    "a particular consequence of ( [ crin ] ) is the following inequality for the corresponding central charges : @xmath345 here @xmath299 is found from ( [ c0 ] ) , ( [ ctba ] ) and ( [ cg ] ) whereas @xmath346 is the effective central charge related to the haldane - wu statistics with @xmath332 and is given by @xcite @xmath347 again , in the @xmath293 case we can prove relation ( [ cin ] ) directly . here",

    "therefore , @xmath352 .",
    "using now a property of the dilogarithm , @xmath353 we establish the desired inequality ( [ din1 ] ) .",
    "as we discussed above , the order @xmath1 of the gentile statistics is to be a positive integer .",
    "however , if we regard ( [ c0 ] ) , ( [ ctba ] ) and ( [ cg ] ) as a _ definition _ of the quantity @xmath299 , then ( [ din1 ] ) extends to any @xmath354 ( since the proof does not require that @xmath1 be an integer ) as shown in fig .",
    "5 . furthermore ,",
    "considering @xmath1 in the range @xmath355 , we can prove with the help of ( [ gin ] ) that here @xmath356 and hence @xmath357 due to ( [ lin ] ) .",
    "thus , for this range of @xmath1 we have a _",
    "reverse _ inequality , i.e. , @xmath358 as we will see below , this inequality holds for higher rank cases as well . but let us stress again that @xmath299 in ( [ cin2 ] ) is a formally defined quantity which is not related directly to the gentile statistics .    the inequality for the central charges ( [ cin ] ) is a weaker statement than the inequality for the scaling functions ( [ crin ] ) .",
    "( [ cin ] ) involves dilogarithms , which makes its proof more complicated ( already in the @xmath293 case we used a rather subtle property ( [ lin ] ) ) .",
    "but the advantage of ( [ cin ] ) for a numerical verification is that it relates numbers and not functions as ( [ crin ] ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath228 is a continuous function , validity of ( [ cin ] ) implies that ( [ crin ] ) holds at least in some ultraviolet region .",
    "therefore , we will discuss below validity of ( [ cin ] ) for several affine toda models . as a mathematical by - product",
    ", this provides us with interesting dilogarithm inequalities .    in the @xmath330 case , eq .",
    "( [ cin ] ) contains dilogarithms in a more involved way . as seen from ( [ ctba ] ) , ( [ cg ] ) and ( [ chw1 ] ) , it is equivalent to the following inequality @xmath359 here @xmath360 and @xmath361",
    "are determined from the following equations that follow from ( [ ctba ] ) and ( [ chw1 ] ) upon noticing that @xmath362 @xmath363 it is worth remarking that , as was noticed in @xcite , @xmath364 coincides with the effective central charge of the calogero - sutherland model with the coupling constant @xmath365 .",
    "numerical computations show that ( [ din2 ] ) indeed holds for any @xmath119 , that is for any @xmath366 ( here again we need not to restrict @xmath1 to be an integer ) .",
    "furthermore , like in the @xmath293 case , inequality ( [ din2 ] ) reverses for @xmath355 , i.e. , for @xmath367 . for illustration ,",
    "we depict the corresponding @xmath299 and @xmath346 in fig .  5 .",
    "this result provides an additional support to our claim that in the @xmath330 case the entire scaling function @xmath292 majorizes @xmath331 for @xmath137 .    it is interesting to remark",
    "that , as follows from ( [ cg ] ) and ( [ chw1 ] ) , the bosonic version ( @xmath3 or , equivalently , @xmath368 ) of the @xmath330-minimal affine toda model has @xmath369 .",
    "that is , then each species in the scaling potts model ( or the only species in the scaling yang - lee model ) appears to be a free fermion , whereas the entire central charge is that of a free boson ( see also related comments in @xcite ) .",
    "that is why all curves on fig .",
    "5 converge to the same value @xmath370 .",
    "now we discuss briefly the simplest minimal affine toda models which have particle species with different masses .",
    "we will compare numerical values of @xmath299 and @xmath371 again setting @xmath372 .",
    "for this purpose we use ( [ ctba ] ) and ( [ chw1 ] ) , taking into account @xcite that the @xmath6-matrix in these equations is given by @xmath373 , where @xmath374 stands for the incidence matrix of the corresponding lie algebra * g*.    in the @xmath375 case the masses of the three species are @xmath376 .",
    "then , computing @xmath299 by formulae ( [ ctba ] ) and ( [ cg ] ) , we find : @xmath377 , @xmath378 , @xmath379 , @xmath380 for @xmath381 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath371 corresponding to the haldane - wu statistics with @xmath332 were found in @xcite : @xmath382 , @xmath378 , @xmath383 , @xmath380 for @xmath384 , respectively .",
    "carring out analogous computations for the @xmath385 case , where the masses of the four species are @xmath386 , @xmath387 , we find ( gentile statistics ) : @xmath388 , @xmath389 , @xmath390 , @xmath391 for @xmath381 , respectively ; and ( haldane - wu statistics ) : @xmath392 , @xmath389 , @xmath393 , @xmath391 for @xmath384 , respectively .",
    "one can also consider a folded algebra case with two different masses , namely @xmath394 , where @xmath395 .",
    "in general , one assigns to the @xmath396 minimal affine toda model a tad - pole graph @xcite such that the corresponding incidence matrix differs from that of @xmath397 only by 1 in the lower - right entry .",
    "then one can check that @xmath250 in ( [ ctba ] ) and @xmath398 in ( [ chw1 ] ) coincide with those for the @xmath399 case ( a well - known fact for the fermionic statistics @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , for any statistics we have @xmath400 .",
    "therefore , the data for @xmath394 follow from the above results for @xmath385 .    finally ,",
    "in the @xmath401 case , where the masses of the four species are @xmath402 , we obtain for the gentile statistics : @xmath403 , @xmath378 , @xmath404 , @xmath405 for @xmath381 , respectively ; and for the haldane - wu statistics : @xmath406 , @xmath378 , @xmath407 , @xmath405 for @xmath384 , respectively .",
    "we see that all the above results are in agreement with ( [ cin ] ) and ( [ cin2 ] ) .",
    "this , together with the more detailed results we obtained in the @xmath293 and @xmath330 cases , allows us to conjecture that these inequalities and the inequality ( [ crin ] ) for the scaling functions hold actually for all simply - laced minimal affine toda models .",
    "we remark also that in all the computations of @xmath408 in this subsection we always have the rule that the value of @xmath265 is smaller for the species which has heavier particle ( this was known for the fermionic statistics @xcite ) .",
    "this observation provides an additional support to the above discussed interpretation of @xmath409 as a massless degree of freedom of the corresponding particle .",
    "summarizing , we considered possible types of a generalized extensive statistics and established properties of the corresponding entropy densities . in particular , we established numerically ( and gave some supporting analytical arguments ) that the entropy density for the gentile statistics of order @xmath137 majorizes that for the haldane - wu statistics if they correspond to the same maximal occupancy .",
    "further , we derived the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equation and the finite - size scaling function @xmath228 for a relativistic multi - particle system obeying a generalized extensive exclusion statistics .",
    "we put particular emphasis on the ultraviolet limit of such a system .",
    "we derived an expression for an effective central charge in the general case and showed that for the gentile statistics it acquires an elegant form involving dilogarithms .",
    "we discussed a physical interpretation of the ` partial ' central charges @xmath265 and argued that it possibly leads to restrictions on the choice of statistics .",
    "finally , we observed ( and partially proved ) that the majorizing properties of the gentile statistics with respect to the haldane - wu statistics extend also to finite - size scaling functions and central charges related to the minimal simply - laced affine toda models .    in the presented analysis of thermodynamic properties of a relativistic multi - particle system the single - state partition function @xmath9 played a key role .",
    "for a given model , if we know @xmath9 ( at least in the thermodynamic limit ) and the quantities @xmath195 , then we can compute , at least in principle , the entire scaling function which provides complete thermodynamic description of a system . in principle",
    ", @xmath9 should be determinable from the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "however , this might be a non - trivial task since the exclusion statistics of particles can differ from the exchange statistics of the fields present in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , it may be more practical for a given system to fix an exotic statistics a - priory and investigate whether it leads to realistic physical properties .",
    "in particular , one can obtain information about the ultraviolet limit and see if it corresponds to an appropriate conformal field theory . as we have seen above , the different types ( [ types ] ) of @xmath9 lead to significantly different thermodynamic properties .",
    "the question , which of these statistics can emerge in physical models , remains open .",
    "another open problem is to prove rigorously the assertion ( [ ineq2 ] ) that the entropy density for the gentile statistics majorizes that for the haldane - wu statistics .",
    "such a proof will probably provide a deeper insight into general properties of exotic exclusion statistics .",
    "also it would be interesting to verify the majorizing inequalities for the scaling functions ( [ crin ] ) and central charges ( [ cin ] ) related to the affine toda models and to understand whether such a majorization is a model independent feature of the two involved statistics .",
