    "comet 103p / hartley 2 ( hereafter 103p ) was discovered in march 1986 by m.  @xcite with the uk schmidt telescope at siding spring ( australia ) .",
    "its dynamical history ( * ? ? ? * and following electronic updates ) shows that its orbit has been quite unstable over the last 150 years , with a perihelion distance oscillating between 1 and 2.5  au .",
    "103p is one of the few comets that have become an earth crosser in the recent past .",
    "103p has been frequently observed over the 20 years following its discovery , both by ground - based and space telescopes .",
    "the portrait that emerged from this harvest of ground - based data @xcite is that of a highly active comet , even at large heliocentric distance ( 5  au , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in october 2007 ,",
    "103p was selected as the target for the nasa deep impact extended mission epoxi @xcite ; consequently , an intense world - wide observation campaign has been devoted to characterize its nucleus and coma properties in order to prepare for the spacecraft fly - by , occurring in november 2010 .",
    "the main results of this campaign are summarized in @xcite : the comet has a small , sub - km , nucleus , with a rotation period of 16.4  hrs when inactive , slowly increasing with activity .",
    "this possibly indicates that the rotation rate is slowed by out - gassing from the ( irregular ) surface .",
    "the campaign data also showed that the active fraction of the nucleus surface is , as typical , about 2% , but that it is surrounded by a large halo of ( icy ? ) grains that contribute more than the nucleus to the total water production rate ( @xmath0 90% at perihelion ) .",
    "the presence of large grains was already inferred during the 1998 perihelion passage : analysis and modeling of isocam @xcite infrared images of the dust coma and tail @xcite implied an evolution of the dust production rate from 10  kg  s@xmath1 at 3.25  au to 100  kg  s@xmath1 at 1.04  au , with grains up to centimeters in size .",
    "this dust environment of 103p seems consistent with a _ trail _ structure @xcite , presumably associated with millimeter - sized debris .    on ut",
    "4.583 november 2010 , the nasa mission spacecraft epoxi flew by 103p .",
    "the closest approach was 694  km , when the comet was at 1.064  au from the sun .",
    "the main results of the _ in - situ _ measurements are described in @xcite : the nucleus showed a bi - lobed morphology , with a maximum length of 2.33  km and a mean radius of @xmath2  km .",
    "the rotation period at the time of the closest approach was measured to be @xmath3  h. images obtained during the fly - by confirmed the presence of individual , `` large '' chunks near the nucleus , moving at 12  m  s@xmath1 .",
    "large grains had already been detected via radar observations just before the close encounter @xcite : decimeter - sized grains ( or possibly even larger ) , moving at 2030  m  s@xmath1 , and ejected into free trajectories rather than circum - nuclear orbits were modeled to fit the grain - coma echo from 103p .",
    "@xcite argued that the largest chunks they detected from epoxi were icy , with radii up to 1020  cm , dragged out by super - volatiles ( specifically , co@xmath4 ) and then sublimating to provide a large fraction of the total h@xmath4o gaseous output of the comet .",
    "here we report observations done during 5 ( half ) nights around the time of the space probe fly - by .",
    "the observations were obtained with narrow band filters centered in regions with continuum emission ,  due to the scattering of solar radiation by the grains present in the coma .",
    "all the observations were performed with efosc at the eso 3.56  m new technology telescope ( ntt ) , in la silla ( chile ) .",
    "the observation epoch , geometry and conditions are listed in table  [ tab_log ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     all the images and spectra were at first corrected for bias and flat - field , using the appropriate ancillary frames in the customary manner . to calibrate the images in @xmath5 ( see below )",
    "we computed the `` theoretical '' filter color indexes ( -v and -v ) of the observed spectrophotometric standard and solar analog stars . by using the tabulated spectra , we compared stellar fluxes measured through the nb and v filters to that of a star of a0v spectral type that , by definition , has a color index equal to 0 .",
    "the knowledge of the v magnitude of the observed stars allowed us to recover the nb magnitudes and hence , from the observations , the photometric zero point ( zp ) of each nb filter for each night .    for the extinction correction",
    ", we adopted the standard extinction of la silla . since the standard stars were observed at about the same airmass as at least one of the comet sequences , the errors introduced by possible differences in the extinctions are negligible .",
    "when more than one sequence with the same filter was observed , the resulting calibrated images were in agreement within 10% .",
    "the same agreement was found also for calibrated images from consecutive photometric nights , in regions of the coma where the signature produced by periodic change of activity ( see below ) was not yet present .",
    "all the frames with the same filter were then inter - calibrated ( see below ) .",
    "the level of the sky contribution was then evaluated for each comet sequence , measuring the median level of the sky frame acquired through the same filter @xmath6 away from the comet .",
    "this value was subtracted from each frame .",
    "the sky - subtracted frames then were re - centered on the comet photometric center , and a composite comet image was obtained through a median average of the 5 or 8 frames of the sequence .",
    "the use of a median combination significantly reduces the contamination produced by background stars .",
    "the background was then refined and subtracted with a trial and error procedure using the  function ( see below ) , by making this function independent of the projected nucleo - centric distance ( @xmath7 ) for distances greater than 150 pixels ( corresponding to @xmath8 15000 km at the comet distance ) from the photometric center .",
    "the resulting continuum images were then calibrated in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "as shown by the spacecraft observations @xcite and as already noticed at the telescope during the observations , the comet showed a strong variability with nucleus rotation . by studying the cn features in the coma",
    ", @xcite found that rotation period varied from 17.1  h in september to 18.8  h in november 2010 .",
    "thus for this study we assume a rotation period of 18.8  h. we arbitrarily use as a starting point for the rotation phase the time of the first observation ( not used here because it was recorded with a broad band filter ) .",
    "this point was nov .",
    "1 , ut = 7:39 .",
    "to check how the emission of the continuum varied with the rotation period , we first characterized the constant background coma , which was estimated from the epoch of minimal activity .",
    "@xcite introduced the function  as a proxy for production of the solid component .",
    "@xmath9 is the geometric albedo of the grains and @xmath10 the filling factor , defined as the percentage of the area that is covered by the grains , and @xmath7 the projected nucleo - centric distance of the aperture .",
    "typically , the filling factor , @xmath10 , is proportional to @xmath11 , while @xmath9 is , at first approximation , independent of @xmath7 . since from the observations we get the product @xmath12 ,",
    "it is not possible to disentangle these two parameters without additional observations in the thermal ir or without making assumptions .",
    "here we used another function derived by the above one , ( @xmath7 ) , that is proportional to the average column density of the solid component at the projected nucleo - centric distance @xmath7 .",
    "it is equal to @xmath13 . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "should be constant with respect to the projected nuclear distance , @xmath7 , for a comet with a dust outflow of constant velocity and production rate , and if sublimation or fragmentation of the grains are excluded .",
    "the solar radiation pressure introduces a small linear dependence with @xmath7 , but normally its effects are only noticeable at large distances from the nucleus , larger than the field of view ( fov ) of efosc .    ) functions for all the observations obtained with  ( a ) and  ( b ) filters .",
    "the functions have been vertically shifted by 10  cm for clarity .",

    "the plots are ordered ( from bottom to top ) in observational sequence , as in table  [ tab_log ] , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    the final calibrated images were analyzed by computing their ( @xmath7 ) function . in fig .",
    "[ fig_saf ] some examples of the  function are shown .",
    "the solid component production rate was clearly not constant , as it can be noticed by comparing the regions with @xmath14 500 - 1000 km .",
    "however , excluding the region with @xmath7 smaller than about 30005000  km , the profiles are very similar , and the signatures of the change of activity seems to overlap that of a typical , constant profile .",
    "plotting all the  profiles together , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_saf ] , we can see that they have the same behavior for @xmath7 greater that 3000 - 5000 km and the values of  in that region are within @xmath15 .",
    "these differences are comparable to the uncertainty of the absolute calibration .",
    "we therefore assumed that the average value of  over @xmath7 in the 60008000  km range was constant over the observations , and made small corrections to the zero points to adjust the profiles so they have the same average value over that range .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to considering that any change in grains production did not reach @xmath16  km from one day to the next .",
    "the validity of this hypothesis will be verified later .",
    "note that using this method , the data acquired during the non - photometric night ( nov .  4 ) have been also calibrated to the same system as the others .",
    "all the  profiles are very similar except in the region very close to the nucleus ( @xmath14 2000 km ) where the signature of the activity seems confined . in order to characterize the periodic emissions , a  profile corresponding to the minimum of cometary activity",
    "what we call the `` quiet comet'' was determined for each filter as follows : for the regions with @xmath17 6000 km as a median of all the profiles , and for that with @xmath186000 km as the minimum envelope of all the profiles ( excluding the region with @xmath19 km ) .",
    "the median was used to reduce signatures of possible background stars , still present in the single profiles ; the minimum envelope allowed us to discard the peaks produced by the activity .",
    "however , the always present activity in the regions with @xmath20100 - 200 km ( see below ) was visually removed by spline interpolation .",
    "the   profiles , corresponding to the constant level of activity , are shown in fig .",

    "the errors were obtained from the standard deviation of the values of the  function , with the re - normalization described above .    from the above values of , it is possible to derive the slope of the reflectivity spectrum for the solid component coma of the `` quiet comet '' . assuming a linear variation with lambda , the  at @xmath23=5550    would be 85@xmath223  cm and the corresponding spectral slope would be 5.2@xmath221.5  % /1000   .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_saf_min ] , the  profiles of the minimum activity are not completely constant with @xmath7 , but they systematically increase in the inner region of the coma up to @xmath7 equal to 20002500  km .",
    "note that this behavior can not be due to a residual background , because this would produce a _ linear _ variation with @xmath7 .",
    "a profile like that means that the total grain cross - section increases with @xmath7 in a systematic way .",
    "the only possible explanation is the fragmentation of large grains , with dimensions much larger than the observation wavelength , as they move away from the nucleus . in that way",
    ", the total grain cross - sections would increase with @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to notice that the behavior of the quiet coma can be found in all the profiles , even though , it is partially hidden by the periodic activity      by subtracting the minimum profile for  or  from the individual  profiles , we found the signature of the clouds of grains periodically ejected by the nucleus .",
    "typical  profiles of the those clouds are shown in figure  [ fig_saf_burst ] .",
    "all profiles are similar , with a very strong increase towards the nucleus .",
    "there is no evidence of any motion of the clouds , as it has been seen for other outbursts ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    ".        it would be interesting to determine the colors of the clouds of grains produced by the periodic activity , and to compare them to that of the coma at minimum activity .",
    "this measurement is complicated by the rapid evolution of the cloud and by the fact that the observations in  and  are taken at different times . to measure the color of the material produced by the activity , we have first to characterize its evolution with time .",
    "we determined then the time when the comet was closer to the minimum activity , by checking the individual  profiles and then selecting the minimum ones .",
    "they were those recorded on november 6 at ut 5:10 and 5:58 for the  and  filters , respectively .",
    "their  profiles are very similar to the minimum profiles derived above : only a narrow and faint peak is present in the region with @xmath14 100 - 200 km , indicating that the periodic activity was starting again . by chance",
    "those two observations are very close to the rotation phase equal to 0 as defined in the previous section .    to map the emission produced by the periodic activity",
    ", we subtract these images corresponding to the minimum of activity from the individual images .    as pointed out above , those two images were not acquired at the exact minimum of activity : the inner part already shows the signs of the periodic activity emission .",
    "nevertheless , these signs are limited to the very inner coma ( @xmath24 200 km ) and it is easy to take them into account in the following analysis .",
    "the activity maps are shown as a function of the rotation phase in figures  [ fig_bc_ejecta ] and [ fig_rc_ejecta ] for the  and  filters , respectively .",
    "for clarity , the figures cover a limited fov , equivalent to a projected area of 2000 @xmath25 2000  km@xmath26 centered on the comet .",
    "the fov actually covered by the observations is more than 10 times larger .",
    "the grains released by the periodic activity are clearly visible in both filters .",
    "they are particularly evident in two preferred directions .",
    "the first one points to the east at position angle pa@xmath2790and is active from a rotation phase of about 90  to 200 .",
    "the second one points to pa @xmath27140and is active from the rotation phase greater than 200 .",
    "they do nt seem produced by the same active region on the rotating nucleus , because in such a case we should see the produced grains spiraling around the nucleus .",
    "we have then analyzed the two directions independently , to check whether the active regions have different origins , as found by the spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the maps have been transformed to polar coordinates , and the profiles of the emission with respect to the nucleo - centric distance @xmath7 have been obtained by integrating between pa  =  40  and 117  for the first cloud , and between pa  =  118  to 165  for the second one .",
    "the profiles have been transformed in equivalent  units ( accounting for the limited angular range , as the standard definition of  implies an integration over 2@xmath28 ) .",
    "typical equivalent  profiles of the cloud during a phase of high activity are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_saf_pa080 ] .",
    "the  profiles for the active regions are very similar to those presented earlier for the 1d analysis only the peak intensity and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) are different . excluding the region with @xmath24 200  km , which is dominated by the seeing of the image and contaminated by the near - nucleus activity in the reference image of the `` quiet '' comet , the profiles are very well represented by a constant plus an exponential function , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scale length of the cloud released by the activity ( in km ) , and @xmath31 the peak intensity ( in cm ) .",
    "the fit residuals are very small , with errors less than 10% even for profiles with medium / high activity ,  with high snr .",
    "the variation of @xmath30 with time gives the projected expansion velocity of the grains located at @xmath32 .",
    "of course grains located at @xmath33 have larger projected velocities and those at smaller distances have smaller velocities",
    ". since the direction of the emission of the cloud of particles in space is not known , the projected velocities are a lower limit of the real expansion velocities . to get the projected velocity we used the observations from november  6 , that are most numerous and that were obtained when the level of activity was relatively high .",
    "the resulting @xmath34 is @xmath3520  m  s@xmath1 for both clouds , which is comparable to the velocity of the grains measured by radar @xcite .",
    "note that they measured radial velocities , while we measured projected velocities .",
    "those low projected velocities imply that the cloud of grains produced by periodic activity can not move to distances greater than about 1700 km in 24 hours .",
    "this implies the grains must still be well within the fov for observations recorded during the following night .",
    "the assumption we had made before , that the grains had not reached a projected distance larger than 6000 km from one night to the next , is therefore valid , justifying our inter - normalization of the outer part of the profiles .",
    "the equivalent @xmath36 functions are always peaked at @xmath7 close to 0 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_saf_burst ] .",

    "however , we can not firmly prove this asserting .",
    "in fact , for example , the data at phase around 200  come from observations of nov . 3 at ut 8 - 9 , while the data for phase of 300  come from observations taken the day after , more or less at the same ut ( see tables [ bc_ejecta ] ) .",

    "the increases of @xmath38 between phase 0  to 200  can be simply explained with an increase of the production in the grains as the active area moves into sunlight .    instead the factor of four decrease passing from phase 200  to phase 300(see fig .",
    "[ fig_sa_phase ] , a ) , corresponding to about 5  h if the periodicity can be trusted ( or 24  h actual elapsed time ) , is more difficult to explain : the cloud must still be well within the fov of the observations because of the low projected velocity .",
    "this strongly supports the hypothesis that grains sublimated away , with a lifetime surely shorter than 24  h and probably of the order of 5  h. if they are transformed into gas , they will contribute no longer to the observations in the continuum bands .",
    "the color of the grains ejected at this pa is similar to that of the surface of short period comets , centaurs and scattered disk tnos ( see online mboss color database * ? ? ?",
    "this color can not be explained by pure ice ; they could be ice particles with a large amount of organic material or just organic grains that sublimate under the solar radiation .",

    "the corresponding spectral slope is then 0@xmath222.4  % /1000   .",
    "this cloud appears during a short range of rotation period , at a phase @xmath27  200 .",
    "the @xmath38 changes by a factor 67 during the whole rotation . as for the other cloud , it decreases by a factor 4 passing from rotation phase of 300to ( 360+)20 , suggesting sublimating grains for this cloud as well .    however , these grains seem to have a gray color , in contrast to those released at pa@xmath2790 .",
    "the appearance of the two clouds at different rotation phases indicates that they are produced by different active regions of the nucleus , and the great difference in their color , suggest that these regions produce different kind of grains .",
    "those at pa@xmath27140  are more similar to the icy chunks discovered by the spacecraft , because ice should have gray color .",
    "also those grains can not be pure ices , since their lifetimes should be much longer that the @xmath8 5 hours indicated here ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "so also these grains should have some impurities of gray color , as for example silicates .",
    "from the analysis of images recorded in the blue and red continuum regions of the visible spectra , we have separated the solid state emission produced by the periodic activity from the normal dust cometary coma of the `` quiet '' comet .",
    "we have found that the coma of the `` quiet '' comet shows a peculiar behavior : its  function is not constant , but shows an increase with nucleo - centric distances @xmath7 , for @xmath182000 - 2500 km , that is not typical of a comet with constant outflow velocity and without fragmentation or sublimation .",
    "the  profiles of the `` quiet coma '' obtained over the 5  nights of observations have a very similar behavior .",
    "of course this is true for the observations where the emission due to the periodic activity does not hide completely the inner coma .",
    "this kind of profile is an indication that the scattering of the grains increases as they move away from the nucleus . since this behavior is the same during a long period of time ( 5 nights ) , the only explanation is that the grains present in the coma of the `` quiet '' comet fragment with the time , increasing their scattering area with the nucleo - centric distance .",
    "the color of the solid state coma of the `` quiet '' comet is red , with a spectral slope of 4.6@xmath221.5 % /1000  , assuming a linear variation with wavelength .    by analyzing the grains produced by the periodic activity we have shown that the released clouds have two privileged projected directions : one at pa@xmath2790  and the other at @xmath27140 .",
    "the profiles of the equivalent  function with @xmath7 of the clouds released in the two direction can be fitted with a constant plus an exponential function .",
    "the cross - sections @xmath38 of the two clouds vary strongly with the rotation phase of the nucleus .",
    "they move very slowly , with projected velocities of the order of 20 m / s , for both pas .",
    "one of the two clouds ( the one with pa@xmath2790 ) has a very red color , of the order of 15@xmath223 % /1000  , while the other seems to have a gray color . assuming a periodic emission with the rotation , both sublimate with lifetimes of the order of 5 h.    during the flyby , the spacecraft has observed for the first time some large chunks around the nucleus , that are supposed to be icy ice particles .",
    "the gray cloud can be then constituted by those chunks .",
    "however , to explain their relatively short lifetimes , those particles also need to have some impurities , gray in color , as for example silicates .",
    "the clouds released in the other direction are very red and sublimate as well with a lifetime of the order of few hours .",
    "so these grains should have lot of organics embedded in them , or they are pure organic grains that sublimate .",
    "it is important to notice that , within @xmath7 equal to 4000 km , where most of the activity takes place , the cross section of the clouds produced by the activity is at most 6% of that of the quiet comet .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude of the 4% contribution of the icy chunks measured by the spacecraft @xcite .",
    "once the full geometrical analysis of the jets observed by the spacecraft becomes available , it will be interesting to connect them with the two clouds described here , and to investigate whether their different characteristics can be traced to different natures of the sublimating area .",
