    "phase transition phenomena in quantum field theories are typically of nonperturbative nature and thus naive perturbation theory based on an expansion in the coupling constant can not be employed .",
    "this is clearly the case of phase changes at high temperatures , where perturbation theory becomes unreliable because powers of the coupling constant become surmounted by powers of the temperature  @xcite .",
    "problems with perturbation theory also happen in phenomena occurring close to critical points , because large fluctuations can emerge in the system due to infrared divergences , thus requiring nonperturbative methods as well in their studies .",
    "this is the case of studies involving second order phase transitions and also in weak first order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "typical examples where these problems can manifest are in studies of symmetry changing phenomena in a hot and dense medium , a subject of interest in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the context of heavy - ion collision experiments , and also in studies of the early universe .",
    "consequently , there is a great deal of interest in investigating thermal field theories describing matter under extreme conditions  @xcite .",
    "familiar nonperturbative methods that have been used to study symmetry changing phenomena at finite temperatures are resummationlike techniques , such as the daisy and superdaisy schemes  @xcite , composite operator methods  @xcite , and field propagator dressing methods  @xcite .",
    "other methods used include expansions in parameters not related to a coupling constant , like the @xmath1 expansion and the @xmath2-expansion  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are numerical methods , the most notably ones are those based on lattice monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "each method has its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "for instance , in numerical methods there may be issues related to numerical precision , lattice spacing , and lattice sizes . in  addition",
    ", there is the notorious problem of simulating fermions on the lattice at finite chemical potentials  @xcite . in any nonperturbative method based on an expansion in some parameter",
    "one has to face the problem of higher order terms becoming increasingly cumbersome , so stalling further analysis .",
    "this is usually the case when carrying out calculations beyond leading order in the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "careless use of a nonperturbative method can also lead to problems like the lack of self - consistency or overcounting of effects .",
    "known examples of such problems are the earlier resummation works dealing with daisy and superdaisy schemes , that at some point were giving wrong results , e.g. predicting a first order transition  @xcite for the @xmath3 theory , an unexpected result since the model belongs to the universality class of the ising model , which is second order .",
    "these methods also predicted a strong first order phase transition in the electroweak standard model , a result proved to be misleading  @xcite .",
    "let us recall that the breakdown of perturbation theory at high temperatures and its poor convergence properties have been dealt with many different methods .",
    "examples are the use of self - consistent approximations  @xcite , hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) resummation  @xcite , perturbative expansions in the coupling constant with resummation implemented with the use of a variational mass parameter , also known as screened perturbation theory ( spt )  @xcite , and the use of two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective actions  @xcite .",
    "the 2pi method , in particular , leads to a much better convergence of thermodynamic quantities ( like the pressure ) as compared to some of the other methods  @xcite .",
    "related to the 2pi method is the @xmath4-derivable technique , which has been used to study the thermodynamics of scalar and gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with the 2pi effective actions is that the renormalization procedure is nontrivial  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there seems that the @xmath4-derivable technique breaks down for a coupling beyond some value  @xcite .    in general , it is desirable that any analytical nonperturbative method obey two basic requirements .",
    "first , it should be self - consistent , and second , it should produce useful results already at lowest orders without the need for going to higher orders .",
    "that is , it should produce results that quickly converge at some order where calculations are still feasible analytically or semianalytically . though some of the cited methods may satisfy one , or to some extent both of these requirements , in the present paper we are particularly interested in the one known as the linear @xmath0 expansion ( lde )  @xcite , a nonperturbative method that has been used successfully in different contexts related to thermal field theories  @xcite and in many other theories  for a long , but",
    "far from complete list of references see refs .  @xcite . in the lde ,",
    "a linear interpolation on the original model lagrangian density is performed in terms of a fictitious expansion parameter @xmath0 , which is used only for bookkeeping purposes and set at the end equal to one .",
    "the standard application of the lde to a theory described by a lagrangian density @xmath5 starts with an interpolation defined by @xmath6\\ ; , \\label{opt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the lagrangian density of a solvable theory , which is modified by the introduction of an arbitrary mass parameter ( or parameters ) @xmath8 .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath9 interpolates between the solvable @xmath10 ( when @xmath11 ) and the original @xmath5 ( when @xmath12 ) . the procedure defined by eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) leads to modified feynman vertices , that become multiplied by @xmath0 , and modified propagators , that now depend on @xmath8 .",
    "all quantities evaluated at any finite order in the lde will then depend explicitly on @xmath8 , unless one could perform a calculation to all orders .",
    "up to this stage the results remain strictly perturbative and very similar to the ones obtained via an ordinary perturbative calculation .",
    "it is through the freedom in fixing @xmath8 that nonperturbative results can be generated in this method .",
    "since @xmath8 does not belong to the original theory , one may fix it requiring that a physical quantity @xmath13 , calculated perturbatively to order-@xmath14 , be evaluated at the value where it is less sensitive to this parameter .",
    "this criterion , known as the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) , translates into the variational relation  @xcite @xmath15 the optimum value @xmath16 which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ pms ] ) is a function of the original parameters of the theory . in particular",
    ", @xmath16 is a nontrivial function of the couplings and because of this nonperturbative results are generated .",
    "another optimization procedure used is known as the fastest apparent convergence ( fac ) criterion  @xcite .",
    "it requires from the @xmath17-th coefficient of the perturbative expansion @xmath18 that @xmath19\\bigr|_{\\delta=1 } = 0\\ ; , \\label{fac}\\ ] ] which is just equivalent to taking the @xmath17-th coefficient ( at @xmath20 ) in eq .  ( [ fac0 ] ) equal to zero .",
    "one should note that it is not at all guaranteed that the condition in eq .",
    "( [ pms ] ) has a nontrivial solution . in cases where this may happen , the second criterion , eq .",
    "( [ fac ] ) , may be more appropriate .",
    "one example where the condition given by eq .",
    "( [ pms ] ) fails to produce a nontrivial solution was in the problem studied by the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite , who applied the lde to compute the effective potential in superspace . there",
    ", the authors found that while the pms condition was unable to give a nonperturbative solution to the effective potential , the fac criterion worked perfectly well .",
    "of course , in many situations both optimization criteria may work and in this case one may ask whether they lead to equivalent results .",
    "previous studies indicated that this is indeed so , but a full comparison of results obtained with both optimization criteria is still lacking . another issue associated with",
    "the lde is its convergence .",
    "rigorous lde convergence proofs have been obtained for the problem of the quantum anharmonic oscillator , at zero temperature , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , while its partition function at finite temperatures was considered in  @xcite . for quantum field theories , ref .",
    "@xcite has proved convergence for a particular perturbative series in an asymptotically - free , renormalizable model at zero temperature . for a critical @xmath3 @xmath21 theory in three dimensions the issue of convergence",
    "was studied in  @xcite employing both pms and fac optimization criteria . finally , regarding the possible solutions that can emerge from the optimization criteria ( pms or fac ) , we must use a definite approach in selecting the optimum root @xmath16 from either eq .",
    "( [ pms ] ) or ( [ fac ] ) .",
    "the problem of dealing with the many possible solutions for @xmath22 was treated in details in the first two papers cited in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the convergence of the lde was also studied in details .",
    "typically , the higher the order in @xmath0 , the more solutions can appear .",
    "as shown in those references , all solutions at each given order in @xmath0 can be classified into families .",
    "the optimum value for @xmath8 is chosen as follows : the trivial solutions for @xmath22 , e.g. @xmath23 and those that are not dependent on the coupling constant ( and thus can not lead to nonperturbative results ) are not considered .",
    "in addition to these , at first order there is only one nontrivial solution ( first family ) , consistent with all our approximations , ( like the high - temperature approximation , used later in our calculations ) .",
    "this family is then followed in the next orders and used in all our calculations .",
    "as proved in earlier references with the lde method , this is a consistent and unambiguous way for choosing the optimum value for @xmath8 .",
    "it is important to stress that in the method of the lde the selection and evaluation of feynman diagrams proceed in the same fashion as in ordinary perturbation theory , including the renormalization procedure  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained are free from infrared divergences , even at the critical point and in its neighborhood , thus making it a particularly suitable method to study phase transition phenomena in quantum field theories .",
    "it is important to recall here that there are similarities between the lde and the spt methods .",
    "in particular , the implementation of the latter can be put in a form similar to the lde by means of a modified loop expansion  @xcite , named optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) in this reference .",
    "but there are also some major differences between these methods .",
    "for instance , in the lde no assumption is made _ a priori _ for the parameter @xmath8 , while in the spt / opt it is assumed that such a mass term is already of some order in the coupling constant .",
    "the implication of this is that the order counting of loop expansion has to be readjusted accordingly .    in the present paper",
    "we study the application of the lde to the @xmath24 theory",
    ". we will study the applicability of the pms and fac optimization criteria for the symmetric and broken phases of the theory , and compare results obtained with both methods .",
    "in addition , in the present work we choose to optimize the free energy , instead of the self - energy like in many other works employing the lde , particularly refs .",
    "there are several reasons for doing so  @xcite , but an important one is that in some situations it might happen that the optimization of the self - energy does not lead to nontrivial solutions , while optimization of the free energy with pms or fac are seen to lead to nontrivial solutions already at first order in @xmath0 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath25 , the pressure @xmath26 , and the background dependent free energy @xmath27 are obtained here in an explicit calculation up to order @xmath28 . calculations at this order require a calculation of vacuum terms up to three loops .",
    "since the thermodynamics of this model has been extensively studied before in the literature with a number of methods , our calculation here will be useful to benchmark the application of the lde and its two main optimization procedures against those previous applications .",
    "in addition , we compare our results with those obtained with standard perturbation theory .",
    "besides correctly reproducing the expected second order phase transition pattern for the model , our results at order @xmath28 are shown to be sufficient to obtain the thermodynamics of the model , in the sense that the results at @xmath29 are not much different from the ones at @xmath30 . the results point towards a quickly convergent lde , as already indicated in previous studies with different models under different conditions  @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the interpolation procedure for the model . in  sec .",
    "iii we compute the free energy in the symmetric and broken phases to @xmath29 . in  sec .",
    "iv we present the results obtained from the optimization procedures .",
    "the pressure is evaluated and contrasted order by order with the one obtained within perturbation theory .",

    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the interpolation defined by eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) when applied for the standard @xmath31 model gives @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the part of the lagrangian density carrying the renormalization terms needed to render the model finite .",

    "@xcite within the context of the spt , so we will not repeat those same renormalization details here .",
    "one should also note that the only  new \" terms introduced by the @xmath0-expansion interpolation are quadratic terms and so the renormalizability of the original theory is not changed .",

    "[ fig : p_fac+pms_d2 ] we plot side by side our results for the pressure at order @xmath28 using the pms and fac optimization criteria .",
    "it is seen as an excellent agreement between the two optimization criteria and it shows the equivalence of these two optimization procedures .     using the pms and fac optimization criteria . ]    a side by side comparison of the order @xmath28 result for the pressure ( from either the pms or fac ) with the 2pi two - loop result of ref .",
    "@xcite ( second panel of theirs fig .",
    "1 ) shows an excellent agreement between the two results .",
    "since operationally the lde is much simpler to be implemented than the 2pi calculation and also when compared with other methods , like those based on the renormalization group and schwinger - dyson equations , this may be a great advantage of the lde .",
    "many previous applications of the lde to a large variety of problems ( cited previously ) also confirm the strength of the method .",
    "its strength comes basically from the fact that its implementation is similar to that of standard perturbation theory .",
    "the important and fundamental difference with standard perturbation theory resides in the optimization procedure that fixes an initial , _ a priori _ , arbitrary parameter , @xmath8 .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate what kind of role the optimum @xmath8 represents in the lde after optimization .",
    "this is partially clarified in the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta2_lde_d1 ] , where we show the optimum @xmath8 as a function of the renormalized coupling constant .",
    "it shows that by increasing the order in @xmath0 , @xmath16 becomes closer and closer to the thermal mass @xmath120 , here computed at one - loop order for simplicity . in general",
    ", we can extrapolate this expectation and say that the expected optimum value for @xmath8 should be the ( quantum and ) thermal mass ( quadratic in the field ) corrections , as would be derived from a true gap equation .",
    "this is in fact confirmed by the many applications of the lde to the gross - neveu model  @xcite , in which case exact results are known ( in the large-@xmath121 approximation ) and can then be readily compared with the results obtained from the lde method applied to that model .     with respect to the renormalized coupling constant and evaluated at order @xmath0 and @xmath28 using the fac optimization criterion .",
    "the parameters used are the same as in the previous figures . ]",
    "let us now turn to the symmetry broken case ( with negative square mass term in the classical potential ) .",
    "for this case we found that only the fac optimization criterion leads to nontrivial solutions for @xmath8 .",
    "the fac criterion is applied to the free energy and the resulting nonlinear equation is solved simultaneously with the equation giving the minimum condition for the field ( thermal ) expectation value , @xmath122 , given by the condition @xmath123 } { d\\ , \\varphi } \\right\\vert _ { \\varphi = \\nu(t ) } = 0\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as it is well known , the phase transition in the pure scalar theory is second order  @xcite , as required by universality reasons .",
    "our results for the free energy using the fac criterion indicate a second order phase transition .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : veff ] , where the free energy for @xmath124 is plotted for different temperature values .",
    "the critical temperature obtained here is @xmath125 , consistent with the perturbative prediction @xcite and other nonperturbative calculations @xcite .",
    "another quantity that indicates that the transition is a continuous one is the temperature evolution of the minimum of free energy , @xmath122 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nut ] for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .     evaluated at order @xmath28 and",
    "using the fac optimization criterion , for three different temperatures : @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , where @xmath131 ( in units of the renormalization scale @xmath71 ) . here",
    "we have set @xmath132 . ]     at order @xmath28 obtained with the fac optimization criterion .",
    "here @xmath133 is the tree - level minimum of the bare free energy . ]",
    "[ fig : nut ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt2 ] we show the temperature dependence of the thermal mass , @xmath120 , as derived from the free energy ,",
    "@xmath134}{d^2 \\varphi}\\bigr|_{\\varphi=0}\\;. \\label{mt2}\\ ] ] we once again can notice a continuous and smooth transition .",
    "we note that one can determine the critical temperature by looking at which value of @xmath135 @xmath136 changes sign and check whether this gives the same result for @xmath25 as obtained from @xmath137 ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nut ] ) .     evaluated with the fac criterion for two values of the coupling constant @xmath108 .",
    "we use in this plot @xmath132 . ]",
    "one of the motivations for using the lde to study the thermodynamics of the scalar field theory at high temperatures , as done in this work , was its ease of implementation and renormalization , which is no different from those of the standard perturbation theory .",
    "one recalls that similar studies in the context of the 2pi and related methods typically face difficulties in the renormalization procedure , making their applicability a nontrivial task .",
    "in addition , the lde method , differently from other methods , like spt ( or opt - optimized perturbation theory ) , makes no assumption on the introduced mass parameter @xmath8 , thus we do not need to adjust the order of the loop expansion accordingly .    by using the lde , we have studied the thermodynamics of the @xmath3 scalar field theory in the symmetric and broken phases .",
    "the lde is used with two popular optimization procedures , known as pms and fac .",
    "there are two major differences with the work we have done here and previous ones , like e.g. in refs .",
    "first , while in general the pms procedure is the favorite optimization criterion in the literature related to the lde and similar methods , we here have shown that the fac procedure leads to numerically indistinguishable results from the ones obtained with the pms .",
    "in addition , while there may be cases where the pms procedure leads to trivial results only , the same may not be the case for the fac ( here we have shown this to be the case in the broken phase ) . in this sense",
    "they can be used in a complementary way , when pms fails , one can try fac , or vice - versa . secondly , unlike in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the quantity optimized is the self - energy , here we choose to optimize the free energy .",
    "one advantage of this is that , while there is no solution for the lde at first order when optimizing the self - energy , we do find solutions when optimizing the free energy already at first order in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the optimization of the free energy can be shown to immediately lead to the solution of the gap equation ( here verified numerically through the results for the optimum @xmath8 ) , while in optimizing the self - energy further constraints must be employed , as for example renormalization group equations . in the numerical studies performed in the present work",
    ", we have shown that the optimum @xmath8 carries both temperature and coupling constant contributions .",
    "thus , the lde with optimization of the free energy implements automatically a nonperturbative resummation of the thermal corrections , in conformity with analytical results produced when this method was used to study the gross - neveu model in ref .",
    "@xcite , from which exact solutions are available and a close comparison with the lde results is possible .    by studying the behavior of the pressure and contrasting the results obtained with perturbation theory and the 2pi method , we have shown that the lde leads to convergent results already at lowest order in the lde expansion parameter @xmath0 , with the first and second order results changing only slightly and producing results consistent with the 2pi nonperturbative method . in addition ,",
    "as already mentioned above , we have shown that both optimization procedures , fac and pms , lead to equivalent results for the pressure .",
    "another important result of our work is that the lde is shown to be adequate for studying phase transitions at high temperatures .",
    "in particular , when applied to the phase transition in the @xmath3 , the lde predicts the correct order of the phase transition , which is second order , in agreement with general results of statistical mechanics . besides this ,",
    "since the lde method automatically produces an infrared cutoff , the results are shown to be valid and applicable _ below _ , _ above _ , and _ at _ the critical temperature @xmath25 , showing that the lde circumvents the usual problem seen in perturbation theory , namely , the appearance of infrared divergences close to critical points .",
    "we would like to thank u. reinosa for helpful discussions regarding their 2pi results and the renormalization issues in the method .",
    "we would like to thank f. gardim for discussions on related matters .",
