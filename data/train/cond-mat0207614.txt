    "self - affine interfaces generated by nonequilibrium surface growth have been intensively studied in recent years [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "kinetic roughening models as ballistic deposition @xcite , eden model @xcite , solid - on - solid model ( sos ) with surface relaxation @xcite , sos with refuse @xcite and sos with diffusion @xcite are some examples of growth models that belongs to distinct universality classes .",
    "theoretically , these growth processes are studied in three different schemes : through a continuum description using langevin - like equation and renormalization group analisys for solving it ; through numerical solutions of these equations ; and through computer simulations of discrete models .",
    "the main goal is to obtain the universality class of a specific model and to get information about the presence of nonlinearities and broken symmetries .    in computer simulation of lattice growth models ,",
    "interfaces are described by a discrete set @xmath6 which represents the height of a site @xmath7 at the time @xmath8 .",
    "such an interface has @xmath9 sites , where @xmath10 is the linear size and @xmath2 is the dimension of the substrate .",
    "the roughness of the interface @xmath11 is defined as the root mean square of the @xmath12 distribution , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mean height at time @xmath8 and the angular brackets means the average over independent samples .",
    "the universality class of a discrete growth model is obtained through the temporal and spatial behaviors of roughness . in the most of kinetic roughening processes , which starts at @xmath15 from a flat substrate ,",
    "the temporal behavior of roughness is described by the power law behavior , @xmath16 , when @xmath17 , and its spatial behavior , in the steady state , is described by @xmath18 , for @xmath19 .",
    "the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath20 are the growth and roughness exponents , respectivelly , and @xmath21 is the saturation time .",
    "these two behaviors are joined at the family and vicsek dynamical scaling relation@xcite @xmath22 where the function @xmath23 must be @xmath10-independent .",
    "this function scales as @xmath24 for short times and tends to a constant in the steady state .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath25 is related with @xmath20 and @xmath4 through the relationship @xmath26 and it shows how the saturation time depends on the system size @xmath10 : @xmath27 .",
    "two of these exponents predict which universality class a model belongs to .",
    "these universality classes are related to the dominant term of the stochastic differential equation in the continuum limit . in the next section ,",
    "we describe two stochastic differential equations which represent two distinct universality classes .",
    "the first is a linear equation proposed , in 1982 , by edwards and wilkinson ( ew equation ) @xcite .",
    "the second is a nonlinear equation , introduced by kardar , parisi and zhang in 1986 ( kpz equation ) @xcite . when the nonlinear term of this equation is null , the ew linear equation is recuperated .    in this article",
    ", we report on simulations of a growth model with restricted relaxation process ( called rr model ) , which was proposed in order to study the crossover between the linear and nonlinear regimes of the kpz equation .",
    "the rr combines features of the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) model @xcite , related to the ew linear equation , and the kim - kosterlitz ( kk ) model @xcite , related to the kpz nonlinear equation .",
    "the crossover between linear and nonlinear regimes of the kpz equation was studied numerically in @xmath0 and @xmath1 through numerical solutions of this equation where variations of the amount of nonlinearity was allowed .",
    "moser and kertsz @xcite found , in @xmath0 , the growth exponent @xmath28 for all values of the nonlinearity . in @xmath1 ,",
    "the authors have found @xmath29 , close to the kim and kosterlitz value @xcite .",
    "so , a crossover between linear and nonlinear regimes was not verified .",
    "grossmann , guo and grant @xcite also have obtained numerical solutions of kpz equation where the surface tension was fixed and the nonlinear parameter was continuously changed . for small systems , the authors have found growth exponents in the interval @xmath30 .",
    "so , the crossover was characterized by a continuum change in the growth exponent , which in @xmath0 means that the dynamical exponent @xmath25 depends on the amount of the nonlinearity .",
    "this continuous crossover in @xmath0 was also verified by simulations on growth models @xcite .",
    "theoretically , in @xmath0 , nattermann and tang @xcite have studied the kpz equation in the low nonlinear limit through renormalization group analisys and they have obtained a different result : two behaviors separated by a characteristic time @xmath5 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the linear behavior of roughness was found , while for @xmath32 , the nonlinearity dominates .",
    "this article is organized in sections .",
    "the next section presents the general approach for kinetic roughening and describes the ew and kk models . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the rr model and we show our results which confirm the theoretical previsions of natterman and tang @xcite and , in section iv , we finally show our conclusions .",
    "in the continuum ( coarse - grained ) description , the interface motion is described through langevin - like equations [ 1 - 3 ] , @xmath33~~.\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the deposition rate and its noise , respectively .",
    "this white noise has zero mean and variance given by @xmath36 @xmath37 $ ] is the term related to the correlations between neighbors which can have linear and nonlinear functions of @xmath38 .    our interest is focused on the sos model with surface relaxation @xcite and at the sos model with restriction @xcite .",
    "the sos model with surface relaxation , introduced by edwards and wilkinson @xcite in 1982 , is a random deposition of particles where the difference of height constraint between the neighbors @xmath39 of a site @xmath7 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the parameter that controls the roughness . in this work",
    ", we always use @xmath42 .",
    "if the height of the deposited particle on the site @xmath7 does not satisfy the height constraint , this particle must be moved to a local miminum .",
    "family @xcite have obtained for this model , in @xmath0 , the exponents @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this result indicates that this model , in a coarse - grained limit , belongs to the universality class defined by the ew equation @xmath45 where the laplacian term is related to the surface relaxation process .",
    "the exponents of this linear equation , obtained through fourier analysis @xcite , are @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath0 . for @xmath1 , which is the critical dimension of eq.6 , these exponents are @xmath49 which means that the roughness has logarithimic behavior in space and time ( @xmath50 , for @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , for @xmath53 ) .",
    "both , the ew model and the ew equation , generate gaussian height distributions as well .    in the sos model with restriction",
    ", particles are also randomly deposited onto a substrate and the difference of height constraint is the same of the ew model , eq.5 , but any kind of relaxation is allowed . if the height of a deposited particle does not satisfy eq.5 , this choice must be refused , that is , the particle evaporates .",
    "this model was proposed in 1989 by kim and kosterlitz @xcite in order to study nonlinear kinetic roughening in high dimensions .",
    "they numerically showed , in @xmath0 , that this model , named kk model , belongs to the universality class of the well known kpz equation , proposed by kardar , parisi and zhang @xcite @xmath54^{2}.\\ ] ] the appearance of the nonlinear term @xmath55^{2}$ ] is due to the lateral growth , that is , the dependence of the growth velocity on a local normal of the growing interface , or to the appearance of a perpendicular driven force that leads to a growth velocity greater or smaller than the deposition rate @xmath34 . in the case of the kk model , for example",
    ", the refuse mechanism makes the growth velocity smaller than the deposition rate . in @xmath0 ,",
    "the exponents of this equation @xcite are @xmath28 , @xmath47 and @xmath56 . in @xmath1 ,",
    "the analytical solution is not known . in @xmath0 ,",
    "numerical simulations of the kk model @xcite indicate @xmath57 and the @xmath20-exponent close to the expected value @xmath58 and , in @xmath1 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "eq.7 is not invariant under the @xmath61 transformation , which means that the up - down symmetry is broken in surfaces generated by a kpz process .",
    "this fact leads to deviations in the gaussian caracter of the height distributions which can be measured using other moments of the distribution .",
    "the eq.1 can be generalized for any moments of height distribution as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the order of the moment .",
    "note that the roughness @xmath64 is related to the second moment : @xmath65 .",
    "a growing profile has up - down symmetry when positive and negative local curvatures are equals , and , in this case , @xmath66 vanishes . on the other hand , when asymmetries are present , @xmath67 .",
    "the skewness , defined by @xmath68 is the ideal measurement of deviations from gaussian behavior . in the case of the ew model , @xmath69 always . for systems in kpz class in @xmath0 , krug",
    "_ @xcite have indicated @xmath70 as an universal value in the transient state . in the steady state",
    ", the profile shows a random - walk character , that is , the height distribution is gaussian and @xmath71 . in @xmath1 ,",
    "numerical simulations of the kk model indicate @xmath72 , in the transient state , and @xmath73 , in the steady state @xcite .",
    "in this article , we report on simulations of the growth model with restricted surface relaxation model ( rr model ) . in the ew model , each incoming particle must search the local minima when the height constraint ( eq.5 ) is not satisfied .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath3 that is the number of lattice units allowed for the relaxation process .",
    "if the deposited particle does not find the minimum after @xmath3 relaxations , then this choice must be refused , as in kk model . for @xmath74 , the kk model",
    "is recuperated and @xmath75 yields the ew model .",
    "figure 1 shows the log - log plot of roughness @xmath64 vs time @xmath8 for a system with @xmath76 sites and @xmath77 .",
    "the time unity means @xmath9 attempts of deposition .",
    "the two straight lines in the figure are showing the power - law fits with @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
    "the intersection of these two lines define the crossover time @xmath5 .",
    "this crossover is easy to understand considering the increase of roughness : in short times , when the roughness is still small , particles do not need to relax very much for seaching local minima , so the linear behavior might dominate .",
    "in large times , on the other hand , we note the appearance of relaxation lenghts bigger than those observed in short times . as relaxation processes",
    "are linked to refuse processes in this model , the system undergoes a crossover to the nonlinear behavior . the crossover time @xmath5 is independent of the system size @xmath10 and it is only a function of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "for a better understanding of this crossover we study the statistics of relaxations in the ew model , where relaxations of all sizes can occur . at the time @xmath8 ,",
    "be @xmath82 the mean number of particles which diffused @xmath83 sites searching local minima .",
    "so , @xmath83 relaxations occur with probability @xmath84 these probabilities have an initial temporal dependence and a steady state @xmath85 , whose values are shown in table 1 .",
    "we note a strong decrease of the probability with the number of sites diffused , which shows the rare ocurrences of the relaxation with large relaxation lenghts .",
    "it is interesting to analyse the approach of this probability to the steady state because each @xmath86 has different convergence times . for doing this ,",
    "we define a normalised probability of @xmath83 relaxations as @xmath87 figure 2 shows the plots of @xmath88 vs @xmath8 for @xmath89 for the ew model with @xmath76 .",
    "note the differences among the convergences to each steady state : the temporal behaviors of @xmath90 and @xmath91 quickly go to its steady values , while @xmath92 and @xmath93 tend to unity only at @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "this fact suggests that large relaxation lenghts might occur at large deposition times with small probabilities .",
    "so , drawing attention to the curve @xmath96 vs @xmath8 , we observe that the saturation occurs at @xmath94 . in the rr model with @xmath77",
    ", we estimate @xmath97 , which indicates that the crossover from linear to nonlinear behaviors of the rr model occurs , for a value of @xmath3 , when @xmath98 is time independent .",
    "this behavior of @xmath99 is responsible for the dependence of the crossover time @xmath5 with the parameter @xmath3 in the rr model .",
    "figure 3 shows clearly this dependence with the plots of @xmath100 vs @xmath8 for : ( a ) @xmath46 and ( b ) @xmath28 , with @xmath101 and @xmath76 . in ( a )",
    ", the curve with @xmath74 always grows , while the curve for @xmath102 remains constant , indicating that @xmath46 , for this value of @xmath10 , is the correct value for @xmath102 ( ew behavior ) and a noncorrect for @xmath74 ( kk nonlinear behavior ) . in ( b )",
    "similar conclusions are obtained with @xmath28 . for @xmath77 , the initial linear and the asymptotic kpz behaviors",
    "are well observed in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "note that the crossover for @xmath77 occurs when the @xmath96 is time independent , that is , when @xmath103 , in figure 2 .",
    "for @xmath102 , we observe only the linear behavior because the total deposition time is smaller than the crossover time @xmath5 .    in order to do a more complete characterization of this crossover",
    ", we also analyse the temporal behavior of the skewness @xmath104 .",
    "figure 4 shows plots of @xmath104 vs @xmath8 for @xmath76 and several values of the parameter @xmath3 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the skewness @xmath105 goes quickly to the kpz transient value @xmath106 .",
    "as we have explained , @xmath107 means that the interfaces have not up - down symmetry .",
    "we find for @xmath77 , a slower approach to the kpz value , than observed for @xmath74 , indicating that the up - down symmetry is gradually lost when @xmath108 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath109 , we clearly observe an initial behavior where @xmath110 and an approach faster to the kpz value at @xmath95 .",
    "the temporal dependence of @xmath104 , which is an independent measurement of the universality class , also indicates an initial linear behavior and the kpz behavior in asymptotic times .",
    "it is also interesting to study this crossover in @xmath1 , because changes in the morphology are expected in this dimension . for the kk model",
    ", we have power - law divergencies of roughness ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) , while the ew model shows logarithmic divergences ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 .    in order to avoid saturation effects",
    ", we work with @xmath115 ( 4@xmath116 sites ) , and we do simulations until @xmath117 . due to the computational cost , we perform only two samples for each value of the parameter @xmath3 and , consequently , the data quality in this section is poorer than in the previous subsection .",
    "the crossover is analysed through a similar process done in @xmath0 .",
    "we expect logarithmic behavior when the linear term dominates , so we define @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the @xmath3-dependent coefficients obtained through a logarithmic regression in the interval @xmath121 . in figure 5 , we plot the temporal behavior of the function @xmath122 , in a semi - logarithmic scale . if the temporal behavior of the roughness is logarithmic , @xmath122 must be a constant , equal to one .",
    "we note that this occurs for @xmath123 , but , for @xmath124 , this constant behavior remains until @xmath125 . after this time",
    ", there is a crossover to the power law behavior .",
    "however , until the studied time , it is not possible to determine the exponent .    in order to verify the existence of a power law behavior with the kpz exponent @xmath4 , we need to analyse values of the parameter @xmath3 smaller than @xmath124 , that is , we need to do continuum variations in @xmath3 .",
    "so , we do this by assinging a probability @xmath3 for the particle relax one lattice unit and a probability @xmath126 for the particle be evaporated . in figure 6 , we show the graph of @xmath127 vs @xmath8 , for @xmath74 ( kk model ) and @xmath128 . in this graph",
    ", it was used @xmath46 which is the exponent for the kk model in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if the temporal behavior of the roughness has a power law behavior with this exponent , the curves must be horizontal .",
    "for the rr model ( @xmath129 ) , the curves show asymptotic approaches to this nonlinear behavior . for greater values of the parameter @xmath3 , the crossover time to this behavior occurs for times greater than the time studied ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we have studied the model with restricted surface relaxation which combines the main features of the model with surface relaxation ( ew model ) and the model with refuse ( kk model ) .",
    "a power - law temporal behavior of roughness with two growth exponents was observed in @xmath0 : the linear growth exponent , @xmath46 , occurs in short times and the nonlinear one , @xmath28 , appears in the asymptotic limit .",
    "this result suggests the following description : the linear term of the kpz equation ( eq.7 ) dominates in short times and the nonlinear term dominates in asymptotic times .",
    "we also noted that the crossover time @xmath5 is independent of the system size @xmath10 and it is only function of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this result corroborates the renormalization group solution made by nattermann and tang @xcite , where the kpz equation with small nonlinear term was considered . in @xmath1 , we have found indications of the same kind of crossover : a logarithmic temporal behavior of roughness in short times , which is related to the linear ew equation , and a power - law behavior with @xmath130 in asymptotic times , related to the nonlinear kpz equation .",
