    "the propagation of cosmic rays ( crs ) is affected by their interaction with a magnetic field .",
    "this field is turbulent and therefore , the resonant interaction of cosmic rays with mhd turbulence has been discussed by many authors as the principal mechanism to scatter and isotropize cosmic rays ( schlickeiser 2002 , yan & lazarian 2002 ) . although cosmic ray diffusion can happen while cosmic rays follow wandering magnetic fields ( jokipii 1966 ) , the acceleration of cosmic rays requires efficient scattering . for instance , scattering of cosmic rays back into the shock is a vital component of the first order fermi acceleration ( see longair 1997 ) .",
    "+ one important interaction between crs and mhd turbulence is gyroresonance scattering .",
    "while the propagation of most moderate energy crs do nt sense slower time variations of turbulence , turbulence is dynamical for low energy crs or when the parallel speed of crs becomes comparable with alfvn speed @xmath0 .",
    "dynamical mhd turbulence leads to resonance broadening so that a breit - wigner - type function instead of a @xmath1 function should be used ( schlickeiser & achatz 1993 , bieber et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this case",
    "crs interact with a whole range of turbulence from large to small scales .",
    "+ scattering of crs can not happen by the magnetic wave which frequency in the particle frame is much lower than the larmor frequency .",
    "indeed if magnetic field changes much slower than the particle gyrorates , the quantity @xmath2 is preserved ( landau & lifshitz 1957 ) . as the result while the pitch - angle of the particle changes as the wave passes by the total change of the angle is zero .    in quasilinear theory ( qlt )",
    "the assumption of unperturbed orbit results in non - conservation of the adiabatic invariant @xmath3 .",
    "whereas small scale contribution corresponds to the sharp resonance in magnetostatic limit , the contribution from slow large scale can be overestimated by qlt since the adiabatic invariant ought to be conserved when the electromagnetic field varies on a time scale longer than the gyroperiods of crs @xmath4 ( chandran 2000 , yan & lazarian 2003 ) .",
    "+ in qlt the turbulent field is presented in terms of fourier modes .",
    "it is clear that the slow ( compared to the particle larmor frequency ) components can not scatter cosmic rays as the consequence of the preservation of the adiabatic invariant .",
    "however , this effect is not treated in the conventional qlt , which has been widely used to obtained a lot of results mostly within the framework of the slab model of turbulence .",
    "how reliable are those results ?",
    "we attempt to answer this question within this paper .",
    "therefore , we will discuss the different contributions from large and small scales for the slab model of turbulence .",
    "we will give the regimes where the interaction is dominated by large and small scale contributions .",
    "this will give us a hint on the limitation range where quasilinear approximation is a good approximation . because qlt is considered as a standard tool for the calculation of diffusion coefficients ( e. g. bieber et al .",
    "1994 , chandran 2000 , schlickeiser 2002 , yan & lazarian 2003 ) it is of great significance to explore the validity of the quasilinear approximation .",
    "+ within quasilinear theory the parallel mean free path @xmath5 results from the pitch - angle - cosine ( @xmath6 ) average of the inverse of the pitch - angle fokker - planck coefficient @xmath7 as ( jokipii 1966 , hasselmann & wibberenz 1968 , earl 1974 ) _ =3 v 8 _ -1^+1 d .",

    "@xmath13 corresponds to the magnetostatic limit whereas @xmath14 corresponds to strongly dynamical turbulence .",
