    "the application of scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( stm ) techniques to the cuo chain planes in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) has provided new insights on the physics of these quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) electronic structures .",
    "these experimental studies have shown in real space the presence of charge modulations along the chains at low temperature , inside the superconducting phase.@xcite these charge oscillations had been inferred earlier from neutron scattering experiments on the same compound.@xcite taking together results from both band calculations@xcite and angle - resolved photoemission@xcite ( arpes ) indicating a chain filling close to one quarter , it turns out that the observed charge modulations have a @xmath0 wavenumber .",
    "although earlier stm studies@xcite had given indications of the presence of charge oscillations on the chains , the present interest on these features comes from a more recent set of experiments exploring the interplay between the chain plane and the cuo@xmath1 plane in ybco . on one side ,",
    "the chains ( running along the * b * direction ) may contribute to the in - plane resistivity anisotropy in this compound.@xcite it is also important to notice that stripes in cuo@xmath1 planes also run along the * b * direction , may be not coincidentally . on the other side ,",
    "there have been experimental indications of a superfluid density induced on the chains due to the proximity to the cuo@xmath1 planes.@xcite although the interpretation of this last set of experiments is still controversial@xcite , one recent theoretical study@xcite offers an explanation of stm results@xcite based on this scenario of proximity induced chain superconductivity ( sc ) . in this model ,",
    "the resonances in the chains arise from the interference between magnetic impurities in the chains .",
    "alternatively , we believe it is necessary to search for explanations of these experimental results based on models which capture the intrinsic electronic interactions on the chains .",
    "eventually , in this kind of models , the sc on the cuo@xmath1 planes could modify at an effective level the coupling constants of the intrachain interactions .",
    "this approach connects the present study to the more general theoretical interest in various types of charge inhomogeneities appearing in strongly correlated electron systems in low spatial dimensions .",
    "in fact , in addition to the relevance of the presence of charge oscillations in the chains to the physics of the cuo@xmath1 planes , it has been emphasized that precisely the assumed strong coulomb interactions in the cuprates would naively favour a @xmath4 instead of the observed @xmath0 wavenumber of the charge modulations.@xcite    since cuo chains are cut by oxygen depletion , we will try to describe the charge modulations as generalized friedel oscillations ( fo ) starting at the open end of the resulting fragments .",
    "a very recent numerical and analytical study@xcite on the 1d one - band hubbard model has indeed found a crossover from @xmath0 to @xmath4 fo as the strength of the onsite coulomb interaction @xmath5 is increased .",
    "we are going to examine a two - band hubbard model , appropriate for the cuo chains , where the situation is more complex due to different coulomb repulsions on cu and o ions , in addition to the charge transfer between them.@xcite it is interesting to notice that arpes shows@xcite a chain s fermi surface in agreement with band calculations and at the same time the dispersion along the chain direction agrees with the holon band predicted by strongly correlated theories.@xcite hence , although the coulomb repulsion on cu ions is large , it does not automatically imply a strongly correlated behavior on any given physical quantity .",
    "in particular , we will show a complex dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath4 fo with respect to the coulomb interactions and charge transfer parameter .",
    "the model here studied does not include electron - lattice coupling which is another possibility of inducing @xmath0 instabilities .",
    "experimentally@xcite , it has been suggested that standard lattice phonons are unlikely to reproduce the observed features .",
    "finally , both in order to help the understanding of our results and in order to extend the scope of this study , we will consider a somewhat large variation of interaction parameters , and in addition to quarter - filling , dopings close to half - filling , and also electron doped chains will also be studied .",
    "besides , we will consider open ends occupied with o ions and with cu ions .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ phasediag ] ,",
    "we describe the model and method of calculation , and we show the numerical results for density oscillations .",
    "the theoretical and experimental implications of these results are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the model studied is the 1d two - band hubbard model defined as : @xmath6 where , @xmath7 creates a hole with spin @xmath8 at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the sums run over @xmath12 , @xmath13 : number of unit cells , and cu ( o ) ions occupy odd ( even ) sites .",
    "all our results shown below correspond to @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . the number of holes ( @xmath18 ) is larger than @xmath13 for hole doped systems in which case the filling is computed as @xmath19 , or smaller than @xmath13 for electron doped systems in which case the filling is computed as @xmath20 . at half filling @xmath21 .",
    "the numerical technique employed in the present study is the density matrix renormalization group algorithm ( dmrg).@xcite the most important quantity measured by this technique is the on - site charge density , @xmath22 .",
    "most results were obtained with a truncation number @xmath23 . for several cases we examined also @xmath24 and @xmath25 with almost indistinguishable results .    in principle , we are interested in the effect of oxygen depletion which implies that cuo chains are cut at oxygen sites .",
    "these depleted oxygens could be modeled by just imposing open boundary conditions on chains with odd number of sites with the two end sites corresponding to cu - ions .",
    "however , it is technically convenient to use chains with even number of sites which implies that one end is occupied by an oxygen ion and the other end site by a copper ion .",
    "the open end with an o ion would correspond to a nonmagnetic impurity , for example a zn ion replacing a cu ion.@xcite if one assumes that the friedel oscillations from both ends do not have nonlinear superposition , i.e. both oscillation are independent of each other , then the use of even number of sites allows us the simultaneous study of both types of impurities in a single chain .",
    "since , as said in the introduction , friedel oscillations appear due to oxygen depleted sites acting as impurity centers in an otherwise metallic chain , then they will follow a power law behavior predicted by luttinger liquid theory,@xcite n(r)-n_0 ~a_1 + a_2 , [ powerlaw ] with @xmath26 the distance from the impurity .",
    "this expression can be derived from the asymptotic form of the charge correlations and @xmath27 is the interaction dependent correlation exponent.@xcite numerical studies have verified that fo follow this form for the one - band hubbard and @xmath28-@xmath29 models on chains and ladders@xcite and for the kondo lattice model on chains.@xcite in the following , we will fit our data using eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "the complete fitting procedure is detailed in the appendix .",
    "the key point of this procedure is that we _",
    "simultaneously _ fit the fo starting from the left chain end ( cu site ) and the one which starts from the right chain end ( o site ) .",
    "we start by examining the electron density @xmath30 as a function of the position obtained by dmrg for @xmath31 , @xmath32 , which corresponds to quarter filling , @xmath33 , as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . at this filling",
    ", the density modulation has period of four unit cell spacings for the @xmath0 component .",
    "this period can be clearly seen in the friedel oscillations shown in fig .",
    "[ osc05 ] , ( @xmath36 ) in both cu and o ions , at @xmath37 .",
    "these density oscillations extend appreciably over the whole chain . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the density oscillations on both type of ions present a period of two which corresponds to a @xmath4 wave . also shown",
    "are the oscillations for @xmath39 , close to the crossover between both regimes .    by applying the fitting procedure previously discussed ,",
    "we are able to obtain the mean amplitudes for the @xmath0 and @xmath4 components of the friedel oscillations on cu or on o ions starting at site 1 ( occupied by a cu ion ) , corresponding to an impurity on an o ion , and the one starting at site 64 ( occupied by an o ion ) , corresponding to an impurity on a cu ion .",
    "these mean amplitudes are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ amp_l ] ) and ( [ amp_r ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of the density oscillation close to the ends introduces somewhat large numerical errors so we discarded the first three points near the ends .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ ampn05 ] .",
    "the error bars are about the size of the symbols used . by discarding different number of initial sites of course the amplitudes vary .",
    "however , their crossing point does not change appreciably .",
    "various features can be rapidly appreciated : a larger amplitude on o sites than on cu sites for the dominant component ; the suppression of the @xmath0 amplitude with increasing @xmath34 for o - site oscillations ; larger ( smaller ) o ( cu ) amplitudes for cu - impurity than for o - impurity .",
    "the crossing of these mean amplitudes as @xmath35 is increased for a given value of @xmath34 is adopted as the crossing of the @xmath0-dominated regime to the @xmath4-dominated regime .",
    "other criteria could be eventually adopted but we found that this criterion faithfully reproduces the change of oscillation period which is the quantity measured in stm experiments .",
    "the results can be summarized in the  phase \" diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phdiag_quar ] .",
    "the region of @xmath35 below the crossover corresponds to the @xmath0-dominated regime while the region of @xmath35 above it corresponds to the @xmath4-dominated regime .",
    "the first remarkable feature is that the crossover in the o - ions oscillations takes place at lower values of @xmath35 than the crossover in the cu - ions oscillations .    to help the interpretation of these results",
    ", we have overimposed on this figure lines of constant @xmath40 of an effective one - band @xmath28-@xmath29 model with,@xcite j = ( + ) and t_eff ~ we have fixed the proportionality constant in such a way that the physical point for the cuo chains corresponds to @xmath41 , taking into account some dispersion on the values reported for the coulomb interactions which are approximately , @xmath42 ( the value adopted in the present study ) , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( in units of @xmath45 ) . at a fixed hole density , each line of constant @xmath40 ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ phdiag_quar ] ) corresponds in the effective 1d @xmath28-@xmath29 model to a line of constant @xmath46 , which have been previously estimated.@xcite then , it can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ phdiag_quar ] that the @xmath47/@xmath48 boundaries are roughly parallel to these lines with the largest deviation corresponding to the o oscillations , cu impurity .",
    "in addition , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ phdiag_quar](a ) , for the physical region corresponding to the cuo chains ( indicated with a gray circle ) , the fo generated by oxygen depletion have @xmath47 modulation in agreement to experimental results near quarter filling.@xcite in the case of cu impurity ( fig .",
    "[ phdiag_quar](b ) ) , although the @xmath47/@xmath48 boundary is shifted to lower values of @xmath35 , the fo are predicted to have also a @xmath47 character in the physical region .      while in the undoped compound ,",
    "yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath50 , the chain filling is @xmath33 , upon oxygen depletion it increases toward half - filling , which is reached at @xmath51 ( ref .  ) .",
    "hence , in this subsection we consider the case of @xmath49 .",
    "although increased o depletion would produce on average shorter cuo segments , in order to reduce the number of varying parameters and to facilitate the comparison , we study the same chain length as in the previous subsection , i.e. @xmath31 . the filling @xmath49 then corresponds to @xmath52 holes . in this case ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "let us start by examining in real space density oscillations corresponding to this filling .",
    "they are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ osc0875 ] .",
    "the oscillations for small @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath47 can be regarded as period 2 oscillations with kinks , while the oscillations at large @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath48 have a well defined period 8 unit cell spacings .    as we did in the previous subsection ,",
    "we have fitted the density oscillations for both cu and o ions and the results for the mean amplitudes of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 components are shown in fig .",
    "[ ampn0875 ] . by comparing with the previous results at quarter filling",
    ", it can be concluded that the amplitudes of the dominant component are in general much larger in this case of @xmath49 . again",
    "o oscillations have in general larger amplitudes than the cu ones .",
    "it can be also observed that the effect of @xmath34 is relatively small in the present case .",
    "also there are virtually no differences between the cases of o - impurity and cu - impurity .",
    "again , the crossing points between @xmath0 and @xmath4 components of the mean amplitudes lead to the  phase \" diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phdiag_half ] . as anticipated by the previous figure , the boundary between the @xmath0 ( low @xmath35 ) and the @xmath4",
    "( high @xmath35 ) regions has been considerably shifted to lower values of @xmath35 with respect to the quarter filled case .",
    "as for @xmath33 , these boundaries also follow approximately the lines of constant @xmath46 of the effective 1d @xmath28-@xmath29 model .",
    "however , in contrast with that case , there is much less difference between the boundaries for o depletion - induced fo ( fig .",
    "[ phdiag_half](a ) ) and the boundaries for the fo induced by nonmagnetic substitution of cu ions ( fig .",
    "[ phdiag_half](b ) ) . in any case , as in the quarter filled case , the most remarkable feature is again that the @xmath0 to @xmath4 crossover for oxygen fo takes place at smaller values of @xmath35 than the one for cu fo .",
    "notice that for this filling the physical region of parameters ( gray circles ) falls now on the @xmath4 side of the diagram .",
    "finally , by further oxygen depletion , @xmath55 , the chain would formally go into the electron doped region .",
    "the @xmath0/@xmath4 boundary between friedel oscillations on cu ions in the electron doped , @xmath56 , system is also included in fig .  [ phdiag_half ] .",
    "this result confirms the trend suggested by the cases @xmath33 and @xmath49 , that by reducing the number of holes this boundary shifts to lower values of @xmath35 for a fixed @xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "the occupancy on o sites is very low and we observed @xmath0 oscillations for all the values of parameters examined .",
    "it is reasonable to speculate that by further reducing the number of holes the presence of @xmath4 oscillations on cu ions will eventually disappear as well , i.e. the effects of strong electron correlations are expected to be more important close to half - filling .",
    "let us examine some global properties like the total ground state energy @xmath57 and the average amplitude of fo . since this energy is monotonically increasing with @xmath35 , for all the other parameters fixed , it is more meaningful to analyze the quantity obtained by subtracting from @xmath57 the quantity @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the average filling on o sites .",
    "the average of the amplitude of the fo on cu sites is defined as , a_cu= _",
    "i |n(i)-n_cu| [ avampcu ] where the sum runs over cu sites and @xmath60 is the average filling on cu sites . to be consistent with the fitting procedure and hence to allow comparison with figs .",
    "[ ampn05 ] and [ ampn0875 ] we discarded the first three sites close to both chain ends .",
    "the resulting quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ global](a),(b ) for @xmath33 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "it can be noticed that it presents a minimum at a value of @xmath35 close to the @xmath47/@xmath48 boundary of cu fo at a given value of @xmath34 . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ global](c),(d ) , the corrected energy , @xmath61 also presents a minimum at approximately the same values of @xmath35 for @xmath33 . at @xmath49 ,",
    "the minimum of this quantity is located at a lower value , closer to the @xmath47/@xmath48 boundary of oxygen fo .",
    "the two most important results of the present study , which can be deduced from figs .",
    "[ phdiag_quar ] and  [ phdiag_half ] are : ( i ) the @xmath47 to @xmath48 crossover takes place at smaller values of @xmath35 for given @xmath34 as doping is reduced from quarter filling to half filling , and ( ii ) for hole doped chains this crossover takes place at smaller @xmath35 for the density oscillations on o ions than for the ones on cu ions .",
    "let us discuss these two features in detail .    in the first place ,",
    "the fact that the @xmath47/@xmath48 boundaries quite likely correspond to lines of constant @xmath46 of an effective 1d @xmath28-@xmath29 model suggests that both the approximate mapping to this model and the whole fitting procedure are physically correct .",
    "one should notice that this effective one band model is obtained essentially by projecting out the oxygen sites , i.e. is a model valid mostly for cu ions .",
    "besides , it becomes less valid as one moves away from half filling .",
    "it is not obvious then that also the boundaries for oxygen oscillations follow approximately the lines of constant @xmath40 although with some important deviations , specially at quarter filling .",
    "the dependence of @xmath46 with @xmath62 and hole density for the 1d @xmath28-@xmath29 model@xcite , is consistent with the shifting of the cu @xmath47/@xmath48 boundary to lower values of @xmath35 as hole density @xmath63 , and in turn this is consistent with the intuitive notion that strongly correlated electrons regimes become more important close to half - filling .",
    "however , this mapping does not explain by itself why in the case of hole doping , the @xmath47/@xmath48 boundaries for o oscillation occur at smaller values of @xmath35 for any given @xmath34 , i.e. why the o - subsystem enters in the strong correlation regime at smaller interactions than the cu - subsystem . to understand this feature ,",
    "it would be necessary to analyze effective models obtained by projecting out cu sites and retaining o sites .",
    "these effective models , the so - called  spin - fermion \" or kondo - heisenberg models,@xcite are considerably more complicated and related available results are limited.@xcite for hole doped cuprates , i.e. with holes in excess of the number of cu ions , it can be assumed that cu ions are mostly single occupied , and in this case our results suggest that the @xmath47 to @xmath48 crossover is  driven \" by the oxygen oscillations . that is , the o subsystem is more susceptible to strong correlations than the cu subsystem . on the other hand , for the case of electron doped chains ,",
    "i.e. with fewer holes than cu ions , the @xmath47 to @xmath48 crossover takes place at small @xmath35 for cu density oscillations while for o fo have @xmath47 in the range of parameters studied , and in this sense , the crossover seems  driven \" by the cu ions .",
    "hence , the nearly empty o band in electron doped chains is symmetric to the half - filled cu band in hole doped cuprates .",
    "there are two factors affecting the magnitude of the mean amplitudes of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 components : their amplitude at the origin , and their power law exponents .",
    "the amplitudes at the origin ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , in eqs .",
    "( [ left ] ) and ( [ right ] ) ) may depend on the formation of bound states between holes and impurities .",
    "with respect to the power law exponents , one could assume that the fo on cu and on o sites are determined by two different @xmath46 since they obey different effective models in addition of having different hole densities .",
    "unfortunately , although the fitting to the oscillations using eqs .",
    "( [ left ] ) , ( [ right ] ) , ( [ sum ] ) are very good , the determination of @xmath46 from the fitted values is very noisy to allow reliable conclusions . in this sense ,",
    "an independent study of _ periodic _ chains , with a careful study of finite size effects , would be necessary to confirm this possibility .",
    "_ order of the crossover_. it seems to be a first order in the sense that there are no other oscillation wavenumber between @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the evidence for this is rather indirect since our method of fitting does not make room for variable wavenumber , and a fourier ( or windowed fourier ) transform would mix the friedel oscillations starting form the left and right ends of the open chain .",
    "the indication of a first order type of crossover comes from the fact that the overall average amplitude of the density oscillations are minimum at the crossing point ( figs .",
    "[ osc05 ] ,  [ osc0875 ] and  [ global](a),(b ) ) .",
    "this suggests that the system becomes  frustrated \" at the crossing point due to the competition of @xmath47 and @xmath48 modulations being unable to develop a modulation at another wavenumber .",
    "the behavior of the corrected ground state energy , @xmath68 , ( fig .  [ global](c),(d ) ) is consistent with this interpretation : its minimum is located close to the point where @xmath69 is also minimum presumably because it gains energy due to delocalization .",
    "hence , this quantity also suggests that there are no fo with a modulation intermediate between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "_ predictions_. the main prediction of the present study is that cuo chains in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 would undergo a @xmath47 to @xmath48 crossover in the friedel oscillations induced by oxygen depletion or by nonmagnetic substitution of cu ions as doping moves from quarter to half filling and eventually into the electron doped region .",
    "additionally we predict that experiments like stm , probing o sites , would detect a @xmath48 modulation while experiments such as neutron scattering would still see a @xmath47 modulation on cu sites .",
    "more generally , the modulation of fo can be considered as a sensible tool to detect the sometimes subtle presence of strong electron correlations in quasi-1d systems . finally ,",
    "if the observed modulations in cuo chains are essentially friedel oscillations and the presence of superconductivity on the planes plays a minor role , then similar modulations should be observed in the non - superconducting compound prba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath70 ( ref .  ) .",

    "in general , the oscillation starting from the cu - edge is different to that from the o - edge .",
