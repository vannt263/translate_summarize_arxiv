    "the spectroscopic binary system hr  6902 ( g9  iib + b8 - 9  v ) belongs to the category of @xmath8  aur stars , where a hot companion ( generally a main sequence b  star ) moves through the extended envelope of an evolved late - type star .",
    "the specific binary geometry provides an exceptional opportunity to probe the spatial dependence of the physical properties of the outer atmosphere and wind of the primary .",
    "observations of @xmath8  aur systems and related objects with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) and more recently with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) take advantage of the ultraviolet spectral region . at wavelengths below @xmath9 the hot",
    "secondary dominates the observed flux allowing a separation of the spectral information . in the uv",
    "the observed spectrum is purely that of the companion with superimposed circumstellar and interstellar lines .",
    "further information on the binary technique can be found in several reviews ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    ground",
    "based spectroscopic as well as uv and x - ray observations from space of stars in the cool half of the hr diagram have shown that the extended atmospheres of giants and supergiants undergo a dramatic physical change across a region in the hr diagram . to the right of this transition we observe cool and massive winds plus extended cool chromospheres , while to its left there is much hotter circumstellar matter .",
    "this transition is accompanied by different spectral indicators defining distinct dividing lines .",
    "the leftmost is the `` x - ray dividing line '' . all stars to its left show x - ray emission , probably arising from extended corona - like plasma ( e.g. , haisch , schmitt , & rosso 1991 , 1992 ) . in the ultraviolet",
    "the same stars also show and and often emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "additional dividing lines are defined by asymmetries in the and emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite , 1980b ) .",
    "the strongest and most reliable evidence for the existence of a cool , massive wind is the appearance of circumstellar absorption features in the line ( @xcite ) .",
    "a theoretical discussion of the dividing line concept based on hydromagnetic waves can be found in rosner ( 1993 ) and rosner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "however , this simple picture is complicated by the existence of the so - called hybrid stars . hartmann , dupree & raymond ( 1980 ) and reimers ( 1982 ) found that some bright k giants and g supergiants show blue - shifted ( and partly ) absorption and emission lines like and signifying temperatures of at least @xmath10 .",
    "hybrid stars are also x - ray emitters ( @xcite )",
    ". the outflow properties of these stars are still very uncertain and it is controversial whether hybrids show cold ( @xmath11 ) or possibly warm ( @xmath12 ) winds .",
    "previous _ iue _ observations of hr  6902 suggest the existence of warm circumstellar material that may represent the transitional physics of hybrid star atmospheres .",
    "reimers , baade , & schrder ( 1990a ) and reimers et al.(1990b ) have presented a series of _ iue _ high resolution spectra ( @xmath13 ) taken a few days before and after eclipse . and column densities indicate a height - independent electron temperature of @xmath14 . as discussed by reimers et al .",
    "( 1990b ) the density distribution is compatible with a low mass - loss wind .    in the present paper",
    "we report the results of a reanalysis of _ iue _ spectra of hr  6902 . compared to the first study ( @xcite , 1990b ) we utilize a substantially expanded observations database .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",

    "[ sec3 ] summarizes the methodical principles of our absorption analysis technique and the application to the hr  6902 spectra . in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] we outline the multi - dimensional radiative transfer procedure used to infer global properties of the circumstellar shell .",
    "while nearly all observations have been conducted by ourselves in several _ iue _ programs , the data used here are taken from the _ iue _ final archive .",
    "we have compiled a sequence of large aperture spectra obtained between 1987 and 1990 .",
    "full details of the _ newsips _ data reduction have been given by garhart et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and will not be repeated here .",
    "it is , however , worth reiterating that the new processing techniques generally greatly enhance the quality of _ iue _ spectra .",
    "the increase in signal - to - noise improves the detection limit of faint absorption features significantly .",
    "furthermore , the new noise handling allows a reliable error estimate for each point in the flux spectrum .",

    "the mass - loss information is restricted to the ratio @xmath275 .",
    "the winds from hybrid stars show high terminal velocities ( typically 50 to @xmath276 ) as measured by the circumstellar absorption ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the flow velocities of luminous cool stars are always less than the escape speed from the photosphere ( for hr  6902 we find @xmath277 ) .",
    "so we expect @xmath263 to lie in the range @xmath278 .",
    "the corresponding mass - loss rate is @xmath279 with a statistical error of @xmath280 .",

    "this simplification leads to a parker - type wind .",
    "the euler equation can be integrated immediately and yields a solution with a positive velocity gradient at all distances ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath285 = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\rm c}}{r}\\right)^2 \\exp \\left(-\\frac{2r_{\\rm c}}{r } + \\frac{3}{2}\\right).\\ ] ] the transcendental equation can be solved numerically to give @xmath286 .",
    "the critical radius is defined by the singularity of the euler equation : @xmath287 the hydrogen density may be expressed by an equation of the form @xmath288 where the density parameter @xmath289 is related to the mass - loss rate by @xmath290 this formalism suggests varying the density parameter and the critical velocity to model @xmath291 .",
    "the critical velocity specifies the singularity of the momentum equation and thus determines the slope of the resulting density distribution .",
    "we note that there is no need to take explicitly care of specific pressure constituents .",
    "our least square fit procedure yields @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "the density parameter leads to a mass - loss rate of @xmath294 .    using eq .",
    "[ eq-12 ] the critical radius becomes @xmath295 , indicating a high velocity close to the surface of the giant .",
    "[ fig5 ] demonstrates that both wind models lead to similar density laws .",
    "indeed , the approximate relationship between @xmath296 and @xmath4 derived by harper et al .  [ 1995 , eq .",
    "( 10 ) ] yields an acceleration parameter of 0.54 quite similar to the result of our beta - law analysis .",
    "this finding may justify the @xmath4 power - law approach in other red giant winds , where we have an unknown hydrodynamic situation .    assuming the effective pressure to be supplied by both gas and turbulence pressure the critical velocity is given by @xmath297 the best - fit model with @xmath298 yields a turbulence of @xmath299 which exceeds the observed stochastic velocity by a factor of 1.8 .",
    "this discrepancy may become even worse when we allow for macroscopic line broadening .",
    "either the identification of turbulent and stochastic velocity is completely inappropriate , or the momentum eq .",
    "[ eq-10 ] contains unknown external forces or pressure terms .",
    "furthermore , the relation between the observed line broadening velocity and the turbulent velocity is not clear and depends on the driving mechanism(s ) , the geometry , and the statistics of the absorbing structures .    in the preceding analysis",
    "we have ignored line broadening due to the wind velocity . in order to examine the effect on the derived parameters we repeat the absorption line analysis with the complete optical depth quadrature according to eq .",
    "the wind outflow is assumed to be well described by the @xmath4 power - law .",
    "again we consider terminal velocities ranging from 50 to @xmath300 .",
    "it turns out that high velocity models with @xmath301 can not reproduce the observed profile shapes adequately .",
    "the deduced stochastic component of the line broadening lies in the interval @xmath302 showing partly a large standard error .",
    "the range of stochastic velocities reflects both noisy _ iue _ spectra and true irregularities of the local velocity field . as an example we present in table  [ tbl-3 ] the results for @xmath303 which represents the most probable fit model .",
    "though this model yields considerably reduced stochastic velocities with a weighted mean ( i.e. , averaged over all heights ) of @xmath304 , the derived column densities are fairly close to the quasi - static model .",
    "this finding even holds for larger wind speeds and we conclude that the quasi - static analysis has produced column densities with a reasonable degree of confidence .",
    "reimers et al .  ( 1990a ) have shown that the and emission lines are formed by resonance scattering of b star photons in the envelope of the primary .",
    "profile modeling requires the solution of a two - dimensional radiative transfer problem .",
    "the difficulty arises due to the fact that the light source ( i.e. the b star ) is displaced from the center of wind symmetry .",
    "it is well - known that the scattering lines are formed in a large volume compared to the scale of the binary orbit ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the emission line diagnostics allows to study the large - scale properties of the circumstellar envelope .    for the 2-d radiative transfer calculations we employ the sei ( sobolev with exact integration ) method , i.e.",
    ", the source function is approximated using the escape probability formalism followed by an exact formal solution using short characteristics .",
    "this procedure is simple in concept and can be applied to very extended geometrical grids . in normal @xmath8  aur systems",
    "the sobolev approach leads to erroneous results , since the wind velocities are typically only a few times the stochastic velocities .",
    "however , a comparison with a more refined 2-d radiative transfer code ( @xcite , 1990 ) demonstrates the reliability of the sobolev solution in the case of hr  6902 .",
    "the reason is the low mass - loss rate ( @xmath305 ) compared to the `` classical '' @xmath8  aur systems ( @xmath306 ) . as a consequence the line opacities are",
    "small and multiple line photon scattering is of minor importance .      in the framework of",
    "the first order escape probability theory the scattering integral is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath307s({\\bf r})+\\beta_{\\rm c}({\\bf r})i_{\\rm c},\\ ] ] where @xmath308 denotes a constant core intensity representing the b star .",
    "the escape probabilities are given by @xmath309 and @xmath310 with the sobolev optical thickness @xmath311 .",
    "the so - called sobolev length in the direction @xmath312 may be defined in tensor notation : @xmath313 the quantity @xmath314 denotes the probability that a photon emitted at the point @xmath315 escapes from the outer boundary and @xmath316 symbolizes the probability that a photon emitted by the core ( i.e. the b star ) penetrates to the point @xmath317 . in the case of pure resonance scattering the line source function is simply given by @xmath318 detailed information can be found in hempe ( 1982 ) who applied the sobolev formalism to the specific conditions of the binary configuration . with known source function on a two - dimensional grid , we can calculate the emergent radiation field .",
    "the intensities are supplied by the formal solution of the transfer equation and can be integrated along a set of parallel rays through the envelope . in a subsequent step the integration over all solid angles and",
    "normalization yields the residual flux @xmath319 . for a detailed description",
    "we refer to baade ( 1990 ) and kirsch & baade ( 1994 ) .      to calculate synthetic emission lines we extrapolate the wind models derived in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] to the whole envelope assuming the temperature and thus the ionization state to remain fixed .",
    "though this simplistic approach implies spurious energy sources to maintain the temperature it may be sufficient to explain qualitatively the observed flux .    in the first step we use the and line ratio observed during total eclipse to derive the ionization temperature .",
    "unfortunately , the clearly visible line eludes the diagnostic procedure , since the photospheric background profile is not known precisely .",
    "furthermore , the loci of line formation may be quite different .",
    "we calculate a grid of theoretical flux ratios in the temperature range between 60000 and @xmath320 .",
    "the ionization problem is solved using the cloudy code as described in sect .",
    "[ sec32 ] . to consider the influence of different wind velocities we have a closer look at four different models defined either by the @xmath4  power - law or the @xmath5 wind according to sect .",

    "[ fig6 ] the theoretical flux ratios depend only slightly on the specific wind model .",
    "the observed line ratio suggests an electron temperature of @xmath321 consistent with the mean temperature obtained on the basis of the absorption line analysis .",
    "we use the derived electron temperature to calculate integrated line fluxes of the and emission lines .",
    "the observed values ( table  [ tbl-4 ] ) can be reconstructed using the parameters @xmath322 @xmath271 for the @xmath4  power - law and @xmath323 @xmath271 for the @xmath5 wind model . in both cases",
    "the density parameter differs only by a factor of @xmath324 from the results of the absorption line analysis .",
    "the discrepancy may be a result of the inadmissible extrapolation of the isothermal density distribution .",
    "indeed , we would expect a decreasing temperature at large distances from the giant causing a reduced absorber density .",

    "however , the low resolution _ iue _ spectra ( @xmath331 ) does not allow to examine these effects more closely . to demonstrate the expected situation we present in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] a selection of theoretical flux profiles .",
    "it is obvious that the asymptotic flow velocity determines the character of the line profiles . in combination with a semi - empirical density model the line positions and profile shapes give reliable information about the global wind structure",
    "this allows us to predict that high - resolution uv observations will unravel the kinematic nature of the circumstellar envelope of hr  6902 .",
    "in the present paper we have analyzed _ iue _ observations of the @xmath8  aurigae type binary system hr  6902 . the hot secondary serves as a convenient probe for the extended envelope of the bright giant . by means of a least square profile - fit procedure",
    "we have deduced and column densities and stochastic velocities .",
    "the density distribution of the inner envelope ( @xmath332 ) can be described by a quasi hydrostatic model .",
    "we have shown that pressure support by turbulence is sufficient to explain the empirical scale height . however , in order to match the empirical column densities adequately we had to introduce an appropriate outflow model .",
    "we have demonstrated that both the common @xmath4  power - law and a @xmath5 wind yield appropriate density distributions and explain the absence of and absorption at larger distances from the giant .",
    "[ fig8 ] demonstrates that the hydrostatic solution as well as the different outflow models lead to similar density laws . despite this similarity",
    "the hydrodynamic implications are completely different .",
    "the required driving force per unit mass @xmath282 should be compared to theoretical models .",
    "we have derived mass - loss rates in the range @xmath333 .",
    "this result indicates that the mass - loss rate of hr  6902 scales roughly with the solar mass flux , i.e. , @xmath334 .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that the emission line spectrum obtained during total eclipse confirms essentially the wind models derived from the absorption line analysis .",
    "this finding supports the picture of a steady and spherically symmetric flow without excessive deviations from the mean wind model .",
    "it is shown that hr  6902 possesses warm ( @xmath335 ) circumstellar material , observed in a range of impact parameters between 1.1 and @xmath336 .",
    "recently , the innermost region immediately above the photosphere ( @xmath337 ) has been examined by schrder , marshall , & griffin ( 1996 ) using optical spectra .",
    "they derived a temperature of @xmath338 and a turbulent velocity of @xmath339 .",
    "however , in order to fit the k - line wing they postulated a second absorption component with a considerably larger turbulent velocity of @xmath340 quite similar to the stochastic velocities derived in the present work . combining these results we suspect a dramatic change of the physical conditions in the giant s atmosphere at @xmath341 associated with a steep rise of the temperature from about 5000 to @xmath342 .    the large nonthermal line broadening parameter and its relative constancy ( apart from local fluctuations ) may be a characteristic property of the wind of hr  6902 .",
    "the simplistic identification of turbulence and the observed stochastic velocity can not explain the large pressure required to explain the density distribution by a @xmath5 wind .",
    "however , the true relation between the observed line width and turbulent motions associated with wave - driven winds depends on the specific driving mechanism , geometrical details , and the randomness of the absorbing structures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the wind models suggest a rapid wind acceleration within @xmath343 above the photosphere .",
    "this result is similar to the outflow characteristics of hybrid stars [ @xmath344  aqr ( g2 ib ) , @xmath4  aqr ( g0 ib ) , @xmath345  her ( k1 iia ) , @xmath346  aur ( k3 ii ) , @xmath347  aql ( k 3ii ) , and @xmath344  tra ( k3 ii ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "furthermore , a recent analysis of _ orfeus  ii _ spectra of the hybrid stars @xmath344  tra and @xmath344  aqr ( @xcite ) have revealed that the stellar winds are not confined to cool circumstellar material .",
    "they pointed out that ions like through indicate expanding material up to a temperature of @xmath348 with wind velocities from 100 to @xmath349 .",
    "we argue that the wind properties of hybrid stars are comparable to the extended atmosphere of hr  6902 .    with its location in the hr diagram",
