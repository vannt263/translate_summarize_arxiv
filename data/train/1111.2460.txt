    "accretion onto a supersonically moving star is an important astrophysical process which has been studied theoretically and with simulations over many years ( review by edgar 2004 ) .",
    "this type of accretion has applications in many areas .",
    "for example , the accretion by a compact star in a binary system where the gas supply is from a stellar wind or from a common envelope ( petterson 1978 ; taam and sandquist 2000 ) ; and flows in regions of star formation ( bonnell et al .",
    "2001 ; edgar and clarke 2004 ) .    supersonic accretion of a pressureless fluid onto a gravitating center was investigated analytically by hoyle and lyttleton ( 1939 ) and an analytic solution was found by bisnovatyi - kogan et al .",
    "later , bondi and hoyle ( 1944 ) developed a model including the fluid pressure .",
    "the bondi - hoyle model gives an explicit prediction for the accretion rate .",
    "supersonic accretion has been studied using numerical hydrodynamic simulations by ruffert ( ruffert , 1994a ; ruffert and arnett , 1994 ; ruffert , 1994b ) .",
    "he studied the flow of gas past an accretor of varying sizes . for small accretors ,",
    "the accretion rates obtained were in broad agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "accretion of matter to a nonmagnetized gravitating center was investigated by bisnovatyi - kogan & pogorelov ( 1997 ) .",
    "pogorelov , ohsugi , & matsuda ( 2000 ) studied the bondi - hoyle accretion flow and its dependence on parameters but also for a nonmagnetized center .    here",
    ", we investigate bondi - hoyle accretion to magnetized stars in application to the accretion of the interstellar medium ( ism ) onto isolated old neutron stars ( ions ) .",
    "these slowly rotating neutron stars may be visible due accretion of the interstellar medium .",
    "these stars may have dynamically important magnetic fields .",
    "we use axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics simulations to model the accretion onto the star .",
    "earlier , we investigated cases of supersonic motion of _ strongly _ magnetized stars through the ism in cases of slow rotation ( toropina at all 2001 ; hereafter t01 ) and fast rotation in the _ propeller _ regime ( toropina , romanova , lovelace 2006 ; hereafter t06 ) . in these cases",
    "the magnetospheric radius is greater then accretion radius @xmath3 and gravitational focusing is not important .",
    "both cases correspond to magnetars with magnetic field @xmath4 g.        the present simulations are analogous to those in t01 and t06 . however , here the star has a more typical neutron star magnetic field , @xmath5 g. the magnetospheric radius is less then the accretion radius and gravitational focusing is important .",
    "a star gathers matter from the region inside the accretion radius .",
    "sections 2 and 3 describe the physical situation and simulation model . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the results of our simulations . in sec .",
    "5 we apply our results to more realistic neutron stars .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "a non - magnetized star moving through the ism captures matter gravitationally from the accretion or bondi - hoyle radius @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the normalized velocity of the star , @xmath8 the sound speed of the undisturbed ism , and @xmath9 is the normalized mass of the star .",
    "the mass accretion rate at high mach numbers @xmath10 was derived by hoyle and lyttleton ( 1939 ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass - density of the ism and @xmath13 is the normalized number density .",
    "the hoyle - lyttleton model neglects the fluid pressure as mentioned .",
    "later , bondi and hoyle ( 1944 ) extended the analysis to include the pressure .",
    "a more general formula for arbitrary mach numbers @xmath14 was proposed by bondi ( 1952 ) , @xmath15 where the coefficient @xmath16 is of the order of unity .",
    "bondi suggested @xmath17 , but here we assume @xmath18 in agreement with equation ( 2 ) .",
    "values of the @xmath16 parameter for different specific heat ratios are determined by the simulations of pogorelov , ohsugi , & matsuda ( 2000 ) .",
    "a sketch of the geometry for the bondi - hoyle analysis is shown on figure 1 .    if the fast moving star has a significant magnetic field , then the situation is more complex . in the limit of a strong stellar magnetic field ,",
    "the ram pressure of ism can be balanced by the magnetic pressure of the star s magnetosphere at a radius @xmath0 which is larger than @xmath19 . in this limit",
    "the ism interacts directly with the star s `` large '' magnetosphere .",
    "this case investigated earlier by t01 is relevant to stars with very strong magnetic fields ( e.g. , magnetars ) or to stars with very high velocity .    in the opposite limit where @xmath20",
    "the situation is different .",
    "first , matter is captured by the gravitational field of the star as in bondi - hoyle accretion onto a non - magnetized star and it accumulates .",
    "if the magnetosphere of the star is very small , @xmath21 , and the gravitationally attracted matter accretes to the star in a spherically symmetric flow , then @xmath22 ( e.g. , lipunov 1992 ) , where @xmath23 is the magnetic field at the surface of the star of radius @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the accretion rate .    if the magnetized star accretes matter with the same rate as a non - magnetized star , @xmath26 , then the magnetospheric radius is @xmath27 from equation ( 4 ) with @xmath28 g and @xmath29 cm . for the adopted reference parameters ,",
    "@xmath0 is roughly equal to @xmath30 .",
    "our simulations discussed below show that the accretion rate to the star is in general _ less _ than @xmath31 .    our earlier studies of accretion onto magnetized stars ( toropina at al .",
    "2001 ; romanova at al . 2003",
    "; toropina at al .",
    "2003 ) showed that the magnetosphere acts as an obstacle for the flow and that the star accretes at a _ lower _ rate than a non - magnetized star for the same @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in all those simulations we considered strongly magnetized stars including magnetars .    in this work",
    "we consider stars with magnetic fields @xmath34 g , and investigate its interaction with the interstellar medium .",
    "we neglect rotation of the star .",
    "we investigate the interaction of fast moving magnetized star with the ism using an axisymmetric , resistive mhd code .",
    "the code incorporates the methods of local iterations and flux - corrected - transport developed by zhukov , zabrodin , & feodoritova ( 1993 ) .",
    "this code was used in our earlier simulations of bondi accretion onto a magnetized star ( toropin at .",
    "al . 1999 , hereafter t99 ) ,",
    "propagation of a magnetized star through the ism ( t01 ) , spherical accretion to a star in the  propeller \" regime ( romanova at al .",

    "the flow is described by the resistive mhd equations : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38",
    "we assume axisymmetry @xmath39 , but calculate all three components of velocity and magnetic field @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "the associated magnetic diffusivity , @xmath47 , is considered to be a constant within the computational region . in equation",
    "( 2 ) the gravitational force , @xmath48 , is due to the star because the self - gravity of the accreting gas is negligible .",
    "we use a cylindrical , inertial coordinate system @xmath49 with the @xmath50axis parallel to the star s dipole moment @xmath51 and rotation axis @xmath52 .",
    "the vector potential @xmath53 is calculated so that automatically @xmath54 at all times .",

    "the intrinsic magnetic field of the star is taken to be an aligned dipole , with vector potential @xmath56 .",
    "we measure length in units of the bondi radius @xmath57 , with @xmath8 the sound speed at infinity , the density in units of the density of the interstellar medium at infinity , @xmath12 , and the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath58 which is the field at the pole of the numerical star . here",
    "we use the term numerical star to distinguish the model star ( inner boundary ) from the actual neutron star .",
    "the magnetic moment is measured in units of @xmath59 .",
    "after reduction to dimensionless form , the mhd equations involve the dimensionless parameters : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the dimensionless magnetic diffusivity , @xmath62 is the magnetic reynolds number , and @xmath63 is the ratio of the ism pressure at infinity @xmath64 and the magnetic pressure at the poles of the numerical star .",
    "simulations were done in a cylindrical region @xmath65 .",
    "the numerical star was represented by a small cylindrical box with dimensions @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "a uniform @xmath68 grid with @xmath69 cells was used .",
    "initially , the density @xmath70 and the velocity @xmath71 are taken to be constant in the region @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",

    "the size of the computational region for most of the simulations was @xmath86 , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 in units of the bondi radius . the theoretically derived accretion radius ( bondi - hoyle radius ) @xmath89 .",
    "therefore the size of the computational region is sufficient for our simulations .",
    "the grid @xmath69 was @xmath90 in most of cases .",
    "the radius of the numerical star was @xmath91 in all cases .",
    "we consider bondi - hoyle accretion onto a star with a small magnetosphere .",
    "simulations were done for a number of values of the star s magnetic moments @xmath92 .",
    "the numerical star ( inner boundary ) is typically much larger than the true radius of the neutron star .",
    "thus the actual star is `` hidden '' inside the numerical star .",
    "the mach number for all of the present simulations is @xmath93 .",
    "also , @xmath94 , which corresponds to the magnetic moment @xmath95g@xmath96 .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity is @xmath97 .",
    "we measure time in units of @xmath98 , which is the crossing time of the computational region with the star s velocity , @xmath99 .              to test our model we performed hydrodynamic simulations of the bondi - hoyle accretion to a _ non - magnetized _ star for mach number @xmath93 .",
    "dimensionless accretion radius for this parameter @xmath89 .",
    "the star collects matter from inside this radius .",
    "we verified that the flow is close to that described earlier in t01 where matter forms a conical shock wave .",
    "figure 2 shows the main features of the flow at a late time @xmath100 when the flow is stationary .",
    "we calculated the accretion rate @xmath101 to the numerical star and got a value @xmath102 for numerical star @xmath91 were @xmath31 is the bondi - hoyle accretion rate of equation ( 3 ) with @xmath103 . in our earlier calculation",
    "we got a slightly smaller value , @xmath104 for a numerical star @xmath105 ( t01 ) .",
    "this difference can be explained by the higher resolution of the present calculations .",
    "and this difference agrees with ruffert s results on the dependence of @xmath101 on numerical star size for the sizes used ( ruffert 1994 ) .",
    "we performed simulations for a number of values of the magnetic moment .",
    "initially we chose @xmath95g@xmath96 ( dimensionless moment @xmath106 ) , which corresponds to a star s surface magnetic field @xmath107 g .",
    "we investigated this case in detail .",
    "figure 3 shows the main features of the flow . because of the magnetospheric radius @xmath108",
    ", the gravitational focusing is important and the star gathers matter from the region inside the accretion radius @xmath109 , which corresponds approximately to the theoretically derived accretion radius ( bondi - hoyle radius ) @xmath89 .",
    "the magnetospheric radius @xmath110 is about @xmath111 times smaller than the gravitational radius @xmath1 . at the same time the average magnetospheric radius @xmath0 is about @xmath112 times larger than the numerical star radius @xmath91 . the star s magnetic field at distances @xmath113 is significantly affected by the matter flow .",
    "an excess of matter flows from the backside of the star ( return flow ) and consequently the magnetic field lines are pushed towards the `` front '' of the star forming `` ear''-like shapes .",
    "the  ears \" oscillate in the @xmath50direction .",
    "the conical shock wave is close to that found in the hydrodynamic case which is expected since the mach numbers are the same .",
    "figure 4 shows zoomed - in view of the stellar magnetic which is deformed by the flow at a late time @xmath114 .",
    "the thick black line surrounding the star is the magnetospheric radius @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependences of the density , velocity and temperature along the @xmath50axis . there is a normal shock wave at @xmath117 .",
    "the density increases as the star is approached ; and it is zero in the region of the star where matter is accreted . behind the star ( @xmath118 ) there is a strong density enhancement owing to the gravitational focusing . at @xmath119 the density of matter behind",
    "the star is significantly larger than the density on the front side .",
    "the velocity @xmath120 decreases sharply in the shock wave to subsonic values , but later increases again in the polar column . behind the star the velocity is negative in the region , where accretion occurs and also increases again in the polar column to supersonic values .",
    "the plasma temperature @xmath121 and pressure @xmath122 increase strongly approaching the star along the @xmath123 directions .",
    "this is due to the adiabatic compression of the matter .",
    "figure 6 shows the variation of the plasma pressure @xmath122 , magnetic pressure @xmath124 and @xmath125 along the @xmath50axis .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the initial distributions .",
    "one can see that the pressure @xmath122 gradually increases along @xmath50axis , has a maximum in polar columns , and then gradually decreases .",
    "the magnetic pressure @xmath124 initially has a dipole shape , but it is significantly modified by the inflow of matter . outside of the magnetosphere the matter pressure dominates .",
    "we performed a number of simulation runs with different dimensionless magnetic moments ranging from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "for relatively small magnetic moments , @xmath128 , we observed oscillations of the magnetic field configuration as shown in figure 7 for our main case where @xmath129 .",
    "these oscillations are connected with the balance between back flow of the accreting matter and the tension in the distorted stellar magnetic field .",
    "figure 7 illustrates time evolution of magnetic field lines .",
    "the field oscillations are accompanied by strong oscillations in the accretion rate to the star as shown in the top panel of figure 8 for our main case where @xmath130 . for larger values of @xmath92 the oscillations",
    "are much weaker as shown in the bottom panel of figure 8 .",
    "a fourier analysis of the accretion rate oscillations for our main case gives the quasi - period of these oscillations @xmath131 .",
    "note that in hydrodynamic simulations ruffert ( 1994b , 1996 ) observed a `` flip - flop '' instability of the accretion flow in 2d simulations and mass accretion rate fluctuation for smaller accretors in 3d simulations . in our simulations",
    "we see instability of the flow in case of weak or moderate magnetic field .",
    "this instability disappears as the magnetic field increases .",
    "further , this instability is absent in our purely hydrodynamic simulation with the same parameters .              for our main case",
    "the mass accretion rate is approximately @xmath132 .",
    "this value is smaller than mass accretion rate in the hydrodynamic case with the same parameters @xmath133 .",
    "hence even a small stellar magnetic field acts to reduce the mass accretion rate .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions of our earlier work ( t99 , t03 ) .",
    "figure 9 shows the observed dependence of the accretion rate on the star s magnetic moment .",
    "it is approximately @xmath134 .",
    "note however that as @xmath92 increases , the magnetospheric radius @xmath0 can approach the accretion radius @xmath1 and this can suppress the accretion .",
    "let us consider an isolated old neutron star ( ions ) moving through the interstellar medium .",
    "the star is magnetized and has a mass @xmath135 .",
    "the density of the interstellar matter is assumed to be @xmath136  g@xmath137@xmath96 ( @xmath138  @xmath139 ) .",
    "the sound speed in the ism is assumed to be @xmath140km / s so that at a mach number @xmath93 the star moves with a velocity @xmath141 km / s which corresponds to a relatively slow moving neutron star ( arzoumanian , chernoff , & cordes 2002 ) .",
    "the bondi - hoyle radius is @xmath142 the bondi - hoyle accretion rate is the @xmath143/yr for a non - magnetized star .",
    "this gives an accretion energy release rate of @xmath144erg / s for @xmath145 cm and a non - rotating star .",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath146 are reduced for magnetized star as as shown in figure 10 . with @xmath147 and @xmath148",
    ", we obtain the magnetic field at the surface of the numerical star @xmath149 g .",
    "recall that the size of the numerical star is @xmath150 in all simulations .",
    "thus the magnetic moment of the numerical star is @xmath151 g@xmath96 .",
    "note that this is of the order of the magnetic moment of typical spin powered radio pulsars which have a surface field @xmath152 g and radius of the order of @xmath153 cm .",
    "thus we can suggest that an actual neutron star exists inside of our numerical star .",
    "we can estimate the radius of the magnetosphere using equation ( 5 ) as @xmath154 .",
    "thus @xmath108 .",
    "we carried out axisymmetric mhd simulations of bondi - hoyle accretion onto a fast moving neutron star ( @xmath93 ) with an aligned dipole magnetic field for cases where the bondi - hoyle accretion radius @xmath1 is much larger than the star s magnetospheric radius @xmath0 . from this",
    "we conclude that :    1 .",
    "interstellar matter is captured by the star if it has an impact parameter less than the accretion radius @xmath1 .",
    "it then falls onto the star mainly onto the magnetic poles of the star .",
    "more matter falls downstream of the star",
    ". the accretion rate to the star is smaller than that to a non - magnetized star .    2 .",
    "in case of a strong stellar magnetic field ( @xmath155 ) the field is stretched in the direction of the dominant flow which towards the front side of the star .    in the case of a weak magnetic field ( @xmath156 ) ,",
    "the star s field oscillates in the front / back direction .",
    "these oscillations are accompanied by strong oscillations of the mass accretion rate .",
    "the time scales of the oscillations is @xmath157 .",
    "the accretion rate decreases with increasing magnetic moment approximately as @xmath158 .",
    "old slowly rotating neutron stars with no radio emission may be visible in the x - ray band due to accretion of interstellar matter . for a neutron star moving through the interstellar medium with mach number of @xmath112 we estimate the accretion luminosity as @xmath159erg s@xmath160 .",
    "in general , the star s velocity , magnetic moment , and angular velocity vectors may all be in different directions so that the accretion luminosity will be modulated at the star s rotation rate .",
