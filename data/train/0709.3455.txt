    "there has been remarkable evidence found in the last few years that the evolution of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and galaxies are inextricably linked . for instance , ultraluminous infrared and submillimeter galaxies @xcite , with prodigious rates of star formation , show a high fraction of agn activity .",
    "current models of galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this self - regulated growth may then establish the correlation between the mass of the central black hole and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host bulge @xcite .",
    "a clear imprint of this scenario may be evident in the properties ( e.g. , color and morphology ) of the host galaxies of agn caught at early epochs in their evolution .",

    "surveys of obscured agn , selected through various means ( e.g. , optical emission lines , x - rays , or reradiated infrared emission ) , offer the potential to measure cleanly the ages , stellar populations , and star - formation rates of these host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite clearly show that the hosts of narrow emission line agn ( @xmath20 ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are predominately massive , early - type galaxies and that those with the most - luminous agn have significant star formation with younger mean stellar ages .",

    "the prevalence of agn host galaxies within the region separating the blue and red galaxy populations may lend support for the importance of agn feedback since this location is thought to represent a transitional phase in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is of much interest to constrain observationally whether environment plays a significant role in the growth of smbhs as expected by merger - driven accretion models .",

    "there is also evidence that larger scale ( @xmath260.1  mpc ) structures may play an important role in agn fueling .",
    "@xcite have measured the cross - correlation function of narrow - line agn in the sdss with a well - controlled sample of non - active galaxies , and find that agn are primarily not associated with major mergers of galaxies , and preferentially lie within the densest peaks of the underlying dark - matter distribution .",
