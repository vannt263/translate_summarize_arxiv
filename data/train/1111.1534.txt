    "during the last two decades there has been much interest in using the electron spin in electronic devices .",

    "the structural asymmetry of the confining potential in heterostructures gives rise to the so called rashba term@xcite .",
    "the rashba interaction has practical advantages in that it depends on the electronic environment of the heterostructure which can be modified in sample fabrication and in - situ by gate voltages@xcite .",
    "this results in the possibility of varying the spin - orbit interaction on the nanometer scale .",
    "interestingly , even structurally symmetric heterostructures can present spin - orbit interaction provided that coupling between subbands of distinct parities is allowed@xcite .",

    "the energy bands clearly show band gaps that are renormalized by the rashba interaction .",

    "the location of the band gaps are at the crossing of energy bands from adjacent brillouin zones .",
    "these energy bands can be calculated via an analytical approximation scheme@xcite .",
    "using non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) and the landauer formalism we calculate the charge conductance through a finite region containing both a periodic potential and the rashba interaction . in the conductance",

    "a more realistic case would be if there were some fluctuations in the potential . to verify the robustness of the results in the previous section we rerun the simulations with a non - ideal periodic potential .",
    "this is done by introducing a @xmath146 gaussian error in both the height and length of each potential hill created by the fingergates .",
    "figure  [ fig : gausserror ] ( b ) shows that extra noise is added to our conductance result ; still the trajectories of the conductance dips are fairly visible . to counter against the noise introduced by fluctuations we could add extra periods to the periodic potential .",
    "this helps averaging out the noise , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gausserror ] ( a ) where we have quadrupled the length of the wire and the number of fingergates . this ( self)averaging is however slow and requires a large number of fingergates .",

    "we find that the energy gaps resulting from the periodic potential split up and shift from the bragg plane due to the rashba spin - orbit interaction . above a certain spin - orbit strength some of the new energy gaps shift linearly in energy as a function of the rashba spin - orbit strength .",
    "we propose that this effect can be used to measure the change in the rashba spin - orbit strength , e. g. resulting from a voltage gate@xcite .",

    "we used eq .",

    "an easier way is to linearize the @xmath150 and @xmath151 functions around the point @xmath152 .",
    "this approximation introduces little errors and allows us to write the crossing point as @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155    the trajectories of the crossing points across the energy - rashba spin - orbit coupling surface are then @xmath156 or @xmath157 .",

    "the @xmath28 value of the crossing point between the @xmath76 and @xmath77 bands remains almost constant as a function of @xmath6 .",
