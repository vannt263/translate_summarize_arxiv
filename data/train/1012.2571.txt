    "neutrino physics can anticipate an era of higher precision measurements with the upcoming generation of neutrino experiments . in the past",
    ", measurements have shown that the mixing pattern of lepton sector is quite different from that of quark sector . in the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) parameterization @xcite for lepton mixing",
    "there are two large mixing angles .",
    "the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath1 is almost maximal while the solar mixing angle @xmath2 is also large and the reactor mixing angle @xmath3 nearly vanishes .",
    "the recent results are summarized in table[tab : data ] .",
    "we can see that the uncertainties in mixing angles are not particularly small . in most measurements",
    "there is roughly a @xmath4 deviation at @xmath5 confidence level .",

    "@xmath33 is the dirac phase and we have neglected majorana phases . from table",
    "i we see that a good first approximation is to take @xmath34 which gives @xmath35 using this as a starting point , we wish to investigate whether there is an underlying symmetry @xmath36 of the neutrino mass matrix",
    ". this matrix must satisfy @xmath37=0 $ ] , or @xmath38 . given a @xmath36",
    ", the transformation @xmath39 also diagonalizes @xmath40 . but",
    "@xmath41 is unique except for phases .",
    "this can be seen by supposing that @xmath42 is a unitary matrix such that @xmath43 also diagonalizes @xmath40 . for this to be true",
    ", @xmath42 must satisfy @xmath44 and this implies that @xmath45 . since @xmath39 diagonalizes @xmath40 , it must have the form @xmath46 , where @xmath42 has @xmath47 or @xmath48 diagonal elements .",
    "thus @xmath49 there are only eight possible combinations for the elements of @xmath42 .",
    "two of these are the unit matrix and its negative , both of which define @xmath36 as a multiple of the identity . of the remaining six , three have two entries of @xmath50 and one of @xmath48 , while the other three have two entries of @xmath48 and one of @xmath50 .",
    "these diagonal matrices differ by an overall minus sign , so only one of the two types is independent . if we choose the three with one entry of @xmath47 and two entries of @xmath48 ( @xmath51 ) , then it is easy to see that multiplying any pair of these diagonal matrices will result in the remaining matrix .",
    "hence , in reality , only two of these matrices are independent and both represent a @xmath52 symmetry . since the independent @xmath36 s commute , the horizontal symmetry of lepton mixing is @xmath53 if neutrinos are majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "a representation of @xmath36 can be obtained using @xmath54 since the eigenvalue @xmath47 can occur in three places , there are three symmetry matrices @xmath36 @xmath55 and @xmath56 where the subscript @xmath57 on @xmath58 denotes the component of @xmath59 that is @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath60 gives @xmath61 symmetry  @xcite while @xmath62 is symmetric and commutes with @xmath60 .",
    "for simplicity we can parameterize the solar mixing angle @xmath63 as @xmath64 then the mixing matrix ( [ eq : unus ] ) takes the form @xcite @xmath65 consequently , the symmetry transformation matrix @xmath66 can be reexpressed in terms of @xmath67 @xmath68    although we can  derive \" a generalized form of @xmath62 symmetry transformation matrix ( [ g1 ] ) given the mixing matrix ( [ eq : uk ] ) , this relationship can not be reversed .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath41 can not be uniquely determined solely by @xmath62 due to the fact that @xmath62 has degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "invariance under @xmath60 requires @xmath69 , @xmath70 , but invariance under @xmath62 does not , so below we assume that the neutrino mass matrix is invariant under @xmath62 , not only in the approximation @xmath71 , but for general values of all the mixing angles . in the next section we use this assumption in the form of eq.([g1 ] ) with general values of @xmath67 to derive relations among the mixing angles . in sec.3",
    "we compare our results with the experimental values and in sec.4 we summarize .",
    "in this section we show explicitly the consequences of generalized @xmath62 symmetry .",
    "only two mass square differences have been measured and the neutrino s mass scale has not been determined by experiments .",
    "it is possible that one of the mass eigenvalues vanishes .",
    "this is also theoretically motivated by minimal seesaw model @xcite .",
    "we will explore the joint consequences of one vanishing mass eigenvalue and @xmath62 invariance . for simplicity we will postpone discussion of @xmath72 phases to a later article @xcite .",
    "if the neutrinos are majorana fermions , their mass matrix must be symmetric .",
    "we will consider the case that there are three generations of light neutrinos .",
    "then , the most general form of the neutrino mass matrix can be parameterized as    @xmath73    which has six independent matrix elements .",
    "we assume @xmath28 is invariant under the @xmath62 symmetry transformation , @xmath74 with the help of ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ m ] ) , eq.([gmg ] ) gives two conditions on the neutrino mass matrix elements of ( [ m ] ) @xcite ,    @xmath75    [ bcdak ]      if there is a vanishing mass eigenvalue @xmath76 the corresponding mass eigenstate , which can be denoted as @xmath77 , must satisfy    @xmath78    if we assume @xmath79 then we get three equations    @xmath80    [ eq:0mass ]    where @xmath81 .",
    "thus we have two sets of conditions , ( [ bcdak ] ) from @xmath62 invariance , and ( [ eq:0mass ] ) from the vanishing mass eigenvalue .    from the relations ( [ eq:0mass ] ) we can express the matrix element @xmath82 in terms of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86",
    "now let us use these in the @xmath0 relations .",

    "consequently @xmath93 given above would also be zero .",
    "since the experimental data shows that two mass square differences between the three neutrino mass eigenvalues are nonzero , we need at least two masses nonzero in order to have two oscillation lengths .",
    "a second solution of ( [ c2d ] ) , ( [ c1d ] ) is @xmath94 but then the three relations in ( [ eq:0mass ] ) simply reproduce the conditions ( [ bcdak ] ) .",
    "so the conclusion is that we must have @xmath95 and the conditions ( [ c2c1d ] ) or ( [ c1c2d ] ) reduce to an equation for @xmath96 @xmath97 this relation represents the constraint from @xmath62 invariance which was originally expressed as ( [ bcdak ] ) where there were two independent relations . using ( [ rsk ] ) , these two relations are satisfied simultaneously and reduce to a single constraint ( [ sccd ] )",
    ".    the condition ( [ rsk ] ) can also be substituted into ( [ abb ] ) , ( [ bcd ] ) , and ( [ bdc ] ) to give    @xmath98    respectively .",
    "these three relations are a manifestation of vanishing mass eigenvalue .",
    "we can set these equations for @xmath96 equal to get relations among the matrix elements @xmath99 in terms of the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "not all of these equations are independent but two different relations are possible :    @xmath100    [ eq : krel ]    in the next subsection we will write @xmath99 in terms of the mixing angles and thereby get two relations among the mixing angles , again involving @xmath67 .      using @xmath101 from eq.([utot ] ) in @xmath102 and comparing with ( [ m ] ) we get @xcite    @xmath103 m_1 - c_x [ s_s c_s c_a + s_x s_a s_s^2 ] m_2 + c_x s_x s_a m_3 \\label{vb1}\\\\ b_2 & = & c_x [ s_s c_s s_a + s_x c_a c_s^2 ] m_1 - c_x [ s_s c_s s_a - s_x c_a s_s^2 ] m_2 - s_x c_x c_a m_3 \\label{vb2}\\\\ c_1 & = & ( s_s c_a - s_x c_s s_a)^2 m_1 + ( c_s c_a + s_x s_s s_a)^2 m_2 + c_x^2 s_a^2 m_3 \\label{vc1 } \\\\",
