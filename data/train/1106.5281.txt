    "moreover , the significant effects that arise due the higher  multipole terms in the expansion of the electron  photon interaction are also discussed in the context of angular correlation studies . finally , a brief summary is given in section [ sect_summary ] .",
    "since the second  order perturbation theory has been frequently applied in studying two  photon decay , here we may restrict ourselves to a short compilation of the basic formulas relevant for our analysis and refer for all further details to the literature @xcite . within the _ relativistic _ framework ,",
    "the second  order transition amplitude for the emission of two photons with wave vectors @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = 1 , 2 ) and polarization vectors @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the ( many  electron ) states with well  defined total angular momenta @xmath18 and their projections @xmath19 of the ions just before and after their decay , and @xmath20 all the additional quantum numbers as necessary for a unique specification .",

    "the great advantage of formula ( [ s_function_decomposition ] ) is that it helps us to immediately evaluate the many ",
    "electron transition amplitude ( [ s_function ] ) in terms of the ( one  particle ) functions @xmath51 .",
    "the summation over the _",
    "complete _ one  particle spectrum that occurs in these functions can be performed by means of various methods . in the present work",
    ", we make use of ( i ) the relativistic coulomb  green s function @xcite and ( ii ) a b  spline discrete basis set @xcite to evaluate all the second  order transition amplitudes . indeed ,",
    "both approaches yield almost identical results for the angular correlation functions in the two  photon decay of heavy helium  like ions .      equation ( [ m_amplitude_new ] ) displays the general form of the relativistic transition amplitude for the two  photon decay of many  electron ions . such an amplitude represents the `` building block '' for studying various properties of the emitted radiation .",
    "for instance , the differential two  photon decay rate can be written in terms of ( squared ) transition amplitudes as : @xmath52 if we assume that the excited ions are initially unpolarized and that the spin states of the emitted photons remain unobserved in a particular measurement .",
    "as seen from expression ( [ diff_rate ] ) , the two  photon rate is _ single _ differential  owing to the conservation law ( [ energy_conservation])in the energy of one of the photons but _",
    "double _ differential in the emission angles .",
    "accordingly , its further evaluation requires to determine the _ geometry _ under which the photon emission is considered . since no particular direction is preferred for the decay of an unpolarized ( as well as unaligned ) ion , it is convenient to adopt the quantization ( @xmath32 ) axis along the momentum of the `` first '' photon : @xmath53 .",
    "such a choice of the quantization axis allows us to simplify the rate ( [ diff_rate ] ) and to define the _ angular correlation function _ : @xmath54 that is characterized ( apart from the relative energy @xmath55 ) by the single polar angle @xmath56 of the `` second '' photon momentum with respect to this axis . in this expression ,",
    "moreover , the factor @xmath57 arises from the integration over the solid angle @xmath58 of the first photon as well as the integration over the azimuthal angle @xmath59 of the second photon . in the next section",
    ", we shall investigate the dependence of the function @xmath60 on this _ opening angle _",
    "@xmath61 for various bound ",
    "bound transitions and for a range of ( relative ) photon energies .",
    "with the formalism developed above , we are ready now to analyze the angular correlations in the two  photon decay of helium  like heavy ions . in nowadays experiments , the excited states of these ions can be efficiently populated in relativistic ion  atom collisions .",
    "for example , the formation of the metastable @xmath62 state during the inner  shell impact ionization of ( initially ) lithium  like heavy ions has been studied recently at the gsi storage ring in darmstadt @xcite .",
    "the radiative deexcitation of this state can proceed only via the two  photon transition @xmath63 since a single  photon decay to the @xmath64 ground state is strictly forbidden by the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "1 displays the photon ",
    "photon angular correlation function for this experimentally easily accessible decay of helium  like xenon xe@xmath3 , gold au@xmath4 and uranium u@xmath5 ions and for the two energy sharing parameters @xmath55 = 0.1 ( upper panel ) and @xmath55 = 0.5 ( lower panel ) .",
    "moreover , because the radiative transitions in high@xmath6 ions are known to be affected by the higher terms of the electron  photon interaction ( [ a_operator_general ] ) , calculations were performed within both , the exact relativistic theory ( solid line ) to include all allowed multipole components ( @xmath65 ) in the amplitude ( [ m_amplitude_new ] ) as well as the electric dipole approximation ( dashed line ) , if only a single term with @xmath66 and @xmath67 is taken into account . in the dipole 2e1 approach ,",
    "as expected , the angular distribution is well described by the formula @xmath68 that predicts a _",
    "symmetric_with respect to the opening angle @xmath69emission pattern of two photons . within the exact relativistic theory , in contrast , an asymmetric shift in the angular correlation function is obtained . as can be deduced from eqs .",
    "( [ s_function_decomposition])([function_definition ] ) , this shift arises from the interference between the leading 2e1 decay channel and higher multipole terms in the electron ",
    "photon interaction : @xmath70 where , for the sake of brevity , we have introduced the notation @xmath71 . for high@xmath6 domain ,",
    "the photon emission occurs predominantly in the backward directions if the nondipole terms are taken into account ; an effect which becomes more pronounced for the equal energy sharing ( cf .",
    "bottom panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "including the higher multipoles into the photon ",
    "photon correlation function , a similar asymmetry was found in the past for the @xmath72 decay in hydrogen  like heavy ions both within the nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite theory .",
    "apart from the singlet @xmath62 , the formation of the triplet @xmath73 state has been also observed in recent collision experiments at the gsi storage ring @xcite .",
    "although much weaker in intensity ( owing to the dominant m1 transition ) , the two  photon decay of this @xmath74 state has attracted recent interest and might provide an important testing ground for symmetry violations of bose particles @xcite .",
    "the angular correlation between the photons emitted in this @xmath75 ( two  photon ) decay is displayed in fig .  2 , by comparing again the results from the exact relativistic theory with the 2e1 dipole approximation . as seen from the figure , the photon ",
    "photon correlation functions for the @xmath76 transition is much more sensitive with regard to higher multipoles in the electron ",
    "photon interaction than obtained for the @xmath77 decay .",
    "the strongest non  dipole effect can be observed for the equal energy sharing ( @xmath55 = 0.5 ) , where the two  photon emission is strictly _ forbidden _ within the electric dipole approximation .",
    "this suppression of the 2e1 decay is a direct consequence of the exchange symmetry of photons as required by the bose ",
    "einstein statistics and , hence , a particular case of the landau  yang theorem that forbids the decay of vector particles into two photons ( cf .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "in contrast to the 2e1 channel , the e1m2 @xmath78 transition can proceed even if the energies of the two photons are equal .",
    "this transition as well as higher multipole terms give rise to a strongly anisotropic correlation function that vanishes for the parallel and back  to  back photon emission and has a maximum at @xmath69 .",
    "large effects due to the higher multipole contributions to the @xmath79 two  photon transition can be observed not only for the case of equal energy sharing ( @xmath55 = 0.5 ) . for the relative energy @xmath55 = 0.1 , for example , the photon ",
    "photon angular correlation function is found symmetric with regard to @xmath69 in the electric dipole ( 2e1 ) approximation but becomes asymmetric in an exact relativistic theory .",
    "in contrast to the decay of @xmath80 state , however , a predominant _ parallel emission _ of both photons appears to be more likely if the higher multipoles are taken into account . for the @xmath78 two  photon decay of helium  like uranium u@xmath5 , for example",
    ", the intensity ratio @xmath81 increases from _ unity _ within the electric dipole approximation to almost 1.6 in the exact relativistic treatment .    until now we have discussed the photon ",
    "photon correlations in the decay of @xmath82 ( singlet and triplet ) helium  like states .",
    "besides these  well studied ",
    "transitions , recent theoretical interest has been focused also on the @xmath83 two  photon decay whose properties are expected to be sensitive to ( parity violating ) pnc phenomena in atomic systems @xcite .",
    "future investigations on such subtle parity non  conservation effects will require first detailed knowledge on the angle ( and polarization ) properties of two  photon emission as well as the role of non  dipole contributions .",
    "the angular correlation function ( [ function_definition ] ) for the @xmath84 transition is displayed in fig .",
    "3 , again , for two relative photon energies @xmath55 = 0.1 and 0.5 and for the nuclear charges @xmath6 = 54 , 79 and 92 .",
    "calculations have been performed both within the exact theory and the ( `` electric and magnetic '' ) dipole approximation which accounts for the leading e1m1m1e1 decay channel .",
    "as seen from the figure , the emission pattern strongly depends on the energy sharing between the photons . if , for example , one of the photons is more energetic than the second one their parallel emission becomes dominant ( cf .",
    "upper panel of fig .",
    "in contrast , photons with equal energies , i.e. when @xmath55 = 0.5 , are more likely to be emitted back  to  back while the differential rate ( [ diff_rate ] ) vanishes identically for @xmath85 . such a behaviour of the photon  photon angular correlation function is caused by the interference between _ two _ pathways which appear for each multipole component of the @xmath84 transition .",
    "for instance , the leading e1m1m1e1 decay may proceed either via intermediate @xmath86 or @xmath87 states , thus given rise to a `` double  slit '' picture that becomes most pronounced for the equal energy sharing .",
    "simple analytical expression for the angular correlation function which accounts for such a young  type interference effect can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ s_function_decomposition])([diff_rate ] ) as : @xmath88 where , similar as before , we denote @xmath89 and @xmath90 . obviously , if the energies of the two photons are equal , @xmath91 , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ w_2 ] ) turns to be _",
    "zero _ and the photon emission is described by the @xmath92 angular distribution modified by the non  dipole terms in the expansion of electron  photon interaction . as seen from the lower panel of fig .  3 , the contribution from these terms becomes more pronounced for the back  to  back photon emission ( @xmath61 = 180@xmath93 ) where they lead to about a 30 % enhancement of the correlation function .",
    "it is interesting to note that such an enhancement remains almost constant along the helium isoelectronic sequence for @xmath94 54 due to similar ( @xmath95 ) scaling of the e1m1 and e2m2 transition probabilities .",
    "therefore , our calculations clearly indicate the importance of higher multipoles for analyzing the photon ",
    "photon correlations not only for high@xmath6 domain but also for medium@xmath6 ions .",
    "in summary , the two  photon decay of heavy , helium  like ions has been investigated within the framework of the relativistic second  order perturbation theory and the independent particle model . in this study ,",
    "special emphasis was placed on the angular correlations between the emitted photons .",
    "a general expression for the photon  photon correlation function was derived that accounts for the complete expansion of the radiation field in terms of its multipole components . based on solutions of dirac s equation ,",
    "this function has been calculated for the two  photon decay of the @xmath96 , @xmath74 and @xmath2 states of helium  like xenon xe@xmath3 , gold au@xmath4 and uranium u@xmath5 ions . as seen from the results obtained",
    ", the photon emission pattern appears to be sensitive to the symmetry and parity of the particular excited state as well as to the higher multipole contributions to the electron ",
    "photon interaction .",
    "the strongest non  dipole effects have been identified for the @xmath97 two  photon transition for which the 2e1 decay channel is forbidden owing to symmetrization properties of the system . for the other two transitions , @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ", the higher multipoles of the radiation field typically result in a 1030 % deviation of the photon  photon correlation function from the ( analytical ) predictions obtained within the dipole 2e1 approximation .",
    "this deviation becomes most apparent for the parallel and back  to  back photon emission and may be observed not only for high@xmath6 but also for medium@xmath6 ions .    the second  order perturbation approach based on",
    "the independent particle model , used in the present calculations , is appropriate for the analysis of forthcoming experimental studies on the two  photon transitions between the @xmath100 excited and the ground states of helium  like , heavy ions .",
    "besides these spontaneous decays , whose energies usually reach 100 kev , _ induced _",
    "@xmath101 transitions between excited states are also likely to be explored at the gsi ion storage ring @xcite .",
    "having energies in the optical range ( 23 ev ) , these transitions may provide an alternative and very promising tool for studying the parity violation phenomena .",
    "their theoretical analysis , however , requires a more systematic treatment of the electron  electron interaction effects .",
