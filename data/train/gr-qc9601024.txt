    "gravitational wave detection is a research field which is actively under development by many groups all over the world ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from the theoretical point of view",
    "all the devices yet operating or under construction could be divided into two classes : the resonant detectors and the interferometers . in the first case one",
    "tries to detect the motion of an elastic body due to the gravitational tidal forces acting on it . in the second one",
    "the gravitational phase shift on an electromagnetic wave is exploited . in both cases",
    "the detection is due to _ only one _ kind of direct gravitational interaction with matter .",
    "for instance , in the resonant bar detector arrangement , the direct interaction of the gravitational wave with the solid body produces mechanical oscillations which are converted into an electric signal by a capacitive transducer and then amplified and recorded .",
    "the bar is the only constituent of the apparatus which directly interacts with the gravitational wave .",
    "the transducer system can not distinguish if the mechanical motion is due to a gravitational wave or another source .    in this paper we will study the behaviour of a mechanical oscillator and an electromagnetic circuit rigidly mounted on one end of it , _ both directly interacting _ with a periodic gravitational wave ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . as a first preliminary result , we will find the rest frame of one end of a damped oscillator in the field of a gravitational wave , generalizing a result contained in  @xcite .",
    "then we will show that the device described in fig .",
    "1 is characterized by a sort of coherent effect : in some configuration the effect is to amplify the response of the electromagnetic system by the mechanical quality factor of the oscillator .",
    "this coherent effect , besides being interesting in itself , could be taken into consideration in future experiments for almost two reasons : in fact we will show that the detection limit of such a device , for periodic sources like pulsars ( frequency range @xmath0 ) , at ultracryogenic temperatures and for sufficiently long integration times ( up to 4 months ) seems very interesting , being of the order of @xmath1@xmath2 in the metric perturbation ( when thermal noise , shot noise and amplifier back ",
    "action are taken into account ) ; moreover , and this is the most important peculiarity , there is a decrease of the problem of mechanical insulation , because the sensitivity of the circuit can be considered independently of noise affecting the mechanical oscillator .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this arrangement the electromagnetic circuit , in some sense which will be clearer afterwards , `` recognizes '' if the mechanical oscillator signal is a gravitational one or not .",
    "recently it has been shown @xcite how , under certain conditions , a set of conductors behaves in the field of a gravitational wave .",
    "these conditions are essentially three .",
    "the first one is about the electromagnetic field : it is considered in the long  wavelength approximation in which the frequency of the electromagnetic oscillations @xmath3 is much smaller than @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the typical linear size of the system and @xmath6 is the speed of light ) .",
    "the second one is about the gravitational field : the spatial distance @xmath7 over which the gravitational wave changes appreciably must be much greater than @xmath5 .",
    "the last condition is about the mechanical behaviour of the system : it is freely falling in the field of the incoming wave .",
    "this implies that it is at rest in tt  gauge , reference frame in which the calculation is performed . within the framework of these assumptions the equations for a system of @xmath8 conducting non ",
    "ferromagnetic one dimensional ( wires ) or extended bodies ( capacitors ) in the presence of a gravitational wave are derived .",
    "this is made by means of an extension of the lagrangian formalism ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , in which the charges on the conducting bodies play the rle of generalized coordinates .",
    "we have found that the behaviour of such a system is completely described by a lagrangian together with a dissipation function in which the coefficients of mutual inductance @xmath9 , the inverse of the capacity coefficients @xmath10 and the resistances @xmath11 that characterize the system are modified by the gravitational wave ( here the subscript @xmath12 means the _ a  th _ conductor ) .",
    "this could be summarized by the following relations @xmath13 where the _ zero _ quantities are the usual flat space ",
    "time ones , while @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the time dependent perturbations induced by the gravitational waves on the circuit parameters ; they can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the metric perturbation which describe the gravitational wave in tt  gauge ( @xmath19 is the metric tensor , greek indices run from 0 to 3 ; latin indices from 1 to 3 )  @xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ lambdaab])([rhoa ] ) , are pure geometric quantities which play a similar rle as the mass - quadrupole tensor @xmath27 in the mechanical interaction between a gravitational wave and a solid body .",
    "we see therefore that the equations that describe the system are parametric ones .",
    "this means that gravity _ is not _ acting as an electromotive force _ but _ is changing the circuit parameters .",
    "the effect of the small perturbations of the circuit parameters when there is no electrostatic charge distribution is a frequency and amplitude modulation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider the circuit described in fig .",
    "2 . it is an rlc circuit with two plane and statically charged condensers set at right angles .",
    "when a periodic gravitational wave ( for the sake of simplicity coming from a direction perpendicular to the circuit plane ) interacts with such a circuit , a current is produced . in this case",
    "the effects of the parametric interaction given by  ( [ pertparam ] ) and  ( [ quadru ] ) could be summarized by the relations @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{1}{c_i(t ) } & = & \\frac{1}{c_i } [ 1 - \\varepsilon_{c_i}(t ) ]   \\qquad\\qquad i=1,2 \\\\",
    "r(t ) & = & [ 1+\\varepsilon_r(t ) ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the unperturbed inductance , capacitance and resistance and the perturbations are very small compared to unity , being of the order of the amplitude of the perturbation of the flat space ",
    "time metric in tt  gauge . in a reference frame",
    "in which the @xmath32 and @xmath33 axis are parallel to the plates of @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively then the current flowing is a small modulation of the solution of the following equation ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( 1/lc)$ ] , @xmath39 , @xmath40 )  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the `` plus '' tt - gauge polarization amplitude of a gravitational wave  @xcite .",
    "( [ equat ] ) is valid both for the ohmic and the superconducting case , provided that @xmath44 is the inverse of the damping time of the circuit in the two cases .",
    "the conclusion is that in the case of interaction with circuits having a distribution of electrostatic charge the most important effect of the gravitational wave is to produce an electromotive force having the order of magnitude of the electrostatic potential in one condenser times the amplitude of the metric perturbation in tt - gauge . if we consider eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) we can see that it is the analogue of the tidal acceleration in the equation of motion of a mechanical oscillator . here",
    "the electrostatic charge has taken the place of the rest length of the oscillator , and the capacitance that of the inverse of the elastic constant of the spring .",
    "in which follows we will study what happens if we rigidly mount with no moving parts this particular circuit on one end of a mechanical harmonic oscillator .",
    "the key idea is to treat the electromagnetic system in the frame in which it is at rest so we can use the results of ref .",
    "in the local inertial frame @xmath45 , the so  called fermi normal coordinates ( fnc frame ) @xcite , the interaction with a gravitational wave of a harmonic oscillator made of two masses @xmath46 , connected with a spring of equilibrium length @xmath47 in the direction @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , in the case in which the wave depends only on time ( @xmath50 ) , is described by the geodesic deviation law ( see , for instance ,  @xcite , p.  1023 ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the fnc of one of the two masses , @xmath53 is the proper frequency of the oscillator and @xmath54 its relaxation time .",
    "the right  hand side of this equation contains the `` electric '' components of the riemann tensor of the wave in tt coordinates , @xmath55 . in linear approximation",
    "the riemann tensor is gauge invariant , i.e. it does not depend on the chosen coordinate system .",
    "the solution in fourier space [ @xmath56 @xmath57 , in linear approximation , is given by @xmath58 within the framework of long wavelength approximation ( @xmath59 ) , the fnc metric could be written as ( see , for instance ,  @xcite , p. 332 ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "therefore up to @xmath62 terms the fnc metric could be safely taken as @xmath63 in the region of our interest .",
    "now we introduce a new coordinate system @xmath64 which follows the motion of the mass . to this aim , we consider the following coordinate transformations @xmath65 @xmath66 the new metric ( the rest metric ) can be written , neglecting @xmath67 terms , as [ see , for instance ,  @xcite , eq .",
    "( 83.6 ) or  @xcite , eq .  ( 4.3 ) ] @xmath68 in this frame , in the same approximation , the mass under consideration is at rest ; in fact , calling @xmath69 its coordinates , then geodesic equation becomes @xmath70 we note that , within the range of the approximations made , the rest frame has the same properties  ( [ ttg ] ) of a tt ",
    "gauge one .",
    "we further observe that if we consider the limit @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( free masses ) then @xmath73 and eqs .",
    "( [ 3a ] ) and  ( [ 3b ] ) become the transformation laws from the tt  gauge to the fnc to the first order in the @xmath74 ratio  @xcite ; in other words the rest frame becomes the tt - gauge ( as it must be because it is the rest frame for free bodies ) .",
    "let us consider now the case of an electromagnetic circuit rigidly mounted on one end of a mechanical harmonic oscillator . in the rest frame",
    "we are within the framework of the theory summarized in section 2 .",
    "we can therefore apply the results of  @xcite by simply substituting the @xmath75 metric with the rest metric .",
    "therefore the rest frame solves the problem of the simultaneous interaction of a gravitational wave with a mechanical oscillator _ and _ an electromagnetic circuit , being the frame in which only the coupling with the latter occurs .",
    "it is to be remarked that we are dealing with currents in electromagnetic circuits in tt  gauge . in actual experiments currents",
    "are measured in the laboratory reference frame ( fnc ) . however , because of the charge conservation we can write @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the current measured in the fnc and @xmath78 the one measured in a tt  gauge ( in this case the rest frame ) . because of eq .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) , the relation between currents in the two gauges reads @xmath79 in the long wavelength approximation both first order corrections are negligible so that @xmath80 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to observe that the situation envisaged in this section _ is not _ equivalent to the case of a mechanical oscillator driven by an artificial force .",
    "in fact the equation of motion of the oscillator in this case is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 are three functions of time .",
    "if we now introduce a rest frame , that is to say a frame comoving with the mass element of the mechanical oscillator over which is mounted the electromagnetic device , and calculate the metric tensor in this frame , we find thatthe metric is unchanged .",
    "in fact , if @xmath83 is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ref1 ] ) , then the coordinate system @xmath84 of the rest frame is given by @xmath85 the new metric will then be given by ( it has to be remembered that in the long wavelength approximation the fnc perturbation of the metric is negligible ) @xmath86 in the same approximation as before @xmath87 could be neglected ; therefore we are led to the conclusion that @xmath88 this result shows the difference between an external driving force on the mechanical oscillator and a gravitational wave , difference which lies in the tidal nature of the latter .",
    "let us consider now the case of a monochromatic gravitational wave of angular frequency @xmath89 .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath64 can be now written as [ @xmath90 ; @xmath91 is the mechanical quality factor ] : @xmath92 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the rest metric takes the form @xmath93 \\label{7}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 in the resonant case , @xmath95 , @xmath96 while @xmath97 so that the rest metric at mechanical resonance becomes : @xmath98 therefore the interaction of the gravitational wave at mechanical resonance produces , on the electromagnetic circuit , a sort of effective metric perturbation larger by a factor @xmath99 and @xmath100 phase shifted .",
    "the amplification mechanism described in previous section concerns only gravitational signals that coherently interact with both the mechanical oscillator and the electromagnetic device . in fact , if the mechanical oscillator is accelerated , the order of magnitude of the inertial electromotive force induced on the electromagnetic system is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the electronic mass @xmath103 its charge and @xmath104 the magnitude of the acceleration and @xmath5 the linear size of the circuit .. if the energy of the motion ( for instance thermal noise ) is comparable with the one due to the gravitational wave interaction then @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the order of magnitude of the gravitational wave amplitude .",
    "let us consider now the circuit of fig .",
    "the order of magnitude of the electromotive force induced by a gravitational wave with @xmath106 amplitude is [ see eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) or  @xcite ] @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the order of magnitude of the electrostatic potential in the condensers .",
    "the ratio between these two electromotive forces is @xmath109 where we have put @xmath110 , @xmath111 is expressed in hz and @xmath108 in volts . even setting @xmath112 and @xmath113 we obtain @xmath114 for the ratio . in conclusion , in order to calculate the sensitivity of the device it suffices to consider noise only on the electromagnetic circuit .",
    "hence , at mechanical resonance , the sensitivity in @xmath106 is increased by the mechanical quality factor @xmath115 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) ] .",
    "in this section noise is evaluated in order to obtain the sensitivity of such a device . taking into account discussion made in sec .",
    "v , only noise on the electromagnetic circuit is considered .",
    "we take into account thermal mechanical noise , thermal electric noise , back action of the amplifier and shot noise of the difference of the leakage current of the condensers .",
    "mechanical thermal noise describes the relative variation of length of inductance ( or distance between plates of condensers ) caused by thermal noise . in the free falling mechanical approximation ( see  @xcite ) , the amplitude of the gravitational wave having a signal to mechanical noise ratio equal to 1 after an observation time @xmath116 , is [ see eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) ] : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the boltzman constant , @xmath119 the temperature of mechanical degree of freedom , and @xmath46 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the mass , length and damping time of mechanical oscillators describing condensers or inductance from the mechanical point of view .",
    "the analogue for the electric thermal noise at electric resonance ( @xmath122 ) is [ see  @xcite , eq .",
    "( 6.44 ) ] : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the electric quality factor of the circuit , and @xmath125 .",
    "another noise source to take into account for is the shot noise of the difference , @xmath126 , of the leakage current of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the gravitational signal with a signal to leakage noise ratio equal to @xmath127 after an observation time @xmath116 is [ see  @xcite and  @xcite , eqs .",
    "( 6.15 ) and  ( 6.26 ) ] @xmath128 where @xmath103 is the absolute value of the electronic charge and we can set @xmath129  @xcite .",
    "once the bar and the electromagnetic circuit are isolated from the outside world by means of mechanical filters and faraday cages a further noise source is the back  action of the amplifier .",
    "however , at cryogenic temperature and for the best amplifiers , this is at most of the same order of magnitude of thermal noise .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the gravitational radiation having a signal to noise ratio equal to @xmath127 is given by @xmath130    in order to obtain the order of magnitude of @xmath131 , the parameters which enter in eqs .",
    "( [ hmtn])([totnoise ] ) had to be set .",
    "attention must be paid to the fact that weight and size of the electric circuit are constrained by the mechanical harmonic oscillator to one end of which the circuit is rigidly mounted .",
    "a possible choice is : @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 in the ohmic case and @xmath140 for superconducting circuit .",
    "moreover we assume to operate at cryogenic ( @xmath141 ) and ultracryogenic ( @xmath142 ) temperatures and for gravitational wave frequencies of @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the reason of this last choice is twofold : first , the possibility to realize resonant mechanical detectors operating at these frequencies  @xcite ; second , the presence of possible almost monochromatic sources such as crab pulsar  @xcite or millisecond pulsars  @xcite . in this range",
    "it is found that the leakage noise is negligibly small .",
    "moreover for superconducting circuit , mechanical thermal noise is always the biggest noise source , while in the ohmic case , at the higher gravitational frequency , electric thermal noise becomes more relevant than mechanical one .",
    "the results can be found in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] .    in order to make comparisons with the predicted sensitivities of ground based interferometric detectors such as virgo and ligo ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , for gravitational signals from pulsars , we introduce the so called characteristic amplitude @xmath145 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 50 ) ; setting @xmath146 the `` plus '' tt  gauge amplitude polarization we have : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight to the source .",
    "therefore the amplitude @xmath145 of the weakest source detectable with a signal to noise ratio equal to @xmath149 in @xmath150 integration time , with known frequency , is therefore given by @xmath151 the results for ohmic and superconducting circuit are given in tabs .",
    "[ tab2 ] and  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the incertitude takes into account for different possible orientations of the rotation axis .",
    "a comparison with ligo sensitivities ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) shows that , near @xmath152 , the expected sensitivity is of the order of @xmath153 for initial detector and @xmath154 for advanced detector , while near @xmath144 the expected sensitivities are @xmath155 and @xmath156 for initial and advanced detector respectively .",
    "summarizing , at ultracryogenic temperatures , a device such as that described in this paper could have the same sensitivity as a ground based interferometer of the first generation near @xmath152 , while for higher frequencies the sensitivity seems to be comparable also with that of an advanced interferometer .",
    "these preliminary results are encouraging and show that a device exploiting coherent interaction amplification could be interesting in the field of gravitational wave detection .",
    "we have found the rest frame for one end of a damped harmonic oscillator in the field of a gravitational wave .",
    "this rest frame has been used to obtain the current flowing in an rlc circuit with an electrostatic charge , rigidly mounted on that end and interacting itself with the wave .",
    "the result on the circuit behaviour could be described as a coherent effect between two electromotive forces always in phase : the inertial one ( produced by the elastic motion of the harmonic oscillator in the field of the gravitational wave ) and the one induced directly on the circuit by the wave .",
    "together with this it must be noted that , not having a definite phase , inertial electromotive forces due to noise bar vibrations do not couple coherently with the circuit . therefore an rlc circuit mounted on one end of a mechanical bar detector operating on the same frequency could be an interesting amplifier of gravitational periodic signals , as for instance those produced by pulsars and in particular millisecond pulsars  @xcite .",
    "this new way of amplify signals could reduce the problems of the mechanical insulation of the bar , because noise bar vibrations do not couple with the circuit with the same strength as the case of vibration of gravitational origin .",
