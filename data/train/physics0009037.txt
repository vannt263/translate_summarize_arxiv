    "the various types of devices utilizing the electron beam interaction with electromagnetic fields in slow - wave system ( cherenkov @xcite , smith - purcell @xcite , quasi - cherenkov @xcite , transition @xcite radiation mechanisms ) was considered in the past.the great number of researches in the area of microwave electronics resulted in the traveling wave tube ( twt ) , backward - wave oscillator ( bwo ) , orotrons and so on .",
    "theory of such generators , as a rule , considers the one - dimentional ( longitudinal ) dynamics of electrons in the field of an electromagnetic wave . on the other hand in our previous works devoted to quasi - cherenkov fel the stimulated emission of unmagnetized electron beam with three - dimensional dynamics",
    "was studied ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in our works",
    "@xcite , @xcite the guiding field was considered as strong and the electron beam dynamics as one - dimensional .",
    "it was shown that quasi - cherenkov volume fel ( vfel ) can produce radiation with lower current density ( especially in x - ray spectrum region of frequencies ) in comparison with ordinary fels . however , multiple scattering of electrons in the medium destructs the coherence of radiation process .",
    "the surface scheme of the quasi - cherenkov vfel can be used for multiple scattering reducing ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in that case an electron beam moves over a periodic medium at a distance @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the radiation wavelength , @xmath4 is the electron lorentz factor ) and radiation is formed along the whole electron trajectory in vacuum without multiple scattering . in these works",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) the generation of the surface parametric fel was considered for electron beam placed in strong longitudinal guiding magnetic field .",
    "so , only the contribution of the one - dimensional ( longitudinal ) dynamics of electrons to stimulated radiation was considered .",
    "this is true if inequality @xmath5 is satisfied ( @xmath6 is the magnitude of magnetic field , @xmath7 is the detuning from synchronism condition ) . in opposite case",
    "@xmath8 it is necessary to take into account the transverse motion of electrons .",
    "the @xmath7 increases with the interaction length @xmath9 decrease ( @xmath9 is the length of interaction between the electron beam and radiation ) and with the current density increase .",
    "therefore the transverse motion contributes to stimulated quasi - cherenkov emission in the case of high current or small interaction length ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the langmuir frequency ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of volume fel ( vfel ) operation in the periodic slow - wave structures including the effect of the finite guiding magnetic field value on stimulated emission .",
    "so we take into account the contribution of transverse electron beam motion to generation process . using the linearized perturbation field approximation",
    "we derive the boundary conditions , dispersion relations and generation equation .",
    "all results received below relate to compton regime , when the amplitudes of excited longitudinal langmuir waves are small .",
    "raman regime was considered in our previos work @xcite in two limiting cases 1)when guiding magnetic field is absent ; 2)when guiding field is strong .",
    "the considered system is represented on figure [ fig.1 ] . an electron beam located at height @xmath12 over the spatial periodic structure is moving parallel to structure surface .",
    "@xmath13 is the beam thickness in the direction normal to the surface .",
    "the axis @xmath14 is chosen along the direction of electron motion , the axis @xmath15 is normal to the periodic structure surface .",
    "dynamical diffraction on the periodic structure forms the 3-dimensional volume distribution feedback which provides generation regime . the set of reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath16 defining diffraction process can be directed at an arbitrary angle relative to the particle velocity and to the surface , ( @xmath17 are translation periods of periodic structure , @xmath18 are intergers ) .",
    "the interaction between the electron beam and the grating produces an emission spectrum .",
    "the emission frequency is defined by the spatial period and by the volume geometry ( by the direction of the reciprocal vectors for example ) . the periodic structure perfoms two basic functions .",
    "firstly it slows down the phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave that enables conditions for coherent radiation .",
    "secondly , due to 3-dimensional distributed feedback , the periodic structure is an effective volume resonator , which gives the possibility for an oscillator regime realization .",
    "the emitted photons bunch the electron beam .",
    "this bunching leads to greater emission , which leads to more bunching.three-dimensional bragg distributed feedback keeps emission in the interaction region .",
    "the regime of an oscillator is realized as the result of these processes .",
    "dependence of the emitted wavelength on system geometry provides smooth frequency tuning . for deriving the generation equation",
    "it is necessary to obtain the dispersion equations in all regions and to use the boundary conditions on the surfaces of the electron beam and surfaces of the slow - wave structure .",
    "in most of previous works concerning slow - wave fels the electron beam is considered as magnetized .",
    "therefore only longitudinal dynamics of electron beam was taken into account .",
    "the magnetic field is used for electron beam guiding over slow - wave structure surface .",
    "however , the transverse motion of electron still can contribute to the process of stimulated radiation .",
    "the contribution of transverse degrees of freedom depends on : 1 ) parameters of an electron beam such as the energy of electrons , current density , the velocity spread of an electron beam ; 2 ) the parameters of emitted radiation such as photon wavelength and the field amplitudes ; 3 ) the parameters of the electrodynamical structure such as photoabsoption length , interaction length of electron beam with emitted radiation and the binding of an electron beam with eigenmodes of an electrodynamic system ; 4 ) the magnitude of guiding field .    the slow electromagnetic wave which is in synhronism with the electron beam produces modulation of the density and current density .",
    "this leads to development of instability .",
    "the stimulated radiation is the result of this instability .",
    "let us consider the influence of guiding magnetic field on the stimulated radiation .",

    "we shall study the compton regime of cherenkov instability .",
    "the terms corresponding to second order resonances give maximal contributions in that case .",
    "below we use this fact for separation of wave polarisations .",
    "the dispersion equation in the region filled with electron beam is defined by equating of the determinant of the system to zero .",
    "@xmath35 here @xmath36 is derived from ( [ bas1 ] ) ( @xmath37 .",
    "it is considered in this case that @xmath38 in the region with electron beam ) .",
    "let us discuss some features of this dispersion equation .",
    "in general case of an arbitrary guiding magnetic field it has six roots @xmath39 , @xmath40 . for the case of strong guiding magnetic field",
    "when the condition @xmath41 there exist four roots    @xmath42    the fist two roots correspond to electromagnetic waves which do nt interact with the electron beam .",
    "the last two roots correspond to waves which are result of electromagnetic wave with electron beam interactions.in particular case when @xmath43 , these two wave degenerate to longitudinal slow and fast langmuir waves with the dispersion equation @xmath44 .    in the opposite case of low guiding field , when inequality @xmath45 is satisfied there exist four roots of ( [ disp1 ] )    @xmath46    and the langmuir waves polarized parallel to wavevector @xmath47 .",

    "the electromagnetic field in the slow wave structure ( @xmath54 ) can be written as a sum of bloch functions    @xmath55    where @xmath56 satisfies to conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 is arbitrary translation vector of spatially periodic slow - wave structure .",
    "to derive the generation conditions it is necessary to write the equations for field coefficient in ( [ bb1],[vac1],[str1 ] ) .",
