    "the main goal of studying medium - induced modifications to hard processes in heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions is to do jet tomography on the medium @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is as follows : since hard processes take place slightly before the creation of a soft bulk medium , high @xmath3 partons have to traverse the medium before hadronization , and interactions with the soft medium subsequently lead to an energy redistribution , resulting in a suppression of observed hard hadron yield .",
    "the strength of the interaction with the medium reflects the density of the medium , thus one should be able to gain information about the medium density from the observed strength of the suppression .",
    "the chief observable considered so far has been the nuclear suppression factor of single hadrons @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) which is the measured yield in a - a collisions divided by the yield in proton - proton ( p - p ) collisions multiplied with the number of binary scatterings ( i.e. the default expectation if there would not be soft processes forming a medium in an a - a collision ) .",
    "there are at the moment two main scenarios which are considered in models to explain the measured suppression : energy loss and the medium - modified parton shower . in the energy loss picture ,",
    "the approximation is made that a single parton carries most of the energy and momentum of the event .",
    "note that this approximation is justified for single inclusive hadron spectra or back - to - back correlations , but clearly not for fully reconstructed jets . in traversing the medium",
    ", this leading parton loses energy to the medium and subsequently fragments into a hadron shower in vacuum after emerging from the medium with reduced energy .",
    "this picture describes the available data well @xcite using e.g. the armesto - salgado - wiedemann ( asw ) implementation @xcite of energy loss .",
    "the energy loss model itself does not explicitly specify what happens to the lost energy ( it is computed in the form of gluon radiation , but clearly also radiated gluons would re - interact with the medium ) , but it is often assumed that lost energy excites shockwaves in a hydrodynamical bulk medium , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the medium - modified parton shower picture is not restricted to the approximation that a single parton carries most of the energy and momentum , as it follows medium - modified evolution equations for the full sequence of branchings of the initially produced high virtuality parton .",
    "only the nonperturbative part of fragmentation , i.e. hadronization , is assumed to take place outside the medium .",
    "there is a class of models in which this evolution of a whole parton distribution is followed analytically @xcite and also monte - carlo ( mc ) descriptions of the in - medium shower @xcite based on the vacuum shower evolution routines in pythia @xcite or herwig @xcite . while these models can account for @xmath4 well , usually the detailed comparison with more differential observables is not quite as advanced yet due to the greater complexity of these models .",
    "the important difference to the energy loss picture is that in the medium - modified parton shower picture , the flow of energy from the leading parton to subleading partons is explicitly traced .",
    "thus , such models make a very clear prediction that the energy lost from the leading shower partons leads to increased parton ( and subsequently hadron ) production at lower momenta in the shower .",
    "@xmath1-hadron correlations @xcite offer a way to distinguish the two scenarios .",
    "if the medium - modified parton shower picture is the correct way to describe the energy redistribution due to the medium , the additional multiparticle production at low @xmath0 can be experimentally found as a substantial enhancement of the per trigger yield scaled to the per trigger yield in p - p collisions ( @xmath5 in a comparatively narrow angular region ( say @xmath6 ) back to the photon at low @xmath7 ( where for each hadron @xmath8 the relation @xmath9 links hadron energy @xmath10 and photon energy @xmath11 ) . here",
    ", the photon serves both as an indicator that a hard process has taken place and to identify the kinematics of that process . on the other hand ,",
    "if the energy is redistributed as a shockwave in the medium @xcite , any correlation of hadrons with the photon will be at thermal momenta and at large angles , thus it will _ not _ lead to an enhancement of @xmath12 when only an angular region of @xmath6 is considered to extract the per - trigger yield of hadrons correlated with the photon .",
    "however , in both scenarios an @xmath12 below unity is expected at high @xmath7 since this is the kinematical region from which energy is lost and which is also probed in @xmath4 .    in this paper , we present a systematic comparison of @xmath12 computed both in the energy loss picture and the medium - modified parton shower picture . for the energy loss picture",
    ", we use the asw quenching weights @xcite . note",
    "that this formalism is very well constrained by other data @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 in the medium - modified shower picture is computed using the mc code yajem ( yet another jet energy - loss model ) @xcite using the ratiative energy loss ( rad ) setting .",
    "both calculations are done using the same 3-d hydrodynamical model of the bulk medium evolution @xcite which is constrained by a large number of bulk observables . in the following , we consider only direct photons and assume that photons from fragmentation processes which would otherwise be a small modification to the results can be separated experimentally , either statistically or by means of isolation cuts .",
    "the model has four main building blocks : 1 ) the primary hard photon and parton production , 2 ) the propagation of the away side partons through the medium and the parton - medium interaction 3 ) the evolution of the bulk medium and 4 ) the hadronization of partons emerging from the medium .",
    "steps 1 ) and 3 ) are common to both the energy loss and the medium - modified parton shower picture , but 2 ) and 4 ) will be described separately for the energy loss picture in the asw formalism and for the medium - modified parton shower picture in yajem .",
    "3 ) is computed in the 3-d hydrodynamical model by bass and nonaka which is described elsewhere @xcite . in the hydrodynamical model ,",
    "thermodynamical properties like the medium energy density @xmath13 or its temperature @xmath14 can be computed at all spacetime points .",
    "the framework in which all the in ingredients are merged is a mc code for the generation of back - to - back events in the medium which has been used extensively for the computation of hard dihadron correlations @xcite and is described there in detail .",
    "the presentation here will just outline the essential physics issues .",
    "the production of a hard partons @xmath15 and a photon @xmath1 in leading order ( lo ) perturbative quantum choromdynamics ( pqcd ) is described by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the colliding objects ( protons or nuclei ) and @xmath19 is the rapidity of parton @xmath15 and the photon @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution function of a parton type @xmath20 in @xmath17 at a momentum fraction @xmath21 and a factorization scale @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "the distribution functions are different for the free protons @xcite and nucleons in nuclei @xcite .",

    "we find the relative strength of the production channels as a function of @xmath3 . in the kinematic range probed at rhic",
    ", @xmath32 dominates , thus quark jets are predominantly correlated with a photon trigger .    for the present investigation , we require @xmath33 , i.e. we consider only back - to - back correlations detected at midrapidity . in a first step , we sample eq .",

    ", we fold into the distribution an intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath34 with a gaussian distribution , thus creating a momentum imbalance between the photon and the parton as @xmath35 .    assuming that the photon does not interact further with the medium , we test at this point if the photon momentum falls into a specified trigger range .",
    "if not , a new event is generated , otherwise the event is processed further by computing the fate of the away side parton . for this , first the production point in the transverse plane must be found .",
    "the probability density @xmath36 for finding a hard vertex at the transverse position @xmath37 and impact parameter @xmath38 is in leading order given by the product of the nuclear profile functions as @xmath39 where the thickness function is given in terms of woods - saxon the nuclear density @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ e - profile ] ) may receive ( presumably ) small corrections when going beyond a leading order calculation .    after the first step , we thus have generated a back - to - back event of a photon and a parton with known kinematics @xmath42 and initial vertex position in the transverse plane @xmath43 .",
    "partons can now be propagated from this position through the medium for a fixed angle with the reaction plane or averaged over all angles . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the latter option .      for any angle @xmath44 of the parton with the reaction plane , the path of the parton through the medium @xmath45",
    "is specified by @xmath46 and we can compute the energy loss probability @xmath47 for this path .",
    "we do this by evaluating the line integrals @xmath48 along the path where we assume the relation @xmath49 between the local transport coefficient @xmath50 ( specifying the quenching power of the medium ) , the energy density @xmath13 and the local flow rapidity @xmath51 with angle @xmath52 between flow and parton trajectory .",
    "energy density @xmath13 and local flow rapidity @xmath51 are the input from the 3-d hydrodynamical simulation of the medium evolution @xcite .    @xmath53 is the characteristic gluon frequency , setting the scale of the energy loss probability distribution , and @xmath54 is a measure of the path - length weighted by the local quenching power .",
    "we view the parameter @xmath55 as a tool to account for the uncertainty in the selection of @xmath56 and possible non - perturbative effects increasing the quenching power of the medium ( see discussion in @xcite ) and adjust it such that pionic @xmath4 for central au - au collisions is described .",
    "this leads to a value of @xmath57 @xcite .    using the numerical results of @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath58 for @xmath53 and @xmath59 for given parton production vertex and angle @xmath44 .",
    "we sample this distribution to determine the actual energy loss of the away side parton in the event and subtract it from the away side parton .",
    "the away side parton @xmath15 is considered completely absorbed by the medium whenever @xmath60 .",
    "if the parton emerges with a finite amount of energy left , it is subsequently hadronized .",
    "hadronization is modelled by an expansion of the fragmentation function in terms of a tower of conditional probability densities @xmath61 with the probability to produce @xmath62 hadrons with momentum fractions @xmath63 from a parton with momentum @xmath3 being @xmath64 .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in @xcite where we used pythia @xcite to simulate the shower , in the present paper we employ herwig @xcite instead .",
    "we use the exact expressions for the first two terms and the approximations    @xmath65    and    @xmath66    for the next two terms of the expansion .",
    "this expansion only becomes invalid at very low @xmath67 , we will thus exclude this region from the discussion of results .",
    "thus , for each event in the back - to - back mc code , we have after hadronization up to four hadrons from which we calculate the conditional per - trigger yield given the initial photon .",
    "we compute this conditional yield as a function of @xmath7 which is the fraction of the photon momentum taken by each hadron .",
    "note that due to the intrinsic @xmath34 smearing , @xmath7 can be above unity , unlike @xmath67 .",
    "yajem @xcite is a tool capable of computing the complete medium modified fragmentation function given a particular path through the medium .",
    "for the radiative energy loss scenario ( rad ) , the medium needs to be characterized by a parameter @xmath68 which is linked to the thermodynamical properties of the medium by means of eq .",
    "( [ e - qhat ] ) , albeit with a different @xmath69 which again results from a best fit to pionic @xmath4 in central au - au collisions .",
    "the main physics assumption of the rad scenario yajem is that the evolution equations for parton branching can be solved with each parton acquiring additional virtuality while propagating through the medium .",
    "the gain of parton @xmath70 in virtuality @xmath71 is then given by    @xmath72    this requires that the parton evolution which takes place in momentum space is linked to the medium evolution in position space . in yajem , this link is done based on formation time arguments .",
    "the average lifetime of a virtual state @xmath73 coming from a parent state @xmath70 is computed as    @xmath74    and the actual formation time in a given event is be obtained from the probability distribution    @xmath75.\\ ] ]    based on this time information , the spatial position of partons in the medium is obtained by propagating them on an eikonal trajectory given by the shower - initiating parton ( thus neglecting the small transverse spread of partons in the shower ) .",
    "the medium - induced virtuality leads to additional branching and hence an energy transfer from high @xmath3 partons into the production of multiple partons at lower @xmath3 .",
    "for hadronization , the complete parton shower is processed using the lund model @xcite which is part of pythia @xcite .    due to an approximate scaling law identified in @xcite",
    ", it is sufficient to compute the line integral    @xmath76    in the medium to obtain the full medium - modified fragmentation function ( mmff ) @xmath77 for a given eikonal path of the shower - initiating parton .",
    "thus , for each event in the back - to - back mc code , yajem can provide the full mmff , thus this is the quantity we average after transforming it into a function of @xmath7 given the photon energy in the event .",
    "with the two different frameworks for parton - medium interaction and hadronization , we are in a position to compute the conditional yield on the away side given a photon trigger both for p - p and central au - au collisions . to exclude the region of very low @xmath0",
    ", we only consider hadrons above 0.5 gev .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - comp ] . note that there is a technical point to consider : in the asw calculation , hadronization is computed inside the back - to - back mc simulation and thus both the sampling of geometry and energy loss and the sampling of the fragmentation function is done with the same number of events . in the yajem calculation ,",
    "hadronization is not computed within the back - to - back mc code but within yajem and the full mmff is passed into the back - to - back simulation .",
    "thus , effectively the yajem calculation has a factor @xmath78100.000 more statistics and thus vanishing statistical errors whereas the asw calculation is limited in statistics at large @xmath7  that region , however , is not so relevant for the present paper .",
    "it is immediately clear from the figure that there is a dramatic difference between the expectations for @xmath12 for the two different scenarios . while the asw scenario shows only a moderate rise towards low @xmath7 , the yajem scenario exhibits a dramatic increase even above unity .",
    "however , both scenarios agree in the high @xmath7 region as expected  the depletion here is in essence the same physics that causes single hadron @xmath79 . while there is some small dependence on the photon momentum , to first order the dramatic differences between the scenarios are independent of the trigger range .",
    "let us first discuss the main feature , the different low @xmath7 behaviour . in any medium - modified shower picture",
    ", there is a sum rule  if there is to be a depletion of high @xmath0 hadrons in an in - medium shower as compared to a shower in vacuum , then energy conservation requires that this is compensated by an increase of low @xmath0 hadrons .",
    "thus , if the fragmentation function ratio is below unity in the high @xmath7 range , it must rise above unity at low @xmath7 .",
    "this is not so in the energy loss picture where energy is assumed to be distributed to extremely low momenta and large angles  here the ratio may stay below unity for any value of @xmath7 if the yield is extracted with a momentum cut and the angular restriction on the away side as outlined above .",
    "next , let us turn to the small rise of @xmath12 at low @xmath7 in the asw scenario .",
    "this is in essence a kinematical effect .",
    "for high @xmath7 , one reqires a hadron which has approximately ( modulo the intrinsic @xmath34 ) the full energy of the original parton . any small amount of energy loss will thus immediately lead to a dramatic suppression , and thus one is in essence observing here hadrons from partons which have not lost any energy .",
    "this is not so at low @xmath7  since the hadron energy is far from the primary parton energy in this region , there is some room for energy loss , and thus one observes events in which there was a moderate energy loss in addition to events in which the parton did not lose energy , and this is reflected in a rise .",
    "note that the rise is more pronounced for the higher trigger energy where there is even more room for energy loss . in any scenario in which energy loss and in - medium pathlength are strongly linked , as e.g. @xcite , this kinematical argument can be translated into a geometrical argument leading to a transition from surface emission ( no energy loss ) to volume emission ( moderate energy loss ) .",
    "however , if energy loss is a strongly fluctuating function of in - medium pathlength ( as in the asw scheme used here ) the geometrical interpretation of the kinematical argument breaks down .",
    "thus , there is a very clear distinction between the two physics pictures combined with a good insight into what causes the difference .",
    "we have computed @xmath12 the ratio of the per - trigger away side yield in central au - au collisions over p - p collisions given a photon trigger as a function @xmath7 .",
    "the away side yield is extracted in an angular region with @xmath6 around the direction back - to - back with the photon .",
    "@xmath80 shows a clear difference between a calculation under the assumption that energy is lost from a hard parton and redistributed in the medium or under the assumption that energy is transferred from hard partons to softer partons inside the shower during the in - medium shower evolution . in the case of energy loss",
    ", @xmath81 is true for all @xmath7 whereas for the medium - modified parton shower @xmath82 for small @xmath7 is unavoidable .",
    "preliminary data @xcite from both phenix and star for @xmath12 in @xmath1-hadron correlations show no indication of a raise of @xmath83 for any @xmath7 or any trigger momentum .",
    "if these results are confirmed , they would constitute strong evidence that the nature of the parton - medium interaction is such that energy lost from an initially hard parton is almost completely absorbed and redistributed in the medium and that pictures based on an in - medium evolution of the shower ( which are in principle more complete than energy loss pictures ) miss an essential physics process .",
    "i would like to thank b.  jacak , m.  connors , s.  mioduszewski and a.  hamed for interesting discussions and their time to explain to me some of the details of @xmath1-h correlation measurements .",
