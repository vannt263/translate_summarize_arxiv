    "charge and magnetic superstructures observed in many transition metal oxides , as e.g. in @xmath0 , where @xmath1,@xcite have stimulated an intensive search for explanation of origins of the phenomenon and its impact on physical properties of the systems .",
    "the subject has been analyzed primarily in the framework of various versions of the hubbard or _",
    "model.@xcite    an alternative approach based on the spinless falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) was proposed in ref.@xcite . within the space restricted to a large number of the simplest trial configurations",
    "the ground state diagrams have been found exactly showing how the chessboard phase evolves to phase separation with a change of doping .",
    "it appeared that quite large areas of the diagrams are occupied by stripe phases oriented either along one of the main crystallographic axes ( _ axial stripes _ ) , or along one of the main diagonals ( _ diagonal stripes _ ) .",
    "these findings were confirmed by rigorous studies.@xcite    the spinless fkm is simple enough to obtain controllable results for all values of the coupling constant .",
    "however , the model can deal only with charge ordered phases and it neglects magnetic properties . to overcome this shortcoming a generalized version of the spin - one - half fkm with a spin - dependent local term representing hund s first rule",
    "was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "an important role of the hund coupling in explaining magnetic properties of correlated electron systems was raised , e.g. in refs.@xcite , and specifically in applying to the fkm , in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , the model we deal with is very similar to the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model , that was also considered in the context of charge and magnetic superstructures in correlated electron systems@xcite .",
    "here we assume the simplest ising - type anisotropy of the hund coupling what enables us to examine the model rigorously .",
    "the anisotropy is relevant in systems , where spin flip processes have a minor meaning and stable magnetically ordered phases occur ( for more arguments see ref.@xcite ) .    the extended model is still oversimplified to describe all details of real materials .",
    "but , since it comprises only basic interactions , that are present in all materials , where both localized and itinerant electrons are relevant , we expect that its characteristics emerging from our calculations are quite universal .",
    "our expectations are justified by the fact , that phases similar to those we detected were also found by other authors studying different models and using quite different methods , as it was reported e.g. in ref.@xcite for a version of the hubbard model and in refs.@xcite for the ferromagnetic kondo ( or hund ) lattice model .    in ref.@xcite",
    "only some basic properties of the model in 2d were examined .",
    "farkaovk and cencarikov studied the model by means of the small - cluster exact - diagonalization calculations and an efficient numerical method for large clusters containing up to 64 lattice sites.@xcite they constructed phase diagrams , where they found a number of various types of charge and spin distributions , and observed a gradual reduction of the stability region of the non - polarized ( np ) phase in favor of the fully - polarized ( fp ) and partially polarized ( pp ) phases with an increase of the hund coupling and with an increase in the number of localized particles .",
    "the studies are interesting , as they enable to examine the model in a complementary way , but the obtained results are too general for making predictions on details of charge and spin ordering for a given set of model parameters .",
    "besides , there are some strange irregularities in their diagrams . for example , for small hund couplings or for small densities of both localized and itinerant particles , one can find the fp phase at some isolated positions , surrounded by np phases . and",
    "a lack of pp phases in a wide region of the diagram close to the chessboard af phase , especially for small @xmath2 , seems to be an artefact resultant from taking into considerations only clusters with even numbers of sites .",
    "a need for a clarification of this picture pushes us to examine the model more carefully . in our previous work we considered only 2d case",
    "and we used too small configurational space to detect many regularities .",
    "we merely noticed a few general tendencies for a formation of charge and/or spin ordered phases.@xcite here we expand upon our preceding work both to 1d and 2d systems and provide a thorough analysis of the ground state phase diagrams using a much larger set of admissible configurations .",
    "it allows us to notice some simple rules of formation of periodic phases ( as well as their mixtures ) not noticed in previous studies .",
    "the model hamiltonian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the nearest neighbor lattice sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are spin indices , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is an annihilation ( creation ) operator , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is an occupation number of itinerant(localized ) electrons .",
    "the on - site interaction between localized and itinerant electrons is represented by two coupling constants : @xmath13 , which is spin - independent coulomb - type and @xmath2 , which is spin - dependent and reflects the hund s rule force .",
    "the hopping amplitude @xmath14 is set equal to one , so we measure all energies in units of @xmath14 .    double occupancy of the localized electrons is forbidden , implying the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath15 between two _ f - electrons _ is infinite . consequently , at a given site the _ f - electron _ occupancy is assumed to be @xmath16 and the @xmath17 occupancy to be @xmath18 .",
    "so there are 3 states per site allowed for the _ f - electrons _",
    "( @xmath19 ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and 4 states per site allowed for the _ d - electrons _",
    "( @xmath24 ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 ; @xmath29 ) .",
    "all single - ion interactions included in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) preserve states of localized electrons , i.e. the itinerant electrons traveling through the lattice change neither occupation numbers nor spins of the localized ones .",
    "then @xmath30=0 $ ] for all @xmath5 and @xmath31 , so the local occupation number is conserved .",
    "the localized electrons play the role of an external , charge and spin dependent potential for the itinerant electrons .",
    "this external potential is `` adjusted '' by annealing , so the total energy of the system attains its minimum . in other words , there is a feedback between the subsystems of localized and itinerant electrons , and this is the feedback that is responsible for the long - period ordered arrangements of the localized electrons , and consequently for the formation of various charge and/or spin distributions at low temperatures .    in the next section",
    "we shortly describe our calculation scheme , then , in the third section we present two kinds of phase diagrams referring to pure magnets ( section a ) and diluted magnets ( section b ) .",
    "the last section contains summary and discussion .",
    "we used rpdm first in our studies of the spinless 1d fkm in ref.@xcite and then also in ref.@xcite . within the method ,",
    "calculations are performed for infinite systems but with a restriction to periodic phases , with periods not exceeded a certain value and their mixtures . then , we can investigate both periodic phases and phase separation and segregation .",
    "we emphasize that the rpdm is by no means a mean field approach and the calculations refer to infinite systems , not to finite clusters .",
    "so we do not need to deal with neither boundary nor finite size effects .",
    "energies ( per site ) of all phases we consider here are evaluated with a very high and controllable accuracy . for small period phases with",
    "no more than @xmath32 lattice sites in an unit cell energy bands are given by analytical expressions @xcite , and the precision is limited merely by a selection of a grid in the @xmath33 . for large period phases some very small errors , resulting from numerical diagonalization of matrices of size of the number of lattice sites in an unit cells may additionally enter .",
    "the details of the current work are as follows .",
    "we performed calculations in 1d and 2d ( the square lattice ) for @xmath34 and j changing from 0.2 up to @xmath35 and within the configurational space restricted to all periodic phases with unit cells containing up to 12 lattice sites for pure magnets and up to 8 for diluted magnets .",
    "to assure stability of the phases appearing on the diagrams , we constructed _ the grand canonical phase diagrams _ first ( see ref.@xcite for more detailed discussion of the stability issue ) in the plane of the chemical potentials .",
    "then we transformed the diagrams into _ the canonical phase diagrams _ in the plane of densities of localized ( @xmath36 ) and itinerant ( @xmath37 ) electrons . by applying this procedure",
    "one automatically includes all mixtures of the phases .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams are quite sensitive to values of the interaction parameters @xmath13 and @xmath2 . in general",
    ", they have a rich structure composed of various families of phases .    in order to calculate the gibbs thermodynamic potential , we first determined the electronic band structure for the itinerant electrons for each candidate periodic phase .",
    "we employed a sufficiently tiny grid in the brillouin zone ( up to @xmath38 momentum points in 1d and up to @xmath39 in 2d for each bandstructure ) .",
    "this required us to diagonalize up to @xmath40 matrices in the pure magnet case and up to @xmath41 matrices in the diluted magnet case at each discrete momentum point in the brillouin zone and results in at most 12 and 8 different energy bands in pure and and diluted magnet case , respectively . hence",
    ", our calculations can be viewed as finite size but very large cluster calculations with cluster sizes ranging in 1d from @xmath42 up to @xmath43 in the pure magnet and from @xmath42 up to @xmath44 in the diluted magnet case , whereas in 2d from @xmath45 up to @xmath46 in the pure magnet and from @xmath45 up to @xmath47 in the diluted magnet case , depending on the number of sites in the unit cell ( @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is equal to the number of unit cells and @xmath50 denotes a number of lattice sites in unit cell for a given configuration of localized electrons ) .",
    "we performed all the calculations separately for spin up and down itinerant electrons .",
    "the eigenvalues of the band structure are summed up to determine the ground - state energy for each density of the electrons .",
    "then , the gibbs thermodynamical potential for a given configuration @xmath51 is calculated for all possible values of the chemical potentials @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the conduction and localized electrons , respectively , through the formula @xmath54 where the symbol @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) denotes energy eigenvalues of a band structure attributed to spin up ( down ) itinerant electrons for a given configuration @xmath51 of localized electrons .",
    "it appears that only a small part of the initial candidate phases can be found in the ground - state phase diagram .",
    "the actual number depends on @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath50 but the rate drops drastically with an increase of @xmath50 .",
    "we find that for the values of the parameters we considered it is less than 10% in 1d and less than 2% in 2d case .",
    "in this paper we present two types of the ground - state phase diagrams . the first type ( _ pure magnets _ ) demonstrates only magnetic order , as it corresponds to the case @xmath57 ( each site is occupied by exactly one _ f - electron _ ) in the plane @xmath58 .",
    "and the second type ( _ diluted magnets _ ) demonstrates both a magnetic and charge order in the plane @xmath59 for fixed values @xmath2 and @xmath13 .",
    "the diagrams show ground state configurations of the _ f - electrons _ both in 1d and 2d for representative values of the model parameters . for a pure magnet we selected @xmath60 , @xmath61 in 1d and @xmath62 , @xmath61 in 2d . and for the diluted magnet @xmath63 , @xmath64 in 1d and @xmath60 , @xmath64 in the 2d .      in the pure magnetic diagrams the ferromagnetic phase ( f ) is stable for @xmath37 close to 0 or 2 and the region of the stability increases with @xmath2 , whereas along the line @xmath65 ( the half - filling ) the simplest af phase is stable",
    ". now , the most interesting story concerns a way of transforming between the two extreme phases with a change of @xmath37 .    obviously , the process depends on @xmath2 , but it is the density @xmath37 that plays a crucial role in determining a spin order .",
    "namely , if @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are relative prime numbers , then the period @xmath69 of a stable phase in 1d is equal to @xmath68 or a multiple of @xmath68 ( i.e. @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) . consequently , if @xmath72 and @xmath68 is an odd number , then the system can not be an antiferromagnetic ( af ) , but ferrimagnetic ( fi ) .",
    "indeed , we observe both fi and af phases distributed over the whole region between the f and the simplest af phases .",
    "this is in contrast to the results reported in ref.@xcite , where many fi phases ( named as partially polarized pp ) were missed in 1d because only systems containing even numbers of lattice sites were taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "our af phases are consistent with np ( non polarized ) phases reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "it appears that not only the period is determined by @xmath37 .",
    "we found a remarkable feature concerning the number @xmath73 of changes of the _ f - electron _ spin orientation ( from up to down or from down to up ) calculated per site . if in the diagram displayed in fig .",
    "1 we move up along a vertical line ( i.e. when @xmath2 is fixed ) then @xmath73 of subsequent phases increases with the density @xmath37 .",
    "what is more , for @xmath74 in almost all cases @xmath75 .",
    "then the number of itinerant electrons is equal to the number of pairs of localized electrons with magnetic moments oriented oppositely .",
    "physically this rule means that each moving electron is somehow associated with an exactly one abrupt change of the potential resulting from the localized electrons . in other words ,",
    "the minimum energy is attained when the number of moving electrons and the number of changes of the potential acting on them are equal to each other .",
    "the rule can be noticed by direct inspection , e.g. looking along the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 ( for @xmath76 ) . in this",
    "case unit cells of phases located between f and the simplest af phases are displayed in table i.    .unit cells of phases located along the dashed line @xmath76 in fig . 1 and electron densities @xmath77 corresponding to them . [ cols=\"^,>,^,>,^,>,^,>,^,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     obviously , for small enough @xmath37 , where the f phase is stable , one has @xmath78 and for @xmath65 , where the simpest af phase is stable , one has @xmath79 .",
    "so it is clear that in 1d the density of itinerant electrons @xmath37 determines not only a periodicity ( within an accuracy to a small natural number multiplier ) of arrangement of the _ f - electrons _ but also strongly influences a relative distribution of spins up and down inside unit cells .    in 2d",
    "the process of transformation from f to af with an increase of @xmath37 can be divided into two stages ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . first",
    ", anisotropic quasi one - dimensional structures composed of parallel ferromagnetic chains oriented along one of the main lattice axis are formed .",
    "we call the area _ the region of axial stripes with ferromagnetic chains _ ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "for @xmath80 this region ends up with the simplest phase belonging to this class , that is composed of ferromagnetic chains with alternating spin direction . in our considerations",
    "this is the very special phase , as it can be also viewed as composed of the simplest antiferromagnetic chains along the perpendicular axis .",
    "this is why we call the phase af - f / a , to underline that it is the antiferromagnetic phase composed of ferro-/antiferro- magnetic chains ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "above the stability region of af - f / a a majority of phases ( see fig .",
    "3 ) are composed of either only the simplest antiferromagnetic chains ( for @xmath81 ) or with an admixture of ferromagnetic chains ( for @xmath82 ) and in the intermediate interval of @xmath83 also of ferrimagnetic chains .",
    "some phases found in this region can be viewed as composed of diagonal ferromagnetic chains oriented along the diagonal ( 1,1 ) direction .",
    "and the final stage of the transformation of the phases with an increase of @xmath37 is the simplest af phase with antiferromagnetic chains located along the both main lattice axes .",
    "it appears that the transformation from f to the simplest af phase is accompanied with an increase of a rate of localization of itinerant electrons , as with an increase of @xmath37 a mobility of the _ d - electrons _ becomes more and more restricted when the half - filling is approached . for small @xmath37 , where the f phase is stable , the _ f - electrons _",
    "act on the _ d - electrons _ as an uniform , site independent external field that do nt disturb their movements .",
    "then , in the region of _ axial stripes with ferromagnetic chains _ the _ d - electrons _ can move easily but only along these chains , as along the perpendicular direction an external potential ( coming from the _ f - electrons _ ) alternates by taking two different values @xmath84 and @xmath85 what causes scattering of the _ d - electrons_.    the af - f / a phase is an optimal one with respect to the transport of the _ d - electrons _ through the lattice but only along one direction .",
    "maybe it is related to the optimum doping reported in some materials , when there is a balance between a density of current carriers and their mobility over the lattice .",
    "obviously , one should be cautious when trying to relate the results obtained for such a simple model with situations observed in real materials , but it is interesting that the optimum doping observed here is attained for @xmath37 close to 0.5 , what corresponds to the special case of quarter filling .    a further increase of @xmath37 causes a complete vanish of ferromagnetic chains for small values of @xmath2 ( @xmath81 ) and a gradual decrease of their number for not too small @xmath2 .",
    "it means that the _ d - electrons _",
    "meet more and more potential barriers in any direction what makes them more and more localized .",
    "obviously , the rate of localization becomes higher when @xmath2 is large .",
    "here we point out another interesting feature of the model .",
    "namely , the critical value @xmath86 below which phases containing antiferromagnetic chains are stable increases with @xmath2 , so the range of densities @xmath37 where the _ d - electrons _ become more localized shrinks , but at the same time a rate of the localization becomes more pronounced .",
    "it means that for large @xmath2 the _ d - electrons _",
    "pass from a delocalized to localized regime within a relatively small interval of their densities .",
    "and the reported results suggest that in the limit of infinite @xmath2 the interval between the conducting f and insulating af phase tends to zero ( close to the line @xmath65 ) .",
    "this may be regarded as an analogy to the famous nagaoka problem studied within the hubbard model .",
    "let us now analyse a phase diagram corresponding to a diluted magnet , where both spin and charge orderings are relevant .",
    "the diagram is displayed in the ( @xmath87 ) plane for @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the 1d case ( see fig.4 ) and for @xmath60 and @xmath64 in the 2d case ( see fig .",
    "the maximum period c of allowed phases in the two cases is equal to 8 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath2 were chosen to be characteristic intermediate value representatives .",
    "we found both in the 1d and 2d diagrams that a majority of periodic phases are located along one of the following three lines : @xmath88 , @xmath89 or the diagonal @xmath90 .",
    "the first two mentioned lines correspond to mixed valence regimes .    both antiferro- and ferrimagnetic arrangements of the _ f - electrons",
    "_ are found in the whole range of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in 1d and 2d . in 1d unit cells of phases located along the line @xmath88 are composed of blocks of spins up ( + ) and down @xmath91 , whereas the pairs of opposite spins @xmath92 are stable along the @xmath89 line .",
    "unit cells of phases located along the diagonal @xmath90 have the most homogeneous types of structures .",
    "a typical example of the transformation can be noticed e.g. for @xmath93 , where the unit cell @xmath94 transforms first to @xmath95 and then to @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .    in 2d ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) ,",
    "phases located along the @xmath88 line are composed of ferromagnetic ( or diluted ferromagnetic ) and nonmagnetic chains oriented along one of the lattice axis ( e.g. d1 in fig .",
    "phases belonging to this family are marked on the diagram in fig .",
    "5 by straight line segments .",
    "it means that they are stable over finite intervals of band fillings .    on the other hand , phases located along the @xmath89 line",
    "are composed of antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic chains . and",
    "phases located along the diagonal @xmath90 can be viewed as composed of diluted ferro- or antiferromagnetic chains ( d2 , d3 and d4 in fig .",
    "the highest symmetry has the phase d3 placed at the central point of the diagram ( @xmath99 , @xmath65 ) .",
    "it is interesting , that phases located along the diagonal @xmath90 are insulating for any values of the model parameters we examined , as they have gaps at their fermi levels , whereas phases found along the line @xmath88 have no energy gaps at their fermi levels . and",
    "phases located along the line @xmath89 have no gaps for small values of @xmath13 , but they do have gaps for @xmath13 large enough .",
    "this is consistent with the conjecture that the _ d - electrons _ can easily ( i.e. without scattering ) move along ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic chains , but along antiferromagnetic chains their mobility becomes suppressed",
    "since the diagrams reported in this paper were constructed within the restricted space of periodic configurations , they can serve only as skeletons of the full diagrams . here ,",
    "similarly to what was found in the case of the simplest fkm,@xcite most of the diagrams areas are occupied by mixtures of various phases , occasionally penetrated by periodic phases .    with an increase of the maximum period @xmath50 of admissible configurations more and more periodic phases with higher periods",
    "replace some of the mixtures on the canonical phase diagrams . however , we observed that the higher period phases do not distroy the diagrams structure , i.e. charge and spin distributions of these new phases follow the same rules that we already detected for low period phases .",
    "so our conjecture is that the full diagrams will be filled with phases of which charge and magnetic order can be easily predicted ( for a given set of the coupling parmeters and densities @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) . of course , working within the rpdm we are not able to prove the statement rigorously , but since it appears to be quite reasonable , we expect that it can be established definitely by other methods",
    ".    in the limiting case of @xmath50 tending to infinity not only periodic , but also aperiodic phases may happen to appear on the diagrams .",
    "it is not clear if some mixtures of low period phases survive in the central region of the full phases diagram .",
    "but it is quite possible , as in the simplest spinless fkm such phases are proven to have the lowest energy in the large @xmath13 limit @xcite",
    ".    the rules of formation of the phases we detected from an analysis of the diagrams do not allow to determine unambiguously the ground state charge and spin arrangement for given values of @xmath101 , @xmath100 , @xmath13 and @xmath2 , but they provide enough information needed for a rough prediction of what sorts of phases appear on the digrams and where they are located .    in the pure magnetic case ( @xmath102 ) the f",
    "phase is stable for the densities @xmath100 such that @xmath103 or @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is an increasing function of @xmath2 . within the interval of @xmath2 ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 the function @xmath105 increases from about 0.2 to slightly above 0.6 in 1d ( see fig . 1 ) and from about 0.1 to around 0.55 in 2d ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the results are consistent with the data obtained in ref.@xcite .        \\2 .",
    "for @xmath2 small and @xmath107 , with @xmath68 being an even integer , periodic phases are antiferromagnetic , whereas for @xmath68 being an odd number they are ferrimagnetic with the lowest possible magnetization ; for large @xmath2 higher magnetizations states become stable .        the rules confirm a presence of quite well organized phase diagram structure not revealed in previous studies . in fact , some of the details shown in ref.@xcite as , for example , arrangements of spins in a certain number of phases are in agreement with these rules . however , since only rings composed of even numbers of sites and even numbers of electrons were investigated in,@xcite a number of fi phases were missed .    driving mechanisms that are behind the detected rules are still not fully understood .",
    "recently brydon and gulacsi @xcite discovered that competitive roles of the forward - scattering and back - scattering of itinerant electrons can explain observed richness of the spinless fkm diagrams .",
    "we hope that studies carried out along the similar ways could be also performed for the extended version of the fkm with the hund coupling and elucidate the rules we observed .    in 2d",
    "the situation is more complex and we were not able to find out as many precise rules as in the 1d case . even though , our phase diagram shows more regularities than those of reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "first of all , we noticed that all phases appeared in the diagram are composed of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , and for intermediate values of @xmath2 also ferrimagnetic chains parallel to each other .",
    "obviously , the phases with only ferromagnetic chains have one - dimensional unit cells and they form axial stripes .",
    "these phases occur within an interval of electron densities @xmath109",
    "neighboring to those for which the f phase is stable . for @xmath80",
    "the interval ends with the simplest phase belonging to the family , the af - f / a phase ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , that separates regions of axial stripes from those of containing antiferromagnetic chains ( ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic chains could be also present for not too small values of @xmath2 ) .",
    "so for @xmath109 out of the stability regions of f , af - f / a and axial stripes almost all phases are composed of either exclusively antiferromagnetic chains or with an admixture of ferri- and ferromagnetic chains .",
    "some of them containing only ferro- and antiferromagnetic chains are ferrimagnetic .",
    "an analysis of diluted magnets diagrams ( see figs",
    ". 4 - 6 ) also permits us to fix some rules of charge and spin formation and its evolution with a change of the densities @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "here we focused on the most representative three families of the phases .",
    "one of them consists of phases located along the main diagonal .",
    "this family corresponds to the most homogeneous phases relevant for the spinless fkm , and this is the only family of diluted periodic phases which is left in the limit of large @xmath13 ( if we keep @xmath2 considerable smaller than @xmath13 ) .",
    "phases belonging to this family are characterized by the most uniform charge distribution but not necessarily the most uniform magnetic distribution . in 2d",
    "all but one particular phase have a form of sloped stripes composed of parallel lines of ferromagnetic chains ( see conf .",
    "d2 and d4 in fig . 6 ) .",
    "the only exception is the most symmetric , antiferromagnetic chessboard phase d3 placed in the center of the diagram .",
    "the phase has two - dimensional unit cell of size @xmath111 and is composed of diluted ferromagnetic lines ( see fig .",
    "two other characteristic families refer to mixed valence regimes , for which either the condition @xmath112 or @xmath113 is fulfilled .",
    "these phases are ground states only for small and intermediate values of @xmath13 ( and @xmath114 ) . in 1d",
    ", it appears that unit cells of phases belonging the first category ( @xmath112 ) are built of blocks of spins up separated by pairs of empty sites from blocks of spins down . on the other hand , unit cells of phases belonging to the second category ( @xmath113 ) consist of empty sites separated by pairs of oppositely oriented spins ( @xmath115 ) .    in 2d",
    ", all phases coming from the both mixed valence categories have the form of axial stripes .",
    "so they have the same type of charge ordering .",
    "nevertheless their magnetic orders are clearly different , as phases that belong to the first class are composed of ferromagnetic chains ( e.g. d1 in fig .",
    "6 ) , whereas phases for which the condition @xmath113 is fulfilled are composed of antiferromagnetic chains ( e.g. d5 in fig . 6 ) .",
    "our current studies confirm findings reported in ref.@xcite that show that the compromise between kinetic energy of the _ d - electrons _ and their interaction with the _ f - electrons _ imposes formation of superstructures with shapes of stripes .",
    "kinetic energy tends to spread out the _ d - electrons _ uniformly over the lattice , but due to the presence of localized magnetic ions a kind of _ d - electron _ density deformation must occur . obviously , the deformation has to be conjugated with an arrangement of the _ f - electrons_. apparently , the simplest departures from the homogeneity that are preferred have the form of axial or diagonal stripes .",
    "perhaps the most important conclusion emerging from this work is that the observed rules of formation of the phases suggest a possibility of manipulation of positional arrangements of magnetic ions diluted in the system and also their magnetic alignment with a change of doping .",
    "for example , one should be able to tune a modulation of charge and/or spin ( stripes width ) .",
    "if it can be done in a controllable way , then in systems that can be described by the model it would be possible to change gradually an orientation of stripe phases ( between axial and diagonal ) and to change magnetic order along chains ( from ferro- through ferri- up to antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "we hope the results will motivate some new experimental work focusing on searching relationships between density of current carriers ( electrons or holes ) and observed charge and/or magnetic superstructure . according to our findings",
    "complicated ordering patterns should emerge from on - site interactions of localized and moving electrons and a simplified version of hund s rule .",
