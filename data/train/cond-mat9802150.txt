    "the matrix product method ( mpm ) is a variational approach appropiate to study the ground state and excitations of a variety of one - dimensional lattice systems in condensed matter and statistical mechanics .",
    "the theoretical and experimental interest of these systems has grown spectacularly in the last years , due to the discovery of interesting and unexpected physical properties in spin chains and ladders .    the basic idea behind the mpm is the construction of the ground state and excitations of 1d or quasi 1d systems in a recursive way , by relating the states of the system with length @xmath0 to that of length @xmath1 .",
    "this simple idea has appeared in the past in different places .",
    "first of all , in the wilson s real space renormalization group the 1d - lattice is built up by the addition of a single site at every rg step @xcite .",
    "this procedure is also used in the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) of white @xcite .",
    "other source of the mpm is the well known aklt state of the spin 1 chain @xcite .",
    "this is a simple but non trivial example of a matrix product state , which has motivated various generalizations as the ones of klumper et al @xcite , ostlund and rommer @xcite , etc .",
    "we shall follow in this paper the formulation of the mpm due to the latter authors , which is based on the analysis of the fixed point structure of the dmrg ground state in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "a closely related approach is that of fannes et al @xcite .",
    "the mpm offers an alternative formulation of the dmrg method in the regime where the latter reaches a fixed point after many rg iterations @xcite .    whereas the dmrg is a purely numerical method",
    ", the mpm offers the possibility of an analytical approach to elucidate the actual structure of the ground state ( gs ) and excitations .",
    "the mpm is a standard variational method which determines the variational parameters by minimizing the gs energy .",
    "minimization problems are in general harder than diagonalization ones . in this respect",
    "the mpm is so far less performant than the dmrg .",
    "however we believe that the analytical insights gained with the mpm could be used to boost the numerical precision and applications of both the mpm and the dmrg .    in this paper",
    "we apply the mpm to the 2-leg spin ladder .",
    "spin ladders with diagonal couplings have been studied with the mpm of klumper et al in ref .",
    "spin ladders were first studied as theoretical labs to test ideas concerning the crossover from 1d to 2d , with the surprising result that this crossover is far from being smooth : the even and odd ladders display quite different properties converging only when the number of legs goes to infinity ( for an introduction to the subject see @xcite ) .",
    "even spin ladders are spin liquids with a finite spin gap and finite spin correlation length , while odd spin ladders belong to the same universality class than the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain , which has no gap and the correlations decay algebraically .",
    "another reason to study ladder systems is that materials actually exists with that structure and hence the theoretical predictions can in principle be compared with experimental data concerning the spectrum , susceptibility , etc .",
    "we study in this paper five different spin ladders characterized by their local spin @xmath2 and 3/2 and the signs of the exchange of coupling constants along the legs @xmath3 and the rungs @xmath4 .    in the case of the spin 1/2 ladders we discuss the following topics : i ) the rvb picture of the antiferromagnetic ladder , ii ) the equivalence between the ladder state and the haldane state of the spin 1 chain , and iii ) the duality properties relating the different magnetic structures .    in the case of the spin 1 ladder",
    "we show that the long range topological order characteristic of isolated spin 1 chains disappears and the string correlator decays exponentially with a finite correlation length .",
    "the study of the spin 3/2 ladder motivates the definition of an aklt state characterized in terms of 9-j symbols .",
    "we compute gs energy densities , spin correlation lengths and string order parameters and compare our results with those existing in the current literature .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the mpm . in section iii",
    "we particularize the mpm to systems which are rotational invariant , where the use of group theory leads to a simplification of the formalism . in section",
    "iv we present our numerical results concerning five different spin ladders .",
    "in section v we summarize our results and present some prospects of our work .",
    "there are 3 appendices which contain technical details or proofs of results presented in the main body of the paper .",
    "some of the results presented in this section are known and can be found in references @xcite .",
    "we also present a full account of the formulas and derivations used in reference @xcite where the mpm was compared with the dmrg method in the case of the antiferromagnetic spin 1 chain .",
    "let us consider a spin chain or a ladder @xmath5 with open boundary conditions , where @xmath0 denotes the number of sites of a chain or the number of rungs of a ladder . to describe the low energy properties of @xmath5 one introduces a collection of @xmath6 states @xmath7 , which form an orthonormal basis , i.e. @xmath8 . in the dmrg these states are the most probable ones to contribute to the gs of the superblock @xmath9 of length @xmath10 , formed by adding two sites ( or rungs ) @xmath11 , and a mirror image @xmath12 to the original lattice @xmath13 .",
    "the basic assumption of the mpm is that the basis associated with @xmath14 and @xmath15 are related in a simple manner by the equation    @xmath16 \\ ;     \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 denotes a complete set of @xmath18 states associated to the @xmath19 site ( resp .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) has to be supplemented with the initial data @xmath20 .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 $ ] are the variational parameters of the mpm , and their determination is the central problem one has to solve .",
    "this is done by the standard variational method .",
    "the important point about eq.([1 ] ) is that @xmath21 $ ] does not depend on @xmath0 .",

    "the quantities @xmath27 $ ] represent a total of @xmath28 variables .",
    "we shall assume that all of them may be non vanishing .",
    "the normalization constraints ( [ 2 ] ) represent a total of @xmath29 constraints ( @xmath6 coming from the diagonal terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 coming from the off - diagonal ones ) . on the other hand one can rotate the basis of states @xmath32 by an element of the orthogonal group @xmath33 reducing by @xmath31 the number of independent mpm variables . the total number of variational degrees of freedom , @xmath34 ,",
    "is then given by ,    @xmath35    we show in appendix a that the set of @xmath21 $ ] belongs , to the grassmanian manifold ,    @xmath36    as an exercise one can check that the dimension of ( [ 4 ] ) coincides with @xmath34 given in ( [ 3 ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite eq.([1 ] ) is used to generate an ansatz for the gs of periodic chains . in this paper",
    "we shall rather use this eq . to generate states with open boundary conditions , in the spirit of the dmrg .",
    "we shall show below that the set @xmath37 correspond to ground states with different boundary conditions .",
    "the use of open boundary conditions leads to a simplification of the mpm which is very close to the more abstract formalism proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us use eq.([1 ] ) to compute the expectation values of local operators in a recursive way .",
    "we shall first consider a local operator @xmath38 acting at the position @xmath39 of the lattice .",
    "it is easy to get from ( [ 1 ] ) the expectation value ,    @xmath40    @xmath41    where    @xmath42 \\ ; a_{\\alpha',\\beta'}[s ]   \\label{6}\\ ] ]    @xmath43 \\ ; \\ ; a_{\\alpha',\\beta'}[s ' ]   \\;\\ ;   \\langle s   | { \\cal o } | s ' \\rangle \\label{7}\\ ] ]    @xmath44 can be identified with @xmath45 .",
    "eqs.([5],[6],[7 ] ) suggest to interpret the expectation value @xmath46 as a vector labeled by the pair @xmath47 , in which case @xmath44 and @xmath48 become @xmath49 matrices . upon iteration of (",

    "eqs ( [ 5],[9 ] ) imply that @xmath44 behaves as a shift operator by one lattice space .",
    "the basic properties of @xmath44 follow from the normalization condition ( [ 2 ] ) which can be expressed as ,    @xmath54    which implies that @xmath44 has a eigenvalue equal to 1 .",
    "let us call @xmath55 the right eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue .",
    "eq.([10 ] ) can be written in matrix notation as ,    @xmath56    on the other hand , let @xmath57 denote the left eigenvector of @xmath44 corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 , i.e.    @xmath58    a convenient normalization of @xmath57 is given by    @xmath59    for later use we shall diagonalize @xmath44 as follows ,    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the right and left eigenvectors of @xmath44 with eigenvalue @xmath63 .",
    "as a matter of fact all the remaining eigenvalues of @xmath44 are less than one , i.e. @xmath64 .    in the limit @xmath65 one gets ,    @xmath66    the delta function on the r.h.s . of this eq .",
    "means that the local operators @xmath67 acting in the bulk , do not modify the boundary conditions associated to the various choices of @xmath68 .    assuming that @xmath44 is invertible",
    ", one can rewrite eq.([15 ] ) in the following manner ,    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is defined as    @xmath71    observe that @xmath72 . the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ 16 ] ) is nothing but a spatial ordered product of local operators @xmath70 , which is reminiscent of the radial ordered product that appears in conformal field theory .",
    "this connection supports the interpretation of @xmath44 as an euclidean version of the shift operator . under this viewpoint",
    "the states @xmath55 and @xmath57 appear as incoming @xmath73 and outgoing vacua @xmath74 that are left invariant by the shift operator @xmath44 .",
    "we have shown above that the mpm leads in the thermodynamic limit to a sort of discretized field theory characterized by a shift or spatial transfer operator @xmath44 and local operators @xmath70 .",
    "we can now try to exploit these interpretation to extract some physical quantities .",
    "first of all let us consider the correlator of two operators @xmath75 and @xmath76 . from ( [ 14],[15 ] )",
    "one has ,    @xmath77    in the limit when @xmath78 the sum over @xmath79 is dominated by the highest eigenvalue @xmath80 of @xmath44 for which the corresponding matrix elements @xmath81 and @xmath82 are non zero .",
    "if @xmath83 one gets a finite correlation lenght @xmath84 given by the formula ,    @xmath85    in the case where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are both the spin operator @xmath88 , it turns out that the matrix element latexmath:[$\\langle \\rho | \\widehat { { \\bf s } }     ranged with a finite spin correlation length @xmath84 given by the formula ( [ 19 ] ) with @xmath90 .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath84 does indeed occur for mp ansatzs which preserve the rotational invariance .",
    "however if the latter is broken , as in a neel like state , then @xmath84 may become infinite .",
    "in section iii we shall give a formula to compute @xmath84 in the case of rotational invariant mp ansatzs .",
    "another interesting application of ( [ 16 ] ) is provided by the computation of the string order parameter .",
    "a spin 1 chain has a long range topological order ( lrto ) characterized by a non vanishing value of a non local operator @xmath91 defined as follows @xcite ,    @xmath92    the aklt state has @xmath93 , while the spin 1 antiferromagnetic spin chain has @xmath94 @xcite . from eq.([15 ] ) we deduce the following expression for ( [ 20 ] ) ,    @xmath95    in appendix c we show that the operator @xmath96 has an eigenvalue equal to 1 .",

    "let us suppose we have a translational invariant hamiltonian of the form ,    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is an on site ( rung ) operator while @xmath103 couples two nearest neighbour sites ( rungs ) .",

    "eq.([25 ] ) can be conveniently written in matrix notation as    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is a vector with components @xmath110 .",
    "iterating ( [ 27 ] ) one gets    @xmath111    the geometric series in @xmath44 can be sumed up and due to the eigenvalue equal to 1 it contributes a term proportional to @xmath0 , i.e.    @xmath112    this eq .",
    "implies that all the states @xmath113 have the same energy density in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. @xmath114 .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the mpm leads to a superblock of the form @xmath131 , rather than to the standard superblock @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall apply the mpm to the 2-leg spin ladder with a spin @xmath141 at each site of the chain .",
    "the collection @xmath113 will be given by the set @xmath142 ) of states with total spin @xmath143 and third component @xmath128 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we have only considered one state per angular momenta @xmath143 and @xmath128 . this will allow us to show more clearly the analytic structure of the mpm , which can later on be numerically improved by considering multiplicity .",

    "there is however a more efficient way to do this by using group theory .",
    "the application of the wigner - eckart theorem will allow us to express all the results in terms of reduced matrix elements of the operators involved as well as the @xmath159-symbols .",
    "in our derivations we shall follow the same steps as in section ii , leaving the technical details to appendix b.      let us denote by @xmath160 an irreducible tensor of total angular momentum @xmath161 , whose components are labeled by @xmath162 .",
