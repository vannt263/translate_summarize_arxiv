    "the elementary resources in quantum information theory are quantum entanglement and classical communication . by means of them ,",
    "one unknown quantum state(``qubit '' ) could be transmitted from a sender(``alice '' ) to a receiver(``bob '' ) , i.e. , the process of teleportation @xcite , which indicates that people have found a new way to broadcast information and shows better prospect than the traditional technique @xcite .",
    "similar to teleportation , the remote state preparation(rsp ) is assumed that alice completely knows the state to be prepared by bob , who will know part of the knowledge on this state at most ( in many situations he even knows nothing about this state ) .",
    "the essential concern for teleportation and rsp is the trade - off between entanglement and classical communication .",
    "it is clear that two bits of forward classical communication and one bit of entanglement per teleported qubit are both necessary and sufficient during the process of teleportation .",
    "however when it turns to the rsp , whether the amount of both quantum and classical resources could be reduced and how the trade - off between entanglement and classical communication will change has been checked by many authors .",
    "for instance , pati @xcite has shown that a qubit chosen from equatorial or polar great circles on a bloch sphere can be remotely prepared with one classical bit from alice to bob if they share one bit of entanglement , which implies that the lower bound of classical communication @xcite is possibly reached .",
    "many other techniques @xcite about faithful rsp have been constructed , including both exact and asymptotical methods .",
    "unlike the conventional disposal , recently , ye _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a new scheme in which non - maximally entangled state plays the role of quantum channel , instead of epr @xcite singlet .",
    "they showed that any pure quantum state can be faithfully prepared by using finite classical bits and any previously shared non - maximally entangled state .",
    "an explicit procedure is given by @xcite .",
    "the scheme @xcite of many ensembles of states remotely prepared by using minimum classical bits and previously shared entangled state , including all the ensembles in two - dimensional case , has been also established .    in this paper",
    "we study a rsp protocol , in which a series of non - maximally entangled states are employed as the quantum channel , each of which will correspond to one area where the transmitted state lies . in section",
    "ii we describe this scheme and demonstrate that the prior fidelity expected can be achieved , provided that enough number of entangled states is supplied and bob knows the content of @xmath1 . in section iii",
    "we provide several techniques to reduce the entanglement resource for the deterministic fidelity , we try to find out the lowest expense .",
    "we compare the present work with several former techniques , in order to represent different characteristics of rsp protocols in section iv . finally , we present our conclusion and some open problems .",
    "the protocol is characterized as follows .",
    "a pure qubit state and its orthonormal state have the form @xmath2 here , two real parameters are valued in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which define the qubit @xmath5 as a point on the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "alice plans to transmit this state @xmath5 to bob who has the knowledge of @xmath1 . here",
    "we define that @xmath6,n=0,1,2, ... $],and @xmath7 $ ] which is the expected fidelity with which alice transmits qubit @xmath8 to bob .",
    "when @xmath9 $ ] , the prior - entangled state shared by alice and bob is assumed like this : @xmath10 notice that we do nt normalize the above state for convenience and the same reason is applicable to all following cases .",
    "as the first step , alice performs a unitary operation @xmath11 then alice measures her particle with basis @xmath12 and broadcast 1 bit to inform bob about the result of her measurement . after receiving the information bob will do nothing if he gets 0 or @xmath13 if he gets 1 .",
    "therefore he could always get such state @xmath14    second , bob performs the cnot gate on @xmath15 and an ancilla state @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is some constant which keeps @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the + reduced density matrix of b then becomes @xmath21\\\\ & & [ \\left\\langle0\\right|+\\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-a_{n+1})e^{-i\\varphi}y^\\ast\\left\\langle1\\right|]\\\\ & & + [ y\\left|0\\right\\rangle+\\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-a_{n+1})e^{i\\varphi}\\left|1\\right\\rangle]\\\\ & & [ y^\\ast\\left\\langle0\\right|+\\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-a_{n+1})e^{-i\\varphi}\\left\\langle1\\right|].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath22 , the basis @xmath12 can be reexpressed as @xmath23 so @xmath24 is written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 hence , we get @xmath27 from the above equation , one can read off the fidelity of @xmath5 @xmath28 where @xmath29 according to @xmath9 $ ] , we find @xmath30 it can be easily found that @xmath31 $ ] , which implies that @xmath32 is the @xmath33 fidelity with which bob gets state @xmath5 .    until now",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is confined in some smaller region .",
    "since @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath6,n=0,1,2 ... $ ] , we can see that @xmath34 will become smaller as @xmath35 goes up and finally @xmath36 if all regions are combined ( note that @xmath37 ) @xmath38\\sqcup[\\frac{\\pi}{4}-a_1,\\frac{\\pi}{4}-a_2]\\nonumber\\\\ \\sqcup ... [\\frac{\\pi}{4}-a_n,\\frac{\\pi}{4}-a_{n+1}]\\sqcup ... =[0,\\frac{\\pi}{4}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the whole region of @xmath39 $ ] is covered .",
    "now , if we own sufficient non - maximally entangled states @xmath40 , the protocol for @xmath41 $ ] is completed .    on the other hand , we can deal with the region @xmath42 $ ] in a similar method .",
    "first , @xmath1 is divided into many small regions , i.e. , @xmath43,n=0,1,2 ... $ ] .",
    "then , on each small region , a non - maximally entangled state is provided in the following form @xmath44 subsequently , the procedure is entirely the same as that + of region @xmath45 $ ] , except that @xmath46 will be redefined as @xmath47 . again",
    "@xmath19 is some constant which keeps @xmath48 . after performing + all steps , we get @xmath49 according to @xmath50,n=0,1,2 .. $ ] , we also get @xmath51 $ ] , which induces @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath32 also denotes the minimum fidelity on each region . since this protocol can be carried out on any region @xmath52,n=0,1,2 ... $ ] , so we have completed the scheme for region @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "combined with the conclusion on region @xmath39 $ ] , the explicit protocol is feasible on the whole region @xmath54 $ ] .    in the above protocol , the total classical cost we need is 1 bit . a certain number of non - maximally entangled states is required for distinct regions of @xmath1 .",
    "the sufficient number is easily imaginable , e.g. , random astronomical number .",
    "however , it is unclear what the necessary number is .",
    "obviously , the smaller this number is , the better this protocol will become . from the above protocol",
    "we need two non - maximally entangled states @xmath55 for region @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 for region @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "a glancing observation will lead to the result that these two states are interconvertible by jointly local operation @xmath58 for any @xmath59 , which implies that the family of non - maximally entangled states for the region @xmath39 $ ] or the other family for the region @xmath53 $ ] will be enough for the whole region @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "this result immediately decreases the original number of entangled states to its half . from this brief process",
    "we infer that the necessary entanglement resource can be reduced .",
    "we analyze this parameter for the explicit protocol above in appendix a , where the main result is that we have to supply more and more shared entangled states with increasing fidelity @xmath32 and approximation accuracy around the central point @xmath61 .",
    "we will show that it is possible to carry out the above protocol with high fidelity , provided 1 cbit and some small number of entangled states are available . according to the above argument",
    ", it is necessary that @xmath62=0.\\ ] ] therefore @xmath35 must be very large as the minimum fidelity @xmath32 gradually tends to one , which says that @xmath32 has direct dependence to the number of shared entangled states .",
    "the proposition from appendix a indicates that , e.g. , at least 38 non - maximally entangled states are necessary to carry out the above protocol under the condition @xmath63 .",
    "while @xmath32 is required to be larger,@xmath64 will increase very fast .",
    "this conclusion also shows that we need much more entanglement resource when @xmath34 is smaller , so we try to improve the qualification of the above protocol by focusing on the small region near central point @xmath61 .      the technique in section ii supposes that alice and bob share the non - maximally entangled state @xmath65 when @xmath66\\sqcup[\\frac{\\pi}{4}+a_n,\\frac{\\pi}{4}+a_{n-1}],n=0,1,2 ... ,n$ ] , whose combination will be @xmath67\\sqcup[\\frac{\\pi}{4}+a_n,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ ] . here",
    "we deal with the small central region @xmath68 $ ] by using one maximally entangled state shared by alice and bob : @xmath69 first alice performs the following unitary operation on her particle @xmath70 then she measures this particle with basis @xmath12 and broadcast 1 bit to bob , who will do nothing if he gets 0 or @xmath13 if he gets 1 .",
    "thus bob will get the following states both in 50% @xmath71 so if bob receives 0 the protocol comes true , while he gets state @xmath72 , we observe that @xmath68 $ ] and if @xmath73 is very small , the two qubits @xmath74 and @xmath75 will be very close to each other .",
    "hence , the fidelity is @xmath76 so we obtain @xmath77 the connection between @xmath64 and @xmath32 is described in figure 1 and figure 2 , while several key points @xmath78 in the following table for there is one added maximally - entangled state . this protocol is a kind of @xmath79 substitution , which indeed requires that qubit @xmath80 replaces @xmath74 with a high fidelity .",
    "we also give another scheme based on the above discussion in appendix b , which is a kind of probabilistic exact protocol @xcite .",
    "combined with the technique in section ii on region @xmath81\\sqcup[\\frac{\\pi}{4}+a_n,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ ] , the whole protocol is now completed .",
