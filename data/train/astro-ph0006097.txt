    "observations of the cosmic microwave background provide fundamental information about the primordial inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "the temperature anisotropies on scales above a few degrees preserve information about primordial density fluctuations on scales larger than the acoustic horizon at the moment of recombination . since the first detection of the cmb anisotropy by the cobe satellite @xcite several groups have also reported observations on angular scales of about @xmath0 which roughly corresponds to the horizon size at recombination . obtaining",
    "the spectrum of the primordial anisotropies on smaller scales with high precision will allow us to verify several robust predictions of inflation and permit to determine the values of important cosmological parameters with high accuracy .",
    "future experiments @xcite will yield all  sky maps of the cmb with sufficiently high resolution and sensitivity .",
    "apart from estimates of the power spectrum with subsequent parameter determination , the cmb data also provides very important constraints on the nature of the perturbations that led to the formation of large  scale structure @xcite . to extract this information beyond the power spectrum we need to consider not only the amplitudes , but also the phases of the temperature field .",
    "one possible approach is under consideration in our paper .",
    "generally speaking , cosmological models based on the inflationary paradigm predict adiabatic gaussian fluctuations with a power spectrum slightly different from the scale invariant one ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the gaussianity of the density perturbations directly translates into gaussianity of the cmb temperature fluctuations on the sky .",
    "however , along with standard inflationary models , at present there still exist theories which are compatible with observations and predict non  gaussian primordial fluctuations . among them",
    "are , for instance , non ",
    "standard inflationary scenarios with two or more scalar fields , where one could expect significant deviations from gaussianity @xcite , namely , the perturbations there are quadratic in a gaussian field .",
    "another possibility to accumulate non  gaussianity in the cmb signals exists after recombination . even if the fluctuations were gaussian at the surface of the last scattering they may have acquired non ",
    "gaussian contributions due to subsequent weak gravitational lensing @xcite and due to various foregrounds like dust emission , synchrotron radiation , or unresolved point sources , to mention just a few @xcite .",
    "one should also take into account cosmic variance and additional non  gaussian instrumental noise in the observational data @xcite .",
    "therefore , establishing the gaussian nature of the signal or detecting some distinctive non  gaussianity is crucial .",
    "in fact , it would allow us to reveal the nature of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "for instance , a confirmation that the fluctuations of the cmb are gaussian would leave practically no alternative to standard inflation , since it would definitely rule out most of the models that predict non  gaussian fluctuations and are at present still compatible with observations .",
    "in addition , the investigation of non  gaussianity is also important for a practical reason .",
    "most of the current techniques for estimating the power spectrum from the observed signal with significant noise are optimised for the gaussian fields only @xcite .",
    "many authors have searched for non ",
    "gaussian signatures in cmb data and in the large  scale structure using such diverse tests as peak statistics @xcite , the genus curve @xcite , higher  order correlations @xcite , peak correlations @xcite , and global minkowski functionals @xcite .",
    "the first analysis of two  dimensional theoretical maps of the temperature fluctuations that used the total area , length of the boundary and genus for the excursion set was done by @xcite although without referring to minkowski functionals .",
    "@xcite discuss the application of the minkowski functionals to all  sky maps taking into account the curvature of the celestial sphere .",
    "they apply these statistics to the high  latitude portion of the four  year cobe dmr data and argued for its advantage as a test of gaussian signal .",
    "they conclude that the field is consistent with a gaussian random field .",
    "@xcite measure the genus of the temperature fluctuations in the cobe dmr 4-year sky maps and come to a similar conclusion .",
    "@xcite compute the bispectrum of the four  year cobe datasets and again fail to find evidence for non  gaussian behaviour .    however , @xcite study the distribution of an estimator for the normalised bispectrum and conclude that gaussianity is ruled out at the confidence level at least of 99% . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite suggest to use the partial minkowski functionals as quantitative descriptors of the geometrical properties of cmb maps .",
    "they apply their technique to the four  year dmr cobe data corrected for the galaxy contamination and also find significant deviations from gaussianity .",
    "it was later shown @xcite that the observed non  gaussianity can be explained by systematics .",
    "while these findings may appear confusing at first sight @xcite , they actually highlight the importance of studying non  gaussian fields in a quantitative way . after all , while the gaussian random field is a well  defined notion , non  gaussian fields are still have to be substantiated .",
    "for instance , @xcite introduce a non - gaussian model where perturbations in @xmath1space are drawn from independent @xmath2 distributions with @xmath3 degrees of freedom , while @xcite puts forward the use of @xmath2 distributions in real rather than in @xmath1space .    in our paper",
    ", we consider a cosmological model with non  gaussian initial conditions , with a statistics in real space following a @xmath4 distribution with one degree of freedom .",
    "this type of perturbations results in very special non  gaussianity of the cmb anisotropy .",
    "therefore , it is well suited for the study of statistical methods .",
    "we calculate the minkowski functionals and the distribution functions of extrema of the cmb field smoothed with cobe resolution in this model , and compare the outcome to the results for a gaussian field with the same spectrum .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we briefly review the definition of the minkowski functionals and the distribution of extrema in two dimensions , and compare their expectation values for a gaussian field and a @xmath4 field with the same smoothing scale and spectrum .",
    "as an aside , we investigate the behaviour of the one  point probability distribution under smoothing . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] we first outline an algorithm for doing fast fourier transforms on the sphere that was used for our cmb map simulations .",

    "is also called the excursion set of the field @xmath13 over the threshold @xmath3 .",
    "its properties can be characterised by a large variety of geometrical quantities , including the minkowski functionals @xcite .    from the mathematical point of view",
    ", minkowski functionals have several distinguishing properties .",
    "@xcite showed that all global morphological descriptors ( satisfying translational invariance and additivity ) for patterns in @xmath18-dimensional space are linear combinations of just @xmath19 minkowski functionals @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , in up to four dimensions all minkowski functionals have simple and intuitive geometrical meanings . in two dimensions",
    "these are :    * area : * : :    @xmath22 is the total area of all hot regions , that is    points where @xmath23 .",
    "* boundary length : * : :    @xmath24 is proportional to the total length of the    boundary between cold and hot regions .",
    "* euler characteristic : * : :    @xmath25 , being a purely topological quantity , counts    the number of isolated hot regions minus the number of isolated cold    regions .",
    "this is not exactly true on the sphere , where a generalised    gauss  bonnet theorem holds @xcite , but nevertheless we will use this    relation in the following calculations .",
    "since minkowski functionals are additive with respect to isolated parts of the sky , they can be used for patchy or incomplete coverage .",
    "their calculation requires only @xmath26 operations for calculating the minkowski functionals on a map of @xmath27 pixels , once the first and second derivatives of the field at the pixel locations are known @xcite .    both for a gaussian and a @xmath4 random field , the minkowski functionals in two dimensions are known analytically @xcite . since the field is normalised to unit variance ,",
    "the analytical values depend on a single parameter @xmath28 , given as the variance of any of the field s first derivatives .",

    ", we use these three distribution functions of all possible kinds of extrema  maxima , minima and saddle points  as another measure of non  gaussianity .",

    "the peak statistics for the gaussian random field have been thoroughly investigated @xcite , but unfortunately can not be written in a simple form .",
    "the same holds for the @xmath4 field , whose extrema distribution functions are in principle easily obtained from the gaussian case via equation  ( [ eq : square ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the shapes of the minkowski functional curves are universal , that is they do not depend on anything but the statistical nature ( gaussian or @xmath4 ) of the underlying random field , and the analytical expectation values only contain constants of proportionality , parametrised by the correlation radius @xmath42 .",
    "this is not the case for the distribution functions of extrema , where a second parameter @xmath43 also affects the shape of the curves .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure  [ fig : anal_extrema ] , by showing the expectation values for two different values of @xmath43 .    since the euler characteristic is proportional to the third minkowski functional @xmath44 , the distribution functions of extrema and the minkowski functionals are not independent . in the following section  [ sec : data ]",
    ", we will use the first two minkowski functionals @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the three distribution functions of extrema to test our models against the four  year cobe dmr data .",
    "however , let us first take a look at the effects of smoothing on non  gaussian fields .          as an aside , we note that cmb temperature maps usually suffer from considerable smearing through the finite instrument beam size and are usually smoothed in order to reduce the noise level .",
    "therefore , a non  gaussian cmb signal may appear in the map with a much distorted distribution . here , we attempt to quantify this effect .",
    "we focus on the one  point probability distribution ( pdf ) of the field , because it is easy to handle and also closely related to the zeroth minkowski functional , being nothing but its nagative first derivative .",
    "it is of course conceivable that a non  gaussian random field still has a gaussian pdf .",
    "other statistics can in principle be treated in a similar fashion .",
    "we start from the cosmological cmb signal and consider it as a random field @xmath47 on some @xmath18dimensional space , where in our case @xmath48 . introducing a smoothing filter @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the smoothing scale and @xmath51  since the unsmoothed field should be equal to the original field ",
    "we obtain the smoothed field @xmath52 by convolution : @xmath53 where the constant @xmath54 is chosen such that the smoothed field remains normalised to unit variance .",
    "we may think of @xmath52 as a field in @xmath19dimensional `` scale space '' @xcite .",
    "if the filter @xmath55 is gaussian , it obeys the diffusion equation @xmath56 where the laplacian @xmath57 is of course taken with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath58 only .    combining equations  ( [ eq : smooth ] ) and ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) ,",
    "we can write down an `` evolution equation '' for the field @xmath13 as the scale @xmath50 changes : @xmath59 the second expression @xmath60 in the operator enters through the scale  dependence of the normalisation factor @xmath54 .",
    "details of the calculation can be found in appendix  [ sec : equation - field ] .",
    "this equation enables us to study the one  point probability distribution @xmath61 of the smoothed field @xmath62 as the smoothing scale changes . writing this probability density as @xmath63 and applying the partial derivative with respect to @xmath50",
    ", we immediately obtain @xmath64 .",
    "\\label{eq : probability}\\ ] ] we refer the reader to appendix  [ sec : equation - probability ] for the technical details of this calculation .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 denotes the average of the laplacian of the field @xmath52 under the condition that its value @xmath13 is fixed .",
    "it is interesting to note that this equation is written in conservative form , that is its integral over @xmath66 vanishes .    for a variety of random fields ,",
    "the conditional average of the laplacian can be calculated analytically .",
    "most notably , for both the gaussian and the @xmath4 field @xmath67 . in these cases , the right  hand side of equation  ( [ eq : probability ] ) simply becomes equal to zero .",
    "as far as the gaussian random field is concerned , @xmath68 is a stationary solution of equation  ( [ eq : probability ] ) .",
    "this reflects the well  known fact that a gaussian random field stays gaussian under smoothing , and in fact under any linear filtering .    in the case of the @xmath4 field , however , the probability distribution is non  zero only for @xmath69 by equation  ( [ eq : square ] ) , and is not differentiable at the upper bound of the field .",
    "therefore , under smoothing the field evolves away from the @xmath4 distribution , and finally ends up with a distribution close to the stationary gaussian solution at large smoothing lengths .",
    "figure  [ fig : smoothing ] illustrates the effect using a @xmath4 random field with various degrees of smoothing .",
    "this shows that although our two models are fairly different at first glance , the noise , beam size and other effects of actual observations tend to make the fields appear more similar .",

    "although this method is supposed to remove most of the galactic contamination , we avoid the galactic plane completely by applying a cut to @xmath71 latitude .    for the statistical tests presented in the following , we use a large number of realizations of the gaussian and @xmath72 random fields .",
    "in both cases , we calculate the fields using a scale  free spectrum with a correlation radius of @xmath0 . to mimic the dmr beam ,",

    "here we use a fast fourier transform ( fft ) in flat space over spherical coordinates outlined by @xcite .",
    "this means that the fft is used in both the polar and the azimuthal direction , while other methods usually perform the fft over the polar angle alone .",

    "the resulting square map is illustrated by an example in figure  [ fig : squaremap ] .",
    "the extended field in real space , which now consists of two identical copies of the actual map , is periodic both in @xmath6 and in @xmath7 , and can therefore be expanded into a real  space fourier series : @xmath88    inverting equation  ( [ eq : fourierseries ] ) and inserting equation  ( [ eq : harmonicseries ] ) allows us to establish a relation between the fourier coefficients and the spherical harmonics coefficients @xmath76 : @xmath89 where the @xmath90 are the coefficients of the fourier series of the associated legendre functions : @xmath91    using the well  known @xcite recurrence relation for the associated legendre functions , it is easy to derive recurrence relations for numerical evaluation of the @xmath90 .",

    "this makes it unsuitable for applications that involve quadratures , where uniform pixelisations ( e.g.  @xcite ) are desirable .",
