    "unusual spin textures , identified as magnetic skyrmions of topological origin , were observed in helimagnetic crystals like mn si and fe@xmath0co@xmath1si , in a series of recent experiments qhexperim , nutronscattexp , lorentzexp .",
    "however , the possibility of such a phenomenon to occur on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane in ferromagnetic model was predicted by belavin and polyakov 40 years back , in a pioneering work , where they found exact skyrmions in a general framework with topological charge @xmath2 linked to any analytic functions @xcite .",
    "problem with this beautiful theoretical result was , that due to scale invariance of the solution it could give only metastable states , where for stabilizing the skyrmions one needs to bring in coupling parameters through additional interactions . in a helimagnetic model a dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) spin - orbital interaction term",
    "is added to the spin - spin ferromagnetic interaction , where the dm coupling breaks the unwanted scale invariance and stabilizes the solitons through competing forces between the ferromagnetic and the effective dm interactions .",
    "recent experimental observation of skyrmions in magnetic models is therefore a landmark confirmation of an old basic theoretical result proposed in bp .",
    "it is a bit surprising , that in the recent large collection of high - profile theoretical and experimental work dedicated to the magnetic skyrmions in helimagnets @xcite , rarely the work of bp @xcite is mentioned , which on the other hand is the theoretical basis for the topological skyrmion in magnetic model in 2d .",
    "it is also rather unexpected , that no other extension or generalization of the bp solutions was proposed in 2d , over these long years of development in the subject .",
    "our motivation here , is to bring in a novel contribution to the subject , by discovering a family of exact skyrmions for an anisotropic extension of the ferromagnetic model , through a physically motivated geometric ( in-)equality , which generalizes the bp result by going beyond the analytic functions and linking the skyrmions to the contemporary @xmath3 problem @xcite .",
    "such skyrmions exhibit more inherent asymmetry and anisotropy , properties akin also to the helimagnetic crystals with noninversion symmetry and anisotropy exhibited in 2d .",
    "therefore , a natural application of such asymmetric solitons to the helimagnetic model , through their stabilization under dm interaction might be a promising perspective to be verified in a precision experiment .",
    "as evident from the experimental images , the skyrmion magnetic pattern in helimagnets show extended structure for individual skyrmions in a 30 nm range , slowly varying over several lattice spacings @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can go for the continuum limit reducing the ferromagnetic hamiltonian @xmath4 from the heisenberg spin model on a 2d lattice with nearest neighbor interactions as h_hs=1 2 _ < * j * , * j * > * s_j**s_j *   h_f= 1 2d^2x ( ) ^2 ,   @xmath5 for constructing a helimagnetic model a crucial addition of a spin - orbital interaction is needed to the ferromagnetic hamiltonian ( [ hsc ] ) in the form of a dm term h_dm = d^2x(*m * ) , which was proposed phenomenologically way back in another landmark work @xcite .    note , that the dm hamiltonian ( [ dmc ] ) exhibits an explicitly broken space inversion symmetry as well as anisotropy , due to the appearance of only first order derivatives and interaction of the 2d coordinate space with the internal spin space , rewriting ( [ dmc ] ) as h_dm&= & d^2x ( m^1 _ y m^3 + m^2 _ x m^3 + m^3 ( _ x m^2- _ y m^1 ) ) therefore the basic helimagnetic model , for investigating the magnetic skyrmions of contemporary interest , may be given simply by the model hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spin exchange parameter , @xmath8 is the spin - orbital coupling and the ferromagnetic @xmath4 and the dm hamiltonian @xmath9 may be given by ( [ hsc ] ) and ( [ hdm2 ] ) , respectively .      here comes the most interesting topological concept , by noticing that the magnetic moment field @xmath10 defined in a 2d space ( @xmath11 being the polar coordinates ) takes values on a 2-_sphere _ @xmath12 . at the same time",
    ", for finite energy soliton solutions , @xmath13 must go to a fixed vector at space infinities @xmath14 this in turn compactifies the 2d space @xmath15 also to a 2-_sphere _ @xmath16 ( since space - infinities can be added as a fixed north pole to form a sphere ) , resulting to a @xmath17 mapping ( see fig .",

    "it is evident therefore , that topological charge is a geometrical property that can take only integer values @xmath22 and since it is conserved topologically , skyrmion with a fixed charge can not decay into a configuration with a different charge and hence acquires a topological stability .",
    "the original idea of a topological skyrmion to appear in pure ferromagnetic model ( [ hsc ] ) was put forward in @xcite . however",
    "due to scale invariance of such skyrmions the states remain metastable and difficult to observe in experiments .",
    "therefore for stabilizing the solitons some scale must be introduced , as done by additional @xmath23 coupling in a helimagnetic model .    for understanding",
    "therefore the original idea of @xcite for constructing the skyrmions , let us concentrate on ferromagnetic hamiltonian @xmath24 ( [ hsc ] ) alone and note that , since charge @xmath18 for a skyrmion is conserved , if we ensure a lower bound for the hamiltonian like @xmath25 , the _ energy _ can not decay into the vacuum , making the state stable and at the same time the configuration reaching the lowest bound ( i.e. when _ equality _ is achieved ) should minimize the energy , producing thus the needed soliton solution . to elaborate the picture let us express magnetic moment @xmath26 through two spherical angles @xmath27 on @xmath20 : @xmath28,\\gamma        ( \\rho , \\alpha ) \\in [ 0,2\\pi]\\ ] ] as m^ = m^1im^2= e^ i ,   m^3= and rewrite for convenience ferromagnetic hamiltonian ( [ hsc ] ) as h_f= d^2x h_f ( , ) ,  h_f ( , ) = 1 2 ( ( ) ^2+^2 ( ) ^2 ) and the topological charge as q= 1 4 d^2x q ( , ) ,   q ( , ) = for further insight we introduce two field vectors = ,  * y*= to rewrite & & h_f ( , ) = 1 2 ( * x*^2 + * y*^2 ) ,   q(,)=[*x * ] which by using an obvious inequality 1 2 ( ( x_1- y_2)^2+(x_2+y_1)^2 ) 0 and regrouping the terms as @xmath29 leads clearly to @xmath30 , which by integrating both sides gives the required inequality @xmath31 . for answering the next question , that is , when we can get the equality @xmath32 , we focus again on ( [ crin ] ) and see clearly that equality is achieved at the relations x_1= y_2 ,  x_2=-y_1 , which are simple first order equations , allowing exact skyrmion solutions . interestingly , mapping @xmath26 to a complex field ( stereographic projection ) : @xmath33 one can map the minimizing condition ( [ x1y2 ] ) to a similar relations @xmath34 which is known to us very well as the cauchy - riemann ( cr ) condition for analyticity @xmath35 of a complex function @xmath36 therefore the bp result concludes , that any analytic function f(z)= , n=_i n_i-_jn_j , with @xmath37 any arbitrary constant complex numbers , would be an exact skyrmion solution of the ferromagnetic model with topological charge @xmath38 , where we have explicit scale invariance @xmath39 of the solution .     the simplest exact solution obtained from the above general result as @xmath40 leading to the skyrmion solution for the magnetic moment in the ferromagnetic model ( [ hf ] ) as m^3== ,  m^3 ( = 0)=-1 ,  m^3 ( = ) = + 1",

    "it is rather surprising , that even for the helimagnetic model exhibiting high level of asymmetry and anisotropy , the contemporary theoretical models look for only skyrmions with circular symmetry .",
    "our findings , as we show below , will be tuned towards asymmetric skyrmion solutions .",
    "our motivation is to look for more general solutions beyond symmetric skyrmions , which might be detected in future precision experiments .",
    "we intend to find some way to extend the bp solutions .",
    "however since the bp procedure seems to be built on a specific construction using a particular inequality ( [ crin ] ) , it is difficult to get any clue for its generalization .",
    "therefore , we turn for new ideas to some physically motivated inequalities of geometric nature with an universal appeal , called isoperimetric inequalities .      it is a common experience , that the soap bubbles , deformed at its starting always try to take the spherical shape in time .",
    "this is because the bubble surface @xmath41 is lower bounded by its volume @xmath42 and tends to reach the equilibrium point by minimizing its surface area , which is achieved for a sphere , at reaching the equality .",
    "interestingly , this universal concept remains valid also in 2d , where for any closed curve its perimeter @xmath43 is bounded from below by the area enclosed : @xmath44 , through the relation @xmath45 .",
    "it is not difficult to check , that the equality is reached at the maximum symmetry , i.e. when the the curve turns into a circle .",
    "this picture becomes even more interesting at discrete symmetries , where for a polygon of @xmath46-sides the perimeter @xmath47 and the enclosed area @xmath48 are related through an inequality @xmath49 the equality is achieved , as expected , at the symmetric situation , when the polygon becomes a regular one with equal sides and equal angles ( which is a nice check using simple geometric relations ) .",
    "particular cases of this ( in-)equality with @xmath50 will proved to be important for us .",
    "first let us consider a parallelogram generated by two vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 which should satisfy the inequality for n - polygon with @xmath53 : @xmath54 , since @xmath55 .",
    "the inequality expressed through these vectors therefore takes the form ( see fig .",

    "thus we could derive the same lower bound of the ferromagnetic hamiltonian @xmath24 through topological charge @xmath18 , as obtained by bp @xcite using a restricted inequality ( ) , from a general framework of universal inequalities for polygons through a geometric construction .",
    "now , let us see how further we can go in retrieving the bp construction from the present geometric approach .",
    "as we should have guessed , the equality in ( [ paralel ] ) for the parallelogram would be achieved for its maximum symmetry , i.e. when it reduces to a square having ( see fig .",
    "2a ) |*x * | = | * y*| ,    ( * x * ) = 0 ,   ( * x * , * y * ) _ 0=90^o .",
    "it is easy to check this intriguing fact , that a geometric equality , obtained for a square ( [ square ] ) from an overall symmetry is exactly compatible with the self - duality condition ( ) linked to the cr condition @xmath62 for an analytic function giving exact skyrmion solutions in the ferromagnetic model @xcite .",
    "the relation like ( [ square ] ) found here linked to the cr condition can give also an uncommon realization for the analyticity condition of a complex field @xmath63 in the form |u",
    "| = |v | ,   ( u u)=|u |^2  90^o= 0 ,   ( u , v ) = 90^o",
    "inspired by the above success in rederiving the exact bp skyrmions for the ferromagnetic model , following a different geometric route of universal nature related to a parallelogram , we intend to focus now on a triangular inequality , in the hope for generalizing the bp result .",
    "therefore , we focus on the above polygon relation and specialize for a new case : @xmath64 leading to the inequality @xmath65 .",
    "the triangle generated by the above two vectors clearly defines the perimeter of the triangle as @xmath66 while the area of the triangle may be given through @xmath67| $ ] expressing the triangular inequality explicitly as ( see fig .",

    ".7 cm    further working on the lhs and using repeatedly the schwartz inequality one derives from ( [ triang1 ] ) a new relation 1 2 ( * x*^2 + * y*^2-(*x * ) ) 2    ferromagnetic model . to see this we represent the vectors as ( [ xy ] ) and comparing with the expression ( [ hf ] used for the ferromagnetic model in the bp case ,",

    "interestingly , the lower bound for this new anisotropic ferromagnetic hamiltonian @xmath72 through topological charge @xmath18 follows from the relation ( [ triang2 ] ) as _ f 2 q , where @xmath72 is given by ( [ hfanis ] ) with the standard ferromagnetic hamiltonian as in ( [ hsc ] ) and the topological charge @xmath18 as in ( [ q ] ) .",

    "the next important question is , can one find exact skyrmion solutions minimizing the hamiltonian of the new model ( [ hfanis ] ) .",
    "since such a configuration should saturate the lower bound in ( [ afq ] ) as @xmath74 , we seek for the equality in the triangular relations ( [ triang1 ] ) or ( [ triang2 ] ) which , as per the general philosophy we have witnessed above , should be achieved at a maximal symmetry , i.e. for an equilateral triangle giving the condition ( see fig .",

    "the relation ( [ xyanis ] ) or equivalently the equilateral condition ( [ 60 ] ) minimizes the model hamiltonian @xmath72 and therefore take us beyond the bp skyrmion . at the same time , the minimization condition ( [ xyanis ] ) maps under the stereographic projection to a complex function generalizing an analytic function and hence satisfying an intriguing extension of the cr - condition : & & f(z , |z)=u+i v ,   _",

    "this is like a nontrivial rotation in the 2d gradient space @xmath76 where rotational angle @xmath77 recovers the standard cr relations , while @xmath78 corresponds to our case , giving new exact skyrmion solutions through a class of complex functions beyond usual analyticity .    in general for finding the topological solitons in such magnetic models for the magnetic moments @xmath79 one has to solve the governing euler - equations for the angles @xmath80 by minimizing the model hamiltonian .",

    "therefore for physically observed configurations such skyrmions need to be stabilized by coupling to other interactions , which can break the explicit scale invariance of the system .",
    "this was realized in the known helimagnetic model @xcite , where a dm interaction ( [ hdm2 ] ) was considered in addition to the ferromagnetic hamiltonian ( [ hf ] ) .",
    "we shall adopt a similar strategy in stabilizing the asymmetric skyrmion solutions of our anisotropic ferromagnetic model ( [ hfanis ] ) by adding the same dm interaction ( [ hdm2 ] ) to it .",

    "it is crucial to observe , that under a scale transformation : @xmath110 the exchange terms and the dm terms behave differently , since all exchange terms contain gradients in second order , while the terms in the dm interaction have them only in the first order . as a result under the above scale transformation only the dm terms ( [ eqdmbeta ] , [ eqdmgamma ] ) acquire a multiplicative factor @xmath111 while the exchange terms remain scale invariant .",
    "therefore , in the absence of dm interaction the scaling factor @xmath111 remains arbitrary including a vanishing value , making the ferromagnetic skyrmion to be metastable .",
    "however , with the additional dm terms as in our case , , with the factor @xmath111 explicitly appearing in the euler equations , it gets fixed through the coupling parameters @xmath112 of the model acquiring a nonvanishing value .",

    "the derivation and construction of the skyrme crystal and skyrme lattice solutions for the helimagnetic model outlined above , will not be presented here in detail , since our basic aim is to put forward our novel idea and to show how it works .",
    "the recent experimental observation of skyrmions in helimagnetic materials on a 2d plane , is a triumph of the theoretical prediction of such exact topological solitons in a ferromagnetic model proposed 40 years ago by belavin and polyakov ( bp ) bp , though due to the metastable states they could not be detected in the original model . on the other hand ,",
    "during all these years , there was hardly any proposal which could generalize the idea of bp for constructing novel exact solitons of topological origin in other 2d models , which consequently , could be tested experimentally .",
    "we have presented here such a new idea based on some geometric inequalities of universal nature and found new exact topological solitons with intrinsic asymmetry in an anisotropic ferromagnetic model .",
    "this result generalizes the well known cauchy - riemann condition as a new minimization condition for the model hamiltonian and extends the bp skyrmions to a novel class of exact asymmetric skyrmions .",
    "such skyrmion solutions are linked to a new class of _ generalized _ functions related to the @xmath3 problem and might have far reaching consequences in terms of generalized symmetries in conformal field theory and related algebraic structures @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our result could be applied to the helimagnetic models of contemporary interest , for finding individual skyrmions as well as skyrmion crystals and lattice exhibiting asymmetry and anisotropy , as a natural solutions of the governing equations , which hopefully could be verified in precision experiments .",
    "therefore the expected impact of the present proposal is twofold . as a theoretical result",
    ", it goes beyond the original idea of bp and constructs exact skyrmions with intrinsic asymmetry , giving an intriguing generalization of the class of analytic functions . as an application ,",
    "our approach constructs solutions for skyrmions , skyrmion crystals and skyrmion lattice with asymmetry , bearing experimental interests in helimagnets .",
