    "the knowledge of the weak transition form factors of heavy mesons is crucial for a proper extraction of the quark mixing parameters , for the analysis of non - leptonic decays and cp violating effects and , related to it , for a search of new physics .",
    "theoretical approaches for calculating these form factors are quark models @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , and lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "although in recent years considerable progress has been made , the theoretical uncertainties are still uncomfortably large .",
    "an accuracy better than 15% has not been attained .",
    "moreover each of the above methods has only a limited range of applicability , namely :    qcd sum rules are suitable for describing the low @xmath2 region of the form factors .",
    "the higher @xmath2 region is hard to get and higher order calculations are not likely to give real progress because of the appearance of many new parameters .",
    "the accuracy of the method can not be arbitrarily improved because of the necessity to isolate the contribution of the states of interest from others .",
    "lattice qcd gives good results for the high @xmath2 region .",
    "but because of the many numerical extrapolations involved this method does not provide for a full picture of the form factors and for the relations between the various decay channels .",
    "quark models do provide such relations and give the form factors in the full @xmath2 range .",
    "however , quark models are not closely related to the qcd lagrangian ( or at least this relationship is not well understood yet ) and therefore have input parameters which are not directly measurable and may not be of fundamental significance .",
    "in this situation it becomes evident that a combination of various methods will be fruitful .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to obtain this way reliable predictions for many decay form factors in their full @xmath2 ranges .    to achieve this goal",
    ", one needs a general frame for the description of the large variety of processes",
    ". this can be only a suitable quark model , because only a quark model can connect different processes through the soft wave functions of the mesons and describes the full @xmath2 range of the form factors .",
    "has been done in @xcite where a simple lattice - constrained parametrization based on the constituent quark picture of ref .",
    "@xcite and pole dominance has been proposed . ]",
    "the predictions of this model will be much improved by incorporating the results from the more fundamental qcd based methods .",
    "historically , constituent quark models have been first to analyse the meson transition form factors .",
    "although a rigorous derivation of this approach as an effective theory of qcd in the nonperturbative regime has not been obtained , relativistic quark models work surprisingly well for the description of the meson spectra and form factors .",
    "moreover , constituent quark models provide so far the only operative method for dealing with excited states .",
    "constituent quark models are based on the following phenomena expected from qcd :    \\i ) chiral symmetry breaking in the low - energy region provides for the masses of the constituent quarks ;    \\ii ) the strong peaking of the soft ( nonperturbative ) hadronic wave functions in terms of the quark momenta with a width of the order of the confinement scale ; and    \\iii ) the dominance of fock states with the minimal number of constituents , i.e. a @xmath5 composition of mesons .",
    "an important shortcoming of previous quark model predictions was a strong dependence of the results on the special form of the quark model and on the parameter values .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that once ( a ) a proper relativistic formalism is used for the description of the transition form factors and ( b ) the numerical parameters of the model are chosen properly ( we discuss criteria for such a proper choice below ) , the quark model yields results in full agreement with existing experimental data and in accord with the predictions of more fundamental theoretical approaches . in addition , our quark model allows to predict many other form factors which have not yet been measured .",
    "for the description of the transition form factors in their full @xmath2 range and for various initial and final mesons , a fully relativistic treatment is necessary .",
    "we therefore choose a formulation of the quark model which is based on the relativistic dispersion approach @xcite and thus guarantees the correct spectral and analytic properties .    within this model ,",
    "the transition form factors are given by relativistic double spectral representations through the wave functions of the initial and final mesons both in the scattering and the decay regions .",
    "these spectral representations obey rigorous constraints from qcd on the structure of the long - distance corrections in the heavy quark limit .",
    "namely , the form factors of the dispersion quark model have the correct heavy - quark expansion at leading and next - to - leading @xmath6 orders in accordance with qcd for transitions between heavy quarks @xcite . for the heavy - to - light transition",
    "the dispersion quark model satisfies the relations between the form factors of vector , axial - vector , and tensor currents valid at small recoil @xcite . in the limit of the heavy - to - light transitions at small @xmath2",
    "the form factors obey the lowest order @xmath6 and @xmath7 relations of the large energy effective theory @xcite and provide the pattern of higher - order symmetry - violating effects .    another important advantage of the dispersion formulation of the quark model is the fact that one directly obtains the form factors in the physical decay region @xmath8 .",
    "no numerical extrapolation from space - like values is required .      in previous applications of quark models",
    "the transition form factors turned out to be sensitive to the numerical parameters , such as the quark masses and the slopes of the meson wave functions .",
    "as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the way to control these parameters is to use the results of lattice calculations at large @xmath2 as experimental inputs . in",
    "@xcite the @xmath9 and @xmath10 constituent quark masses and slope parameters of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 wave functions have been obtained through this procedure .",
    "we now consider in addition the charm and strange mesons . to determine the slope parameters for the charm and strange meson wave functions and the effective mass values @xmath14 and @xmath15 we use here as input the measured total rates for the decays @xmath16 .",
    "by fixing the parameters in this way we overcome important uncertainties inherent in quark model calculations .",
    "indeed , with these few inputs we can give numerous predictions for the form factors for the transitions of the heavy and strange heavy mesons @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath11 , and @xmath19 into light mesons which nicely agree at places where data are available .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly presents the main features of the double spectral representations of the form factors . in section iii",
    "we determine the numerical parameters of the model and give the predictions of the form factors .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the long - distance contribution to meson decays is contained in the relativistic invariant transition form factors of the vector , axial - vector and tensor currents .",
    "the amplitudes of the @xmath20 transition induced by the weak @xmath21 quark transition through the vector @xmath22 , axial - vector @xmath23 , tensor @xmath24 , and pseudotensor @xmath25 currents , have the following covariant structure @xcite @xmath26 ,    \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the form factors corresponding to the decay region @xmath8 are then derived by performing the analytical continuation .",
    "the transition of the initial meson @xmath35 with the mass @xmath36 to the final meson @xmath37 with the mass @xmath38 induced by the quark transition @xmath39 through the current @xmath40 is described by the diagram of fig.[fig : trianglegraph ] . for constructing the double spectral representation we must consider a double  cut graph where all intermediate particles go on mass shell but the initial and final mesons have the off ",
    "shell momenta @xmath41 and and @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 kept fixed .",
    "the quark structure of the initial and final mesons is given in terms of the vertices @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the initial pseudoscalar meson vertex has the spinorial structure @xmath48 ; the final meson vertex has the structure @xmath49 for a pseudoscalar state and the structure @xmath50\\,g_2/\\sqrt{n_c}$ ] , @xmath51 , @xmath52 for an @xmath53wave vector meson .",
    "the double spectral densities @xmath54 of the form factors are obtained by calculating the relevant traces and isolating the lorentz structures depending on @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these invariant factors @xmath54 account for the two  particle singularities in the feynman graph .",
    "for @xmath34 the spectral representations of the form factors have the form @xcite @xmath55 where the wave function @xmath56 and @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the triangle function .",
    "include proper subtraction terms .",
    "these subtraction terms have been determined in @xcite by matching the structure of the heavy quark expansion in the quark model to the structure of the heavy - quark expansion in qcd ] the analytical continuation of the expression ( [ dr ] ) to the region @xmath8 gives the form factor at @xmath59 .",

    "( [ dr ] ) should be multiplied by the constituent quark form factor @xmath60 which contributes to the resonance structure in the @xmath2 channel . however , in the region of calculation @xmath61 , the wave functions provide already for a rise of the form factors with @xmath2 , which is well compatible with a properly located meson pole .",
    "thus , an additional quark form factor is not needed there , but we will use a proper extrapolation formula when considering the vicinity of the poles ( see eq ( [ fit1 ] ) below ) . ]    the soft wave function of a meson @xmath62 $ ] can be written as follows @xmath63 with @xmath64 . here",
    "the ground - state radial @xmath53-wave function @xmath65 is normalized as @xmath66 .",

    "we assume a simple gaussian parametrization of the radial wave function @xmath68 which satisfies the localization requirement for @xmath69 .",
    "the leptonic decay constant of the pseudoscalar meson @xmath70 is given in terms of its wave function by the spectral representation @xcite @xmath71",
    "we consider the slope parameter @xmath72 of the meson wave function ( [ gauss ] ) and the constituent quark masses as fit parameters . the relevant values for the @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath12 mesons have already been determined in @xcite from a fit to the lattice results on the form factors @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "( [ wsbff ] ) below ) at @xmath75 and @xmath76gev@xmath77 @xcite .",
    "thereby , use has been made of the spectral representation of the leptonic decay constant ( [ fp ] ) , and the double spectral representations ( [ dr ] ) of the form factors . the values obtained for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 are displayed in table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "a few comments on these numbers are in order :    * the quark model double spectral representations take into account long - range qcd effects but not the short - range perturbative corrections .",
    "however , by fitting the wave functions and masses to reproduce the lattice points , these corrections are effectively taken care of : corrections to the quark propagators correspond to the appearance of the effective quark masses .",
    "corrections to the vertices at the relevant values of the recoil variable @xmath83 should be small as found in form factors of other meson transitions @xcite .",
    "* the value obtained for the @xmath9-quark mass @xmath84 is close to the one - loop pole mass which in fact is the relevant mass for quark model calculations .",
    "we now need to fix the parameters describing the strange and charmed mesons .",
    "the charm quark mass can be determined from the well - known @xmath6 expansion of the heavy meson mass in terms of the heavy quark mass and the hadronic parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "using the recent estimates of these parameters @xcite one finds @xmath88 this provides @xmath89 . for @xmath15",
    "one expects @xmath90 taking into account that @xmath91 .    a stringent way to constrain the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94",
    "is provided by the measured integrated rates of the semileptonic decays @xmath4 .",
    "in addition we apply the relation ( [ fp ] ) which connects @xmath92 with @xmath15 by using the known value of the @xmath95-meson leptonic decay constant @xmath96 .",
    "the parameter values found this way are displayed in table [ table : parameters ] and @xmath17 decays .",
    "however , the corresponding form factors have a rather flat @xmath2-dependence and do not match the lattice results at large @xmath2 . ] . the corresponding form factors and decay rates are given in tables [ table : fitsd2k ] and [ table : ratesd2k ] .",
    "the polarization of the @xmath97 in the @xmath98 decays turns out to be in good agreement with the experimental result ( table [ table : ratesd2k ] ) , and the calculated @xmath17 meson decay constant @xmath99 corresponds to the expectation for the magnitude of this quantity",
    ".    the parameter @xmath100 can not be found this way , but it should be close to @xmath94 because of the heavy quark symmetry requirements .",
    "we therefore set @xmath101 .",
    "also listed in table [ table : parameters ] are the parameters which describe strange heavy mesons .",
    "they are discussed in subsection d.    .[table : parameters ] constituent quark masses and slope parameters of the exponential wave function ( in @xmath102 ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the coupling constants we obtain @xmath103",
    "we have calculated numerous form factors of heavy meson transitions to light mesons which are relevant for the semileptonic ( charged current ) and penguin ( flavor - changing neutral current ) decay processes .",
    "our approach is based on evaluating the triangular decay graph within a relativistic quark model which has the correct analytical properties and satisfies all known general requirements of qcd .",
    "the model connects different decay channels in a unique way and gives the form factors for all relevant @xmath2 values .",
    "the disadvantage of the constituent quark model connected with its dependence on ill - defined parameters such as the effective constituent quark masses , have been reduced by using several constraints : the quark masses and the slope parameters of the wave functions are chosen such that the calculated form factors reproduce the lattice results for the @xmath3 form factors at large @xmath2 and the observed integrated rates of the semileptonic @xmath104 decays .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * in spite of the rather different masses and properties of mesons involved in weak transitions , all existing data on the form factors , both from theory and experiment , can be understood in our quark picture .",
    "namely , all the form factors are essentially described by the few degrees of freedom of constituent quarks , i.e. their wave functions and their effective masses .",
    "details of the soft wave functions are not crucial ; only the spatial extention of these wave functions of order of the confinement scale is important . in other words ,",
    "only the meson radii are essential . *",
    "the calculated transition form factors are in all cases in good agreement with the results available from lattice qcd and from sum rules in their specific regions of validity .",
    "the only exception is a disagreement with the lcsr results for the @xmath105 transition where we predict larger form factors .",
    "this disagreement is caused by a different way of taking into account the su(3 ) violating effects when going from @xmath106 to @xmath105 and is not related to specific details of the dynamics of the decay process .",
    "we suspect that the lcsr method overestimates the su(3 ) breaking in the long - distance region but this problem deserves further clarification .",
    "* we have estimated the products of the meson weak and strong coupling constants by using the fit formulas for the form factors for the extrapolation to the meson pole .",
    "the error of such estimates connected with the errors in the extrapolation procedure is found to be around 5 - 10% .",
    "we can not provide for definite error estimates of our predictions for the form factors because of the approximate character of the constituent quark model .",
    "however from the fine agreement obtained in cases where checks are possible , we believe that the actual accuracy of our predictions for the form factors is around 10% . since some parameters have been fixed by using lattice results and have also been tested using the sum rule predictions , further improvements of the accuracy of our predictions will follow if these approaches attain smaller errors .",
    "of course , each precisely measured decay will also allow a more accurate determination of the parameters of the model and thus can be used to diminish the errors at least for closely related decays .",

    "we provide here definitions of the coupling constants which determine the behavior of the form factors at @xmath2 near the resonance poles ( beyond the decay region ) .",
    "we consider as an example the case of the @xmath107 transition .",
    "the form factors @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 contain pole at @xmath121 due to the contribution of the intermediate @xmath110 ( @xmath122 state ) in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "the residue of this pole is given in terms of the product of the weak and strong coupling constants such that in the region @xmath123 the form factors read @xmath124 here @xmath125 stand for the terms non - singular at @xmath126 .",
    "similarly , @xmath127 contains the contribution of the @xmath11 ( @xmath128 state ) . in the region of @xmath129",
    "it can be represented as follows @xmath130 first let us notice that the residues of the form factors are not all independent and are connected with each other as follows : @xmath131 this relation can be used as a cross - check of the consistency of the extrapolation for the form factors .",
