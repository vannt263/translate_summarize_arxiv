    "spintronics is a rich research field , not only for the wide applications of low energy consumption and energy transformation devices , but also for the new physics with the interplays among charge , spin , orbital , heat and so on @xcite .",
    "the spin hall effect ( she ) , which converts the injected longitudinal charge current into the transverse spin current via the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , is crucial for the development of spintronic devices .",
    "the she is characterized by the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities ( or conductivities ) , called spin hall angle ( sha ) .",
    "the magnitude of sha describes conversion efficiency between the charge current and the spin current , while the sign distinguishes the scattering direction of electrons , i.e. , clockwise or anticlockwise into the transverse direction .",
    "it is well known that to raise the magnitude of sha is the key to enhance the whole efficiency of the devices based on the she @xcite .",
    "however , the sign of sha is not yet utilized as a degree of freedom in spintronic devices .    in the experiment of the dilute cuir alloys ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the she was verified to be an extrinsic skew scattering mechanism , and the sha was measured to be positive 2.1% @xcite .",
    "we have found out in theory that including the local correlation effects of the @xmath0 orbitals of ir is decisive to obtain a positive sign of sha consistent with experiment , and a small change of the @xmath0 electron number of ir with the local correlations may change the sign @xcite .    on the other hand , among the previous theoretical works about the she of the cu alloys doped with @xmath0 elements , fert and levy estimated the sha by the atomic electron numbers of @xmath0 orbitals with soi , obtaining a sign change of sha in the middle of the series of @xmath0 impurities @xcite . in contrary , based on the @xmath2 @xmath3 calculations , including the soi in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , fedorov et al . obtained an uniform sign of sha contributed by the skew scattering among the series of @xmath0 impurities from lu to pt @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the she among the dilute cu alloys with a series of @xmath0 elements as impurities , and find the key factors which are decisive on the sign of sha .",
    "furthermore , we screen out the alloys whose signs of sha are sensitive to perturbation of the local correlations as cuir , which will be favorable for the sign control of she .",
    "the extrinsic she is caused by the spin - orbit interactions ( soi ) in the orbitals of the impurities .",
    "as one of the mechanisms of extrinsic she , the skew scattering generates the spin hall resistivity linear with the impurity concentration in the dilute alloys . based on the anderson model @xcite , the contribution of skew scattering on the extrinsic she in the nonmagnetic cu alloys with dilute @xmath0 impurities can be described by a single - impurity multi - orbital model , including the soi in both the @xmath1 orbitals @xmath4 and the @xmath0 orbitals @xmath5 of the impurity with the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , together with the local correlations of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) within ( between ) the @xmath0 orbitals , and the hund coupling @xmath10 between the @xmath0 orbitals of the impurity @xcite : @xmath11 @xmath12 in eq.([andersonmodel0 ] ) , @xmath13 is the energy band @xmath14 of the cu host , @xmath15 is the energy level of the orbital @xmath16 of the @xmath0 impurity , and @xmath17 is the hybridization between the orbital @xmath16 of the impurity and the band @xmath14 of the host . in eq.([andersonmodel ] ) , the local correlations are included only within the localized @xmath0 orbitals @xmath5 of the impurity , employing the relations of @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 .    in the orbital with the orbital angular momentum @xmath20 , the soi split the states of the orbital into",
    "two groups of degenerated states with the total angular momentum @xmath21 and the degeneracy @xmath22 . in the cu alloys with the @xmath0 impurities including soi , according to the the friedel sum rule @xcite",
    ", the phase shifts @xmath23 can be calculated from the occupation numbers @xmath24 of the spin - orbit split states of the impurity and the cu host , @xmath25 where @xmath20=1 corresponds to the @xmath1 states of the impurity and the @xmath26 states of cu , @xmath20=2 corresponds to @xmath0 states of the impurity and the @xmath27 states of cu , respectively .",
    "the total occupation number of the @xmath0 states of the impurity @xmath28 can be obtained by @xmath29 the occupation number of each of the degenerate @xmath0 states of the impurity @xmath30 can be obtained by @xmath31 where @xmath30 will be between 0 and 1 .",
    "the occupation numbers of the impurities are defined via projections of the occupied states onto the wannier states centered at the impurities as point defects and extended in the whole supercell . in the dilute alloys ,",
    "a point defect can not be charged in metal .",
    "thus the total occupation numbers of the @xmath32 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 states of the impurities are conserved to the atomic valence electron numbers @xcite , @xmath33 where the constant @xmath34=4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 , for the impurities of hf , ta , w , re , os , ir , pt , au and hg , respectively .",
    "based on the model in eq.([andersonmodel0 ] ) , by the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , the @xmath0 states of the impurities can be considered as virtual bound states with a width parameter @xmath35 , and the @xmath36 states correspond to the energy levels of @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "it has the relations of @xcite @xmath38 where the @xmath39 is the fermi level and @xmath40 are the energy levels of the @xmath36 states relative to the fermi level . while the local correlations are included in the @xmath0 states of the impurity as in eq.([andersonmodel ] ) , it has the self - consistent relations of @xcite @xmath41 which will raise the @xmath0 energy level and lower the @xmath0 occupation numbers of the impurity @xcite .",
    "the decrease of @xmath28 will induce the increase of @xmath42 according to eq.([charge ] ) , which can be approximately estimated by fixing the ratios of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding phase shifts can be obtained by eq.([phaseshifts ] ) .    for the she contributed by the skew scattering in cu alloys with @xmath0 impurities",
    ", the sha defined in terms of resistivity @xmath45 @xcite can be calculated from the phase shifts @xmath46 of the @xmath47 channels and @xmath48 of the @xmath49 channels .",

    "based on the model in eq.([andersonmodel ] ) and the formula in eq.([sha0 ] ) , to calculate the sha for the cu alloys with a series of @xmath0 impurities , we employ the combined method of the density functional theory ( dft ) and hf approximation , as we have done before for the cuir alloys @xcite .",
    "for the dilute alloys of cu with a series of @xmath0 impurities , including the soi in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , the @xmath0 occupation numbers @xmath58 and the sha are calculated by the dft+hf method following eqs.([sc2 ] ) and ( [ sha0 ] ) , without the local correlations ( @xmath8=0 ) or with the local correlations of @xmath8=0.5 ev in the @xmath0 orbitals of the impurities , respectively , as shown in fig.[hf1 ] .",
    "estimates from experiments give the parameter of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath8 of @xmath0 orbitals in the range of 0 - 1.0 ev for pure metals @xcite , 0 - 1.5 ev for insulating compounds @xcite , less than 0.4 ev for the ferromagnetic metal of osmates @xcite , about 0.5 ev for iridates @xcite , and 0.5 - 0.6 ev for pt alloys @xcite .",
    "below we take @xmath8=0.5 ev to compare the whole series of @xmath0 impurities in cu alloys .    as @xmath8 switches from 0 to 0.5 ev ,",
    "according to eq.([andersonmodel ] ) based on the anderson model @xcite , the @xmath0 state will be shifted up , accompanied by a decrease of @xmath58 .",
    "the amount of the shift varies among the @xmath0 impurities , as intuitively shown in fig.[anderson5d ] .",
    "the @xmath58 lowered by @xmath8 for each of the @xmath0 impurities are marked in fig.[hf1](a ) . in the middle of the series with @xmath58 around the half - filling value of 5 , the @xmath58 is obviously affected by @xmath8 , corresponding to the schematic picture in fig.[anderson5d ] that the peaks of the @xmath0 band from hf to pt are relatively close to the fermi level .",
    "previous theories leave the following discrepancy regarding the sign of the sha in the cu alloys with @xmath0 impurities contributed by the skew scattering .",
    "fert and levy gave a sign change of sha in the middle of the @xmath0 series , including the soi only in the @xmath0 orbitals without local correlations , and taking the phase shift of @xmath50 channel as a parameter @xcite .",
    "fedorov et al .",
    "obtained that the signs of sha among a series of @xmath0 impurities from hf to pt do not change , including the soi in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals but without local correlations .",
    "their result for cuir is opposite in sign to the experiment under the consistent definition of sha via resistivity @xcite .    in comparison , in fig.[hf1](b ) , the series of sha under @xmath8=0 is very close to the @xmath2 @xmath3 results of the cu alloys with the impurities from ta to pt in ref.@xcite ( with the sha consistently defined via resistivity ) , as expected .",
    "however , the series of sha deviate obviously between @xmath8=0 and @xmath8=0.5 ev , except for the cuhg case with the @xmath0 states nearly fully occupied .",
    "it is remarkable that for the cases of cuir and cupt , the sha changes sign between @xmath8=0 and @xmath8=0.5 ev .",
    "moreover , with @xmath8=0.5 ev , cuir gives a sha of + 1.6% , consistent to experimental value of + 2.1% @xcite , as marked in fig.[hf1](b ) .",
    "these facts demonstrate that the soi in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , together with the local correlations in the @xmath0 orbitals of the impurities , are decisive on the sign of sha of the cu alloys .",
    "all of these three factors are necessary to be included properly to estimate the sha contributed by the skew scattering .",
    "fig.[hf2 ] shows the changes of @xmath58 and sha along with @xmath8 for the cases of dilute cupt , cuau and cuhg alloys .",
    "the results of cupt in figs.[hf2](a ) and ( b ) are quite similar to the results of cuir shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "close to the generally realistic value of @xmath8=0.5 ev , both the cuir @xcite and cupt have a sign change of sha between @xmath8=0.3 and 0.4 ev , corresponding to the change of @xmath58 from @xmath8=0.5 ev by as few as about 0.3 electrons . in the experiment of the heavily doped cupt alloys with 10% of pt ,",
    "the charge transfer into the @xmath0 orbitals of pt is 0.25 electrons @xcite .",
    "if it were possible to devise a way to change the @xmath58 in cuir or cupt by about 0.3 electrons , or if the @xmath8 could be altered by about 0.1 ev , the sign of she could be externally controlled .    within the range of @xmath8 from 0 to 1.5 ev , the sign of sha of the cu alloys with @xmath0 impurities from hf to os is stably negative .",
    "there are more sign changes of sha around @xmath8=1.25 ev for cupt and cuau , as shown in figs.[hf2](b ) and ( c ) , but such a large @xmath8 is unlikely to be relevant for @xmath0 impurities .",
    "in contrast to cupt , the changes of @xmath58 and sha in cuau and cuhg are extremely slow with @xmath8 , as shown in figs.[hf2](a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 states of au and hg are nearly fully occupied , and the center of @xmath0 band is so deep below the fermi level that the shift by @xmath8 induces little change of @xmath58 , as shown in fig.[anderson5d ] .",
    "increasing @xmath8 from 0 to 0.5 ev , the decrease of @xmath58 of au and hg is as small as 0.13 and 0.03 electrons , respectively .",
    "also due to the nearly full occupation of the @xmath0 states , the phase shifts of @xmath51 channel are very close to zero and the spin - orbit splits between @xmath59 and @xmath60 states are very small for cuau and cuhg . as shown in figs.[hf2](c ) and ( d ) , with the @xmath8 from zero to around 0.5 ev , the sha function @xmath61 is closer to @xmath57 , rather than @xmath62 ) , indicating that the skew scattering by the soi in @xmath1 orbitals overwhelms the contribution by the soi in @xmath0 orbitals .    in summary , by the combined method of dft+hf",
    ", we analyze the she in the cu alloys with a series of @xmath0 impurities .",
    "we stress that it is necessary to include the soi in both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 orbitals , together with the local correlations in the @xmath0 orbitals of the impurity , to estimate the sha of these alloys .",
    "the results reveal that the sign of sha of cuir and cupt would be sensitive to perturbation of the local correlations , which is favorable for the sign control of she performing as a spin current switch .",
