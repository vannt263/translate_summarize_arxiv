    "exchange interaction is one of the most characteristic quantum effects in many - electron systems . in natural atoms and molecules",
    ", it leads to a singlet - triplet splitting of energy levels and is responsible for a binding of atoms into a molecule . in solids",
    ", it gives rise to a covalent bonding of elemental semiconductors and ferromagnetic properties of metals . in the absence of external fields , the exchange interaction in natural atomic systems is determined by the charges of nuclei and the number of electrons and is essentially fixed .",
    "man - made solid - state analogs of atomic systems , namely , quantum dots ( qd s ) , called also artificial atoms , and coupled qd s ( artificial molecules ) can be fabricated in various designed shapes and sizes .",
    "one can also change the depth and range of the potential confining the electrons .",
    "this gives us a unique opportunity of engineering the quantum states of electrons confined in the qd s and tuning the exchange interaction .",
    "the exchange interaction between electrons in qd s has been proposed as an effective mechanism for changing the electron spin , i.e. , for performing the quantum logic operations on spin qubits.@xcite this mechanism seems to be very promising in quantum information processing with the solid - state nanodevices .",
    "the investigation of the exchange interaction in the qd - based nanodevices allows us to elaborate the methods of controlling and tuning this interaction , which in turn leads to the controlled manipulation of the electron spin qubits.@xcite recently , the exchange - interaction induced spin swap operations in coupled qd s have been simulated by a direct solution of a time - dependent schrdinger equation.@xcite the coherent manipulation of spin qubits in lateral qd s has been studied experimentally by petta et al.,@xcite elzerman et al.,@xcite and hayashi et al.@xcite hatano et al.@xcite determined the tunnel and exchange couplings in laterally coupled vertical qd s .",
    "the quantum logic operations can also be performed in the nanowire double qds.@xcite    the exchange energy is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the lowest triplet and singlet energy levels , respectively . in physics of solid - state nanodevices ,",
    "exchange energy ( [ exch ] ) plays a two - fold role : ( i ) it determines the strength of the exchange interaction ( heisenberg interaction ) , which can swap the spin qubits ; @xcite ( ii ) @xmath0 can be treated as the exchange splitting ( singlet - triplet splitting ) that allows us to distinguish the different spin states of the electron system.@xcite in both the cases , we should know how to tune @xmath0 by applying the external fields .    in the coupled qd system ,",
    "the exchange energy was calculated by several groups.@xcite the effect of an external magnetic field was investigated in papers.@xcite the magnetic field , applied perpendicular to the plane of the electron movement , lowers the energy of the triplet state , which decreases the exchange splitting .",
    "the asymmetry of the qd s gives rise to an enhancement of the exchange interaction.@xcite the size effects in the exchange coupling were studied in papers.@xcite the increasing size of the coupled - qd system leads to the decrease of the exchange energy.@xcite for the two identical elliptic qd s zhang et al.@xcite calculated the exchange energy as a function of aspect ratio @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the extension of the qd in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "they obtained the increase of @xmath0 with increasing @xmath11 for @xmath12@xcite and the sharp variation of @xmath0 as a function of interdot detuning for @xmath13.@xcite the influence of an external electric field on the exchange energy was studied in papers@xcite for vertically coupled self - assembled qd s .",
    "burkard et al.@xcite assumed the harmonic confinement potential and calculated the exchange energy for the vertically coupled qd s using the heitler - london and hund - mulliken techniques .",
    "these results@xcite show the monotonic decrease of the exchange energy with the increasing in - plane electric field .",
    "pedersen et al.@xcite calculated the exchange energy for the harmonic double - dot confinement potential using the numerically exact approach and showed the failure of standard approximations ( i.e. , heitler - london , hund - mulliken , hubbard ) even for simple model systems . in the present paper , we have elaborated a numerical procedure that provides accurate results for the lowest - energy states of the two electrons in laterally coupled qd s . using this method , we have performed a systematic study of qd nanodevices with different geometry and confinement potential profile . in this study , we have applied the confinement potentials with a different softness , i.e. , we have taken into account a variable smoothness of the qd interface.@xcite we have investigated a large class of realistic potentials with the finite depth : from the soft gaussian potential to the hard rectangular - like potential.@xcite    a high fidelity of quantum logic operations on spin qubits can be achieved if the exchange interaction is possibly strong .",
    "this leads to the problem of designing such a nanodevice , in which the exchange interaction is maximal .",
    "a possibility of tuning the exchange interaction with the help of external fields is another important issue of quantum computing in solid - state nanodevices . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the electric - field induced tuning of the exchange interaction in laterally coupled qd s .",
    "we note that the electronic properties of the electrostatically gated qd s @xcite can be tuned by changing the voltages applied to the gates , which changes the potential confining the electrons in the nanodevice .",
    "this leads to another method of tuning the exchange interaction by changing the gate voltages .",
    "in the present paper , we have also investigated this method by studying the effect of the variable range and softness of the confinement potential on the exchange energy . in the gate - defined qds,@xcite the range and softness of the confinement potential",
    "are determined by the voltages applied to the gates.@xcite    the present paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly describe the theoretical model and the computational method used in the calculations .",

    "<S> the effect of external electric field on the exchange interaction has been studied by an exact diagonalization method for two electrons in laterally coupled quantum dots ( qd s ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a systematic study of several nanodevices that contain two gate - defined qd s with different shapes and sizes located between source and drain contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the confinement potential is modelled by two potential wells with a variable range and softness . in all the considered nanodevices , </S>",
    "<S> the overall dependence of exchange energy @xmath0 on electric field @xmath1 is similar , i.e. , for low fields @xmath0 increases with increasing @xmath1 , for intermediate fields @xmath0 reaches a maximum , and rapidly falls down to zero if @xmath1 exceeds a certain critical value . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath2 dependence shows characteristic properties that depend on the nanodevice geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the low- and intermediate - field behaviour can be accurately parametrized by linear function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is independent of the nanodevice geometry and softness of the confinement potential . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the linear @xmath2 dependence appears only if the tunnel coupling between the qd s is weak , i.e. , the interdot separation is sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 dependence becomes non - linear for the strong interdot tunnel coupling . </S>",
    "<S> if the qd located near the contact , to which the higher voltage is applied , possesses the elliptic shape and is larger than the other qd , the @xmath2 dependence shows a plateau in a broad electric - field regime . </S>",
    "<S> the linearity and rapid jumps of @xmath2 as well as the existence of the plateau can be applied to tune the exchange interaction by changing the external electric field . </S>"
