    "the concept of entanglement has been recently considered by many authors [ 1 ] in connection with several properties of the quantum systems and as a potential resource in quantum computation and information processing .",
    "moreover , entanglement has also been recognized to play an important role in the study of many particle quantum systems [ 2 ] and experimental measurement have demonstrated that it can affect macroscopic properties of the condensed matter [ 3 ] .",
    "however , a new area of research has been opened by [ 4 ] , where it was argued that the entanglement ( a quantum observable ) can be used in evaluating the so - called correlation energy : that is the difference between the true eigenvalue energy of a given molecular system , composed by identical components , with respect to that one prescribed by the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation method . in [ 5 ] the case of the formation of the hydrogen molecule was discussed , and a qualitative agreement between the von neumann entropy of either atom ( measuring the entanglement of formation of the whole system ) and the correlation energy as functions of the inter - nuclear distance was shown .",
    "however , the extension of this idea to multi - atomic molecules and its effectiveness remains still unclear [ 6,7 ] .",
    "+ the correlation energy in this context is an artifact of the approximation procedure , then it is not a physical observable and , by second , it can be modified by the adopted method of calculations . in this sense",
    "the conjecture of [ 5 ] is not a well posed question and the answer to it must be only qualitative .",
    "nevertheless , folk says that still entanglement has to play some role in taking into account the difference between the approximated computation of the ( fundamental ) energy level for a typical factorized wave function , as provided by the hartree - fock approximation , and the @xmath0true@xmath0 energy eigenvalue .",
    "this paper is devoted to a deeper analysis of it , trying to find an operative and quantitative estimation of the entanglement effects on the energy level evaluation by approximated methods .",
    "better , one would like to clarify if the correlation energy is in a one - to - one correspondence with the entanglement of the fundamental state of bipartite systems .",
    "to this aim we analyze a very simple model of coupled harmonic oscillators introduced by m. moshinsky about 40 years ago in the paper [ 8 ] , and try to arrive to a quantitative measurement of the entanglement effects on the correlation energy .    in sec .",
    "2 we briefly review the moshinsky s model , pointing out the goodness of the hf approximation for the fundamental state , both considering the correlation energy and the fidelity with respect to the exact solution and for weak couplings of the two oscillators . in sec .",
    "3 we evaluate the von neumann entropy , which is the unique measure of entanglement for pure states , for the fundamental state of the moshinsky s model , by tracing out the density matrix operator w.r.t .",
    "one of the component oscillator .",
    "eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix are computed by discussing certain integral equations . in order to compare the von neumann entropy and the correlation energy , in sec .",
    "4 we consider the minimized mean squared deviations of the two quantities . a discussion of the relative deviations is also performed .",
    "furthermore an analytic expression of the entropy in terms of the correlation energy is provided .",
    "a comparison with the analogous expressions for the two point ising model is discussed .",
    "asymptotic formulae for very small couplings ( or correlation energy ) are considered at the end .",
    "some final remarks are addressed in the conclusions .",
    "in order to evaluate the efficiency and how good the hf mean field method is in computing quantum states , moshinsky in [ 8 ] proposed a very simple , but non trivial , model of two coupled spin-@xmath1 harmonic oscillators in 3 dimensions , in which all computations can be analytically performed up to the end .",
    "+ in adimensional unities , the hamiltonian of the model reads    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the position and the momentum operators of the i - th particle , respectively .",
    "the constant _ k _ parametrizes the interaction strength of a supplementary harmonic coupling between the two oscillators .",
    "one can interprete such as a model for two identical interacting atoms ( or molecules ) .",
    "thus , the coupling would represent the interatomic interaction , which one can conjecture weaker than the electron - nucleus interaction .",
    "thus , we will dwell upon the case _ 0 @xmath5 k @xmath5 1 _ and the coupling term in ( 1 ) will be considered as a perturbative term .",
    "so changing the value of _ k _ may be interpreted as a change into the interatomic interaction .",
    "finally , let us observe that since we are interested into the fundamental state , the spinorial aspect of the problem is not relevant .",
    "in fact , the total spin state must be singlet . for self - consistency of the present paper , here review the moshinsky s results .",
    "+ the energy spectrum of the system can be easily computed in the form    @xmath6    where _ m _ and _",
    "n _ are positive integers or 0 . for any _ _ k _ _ the spectrum shows degeneracy , partially broken for @xmath7 however , the lowest level is always simple .",
    "moreover , eigenvalue crossings occur for higher eigenvalues at isolated points of _ k . _   + the normalized wave function of the fundamental level is given by _ _",
    "@xmath8    where the mean and relative position have been defined , @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "looking at the spin state of the system one can see that it is always entangled .",
    "so the question is if also the positional factor has the properties of an entangled state .",
    "+ applying the standard hf mean field approximation to the ground state , one is led to the wave function    @xmath11    corresponding to the approximated eigenvalue    @xmath12    defining the _ correlation energy _ as    @xmath13    one obtains a first indication of how good the hf approximation is . for simplicity",
    "this is reported in fig .",
    "[ 1_gr1 ] .    of course , by ritz s theorem one has @xmath14 , but the approximation looks very good for small _",
    "k _ , indeed they differ at the second order near _ k _ = 0 as @xmath15 so that the relative error is less than 3.5@xmath16 in the range of @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the explicit expression of the overlap ( or the squared fidelity ) of the exact and the hf wave function @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 is @xmath20 the graph of which is shown in fig . [",
    "1_gr2 ] .",
    "it is immediate to see that the distance between the two wave - functions is less than 95@xmath16 for _ 0 @xmath5 k @xmath5 1 _ .",
    "+ thus , one can figure out that adding to the hf state further corrections surely improve the estimations of the energy eigenvalue and increase the fidelity , but the simplest factorized expression in ( 4 ) will be lost .",
    "indeed , this is the case if one considers the exact expression of @xmath21(@xmath22,@xmath23 ) in ( 3 ) .",
    "qualitatively this means that the two oscillators in the correct fundamental state are entangled , contrary to what happens in the approximated state .",
    "thus , one would like to attribute the mismatch between the energy of the two states ( i.e. @xmath24 ) to the entanglement properties .",
    "we will analyze this idea in the next section .",
    "as it is well known , the main estimator of the entanglement for pure states is the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath25 of one of the component subsystems , i.e.    @xmath26=-\\text{tr}\\left[\\hat{\\rho } _ 1 \\ , \\log _ { 2}\\hat{\\rho } _",
    "1\\right],\\text {   } \\text{with}\\text {      } \\hat{\\rho } _ 1 = \\text{tr}_2\\left[\\hat{\\rho } \\right]\\ ] ]    where in the second relation one has traced out only with respect to the second subsystem , when a proper basis of states has been chosen in the hilbert space of the whole system . in the position - spin representation the complete system density matrix @xmath27 for the fundamental state ( 3 ) is given by    @xmath28    @xmath29    where one has introduced the supplementary variables @xmath30 = @xmath31 and @xmath32 = @xmath33 .",
    "an analogous expression holds for the @xmath34@xmath35 state ( 4 ) .",
    "the main difference between the two functions is that in the latter case the density matrix reduces in just the product of gaussian normal distributions in the real variables ( @xmath36,@xmath37,@xmath38,@xmath39 ) , with the same variance .",
    "instead , in the case of density matrix ( 10 ) the different coefficients in front of ( @xmath40+@xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42+@xmath43 ) make the presence of mixed ( entangling ) terms of the form @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 and @xmath47@xmath45@xmath39 .",
    "this has consequences also at level of one particle space distribution density , which is given by    @xmath48    which differs significantly from the one particle density obtained from the hf state , i.e. + @xmath49 as , for instance , it can be graphically seen in fig . 3 for a particular value of _ k_.    thus , in the exact state the mean squared deviation in the position measurements of one particle , regardless the other one , results greater than in the approximated case by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "correspondingly , the mean squared deviations for the modulus of the linear momentum are smaller , by the inverse of the above factor , in the exact case with respect to the hf one .    the analytic 1-particle spacial density matrix operator can be given in position representation @xmath51 = @xmath52 by the kernel @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we have to use into expression ( 9 ) in order to compute the corresponding von neumann entropy .",
    "actually , one has to take account also of the spin state .",
    "but , a well known property of the von neumann entropy says that    @xmath54 = s_{\\text{vn}}\\left[\\hat { \\rho } \\right]\\text {   } + \\text {   } s_{\\text{vn}}\\left[\\hat { \\sigma } \\right],\\ ] ]    for any factorized density operator @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 .",
    "since this is the case for the system we are considering , where the reduced matrix in the spin space state is @xmath1 proportional to the identity matrix , the von neumann entropy for the one - particle subsystem can be defined modulo a constant term equal to 1 .",
    "furthermore , the expression ( 9 ) becomes @xmath58= - \\sum _ { i } \\mu _ { i } \\ , { log}_2 \\left ( { } \\mu _ { i } \\right)$ ] in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath59 of the operator @xmath60 , which is acting on the infinite dimensional space of squared sommable functions .",
    "so , the eigenvalue problem for @xmath51 can be written in the form    @xmath61    as one can see from eq .",
    "( 14 ) , the kernel of this integral equation is symmetric .",
    "moreover , it is of hilbert - schmidt type , since the coefficient of @xmath62 is negative .",
    "so the spectrum is real and discrete .",
    "finally , in cartesian coordinates it can be decomposed in the product of three one - dimensional kernels with the same gaussian structure    @xmath63 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    accordingly , the eigenfunctions of eq . ( 16 ) can be factorized in the product of three functions , each of them depending only on one real variable .",
    "thus we put for the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues    @xmath64    so that the problem is reduced to solve the integral spectral problem in one dimension    @xmath65    recalling the standard formulae for gaussian integrals [ 9 ]    @xmath66    it is natural to look for solutions of eq .",

    "( 19 ) reduces to _",

    "however , the particular form of the coefficients in the r.h.s . of formula ( 20 ) makes this problem triangular , so one can easily provide the non degenerate spectrum    @xmath71    where @xmath72    of course , these eigenvalues are positive and their sum is equal to 1 , because related to a matrix density operator . on the other hand , accordingly to ( 18 ) the eigenvalues of the one - particle density matrix ( 14 ) are given by    @xmath73    thus the eigenvalue @xmath74 is degenerate of order @xmath75=\\frac{k^2}{2}+\\frac{3 k}{2}+1.\\ ] ]    for comparison in fig .",
    "4 we report the graphs of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    hence , if we are allowed to interprete the eigenvalues of the density matrix operator @xmath78 as the probabilities to find the one particle subsystem in the states of a _ k_-parametrized family of harmonic oscillators , for the fundamental one it is very close to 1 and slowly decreasing in _",

    "moreover , we have quite simple algebraic relations in terms of the concurrence ( see eq .",
    "( [ enconcmoapp ] ) ) . however , at the moment we have not a general method to compute directly the coefficients of such type of expansions",

    "we have shown also that the overlap of the exact wave functions with the corresponding hf approximations are in a one - to - one correspondence with the correlation energy and the entanglement .",
    "in particular a monotonic decreasing of the overlap occurs as a function of the entanglement , with a non analytic behavior at the origin .",
    "differently as above , such a type of relation may be useful in the estimation of the entanglement , which could be quite complicated to compute for bipartite systems with high inner degrees of freedom , as the dimers of complex molecules ( see [ 6 - 7 ] for instance ) .",
    "finally , we would stress that if a general principle of nature would state that it is impossible to create ( or increase ) entanglement between remote quantum systems by local operations [ 11 ] ( in analogy with the second law of the thermodynamics ) , expressions like ( 32 ) may suggest proper modifications in presence of globally controlled operations , analogous to the isothermal transformations . in this respect ,",
