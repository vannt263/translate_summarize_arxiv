    "pic simulations discussed above demonstrate that the growth of the maximal electric field in the two - stream instability in a short system compared to an infinite plasma can be very large .",
    "it is necessary to mention , however , that these simulations are carried out with certain simplifications similar to those made in the fluid model . in particular ,",
    "the sheath is not resolved , the ion background is immobile , and collisions with neutrals are omitted .",
    "the realistic sheath will allow some energetic plasma electrons to escape and may affect the structure of the wave interacting with the beam .",
    "if the ion dynamics is accounted for , the strong plasma oscillations may result in the modulation instability which will create density cavities and affect the wave .",
    "finally , the two stream instability can be suppressed by electron - neutral collisions if the collision frequency is more than two times the collisionless growth rate . in very short systems ,",
    "the temporal growth rate is very small , which means that the neutrals present in a real beam - plasma system may simply prevent the instability from developing .",
    "in summary , we have studied the development of the two - stream instability in a finite size plasma bounded by electrodes both analytically and making use of fluid and particle - in - cell simulations .",
    "we show that the instability reaches the asymptotic state when the wave structure has the same spatial profile and grows in time with a constant growth rate .",
    "the spatial structure of the wave is close to a standing wave but has a spatial growth along the beam propagation .",
