    "among a large diversity of phenomena investigated in the scope of deterministic chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems one finds _ crises _ @xcite .",
    "these are sudden changes in the structure of a chaotic attractor due to collision with an unstable periodic orbit when a system parameter @xmath0 crosses some critical value @xmath1 .    in the dynamics",
    "after crisis ( for @xmath2 ) characteristic transients appear ; the system spends some time on the former ( pre - crisis ) attractor which is now a chaotic saddle . in the case of a _ boundary crisis _ the transient",
    "is followed by a definitive escape to some other attractor in the phase space while after an _ interior crisis _ transients are interrupted by ( typically short ) bursts to an extension of the pre - crisis attractor .",
    "attractor merging crisis _",
    "we have intermittent jumps between symmetric pre - crisis attractors .",
    "such a behaviour is called _ crisis - induced chaos - chaos intermittency_. for a large class of dynamical systems the time @xmath3 that the system stays on the pre - crisis attractor has an exponential distribution @xmath4 with a mean value @xmath5 fulfilling a power scaling low    @xmath6    for two - dimensional maps , the exponent @xmath7 can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the periodic orbit involved in the crisis @xcite .",
    "the power low ( [ e2 ] ) and the formulas for the critical exponent @xmath8 @xcite have been confirmed in many numerical and experimental studies ( e.g. @xcite ) . throughout the recent years many other aspects of crises @xcite as well as new types of crises @xcite has been investigated .",
    "however , it has also been noticed @xcite that the power low ( [ e2 ] ) describes only the general tendency of the function @xmath9 , and one can observe some oscillations imposed on it .",
    "they can result from a ragged ( fractal ) measure of chaotic attractor colliding with its basin of attraction @xcite ; in the case of homoclinic crisis their period on a log - log plot of @xmath9 is @xmath10 , and their amplitude is large for small @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the contracting eigenvalue of the crisis orbit .",
    "these oscillations are indicated as a potential complication to verifying the scaling low ( [ e2 ] ) and determining the critical exponent @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate another kind of oscillations that , in general , can be more pronounced , and arises from an intertwined structure of the basins of attraction @xcite .",
    "their particular feature is the existence of sections where the average characteristic time @xmath5 grows up when moving off the crisis point , opposite to the general trend ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we call them _ anomalous oscillations_. oscillations of this kind have been observed in a 1d map describing a diode resonator @xcite and presumably in many other systems but , to our knowledge , they were not explicitly pointed out .",
    "we estimate the period and calculate the amplitude of these basin - induced oscillations using a simple model of an attractor colliding with its basin boundary .",
    "first let us briefly introduce a spin model in which the anomalous oscillations can be explicitly observed .",
    "after the papers @xcite , we consider a classical magnetic moment ( spin ) @xmath13 in the field of uniaxial anisotropy ( @xmath14 easy / hard axis ) with imposed transversal magnetic field @xmath15 along the @xmath16 axis .",
    "the system can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the anisotropy constant .",
    "such a model can describe a magnetic ion in a paramagnetic material or a single domain ferromagnetic sample .",
    "the motion of the spin is determined by the landau - lifschitz equation with damping term :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the effective magnetic field and @xmath21 is a damping parameter .",
    "taking the driving field in the form of periodic delta pulses of amplitude @xmath22 and period @xmath23 : @xmath24 , and using the fact that @xmath25 is constant , the equation of motion ( [ e4 ] ) can be transformed into a superposition of two 2d maps @xcite : @xmath26 describing the time evolution between kicks and @xmath27 describing the effect of the kick .",
    "the complete dynamics is yielded as a composition of the two maps :    @xmath28 = t_b[t_a[s_z,\\varphi ] ] ,     \\label{e8}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the angle between the axis @xmath16 and the projection of the spin on the @xmath30 plane . for different values of the parameters the system exhibits various types of dynamics including the periodic and chaotic ones",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    as an example , consider the crisis that occurs at @xmath31 and @xmath32 in which two symmetric chaotic attractors merge @xcite .",
    "the attractors correspond to two ising states ( spin `` up '' and `` down '' ) existing in the absence of the external field .",
    "we take the amplitude of the driving field @xmath22 as an accessible system parameter . for @xmath33 random jumps between the two ,",
    "previously separate attractors can be observed ;    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the dependence of the average time @xmath5 between two subsequent switches on the distance @xmath34 from the crisis point in a log - log scale .",
    "we observe a linear trend according to ( [ e2 ] ) with the exponent @xmath35 ( dashed line ) @xcite .",
    "however , a remarkable , roughly periodic oscillations around the trend line can also be seen .",
    "these oscillations include _ anomalous _ sections where @xmath5 increases when moving away from the crisis point .",
    "the oscillations are due to an intertwined , fractal structure of the basins of attraction of the symmetric pre - crisis attractors . to see this ,",
    "consider the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where a part of attractor is plotted together with pseudo - basin of attraction ( gray spots ) of the other , symmetric attractor .",
    "in fact , after crisis there is only one common attractor and almost all points of the phase space form its basin , but for @xmath36 we can define _ pseudo - basins _ as sets of initial conditions evolving to the `` upper '' ( @xmath37 ) or the `` lower '' ( @xmath38 ) attractor respectively after @xmath39 iterations , where @xmath40 ; in fig .  [ fig2 ] we took @xmath41 .",
    "the structure of pseudo - basins is much similar to the real basins before crisis . in what follows",
    ", we shall refer to the post - crisis pseudo - basin of attraction of the other attractor as the basin of escape .",
    "the average transient time @xmath5 is proportional to the inverse of the measure @xmath42 of the part of attractor overlapping with the basin of escape @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( a ) the branch @xmath43 of the attractor crossed the band @xmath44 of the basin of escape and is just before the next band @xmath45 .",
    "this corresponds to a local maximum in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . when the parameter @xmath22 is increased @xmath43 enters the band @xmath45 , so @xmath42 grows and @xmath5 decreases until @xmath43 touches the lower edge of @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "then the total overlap @xmath42 begins to _ decrease _ and we observe an anomalous section in fig .",
    "but simultaneously another branch @xmath46 enters the basin of escape , so the anomalous section is not as pronounced as in the `` clean '' case when @xmath43 crosses @xmath44 .    if the band @xmath44 is magnified by a factor of @xmath47 a structure similar to that on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] could be observed ; the procedure could be repeated further on .",
    "this explains the fact that the mean period of oscillations in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] is approximately @xmath48 .",
    "motivated by the observed self - similarity we introduce a simple model of an attractor creeping into an intertwined basin of escape in order to assess the amplitude of anomalous oscillations .",
    "we define the basin in the vicinity of a collision point as a self - similar set @xmath49 of stripes of the width @xmath50 accumulating at the line @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) :    @xmath52    @xmath53 is the width of the gaps in the basin of escape that may be called `` return regions '' . the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 fulfil the condition @xmath56 .    as a model attractor",
    "we take a single parabola @xmath57 .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 corresponds to the distance @xmath59 from the crisis point in ( [ e2 ] ) . at @xmath60",
    "the attractor collides with the basin @xmath49 ( crisis occurs ) . for @xmath61",
    "there is a nonzero overlap of both sets .",
    "we assume the average transient time @xmath62 proportional to the inverse of the measure @xmath63 of the overlapping region ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the function @xmath62 in log - log scale obtained from the described model . due to self similarity of the model basin @xmath49",
    ", we observe regular oscillations with the period @xmath64 superimposed on the linear trend described by ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "our aim is to calculate the amplitude @xmath65 of the anomalous oscillations measured as the difference between a maximum and the preceding minimum , see fig .",
    "consider one @xmath66-th period of the oscillation . by our definition    @xmath67",
    "where @xmath68 , a @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    for small @xmath58 ,",
    "the length of parabola in the half - plane @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath71 . using this approximation the measure of the overlap @xmath42 at points @xmath72 and",
    "@xmath73 can be written as    @xmath74    here we neglected all the strips with @xmath75 in ( [ frba ] ) . from ( [ e421 ] ) and ( [ miodr242 ] ) we get    @xmath76    where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the base of the logarithm in the plot @xmath79 vs. @xmath80 ( in this letter we use @xmath81 ) .",
    "one can also calculate the slope of the linear trend , getting @xmath82 because of a 1d model - attractor .",
    "analytical and numerical calculations considering other model - attractors show that the fractal structure of the basin of escape does not influence the slope @xmath8 .",
    "the formula ( [ delfbb ] ) has been verified by comparing the calculated @xmath65 with the amplitudes of anomalous oscillations measured on the log - log charts @xmath9 , obtained from computer simulations of the spin map ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "we investigated the intermittent dynamics near four different crisis points of the same kind as the one described above , and we made respective plots @xmath83 , similar to fig .",
    "the results are gathered in table 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 used in ( [ delfbb ] ) have been measured employing a series of consecutive magnifications of the basin boundary at @xmath86 ( similar to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "much the same values of @xmath84 can be obtained as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the average period of anomalous oscillations measured as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "note , that the amplitudes of anomalous oscillations calculated from ( [ delfbb ] ) are close to the maximal amplitudes observed in the simulations of the map ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "this can be understood noting that the maximal amplitude corresponds to a `` clear '' situation when a branch of attractor which may be considered as one parabola ( its fractal fine structure may be ignored ) leaves a band of the basin while no other branch collides with any other basin band .",
    "it is just the case considered in our model crisis .",
    "conversely , if one branch of attractor leaves a basin band and simultaneously another branch enters the same or some other band , both effects can cancel and no pronounced peak is observed .",
    "thus , ( [ delfbb ] ) gives the _ maximal _ amplitude of anomalous oscillations .",
    "we also studied a homoclinic boundary crisis that occurs in the hnon map , @xmath89 at @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "if we make the @xmath92-scale plot of @xmath9 ( here @xmath5 is the length of chaotic transient before the escape to infinity , averaged over a set of initial conditions ) measuring @xmath5 with appropriate accuracy , and marking subsequent points dense enough we can see tiny anomalous peaks with average period 0.97 and average amplitude ( defined as on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) 0.1 .",
    "these oscillations are superimposed on the linear trend ( [ e2 ] ) and , here dominating , oscillations due to the ragged measure of the chaotic attractor .",
    "a few consecutive magnifications of the fractal basin boundary gives the model parameter values @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the formula ( [ delfbb ] ) then gives @xmath95 .",
    "this value is again close to the maximal amplitude observed ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "note , that the average period of anomalous oscillations is approximately @xmath97 .",
    "the presented model used to obtain the maximal amplitude of anomalous oscillations is a simple one . in real basins of attraction every strip of @xmath98 may have its own fine structure and chaotic attractor is locally an infinite fractal set of parabolas .",
    "nevertheless , the model comprises the main properties of both sets responsible for the anomalous oscillations and gives a proper estimate of their maximal amplitude .",
    "anomalous oscillations seem to be quite common in nonlinear dynamical systems , as do the fractal , intertwined basin boundaries that give rise to them .",
    "they are , however , easy to confuse with statistical dispersion of the mean times @xmath5 , especially when one has a small number of points on @xmath9 plots . the presence of anomalous oscillations can be a complication to verify the scaling low ( [ e2 ] ) , but if one is able to detect and measure them , they can give additional information on the structure of basins of attraction near crises .",
    "note , that both @xmath65 and @xmath84 can be , in principle , assessed from the plot ( like in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and eqn .",
    "( [ delfbb ] ) can be used to derive @xmath85 .",
    "a model of chaotic attractor similar to that of the basin of attraction lets us calculate the amplitude of `` normal '' oscillations caused by the fractal structure of the attractor @xcite .    concluding , we have observed anomalous oscillations of average characteristic crisis - induced transient times , and explained them in terms of a simple , geometric model , which gives the period of the oscillations and enables to calculate with a fair accuracy their maximal amplitude .",
    "the model is universal , and the results are applicable to a large class of 2d systems undergoing different types of crises",
    ". it could be also customized for some special non generic cases .",
