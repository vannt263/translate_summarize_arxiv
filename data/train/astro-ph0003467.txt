    "the number of triple systems with well - determined orbital elements is still small ( fekel 1981 ; tokovinin 1997 , 1999 ) . in particular ,",
    "the number of spectroscopic triples in which the wide orbit is also known from radial - velocity observations is very small .",
    "part of the problem is that the velocity amplitude of the outer binary is usually small compared to the amplitude of the inner binary .",
    "moreover , after a binary orbit has been solved , the natural reaction is to discontinue observing it , and checks for longer - term variations are rarely made @xcite .",
    "this series of papers is aimed at increasing our knowledge of triples by investigating systems where the inner and outer orbits can both be determined from spectroscopic observations .",
    "the first paper of the series ( mazeh , krymolowski and latham 1993 , hereinafter paper i ) examined the halo triple g38 - 13 , while the second paper ( krymolowski and mazeh 1998 , hereinafter paper ii ) derived an analytic technique which allows for fast simulation of orbital modulations of a binary induced by a third star .    in the present paper",
    "we analyse the triple - lined spectroscopic triple system hd 109648 ( hip 61497 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( j2000 ) ; @xmath2 ) .",
    "hd 109648 was identified as one ( star 6 ) of a handful of stars belonging to the remnant of a nearby old open cluster , upgren  1 @xcite , but subsequent studies have weakened the interpretation that all of the stars originally identified are physically associated ( upgren , philip & beavers 1982 ; gatewood et al .",
    "1992 ; stefanik et al .",
    "1997 ; baumgardt 1998 ) .",
    "the triple - lined nature of hd 109648 was noticed soon after we began observing it , because the one - dimensional correlations of some of the spectra clearly showed three peaks .",
    "a periodicity analysis revealed periods at @xmath3 and @xmath4 days .",
    "triple systems tend to be hierarchical , usually with a close binary and a more distant third star , as other configurations are generally unstable and are unlikely to persist and be detected . to first - order",
    ", a hierarchical triple system can be separated into an inner orbit ( comprising the two close stars ) and an outer orbit ( comprising the third star and the centre - of - mass of the inner pair ) .",
    "this approximation is most valid when the distance to the third star far exceeds the separation between the inner two stars .",
    "one of the goals of this study is to investigate the interaction of these three stars ( through the variation of the inner and outer orbits ) to higher order .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was presented at a conference entitled ` thirty years of astronomy at the van vleck observatory : a meeting in honor of arthur r. upgren ' @xcite .",
    "this paper updates the orbital solutions presented there and adds a significantly more detailed analysis of the system , partly through the use of numerical simulations .",
    "in section 2 we summarise the analysis of the observations , including the derivation of the radial velocities , orbital solutions , and additional parameters such as the mass ratios and constraints on the orbital inclinations .",
    "we discuss the theoretically expected modulations of orbital elements in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we describe our efforts to search for such variations and present our results .",
    "further constraints for the system via numerical simulation are derived in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss our results and relate them to previous and future work .",
    "hd 109648 has been monitored since 1990 with the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) digital speedometer @xcite on the 1.5-m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory , located in the town of harvard , massachusetts .",
    "the echelle spectra cover 45   centered at 5187  , with a spectral resolution of @xmath5 . as of 1998 , we have secured 290 spectra of hd109648 .",
    "radial velocities were derived for each of the three stars in the system using the three - dimensional version @xcite of the two - dimensional correlation technique todcor @xcite .",
    "todcor assumes that the spectrum for each individual star in the system is known , and that an observed spectrum is composed of the individual component spectra added together , each shifted by its own radial velocity .",
    "thus , to use todcor successfully one must have suitable template spectra for each of the components .",
    "we chose our templates from a grid of synthetic spectra calculated by jon morse using the 1992 kurucz model atmospheres ( e.g. nordstrm et al . 1994 ) .",
    "our first guess for the template parameters was based on a visual inspection of the spectra .",
    "application of todcor yielded preliminary velocities for each of the three components , from which we determined the makeup of the triple : the inner binary consists of the primary and the tertiary , while the outer star is second in brightness . with this information",
    ", we were able to refine our templates to obtain the final velocities .",
    "for the primary we adopted an effective temperature , @xmath6 k ; solar metallicity , [ m / h ] = 0 ; and main - sequence surface gravity , log @xmath7 ( cgs units ) .",
    "the period of the inner binary is quite short , and we assumed this has led to spin - orbit synchronization for the inner stars ( see for example mazeh & shaham 1979 ) .",
    "therefore we adopted a rotational velocity of @xmath8  for both of the inner binary stars . for the secondary and the tertiary",
    ", we have used a slightly cooler temperature , @xmath9 k , and for the outer star we assumed that the rotation was negligible , @xmath10 .",
    "small changes in the choice of template parameters did not have much effect on the radial velocities or orbital solutions .",
    "the final template parameters are listed in table [ tab - temparm ] , and the individual radial velocities are reported in the appendix ."
