    "the standard model ( sm ) predicts that photons are predominantly left - handed in @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) decay ( and right - handed in @xmath10 ) . in the presence of new physics this prediction",

    "this shows that the contributions of the higher kaon resonances are likely very small and can be neglected .",
    "our results demonstrate that the nonresonant contribution to the mixing - induced cp asymmetry is negligibly small , and the sm contamination is dominated by the right - handed photon amplitude in @xmath87 , parameterized by @xmath88 .",
    "our results show that averaging the nonresonant and resonant measurements of the @xmath6 parameter is a justified procedure .",
    "we studied in this paper the standard model prediction for the mixing - induced cp asymmetry parameter in @xmath89 decay .",
    "this decay is important as a probe for new physics manifested through a right - handed photon in @xmath3 decay .",
    "the naive expectation @xcite for the @xmath6 parameter in the sm is @xmath90 .",
    "we computed the corrections to this prediction introduced by strong interaction effects .    in the kinematical region with @xmath91 and a soft pion in the rest frame of the b meson , there is a unique sm mechanism contributing to the @xmath6 parameter at leading order in @xmath92 , arising from the @xmath93 pole diagrams .",
    "these effects are factorizable and calculable using a combination of scet and heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , power suppressed effects can introduce a potentially sizeable contamination from nonfactorizable graphs with the photon coupling to the charm quark loop  @xcite .",
    "these are difficult to compute in a reliable way , and a simple power counting estimate allows a right - handed photon amplitude as large as @xmath94 .",
    "we performed a detailed numerical study of the nonresonant effects .",
    "we find that the leading order @xmath93 pole effect is numerically small .",
    "it introduces a weak dependence of the cp asymmetry @xmath25 on @xmath54 .",
    "the dominant sm contamination is from power suppressed effects in the @xmath87 resonant amplitude , and our best estimate in the @xmath54 dependent asymmetry is @xmath95 ( see fig .  4 ) .    when integrated over @xmath54 , the nonresonant effect is practically negligible , and the cp asymmetry @xmath25 is dominated by the resonant @xmath96 amplitude .",
    "this means that averaging the results of the resonant and nonresonant measurements , as currently done at b factories , is a justified procedure .",
    "if improved measurements of the cp asymmetry confirm the present average @xmath97 , this would be consistent with a power suppressed correction in the sm .",
    "we reiterate that the naive estimate @xmath98 seriously underestimates the value of the @xmath6 parameter in the sm .",
    "furthermore , one would also expect the agreement between resonant and nonresonant measurements to improve .",
