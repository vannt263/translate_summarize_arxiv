    "the effect of particle creation by strong electromagnetic and gravitational fields has a pure quantum nature . depending on the structure of such external backgrounds ,",
    "different approaches have been proposed for calculating the effect .",
    "initially , the effect of particle creation was considered for time - dependent external electric fields that are switched on and off at the initial and final time instants , respectively .",
    "we call such external fields the @xmath2-electric potential steps . scattering , particle creation from the vacuum , and particle annihilation by the @xmath2-electric potential steps has been considered in the framework of the relativistic quantum mechanics , see refs .  @xcite ; a more complete list of relevant publications can be found in refs .",
    "at present it is well understood that only an adequate quantum field theory ( qft ) with the corresponding external background may consistently describe this effect and possible accompanying  processes . in the framework of such a theory , particle creation",
    "is related to a violation of the vacuum stability with time .",
    "backgrounds ( external fields ) that may violate the vacuum stability have to be able to produce nonzero work when interacting with the corresponding particles . in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , these are electriclike electromagnetic fields . a general formulation of qed with @xmath3-electric potential steps  was developed in refs .",
    "however , there exist many physically interesting situations where external backgrounds are not formally switched off at the time infinity , the corresponding backgrounds formally being not @xmath2-electric potential steps . as an example",
    ", we may point out time - independent nonuniform electric fields that are concentrated in restricted space areas .",
    "the latter fields represent a kind of spatial ( or , as we call them , conditionally ) @xmath4-electric potential steps for charged particles .",
    "the @xmath4-electric potential steps can also create particles from the vacuum ; the klein paradox is closely related to this process @xcite .",
    "approaches for treating quantum effects in the explicitly time - dependent external fields are not directly applicable to the @xmath4-electric potential steps .",
    "some heuristic calculations of particle creation by @xmath4-electric potential steps in the framework of the relativistic quantum mechanics with qualitative discussion from the point of view of qft were first presented by nikishov in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our recent article gavgit15",
    ", we presented a consistent formulation of qed with @xmath4-electric potential steps quantizing the dirac and the klein - gordon ( scalar ) fields in the presence of such steps in terms of adequate and -particles .",
    "we developed a nonperturbative calculation technique for different quantum processes such as scattering , reflection , and electron - positron pair creation .",
    "as in the case of qed with @xmath2-electric potential steps this technique essentially uses special sets of exact solutions of the dirac equation with the corresponding external field of @xmath4-electric potential steps .",
    "the cases when such solutionscan be found explicitly ( analytically )  are  called exactly solvable cases . in qed with @xmath2-electric potential steps there",
    "exist a few exactly solvable cases .",
    "the first ( conditionally ) is the so - called @xmath5-constant electric field , which is a uniform electric field that efficiently acts during a sufficiently large but finite time @xmath5 .",
    "quantum processes including particle creation in the latter field were studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and used for a number of applications @xcite .",
    "one can also point out other exactly solvable cases , such as the sauter - like electric field @xmath6narnik70 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and an exponentially decreasing electric field @xcite . in the recently constructed qed with @xmath4-electric potential steps",
    "an important exactly solvable case of the sauter field @xmath7 was considered in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite as an illustration of the general theory . in the present article",
    "we consider the second exactly solvable case of @xmath4-electric potential steps , namely the so - called @xmath0-constant electric field .",
    "such a step represents a constant electric field situated between two planes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , is uniform there and directed along the axis @xmath4 , see sec .",
    "in fact , this is a uniform electric field confined between two capacitor plates separated by a finite distance @xmath0 .",
    "some heuristic calculations of the particle creation effect by such a field in the framework of the relativistic quantum mechanics were presented in ref .",
    "the @xmath0-constant electric field is an analog of the @xmath5-constant field .",
    "we stress that the @xmath5-constant and @xmath0-constant electric fields describe different physical situations in the general case .",
    "however , in the limiting case , when both @xmath11 and @xmath12 , they represent the same uniform constant electric field , which is obviously an idealization .",
    "nevertheless , such a field allows exact solutions and has been frequently used in various calculations in qed , particularly in the pioneering work of schwinger @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these calculations are relatively simple due to the  translational symmetry of the field ; however they always contain divergences related to the infinite duration of the field action and to the infinite volume of the consideration . in this",
    "respect calculations in the @xmath5-constant and @xmath0-constant electric fields can be considered as a kind of different regularization in the case of the constant uniform electric field .",
    "the study of the vacuum instability  in the presence of potential steps  in particular , particle creation in the @xmath0-constant electric field  is quite important for various applications .",
    "for example , it is important in the study of particle emission from black holes and quark and neutron stars , due to a close relation between particle creation by strong electrostatic potentials and the unruh effect ; see , e.g. , ruffini , chm08 for reviews .",
    "the corresponding limiting case of a constant uniform electric field has many similarities with the case of the de sitter background , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "recent progress in laser physics allows one to hope that particle creation effect will be experimentally observed in the near future in laboratory conditions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "methods of qft with strong potential steps are currently being developed in condensed matter physics , and particle creation by external fields has become an observable effect in physics of graphene and similar nanostructures ( say , in topological insulators and  weyl semimetals ) ; this area is currently under intense development , see the reviews @xcite . in particular , the particle creation effect is crucial for understanding the conductivity of graphene , especially in the so - called nonlinear regime . electron - hole pair creation ( which is an analog of the electron - positron pair creation from the vacuum ) was recently observed in graphene by its indirect influence on the graphene conductivity @xcite .",

    "this spectrum was interpreted as a planck distribution with the temperature @xmath421 ( @xmath422 is the boltzmann constant ) . as before @xmath423 for fermions and @xmath288 for bosons .",
    "it is also known unruh76 that an observer with a constant acceleration @xmath424 ( with respect to its proper time ) will register some particles ( rindler particles ) in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the mean numbers of rindler bosons have the same planck form as ( [ ec1 ] ) ( with @xmath288 ) , where one has to replace @xmath425 by @xmath424 , so that the corresponding temperature is @xmath426 .",
    "one can find many other examples when particle creation in external gravitation fields ( and due to a nontrivial topology ) can be described by means of an effective temperature ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .    the distribution ( [ l22 ] ) obtained for the @xmath0-constant field does not have a thermal form at first blush .",
    "nevertheless , in the framework of a semiclassical consideration and using some results of the present paper one can find a close connection to a thermal - like form .",
    "as established , both electrons and positrons with given transversal momentum @xmath427 and zero longitudinal momentum are created in a subregion of the region @xmath428 with the kinetic and rest energy @xmath429 per particle . at the same time , the created electrons and positrons are accelerated by the electric field along the axis @xmath4 to the left and to the right , respectively .",
    "note that in the subrange @xmath273 , where a stabilization condition for @xmath232 holds , the width @xmath430 of the pair formation subregion is small compared to the distance @xmath0 . finally , the particles appear on the left and the right of the step already having ultrarelativistic velocities and longitudinal momenta @xmath431 and @xmath432 , respectively , given by eq .",
    "( [ l3 ] ) .",
    "using classical equations of motion in a constant uniform electric field @xmath433 , one finds final accelerations for both kinds of particles as @xmath434respectively .",
    "we can improve the classical consideration by taking into account properties of the physical vacuum in the @xmath0-constant field . within the general construction  @xcite",
    ", it is assumed  that electrons and positrons in one of corresponding asymptotic regions , @xmath108 and @xmath435 , occupy quasistationary states ; i.e. , they are described by wave packets that maintain their form on a sufficiently large distance in one of the corresponding asymptotic regions .",
    "such wave packets are superpositions of the corresponding plane waves from some subrange of energies @xmath436 . in the semiclassical approximation , we assume that the energy of a particle @xmath437 is an average value of these energies @xmath436 . then the total energy of a pair created with given @xmath438 , @xmath427 is a sum @xmath439 , where @xmath440 , i.e. , this energy is equal to the total field work @xmath441 .",
    "we note that this field work was partially used for the pair creation and partially for their further acceleration , such that before leaving the region @xmath442 they have gained the following average longitudinal momenta@xmath443 ^{2}-\\pi _ { \\bot } ^{2}}.\\]]at the same time the corresponding part ofenergy was lost for the field restricted in the region @xmath442 .",
    "let us estimate this energy considering wave packets @xmath444 and @xmath445 , which consist of partial waves of an @xmath446-electron @xmath447 and an @xmath448-positron @xmath449 , and which have focal planes @xmath450 somewhere in @xmath108 and @xmath451 , respectively .",
    "one can construct such wave packets using a procedure described in appendix d of ref .",
    "the energy flux of the field @xmath452 through a surface @xmath453 is defined as @xmath454then through any plane @xmath455 a positron carries away the energy @xmath456 for the time @xmath5 , whereas through any plane @xmath457 an electron carries away the energy @xmath458 for the time @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the field work spent for a pair acceleration is @xmath459 .",
    "consequently , the work spent for the creation of a pair in a given state is    @xmath460 /2 ,   \\label{l36}\\ ] ]    where @xmath416 is the work spent for the creation of a particle from a pair , @xmath215 is given by eq .",
    "( [ l5 ] ) , and @xmath461 are given by eq .",
    "( [ l35 ] ) .",
    "then the distribution ( [ l22 ] ) can be rewritten in the following form @xmath462the energy of a particle in the hawking formula ( [ ec1 ] ) can be treated as the work , @xmath416 , that a gravitational field has spent for the creation of a particle .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ l37 ] ) is , in fact , the boltzmann distribution with the temperature @xmath463 having literally the hawking form .",
    "thus , once again we see that the distributions of particles created by electromagnetic and gravitational fields have similar thermal structures .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the equivalence principle that the effective temperature @xmath464 of distribution ( [ l37 ] ) has literally the hawking form .",
    "regarding the distinction between the planck and the boltzmann distributions , we believe that the planck distribution for the hawking case necessarily arises due to the appearance of an event horizon ( there is a boundary of the domain of the hamiltonian ) ; that is , it is due to the condition for which the space domains of particle and antiparticle vacua are not the same .",
    "in contrast to this , in an electric field , we deal with both the particle vacuum and the antiparticle vacuum defined over the entire space , see ref .",
    "@xcite ; that is why these space domains coincide .",
    "in this conclusion we would like to try to characterize the place of the present article among the numerous works devoted to the effect of pair creation from a vacuum by an external electromagnetic field .",
    "first , we recall that in the area under discussion the possibility of obtaining any nonperturbative result is , as a rule , based on the existence of special exact solutions of the dirac equation with external electromagnetic fields that are able to create pairs from the vacuum .",
    "however , it is well known that there exist few such field configurations and corresponding exact solutions .",
    "we believe that , among these , the @xmath5-constant and the @xmath0-constant electric fields with sufficiently large parameters @xmath5  and @xmath0have _ a priority _ , because studying the effect in such relatively simple field configurations allows one to understand typical physical characteristics of the effect in wide classes of external fields .",
    "the study of a pair creation effect  in the @xmath5-constant electric fields already has a long story , which we  cited in the introduction . here",
    "almost all local and global characteristics of the effect were calculated in detail using the well - developed formulation of qed with @xmath2-electric potential steps . a similar study for @xmath0-constant electric fields  did not exist until the present , as a formulation of qed with @xmath4-electric potential steps , which is sufficient for this problem ,",
    "was developed by us a short time ago in ref .",
    "our present article , then , contains for the first time a consistent qed treatment of the pair creation effect in the @xmath0-constant electric field , a treatment that is free from misunderstandings of a naive one - particle consideration .",
    "moreover , the presented sets of stationary solutions as well as their interpretation , probabilities , vacuum mean values , and analysis of length and time scales , constitute a possible basis for future research in strong - field qft of small - gradient fields .

    "15 - 12 - 10009 .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly present some basic constructions of qed with an @xmath0-constant electric field that follow from the general formulation of qed with @xmath4-electric potential step @xcite and the results of sect . [ s2 ] .",
