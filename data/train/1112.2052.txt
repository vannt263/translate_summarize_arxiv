    "recently nanoshells@xcite have received a lot of attention because they possess interesting optical properties . consisting of a dielectric core surrounded by a metallic shell ,",
    "nanoshells allow surface plasmon polaritons to exist at the interfaces between the layers , resulting in a spectrum with very pronounced absorption and extinction peaks .",
    "the position and broadness of these resonance peaks depend on the size , shape and materials of the particles and on the surrounding medium .",
    "this versatility and sensitivity make nanoshells excellent probes in different fields , ranging from cancer ablation@xcite and biosensors@xcite to surface enhanced raman spectroscopy applications@xcite and plasmonics@xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the usefulness of nanoshells in the field of high - pressure physics , and more precisely diamond anvil cell ( dac ) pressure measurements@xcite .",
    "the first theoretical calculations for a spherically symmetric sio@xmath0-gold nanoshell under pressure ( up to 200 gpa ) are presented , indicating clear measurable absorption peaks .",
    "the main idea behind the use of nanoshells as a pressure gauge is that the size of the nanoshell and the permittivity of the sio@xmath0 core and medium will change under pressure resulting in a shift of the resonance frequencies .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate the optical transmission as a function of wavelength for a spatial distribution of noninteracting monodisperse nanoshells .    at the moment",
    "there are several pressure gauges used in high - pressure physics .",
    "we briefly discuss them and conclude with the advantages of the nanoshell - gauge in comparison with the established methods .",
    "the prime and venerable pressure gauge is the shift of the peak of the ruby fluorescence spectrum with pressure@xcite , excited by laser pumping . in this case micron",
    "sized ruby grains are embedded in the pressurization medium .",
    "several problems can arise above a certain pressure@xcite : at pressures above 100 gpa diamond fluorescence can become intense and mask the ruby line ; ruby grains can be blown away during loading or masked during pressurization ; above a few hundred gpa the standard method of pumping the ruby with a green or blue laser line becomes ineffectual as the laser light is absorbed by the diamond anvil .",
    "although some of these problems can be overcome@xcite , ruby becomes challenging to use at very high pressure . for cases where",
    "the ruby is lost or can not be observed researchers have used the phonon raman spectrum of the diamond from the high pressure culet or stressed region of the diamond .",
    "this is less precise and has some dependence on the diamond geometry@xcite .",
    "another method is to embed a grain of diamond in the pressurization medium , but this also has challenges and limitations@xcite . an important gauge is the x - ray spectrum of metal markers  embedded in the pressurization medium , but this is only useful at synchrotrons .",
    "finally we mention that many of the pressure gauges have problems at high temperatures .",
    "the advantages of the nanoshells , which come dispersed in a volatile fluid , is that they can be painted onto the diamond culet in a thin invisible ( to the eye ) layer so they will not blow out and they cover the entire culet flat so they can not easily be masked ; they should maintain their sensitivity to the highest pressures ; optical spectroscopy is easy to implement with a large signal - to - noise ratio , compared to fluorescence or raman scattering , and will not be masked by fluorescence from the diamonds .",
    "we believe that nanoshells will maintain their sensitivity at high temperatures , but this requires further study .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we first review existing theories that can be used to calculate the spectrum and resonance frequencies of a nanoshell .",
    "next , the pressure dependency is taken into account . in section",
    "iii the results of the calculations are shown for the nanoshell geometry .",
    "to overcome some of the problems seen with nanoshells the coated nanoshell is introduced in section iv .",
    "section v contains the conclusions .",
    "the optical properties of nanoshells are usually described by either mie theory or the hybridization model .",
    "the hybridization model , developed by nordlander and co - workers@xcite , offers a fast - to - evaluate analytical form for the resonance frequencies , but it is only valid for small particles ( smaller than ca .  a tenth of the wavelength ) .",
    "mie theory@xcite is valid for all particle sizes but this method is far more time consuming for calculating the peak positions since it does not allow for a closed form analytical formula for the position of the resonance peak .",
    "these resonance peak positions have to be numerically derived from the absorption or extinction spectrum .    in this section first both theories will be reviewed .",
    "the pressure dependency is taken into account in the last part of this section .",
    "hybridization theory@xcite is a phenomenological approach in which the nanoshell is modeled as a combination of a cavity and a metallic sphere .",
    "first the sphere and cavity are studied separately .",
    "the free electrons of the sphere are descibed as an incompressible fluid excited by plasmons and the dielectric function is assumed to be that of a drude metal@xcite:@xmath1 where @xmath2 indicates the background permittivity and @xmath3 the bulk plasma frequency of the metal .    in a second step",
    "the resonance frequencies of the cavity and the sphere are hybridized due to the coupling between the cavity and the sphere modes , very similar to the hybridization of molecular orbitals .",

    "the results originally derived by mie for a single spherical interface were worked out by aden and kerker@xcite .",
    "the coated nanoshell , which will be introduced later , is modeled by three concentric spheres .",
    "extending mie theory to three concentric spheres , although not available in literature , does not provide any new problems in comparison with the two concentric sphere case solved by aden and kerker .",
    "the final expressions for the electromagnetic fields in and around the coated nanoshell , as well as the scattering and absorption cross section , are given in the appendix . from the resulting total cross section",

    "the pressure dependency of the radii is shown in figure [ fig ns under pressure ] for a nanoshell with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . when the nanoshell is compressed the electron density will increase and so will the bulk plasma frequency ( [ wbp ] ) .",
    "this will also influence the permittivity of the metal since the plasma frequency is an essential part of the drude dielectric function ( see eq .",
    "@xmath38 ) .",
    "the pressure and frequency dependency of the permittivity of sio@xmath0 in the megabar regime remains , to the best of our knowledge , unknown .",
    "however it is possible to estimate the pressure dependency from the vinet eos using the clausius - mossotti relation@xcite:@xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electron density and @xmath41 the average atomic polarizability , assumed independent of pressure .",
    "this relation links the permittivity to the volume of a material .",
    "dividing this equation with the same equation at zero pressure allows us to estimate@xmath42 where @xmath43 can be calculated from the vinet eos @xmath44 and @xmath45 represents the relative permittivity at zero pressure .",
    "the pressure dependency of the permittivity of sio@xmath0 and some other possible medium materials is shown in figure [ fig permittivity ] .",
    "figure2.eps    notice that there is no phase change in the sio@xmath0 curve . in nature",
    "sio@xmath0 is in a crystalline phase at zero pressure and will switch to the amorphous phase at about @xmath46 gpa .",
    "however , it has been reported@xcite that the fabrication method of the sio@xmath0 particles results in cores which are in the amorphous state also at zero pressure .",
    "figure3.eps    figure [ fig rel cross section ] shows the relative cross section of the considered nanoshell placed in vacuum as calculated with mie theory .",
    "the relative cross section is the total optical cross section divided by @xmath47 , the area of the projection of the nanoshell on a plane perpendicular to the incoming radiation . from this figure",
    "one can clearly see a substantial blueshift when @xmath48 gpa pressure is applied .",
    "another important observation concerns the width of the peak .",
    "this is important for increasing the precision in an experimental measurement since sharper peaks allow for a more accurate determination of the peak position .",
    "however , sharp resonance lines may elude experimental detection if they do not carry enough spectral weight . in figure [ fig rel cross section ] one can see that the dipole peak ( the rightmost peak ) is a broad , clear and rather symmetric peak , while the quadrupole peak is much sharper and a good candidate for these kind of experiments .",
    "numerically however it is easier to track the broad dipole peak , thus all results presented here will be with regard to the dipole peak .",
    "it is seen that although the quantitative results differ for all peaks , the qualitative results presented here hold true for all resonance peaks .",
    "figure4.eps    in figure [ fig peak position vac ] the position of the dipole resonance peak is shown as a function of pressure for a nanoshell in a medium with @xmath49 constant .",
    "the black squares are calculated using mie theory and a subsequent numerical determination of the peak maximum .",
    "the results from the hybridization theory are presented by the red circles .",
    "it is clear that the two theories do not agree on the exact position of the resonance peak for the considered nanoshell .",
    "this is due to the electrostatic limit used in the hybridization model which is only acceptable for nanoparticles much smaller than the wavelengths of the incident light ( the limiting case for nanoshells much smaller than the wavelengths used in a dac experiment , with sizes at the moment unachievable for fabrication , do agree ) .",
    "still the hybridization model can prove to be useful because both theories agree well on the amount the peak shifts , as is shown in the inset of figure [ fig peak position vac ] .",
    "the two theories diverge from each other only at higher pressures .",
    "the results show that the nanoshell could be used to measure the pressure by determing the amount the resonance peak shifts .",
    "the inset is also an indication of the resolution that could be achieved .",
    "for this example nanoshell the dipole resonance peak shifts over @xmath50 when @xmath48 gpa pressure is applied ( for rubies this would be @xmath51@xcite ) .    to determine the usefulness of nanoshells as a pressure gauge",
    ", calibration would need to be done for every pressure medium separately .",
    "the nanoshell s optical response depends on the dielectric function of the surrounding medium in which it is placed , and as such both the position of the resonance peaks and their pressure - induced shift will differ for different pressure media .",
    "the original data used for the calculation of the dielectric function are shown in table [ table n medium ] . in figure [ fig peak position medium ]    figure5.eps    one can see the pressure dependency of the position of the dipole resonance peak for different pressure media : helium , hydrogen and neon .",
    "the behavior of the medium under pressure clearly has a large influence on the optical response of the nanoshell . for these media ,",
    "the blueshift that occurs in vacuum has turned into a redshift as pressure is increased . from a certain pressure on , there will be almost no shift of the resonance peak , rendering the nanoshells ineffectual as pressure gauges in that region .",
    "although it is possible to calculate the optical response of nanoshells for much higher pressures , the results are not presented here because they are based on extrapolation of data from a limited pressure region and as such are considered unreliable .",

    "as was seen in the previous section , the simple nanoshell geometry is not ideal for high - pressure experiments .",
    "the peak shift is affected by the pressure medium so calibration will be necessary for each nanoshell and medium .",
    "a possible solution would be to shield the nanoparticle from the effects of the medium , therefore allowing the shift of the resonance peak to be influenced only by the compression of the nanoparticle .",
    "the absence of these problems when the nanoshell is placed in vacuum indicates that shielding the particle could indeed result in the desired effect .    shielding the nanoparticle from the environments means creating a barrier between the golden shell and the dielectric medium .",
    "this barrier should also be a dielectric .",
    "if not , another set of surface plasmons polaritons would arise on the interface between the outer layer and the environment , counteracting the intent of the extra layer . in this article the extra coating",
    "is achieved by adding an extra sio@xmath0 layer to the model and extending mie theory to three concentric spheres .",
    "henceforth we shall indicate this type of `` nanomatryushka''@xcite as `` coated nanoshell '' .",
    "the main question to be answered is how thick this coating should be to effectively shield the nanoshell from the pressure effects on the dielectric function of the environment .",
    "figure6.eps    figure [ fig peak pos cns ]  presents the dipole peak position for several coating thicknesses of the coated nanoshell as calculated by mie theory . for reasons of comparison the core and the thickness of the golden shell",
    "are kept the same as for the nanoshell discussed before .",
    "furthermore we have only studied the coated nanoshell in a helium environment since this is a commonly used quasi - hydrostatic pressure medium in dac experiments . in neon",
    "the results will be almost the same because the dielectric functions of helium and neon are similar . for hydrogen",
    "the counteracting effect is not present , therefore the results with nanoshells are adequate and no further improvements are necessary",
    ".    in this article we do not compare the calculations for the coated nanoshell with calculations using the hybridization model .",
    "the expansion of the hybridization theory for multiple layered nanoshells is available in literature@xcite , but it is not considered here due to the expected deviations since the diameters of the coated nanoshell particles are @xmath62 or @xmath63 times larger than the nanoshell particles and thus the electrostatic approximation is certainly not valid .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig peak pos cns ] that for thin coatings the redshift due to the effect of the medium is still visible . at a certain pressure",
    "the peak position will reach a maximum and from there on the peak will undergo a blueshift which is due to the compression of the nanoshell similar to the results in vacuum ( figure [ fig peak position vac ] ) .",
    "this maximum is indicated by the black crosses and can be used as a measure for the pressure up to which the medium affects the optical response of the nanoparticle .",
    "it is clear that for thicker coatings the maximum shifts to lower pressures suggesting that the influence of the medium indeed diminishes and thus that the coating effectively shields the nanoparticle .",
    "unfortunately the redshift never disappears completely meaning that the influence of the medium can not be fully shielded by the dielectric layer .",
    "however , it is possible to position the maximum into a pressure region where it can do no harm for the pressure measurements .    obviously , the thickness of the coating has to be adjusted to the needs of the experiments",
    ". a thicker coating will provide better shielding , but bigger particles take up more space and risk interacting with each other due to being in close proximity of one another .",
    "however , since the coated nanoshell is much larger than the nanoshell , the absolute cross section is larger , meaning that a smaller density is sufficient while still gaining the same response .",
    "the derivative of the curves on figure [ fig peak pos cns ] give a direct indication of the sensitivity achievable with the coated nanoshell structures . on average",
    "the sensitivity for the coated nanoshell with a @xmath64 thick coating ( upper curve on figure [ fig peak pos cns ] ) is approximately @xmath65 @xmath66gpa .",
    "the resolution for rubies in the same pressure regime ( @xmath67 to @xmath68 gpa ) is approximately @xmath69 @xmath66gpa@xcite and for a nanoshell in vacuum as was shown in figure [ fig peak position vac ] this would be @xmath70 @xmath66gpa . from this",
    "we can conclude that the theory predicts a better resolution for nanoshells than for rubies in the pressure regime under consideration .",
    "in this article we have carried out a theoretical analysis of nanoshells which can be designed so that they have absorption peaks in the ir - visible part of the optical spectrum due to scattering or absorption by localized surface plasmon polaritons .",
    "calculations indicate that for nanoshells in vacuum these peaks have a substantial shift with pressure making them suitable as a pressure gauge for high - pressure research .",
    "a useful pressure gauge should have a calibration ( peak wavelength vs pressure ) independent of the pressurization medium .",
    "we found that for a simple nanoshell consisting of an sio@xmath0 core and a gold shell , the calibration differed with the pressurization medium ; moreover it was double - valued and had a region of zero slope .",
    "the latter problem was resolved by coating the nanoshell with an sio@xmath0 cladding , resulting in a robust sensitive pressure gauge .",
    "the proposed nanoshell gauge has advantages in comparison with well - established pressure gauges : they will not easily blow out during loading of a dac , they can not easily be masked by fluorescence from the diamonds , they have large signal - to - noise ratio in comparison to fluorescence and raman scattering , and due to their small dimensions they will not be stressed by bridging between the diamonds at very high pressure when the gasket thins .",
    "all of these putative advantages must be confirmed by experiment .",
    "a possible implementation of the coated nanoshell would be to distribute them inside the dac cell together with the ruby on the diamond culet . for low pressures",
    "both gauges can be used and the coated nanoshell can be calibrated by using the extensive knowledge of the behavior of ruby under pressure@xcite .",
    "a possible challenge is the application of nanoshells to the surface of a diamond culet .",
    "coated nanoshells can be acquired at high concentration @xmath71 from nanospectra biosciences , inc .",
    ", in a liquid solution .",
    "a droplet can be placed on the culet and allowed to evaporate to produce a coverage bonded to the surface by van der waals forces .",
    "preliminary measurements show that to avoid clustering and segregation , it may prove useful to functionalize the diamond surface with a film of poly-4-vinylpyridine ( pvp ) which has dense sites that localize the nanoparticles@xcite .  for high pressures the ruby measurement would be difficult or no longer be possible .",
    "the spectra of the coated nanoshells however will still be measurable since these measurements are based on absorption and transmission . in this way nanoshells",
    "could be easily used and effectively extend pressure measurements to ultra high pressures .",
    "we thank nomie bardin for aiding with prelimary measurements of distributing coated nanoshells on diamond culets .",

    "the coated nanoshell was modeled using mie theory for 3 concentric spheres .",
    "these spheres divide the space into 4 regions : the core of the nanoparticle , two shells and the medium in which the nanoparticle is immersed , respectively numbered @xmath72 through @xmath73 as shown in figure [ fig schema 3 concentric spheres ] .",
    "the radii of the three spheres are indicated with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , from inner to outer . using the notations of bohren and huffman@xcite",
