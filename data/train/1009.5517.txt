    "the tensor renormalization - group ( trg ) method developed by levin and nave  @xcite is a highly useful update of the traditional position - space renormalization - group approaches .",
    "while these founding approaches relied on uncontrolled approximations that were often system - specific  @xcite , the trg is general in scope ",
    "it works on any classical two - dimensional lattice hamiltonian with local interactions  and its accuracy can be systematically improved to converge on the exact thermodynamic results . along with these advantages ,",
    "the method fits within the conceptual framework of traditional renormalization - group theory : it is a mapping between hamiltonians on the original and coarse - grained lattices , and phase transition behavior can be extracted from flows of the hamiltonians as the transformation is iterated  @xcite .",
    "the initial trg study demonstrated the power of the approach in the context of the triangular - lattice ising model  @xcite . since then it has proven a versatile tool for a variety of classical systems , including the frustrated ising model on a shastry - sutherland lattice  @xcite , relevant to magnetization plateaus in rare - earth tetraborides , and the zero - hopping limit of a model for ultra - cold bosonic polar molecules on a hexagonal optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ideas behind the trg method have become the kernel for developments in two - dimensional quantum systems  @xcite , most notably tensor - entanglement renormalization group for studying symmetry breaking and topological phase transitions  @xcite , and accurate methods to calculate ground - state expectation values  @xcite . beyond the precision of the method ,",
    "a key factor spurring the growth of tensor rg applications in both classical and quantum cases is computational efficiency : the cpu cost of carrying out trg scales linearly with lattice size  @xcite",
    ".    given these promising characteristics , trg is a natural candidate for tackling models with quenched randomness  a field where extracting accurate phase diagram information is a significant challenge .",
    "the current study presents the first example of trg applied to such a system with frozen disorder , namely the percolative system of the bond - diluted triangular - lattice ising ferromagnet , yielding , as seen in fig.1 , a highly accurate global phase diagram , down to zero temperature , where it connects with the percolation transition .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ method ] develops the trg method for a general quenched random system .",
    "[ ising ] illustrates this tensor network mapping in particular for the bond - diluted model and shows how to extract physical observables such as spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "[ results ] uses this method , together with finite - size scaling relations for the correlation functions , to derive our main result : the phase diagram in terms of temperature vs. bond dilution probability .",
    "close agreement with the known critical temperature curve  @xcite is achieved even at a relatively low order of the trg approximation ( i.e. , a small cutoff parameter ) .",
    "our work opens up future possibilities for the extensive use of trg in quenched disordered systems , as argued in the concluding remarks of sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "as in earlier studies  @xcite , we focus here on classical hamiltonians associated with hexagonal - lattice tensor networks , though the method that we develop for quenched random systems is readily generalized to other geometries like the square and kagom lattices  @xcite .",
    "we consider a general hamiltonian that involves local interactions expressed in terms of bond degrees of freedom , such that each bond has @xmath2 possible states and the partition function of the system has the form @xmath3 where , for each of the @xmath4 sites in the hexagonal lattice , a real - valued tensor @xmath5 is a boltzmann weight depending on the configuration of the three bonds meeting at the site .",
    "the bond degrees of freedom correspond to each tensor index running from 1 to @xmath2 .",
    "these bond indices are labeled @xmath6 through @xmath7 , for the total of @xmath8 bonds in the lattice .",
    "although the tensor can have as many as @xmath9 distinct non - zero elements , in practice some bond configurations may be disallowed for a given hamiltonian , corresponding to zero - valued tensor elements .",
    "construction of the hexagonal lattice used in the trg procedure .",
    "starting from the initial structure on the left ( @xmath10 ) , at each construction step , every vertex is replaced by a hexagon .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed between the top and bottom edges and between the left and right edges , as if the lattice is on the surface of a torus .",
    "the sublattices @xmath11 and @xmath12 are shown for the @xmath10 step . ]        to facilitate the description of the trg procedure , the hexagonal lattice is constructed as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : at the @xmath13th step , we replace each vertex with a hexagon , with the initial structure denoted @xmath10 .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions , such that the top and bottom edges are equivalent , as well as the left and right edges , so that the lattice effectively lies on the surface of a torus .",
    "after the @xmath13th step , the system has @xmath14 sites and @xmath15 bonds .",
    "the trg method involves a renormalization - group transformation that reverses this construction process , mapping the system at step @xmath13 to one at step @xmath16 .",
    "the hexagonal lattice of any size can be decomposed into two sublattices @xmath11 and @xmath12 , such that the nearest neighbors of one type belong to the other type . as an example",
    ", we label the sublattices in the @xmath10 panel of fig .",
    "we distinguish the sublattice tensors with superscripts , @xmath17 or @xmath18 . in the partition function sum of eq .",
    ", each bond index @xmath19 appears twice , once within an @xmath11 tensor , and once within the neighboring @xmath12 tensor linked through that bond . thus evaluating @xmath20 consists of performing @xmath21 tensor contractions .",
    "in addition to the bond variables , the general system we consider has quenched random degrees of freedom , though for notational simplicity we shall not explicitly show the dependence of @xmath22 on these .",
    "physical observables @xmath23 will be expressed as @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 denotes the thermodynamic average over the bond degrees of freedom and @xmath26 $ ] denotes the configurational average over the quenched disorder .",
    "the trg transformation consists of two steps , known as rewiring and decimation . in the rewiring step ,",
    "the bonds of every pair of neighboring tensors @xmath27 and @xmath28 are reconnected , rewriting them as a contraction of two new tensors @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the reconnection pattern is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a , b ) and can be broken down into three basic cases ( highlighted in different colors ) involving different orientations of the intial @xmath27 and @xmath28 tensors . in our graphical convention ,",
    "the vertex where three solid lines meet is a @xmath22 tensor and the vertex where three dashed lines meet is an @xmath31 tensor .",
    "indices on a tensor , i.e. , @xmath32 , correspond to bonds labeled @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 arranged counterclockwise around the tensor , with the first index marking the vertical bond for the @xmath22 tensors and the horizontal bond for the @xmath31 tensors .",

    "[ fig2](b ) denote the mathematical identities @xmath36 note that the @xmath31 tensors have two indices which run up to @xmath2 ( labeled by latin letters ) and one index that runs up to @xmath37 ( labeled by a greek letter ) .",
    "the reason why @xmath29 and @xmath30 must have this structure comes from the following derivation , which also illustrates how one can explicitly calculate these tensors .",
    "we shall describe the derivation for case 1 , since the other two cases are analogous .",
    "the first line of eq .   can be expressed as a @xmath38 matrix equation , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "here we use composite indices @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath37 states defined as @xmath45 and @xmath46 . as a real - valued matrix",
    ", @xmath47 has a singular value decomposition of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 are orthogonal matrices and @xmath51 is a diagonal matrix containing the @xmath37 singular values of @xmath47 .",
    "once the singular value decomposition of @xmath47 is calculated , the elements of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by @xmath52 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the @xmath55th singular value , adopting the ordering convention from largest to smallest with increasing @xmath55 .    after all @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 pairs are rewired , we have a so - called martini lattice of @xmath29 and @xmath30 tensors , shown in fig .  [ fig2](c ) .",
    "the final step of the trg transformation is decimation , which traces over the degrees of freedom in the triangles of the martini lattice , substituting for each triangle a renormalized tensor @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "graphically , fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) shows the decimation of three @xmath29 tensors to form @xmath56 and of three @xmath30 tensors to form @xmath58 .",

    ", is exactly preserved through this transformation , as the hexagonal lattice is coarse - grained from a step @xmath13 to a step @xmath16 structure .",
    "however , the indices of the renormalized tensors run from 1 to @xmath37 instead of 1 to @xmath2 , so that if the trg were iterated , arbitrarily large tensors would result , making numerical implementation difficult .",
    "this problem is related to a general feature of position - space renormalization on lattices : except for specially tailored geometries ( i.e. , hierarchical lattices  @xcite ) , the number of couplings in the renormalized hamiltonian grows with each coarse - graining . for the trg",
    ", we can tackle this issue in a systematic fashion by truncating the index range with an upper bound @xmath61 . in eq .   for @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ", we shall allow the indices @xmath55,@xmath62 , and @xmath63 to run only up to @xmath64 .",
