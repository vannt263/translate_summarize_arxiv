    "the nonlinear source of general relativity attract the significant attention because of the specific properties such as the black hole solutions with interesting asymptotic behaviors , existence of the soliton solutions , solving the initial singularity in the early universe and so on .",
    "the pioneering theory of the nonlinear electrodynamics was proposed , by born and infeld @xcite , with the aim of obtaining a finite value for the self - energy of a pointlike charge . in 1935 , hoffmann @xcite attempted to relate the nonlinear electrodynamics and gravity .",
    "he obtained a solution to the einstein equations for a pointlike born - infeld charge , which is devoid of the divergence of the metric at the origin that characterizes the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "after these great achievements , because of difficulties that appeared in mathematical formulation , there were not any appreciable attentions to the nonlinear electromagnetic fields . in other word ,",
    "the born - infeld theory was nearly forgotten for several decades , until the interest in nonlinear electrodynamics increased in the context of low energy string theory @xcite .",
    "the exact solutions of born - infeld theory coupled to gravity with or without a cosmological constant have been considered by many authors @xcite .",
    "the rotating solutions of born - infeld gravity with various horizons and investigation of their properties have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been aroused interest about black hole solutions whose source is maxwell invariant raised to the power @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath1 as the source of geometry in einstein and higher derivative gravity @xcite .",
    "this theory is considerably richer than that of the linear electromagnetic field and in the special case ( @xmath2 ) it can reduce to linear field . also , it is valuable to find and analyze the effects of exponent @xmath0 on the behavior of the new solutions and the laws of black hole mechanics @xcite .",
    "in addition , in higher dimensional gravity , for the special choice @xmath3 , where @xmath4dimension of the spacetime is a multiple of @xmath5 , it yields a traceless maxwell s energy - momentum tensor which leads to conformal invariance . the idea is to take advantage of the conformal symmetry to construct the analogues of the four dimensional reissner - nordstrm solutions , in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "being motivated by the gravity originated from the nonlinear electromagnetic fields , in this paper we investigate the existence of black string solutions with two types of nonlinear electromagnetic fields , called born - infeld theory ( bi ) and a power of maxwell invariant ( pmi ) , separately and study their properties . in general ,",
    "the black string solutions of einstein gravity have been extensively analyzed in the many literatures .",
    "for e.g. , charge black string solutions have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nonuniform black strings have been considered in @xcite , thermodynamics and stability of black strings have been investigated in @xcite and also the properties of the non - abelian and nontrivial topology black string have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows : we give a brief review of the field equations of einstein gravity sourced by the nonlinear electromagnetic fields , present charged rotating black string solutions and investigate their properties , especially asymptotic behavior of them .",
    "then , we obtain conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the black string in which satisfy the first law of thermodynamics . we finish our paper with some conclusions .",
