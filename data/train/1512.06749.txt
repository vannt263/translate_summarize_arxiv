    "phase only spatial light modulator ( slm ) finds numerous applications including optical tweezers @xcite , microscopy @xcite , or manipulation of atoms @xcite .",
    "typically in addition to voltage - controlled phase delay the diffracted beam is subject to wavefront distortion due to slm curvature , wavefront error of the illuminating beam and possibly the optics between the slm and final plane of application .",
    "the slm curvature can be calibrated using surface metrology interferometers @xcite .",
    "it is more useful however to calibrate the wavefront at the output of the entire setup .",
    "this is possible using for example shack - hartmann method @xcite which measures phase profile gradient or using iterative gerchberg - saxon algorithm @xcite which is unfortunately sensitive to starting data and requires rather high dynamic range .",
    "recently methods which aim directly at achieving perfect focusing have been developed @xcite .",
    "they rely on activating two regions on the slm and observing the interference between two light bundles produced this way .",
    "this can be done on a camera @xcite or even using fluorescent - particle @xcite .",
    "the entire wavefront can be reconstructed by scanning one of the regions across the whole slm .    here",
    "we propose an alternative method for reconstructing wavefront in a particular optical setup involving slm .",
    "to achieve higher throughput and noise immunity we use several regions on the slm simultaneously and analyze resulting interference images by fourier transform to extract phase differences . by displaying a number of small phase gratings",
    "we diffract parallel beams which focus and interfere together on a far field camera .",
    "in addition we correct for nonuniform illumination of the slm by registering the near field image of diffracted beam .",
    "our method works with any setup sufficient for registering both near and far field images of diffracted beams .",
    "the implementation presented here bases entirely on singlet lenses and enables diagnosing global wavefront properties with any controlled - exposure digital camera placed in the far field .",

    "light reflected and diffracted from the slm is refocused by @xmath0 lens but only first order diffraction is passed through an iris .",
    "lenses @xmath1 and @xmath2 rely far field from iris plane to the fourier plane camera , while @xmath0 and @xmath1 create slm image on image plane camera ( resolution 1392 @xmath7 1040 , pixel size 6.45 @xmath8 m , bassler sca1400 - 17fm ) .",
    "the half wave plate enables adjusting the splitting ratio between diagnostic part and further experiment part .",
    "diffraction of beam with arbitrary amplitude and phase is possible by displaying depth - modulated phase diffraction grating @xmath9 on the slm .",
    "the grating is composed of tiles with depth @xmath10 and spatial period @xmath11 and can be described by a formula : @xmath12 let the grating be illuminated with a plane wave of amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "then the electric field corresponding to the first order diffraction off the grating on slm plane is : @xmath14    by adjusting the grating depth @xmath10 and shifting it laterally the amplitude and phase of the diffracted beam can be changed at will . by composing many short fragments of varying depths next to one another , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ im : phase_mask ] beam with arbitrary amplitude distribution can be diffracted @xcite .",

    "the crucial observation is contributions to the interference pattern @xmath38 coming from each pair of beams can be separated by fourier transforming the @xmath38 thus revealing the phase differences @xmath39 .",

    "for this reason to make phase distortion map @xmath49 we perform a series of measurements .",
    "we diffract @xmath50 beams , which is good tradeoff between complexity and precision .",

    "the entire measurement consists in acquiring 700 images and takes about 5 minutes which is limited predominantly by delays in simple labview software while changing phase masks on the slm and acquisition from the camera .    , created by averaging results of 5-point measurements from 500 images and 4-point measurements from 200 images .",
    "this is a combined effect of the slm , illuminating beam wavefront distortion and focusing optics . ]",
    "note the scheme of calibration described above compensates for the wavefront distortions of the optics between the slm and a certain calibration plane which is imaged on one camera and fourier transformed to the other camera . for proper operation of the scheme the optical setup has to fulfil the following conditions .",
    "the slm has to be imaged with little blur , of the order of several periods of phase grating @xmath11 so that the desired final spatial amplitude variations at relied with sufficient fidelity .",
    "the far field camera has to register true fourier transform of the calibration plane field .",
    "the fidelity has to be high at small angles corresponding to angular spread of probing gaussian beams and the resolution good enough to resolve fringes due to their interference .    in our setup ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ im : schemat ] ) the calibration plane is located at the slm image camera that is 79 mm behind the center of the pbs and the image there is magnified by a factor of @xmath53 . due to particular lens arrangement",
    "the wavefront there is diverging with @xmath54  mm radius of curvature when the entire beam is focused in the fourier plane .",
    "thus to produce certain wavefront @xmath55 at physical location of our image plane one has to program spatial phase @xmath56 with @xmath57  mm due to magnification with respect to image plane .     as a function of phase grating depth @xmath58 normalized to unity . ]",

    "we find focal plane beam diameter of 28.5  @xmath8 m by fitting .",
    "a less trivial test consists in creating bessel beams and verifying their propagation properties .",
    "bessel beams are solutions of wave equation which are diffraction resistant @xcite .",
    "the family of bessel beams amplitude are expressed in cylindrical coordinates by : @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is n - order bessel function , @xmath79 is the beam radius , @xmath80 is frequency of light and @xmath81 is the speed of light .",

    "[ im : bessel7 + 8_prop ] . moreover eq . ( [ eq : k_ro_k_z ] ) rules",
    "that by setting different diameters @xmath79 of the component beams we can mismatch their phase velocities .",
    "this results in rotation of the crescent profile around beam axis along propagation . in fig .",
    "[ im : bessel7 + 8_prop ] we present measured intensity of beam superposition at three distances : 0 cm , 75 cm and 150 cm from the pbs .",
    "in addition to the tests described above we characterized the beam outgoing from our system with commercial haso 32 shack - hartmann wavefront sensor .",
    "we program our modulator to diffract uniform rectangular beam .",
    "we compared the wavefronts with and without an additional lens inserted right in front of the laser ( see fig .",
    "[ im : schemat ] ) which imprinted curvature onto the wavefront illuminating the slm . using shack - hartmann sensor we retrieved an extra wavefront curvature corresponding to r=5.5 @xmath83 0.1 m in the slm plane , with error due to uncertanities in relay lens positions . with our method we measured r= 5.3 m. the difference between those two amounts to @xmath84 wavefront difference at the rim of the slm .",
    "the rms deviation of raw measurements from paraboloid has random structure with rms @xmath85 in case of shack - hartmann sensor and rms @xmath86 in case of our method .    when the modulator is programmed to produce flat - wavefront beam in the image plane the shack - hartmann sensor measures @xmath84 rms deviation from flat wavefront over entire beam .",
    "to understand this result note that the path leading to the fourier plane camera used for calibration at the path leading to shack - hartmann sensor differ by extra reflection from pbs and biconvex singlet lens .",
    "thus we attribute this result to the quality of pbs stated as @xmath84 by the manufacturer and spherical aberration of the lens . for experiments requiring greater wavefront precision",
    "those two elements or their equivalents have to be of better quality .",
    "we performed proof - of - principle demonstration of a simple method to calibrate and compensate the total wavefront distortion and nonuniform illumination in an slm setup .",
    "the method relies on diffracting several gaussian beams off the slm and registering their interference pattern on a camera placed in the far field .",
    "we confirmed the accuracy of calibration by diffracting the bessel beams and a superposition of two bessel beams which is rotating during propagation as expected .",
    "additionally we verified our method and commercial haso 32 shack - hartmann wavefront sensor .",
    "we implemented our method using standard singlet lenses and optical components and a pair of digital cameras .",
    "the method relies on registering position of rather sparse interference fringes thus very basic cameras are sufficient",
    ". the setup could be even further simplified by performing amplitude calibration without the image plane camera .",
    "this would be accomplished by diffracting a single small beam off the slm , scanning its position across the surface and registering the intensity using the fourier plane camera .",
    "our method is well suited to compensating wavefront errors introduced by the optical elements used to rely the slm onto the final use plane as long as this final plane is faithfully fourier transformed onto far field camera .",
    "the algorithm presented directly probes phase differences between multiple points .",
    "any setup sufficient for registering both near and far field properties of diffracted beams is adequate for our method .",
