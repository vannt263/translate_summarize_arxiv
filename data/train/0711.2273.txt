    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide the ideal environment with which to study strongly interacting nuclear matter at different thermodynamic conditions .",
    "lattice qcd calculations predict that above a certain critical temperature , nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition forming a deconfined state of quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "various signatures of qgp formation have been proposed with the enhancement of strangeness production being one of the experimental observables  @xcite . despite the large amount of different signatures that were proposed , due to the complexity of the different processes that might be competing in the reaction ,",
    "a clear and unique signal of the qgp formation is not possible .",
    "thus , to understand and characterize the system formed in these heavy - ion collisions , it is necessary to perform a systematic study of the production of various particles including energy dependence and system size dependence as well as comparison to other reactions such as p+p , d+au and cu+cu .",
    "this kind of complete study is only possible now due to the large amount of data accumulated from several years of rhic - bnl operations and the new analysis from the lower energy cern - sps experiments .",
    "star  @xcite has a complex system of detectors specialized in measuring the maximum number of particles produced in a rhic collision on an event by event basis .",
    "in particular , the tracking detectors from star have a high efficiency for measuring charged particle tracks at mid - rapidity .",
    "the excellent track resolution and primary vertex position resolution yields a high efficiency for reconstructing strange particles through their secondary vertex and cascade decay topologies . in general , the invariant mass peaks of these particles can be extracted with good signal to noise ratios by applying only some basic geometrical and track quality cuts . energy loss ( de / dx ) information of the daughter tracks",
    "is also used to reduce combinatorial background .",
    "the background under the invariant mass peak can be subtracted by fitting the background shape or by simply counting the neighboring bins .",
    "transverse momentum spectra for these strange particles are obtained by calculating the invariant mass for each @xmath0 bin and correcting for inefficiency and acceptance on a point by point basis .",
    "the efficiency and acceptance corrections are calculated using simulated particles embedded into real events .",
    "the total yield ( dn / dy ) is obtained by using maxwell - boltzmann or exponential curves to extrapolate into the low and high @xmath0 region that is not covered by the measurement .",
    "systematic errors are estimated considering several factors in the different steps of the analysis such as the variation in the yield due to variations in the background subtraction techniques , variations due to differences in the topological geometric cuts and differences between real data and simulated data in the efficiency calculation .    here in this article",
    ", we present an analysis that concentrates on the production of strange particles , with special interest in the energy and system size dependence comparing the particle yields with predictions obtained from a statistical thermal model . data presented here",
    "are a compilation of star experiment data from the last seven years  @xcite and some additional data points in the lower energy range from experiments na49  @xcite and na57  @xcite obtained from the literature .",
    "the large amount of data measured for each reaction system also allows for the classification of events based on the centrality of the collision .",
    "collision centrality is determined by the measured charged particle multiplicities . for",
    "each centrality one can estimate the average number of particles that participate in the reaction @xmath1 using a glauber model calculation , that also provides the equivalent number of binary collisions @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ label1]a shows the yields of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as a function of @xmath1 for all the studied centralities in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath7 gev .",
    "a detailed discussion on @xmath8 and @xmath3 production in au+au and cu+cu collisions as a function of system size can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "most of the cu+cu data seem to be consistent with au+au yields when compared using the system volume ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the yields of @xmath3 hyperons for the most central cu+cu data seem to be slightly higher than the equivalent au+au data ( around @xmath9 ) . a possible explanation for this behavior could be found with a different scaling .",
    "a more detailed discussion was presented elsewhere at this conference  @xcite .    to evaluate the strangeness enhancement in heavy - ion collisions , au+au data is compared to p+p collisions normalized by @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ label1]b shows the normalized yields as a function of @xmath1 for all centralities in au+au and cu+cu collisions . a clear enhancement of hyperon production in au+au and cu+cu compared to p+p can be seen .",
    "anti - lambda and anti - xi yields are not shown in this comparison but similar curves are observed , with slightly lower enhancement levels , which is expected due to non - zero net baryon number .",
    "omega and anti - omega yields were added to reduce statistical error .",
    "it is interesting to note that this enhancement can be observed even in the most peripheral bins in au+au and cu+cu compared to the p+p yields .",
    "in addition , the enhancement appears to increase linearly as a function of @xmath1 and also with strange quark content .",
    "the strangeness enhancement hierarchy is in accordance to what is expected from canonical thermal production  @xcite , but the dependence with volume ( @xmath1 ) disagrees with this same picture of canonical thermal production .    figure  [ label1]c shows the strange particle yields normalized by the number of binary collisions @xmath2 and compared to p+p .",
    "once more , cu+cu data seems to be in agreement with the au+au data but with a smaller discrepancy for the @xmath3 yield in the most central cu+cu bin .",
    "this plot also shows that strange particle production does not scale with @xmath2 , suggesting that a different scaling is required .",
    "a statistical thermal model @xcite was used to fit the different particle ratios measured in au+au and cu+cu collisions at energies of 200 gev and 62.4 gev , for different centrality bins .",
    "yields of protons , pions kaons , @xmath3 s and @xmath10 s were used to calculate the yields for the fit .",
    "figure  [ label2 ] shows the results from these fits with chemical freeze - out temperature ( @xmath11 ) , baryon chemical potential ( @xmath12 ) and strangeness saturation parameter ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the temperature seems to show no dependence on the system size nor on the energy .",
    "the baryon chemical potential seems to be constant with sytem size for the 200 gev au+au data , but shows a small increase with centrality in the lower energy 62.4 gev au+au data .",
    "the strangeness saturation parameter , in the data from both energies , shows an increase with the system size till it reaches a saturation point .",
    "the new cu+cu data , was analyzed only for the most central bin , and the comparison in the last plot indicates that strangeness is already saturated for this system , which is not true in the equivalent @xmath1 data from au+au collisions .",
    "figure  [ label3]a shows the particle yields as a function of collision energy compiling data from experiments at ags - bnl  @xcite , sps - cern  @xcite and rhic - bnl  @xcite .",
    "baryon yields show a strong increase in the region of the ags collision energies up to around 10 gev , after which , the baryon yields stay relatively constant . above sps energies",
    ", there seems to be a smooth increase of the baryon production at higher energies .",
    "the anti - baryon yields increase continuously and smoothly with energy , that can be inferred from the ratio plots shown in figure  [ label3]b .",
    "these plots show the variation of the baryon production mode from a transport dominated regime into a pair - production regime .",
    "the new cu+cu data is included in the ratio plot with a star symbol for 62.4 gev and 200 gev , and show no difference to the au+au ratios . from these curves , it is straightforward to predict the expected yields of these particles at the lhc energies . for @xmath3",
    "the expected yield is between 10 and 30 , for @xmath10 it is between 3 and 6 , while for @xmath14 between 0.4 and 0.7 .",
    "2.5 in 2.5 in    figure  [ label4 ] shows an excitation function of the thermal fit parameters ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) for the data from the na49 experiment at the sps - cern and star - rhic data . at rhic energies ,",
    "the freeze - out temperatures seem to have achieved a saturation point around 170 mev .",
    "all fits were done using the thermus thermal code  @xcite , using particle ratios calculated from mid - rapidity yields ( dn / dy ) .",
    "once more , from these plots , it is possible to predict the conditions expected from the future lhc heavy - ion program , where @xmath12 should be close to zero and the temperature still around 170 mev .    2.5 in 2.5 in",
    "there are now considerable amounts of data from heavy - ion reactions that allow for a systematic study of the strange particle production for different energies and different reaction system sizes .",
    "this kind of study , and in particular that of strange particle production , is crucial to understand the characteristics of the strongly interacting matter formed in rhic collisions .",
    "the comparison between the new cu+cu data with the au+au data was shown and seems to be consistent with an @xmath15 scaling , except for the most central bin of the lambdas .",
    "thus it becomes clear that it is important to find the correct way to compare and scale the various different measurements from different reaction species and energies .",
    "the sharp change in behaviour of the particle yields excitation function in the lower energy region has been proposed as a signature for qgp formation  @xcite .",
    "this shows the importance of a high - statistics energy scan as proposed in the next rhic operation phase .",
    "also , the extrapolation of the various measured curves to the higher energy range shows the importance of the new measurements expected from lhc .",
    "we wish to thank fundao de amparo a pesquisa do estado de so paulo , and conselho nacional de pesquisa de desenvolvimento , brazil for the support to participate in the sqm2007 conference .",
