    "most galaxies are thought to host supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at their centers .",
    "the masses of these smbhs have been observed to correlate with several properties of their host elliptical galaxies and of the classical bulge components of their host disk galaxies .",
    "for example , correlates with galaxy / bulge mass @xcite , luminosity ( the @xmath6-@xmath8 relation ) @xcite , velocity dispersion ( the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation ) @xcite , and globular cluster content @xcite .",
    "these and other , similar correlations suggest that galaxy formation and black hole growth are fundamentally linked . to better understand this interplay ,",
    "accurate black hole masses are needed .",
    "one challenge that limits the accuracy is the determination of the host galaxy s inclination .",
    "projection effects are difficult to model and cause loss of information , leading to systematic uncertainties .",
    "therefore , smbhs in galaxies whose inclination is confidently known have the best chance of being accurately and robustly measured . another issue that limits the accuracy is the effect a dark matter halo has on the determination of smbh mass .",
    "@xcite show that orbit - based models can underestimate black hole mass when dark matter is not considered in the modeling , however @xcite find the effect is small when the black hole s sphere of influence is well - resolved .",
    "ngc  4594 ( m104 , or the sombrero galaxy ) is a nearly edge - on sa type spiral with a prominent stellar disk and large , classical bulge @xcite .",
    "the shape of this disk indicates that it ( and thus the entire galaxy ) is inclined at an angle very close to @xmath9 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a distance to ngc  4594 of 9.8 mpc , calculated from surface brightness fluctuations @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all distance - dependent quantities are scaled to this value .",
    "@xcite use a value of @xmath10 in their distance determinations , however we compare our and @xmath11 to @xcite who adopt @xmath12 in their work .",
    "we therefore scale the @xcite distances down by @xmath13 .",
    "black hole mass scales as @xmath14 and luminosity as @xmath15 ; these quantities are adjusted accordingly .",
    "ngc  4594 was one of the first galaxies in which a black hole was detected , and it has a long history of study .",
    "@xcite(1988 , hereafter ) first found evidence for a massive black hole of @xmath16 @xmath17 using only ground - based observations . with isotropic jeans models",
    ", @xcite measured a black hole of mass @xmath18 @xmath17 .",
    "later , @xcite ( 1996 , hereafter ) used high - resolution kinematics from the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst_)the same data set we include  to measure @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to a mass of @xmath20 . with isotropic models",
    ", @xcite obtained a value of @xmath21 @xmath17 .",
    "these values for all lie towards the high mass end of the @xmath6-@xmath7 and @xmath6-@xmath8 relations .",
    "massive smbh measurements are frequently being revised , and we expect the confidently known inclination of ngc  4594 to lead to one of the more secure measurements of a high mass smbh .",
    "we present new gemini spectroscopy of the major axis , as well as sauron integral field kinematics covering the central region of the galaxy .",
    "we also use high - resolution _",
    "kinematics of the nucleus and kinematics derived from globular clusters at large radii .",
    "we combine these kinematic datasets with _",
    "hst _ and ground - based photometry to run axisymmetric orbit - based models .",
    "these models allow us to measure the black hole mass , stellar mass - to - light ratio , and dark matter halo of ngc  4594 .",
    "in addition , we also recover information about the internal orbit structure of the galaxy .",
    "dynamical modeling requires as input the three - dimensional luminosity density distribution @xmath22 , as well as the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) at many locations in the galaxy .",
    "we use _ hst _ and ground - based images for the photometry . our kinematics include high - resolution _ hst_/fos spectra , long - slit spectra from gnirs on gemini , sauron integral field kinematics , and individual velocities of globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "we discuss each in turn .      in order to cover a large enough dynamical range to have leverage on both the central smbh and dark halo , we use surface brightness profiles from _ hst _ and ground - based images .",
    "the stellar disk of ngc  4594 dominates at intermediate radii on the major axis causing the isophotes in this region to be substantially flattened .",
    "this abrupt change in ellipticity introduces an additional challenge to the deprojection .",
    "our standard technique is to assume that the surfaces of constant luminosity density @xmath23 are coaxial , similar spheroids @xcite . clearly",
    "the presence of a disk invalidates this assumption , so we decompose the surface brightness into bulge and disk components , deprojecting each separately so that our assumption holds for each component .",
    "afterwards , we re - combine the deprojected profile of each component @xmath24 and input the total @xmath22 into our modeling program .",
    "the bulge - disk decomposition fits directly to a projected image .",
    "we construct a model disk by considering a @xcite profile :    @xmath25 \\label{diskeq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the surface brightness at @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the index .",
    "for @xmath29 , the profile is an exponential . for inclinations other than @xmath9 ,",
    "the projection of our disk model is an ellipse . by specifying the inclination of the disk @xmath30 ,",
    "the axial ratio @xmath31 of the ellipse is given by @xmath32 @xmath30 for a thin disk .",
    "we construct many disk models by varying @xmath26 , @xmath33 , @xmath30 , and @xmath28 ( keeping @xmath28 close to 1 ) .",
    "each model is then subtracted from the image until the residual brightness distribution has elliptical isophotes .",
    "the remaining light is assigned to the bulge component .",
    "a 1d major axis bulge profile is produced by averaging the bulge light in elliptical , annular isophotes .",
    "hence , we are left with an analytic disk model and a non - parametric bulge model .",
    "we identify the best bulge and disk models as those that minimize the rms residuals of the model - subtracted image .",

    "we fit the nuclear disk in the _ hst _ image and the main disk in the ground - based image . because we fit directly to the images , dust lanes and object masking become important .",
    "we keep a bad pixel list which instructs our code to ignore trouble spots .",
    "dust lanes are selected by eye , while sextractor @xcite is used to identify foreground stars , background galaxies , and globular clusters .",
    "to probe the nuclear region , we use a psf - deconvolved _ hst _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) image ( go-5512 ; pi : faber ) .",
    "this image is presented in and provides an excellent view of the central region of the galaxy .",
    "centered on the pc1 camera , the image is taken in the f547 m filter , and has a scale of 00455 pixel@xmath34 of the central @xmath35 of the galaxy .",
    "the psf deconvolution uses the lucy - richardson algorithm @xcite for 40 iterations and is well - tested on wfpc2 images @xcite .",
    "the best fit parameters from the bulge - disk decomposition are listed in table [ disktab ] .",
    "ngc  4594 is also thought to have weak liner emission @xcite and there is a point source in the _ hst _ image .",
    "furthermore , heavy dust absorption also makes the determination of the central bulge surface brightness profile difficult for @xmath36 . to deal with these issues ,",
    "we extrapolate the bulge surface brightness @xmath37 inwards to @xmath38 with a constant slope fit to the region near @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ allcomps ] shows the result of this extrapolation , as well as the other components fit in the ground - based image .",
    "we obtained a wide - field , @xmath40-band image from the prime focus camera on the mcdonald 0.8 m telescope .",
    "this instrument provides a large unvignetted field of view ( 45@xmath4145 arcmin@xmath42 ) and a single ccd detector .",
    "therefore , we can more robustly carry out sky - subtraction and accurately constrain the faint isophotes .",
    "the image is corrected for bias , flat field , and illumination using standard routines in iraf .    in our fit to the ground - based image , we ignore the central @xmath43 due to over - exposure and contamination from the nuclear disk .",
    "we attempt fits in the region @xmath44 with only one stellar disk given by equation ( [ diskeq ] ) , however these produce unacceptable residuals . instead of modifying equation ( [ diskeq ] ) , we add a second disk ( in addition to the nuclear disk fit only in the _ hst _ image ) .",
    "this approach is similar to the multi - gaussian expansion technique used to model the light distribution of bulges and ellipticals @xcite .",
    "a summary of all components fit is given in table [ disktab ] and plotted in figure [ allcomps ] .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are essentially bright test particles that allow us to probe the potential at radii where the stellar light is faint .",
    "they have been used in orbit - based models of other galaxies @xcite . to include them in our models",
    ", we use the gc number density profile @xcite as an analog to the stellar density .",
    "the number density profile is converted to a surface brightness profile by arbitrarily adjusting the zero point to match the stellar profile in log space .",
    "the green line in figure [ allcomps ] shows that the slope of the gc surface brightness profile is different from that of the stars .",
    "we run models using both the measured luminosity density distribution of the gcs and assuming that of the stars .",
    "we find significant preference for the measured gc profile .",
    "our bulge - disk decomposition returns a non - parametric form of the bulge profile .",
    "it is not necessary to have a parameterized bulge profile for our dynamical models , however we fit a profile to ground - based bulge model using equation ( [ diskeq ] ) .",
    "the bulge is well - fit by a function , with the rms residuals equal to @xmath45 .",
    "we measure @xmath46,@xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we can convert the central surface brightness @xmath26 and radius @xmath33 parameters to the more familiar `` effective '' parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the effective radius @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 and the effective surface brightness @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath53 depends on @xmath28 ; an expansion for @xmath53 can be found in @xcite . applying these conversions ,",
    "we obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we obtain a simpler estimate for the half - light radius of the bulge from integration of the surface brightness profile ; no fitting functions are required .",
    "we estimate @xmath56 .",
    "the integrated magnitudes are calculated for component @xmath57 by @xmath58 .",
    "this does not take into account the ellipticity of each component , so we scale the luminosity by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ellipticity of each component , assumed to be constant with radius .",
    "the bulge profile is known to become rapidly circular for @xmath61",
    "@xcite so our procedure almost certainly underestimates @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "these numbers are computed as a sanity check only , and do not affect the dynamical models .",
    "the absolute integrated magnitudes are @xmath64 and @xmath65 in f814w , corrected for galactic extinction along the line of sight @xcite . using the _ hst _ calibration package synphot (",
    "described in detail below ) , we convert these f814w magnitudes to @xmath66-band vega magnitudes .",
    "we obtain @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "these structural parameters lie exactly on the fundamental plane for bulges and ellipticals as presented in @xcite .",
    "our integrated magnitudes translate to a bulge - to - total ratio @xmath69 with the nuclear disk contributing @xmath70 of the total light .",
    "this value of @xmath63 is lower than previous measurements@xcite report @xmath71 .",
    "our @xmath63 , however , is in good agreement with a recent measurement by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* model bd ) .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath63 , our dynamical models are unaffected , because we add all the bulge and disk light together again after the deprojection .",
    "we do not explore the possibility of fitting an exponential stellar halo in addition to a bulge and disk as @xcite do .",
    "our bulge - disk decomposition produces a non - parametric bulge profile which could in principle be a combination of a bulge plus exponential halo .",
    "however , this resulting profile is well - fit by a function with @xmath28 significantly larger than 1 .",
    "we therefore do not agree with the claim made by @xcite that the bulge of ngc  4594 is actually an exponential stellar halo .",
    "we combine the _ hst _ and ground - based bulge profiles by zero - pointing both to f814w .",
    "we calculate the f547 m photometric zero point for the _ hst _ image from the synphot package in iraf .",
    "spectral template fitting ( section [ stelkin ] ) shows that in the central region of the galaxy @xmath72 of the light comes from k6iii stars .",
    "we therefore convert the f547 m zero point to f814w with synphot using the bruzual atlas template for a k6iii star .    before deprojection",
    ", we extrapolate the one - dimensional profiles @xmath73 with a constant slope to @xmath74 .",
    "the three disk profiles are then combined and deprojected via abel inversion in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "we assume an inclination of @xmath75 .",
    "the inclinations of the combined disk components imply an ellipticity of @xmath76 .",
    "our composite bulge profile is deprojected in a similar fashion , assuming a constant ellipticity of 0.25 @xcite .",
    "we then add @xmath77 to obtain the total luminosity density distribution @xmath78 input to our models .",
    "the globular cluster luminosity density profile is obtained via a similar deprojection , but with the additional assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "the normalization of the gc light profile is irrelevant , as our models fit only to the slope of the profile .",
    "kinematics for ngc  4594 come from four sources .",
    "the first uses near - ir data from gemini / gnirs long - slit observations along the major axis .",
    "these data were taken under good seeing conditions ( around 05 ) and has high @xmath79 .",

    "we use this psf for the dynamical models .",
    "we use a custom pipeline to reduce the gnirs data ; however , it produces very similar results to the gemini gnirs reduction package .",
    "the pipeline includes dark subtraction , wavelength calibration for the individual exposures , sky subtraction , registration and summing .",

    "while in general for other galaxies one of the biggest sources of systematic uncertainty is inclination , for ngc  4594 inclination uncertainties are unimportant .",

    "instead , our results mirror those of @xcite in ngc 4649 where the inclusion of a dm halo does not significantly change the modeled .",
    "the likely explanation for this behavior is the inclusion of high resolution _",
    "kinematics in both ngc 4649 and ngc  4594 .",

    "having already determined the orbital weights that provide the best fit to the data , we reconstruct the internal unprojected moments of the distribution function . we perform this analysis on our best fit model and the models that define the 68% confidence region ( over all combinations of the four model parameters ) , yielding internal moments at each grid cell .",
    "we define the tangential velocity dispersion to be @xmath147 where @xmath148 is actually the second moment , containing contributions from both streaming and random motion in the @xmath149 direction .",
    "figure [ vr_vt ] shows the radial run of the ratio @xmath150 .",
    "the second moment of the df is tangentially biased where the disk is important ( gray region ) as expected but mostly is isotropic elsewhere .",

    "we discuss the position of ngc  4594 on the @xmath6-@xmath7 and @xmath6-@xmath8 relations , as defined by @xcite ( 2009b , hereafter ) and compare our values of the correlation parameters to previous measurements .",
    "we calculate the effective velocity dispersion @xmath5 similar to      where @xmath152 is the rotational velocity and @xmath153 is the surface brightness profile .",
    "this makes @xmath5 essentially the surface - brightness - weighted second moment . instead of integrating from the center of the galaxy ( @xmath154 ) as did ,",
    "we integrate from @xmath155 to ensure that we do not bias @xmath5 with the high dispersion near the black hole .",
    "our outermost kinematic data point is at @xmath156 , thus we have a gap in kinematic coverage between @xmath157 .",
    "the velocity dispersion near the end of our long - slit data is dropping sharply , however @xmath66 may still contribute to the integral for @xmath158 . to investigate this , we use the gas rotation curve presented in @xcite which extends well beyond @xmath50 . truncating the integral at @xmath156",
    "gives @xmath159 while using the extended rotation curve yields @xmath160 .",
    "the problem with this definition of @xmath5 is that it includes a contribution from the rotation of the disk .",
    "it has been shown that black hole mass does not correlate with disk properties @xcite so this is not ideal .",
    "however , to compare with we must be consistent in our calculation of @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore quote this value of @xmath5 when we compare to the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation determined by . as we expect black hole mass to track bulge quantities ,",
    "disk contribution to @xmath5 is likely to add a source of intrinsic scatter to spiral galaxies in the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation .",
    "in fact , spiral galaxies are observed to have larger scatter about @xmath6-@xmath7 than ellipticals of similar @xmath5 .",
    "we also discuss some possible alternatives to @xmath5 where we attempt to remove the disk contribution .",
    "one option is to remove @xmath161 from equation ( [ sigmae ] ) altogether .",
    "bulges are known to rotate , however , @xcite and this will likely underestimate @xmath5 .",
    "this crude calculation gives @xmath162 .",
    "another option is to assume some degree of bulge rotation a priori .",
    "if we assume ngc  4594 rotates isotropically @xcite , then its flattening determines its position on the @xmath163 diagram @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows that the relation      approximates the isotropic rotator line to roughly @xmath70 accuracy .",
    "we use our value of the bulge ellipticity @xmath165 in equation ( [ v / sigma ] ) and assume this value of @xmath166 applies globally to the entire bulge .",
    "we then use our measured dispersion profile @xmath167 to determine the bulge velocity @xmath168 . using these quantities , we determine @xmath169 . we compare this to the kinematics listed in @xcite .",
    "these data include long - slit spectra taken at a position angle parallel to the major axis , but @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath139 above it . from these data ,",
    "it is apparent that the bulge @xmath7 off the major axis is roughly constant at @xmath172 .",
    "the rotation velocity rises from 0 to @xmath173 at large radii .",
    "we estimate the luminosity - weighted mean @xmath174 . adding this in quadrature to the constant bulge @xmath175 gives @xmath176 .",
    "this estimate does not contain any rotation from the disk , and is consistent with our determination of @xmath177 obtained by assuming a constant @xmath166 .",
    "our black hole mass @xmath0 agrees nicely with that of which uses the value .",
    "in fact , when corrected for their various distance determinations , most values of in the literature agree quite well ( , @xcite , , @xcite ) despite the many modeling techniques and datasets used .",
    "this is likely due to the high degree of isotropy as evidenced in figure [ vr_vt ] , deduced from the @xmath163 diagram @xcite , and noted in .",
    "figure [ msigma ] plots the position of ngc  4594 on the @xmath6-@xmath7 and @xmath6-@xmath8 relations .",
    "we plot each determination of @xmath5 in the left - hand panel .",
    "straightforward application of equation ( [ v / sigma ] ) leads to a value of @xmath5 that falls directly on the @xmath6-@xmath7 line ( blue asterisk ) .",
    "next closest is the method of calculating @xmath5 by assuming a value of @xmath166 ( green square ) .",
    "this point lies @xmath178 dex above the line , however this is still within the estimated scatter .",
    "the calculation of @xmath5 that ignored all rotation is , not surprisingly , farthest from the line .",
    "calculation of the relevant quantities for comparison with the @xmath6-@xmath8 relation is straightforward , and we plot our value of and @xmath11 ( green square ) along with that from in the right - hand panel .      as demonstrated in section [ orbitstructure ] , we find significant radial anisotropy in the globular clusters .",
    "it is interesting that the stellar kinematics at smaller radii do not show this feature .",
    "this difference in orbital properties combined with the difference in their light profiles might suggest the gcs and stars are two distinct populations of tracer particles .",
    "this could also indicate the two populations have different formation scenarios .",
    "unfortunately , there is no radius in the galaxy where we have simultaneous coverage of both stellar and gc kinematics .",
    "thus , we are unable to test whether the stellar orbits become more radial in the @xmath179 between where the stellar kinematics run out and the gcs begin . however , since the light profiles of both populations are significantly different ( figure [ allcomps ] ) there is no reason to assume they should share similar orbit properties .",
    "figure [ vr_vt ] shows the globular clusters in ngc  4594 are radially anisotropic ( @xmath180 ) over roughly the radial range @xmath181-@xmath182 ( approximately 1 - 10 @xmath50 ) .",
    "previous studies of the gc systems of galaxies have found their velocity ellipsoids to be isotropic @xcite",
    ". however , these studies used spherical jeans modeling instead of the more general axisymmetric schwarzschild code we use .",
    "@xcite determine with high confidence that the color distribution of the gc system in ngc  4594 is bimodal .",
    "this may indicate different subpopulations of gcs with different orbital properties that formed at different epochs in the galaxy s history .",
    "in our analysis , we make no distinction between red and blue subpopulations .",
    "we use the light profile and kinematics of all available gcs , regardless of color .",
    "however , since we use different sources for our kinematics and photometry data , there is the possibility that each source draws from a different gc subpopulation .",
    "the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath123 of our model dark halo imply a central dark matter density of @xmath183 using an improved jeans modeling technique , @xcite model ngc  4594 and find a dark matter halo with central density @xmath184 , ten times lower than our value .",
    "they , however , measure a larger stellar @xmath185 in the bulge .",
    "we plot the fraction of enclosed mass that is dark matter as a function of half - light radius @xmath50 in figure [ fracdm ] . at @xmath96 @xmath50",
    "there is already a roughly @xmath186-@xmath186 mix of stars and dm . inside of @xmath50",
    "the dark matter still contributes a non - negligible fraction to the total mass content .    in a study measuring dark matter properties in @xmath187 local ( @xmath188 ) early - type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey , @xcite find a correlation between the fraction of dark matter within @xmath50 and the logarithmic value of @xmath50 . with our measured value of @xmath50 , this correlation predicts a dark matter fraction at @xmath50 of @xmath189 .",
    "our value of @xmath4 is smaller , but still within their 68% confidence limit .",
    "@xcite derive scaling relations for halo parameters based on observations of early - type galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "these relations are constructed for similar galaxies using the same halo parameterization and modeling code used in this paper .",

    "we compare to the observed relations between halo parameters @xmath123 , @xmath121 , and @xmath190 and total blue luminosity @xmath191 .",
    "our value of @xmath121 falls directly on the @xmath121-@xmath191 relation , however our measured @xmath123 is smaller by roughly an order of magnitude . since @xmath192 ,",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath123 causes our measurement of @xmath190 to be high when compared to the @xcite @xmath190-@xmath191 relation .",
    "scatter in this relation is large , however , and the environment of ngc  4594 is different from that of the coma galaxies .",
    "@xcite also derive scaling laws for similar parameters in galaxies of later hubble type ( sc - im ) .",
    "we measure a much higher density and much smaller core radius than the @xcite relations imply at the @xmath191 of ngc  4594 .",
