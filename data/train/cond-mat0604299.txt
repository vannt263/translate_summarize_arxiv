    "with their ability to self - assemble , block copolymers are a natural choice of material to be utilized in the fabrication of devices incorporating periodic arrays @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty with the process , however , is that the system rarely forms a single domain of such an array , so a desirable long - range order is absent .",
    "furthermore , preferential interactions between the blocks and substrate can cause the array to be aligned in a direction other than the one desired for use .",
    "alignment of domains can be obtained in several ways , of which the one of interest to us is the use of an electric field @xcite .",
    "this takes advantage of the fact that the two blocks in general have different dielectric constants , so that it is favorable for the array to align itself such that there is as little induced polarization charge as possible@xcite . for lamellar- and cylinder - forming diblocks",
    ", this means that a sufficiently strong field will align the array with lamellae or cylinders oriented with their long symmetry axis parallel to the applied field , perpendicular to the electric plates .",
    "if one assumes that the system , in zero external electric field , is characterized by layers of cylinders lying parallel to the substrate and , in large external fields , is characterized by all cylinders oriented perpendicular to the field , then one would like to know both the equilibrium morphology at intermediate field strengths and the phase diagram of the system .",
    "two possibilities were suggested by thurn - albrecht et al .",
    "@xcite . in the first",
    ", the electric field has essentially little effect on the arrangement of parallel cylinders up to the field strength at which the perpendicular morphology becomes the globally stable phase .",
    "if this situation obtains , one expects that the difference in electrostatic energies of the two configurations would be @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the area of each plate , and @xmath2 the distance between plates .",
    "hence a first - order transition would take place at a critical electric field , @xmath3 such that @xmath4 in the second scenario , an intermediate phase is formed , one in which the surface field is sufficiently strong that a boundary layer near the plates has a different morphology than in the rest of the film . as thurn - albrecht et al .",
    "reported observing cylinders both in parallel and perpendicular orientations _ over a range of field strengths _ , the implication was that while the cylinders were oriented perpendicular to the substrate in most of the film , the boundary layer might consist of cylinders oriented parallel to the surface .",
    "the difference in electrostatic energies between the perpendicular phase and this intermediate phase is , then , not @xmath5 but @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a length characteristic of the thickness of the boundary layer .",
    "presumably it depends only weakly on the film thickness , @xmath2 .",
    "thus one expects that @xmath8 also varies only weakly with thickness for thick films .",
    "thurn - albrecht et al.@xcite did indeed find that the critical electric field , beyond which only the perpendicular phase was observed , was relatively constant for large film thicknesses .",
    "the existence of an intermediate phase is a consequence of the competition between the surface fields , which prefer a phase in which the cylinders are parallel to the surface , and the electric field which prefers that the cylinders be aligned with it , perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "if the system were semi - infinite , the intermediate phase would simply be labeled a surface phase , one of different symmetry than that of the bulk , a very common situation @xcite .",
    "such a phase would be expected to persist in the case of a finite , thick film .",
    "however when the film is sufficiently thin , the clear distinction between bulk and surface properties can no longer be made , and the two orientations compete throughout the film , resulting in the elimination of one of them .",
    "most theoretical work on block - copolymers in electric fields has focused on lamellar - forming phases , as opposed to cylindrical ones , and on the dynamic mechanisms by which morphologies could realign , rather than on the equilibrium morphologies themselves .",
    "such dynamic mechanisms were the subject of the seminal papers of amundson et al .",
    "@xcite , and of more recent dynamic density functional calculations @xcite .",
    "the form of the equilibrium phases was taken up by pereira and williams @xcite and by tsori and andelman @xcite .",
    "both groups considered one intermediate phase in which a single lamella at the plates remains parallel to them , although surface fields could conceivably lead to a sequence of intermediate phases distinguished by the number of lamellae parallel to the surface .",
    "such a discrete increase , or decrease , of the number of lamellae with applied field would be analogous to the layer - by - layer growth modes observed in adsorbed films @xcite .",
    "both groups presented phase diagrams as functions of applied electric field and film thickness .",
    "although similar , they differ in one respect : that of tsori and andelman shows the perpendicular phase to be favored always at sufficiently large external fields , which is certainly correct .",
    "the effects of surface fields have also been explored @xcite . as expected",
    ", a strong surface field favors the formation of an intermediate phase .",
    "the evolution of morphology with external field in a single lamella has recently been studied by matsen using self - consistent field theory @xcite .",
    "as for cylindrical - forming diblocks in an external electric field , the only published work has again focused on the mechanisms of morphology realignment .",
    "this has been studied experimentally @xcite , and also theoretically by dynamical self - consistent field theory @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that one follows the dynamics of the system , and one can clearly see how different are the pathways towards an equilibrium morphology depending upon the initial configuration .",
    "the actual equilibrium morphologies , which are the focus of our interest , are difficult to achieve however , just as they often are in experiment .",
    "some insight into the expected phase diagram of the cylinder - forming diblock copolymer system can be garnered from the behavior of the lamellar - forming ones . in both systems ,",
    "surface fields prefer an orientation which is different from that preferred by the electric field .",
    "it should be noted that this holds irrespective of whether the surface fields prefer one monomer species , @xmath9 , or the other , @xmath10 .",
    "thus we should expect to obtain a phase of cylinders parallel to the surface when the electric field is weak , a phase of perpendicular cylinders when the electric field is strong , and an intermediate phase for thick films , and ones subject to large surface fields .",
    "the principal difference between the cylinder- and lamellar - forming systems will be in the symmetry of the surface phase .",
    "similarly the principle difference between cylinder - formers adsorbed on a substrate that prefers the minority monomer , @xmath9 , and those adsorbed on a surface preferring the majority monomer , @xmath10 , will be in the specific morphology of the surface phase .",
    "otherwise the general form of the phase diagrams of these systems is expected to be similar due to the identity of the underlying physics .    in this paper , we study a cylinder - forming block - copolymer system in external electric fields and examine the morphology and phase behavior in the presence of surface fields which prefer the minority monomer . in section",
    "ii , we first show that some general features of the surface phase diagram in the electric field - chemical potential plane are easily discerned from basic thermodynamics , and without detailed calculation .",
    "however thermodynamics does not tell us the nature of the intermediate phases , while specific calculation does .",
    "we then turn to self - consistent field theory , and solve exactly the self - consistent equations and the maxwell equations in the manner used by us previously for a bulk phase@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the same idea has been employed with a different technical implementation in other systems @xcite . as a consequence of solving the maxwell equations",
    "exactly , we do not assume , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the effect of the electric field is weak ; that is , that the fractional variation of the dielectric constant throughout the morphology is small @xcite .",
    "our results are presented in section iii . for weak surface fields , or thin films ,",
    "there is no intermediate phase , and we find the first of the scenarios suggested by thurn - albrecht et al@xcite .",
    "the phase of parallel cylinders transforms directly to one of perpendicular cylinders . these cylinders are , of course , affected in their structure by the presence of the substrate surface fields , but a cross - section parallel to the substrate confirms the hexagonal order , even very close to the substrate .    for stronger surface fields or thicker films ,",
    "we find an intermediate phase in which a layer adjacent to the plates has a different morphology than that of the field - aligned cylinders in the rest of the film .",
    "the morphology is not one of cylinders parallel to the plates , but has the same hexagonal symmetry as a cross - section of the field - aligned aligned cylinders .",
    "however the distribution of monomers is altered so that the monomer favored by the surface field occupies a larger surface area than it would had the cylinders extended to the surface .    we conclude with a brief discussion and comparison of our results with experiment . in particular we find , in agreement with experiment in the presence of strong surface fields , that the phase boundary between the perpendicular phase and the intermediate phase is a weak function of film thickness for large thicknesses .",
    "along this locus of first order transitions , the perpendicular and intermediate phases coexist .",
    "however as we just noted , the boundary layer of the intermediate phase does not consist of cylinders parallel to the substrate .",
    "thus parallel cylinders do not exist in either phase , and one would not observe _ in equilibrium _",
    ", along this particular phase boundary , the coexistence of cylinders in both parallel and perpendicular orientations .",
    "because we are dealing with a surface film , we consider the excess free energy per unit area , or surface free energy per unit area , @xmath11 , defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath12 be the total free energy of the system of volume @xmath13 such that the free energy per unit volume , @xmath14 is the legendre transform of the energy per unit volume , @xmath15 , with respect to the entropy density , @xmath16 , number density , @xmath17 , and displacement field i.e. @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the volume - averaged displacement and electric fields . then the excess free energy per unit area , @xmath21 , is @xmath22 with the differential @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the excess entropy per unit area , @xmath25 the excess number of particles per unit area , and @xmath26 is the externally applied field which is equal to the spatially averaged electric field @xcite . the quantity @xmath27 is the magnitude of the _ surface contribution _ to the displacement field , or surface excess displacement field @xmath28d^3 r,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the displacement field in the bulk cylindrical phase .",
    "the surface excess displacement field is in the @xmath30 direction , normal to the plates .    from this differential ,",
    "one easily finds a claussius - clapeyron equation pertaining to the surface phases .",
    "if one plots the phase diagram at fixed temperature in the electric field - chemical potential plane , then the slope of the boundary between surface phases , @xmath31 , is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the differences in the excess surface densities and displacement fields in the two phases .",
    "at zero external field , there are an infinite number of parallel phases distinguished by the integer number of layers of cylinders , and a perpendicular phase in which the cylinders are perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "the transitions between all phases are generally first - order ; those between the perpendicular and parallel phases are first - order due to the difference in symmetry between them ; those between different parallel phases are generally first order because an additional layer of parallel cylinders can not be added in a continuous manner . as one turns on the electric field ,",
    "the phase space of the perpendicular phase will increase , and that of the parallel phases will decrease .",
    "it is clear that the spatially averaged polarization will be smaller in the parallel phases than in the perpendicular phase , and so the displacement field will decrease discontinuously on entering a parallel phase from a perpendicular phase , and will increase discontinuously when leaving a parallel phase .",
    "further , the surface density is presumably a monotonically increasing function of the chemical potential .",
    "hence we expect from eq .",
    "[ cc ] to find the infinite number of parallel phases to be enclosed by phase boundaries which , if no other phases are encountered , will be in the shape of wickets .",
    "the legs of each wicket meet the @xmath35 axis perpendicularly , because @xmath36 in the absence of a field .",
    "the top of each wicket is locally horizontal , and the field at which it occurs defines the critical voltage at which that parallel phase disappears . in the region of phase space",
    "in which an intermediate phase appears , the claussius - clapeyron equation can be applied to the phase boundaries between it and the parallel phases , and between it and the perpendicular phase to obtain useful information relating the surface densities and displacement fields in the coexisting phases .",
    "it can also be applied , of course , to the lamellar - forming systems @xcite .",
    "another useful result , @xmath37 follows from the differential eq .",
    "[ difsigma ] .",
    "we note that , whereas that component of the bulk , spatially averaged , displacement which is along the direction of the external field must be positive @xcite , that same component of the excess surface displacement need _ not _ be .",
    "in fact , as we expect that the presence of the surface can only disrupt the perfect alignment of the cylinders with the electric field , at least near the surfaces , we anticipate that @xmath38 will be _ negative_. it follows from eq .",
    "[ displacement ] that the excess free energy per unit area will _ increase _ with increasing electric field .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior of the _ total _ free energy , @xmath12 , and free energy per unit volume , @xmath39 , which _ decrease _ with increasing external field .",
    "the method we employ has been described previously @xcite for a bulk system , and simply needs known modifications for the case of a surface film@xcite .",
    "thus its presentation here can be brief .",
    "we consider a melt of @xmath40 a - b diblock copolymer chains , each of polymerization index @xmath41 .",

    "we also assume that the kuhn lengths of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 components are identical , a length denoted @xmath43 .",

    "the plates are normal to the @xmath30 axis , and the applied field is along the positive direction .",
    "the fraction of the volume occupied by polymer is denoted @xmath45 and is unity in the film except near the plates where it falls to zero .",
    "self - consistent field theory leads to a free energy , f , which is a functional of unknown fields , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and the unknown electric potential , @xmath49 , and a function of temperature , @xmath50 , volume , @xmath51 , and area , @xmath1 . in an ensemble in which the external electric potential , @xmath52 , is held fixed @xcite ,",

    "we next show , in fig .",
    "7 , the phase diagram for the weaker surface field of strength @xmath137 again , we chose @xmath138 one sees that the weaker surface field can no longer impose a surface morphology which differs from , yet coexists with , that of the remainder of the film , even for ones sufficiently thick to accommodate seven parallel layers . thus there is no intermediate phase . instead , with increasing external field , transitions from all cylindrical phases shown , up to seven parallel layers , are directly to the perpendicular phase .",
    "the maximum critical fields of the transition between parallel and perpendicular phases vary as @xmath139 as expected .",
    "this behavior is shown in the inset .",
    "the six maximum critical fields are shown by the open triangles which fall on a straight line in this plot .",
    "we have applied self - consistent field theory to a planar film of cylindrical - forming block copolymers .",
    "the plates between which the film is adsorbed prefer the minority @xmath9 component . in the absence of an electric field , this causes the morphology to be that of cylinders whose axes are parallel to that of the plates .",
    "we have studied the equilibrium phase diagram in the presence of an applied electric field which tends to align the cylinders perpendicular to the plates , and have solved the maxwell equations without approximation .",
    "the behavior as a function of field and film thickness is , for the most part , similar to that of lamellar - forming dibocks .",
    "as argued above , this is because the underlying physics , that of the competition between bulk and surface phases , is the same . in particular for weak surface fields or thin films , the surface field can not impose a surface morphology which differs from the rest of the film , so that there is no intermediate phase .",
    "the first - order transition with increasing electric field from the phase of parallel cylinders to that of perpendicular cylinders is direct .",
    "however for stronger surface fields and thicker films , an intermediate phase does appear , one which is characterized by a boundary layer near the plates .",
    "the nature of this boundary layer is very different for cylinder - forming diblocks than for lamellar - forming ones for which this layer is simply a modulated lamellae .",
    "we considered different possibilities for this boundary layer . because of the experimental report of a signal indicating the presence of both perpendicular and parallel cylinders@xcite",
    ", we considered whether a layer near the plates might consist of parallel cylinders , but found that it did not .",
    "in retrospect , this is not difficult to understand .",
    "first , the perpendicular cylinders aligned with the field could not connect in a simple periodic manner with cylinders aligned parallel to the plates as the two arrays would be incommensurate .",
    "thus one of the two arrays would have to be distorted , with a concomitant increase of free energy .",
    "second , the substrate does not favor parallel cylinders _ per se _ , rather it favors one monomer over the other , the minority @xmath9 monomer in our case . in zero electric field ,",
    "parallel cylinders are favored over perpendicular ones because the area of @xmath9 monomers presented to the plates is larger in the former than in the latter .",
    "the ratio of areas is @xmath140 . in a non - zero field which favors the intermediate phase",
    ", however , the area presented to the plates by parallel cylinders is less than that presented in the configuration of hexagonal symmetry which we obtained and which is shown in fig .",
    "5 . in this case",
    "the ratio of areas is @xmath141 .",
    "we also note that this particular pattern of the surface layer derives from the fact that the minority @xmath9 component is favored by the surface .",
    "were the @xmath10 component favored , as is the case in the system of xu et al .",
    "@xcite , one would expect the minority core of the cylinders to extend all the way to the plates over a range of surface fields , something which could be technologically useful . only for very strong fields",
    "would the plates be essentially covered by the majority @xmath10 component which would require the interior of the cylinders containing the @xmath9 component to be truncated near the surface .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the dynamic self - consistent field theory results as seen in fig .",
    "11(b ) of xu et al . @xcite and fig . 5 of lyakhova et al .",
    "@xcite .    we have found a transition from the intermediate phase to the perpendicular phase for which the electric field needed to bring about the transition varies only weakly with film thickness .",
    "it would seem that this could be identified with the transition observed by thurn - albrecht et al@xcite .",
    "there are , however , two difficulties with this interpretation .",
    "the first is that the electric field values at the transition are , in our calculation , larger than those observed in experiment .",
    "further , the strength of the surface field in our calculation is weaker than that estimated in experiment . were we to calculate critical electric fields for the stronger substrate fields of experiment , we would obtain even larger values as the critical electric field is expected to increase as the square root of the surface field .",
    "this comparison is reminiscent of that between calculated @xcite and experimental @xcite electric field values for the transition from a body - centered cubic phase to a cylindrical phase in which the former were also much larger than the latter .",
    "explanations for this have been proposed @xcite which may resolve this difficulty .",
    "even so , there remains the fact that , in the calculated intermediate phase , there are no cylinders in the parallel orientation .",
    "therefore one would not observe _ in equilibrium _ the existence of both parallel and perpendicular cylinders along the phase coexistence of the intermediate and perpendicular phases .",
    "the resolution of this difficulty may be that , as the system cools from the disordered into the ordered phase , cylinders are nucleated near the plates in a configuration parallel to them while the major part of the film nucleates cylinders aligned with the electric field .",
    "rearrangement of cylinders near the plates into that boundary layer which we predict to be the equilibrium one would presumably be a very slow process .",
    "if the boundary layer did not attain its equilibrium configuration , the experimental signal which detects both orientations of cylinders could be understood .",
