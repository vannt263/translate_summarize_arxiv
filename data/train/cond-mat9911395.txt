    "randomness in the transmission of discrete charge carriers in mesoscopic conductors leads to the fluctuations of the electric current called shot noise .",
    "@xcite recently , shot - noise measurements are emerging as an important tool to probe carrier interactions in mesoscopic systems .",
    "@xcite as interactions between electrons can regulate their motion , this effect may be detected in the shot - noise reduction , but can not be deduced from time - averaged dc measurements .",
    "usually , the shot - noise level is said to be reduced when its spectral density is lower in respect to the poissonian value @xmath1 , which is characteristic for transmission of uncorrelated carriers .",
    "( here , @xmath2 is the electron charge and @xmath3 is the mean current . )",
    "the sub - poisson shot noise could arise due to the pauli exclusion principle or coulomb interactions .",
    "the diversity of examples is available from recent reviews .",
    "@xcite    a matter of particular interest is the significance of coulomb interactions in scattering - free or _ ballistic _ conductors .",
    "@xcite this subject is important not only from a fundamental , but also from an applied point of view . indeed , as the dimensions of practical electronic devices are scaled down , the ballistic component in carrier motion becomes dominant .",
    "@xcite then , unavoidable electric charge of carriers and their redistribution across the device both give rise to the _ charge - limited ballistic transport_. based on ballistic transport , a variety of new electronic devices is currently discussed in view of future applications to ultralarge scale integrated circuits , logic , and memory technology , @xcite and new experimental techniques , like ballistic electron emission spectroscopy , have already been realized .",
    "@xcite in charge - limited ballistic conductors the shot - noise measurements may become one of the major tools not only to identify the ballistic transport , but also to probe carrier interactions and other electronic properties .    in the absence of scattering ,",
    "the transport and noise properties of ballistic conductors are determined , to a great extent , by the contacts ( emitters ) .",
    "when the injecting contact is in a local equilibrium and the electron density injected into a ballistic conductor is low , the electron gas is nondegenerate and described by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution function . in this case , the injected electrons are statistically independent obeying the poissonian statistics .",
    "the self - consistent theory of shot - noise suppression due to coulomb interactions for this type of ballistic injection has been recently developed .",
    "@xcite however , in nanoscale devices the injected carriers may be degenerate , or income from an emitter with an extremely nonequilibrium distribution , like in a hot - electron transistor , resonant - tunneling - diode emitter , superlattice emitter , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the incoming carriers may be correlated _ a priori _ and follow non - poissonian statistics .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to develop a self - consistent theory of shot noise in two - terminal ballistic space - charge - limited conductors with an _ arbitrary _ injection energy distribution @xmath0 , which would also be valid for _ any _ given correlation properties of injected carriers . to distinguish the pure effect of coulomb interactions on the shot - noise suppression",
    ", it will be convenient to measure the noise - suppression level in respect to the shot noise of _ non - poissonian _ flow with disregarded coulomb interactions , rather than to the poissonian @xmath4 value .",
    "we have derived the analytical formulas that determine the steady - state and noise characteristics in ballistic conductors under the action of coulomb interactions in the asymptotic limit of high biases .",
    "the time - averaged quantities are found to be insensitive to @xmath0 in the leading - order terms , giving , in particular , the universal child law for the mean current .",
    "in contrast , the current noise is shown to be crucially dependent on @xmath0 , with the noise suppression ( caused by coulomb interactions ) different for different injections .",
    "the derived energy - resolved shot - noise suppression formulas indicate the possibility to probe the injection energy profile of a ballistic emitter in shot - noise measurements , thereby obtaining an important information not otherwise available from time - averaged conductance measurements . on the other hand , that information may help to optimize the injection energy distribution to achieve the desired noise - suppression level .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the basic equations that describe the space - charge - limited ballistic transport : the collisionless kinetic equation coupled self - consistently with the poisson equation .",
    "the obtained solutions allow us to find the analytical formulas for the mean current and the current fluctuation transmission expressed through the injection distribution function @xmath0 .",
    "the shot - noise suppression factor is calculated for some particular cases in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv summarizes the main contributions of the paper , whereas in the appendix we present mathematical details concerning the derivation of the self - consistent potential fluctuations .",
    "consider a two - terminal semiconductor ballistic sample with plane - parallel heavily doped contacts at @xmath5=0 and @xmath5=@xmath6 . the structure may be considered as a @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath7 heterodiode @xcite operating under a space - charge - limited current regime in which the current is determined by a charge injection from the contacts rather than by intrinsic carriers of the ballistic region . the applied bias @xmath9 between the contacts is assumed to be fixed by a low - impedance external circuit . in order to simplify the problem",
    ", we assume that due to the large difference in the carrier density between the contacts and the sample , and hence in the corresponding debye screening lengths , all the band bending occurs in the ballistic base , and therefore the relative position of the conduction band and the fermi level @xmath10 does not change in the contacts .",
    "for such a modeling , all of the potential drop takes place exclusively inside the ballistic base and the contacts are excluded from the consideration . @xcite",
    "in contrast to refs .  , the injected carriers are not restricted to follow a thermal equilibrium distribution , their distribution is an arbitrary function determined by the particular properties of the emitter . assuming the transversal size of the conductor sufficiently thick and high enough electron density , the electrostatic problem may be considered in a one - dimensional plane geometry .",
    "@xcite      a semiclassical ballistic transport is described by the collisionless kinetic equation for the time - dependent distribution function @xmath11 coupled self - consistently with the poisson equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath12 ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the dielectric permittivity , and @xmath15 the electron effective mass . since during the ballistic motion only the longitudinal momentum @xmath16 may vary , we use the electron distribution function averaged over the transversal momentum @xmath17 according to    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the dimension of a momentum space and @xmath20 is the occupation number of a quantum state at the cross section @xmath5 .",

    "the distribution function @xmath23 and the potential @xmath24 fluctuate in time around their time - averaged values .",
    "the nonuniform distribution of the injected carriers creates the potential minimum @xmath25 at a position @xmath26 , which also fluctuates .",
    "it is the potential minimum fluctuations , that leads to the suppression of the injected current fluctuations .",
    "@xcite we assume that the applied bias is much larger than the characteristic energy spreading of injected electrons , so that the current injection from the second ( receiving ) contact is negligible .",
    "another assumption is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the bias at which the potential barrier vanishes .",
    "@xcite this assumption may be fulfilled under the condition of a strong screening that corresponds to the so - called `` virtual cathode '' approximation , when the potential minimum is so close to the contact , that one can disregard the region between the contact and the minimum .",
    "@xcite in this limit , only those electrons that are able to pass over the fluctuating barrier ( _ transmitted _ electrons ) , contribute to the current and noise .",
    "it is advantageous to use as a variable in the equations , instead of the kinetic energy , the total energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mean potential referenced to the minimum . by such a definition , @xmath32 in all the region ( which is convenient for further consideration ) , whereas the potential energy @xmath33 is negative .",
    "equation ( [ vlasns ] ) , for the stationary case ( @xmath34=0 ) , in terms of these variables may be written as @xmath35=0 .",
    "its solution , being invariant on @xmath5 , is expressed simply through the distribution function at the injecting contact @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the potential at the contact , and the heaviside step function @xmath39 establishes the lower bound for the transmitted electrons .",
    "the fluctuation @xmath40 is found from linearization of eq .",

    "equivalently , one may just perturb the steady - state solution ( [ fst ] ) as a compound function , and get    @xmath41    taking into account that the perturbation of the total energy @xmath42 is related to the perturbation of the potential by @xmath43=@xmath44 and using the property @xmath45=@xmath46 , one finally obtains @xcite    @xmath47    the self - consistent potential fluctuations are defined as @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "this means that @xmath50 is measured in a frame referenced to the _ fluctuating _ potential minimum ( @xmath51=0 ) .",
    "it is clear , that in such a consideration the contact potential and its fluctuation are related to the potential barrier height according to @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "equations ( [ fst ] ) and ( [ df ] ) should now be substituted into the poisson equations for @xmath54 and @xmath50 , correspondingly , to find the self - consistent potential profile and its fluctuation .",

    "for the particular case when the injected carriers of different energies are uncorrelated ,    @xmath108    the shot - noise suppression factor ( [ sup ] ) is simplified to    @xmath109    furthermore , for the poissonian injection , the property of the kernel @xmath110 is such that @xmath111 .",

    "both conditions may be fulfilled simultaneously under a sufficiently strong screening , i.e. , the length of the conductor should be much larger than the characteristic screening length",
    "to illustrate the implementation of the results , we consider some examples . for the maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) injection distribution ( nondegenerate equilibrium electron gas is injected ) we obtain @xmath115 , i.e. , it only depends on the temperature of the injected electrons , but otherwise is independent of the material parameters , since its dependence on the barrier height is canceled out . for this case",
    "( [ gamma ] ) gives    @xmath116    which coincides with the formula derived by north .",
    "@xcite the corresponding shot - noise - suppression factor follows from eq .",

    "@xcite for the contact doping @xmath120 at @xmath121=50 k , we obtain the injected electron density about @xmath122 which corresponds to the debye screening length @xmath123=46 nm . then for the @xmath124-length diode and @xmath125 , the noise - suppression level estimated from the exact solutions @xcite gives @xmath126 , which is close to the value calculated from the asymptotic formula ( [ gammaxw ] ) .",
    "now we shall demonstrate , that the shot - noise suppression level may be achieved even deeper than that given by eq .",
    "( [ gammaxw ] ) for the mb case , without involving any other correlations ( like the pauli exclusion principle ) in addition to the coulomb correlations .",
    "the higher suppression may be achieved by modifying the energy profile for the injected carriers .",
    "consider the heterodiode under the same set of parameters considered above , in which , in addition to the maxwell - boltzmann injection , nonequilibrium carriers are injected from a specially designed emitter , so that the injected distribution function has an additional peak at the energy @xmath127 [ see inset of fig .",
    "according to our theory , these additional electrons do not change the current - voltage characteristics much .",
    "its asymptotic behavior is again the child law .",
    "however , the noise properties change significantly depending on the parameters of the electron - energy peak , its magnitude , position , etc .",
    "in particular , the noise - suppression level may be obtained lower or higher than the mb shot noise by simply shifting the position of the peak ( of the emitter ) in respect to the potential barrier .",
    "let us assume that the width of the peak is narrow on the scale of the temperature @xmath121 . for simplicity , we model it first by a @xmath128 function ( monoenergetic electrons )    @xmath129",
    "the injected carriers , from both the maxwellian tail and the peak , are assumed to be uncorrelated , so that eq .  ( [ suppois ] ) can be applied .",
    "thus , for the distribution ( [ distdelt ] ) one gets the ( normalized ) characteristic velocity ( [ vv ] ) as    @xmath130    where @xmath131 is the ratio between the two currents : from the @xmath128 peak and from the mb exponential tail , and @xmath132 is the dimensionless position of the peak .",
    "the shot - noise - suppression factor is then obtained as    @xmath133    = 8.0 cm    in the limit when the electron - energy peak vanishes , @xmath134 , formula ( [ gamdelt ] ) is reduced to the suppression factor ( [ gammaxw ] ) for the mb injection .",
    "we have studied how @xmath135 deviates from @xmath136 when the peak current @xmath137 and the peak position @xmath138 are varied .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "the dependence of @xmath139 on @xmath138 was found to be nonmonotonic displaying a minimum . in some range of @xmath138 around the minimum , @xmath140 , that means the additional electron - energy peak at the injecting contact results in a less noisy transmission , than in the case of its absence .",
    "the minimal noise is observed for @xmath141 , for which we find @xmath142 at @xmath143 . as follows from fig .",
    "1(a ) , the most effective noise suppression occurs when the peak is about 12 @xmath144 above the barrier .",
    "when it is higher in energy , or too close to the barrier position ( @xmath145 ) , the noise is enhanced in respect to the mb case ( although it may still be below the poissonian value ) .    the analysis for other shapes of the peak shows that the results are similar to those for the @xmath128 peak . as an example , we present here the results for the case when the peak is modeled by the gaussian distribution function    @xmath146    where the factor @xmath147 is defined by @xmath148 \\}$ ] . by such a definition , the parameter @xmath131 gives again , as in the previous case , the ratio between the current originated from the gaussian peak and that from the mb tail . a comparison between the two cases is presented in fig .",
    "it is seen , that at high values of @xmath138 the results for the noise suppression for both cases of the gaussian and @xmath128 peak coincide .",
    "it can be shown , that this occurs at @xmath149 .",
    "hence , when the peak width @xmath150 , the minimal noise occurs at the same peak position @xmath151 , independently of the value of @xmath152 .",
    "the information on the peak width is presented , however , in the noise - suppression curves at low values of @xmath138 .",
    "while @xmath135 for the @xmath128 peak case diverges at @xmath153 , due to a singularity of the @xmath128 function , the noise suppression factor for the gaussian - peak case exhibits a local maximum [ see figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) ] .",
    "the magnitude of this noise enhancement ( in respect to the mb case ) depends on @xmath152 : the narrower the peak , the larger the noise enhancement and the closer is the location of the maximum to the potential barrier energy [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] .    summarizing this example , to observe the lower noise level for nondegenerate ballistic electrons , the additional ( to the mb tail ) electrons should be injected with the energy about 1.45 @xmath144 above the potential barrier .",
    "this value is independent of the energy spreading of the `` peak '' electrons once the latter is less than 0.3 @xmath144 .",
    "the optimal ratio between the current from the `` peak '' electrons and the mb electrons is about 0.6 .",
    "it is seen , that the shot noise contains important information on : ( i ) the injection energy profile , and ( ii ) the parameters of the injected space charge , such as the potential barrier height and the electron density @xmath92 at the barrier position .",
    "therefore , noise measurements may be used as a tool to study those characteristics .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a self - consistent theory of transport and current noise in two - terminal ballistic space - charge - limited conductors under the action of coulomb interactions .",
    "we have derived the analytical formulas that account for the non - poissonian injection with arbitrary distribution function and correlation properties of injected electrons , and these may be used to estimate : ( i ) the mean current beyond the child approximation with a next - order term specific of the injection distribution function ; ( ii ) the current - noise spectral density under the action of coulomb interactions , which depends in the leading - order terms on the injection distribution function and decreases with bias ; ( iii ) the noise - suppression factor in respect to the injected non - poissonian electron flow . @xcite    the obtained analytical formula for the energy - resolved shot - noise suppression may suggest a new field of investigation on the optimization of the injection energy profile to achieve the desired noise suppression level",
    ". the presented examples clearly show , that the noise - suppression level may be controlled by monitoring the injection energy profile .",
    "the sensitivity of the noise - suppression level to the injection parameters opens up new perspectives in shot - noise measurements as a tool not only to identify the ballistic transport in mesoscopic conductors , but also to reveal an important information on the injection energy profile and the level of coulomb interactions in the structure .",
    "experiments have succeeded recently in observing shot noise in ballistic quantum point contacts @xcite and some other mesoscopic systems ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "we believe , that it would be similarly possible to measure the shot noise in space - charge limited ballistic conductors .    additionally , it is important to emphasize the difference between the asymptotic behavior of the shot noise in diffusive and ballistic systems under the presence of a space charge . in the former case the noise - suppression level",
    "is limited by the constant , specific of the dominating scattering mechanism , @xcite while in the latter the suppression may be arbitrarily strong , which may be important from the point of view of possible applications .",
