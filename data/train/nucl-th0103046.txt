    "in the @xmath3 region of the rare - earth nuclei , three bands are observed to interact with each other at @xmath4 .",
    "the bands are g- , s- and t - bands . the g- and",
    "s - bands are well - known rotational bands of the ground state and rotation - aligned configurations , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the t - band means `` tilted - rotating '' band which was proposed by frauendorf @xcite . in @xmath5os ,",
    "the t - band has a @xmath6 band head , while @xmath1os has @xmath7 .",
    "these high-@xmath0 states are assigned to two quasi - particle excitations in the neutron i@xmath8 orbits . because the neutron fermi levels in these nuclei are in the high-@xmath9 orbits in the i@xmath8",
    ", it is expected that high-@xmath0 states are excited favourably and appear near the yrast line .",
    "these three bands , i.e. , g- and s - bands ( low-@xmath0 ) and t - band ( high-@xmath0 ) , seem to interact with each other near @xmath10 to cause a backbend in the yrast line .",
    "an interesting phenomenon here is that the t - bands split into two sequences : one of them consists of even-@xmath11 members while the other of odd-@xmath11 , which is energetically lower than the former .",
    "( see fig.[os182 ] . )",
    "therefore , it seems that so - called `` signature splitting '' and `` signature inversion '' are induced by these multi - band crossings .",
    "these phenomena are observed systematically for even - even nuclei in the @xmath3 region such as @xmath12w and @xmath13os .",
    "to explain these phenomena , i.e. , a coupling between high- and low-@xmath0 states ( in other words , break - down of the @xmath0-selection rule ) , we propose the _",
    "wobbling model_. the term `` wobbling motion '' was originally introduced into nuclear structure physics by bohr and mottelson @xcite , in order to explain excited rotational structures of triaxial nuclei .",
    "the wobbling motion in this context is considered as the small deviation or fluctuation of angular momentum from the typical collective rotation around the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the motion is quantized and presents phonon - like structures above the ground state band .",
    "on the other hand , our wobbling motion is based on the theory by kerman and onishi @xcite .",
    "it is based on the time - dependent variational model ( tdvm ) and attempts to handle general three - dimensional nuclear rotations . in our present model , we describe the wobbling state , @xmath15 , as a superposition of different tilted - axis - cranked hfb states , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined in the constraints of angular momentum . @xmath19 .",
    "( note that the tilt angle @xmath17 is measured from the @xmath14-axis to see the deviation of the rotation axis from the @xmath14-axis . )",
    "the wobbling states are written , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gcm wave function and the variation is made with respect to this function .",
    "the pairing - plus - q@xmath22q force is employed as an residual interaction for the spherical parts ( from the nilsson model ) in the hamiltonian .",
    "quantization is made through the angular momentum projection technique ( @xmath23 ) .    as a result",
    ", our wobbling motion can describe not only small but also large amplitude wobbling motion around any types of rotations ( with any kinds of deformations ) .",
    "in other words , this model describes a dynamical picture of nuclear excited modes such as rotations and vibrations .",
    "fig.[wobble ] shows schematically how the wobbling motion occurs .",
    "as a nucleus rotates rapidly , the rotation - alignment occurs , in both of the g- and t - bands . as a result ,",
    "the yrast band takes on the s - band character ( left panel ) and the t - band has some amount of fluctuations in @xmath0-distribution as well ( center panel ) .",
    "as the nucleus rotates more rapidly , the @xmath0 fluctuation around high- and low-@xmath0 components spreads and finally there is an overlap between them ( right panel ) . as a result , the corresponding state has very large fluctuation in @xmath0 .",
    "semi - classically , this state coupling low-@xmath0 states with high-@xmath0 can be pictured as the wobbling motion .",
    "we performed numerical calculations and confirmed that the wobbling model can describe the main features of the multi - bands crossing phenomena .",
    "particularly , our calculations can reproduce the coupling of low- and high-@xmath0 components in the yrast and excited bands through the crossing .",
    "( see fig.[calc ] . )",
    "then , we propose an interpretation for the mechanism of the signature inversion through the wobbling model : first , as a result of the rotation - alignment , the yrast line takes on the s - band character ; then , the t - band approaches to the yrast line and inter - band interactions start between even-@xmath11 members of the t - band and members in the s - band , while odd-@xmath11 members in the t - band are unperturbed because there are no counterparts in the yrast band .",
    "thus , the even-@xmath11 members are pushed up from the original t - band sequence while the odd-@xmath11s keep staying in the sequence .",
    "this mechanism can explain the signature inversion ( and splitting ) phenomena .",
    "at the same time , the yrast line is pushed down through the inter - band interaction , and as a consequence backbending can be enhanced .",
    "the detailed results and discussions are presented in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "in @xmath1os , there is an isomer with @xmath24 , and its rotational band seems to be isolated .",
    "thus , it is expected to have a pure high-@xmath0 ( @xmath25 ) structure ( at least , no low-@xmath0 component ) .",
    "podolyk et al .",
    "@xcite have measured the effect of low-@xmath0 components in the t - band ( @xmath7 ) by the comparison of the transition rates between these two high-@xmath0 bands ( i.e.,@xmath7 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is hoped to identify the effect of high-@xmath0 components ( @xmath27 ) in the yrast line at high spin ( @xmath28 ) , which influences the transition probability from the @xmath29 isomer ( having a very short half life , @xmath30130 ns ) to the yrast line .",
    "( see fig.[exp1 ] . )",
    "we have investigated a mechanism of signature inversion and splitting in the @xmath3 region by means of _ gcm - after - amp _ on the tilted - axis - cranked hfb states . with this method",
    ", we have qualitatively reproduced the main features of the excited level structure in the high-@xmath0 t - band .",
    "we interpret this result from a point of view of an inter - band interaction between the low-@xmath0 ( s- ) and high-@xmath0 ( t- ) bands .",
    "we have shown that the perturbed states have the character of wobbling motion , that is , a dynamical mode coupling low-@xmath0 par ( principal - axis rotation ) and high-@xmath0 tar ( tilted - axis - rotation ) states . in terms of this wobbling model",
    ", we have discussed an enhancement of backbending in the @xmath3 region , in which the typical rotation - alignment is somewhat suppressed due to the location of the neutron fermi level",
