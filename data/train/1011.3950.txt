    "the source function is obtained from the two - particle emission function , the density of particle emission points with near - equal momenta , by projection from the two four - coordinates onto the relative three - coordinate @xmath6 ( as measured in the pair rest frame of emission point densities)@xcite .",
    "the momentum- and coordinate - space correlations of noninteracting identical particles in their centre - of - mass system are related by a fourier transform @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the correlation strength parameter and @xmath9 for noninteracting identical spin-0 and unpolarized spin-1/2 particles emitted at independent spacetime points respectively .",
    "the @xmath8-parameter may be modified by particle impurity or a contribution of the particles emitted in some multiparticle quantum states analogous to the coherent states in quantum optics .",

    "experimental data , however , is often nongaussian , sometimes strongly so .",
    "this raises two problems : first , to systematically describe the nongaussian shape of @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) in momentum space , and second , to determine parameters of @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) in coordinate space , given only the kernel transform and measurements in @xmath12-space .",

    "while fully three - dimensional formulations have been in part set out in e.g.  ref .",

    "given a measured normalised correlation function @xmath21 , its @xmath12-moments @xmath22 and @xmath12-cumulants @xmath23 of lowest orders @xmath24 provide fundamental information on its properties : the ordinary mean @xmath25 is a measure of the _ location _ of the peak of @xmath21 , while the variance @xmath26 measures the dispersion and @xmath27 the _ width _ or _ scale _ of the pdf , the skewness @xmath28 measures its _ asymmetry _ and the kurtosis @xmath29 is a first description of the pdf tail s _ decay rate_. higher - order `` generalised kurtoses '' @xmath30 would provide successively more detail .",

    "secondly , the above relations reduce to the gaussian relation @xmath46 and @xmath77 if and when the measured correlation function is gaussian since as mentioned all @xmath78 are then identically zero . in general , however , the `` radius '' @xmath79^{1/2}$ ] of the source distribution is a function also of higher - order @xmath12-cumulants , with both increasing orders @xmath31 and increasing powers of lower - order @xmath31 entering the expansions .",
    "given the symmetry between @xmath14 and @xmath12 , the corresponding expansions for @xmath56 and @xmath31 in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath51 would have the same form as the above , apart from some changes in sign .",

    "( [ xndv ] ) .",
    "the gew method might therefore be expected to work well if @xmath107-divisibility could be established for a given experimental data set .",

    "the reason for the success of gew relies not on physics assumptions , but on a better description of nongaussian systems . in statistics terms ,",
    "any deviation from the gaussian is captured by the gew series in the _ rate of approach _ of higher - order cumulants to zero with increasing @xmath107 .",
    "indeed , many proofs of the central limit theorem rely on the fact that @xmath139 immediately yields the fixed rate of convergence for any generalised kurtosis as shown in eq .",
    "( [ zetaconv ] ) .",
    "the success of gew ordering is therefore based on the fact that all contributing terms in a given order of @xmath117 have the same rate of convergence to the gaussian limit .",
    "furthermore , due to the alternating sign of @xmath71 , the sum of contributions within a given @xmath132 term tends to be substantially smaller than the individual contributions ; for example the @xmath130 term for the snig test case is made up of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , adding up to @xmath142 .",
    "it is not necessary to know the value of @xmath107 to make use of gew ordering : using ( [ zetaconv ] ) , we can merely re - absorb the @xmath125 in ( [ ewz ] ) to write the gew expansion in @xmath107-independent notation ( now with @xmath143 , the measured kurtosis ) @xmath144,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but keeping in mind that each expression within a round bracket represents a certain rate of convergence and must be included or excluded as a whole .",
    "it is not even necessary to require @xmath107-divisibility as such : for the gew ordering to be effective we require only that @xmath21 is reasonably close to a gaussian , where `` reasonable '' is typically quantified by the errors shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the derivation also does not rely on a particular form of @xmath109 other than requiring existence of its cumulants .",
    "we have calculated expressions for @xmath14-cumulants of second and fourth order for the emission region in terms of measured @xmath12-cumulants . on using a nongaussian test function to quantify accuracy of expansions , we have shown that the textbook gram - charlier series is unsuitable at any level of approximation .",
    "by contrast , the gauss - edgeworth expansion , which orders terms based on the rate of approach to a gaussian , does give results which become increasingly accurate as more terms are added .",
    "the gew series is robust in all respects ; for example it does not require @xmath107-divisibility as such but only that @xmath21 be close enough to a gaussian in the sense that the measured @xmath12-cumulants entering truncated gew expansion should have reasonable error bars .",
    "the present one - dimensional calculation clearly can not be applied immediately to experimental data , but is meant to show that , even on the fundamental level of expansions , there are major questions which must be addressed first . in sorting out the fundamental issue of re - ordering , the present results represent an important step towards a consistent framework for shape description .",
    "application to experimental data will require generalisation to three dimensions using the existing 3d machinery of refs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sampling fluctuations of experimental cumulants will have to be taken into account . in this connection",
    ", we also note that the gew ordering has the additional advantage of placing terms with higher powers of @xmath91 into lower orders of @xmath126 , making it unnecessary to measure higher - order kurtoses . based on slightly different arguments ,",
    "cramr @xcite also concluded that gew was superior to ggc ordering ; this has also been verified ggc vs gew comparisons of the nongaussian pdf itself @xcite .",
    "the gram - charlier series can therefore be considered to be inferior to the edgeworth equivalent in all respects .",
    "note that it is not necessary to measure the correlation function @xmath21 at @xmath145 , despite the fact that @xmath14-cumulants rely formally on the generating function ( [ mpx ] ) at zero .",
    "the @xmath12-cumulants themselves are functions of @xmath21 over the whole range of @xmath12 , while the correlation strength parameter @xmath8 cancels in the normalisation ( [ nmq ] ) .",
    "our final comment pertains to the usual practice of obtaining information on the correlation function through fits of nongaussian parametrisations",
    ". fits rely on an _ a priori _ choice of parametrisation , guided only by the minimisation of @xmath146 , and suffer from increasing ambiguity in higher dimensions . by relying on direct measurement of coefficients , the present method and those of refs @xcite etc",
