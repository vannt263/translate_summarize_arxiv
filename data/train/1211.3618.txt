    "we calculate how the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath4 would affect the most important system characteristic  the mass accretion rate @xmath5 of a fluid onto the center .",
    "we found that the mass accretion rate is damped by the presence of the cosmological constant .",
    "this effect is stronger for negative values than for positive values of the cosmological constant and it depends on the ratio of the dark energy density to the fluid density .    in the next two sections we remind the kottler solutions and draw the general picture of the steady accretion , together with suitable equations .",
    "sections 4 and 5 present three analytic sets of results .",
