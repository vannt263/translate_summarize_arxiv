    "we have proposed the non - deterministic two - way qkd protocol and have demonstrated the security of the proposed protocol against pns , impersonation and torjan horse attack . finally , we emphasize that the proposed protocol has the following advantages compared with the conventional qkd .",
    "1 ) the quantum correlation is established by exchanging the qubit with completely random polarization . for that reason",
    ", our protocol can be implemented with relatively dense coherent pulse .",
    "2 ) since the mean photon number @xmath5 can be safely set is much higher value than that of conventional qkd @xcite ( see the last paragraph of pns analysis ) , the corresponding raw key creation rate is higher than that of the conventional two - way qkd .",
    "3 ) the protocol provides the tunable security depending on the number of screening angle @xmath3 . even if an eavesdropper try to know the current status of the protocol by a combination of photon number quantum non - demolition measurement@xcite and unambiguous state discrimination @xcite , it can be avoided by increasing the number of screening angle @xmath3 .",

    "<S> we propose a non - deterministic two - way quantum key distribution in which the quantum correlation is established by transmitting the randomly polarized photon . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the security of the proposed quantum key distribution against photon number splitting , impersonation , and trojan horse attack and quantify the security bound against mean photon number of the coherent state pulse . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we remark the characteristic features of the protocol .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite is to generate shared secret information between distant parties with negligible leakage of the information to an eavesdropper eve . </S>",
    "<S> the security of qkd is based on the no - cloning theorem : eve can not extract any information without introducing errors @xcite , while the security of the classical key distribution or cryptography is supported by the computational complexity of the underling mathematical problems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the qkd by bennent and brassard ( bb84 ) @xcite , there has been security proof @xcite and theoretical proposals to enhance the security @xcite .    the ping - pong protocol ( pp ) proposed by bostrm et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is the first two - way quantum key distribution based on entangled qubit . </S>",
    "<S> it is a conceptually new scheme in the sense that the key is generated by the round trip of the qubit , while in the conventional qkd it is done with single trip . with this trend , lucamarini et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed the two - way protocol without entanglement by merging the peculiarities of bb84 and pp and recently , kye et . </S>",
    "<S> al . , proposed to the three - way qkd @xcite to make the encoding possible with relatively dense coherent - state pulse . </S>",
    "<S> one of the interesting aspects of their protocol is to use the qubit with random polarization , while in the conventional protocol , predefined finite number of polarization states is used @xcite .    in the multi - way quantum key distribution @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the final key is led by only one party which allows creating the key in deterministic way is considered as an advantage for the direct encoding . </S>",
    "<S> however in some cases the deterministic feature of qkd without dissipation of the qubit often provides eve with the room to track the protocol easily @xcite . that is to say the deterministic feature can play a role of potential security hole in qkd .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a non - deterministic two - way qkd in which the quantum correlation is established by transmitting the randomly polarized photon . </S>",
    "<S> the initial random polarization @xmath0 with arbitrary @xmath1 $ ] is compensated by acting the unitary operator @xmath2 on the returning qubit and the net encoding information can be extracted from that . in addition , the non - deterministic feature comes from the @xmath3 number of screening angle which is chosen by alice at the initial stage of the protocol . the key is created only when the matching condition of the corresponding screening angles is satisfied and it plays important role in blocking up the impersonation and trojan horse attack .    </S>",
    "<S> qkd using coherent - state pulse has received much attentions in regard to the practical implementation @xcite . since there is no phase reference outside alice or bob s lab , a coherent - state @xmath4 of mean photon number @xmath5 is effectively described by photon number eigenstate @xmath6 with poission distribution : @xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , our proposal has remarkable advantages for implementation using coherent - state pulse , because the protocol allows not only to transmit the relative dense coherent pulse but also to increase the raw key creation rate . </S>",
    "<S> our protocol is described as follows : + _ protocol : _    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob initiate the protocol by announcing a set @xmath8 which has @xmath3 number of screening angles , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and the screening angle @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   alice take arbitrary angle @xmath13 and chooses screening angle @xmath14 and random screening factor @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> she prepares the qubit : @xmath16 where @xmath17 for @xmath18 otherwise @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> alice occasionally takes @xmath13 with the probability @xmath20 as a predefined value @xmath21 which is called authentication angle . if @xmath22 then the protocol follows the authentication mode ( a - mode ) else transmission mode ( t - mode ) . </S>",
    "<S> 1 .   bob chooses a screening angle @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> he acts @xmath24 on the received qubit , where @xmath25 is key bit . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit becomes @xmath26 the fraction @xmath27 of the photons in the qubit enter into the bob s detector , where @xmath28 is the transmission efficiency of bob s detector . </S>",
    "<S> bob records the outcome @xmath29 in his detector . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   after acting @xmath30 on the returning qubit </S>",
    "<S> , alice has the qubit @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> she measures the qubit and the outcome is recorded as @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> alice declares the mode is a - mode , then alice and bob announce the chosen screening angles @xmath14 and @xmath23 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if the screening angles satisfy that @xmath33 then the qubit incoming to bob s detector is @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> so the corresponding outcome @xmath29 and encoded key @xmath25 are correlated by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the addition on @xmath37 space . </S>",
    "<S> if the verification is failed , alice and bob immediately terminate the protocol and initiate the protocol form ( p.1 ) later . if @xmath38 in above step alice and bob return ( p.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> 1 .   bob chooses a screening angle @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> he acts @xmath24 on the received qubit , where @xmath25 is key bit . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit becomes @xmath39 bob returns the qubit to alice . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> alice acts @xmath40 on the returning qubit and it becomes @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> alice measures the qubit and gets the outcome @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob announce the chosen screening angles @xmath14 and @xmath23 respectively . if the screening angles satisfy that @xmath42 , then alice gets the key @xmath25 for the outcome @xmath32 : @xmath43 else alice and bob go to ( p.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the desired key length is created then go to ( p.3 ) 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob create key @xmath44 and @xmath45 by concatenating key bits and exchange the hash values @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite . if @xmath48 then the key creation is finished else alice and bob start again from ( p.1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) shows alice s integrity condition observed in bob s detector(d0 , d1 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , which plays an important role to detect lethal strategy like impersonation and trojan horse attack . </S>",
    "<S> even though the key encoding is performed by bob deterministically , the final key is rearranged whether the matching condition in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) is satisfied or not . in the qkd the raw key creation rate </S>",
    "<S> depends on the number of screening angle and mode probability as @xmath49 where @xmath50 depends on implementation ( @xmath51 for our protocol ) , @xmath52 is pulse rate , @xmath53 the transmission and @xmath54 the detection efficiency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now , we shall analyze the security of the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> +    _ security against photon number splitting ( pns ) attack : _ + since a - mode is only for authenticating purpose , it is enough to consider that eve s attack is focused on the t - mode in quantifying the pns attack @xcite . as usual , we assume that eve is so superior that her action is limited only by the law of physics . against the coherent state @xmath55 from alice , she replaces the lossy channel by a perfect one and puts a beam splitter of transmission efficiency @xmath56 in the middle @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the reflected field , which is a coherent state with its amplitude @xmath57 , will be the source of information to eve . in the protocol ( t - mode.1)-(t - mode.3 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the information transmitted between alice and bob is of random polarization . in our protocol , the photon polarizations lie on the equator of the poincar sphere . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this case , eve s goal is to find the optimum state estimation from @xmath58 qubits gives the maximal mean fidelity given by @xcite : @xmath59    let us first consider the maximum information eve can get from the alice@xmath60 bob channel in ( a.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of there being @xmath58 photons of the channel in the coherent state @xmath61 is @xmath62\\frac{[(1-\\eta)\\mu]^n}{n!}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the received qubit in bob s end is @xmath63 and after transmission of the detector , it becomes @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in bob @xmath60 alice channel , the probability of there being @xmath58 photons in the coherent state @xmath65 is @xmath66\\frac{[(1-\\eta)\\eta t\\mu]^n}{n!}$ ]    then the maximum amount of information eve can get from the channel in a@xmath60b and b@xmath60a is @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum information eve can obtain is bounded by @xmath69 , which is plotted in fig . 2 for various cases . </S>",
    "<S> since the intensity of the coherent pulse decreases as the number of laps between alice and bob , @xmath70 is actually determined by @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we define the critical value of initial amplitude @xmath72 which gives the average number of photons delivered to alice about 1 after ( t - mode 3 ) . since the incoming amplitude of the coherent pulse in ( t - mode 3 ) is @xmath73 , the critical value of initial amplitude is given by @xmath74 . at the critical value of initial amplitude , maximum bound for eve s information @xmath75 , </S>",
    "<S> while the mutual information between alice and bob is unity ( if the detector of alice is not clicked in a particular time window due to the empty pulse , alice and bob could exclude the corresponding event by announcing that the pulse is empty ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , at the critical amplitude alice and bob shares @xmath76 higher information than that of eve . </S>",
    "<S> so alice and bob could create the final key through the post processing like privacy amplification @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we remark the critical mean photon number in our protocol is on @xmath77 which is at least ten times larger value than @xmath78 @xcite of conventional qkd . accordingly </S>",
    "<S> , our protocol allow the higher raw key creation rate , even though the @xmath50 factor in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) is slightly smaller that the conventional qkd .    _ </S>",
    "<S> security against impersonation attack : _ + eve can impersonate bob to alice and bob to alice in the quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> this type of attack is effective on the protocol which transmits the qubit without dissipation of the qubit @xcite . against our protocol </S>",
    "<S> , eve may consider the following strategy :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> after the step ( p2 ) eve intercepts the qubit and puts it in the quantum storage . let s call it @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> eve prepare fake qubit @xmath80 and send it to bob . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   after the step ( a - mode 1 ) or ( t - mode1 ) , eve intercepts again the qubit whose state is given by @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> eve gets the qubit @xmath82 after acting @xmath83 on the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> eve measures the qubit with guessing @xmath84 and gets the outcome @xmath85 and key @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   eve encodes the intercepted original qubit @xmath87 by acting @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the intercepted qubit becomes @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> eve sends the qubit to alice .    if eve impersonate the quantum channel during t - mode , the probability that eve s guessing of @xmath23 in ( a1.2 ) was right is @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly alice s key with eve s impersonation includes the error with the probability and it should be noticed in the step ( p.3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , if eve impersonates the quantum channel during a - mode , eve s impersonation can be also detected at the step ( a - mode 3 ) . in the step ( a1.1 ) , eve s fake qubit @xmath91 is entered into bob s detector with the transmission efficiency @xmath27 . in that case , eve s fake qubit violates with the integrity condition of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) because the probability that eve s guessing was matched with alice s authentication angle as well as screening , @xmath92 and @xmath93 is almost null ( here we use the fact that eve does not know if the protocol in a - mode or t - mode ) . </S>",
    "<S> eve s impersonation should be notice in the step ( a - mode 3 ) with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5)-(6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + _ security against trojan horse type attack : _ + eve could attach ancillary qubit to the transmitted qubit and after the bob s encoding , she reads out the encoding by measuring the ancillary qubit after separating out the ancillary qubit form the unified qubit . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the attack strategy is effective on the multiple - way protocol @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that alice has a properly designed filter to reject the unnecessary of photons with split wave length as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so eve has some difficulty to distinguish ancillary form the full qubit and eventually she could not separate out the ancillary qubit form the unified qubit , perfectly . nevertheless , to demonstrate the robustness of our protocol , we allow eve to inject the ancillary qubit which has split wave length compared with the transmitted qubit and to separate the ancillary qubit from the returning qubit .    eve may consider the strategy as follows :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> after the step ( a - mode 1 ) or ( t - mode 1 ) , eve prepares an ancillary state @xmath94 and attaches the ancillary onto the qubit from alice . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit with the ancillary state is @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> eve sends the qubit to bob . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   after the step ( </S>",
    "<S> a - mode 1 ) or ( t - mode 1 ) , the returning qubit becomes @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> eve separates out ancillary and keep the qubit in storage as @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> after the step ( a - mode 3 ) or ( t - mode 3 ) , eve knows the bob s screening angle @xmath23 and measures the qubit in @xmath98 and reads the key @xmath25 .    if eve can distinguish if the protocol is in either t - mode or a - mode . </S>",
    "<S> eve attacks on the protocol only when the protocol is in t - mode . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , she can read the key in the fraction of @xmath28 of the created key , because the ancillary qubit sink into the bob s detector with the fraction of @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , there always exists @xmath13 which satisfies @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 it inevitably induces the collision between two mode . </S>",
    "<S> thus eve can not distinguish the initial qubit state if it is in t - mode or a - mode unambiguously and she could not avoid to intervening during a - mode and her ancillary qubit sink into the bob s detector . </S>",
    "<S> the ancillary qubit which does not carry the information alice s screening angle and authentication angle makes the bob s outcome @xmath103 violating the integrity condition . </S>",
    "<S> thus eve s trojan horse attack should be noticed in the step ( a - mode 3 ) . </S>"
