    "galaxy - galaxy interactions ( collisions and mergers ) are believed to play important roles in shaping present - day galaxies , since they occur frequently in the standard hierarchical model of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "interactions drive not only morphological transformations of galaxies but also bursts of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of researchers have studied roles of galaxy - galaxy interactions using numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many simulations incorporated the interstellar medium ( ism ) and models for star formation and supernova ( sn ) feedback from massive stars .",
    "in such simulations , the numerical resolution is rather limited .",
    "the typical gas mass resolution is about @xmath4 .",
    "because of this limited mass resolution , it was impossible to treat the formation of cold gas phase below @xmath5 .",
    "( see  2 in @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) . in most of early simulations , an isothermal equation of state ( eos ) of @xmath5",
    "was used for the ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "even when the energy equation with a cooling term was used , the minimum temperature was set to be @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some authors @xcite adopted the eos that became harder in higher density .",
    "they argued that such eos mimicked the effect of turbulence motions caused by sne feedback from massive stars . @xcite",
    "employed a multiphase ism model involving a low - temperature phase under @xmath5 , although the modeling of ism was rather simple and mass resolution was low .",
    "low - resolution simulations did not work well under the situation of strong galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "observations of interacting galaxies often show shock - induced , widespread star - formation activities involving star cluster formation ( e.g. , the antennae and the mice galaxies ) , whereas previous simulations showed that most of star formation activities was concentrated to the central regions of the galaxies . @xcite demonstrated that the collision simulations with the isothermal ism and the star - formation model governed by the local energy dissipation rate in shocks can reproduce large - scale starburst formed at the collision interface during the first collision .",
    "however , his shock - induced star formation model introduced an additional parameter and required the fine tuning of model parameters for star formation .",
    "the schmidt law @xcite has been used as star formation model ; @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the stellar density and gas density , respectively , @xmath10 is the local dynamical time , and @xmath11 is the dimensionless star formation efficiency .",
    "since the isothermal eos prevents ism to form small - scale structures , in most simulations , stars had to be formed in fairly low - density gas .",
    "recent models employ the threshold density for star formation , @xmath12 , above which star formation occurs .",
    "sne releases energy into the surrounding ism in the form of thermal or kinetic energy , or internal turbulence motions . when the value of @xmath11 was appropriately tuned , simulations based on these models successfully reproduced observed global properties of star formation in local disk galaxies , in particular the schmidt - kennicutt relation @xcite .",
    "however , simulations with the isothermal eos or the temperature cutoff in cooling functions at @xmath5 failed to reproduce three - dimensional structure of star formation activities , simply because the star formation in these simulation took place effectively everywhere in the gas disk . in paper",
    "i , we demonstrated that high - resolution simulation of the ism with low temperature cooling below @xmath5 , combined with higher threshold density for star formation , gave rise to thin and inhomogeneous star forming regions as observed in isolated disk galaxies .",
    "our high - resolution simulations gave a good description of small - scale structures of star forming regions , and at the same time well reproduced global characteristics such as the schmidt - kennicutt relation .",
    "in this paper , we report the results of high - resolution simulations of a collision between two disk galaxies with realistic ism with cooling term and high - density star - formation criterion for the schmidt - type star formation model .",
    "this ism model is based on the one used in paper i and it can reproduce properties of star - formation in local disk galaxies , without the fine tuning of the value of @xmath11 .",
    "our main conclusion is that high - resolution simulations can resolve shock - compressed regions , and , as a result , these simulations can naturally reproduce a large - scale starburst at the collision interface of gas disks during the first encounter . initially , the density of the gas in the shock - compressed region reaches @xmath13 .",
    "this compressed gas collapses through radiative cooling and gravitational instability in the timescale of @xmath14 and reaches a high density at which star formation is triggered .",
    "thus , our modeling of the ism , which requires sufficiently high - resolution , naturally reproduces the shock - induced starburst . a comparison run , which was performed with the temperature cutoff in cooling function at @xmath15 and relatively low - density threshold for star - formation , displays only a small enhancement of the star formation rate ( sfr ) during the first encounter . by using high - resolution simulations with a realistic star formation model , we can successfully reproduce not only the quiescent star formation in disk galaxies ( paper i ) but also the large - scale starburst at a collision interface and nuclear starbursts observed in interacting galaxies without any extra assumptions .",
    "we used a parallel tree sph code asura ( saitoh , in preparation ) that utilizes the special - purpose hardware grape .",
    "we first constructed near - equilibrium , self - consistent galaxy models with a dark - matter halo and an exponential disk , and then we converted a part of particles into gas particles .",
    "the @xmath0-body realization was generated by galactics @xcite .",
    "our galaxy model is a low - mass , gas rich sc galaxy with the characteristic rotation velocity of @xmath16 .",
    "it has a gradually increasing rotation curve , which is consistent with observations of nearby low - mass galaxies @xcite .",

    "the scale length of the exponential disk is set to be @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we converted @xmath20 of the disk particles , @xmath21 , into gas particles with the exponential profile of an @xmath22 scale length .",
    "we also converted @xmath23 of the dark matter particles into gas particles with the same profile as that of the dark matter halo .",
    "the initial gas temperature is set to be @xmath5 .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy collision is characterized by a prograde parabolic orbit with the pericentric distance @xmath24 and the initial separation of @xmath25 .",
    "the relative velocity at the moment of the pericenter passage is @xmath26 for the point - mass approximation .",

    "we prepare three initial models with different mass resolutions .",

    "the gravitational softening was set to be @xmath27 for all particles in all runs .",
    "the particle mass and number of particles are summarized in table [ tab : numbers ] .",

    "the intensity of the far - ultraviolet radiation is set to be the half of the solar neighborhood value @xcite .",
    "models for the star formation and the sne feedback are similar to those in paper i. we first adopt the model which allows a wide range of temperature for ism ( @xmath30 ) and uses the values @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the threshold density and temperature for the star - formation , respectively .",

    ", we perform a run which only allows the ism temperature above @xmath5 and employs @xmath33 and @xmath34 as the threshold density and temperature for the star - formation , respectively .",
    "the behavior of the ism in this run should be similar to those in previous simulations with isothermal ism of @xmath6 .",

    "figure [ fig : sfr ] shows global sfr during the first encounter . before the encounter , each galaxy has a nearly constant sfr of @xmath47 . for runs m1c , m2c , and m3c , sfr increases by almost an order of magnitude just after the pericenter passage ( @xmath48 ; see the thin curve ) .",
    "we call this peak as a _ starburst_. this duration of the starburst is short and the phase of star formation returns quickly to the quiescent star - formation phase after the first passage . the slightly larger sfr than those seen in the pre - collision might be explained by strong non - axisymmertic perturbations from the companion galaxy @xcite . the behavior of the starburst at the first encounter is similar to that obtained by @xcite who implemented a shock - induced star formation .",
    "also , the difference between runs m1c , m2c , and m3c is very small .",
    "we conclude that our result is independent of the mass resolution as long as the resolution is sufficiently high .",
    "in contrast to these ` c ' runs , run m1a shows very small enhancement of sfr during the first encounter .",
    "the difference in sfr is owing to the hydrodynamic pressure of the gas that forms a bulk of the giant filament .",
    "the pressure of gas in run m1a is roughly a thousand times larger than those in runs m1c , m2c , and m3c at the same density , because the gas in run m1a can not cool below @xmath5 while those in runs m1c , m2c , and m3c can cool down to @xmath28 . in run m1a , the high pressure ism in the contact interface resists collapse even under significant compression . as a result ,",
    "the density of the ism is not increased significantly at the interface .",
    "since the timescale of the pericenter passage of the galaxy - galaxy interaction is not very long ( say , @xmath49 ) , in run m1a , a smaller amount of the stars are formed during the first encounter , as long as we adopt the schmidt law for the modeling of the star formation .",
    "figure [ fig : gas ] shows the gas density of run m2c at the orbital plane for six different epochs .",
    "two galaxies first follow the parabolic orbit and then collide at the pericenter ( top panels ) . during the first encounter , the maximum mach number reaches @xmath50 for the cold ( @xmath51 ) gas .",
    "the ism at the collision interface is strongly compressed by shocks and forms a large and dense filament ( see the top - right panel of figure [ fig : gas ] ; @xmath52 ) .",
    "we call it a _ giant filament_. the length of this giant filament at its formation epoch is @xmath53 .",
    "we measured the gas mass in the rectangular box of the size @xmath54 along the giant filament ( the black rectangular box in the top - right panel of figure [ fig : gas ] ) .",
    "the gas mass of the giant filament is @xmath55 .",
    "this mass is about one quarter of the total gas mass in the system .",
    "the stellar mass formed during the starburst phase ( @xmath56 ) becomes @xmath57 % of the initial filament mass .",
    "the distribution of star forming regions is consistent with observations in interacting galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "overall evolution of the colliding galaxies in the first encounter is quite different from those in previous simulations with the isothermal ism and the schmidt - type star formation models .",
    "our high - resolution simulation naturally captures the shock - induced , large - scale starburst at the collision interface . a number of `` star clusters '' form in the giant filament at the starburst phase .",
    "we will study the formation of the star clusters in further details in forthcoming papers .",
    "in addition to the shock - induced starburst in the giant filament , we also find the starburst during a core - merging phase .",
    "figure [ fig : sfr_latephase ] follows the evolution of sfr during this phase . as is shown in this figure , simulations with our model shows starbursts with multiple peaks in the final core - merge phase .",
    "the star formation mainly takes place within compact clumps in this phase .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of ulirgs @xcite .",
    "our simulations successfully reproduce the nuclear starbursts as well as the large - scale starbursts .",
    "we further find the star formation enhancement in the tidal tails .",
    "figure [ fig : pdf ] shows the volume weighted probability distribution function ( pdf ) of run m2c for several different epochs before , during , and after the first encounter .",
    "although there are some noticeable changes in the pdf with time , they are difficult to see because of the large vertical scale . in order to see the changes in the density distribution of the gas more clearly , we plot the mass functions of the gas , @xmath58 , in figure [ fig : mpdf ] . just before the encounter ( @xmath59 ) , an excess of the gas ( bump ) appears at @xmath60 .",
    "by @xmath61 , this bump moved to @xmath62 , and by @xmath63 it almost vanished .",
    "note that this period of @xmath64 coincides with the period of the starburst .",
    "thus , we have a simple and clear picture of the shock - induced starburst ; initially , large amounts of the gas is compressed to @xmath1 . then , this compressed gas cools and become denser through gravitational instability , and when the gas becomes dense enough to form stars , the starburst takes place . the starburst is led mainly by star formation in massive clusters .",
    "after the high - density gas is consumed , the density pdf returns to the quasi - steady state . in figure",
    "[ fig : npdf ] , we show the time variation of the mass in selected density ranges .",
    "the relative changes are larger for higher densities .",
    "moreover , the peak is found at systematically later epochs for higher densities .",
    "the time delay from @xmath65 to @xmath31 is @xmath66 .",
    "this timescale corresponds to the local dynamical time , @xmath67 , and it is faster than the mean evolution timescale in isolated disk galaxies ( @xmath68 ; see figure 10 in paper i ) .",
    "the lifetime of the mass excess in each density range in figure [ fig : npdf ] is around @xmath69 .",
    "as is expected , this timescale corresponds to that of the starburst .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the multiphase ism in the colliding galaxies .",
    "our simulations , for the first time , resolved the shock - induced gas compression and starburst at the collision interface during the first encounter of colliding galaxies , with the density dependent star formation model ( the schmidt law ) .",
    "the behavior of the ism is qualitatively different from the results of previous studies with isothermal ism .",
    "shock - induced starbursts , which have been observed in many interacting galaxies , naturally take place in our high - resolution simulations without any extra assumptions for the star - formation , such as the dependence on the energy dissipation rate @xcite .",
    "in previous simulations with limited resolutions , significant shock - induced starbursts took place only when the presence of the shock itself is used as the criterion for star formation .    in paper",
    "i , we showed that high - resolution simulations with realistic ism and high - density star - formation criterion can reproduce the schmidt - kennicutt relation without the need of the fine tuning of the value of @xmath11 .",
    "previous simulations with isothermal ism and low - density star - formation criterion required fine tuning . in this paper , we showed that high - resolution simulations can directly resolve shock - compressed regions and these simulations can automatically reproduce shock - induced starbursts .",
    "high - resolution ( particle mass less than @xmath70 ) with a realistic star formation model allows us to study both quiescent star formation and starburst modes in @xmath0-body / sph simulations of galaxy formation .    we thank the anonymous referee for his / her insightful comments and suggestions , which helped us to greatly improve our manuscript .",
