    "semimagnetic semiconductors ( smss ) , also known as diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) , have been studied extensively during the past two decades .",
    "recently , there has been a considerable interest in these materials because of their possible applications in spintronics .",
    "optical and magnetic measurements have shown that , in general , iv - vi smss with a 3@xmath3 element as the magnetic ion have a much weaker exchange interaction than that found in ii - vi smss with the same magnetic ions . also , the iv - vi smss with rare earths have a weaker exchange interaction than that found in the same materials with a 3@xmath3 element as the magnetic ion ( for a review see refs . ) .",
    "electron spin resonance investigations in snte with mn , eu , and gd have shown that the exchange interaction between free carriers and magnetic ions is roughly an order of magnitude smaller for eu and gd than for mn .",
    "@xcite the mechanism of the exchange interaction among magnetic ions in iv - vi smss is still not well understood .",
    "our previous investigations of the magnetic properties of pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te   and pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te indicated a small ( @xmath4 1 k ) , antiferromagnetic exchange interaction among magnetic ions.@xcite in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te the absolute value of the exchange constant was about three times smaller than in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te   and decreased with the increasing eu - content . in ref .",
    "_ have observed magnetization steps in the high - field magnetization at milikelvin temperatures in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te and found exchange constant values similar to ours . by comparison with the results in ii - vi smss we came to a conclusion , that in iv - vi smss the dominant exchange mechanism is the superexchange between nearest neighbors ( nn ) . in order to develop a more complete model and to obtain parameters for the exchange interaction ,",
    "we have made complementary measurements of the magnetic specific heat of pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te   and analyzed the results together with the results of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility measurements .",
    "@xcite it turned out that the mechanism of the exchange interaction in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te   may be more complex than just the nn superexchange . to explain the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te   it was necessary to take into account a splitting of the ground - energy state of single mn - ions in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te   and the @xmath5 coupling between magnetic ion spins and free carriers .",
    "in the present paper we report studies of the magnetic specific heat of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te crystals and compare the results with those obtained in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te .",
    "some preliminary data have been recently reported .",
    "@xcite this is a first investigation of the magnetic contribution to the specific heat in rare - earth - doped smss . in the following sections we present the experimental results and analysis of specific heat measurements and give a physical model for the magnetic specific heat of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te .",
    "in theoretical analysis presented in section iii we argue that the experimentally observed magnetic specific heat is mainly due to single europium ions split in the disordered crystal environment .",
    "the splittings of magnetic ions caused by the crystal field are small and have been usually detected in epr experiments . however , for europium in iv - vi semimagnetic semiconductors these splittings are large enough to be observed also in different kinds of measurements . in closely related semiconductors pb@xmath0eu@xmath1s and   magnetization steps due to the splitting of single europium ions have been observed.@xcite in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te we expect a similar effect .",
    "there is no consensus in the literature concerning the mechanism of the ground state splitting of @xmath6 rare earth ions in crystals .",
    "several models were proposed and analyzed.@xcite it seems that at present it is impossible to decide unequivocally which mechanism should be applied to a specific case .",
    "instead , we suspect that in each case several mechanisms should be considered .",
    "therefore , in section iii we consider four different physical mechanisms leading to the splitting and estimate magnitudes of the resulting splittings .",
    "the important part of the theoretical analysis is the incorporation of deformations of the pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te crystal .",
    "these deformations are caused by the difference between eu and pb atoms and it turns out that even relatively small departures from octahedral symmetry may lead to splittings of the order 1 - 10  k. therefore , they should be taken into account in analysis of magnetic specific heat measurements .",
    "the theoretical considerations in the present paper are limited mainly to the case of the @xmath2=0.027 sample . for this sample",
    "most of the magnetic ions are singles , i.e. they have no nearest magnetic neighbors . for the sample with higher concentration of eu , @xmath2=0.073 , although the theory may be applied formally , its quantitative predictions are not very reliable , because for such a high concentration a significant number of the eu atoms is in larger , many atom clusters and the theoretical analysis of such a system is much more difficult .",
    "we have measured the specific heat of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te with @xmath2 values of 0.027 and 0.073 .",
    "the samples of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te were grown by the bridgman technique and the eu concentration was estimated from the amounts of the components introduced into the growth chamber and measured by energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edax ) .",
    "the nominal @xmath2-values were 0.03 and 0.06 with uncertainty of about 20% .",
    "the crystals were cut in the shape of hall bars with typical dimensions 1.5 @xmath7 2 @xmath7 6 mm@xmath8 .",
    "the samples were @xmath9 type with carrier concentrations , from hall measurements , of about 1 @xmath7 10@xmath10 @xmath11 . with increasing @xmath2 the hole concentration decreased and the mobility increased .",
    "previously we have measured high - temperature magnetic susceptibility and low - temperature , high - field magnetization of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te with @xmath2 up to 0.1 .",
    "@xcite by fitting the susceptibility data to the curie - weiss law we obtained the average eu content in our samples @xmath12 and very small curie - weiss temperatures indicating an antiferromagnetic exchange between eu ions , @xmath13 = -0.38  k and -0.27  k for @xmath14 = 0.027 and 0.073 , respectively .",
    "the measurements of the heat capacity were performed in a cryostat using @xmath8he and @xmath15he systems over the temperature range 0.5 - 15 k in magnetic fields 0 , 0.5 , 1 , and 2 t. we used the standard adiabatic heat - pulse method .",
    "@xcite errors in the heat capacity values were about 5% .",
    "the experimental details have been described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    in order to obtain the magnetic contribution to the specific heat , @xmath16 , it was necessary to subtract the specific heat of the pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te lattice from the measured total specific heat of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te .",
    "this was not a simple task .",
    "_ found that the specific heat of pbte has an anomaly below 5 k and could not be fitted with the standard expression @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electronic and lattice contributions , respectively.@xcite in fact , they could not obtain a satisfactory fit to their data with an expression of the form , @xmath20 unless @xmath21 was at least 10 .",
    "therefore , we measured the heat capacity of our own bridgman - grown pbte sample in zero magnetic field and 2 t , over the temperature range from 0.5 to 15 k and found that the temperature dependence was the same for 0 and 2 t within our experimental error ( as expected ) . in ref .",
    "we described this experiment and have shown the specific heat of pbte vs temperature in zero magnetic field . in our preliminary paper",
    "we have shown the result of simple subtraction of the pbte specific heat from the pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te specific heat .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we take into account the effect that the replacement of pb with an atomic mass of 207.2 by eu with an atomic mass of 151.97 leads to a decrease in heat capacity , even for small values of @xmath2 . to account for this we divided the entire set of pbte specific heat data by empirically determined factors , 1.11 for @xmath2=0.073 and 1.04 for @xmath2=0.027 , before subtracting from the pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te . these factors were determined by assuming that at temperatures above 15 k , in the absence of an applied magnetic field , the magnetic contribution to the specific heat of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te is negligible .",
    "therefore , this division by 1.11 ( 1.04 ) gave results for pbte that were the same as those for pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te at 15 k for @xmath2 = 0.073 ( 0.027 ) . since this is an empirical correction , we emphasize in the present work the data at temperatures below 5 k where the lattice specific heat is much smaller than the total specific heat .",
    "in the interesting region , below 2 k , the specific heat of pbte was more than 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te .",
    "the magnetic specific heat data for pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te are shown in figs.[fig1 ] and [ ft1 ] .",
    "we believe that the scatter in the data represents the experimental error . for both @xmath2-values",
    "there is a broad maximum in the magnetic specific heat at about 2 k in zero magnetic field .",
    "the maximum is several times higher than that predicted by the cluster model of superexchange interaction between nearest neighbors . at higher magnetic fields the value of specific heat at the maximum increases and above 0.5 t it shifts to higher temperatures ; for @xmath2 = 0.073 the shift is smaller than for @xmath2 = 0.027 .",
    "this behavior is different from that observed in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te @xcite or sn@xmath0mn@xmath1te , @xcite where the value of the magnetic specific heat at zero magnetic field and all higher fields was nearly the same , but the shift of the maximum with increasing magnetic field was bigger than in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te .     magnetic specific heat of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te with x = 0.073 in various magnetic fields .",

    "points - experimental data , lines - theoretical predictions of the nearest neighbours interaction model for b=0 ( continuous line ) and b=0.5  t ( broken line ) . ]",
    "before we start the analysis of magnetic specific heat ( msh ) let us recall the model of the europium atom in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te which describes quite well magnetization and magnetic susceptibility experimental data.@xcite    the electron configuration of a free eu atom is @xmath22 .",
    "it is believed that when it replaces a pb atom in pbte the electrons from the outermost shell , @xmath23 , play the role of @xmath24 electrons of pb and contribute to crystal bindings .",
    "due to the strong relativistic downward shift , the energy position of @xmath23 pb electrons is deeply in the valence band.@xcite as a result we obtain eu@xmath25 ion , electrically inactive with respect to the crystal , despite the fact that it replaces pb atom from iv group .",
    "such a picture is confirmed by the fact that the presence of even 10% of eu atoms has almost no effect on carrier concentration.@xcite + according to hund s rule the ground state of eu ion is @xmath6 , it means that seven @xmath26 electrons form the spin s=7/2 and the total angular momentum l=0 .",
    "thus , the ground state of the ion is eightfold degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is removed by external magnetic field , * b * or by interaction with another magnetic ion . with such assumptions",
    "the hamiltonian for the spin subsystem reads @xmath27 where the @xmath28-factor @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath31 is the exchange integral between the @xmath32-th and @xmath33-th spins . if the content of eu is small , of the order of 1 - 3% , we may safely assume that most of the ions have no nearest magnetic neighbors and only small percentage of them form two or three - atom clusters called , in the literature , pairs , open triangles , and closed triangles . assuming the statistical distribution of eu atoms in the pbte lattice , one knows the average number of singles and the average number of atoms in pairs , open triangles , and closed triangles.@xcite then every thermodynamic quantity , in particular the magnetic specific heat , may be calculated .",
    "although such a cluster model is successful in description of magnetization in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te@xcite it fails in the case of msh . in fig .",
    "[ ft1 ] we see that the calculated msh is much smaller than the one observed experimentally .",
    "the calculated msh in fig .",
    "[ ft1 ] , for @xmath34=0 is due to pairs and triples only , because the contribution from singles , which are for @xmath35 eight fold degenerate , is zero .",
    "the specific heat due to larger clusters has , for a sample with @xmath2=0.027 , a very small contribution of about 2.5 % .",
    "we also think that theories like extended nearest neighbor pair approximation ( ennpa)@xcite based on the long range mechanism of spin - spin interaction , are not applicable to pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te because even the nearest neighbor eu - eu exchange integral in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te is small , @xmath36 - 0.25 k@xcite , and more distant interactions , which quickly decay with the distance , can not explain the broad maximum for msh for b=0 .",
    "let us also note , that for nonzero magnetic field the theoretical curve above 1  k lies well below the experimental points .",
    "this picture gives evidence for a non - negligible density of energy states in the energy region far above 2  k , which must be taken into account to describe the experiment properly .",

    "@xmath35 we obtain information about the degeneracy of the ground state in zero external magnetic field .",
    "estimations , based on experimental results presented in ref .  , suggest that in the case of pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te   this difference is nearly zero ( see fig .  [ ft2 ] ) .",

    "thus , the experimental data suggest that in the case of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te in magnetic field @xmath34=0 we have non - negligible degeneracy of the ground state of the spin system .",

    "the lack of degeneracy in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1te   has been discussed in .    at this point",

    "secondly , we have no data at temperatures below 0.5  k , a region which may significantly contribute to the value of the integral .",
    "that is why the estimations of the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ t2 ] are only semiquantitative and can not serve as a rigorous justification of the approach introduced below . however , we think that they provide important insight into the problem and to some degree confirm the considerations given below .    in the present paper",
    "we propose that the experimentally observed msh in zero magnetic field is due to the splitting of the energy levels of the single eu ions . from the discussion of different aspects of splitting that are presented later",
    ", it turns out that this splitting is caused primarily by two mechanisms : the disordered crystal field potential , which leads to virtual @xmath49 transitions , and the internal spin - orbit coupling on @xmath26 shell in the excited , @xmath50 , state .",
    "according to the kramers theorem , the ground state of a single ion ( of a system consisting of seven , i.e. an odd number of electrons on @xmath26 shell ) is at least two - fold degenerate in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , the ground state of the spin subsystem , a significant part of which consists of such split noninteracting ions , is also degenerate .",
    "such an approach is in accordance with the experimentally observed difference between the integrals , eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) , for zero and nonzero magnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the split singles contribute to the magnetic specific heat ; therefore we expect our model describing the experiment to be better than the calculated curves in fig .",
    "[ ft1 ] . in the following analysis",
    "an important role is played by @xmath51 levels of europium .",
    "let us discuss now the origin and the meaning of these states involved in the excited configuration @xmath50 of an ion .",
    "in the investigations of pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te by krenn _",
    "et al._@xcite the optical dipole transitions from the @xmath26 level of eu to the vicinity of the bottom of conduction band were studied .",
    "the photon energy of these transitions for eu concentrations corresponding to ours was found to be less than 1 ev .",
    "notice that this kind of transition may take place only between states of different parity .",
    "because the @xmath52 functions have odd parity , the states near the bottom of the conduction band must contain states of even parity .",
    "in pure pbte the wave functions of the bottom of the conduction band , of @xmath53 symmetry , are of odd parity .",
    "thus , to explain the existence of the optical transition we must assume that in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te the wave functions in the vicinity of the bottom of conduction band have certain components of even parity .",
    "the question arises about the origin of these components .",
    "the most natural candidates are @xmath51 levels of eu .",
    "since it is known that in eute the conduction band is built mainly from @xmath51 and @xmath54 states of europium,@xcite one may expect that the addition of a few percent of eu to pbte will result in a contribution of @xmath51 states to the conduction band states .",
    "of course , the presence of even parity states may be also related to the disorder introduced by addition of eu atoms to pbte because , strictly speaking , the group theory considerations apply only to the perfect crystals and for pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te containing several percent of eu their conclusions can not be taken too rigorously . in the approach presented below we model these states by a single , localized level of @xmath3 symmetry , which we refer to as the @xmath51 level of eu .",

    "we assume that @xmath67 .    due to the difference between eu and pb atoms , also the eu - te and pb - te distances in pb@xmath0eu@xmath1te are different .",
    "this difference causes local lattice deformations .",
    "these deformations are not limited to the nearest neighborhood , but extend over larger distances ( several lattice constants ) .",
    "if the concentration of eu atoms is very small , the average distance between eu atoms is large .",
    "then , although the crystal lattice is locally deformed , the symmetry of the eu surrounding is still preserved . however , with the increasing europium content , the deformations originating from the different atoms start to overlap . due to a random placement of eu atoms in the lattice",
