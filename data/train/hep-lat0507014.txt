    "the dynamics of modes scattering and re - scattering off one another resembles the corresponding picture in quantum field theory .",
    "if we assume the phase of each mode is randomly distributed , then lorentz invariant correlation functions arise upon averaging over phases .",
    "for example if we consider @xmath2 theory , the value of @xmath3 after averaging over phases equals the vacuum expectation value @xmath4 of quantum field theory .",
    "this vacuum expectation value in combination with the @xmath2 term produces a mass correction that is exactly the one - loop correction in quantum field theory .",
    "classical zero - point fluctuations of _ free massless _",
    "scalar and vector fields , the lorentz invariance thereof , and the effects of phase averaging , have been considered before , most notably by boyer @xcite . by studying correlation functions of random electromagnetic fields , and the behavior of charged systems in their presence ,",
    "boyer has emphasized interesting similarities to quantum mechanics .    in an accompanying paper ,",
    "two of the present authors have considered the dynamics of background fluctuations with an @xmath1 energy spectrum in interacting classical field theory .",
    "they showed that a lattice formulation allows for a nonperturbative analysis of the classical evolution equations .",
    "they found critical , strong coupling behavior in @xmath0 theory that is strikingly similar to what is known about the quantum field theory .",
    "they also developed a perturbative expansion of the classical theory in the continuum and found a loop expansion very similar to , but apparently not identical to , that of quantum field theory .",
    "all of this motivates the present work , where we attempt a more quantitative comparison of the classical and quantum theories , where both are defined on the lattice .    in the classical theory it is easy to implement the time evolution of the system , and we expect the configuration at a later time to incorporate the effects of interactions . from the 2-point correlator we can obtain the physical mass , to be compared with the physical mass obtained by conventional methods from the lattice quantum theory .",
    "our interest here is not in the continuum limit of these lattice theories , or the corresponding critical behavior .",
    "we wish to compare physical masses that are safely above the inverse size of the systems , and safely below the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "our focus is on the loop corrections to these masses .",
    "this means that effects at two - loops or higher will need to be extracted , since we already know that the one - loop effects of the two theories agree .",
    "there are extensive studies of classical field theories and their simulation in the literature , typically to approximate quantum field theories in thermal backgrounds or other backgrounds with high occupation number @xcite . in some of these studies",
    "one component of the initialized classical field does model the zero point spectrum of the quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "but even then the focus has been on the dynamics of the thermal component , and not on how the interactions are manifested on the vacuum part .",
    "one of the common objects of study is the plasmon ( or landau ) damping rate , related to the imaginary part of the on - shell self - energy @xcite .",
    "instead we compare to zero temperature field theory and study how closely the classical theory simulates quantum mass renormalizations , and thus our interest is in the real part of the self - energy .",
    "we study a classical @xmath2 theory in 1 + 1 minkowski space on a lattice .",
    "the action is @xmath5 where we employ the units @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the lattice spacing along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "the integers @xmath9 and @xmath10 label the sites in the @xmath11 and @xmath8 directions , and @xmath10 runs from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "a periodic boundary condition is imposed along the @xmath8 direction , i.e. @xmath14 . the equations of motion are obtained from the action and we adopt a leapfrog method to numerically integrate them . @xmath15 the leapflog scheme can be shown to be reversible and has second order accuracy .",
    "we obtain accurate classical evolution with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lattice spacing along the time direction .",
    "( decreasing @xmath17 did nt significantly change our results . )    in quantum field theory , each mode contributes @xmath1 to the zero - point energy and thus the initial configuration of interest is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a phase parameter , and @xmath20 is the lattice dispersion relation .",
    "we leave the mass @xmath21 as a parameter since the physical mass will be different from the bare mass @xmath22 .",
    "one can easily check that the energy of each mode equals @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the phases @xmath19 are independent parameters and we assume each @xmath19 is randomly distributed over @xmath26 . then , for example , we obtain the following average values @xmath27 we shall use @xmath28 to denote this average over the phases .",
    "this averaging gives an interesting indication of the emergence of quantum effects if we compute the average values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 where the r.h.s of the second line is the real part of the 2-point function in lattice quantum field theory , i.e. the real part of the feynman propagator .",
    "this implies that the mass shift induced from the interaction term of the classical action is exactly the same as the one - loop mass correction in quantum field theory",
    ".    we shall use ( [ ph0 ] ) as the starting point for the investigation of the interacting theory .",
    "the key point is that the classical evolution of classical fields can be easily carried out in the presence of interactions and the configuration at a later time incorporates the interacting dynamics",
    ". we can use ( [ ph0 ] ) to specify the initial conditions , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but evolve forward in time with the full @xmath33 equations of motion ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we then compute correlators @xmath34 where @xmath9 and @xmath35 are sufficiently far away from the initial time .",
    "we obtain the average values by repeatedly computing @xmath36 starting from different sets of random phases . to reduce statistical noise",
    "we make use of translational invariance to also average over space .",
    "various correlation functions can be calculated with respect to the final time slice of the simulation , at @xmath37 .",
    "the time correlator @xmath38 , the space correlator @xmath39 , and the zero - mode time correlator @xmath40 are defined as follows . @xmath41 any of these correlators can be used to extract mass , by fitting to the corresponding free field quantities .     and @xmath42 .",
    "it is well fit by analytical free correlator with @xmath43 ( the lines completely overlap ) .",
    "also shown is the free correlator with @xmath44 . ]        for an example we use @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath42 , and @xmath47 .",
    "we generate @xmath48 trajectories with an initial mass parameter @xmath25 , and obtain the correlation functions at @xmath49 .",
    "a least squares fit to free correlators with an adjustable mass produces a more appropriate input mass @xmath21 .",
    "we produce another 5000 trajectories with this @xmath21 as input , and then obtain a new @xmath21 .",
    "this process is repeated until the input mass agrees with the extracted mass .",
    "we find that it converges fast , typically in three interations . in this case",
    "the iteration converges to the value @xmath50 .",
    "all three correlators have excellent fits to the corresponding free correlators with this mass .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "( [ figa]-[figb ] ) . for comparison",
    "we have also displayed the significantly different free correlators with @xmath25 , to clearly show the effect of the mass renormalization .",
    "we shall find that almost all of this mass shift , to within a percent or two , is due to the one - loop renormalization .",
    "we will have to go beyond one - loop in the following .",
    "however this example has already demonstrated some important features of the classical simulation .    *",
    "the system tends to evolve towards the renormalized physical mass from whatever mass is used to specify the initial condition . *",
    "the masses from the various correlators agree .",
    "this is an indication that lorentz symmetry breaking due to lattice effects is not significant . *",
    "the physical mass can be determined to high accuracy .",
    "the one - loop graph calculated on a lattice with discrete space and continuous time , after a wick rotation , is given by @xmath51 this one - loop mass renormalization effect can be used to define the one - loop gap equation , @xmath52 by obtaining the self - consistent mass @xmath53 from this equation we effectively sum up graphs with chains of bubbles , where each bubble represents @xmath54 . from the gap mass",
    "we may define a dimensionless coupling @xmath55 , and the extent to which the gap equation can be trusted will be determined by this coupling .",
    "the gap equation provides a useful representation of the physics for quite a large region of the @xmath56-@xmath57 plane .",
    "this is because the one - loop graph is the only ( log ) divergent graph in this @xmath58 dimensional theory , and it thus dominates .    for the previous example we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 , to be compared with",
    "the mass extracted from the simulation of @xmath61 .",
    "is much closer to @xmath62 than is @xmath22 , in practice we use @xmath53 as the initial trial mass @xmath21 to start the simulation . ] given that there are two - loop corrections to the gap mass that are not included in the one - loop gap equation , our goal then is to decide whether the difference between our extracted mass and the gap mass is consistent with the size of the two - loop corrections from quantum field theory .",
    "we will first need to discuss the errors and uncertainties inherent in the classical simulation , and work to reduce them , in order to obtain the required accuracy .",
    "then we need to determine what the quantum corrections actually are , and for this we will consider both lattice monte carlo methods and lattice perturbation theory .    at least at weak coupling",
    "we have seen that the evolving classical field configuration quickly settles down to a stable configuration that incorporates the effects of interactions .",
    "the stability of an interacting system with a nonthermal energy spectrum ( an @xmath63 spectrum ) is itself nontrivial , but at least in the continuum the @xmath63 spectrum is at a lorentz invariant symmetry point , and thus stability may be a consequence .",
    "but on a lattice there is lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the lattice itself , and this is expected to lead to thermalization .",
    "thermalization of classical fields on a lattice is a well studied phenomena @xcite . and",
    "consistent with these studies , our results indicate that the thermalization time scale is very long compared to the time scales of interest to us ; on these shorter time scales , and for weak to moderate coupling , the interacting quantum - like configurations are very nearly free of thermalization effects .",
    "presumably the lattice lorentz symmetry breaking does not strongly affect the physics below the lattice cutoff .",
    "given the observed stability at weak coupling we can ask how far we should evolve forward in time to obtain the correlators .",
    "we are motivated to average over a fairly long range of time for the following reason .",
    "when we extract the mass for different choices of @xmath49 we find that the extracted mass fluctuates slightly as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "for the example above it fluctuates within a @xmath64 band .",
    "this indicates that the configuration is not completely stationary , even if it is stable .",
    "but since the mass fluctuates around a stable central value , we may average the masses obtained over a range of @xmath49 and thus obtain an accurate mass .",
    "there is more of a problem for large couplings . here",
    "we find that the central value can slowly drift in one direction as @xmath49 increases to large values , in which case we are unable to obtain a reliable mass .",
    "this could be taken as a sign of mild thermalization effects .. ] it is also sensitive to the size of the mass ; for masses , @xmath65 , the drift for increasing @xmath49 is towards higher mass , while for @xmath66 it is towards lower mass .",
    "for @xmath67 up to a few hundred the drift does nt show up until @xmath68    we have also seen that we can extract mass from three different correlators .",
    "of the three we find that the space correlator is the least reliable .",
    "it shows the most sensitivity to numerical errors and @xmath49 dependence .",
    "this is related to the fact that it is an exponentially decreasing function , and thus a fit is sensitive to only a small spatial range inversely proportional to the mass .",
    "the zero - mode correlator @xmath40 and the time correlator @xmath38 tend to agree well with each other .",
    "but the pure sinusoidal oscillations exhibited by @xmath40 for small couplings tend to become damped oscillations at large coupling , due to the mild thermalization effects .",
    "we thus concentrate on the time correlator @xmath38 .",
    "our prescription is to average over twenty equally spaced values of @xmath49 up to a final time @xmath69 ( a temporal extent 10 times the spatial extent ) to obtain a mass .",
    "we then average between @xmath70 and @xmath71 to obtain a second mass .",
    "if the second mass does not deviate significantly from the first , then we accept the first mass as a reliable extracted mass .",
    "we also note that the time correlator contains useful information in its deviation in functional form from the best fit free correlator , this effect becoming visible at larger coupling ( it is not visible in the weak coupling correlators in figs .",
    "( [ figa]-[figb ] ) ) . these deviations in form",
    "are expected since the mass corrections at higher loops are momentum dependent .",
    "we now turn to the extraction of the mass in a lattice quantum theory .",
    "we would like to use an action and a lattice as similar as possible to the classical theory .",
    "however , standard lattice methods for the quantum theory make it necessary to wick rotate the time direction , and a periodic boundary condition is imposed along it as well , giving a periodic euclidean space .",
    "correspondingly we take @xmath72 rather than the @xmath73 in the classical simulation .",
    "then the action for lattice quantum field theory is @xmath74    the different lattice regularization causes an obvious difference in the value of the one - loop self - energy graph ( to be compared with ( [ onel ] ) ) , which now becomes @xmath75 the gap equation for this theory ( where the subscript e stands for the euclidean lattice ) is @xmath76 the resulting values @xmath77 and @xmath78 will thus differ from @xmath53 and @xmath79 from our previous gap equation .",
    "it is useful to graphically compare the results of these gap equations .",
    "( [ f ] ) and ( [ fb ] ) show the behavior of lines of constant @xmath79 and @xmath78 in the @xmath80-@xmath57 plane .",
    "we see that large @xmath79 occurs when @xmath56 is sufficiently negative .",
    "the largest coupling line on this graph is @xmath81 , which is the value of the critical coupling as determined by previous monte carlo simulations of the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the gap mass , the physical mass is expected to vanish on this line .",
    "we see that the @xmath82 line has quite a different behavior at small @xmath57 since it does not intersect the origin .",
    "the reason for the difference is that @xmath83 as @xmath84 while @xmath85 .",
    "we further illustrate the differences in the two lattice regularizations in fig .",
    "( [ g ] ) , where we compare the lines of constant gap masses .",
    "we see that the differences basically grow linearly with @xmath57 .",
    "we would like to account for this obvious source of difference when extracting the physical masses .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the deviation of the physical mass in each theory from the respective gap mass .",
    "the leading order deviation from the gap mass is a finite two - loop effect , and we expect that the lattice dependence of this leading order difference will be small .",
    "this gives us reason to focus our study of the physical masses at weaker coupling .",
    "also displayed in fig .",
    "( [ g ] ) is a special line of constant gap mass , where the gap masses of the two theories agree . for @xmath45",
    "this occurs at @xmath86 . and",
    "since the gap masses agree , @xmath87 along this line .",
    "thus in the vicinity of this line the obvious differences between the two theories are minimized .",
    "in particular the two theories would agree on the location of the critical point along this line .    in our lattice quantum simulations",
    "we start with a hot start , and as our updating scheme we choose the heat - bath algorithm followed by a wolff step to reduce critical slowing down .",
    "` one update ' of the lattice consists of visiting each site with the heat - bath algorithm and then applying a wolff single - cluster step @xcite .",
    "we monitor the relative size of the generated wolff clusters , and we ensure that the system has thermalized by monitoring the action .",
    "the autocorrelation time @xmath88 is estimated by measuring the autocorrelation function @xmath89 of various operators , such as @xmath90 and the action , and computing the integrated autocorrelation time according to @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 is such that for @xmath94 , @xmath89 is essentially noise .",
    "the physical mass is obtained by fitting the correlation function @xmath95 to a @xmath96 or a decaying exponential . here",
    "@xmath97 is the thermal expectation value over different configurations .",
    "the systematic errors are the most difficult to control . to monitor these we compare results at neighboring values for parameters where similar results are expected .",
    "we also repeat the same simulations with different random number generator seeds .    as a check on the quantum simulation",
    "we find that it does give physical masses compatible with the gap equation , to the extent that the gap equation can be trusted .",
    "the mass extracted at strong coupling is also consistent with the expected critical behavior .",
    "the decrease of the physical mass towards zero as @xmath98 is increased serves as one method for the determination of the location of the critical line . for another , the order parameter @xmath99 and its histogram can be studied as the size of the lattice is changed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the same data can be used to extract a critical exponent @xmath100 defined by @xmath101 in all these studies we obtain results from our quantum simulation consistent with previous studies .",
    "but the quantum simulation proved to be rather deficient at producing the type of precision that is needed in our study .",
    "a meaningful comparison to the classical theory requires that we accurately determine the difference between the physical mass and the gap mass . for a @xmath102 lattice , and for a run time of the order of a few days to extract a mass at a single ( @xmath22 , @xmath57 ) point , a large percentage error still arose in the mass difference .",
    "this error seems to be related to problems with correlated data and/or autocorrelation , and it is exacerbated for smaller physical mass .",
    "this ruled out any meaningful comparison of the theories along the special line @xmath86 that we identified above .",
    "but as we shall see shortly , the quantum simulation results will still serve a useful purpose .",
    "we turn to improving the gap equation itself .",
    "although the gap equation is nonperturbative in the sense that it resums an infinite set of graphs , it omits some effects of second order and higher in the coupling . at leading perturbative order the difference between the physical mass and the gap mass",
    "is determined by a single two - loop diagram , the `` sunset '' diagram : +        in the lattice version of the quantum theory , on the square euclidean lattice , this diagram is given by an explicit multiple summation , @xmath103 here @xmath104 represents an external momentum .",
    "this calculation gives a correction to the 2-point function at what corresponds to space - like external momentum , since this is a euclidean quantum theory , and we find that @xmath105 monotonically increases as @xmath106 .",
    "the classical theory however has lorentzian signature , and so we actually need @xmath107 at the time - like on - shell momentum .",
    "we will use @xmath108 as an estimate for this .",
    "moreover our calculation is on the square euclidean lattice , rather than the lattice of the classical simulation , but this additional error should be small .    for a @xmath109 improved gap equation to be useful we need to have some idea of the range of @xmath79 over which it is accurate , before even higher order effects become important .",
    "this is where the quantum lattice results are useful .",
    "although there are large errors on the extracted mass correction at any single point in parameter space , when taken collectively the quantum simulation data supports @xmath108 as an estimate of the difference between the physical and gap masses .",
    "this appears to be a good estimate for couplings as large as @xmath110 . as a further check",
    "we have directly estimated the single three - loop graph using the same technique as above ( for smaller lattices ) and found that it is @xmath111 times the size of the two - loop graph .",
    "we therefore consider a two - loop gap equation of the following form , @xmath1123\\pi(m_{\\mathrm{gap}})\\lambda-6\\pi_{2\\mathrm{e}}(m_{\\mathrm{gap}},0)\\lambda^{2}. \\label{tl}\\ ] ] we have inserted a correction factor in the @xmath57 term to account for possible lattice artifacts or finite size effects inherent in our classical simulation . that we have noted earlier . ]",
    "it is important to account for this because a small correction in the @xmath57 term can compete in size with the @xmath113 term .",
    "similarly a correction to the @xmath113 term of similar size can safely be ignored .",
    "this gap equation can be considered as a quantum model to be tested against the classical simulation data .",
    "our strategy then is to use ( [ tl ] ) as a one parameter model for the extracted physical mass @xmath114 from the classical simulation .",
    "we run the simulation for a range of values of @xmath22 and @xmath57 that produce values for @xmath114 very close to a fixed @xmath115 , and thereby determine @xmath116 through a best fit .",
    "we choose the couplings @xmath117 .",
    "we use 5000 trajectories for each determination of a mass . for the four values",
    "@xmath118 we find @xmath119 .",
    "to test the quantum model for @xmath114 we write it in terms of the dimensionless coupling @xmath120 and then isolate the @xmath109 dependence to get @xmath1213\\pi(m_{\\mathrm{gap}})m^2_{\\mathrm{gap}}g\\}}{-6\\pi_{2\\mathrm{e}}(m_{\\mathrm{gap}},0 ) m^4_{\\mathrm{gap}}}. \\label{gg}\\ ] ] we then determine the r.h.s from the classical simulation for a fixed @xmath115 and for a range of @xmath22 and @xmath79 that give @xmath122 .",
    "this is displayed in the plots in fig .",
    "( [ fige ] ) where we see the residual quadratic dependence on @xmath79 , and compare to the superimposed @xmath109 line of the quantum model .",
    "( the points would lie along a straight line if there was no @xmath109 effect . )",
    "the spread of the points for 10 different random number seeds gives an indication of the errors .",
    "of the four choices of @xmath115 , the errors in the @xmath123 plot are the smallest ( largest ) , and for larger masses the errors again grow larger . in section 3",
    "we have already noted that @xmath124 suffers least from the mass drift phenomenon at strong coupling , and thus the pattern of errors observed here are correlated with that phenomenon .",
    "in fact the drift is found to occur for @xmath125 in the @xmath126 case , and 0.5 points should not be considered reliable . ] and we can see how the sign of the drift tends to skew the @xmath109 effect towards a larger value .",
    "the other three plots show that the results of the classical simulation are very well described by the quantum model , where the coefficient of the @xmath113 term is given by the sunset diagram of quantum field theory .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "we can also consider a two parameter fit to the data in these three plots , where we allow the coefficients of both the @xmath57 and @xmath113 terms to vary .",
    "this yields a @xmath113 coefficient @xmath127 larger than the quantum prediction . for an independent set of data for masses @xmath128 from 60 to 200 ,",
    "where we only considered values of @xmath79 up to @xmath129 , we obtained values for the @xmath113 coefficient that deviated between @xmath130 and @xmath131 from the quantum value .",
    "all these deviations are similar to the theoretical error in our estimate of the two - loop graph on mass shell .",
    "* plots of the r.h.s of equation ( [ gg ] ) versus @xmath79 showing a comparison between the classical simulation and the quantum model . * the graphs are labelled by @xmath67 and the solid line is the @xmath109 quantum field theory prediction .",
    "each plot displays the results of 10 different random number seeds . ]",
    "it is instructive to consider again lines of constant @xmath53 on the @xmath80-@xmath57 plane , where we now use the corrected two - loop gap equation ( [ tl ] ) . in fig .",
    "( [ figc ] ) we compare the result to the original one - loop gap equation , by showing the effect of the @xmath132 correction with no @xmath113 term , and then the effect with the @xmath113 term added as well .",
    "this figure highlights the fact that the simulation has to be highly accurate to see the small @xmath113 effect .",
    "we have attained this level of precision in the classical simulation , and we have come nowhere close to it using conventional monte carlo methods in the quantum theory .",
    "we have discussed the extraction of quantum loop effects from a classical simulation . we considered the time evolution of a scalar field configuration realizing the zero - point energy spectrum of quantum field theory and including an averaging over phases .",
    "the time evolution incorporates the effects of interactions and the trajectory quickly approaches a stable configuration on the time scale of interest , at weak to moderate couplings .",
    "the physical masses obtained from either the time or space correlation functions are in agreement , as would be expected by lorentz invariance .",
    "our method is clearly distinct from quantum simulations and uses only a tiny fraction of cpu time .",
    "this fraction is roughly @xmath133 .    in this way we have been able to perform a precision measurement of the effects of two - loop corrections within a classical simulation , with results that are consistent with quantum field theory . in @xcite two of us",
    "studied the classical simulation at strong coupling and looked at two signatures of critical behavior , the overlap of the space and time correlators signaling masslessness and the development of a vacuum expectation value for the field .",
    "the findings were consistent with the location of the critical line in quantum field theory .",
    "on the other hand in @xcite it was also indicated that the loop expansion of the classical theory was not identical to the quantum theory ; and it was suggested that the sunset diagram , the particular two - loop diagram of interest here , may have missing contributions in the classical theory . due to uncertainties our results here may still be compatible with missing contributions , but they imply that the missing contributions in this case are accidentally small or vanishing .",
    "more generally , any perturbative discrepancy is not easy to reconcile with the success of the classical simulation at both strong and weak coupling .",
    "however this puzzle is resolved , we still find the concept of a classical simulation recovering most or all of a two - loop effect to be rather surprising and unexpected .",
    "note added : for further work on resolving this puzzle see @xcite .",
