    "young high mass stars accrete a significant amount of mass while on the zams , even when surrounded by compact hii regions @xcite .",

    "we present the first interferometric observations of mwc  297 , which is a young 10 m@xmath5 main sequence star of spectral type b1.5 @xcite .",

    "the two sidebands , each of 2  ghz bandwidth , include the rotational transitions ( j=2 - 1 ) of @xmath0co,@xmath1co and c@xmath2o and the correlator was configured to provide a velocity resolution of 0.5  kms@xmath12 for the co  ( 2 - 1 ) line which was centered in the upper sideband .",
    "the observations were made in the compact array configuration of the sma , where the projected shortest and longest baselines were @xmath4  14  m and @xmath4  69  m ( 10 and 53  k@xmath13 ) respectively .",

    "the degree of decorrelation was similar for 1743 - 038 and mwc  297 .",
    "we self calibrated the visibility data for both 1743 - 038 and mwc  297 at a time interval of 4 min , which significantly reduced the phase decorrelation .",
    "the vector averaged visibility amplitude plotted against the @xmath14 distance for mwc  297 and the quasar 1743 - 038 after self calibration is shown in fig .",

    ", it gives a source radius of 80 au .",
    "mwc  297 is known to have an ionized wind associated with it @xcite .",
    "the flux densities at 3.6 cm and 6 cm , measured towards mwc  297 with the vla @xcite , give a spectral index of 0.6 ( f@xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 ) , appropriate for free - free emission from an optically thick , ionized wind .",
    "assuming that this emission continues to the mm wavelengths with the same spectral index , we subtracted the possible contribution due to the free - free emission from the total observed flux at 1.3  mm and obtained a flux density of 200  mjy as due to dust emission .",
    "if the dust emission is optically thin at mm wavelengths , assuming a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 and a dust opacity per unit mass of dust plus gas @xmath28  =  0.005@xmath29^{\\beta}$ ]  @xmath30 @xcite , we obtain a total mass of 0.07 m@xmath5 for the circumstellar material ( gas+dust ) associated with mwc  297 .",
    "a dust temperature of 100  k is assumed in this calculation . from the mass and the upper limit to the source radius , we computed the optical extinctions along the line of sight through the continuum source to the central star to probe the geometry of the circumstellar material .",
    "if the circumstellar material is distributed in a spherical envelope of uniform density , the optical v - band extinction would be @xmath10 10@xmath31  mag .",
    "however , the observed extinction @xmath32 is only 8 mag @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that the circumstellar dust is likely distributed in a comparatively flattened and inclined morphology around mwc  297 , perhaps in the form of a disk .    in fig .",
    "[ sed ] we present the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of mwc  297 at submm , mm and cm wavelengths .",
    "we fit the observed points with a combination of free - free emission arising in an ionized wind and optically thin dust emission from a circumstellar disk of mass 0.07  m@xmath5 .",
    "the best fit is obtained when the dust opacity power - law exponent @xmath7 has a value between 0.1 and 0.3 .",
    "this is much lower than that observed for interstellar grains ( @xmath7  =  2 ) and the representative value used for circumstellar disks ( @xmath7  =  1 ) .",
    "the low value of @xmath7 is often interpreted as arising due to the average size of the emitting dust grains being relatively larger .",
    "larger grain size in the circumstellar environment around mwc  297 has also been reported independently from studies on the wavelength dependence of extinction towards the star at the optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this argues for possible grain growth in the optically thin circumstellar material around mwc  297 .    in order to construct the sed and to determine the value of @xmath7",
    ", we have used large beam ( @xmath4 20@xmath20 ) single dish measurements at submm wavelengths with jcmt in conjunction with our interferometric data point at 1.3 mm .",
    "the single dish measurements are likely to have contribution from nearby extended structures .",
    "however , major contribution to the single dish measurements still comes from the compact continuum source that we detect with the sma and therefore , the derived value of @xmath7 should not be significantly affected .",
    "for instance , at 1.3  mm , 60% of the dust emission observed with 19@xmath20 beam of the jcmt @xcite and 74% of the dust emission observed with 11@xmath20 beam of the iram @xcite comes from the compact continuum source of @xmath4  0.@xmath206 in size . assuming that the relative contribution from extended emission to the total dust emission measured with jcmt is the same in all other submm wavelengths and performing a similar fit yields @xmath7  @xmath330.1 .",
    "thus the value of @xmath7 that we derive can safely be treated as an upper limit .",
    "however , we note here that low value of @xmath7 is also consistent with emission from an optically thick disk .",
    "if the 1.3 mm continuum dust emission is optically thick , then the measured flux density implies a disk radius of only @xmath4 28 au . in order to have the optical depth @xmath34  @xmath10 1",
    ", such a disk should have a mass m@xmath35 @xmath10 0.06 m@xmath5",
    ".    we do not detect any co  ( 2 - 1 ) or @xmath1co  ( 2 - 1 ) emission with the sma at any v@xmath36 at the position of the continuum source associated with mwc  297 .",
    "the line of sight extinction of @xmath32  @xmath4 8  mag towards mwc  297 corresponds to co  ( 2 - 1 ) and @xmath1co  ( 2 - 1 ) column densities of about 9 @xmath23  10@xmath37  @xmath38 and 1.5  @xmath23  10@xmath39  @xmath38 respectively @xcite , with an assumed [ @xmath0co]/ [ @xmath1co ] elemental isotope ratio of 60 . the optical depths of co  ( 2 - 1 ) and @xmath1co  ( 2 - 1 ) will be 300/@xmath40  ( kms@xmath12 ) and 5/@xmath41  ( kms@xmath12 ) respectively .",
    "the co  ( 2 - 1 ) emission that we observe towards mwc  297 with the 10 m submillimeter telescope ( smt ) at aro is extended , and has a velocity width of @xmath4  10  kms@xmath12 ( to be published elsewhere ) .",
    "the optically thick , extended foreground co cloud is resolved out by the sma in our observations .",
    "the @xmath1co  ( 2 - 1 ) line has a line width of @xmath4  3  kms@xmath12 ( smt observations , to be published elsewhere ) .",
    "the optical depth of the foreground @xmath1co will be 1 - 2 .",
    "if the @xmath1co  ( 2 - 1 ) line from the circumstellar disk of mwc  297 has a v@xmath36 and a @xmath41 close to those of the foreground @xmath1co , then most of the @xmath1co  ( 2 - 1 ) emission would have been absorbed by the foreground component .",
    "however , a keplerian disk surrounding a central mass of 10  m@xmath5 will have a rotational velocity of @xmath4  11  kms@xmath12 at a radius of 80  au .",
    "@xmath1co emission from such a rotating disk would show a line width reaching 22 kms@xmath12 and we should have detected the high velocity component of the disk emission away from the foreground cloud velocity .",
    "our channel maps ( velocity resolution = 0.5 kms@xmath12 ) at various v@xmath36 in the @xmath1co  ( 2 - 1 ) line indicate no hint of a localized @xmath1co emission at the position of the dust continuum at an rms noise level of 150 mjybeam@xmath12 .    if the @xmath1co emission from the disk is optically thick , our detection limit ( 53 mjybeam@xmath12/4 kms@xmath12 ) implies a source size smaller than the dust disk size .",
    "this is contrary to what is observed generally for cirsumstellar disks where the sizes of the gas disks are a factor of 2 - 3 times larger than the dust disks ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the @xmath0co/ @xmath1co line ratios observed for circumstellar disks in general suggest @xmath1co emission to be optically thin ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath1co emission from the disk surrounding mwc 297 is likely to be optically thin and from our sensitivity limit we obtain an upper limit on the gas mass . if the circumstellar material around mwc  297 is distributed in a keplerian disk of radius 80 au and assuming a gas excitation temperature of 50 k , [ @xmath0co]/ [ @xmath1co ] ratio of 60 and h@xmath42/@xmath0co conversion factor of 10@xmath31 , the upper limit on the gas mass estimated from our detection limit for @xmath1co  ( 2 - 1 ) line emission is 3.5 @xmath23 10@xmath43 m@xmath5 .",
    "this is about 200 times less than the disk mass estimated from dust continuum emission and implies a gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath4 0.5 .",
    "such discrepancies of about 2 orders of magnitudes in the total masses derived from continuum and co line measurements have been known for disks around t tauri stars and herbig ae stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "suggested causes are gas dispersal in the disk , co depletion due to freezing - out onto the grains and photodissociation , or the line emission being partially optically thick ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in the case of mwc  297 , which is a hot , main sequence star , gas dispersal and co depletion due to photodissociation are likely to be important .",
    "mwc  297 is a young , 10  m@xmath5 main sequence star which is already past the major accretion phase and has built up most of its mass .",
    "the star is optically visible indicating that it has cleared most of the surrounding material .",
    "our interferometric observations with the sma show that it is still surrounded by a circumstellar disk of mass 0.07  m@xmath5 and radius @xmath33 80  au .",
    "the disk - like structures detected in high - mass ( m@xmath3 @xmath4 8 - 20  m@xmath5 ) protostars have masses in the range of 1 - 12  m@xmath5 and radii  @xmath10  500  au ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the disk surrounding mwc  297 , therefore , must be the remnant of a more massive disk of the earlier phase , and this supports the proposition that massive stars are formed via disk accretion .",
    "it also demonstrates that circumstellar disks can survive around massive stars well into their main sequence phase even after they have become optically visible .",
    "reported evidence for the existence of keplerian disks surrounding 8  -  10  m@xmath5 herbig be ( hbe ) stars also support this assertion @xcite .",
    "other than mwc  297 , compact dust continuum emission from the circumstellar disks surrounding optically visible early b - type stars ( hbe stars ) has been detected only around two b0 type stars , viz .",
    "mwc  1080 and r  mon . based on the disk masses derived from these observations ,",
    "it has been argued that the disk masses in hbe stars are at least an order of magnitude lower than that in intermediate - mass herbig ae stars and low - mass t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "however , because of the large distance to mwc  1080 ( 2200  pc @xcite ) , the continuum emission detected at 2@xmath44 scale corresponds to a linear scale of @xmath4 4000  au and therefore can not be unambiguously considered as arising from a circumstellar disk . in the case of r",
    "mon , which is at a distance of 800  pc , the continuum emission appears to come from a compact disk of radius 150  au and mass 0.014 m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thus the disk masses estimated for early b - type stars are comparable to those found for herbig ae stars @xcite and t tauri stars @xcite , given the uncertainties in the mass estimates .",
    "the disk surrounding mwc  297 shows evidence for some degree of physical evolution .",
    "if the emission at submm and mm wavelengths is optically thin , then the low value of @xmath7 that we derive implies that the circumstellar dust grains around mwc  297 have sizes larger than the interstellar grains .",
    "this indicates that the grain growth has possibly begun in the disk .",
    "such grain growth has also been inferred for the disk surrounding r mon @xcite .",
    "we also find evidence for significant depletion of co in the disk surrounding mwc 297 .",
    "interestingly , similar results indicating grain growth and depletion of molecular gas in the disks have been reported for low - mass t tauri stars and intermediate mass herbig ae stars @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that the disk evolution proceeds not very differently in the disks surrounding young massive stars from that observed for the disks in low - mass and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "although the depletion of molecular gas and grain growth in the disk seem to indicate that the disk surrounding mwc  297 is relatively evolved , the spectroscopic signatures like a variety of emission lines in the near - infrared and the optical wavelengths show that it is driving a wind and is extremely active ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have successfully modeled the emission lines as arising in a stellar wind with the high velocity ( 600kms@xmath12 ) h@xmath45 and h@xmath7 emission originating from a large and somewhat spherical region while the br@xmath46 line is confined to a narrow region just above the disk where the velocity is dominated by the disk keplerian rotation .",
    "however , what drives this wind is not very clear . direct mass loss from the star and the standard classical be wind models have been found to be unsuccessful in explaining the observed wind properties of mwc  297 @xcite .",
    "the activity in mwc  297 must be related to the circumstellar disk surrounding it and it is likely that the wind is accretion driven . though not very conclusive , spectroscopic evidence seem to suggest that residual accretion persists in the circumstellar disk surrounding mwc  297 .",
    "the disk that we detect around mwc  297 is possibly in an intermediate evolutionary stage between the more massive accretion disk and the debris disk .",
    "the primordial disk material has begun to evolve and the disk is in the process of being dissipated .",
    "it is interesting to note that disks with similar observational characteristics in intermediate - mass and low - mass stars are generally thought to be the sites of planet formation .",
    "this opens up the intriguing possibility of planet formation in the disks surrounding massive stars .",
    "however , detailed studies of more such objects are needed to explore such a possibility ."
