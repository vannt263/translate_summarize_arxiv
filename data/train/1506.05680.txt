    "various stochastic phenomena have been modeled in terms of the solution @xmath2 of a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath3 on a domain @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a @xmath1-dimensional standard brownian motion , @xmath6 is the time coordinate , and @xmath7 , is a continuously differentiable function . the monte carlo simulation is a powerful and very popular approach to study such a stochastic model .",
    "the standard method for generating a path which follows the sde is the euler  maruyama scheme that constructs an approximating sequence of processes @xmath8 as @xmath9 for @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is an increasing sequence of stopping times , usually chosen to be a deterministic sequence such as @xmath12 .",
    "the variable @xmath13 controls the computational effort of this construction .",
    "we naturally expect that @xmath14 in some sense as @xmath15 .",
    "the attractive features of the euler  maruyama scheme include its validity under degenerate diffusion coefficients with mild regularity , intuitive construction and easy implementation .",
    "see kloeden and platen  @xcite for some elementary properties of this and other related methods .",
    "kurtz and protter  @xcite studied the limit of the approximation error process @xmath16 as @xmath17 .",
    "they showed that if the sequence of @xmath18-dimensional processes @xmath19 defined by @xmath20 is `` good '' and converging to a semimartingale @xmath21 in law , then @xmath22 converges in law to @xmath23 , the solution of @xmath24 since this sde for @xmath25 is affine , we may write @xmath25 in a more explicit form . in particular if @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , then @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the solution of @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the kronecker s delta . for example in the case of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 it is important to note that @xmath35 does not depend on @xmath36 . in consequence ,",
    "the limit distribution @xmath25 of @xmath37 is determined by the limit distribution @xmath38 of @xmath39 in a linear manner . in the equidistant case @xmath12 ,",
    "as shown by kurz and protter  @xcite and jacod and protter  @xcite , we have @xmath40 for all @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a @xmath43-dimensional brownian motion independent of @xmath44 . in particular , we have @xmath26 for all @xmath27 . and that the distribution of @xmath45 is conditionally gaussian .",
    "in this paper we consider more general sequences of partitions @xmath46 .",
    "our first main result states a central limit theorem for the error process and provides a convenient characterization of the resulting process @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us to study the efficiency of different sequences of partitions .",
    "our second main results establishes a uniform lower bound on the expected asymptotic error @xmath25 and shows that the bound is attained by partitions associated with the hitting times of a sphere for @xmath44 .",
    "note that in such a scheme both the time steps @xmath47 and the @xmath44 increments , @xmath48 are random .",
    "the later are uniformly distributed on a sphere and in particular in the one - dimensional case take just two values .",
    "in contrast , in the equidistant case the time steps are deterministic ( and equal ) and all the randomness is coming from the increments of @xmath44 .",
    "newton  @xcite and fukasawa  @xcite studied the hitting time scheme in the one - dimensional case .",
    "cambanis and hu  @xcite and m@xmath49ller - gronbach  @xcite gave optimality results among irregular and adaptive schemes which still use gaussian increments .",
    "our framework of discretisation is more general than these preceding studies .",
    "our result is closely related to a recent work by landon  @xcite , where a sequence of hitting times of ellipsoids is derived as an asymptotically optimal scheme . in this paper , we restrict schemes to be symmetric in a certain sense because , among other reasons , there is unlikely to be a realistic computational algorithm to implement asymmetric schemes .",
    "our framework therefore excludes hitting times of ellipsoids ( except spheres )",
    ".    our theoretical analysis of efficiency described above does not take into account the complexity of simulating random variables with a given distribution , which may be challenging for hitting times of spheres in higher dimensions .",
    "we argue that in practice one should look for a scheme where both the time steps and the spatial increments are random and all are easily generated together .",
    "we achieve this adapting the moving sphere approach in deaconu and herrmann  @xcite .",
    "this scheme is easier to implement and enjoys a better accuracy than the standard gaussian scheme .",
    "in fact , it modifies the standard one only by replacing @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are independent iid sequences .",
    "it improves the accuracy of the monte carlo simulation even after taking into account a slight increase of computational time due to the one additional generation of random variable and the calculation of the exponential function each step",
    ". it also has the further advantage that both the time and @xmath44 increments are bounded .",
    "this enables us to control the size of each increments of @xmath55 and deal with sde on a bounded domain , see milstein and tretyakov  @xcite , or devise efficient pricing of path dependent options e.g.  barrier options .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "we present a central limit theorem for discretisation error . in section  3",
    "we study several examples of schemes and discuss their effectiveness .",
    "in particular , we show one of them to be attractive in terms of both error magnitude and computational costs .",
    "here we present a central limit theorem for the asymptotic error process @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be a probability space .",
    "we suppose that the sde ( [ sde ] ) admits a unique strong solution @xmath58 which does not explode and remains in a given open connected domain @xmath59 .",
    "we further assume there exists a sequence of compact sets @xmath60 with each @xmath60 being a subset of the interior of @xmath61 such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denote by @xmath66 the augmentation of the natural filtration generated by @xmath44 .",

    "put @xmath71 note that @xmath72 is the number of discretisation steps required to generate a path up to a finite stopping time @xmath73 . in this section",
    "we do not take the computational difficulty to generate @xmath74 and @xmath75 into account .",
    "hence we take @xmath72 as a measure of computational effort associated with the partition @xmath70 .",
    "notice that @xmath76 is a stopping time with respect to the discrete filtration @xmath77 .    for a given sequence of partitions @xmath36 , we denote by @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 the corresponding quantities @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for brevity .",
    "we also let @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "for example if @xmath46 is the equidistant scheme , that is , @xmath12 , then we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 as @xmath17 . to see what happens",
